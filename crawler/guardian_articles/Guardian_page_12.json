                    "body": "Ryan Reynolds is no stranger to a dramatic finale, but this will have been one the Wrexham co-owner would have rather not seen. The sequel does not always live up to the hype of the original but after their thrilling 3-3 draw in north Wales nine days earlier, that was anything but the case here on a gripping night at Bramall Lane. In the end though Reynolds, Phil Parkinson and everyone associated with Wrexham may well be wondering what might have been.\nMake no mistake about it, over the course of 90 engrossing minutes Sheffield United were worthy winners. Wrexham\u2019s attention must turn back to promotion from the National League as the Blades prepare for Tottenham in the fifth round of the FA Cup. But as we are beginning to learn with Wrexham since their Hollywood-inspired takeover, nothing is ever really that straightforward.\nHaving bombarded Wrexham for nearly 50 minutes, when Anel Ahmedhodzic finally broke the deadlock and put the Blades into a deserved lead, you wondered if Wrexham\u2019s spirit would break. Not a chance. They battled, fought and with 20 minutes left, levelled when Paul Mullin powered home a penalty to bring the non-league side level and send the 4,000-plus travelling supporters into delirium.\n\nBut the drama was just beginning. Seven minutes later, Mullin had a second chance to convert from the spot after being fouled again in the box. This time though, he was denied by Adam Davies \u2013 and that moment not only proved costly on the night, but it will likely haunt Mullin and Wrexham for some time. Just as the game seemed destined for extra time and the fairytale to remain alive for at least another 30 minutes, the Championship side struck twice in ruthless fashion.\nThey probably should have ended the tie before then. But when Billy Sharp converted in stoppage time to make it 2-1, Wrexham had no choice but to chance their arm. That left them open and three minutes later, Sander Berge finished another break to put the result, finally, beyond doubt.\n\u201cI\u2019m immensely proud of the performance,\u201d Parkinson said. \u201cWe\u2019ve taken a very good team right to the wire, and if that penalty had gone in we\u2019d have gone on and won the game. Everyone thought our best chance of winning the tie had gone but I can\u2019t fault how the lads performed.\u201d\n\nThe final scoreline was perhaps harsh on Wrexham given how they acquitted themselves but if you strip back all the glamour, the quality of the Championship side meant the result was the right one, even with Mullin\u2019s penalty miss. For almost the entire first half the Blades laid siege to Wrexham\u2019s penalty area, but were unable to create any clear opportunities in the opening half hour.\nThe pick of the moments came when James McAtee and Iliman Ndiaye broke downfield after the Senegal striker picked off an undercooked pass from Andy Cannon. McAtee should have squared to Ndiaye, but he opted to shoot \u2013 and he curled the ball around Rob Lainton\u2019s post. But shortly after half-time the deadlock was broken, as Ahmedhodzic shot past Lainton after being freed by Ben Osborn.\nAs the game approached the final quarter, Wrexham responded. Mullin was fouled by Ahmedhodzic and he made no mistake from the spot. Crucially though, he would waste his next opportunity seven minutes later. This time Davies denied him with an impressive save \u2013 and it shifted the momentum back the Blades\u2019 way.\n\nThey attacked Wrexham once again. But just as extra time was looming the Blades showed their class and quality, and there was a collective sigh of relief inside the ground when Sharp steered the ball past Lainton to make it 2-1. Then, with Wrexham stretched and pushing for another equaliser, Berge was freed by McAtee and he made no mistake.\n\u201cThe performance was good, we were good from start to finish,\u201d Paul Heckingbottom, United\u2019s manager, rightly pointed out. \u201cWe topped off what\u2019s been a really good Cup tie with the result.\u201d It certainly was a great tie and despite all the fanfare surrounding Wrexham and how close they came to winning the original tie, this time there could be no arguing the outcome was the right one."

                    "body": "Australia\u2019s love affair with the Melbourne Cup appears to be waning, with a new survey finding more than half have \u201clow\u201d or \u201cno interest\u201d in the race that traditionally stops the nation. Amid growing support for the Nup to the Cup movement, the latest Guardian Essential poll also suggests almost half of those surveyed (45%) believe it promotes \u201cunhealthy\u201d gambling behaviour, with a third (34%) saying it normalises animal cruelty. Ahead of Tuesday\u2019s cup day at Flemington, the poll finds about three-quarters of people (72%) believe the Melbourne Cup is a \u201cunique part of Australia\u2019s national identity\u201d, which is down six percentage points since 2019, despite being up from 67% when the question was asked last year.  Men are more likely to agree with the sentiment compared to women (73% to 71%), but the most marked difference comes from a breakdown of age groups. Only 56% of those aged 18 to 34 view the Melbourne Cup in such a light, compared to 86% of those over the age of 55 and 72% of those aged 35-54. Overall, 15% say they have a high interest in Tuesday\u2019s race, with 31% showing moderate interest, 24% low interest and 28% no interest. The findings come amid falling attendance numbers for the race \u2013 even before the past two years of Covid restrictions \u2013 and a backlash to horse fatalities that prompted a review by Racing Victoria.  Sign up for our free morning and afternoon email newsletters from Guardian Australia for your daily news roundup  But despite the dwindling allure of the Cup, the survey shows that a growing number of people still intend to place a bet, including those who do not consider themselves regular gamblers. Of the 1,038 people surveyed, 47% of people intend to place a bet on Tuesday\u2019s race, including 56% of males and 39% of females, up from 36% last year and 42% in 2020. Overall, 18% of those intending to gamble say they bet regularly on horse races and will place a bet this time. This is up 3% compared to a year ago. Almost a third of people (29%) say they \u201crarely\u201d bet on horse races, but intend to gamble on the Cup, an 8% increase since last year. Women are more likely to be occasional than regular gamblers, with most women (61%) not intending to bet on the race. Middle aged men are the most likely to gamble, with 56% of men saying they will bet on the race \u2013 25% of those say they regularly bet on horse races.  About a third of those polled (34%) say they will not watch the race and will not place a bet, with women and those over the age of 55 the least likely to tune in and gamble at 40% and 41% respectively. And despite young people being more likely than those over the age of 55 to link the cup with unhealthy gambling behaviour and animal cruelty (39% compared to 24%), they are also more likely to gamble than older people. Half of those aged 18 to 34 say they intend to bet on the race, compared to 56% of those aged 35 to 54 and 36% of those over the age of 55. Green and independent voters are most likely to be concerned by gambling and animal cruelty linked to the cup, while almost half of all Labor voters (47%) believe it promotes unhealthy gambling compared to 37% of Coalition voters. The gap is narrower when it comes to animal cruelty concerns, with just 34% of Labor voters and 30% of Coalition voters saying it is an issue."

                    "body": "  6.27pm   Afternoon summary  Here\u2019s a quick summary of what\u2019s happened today in business news:   Elon Musk\u2019s fate as Twitter CEO is uncertain after he released a poll asking Twitter users whether he should step down as head of Twitter. Over 57% of 17.5m users who voted said that he should. Though Musk said he would abide by the results of the poll, he has not made any announcements regarding plans to step down.  A union representing Twitter staff in the UK cautioned that even if Musk steps down as CEO, he would still be owner of the company.  UK spring budget will be delivered on 15 March, chancellor Jeremy Hunt announced today.  The US Federal Trade Commission announced a settlement with Epic Games, the maker of popular video game Fortnite, for a total $520m. The agency said the company violated child privacy protection laws.   We\u2019re pausing this blog for now but will return if any news around Musk and Twitter arises. Thank you for reading.      6.02pm    Two California-based employees are accusing Tesla of retaliation after they were fired while participating in a group that was drafting letters critical of Tesla CEO Elon Musk. The employees filed a complaint with the National Labor Relations Board last week, according to Bloomberg.  The letters drafted by the group asked company executives to reconsider Musk\u2019s return-to-office police, saying that they violated Tesla\u2019s anti-harassment policy. Both employees were fired in June \u2013 one was told that their discussions on Tesla were \u201can attack\u201d on the company.     5.41pm    A week after his arrest last Monday, former FTX chief executive Sam Bankman-Fried is appearing in court in the Bahamas, where is being held in custody. While Bankman-Fried had indicated he would fight extradition charges, it seems that he could agree to an extradition, according to CNN. In court on Monday, Bankman-Fried asked to see a copy of his indictment and then was granted a phone call with his US-based attorneys.  Bankman-Fried faces eight charges of conspiracy and fraud for his actions at FTX and private equity firm Alameda Research.  Updated at 5.45pm GMT    5.12pm    The European Union is accusing Meta of violating antitrust rules by \u201cdistorting competition in the markets for online classified ads\u201d, the European Commission said on Monday.  The commission said that it \u201ctakes issue with Meta tying its online classified ads service, Facebook Marketplace, to its personal social network, Facebook,\u201d it said in a statement. It is also accusing Meta of imposing unfair trading conditions to its competitors of Facebook marketplace.  The tie, it says, \u201cgives Facebook Marketplace a substantial distribution advantage that competitors cannot match\u201d.  The commission said its statement of objections to Meta is a \u201cpreliminary view\u201d after it opened an investigation into the company in June 2021 but does not prejudge the outcome of the investigation. It is unclear when the investigation will end as there is no legal deadline for an antitrust investigation.      4.46pm    US senator Elizabeth Warren sent a letter to the chair of Tesla\u2019s board of investors Robyn Denholm Sunday night saying Elon Musk may not be the fully dedicated CEO the company needs.  \u201cAs you know, it is the legal obligation of Tesla\u2019s board to ensure that its CEO is meeting all his legal responsibilities as an effective leader,\u201d Warren wrote, according to the New York Times.  Warren inquired whether Musk sending Tesla employees to work at Twitter \u2013 at least 50 Tesla employees were pulled into Twitter since Musk took over at the end of October \u2013 is harming the company. She also suggested that Musk could be using one company to benefit the other, for example charging Tesla more for ads or readjusting Twitter\u2019s algorithm to benefit Tesla, what could be antitrust violations.  \u201cThe problems identified in this letter are not merely theoretical,\u201d Warren wrote, noting that Tesla\u2019s stock has fallen as Musk conducted over his takeover of Twitter. She said there could be \u201csignificant legal questions\u201d about the relationship between the two companies in the future.       4.22pm    In a tweet on Epic Games settlement with the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC), the company\u2019s CEO Tim Sweeney said the settlements reflect how American regulatory practices are changing.  \u201cDevelopers should dig into the topic, as this settlement reflects state of the art American regulatory practice,\u201d Sweeney said.   While Epic Games is framing the settlement as a change in regulatory practices, the FTC says that the company knew the children were playing without parents\u2019 consent.  \u201cFirms cannot put growth and revenue over the safety and privacy of their users, especially children and teens,\u201d said FTC chair Lina Khan in a series of tweets. The company \u201cput children and teens at risk with privacy invasive default settings\u201d.  \u201cNotably, our complaint states that these default settings caused substantial harm and constituted \u2018unfair\u2019 practices against both kids and teens,\u201d she said.      3.55pm    Epic Games, which the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) just announced agreed to pay $520m in settlements over privacy law violations, released a statement on the settlement saying \u201cno developer creates a game with the intention of ending up here\u201d. \u201cThe video game industry is a place of fast-moving innovation, where player expectations are high and new ideas are paramount,\u201d the statement said. \u201cStatutes written decades ago don\u2019t specify how gaming ecosystems should operate. The laws have not changed, but their application has evolved and long-standing industry practices are no longer enough.\u201d \u201cWe accepted this agreement because we want Epic to be at the forefront of consumer protection and provide the best experience for our players,\u201d the company said.  Updated at 4.22pm GMT    3.31pm    This is Lauren Aratani in New York taking over. Epic Games, the creator of the popular video game Fortnite, is agreeing to pay the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) a total of $520m for two settlements after violating children\u2019s privacy law, the FTC announced this morning.  The agency said the video game maker \u201cdeployed design tricks, known as dark patterns, to dupe millions of players into making unintentional purchases.\u201d The company is agreeing to pay two settlements: $275m for violating the agency\u2019s Children\u2019s Online Privacy Protection Act, which bans companies from disclosing, collecting or using information from children under 13 and $245m as a refund to consumers for \u201cits dark patterns and billing practices\u201d. The FTC said the settlements are the largest monetary penalty for violating the privacy protection act and the largest refund in a gaming case.  \u201cEpic used privacy-invasive default settings and deceptive interfaces that tricked Fortnite users, including teenagers and children,\u201d FTC chair Lina Khan said in a statement. \u201cProtecting the public, and especially children, from online privacy invasions and dark patterns is a top priority for the commission.\u201d  Fortnite gained popularity in 2018, generating Epic Games $9bn in the game\u2019s first two years of existence.       3.11pm    Wall Street has been trading for about half an hour, and Tesla shares have enjoyed a small bump. The carmaker\u2019s value was up by 1.7% at the time of writing at $152.72 \u2013 less than the 4.5% move at one point in pre-open trading.  Of course, that does not make up for the large losses endured by shareholders this year, but with a stock of this size it does mean a $5bn gain \u2013 Musk\u2019s 13% shareholding would equate to about $650m in paper valuation. That would not be a bad return for most Twitter polls.      2.44pm     Former Meta chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg and Nextdoor boss Sarah Friar would make for good candidates to lead Twitter, says the Financial Times\u2019s Lex column. Sandberg announced her resignation from Facebook in June, after transforming it into one of the biggest advertising companies in the world. She was seen as an \u201cadult in the room\u201d beside founder Mark Zuckerberg. Perhaps the same steadying hand could help at Elon Musk\u2019s company. Friar was previously finance boss at Square, the payments company set up by Twitter founder Jack Dorsey, so the FT (\u00a3) reckons she could help with Musk\u2019s aims for Twitter to become a \u201csuperapp\u201d offering payments, among other things. A rare Northern Irish (she\u2019s from County Tyrone, if you\u2019re asking) transplant to California, she also has Goldman Sachs, McKinsey, and the universities of Oxford and Stanford on her CV. There is also a sting in the tail of the FT\u2019s piece: it reckons that Twitter\u2019s valuation is only just over a third of what Musk and his backers actually paid. That is value destruction to rival Tesla during 2022.  Valued at about three times trailing revenue (equal to similar-sized peer Snap), Twitter\u2019s enterprise value would now be just $15bn.      2.06pm    So who is likely to take over from Musk as CEO of Twitter?  TechCrunch editor at large Mike Butcher says it\u2019s likely to be someone quite \u201ccommercially minded\u201d from Silicon Valley that can put Twitter on an \u201ceven keel.\u201d  Butcher says no one thought Musk was going to stay in the job forever, and was likely under pressure from Tesla\u2019s board, who have watched shares plunge following a string of controversies linked to his takeover of Twitter.  He said it\u2019s very likely that Musk will leave, it\u2019s just a matter of when.       1.48pm    Mike Butcher, editor at large at TechCrunch, tells Sky News that it\u2019s very likely that Musk had a plan already in place before he issuing the Twitter poll.   Elon Musk is very mercurial so it\u2019s very hard to tell whether or not he\u2019ll actually abide by the poll, but it\u2019s more likely that he already had a plan ahead of doing that poll.  It\u2019s not quite clear what that plan is exactly, but Butcher notes that Musk issued the Tweet after landing in Qatar for the World Cup final. He says Musk \u201cmost certainly\u201d had talks with investors, given he has backers in the region who helped him take over Twitter in the first place.  One thing you can be sure of its that he\u2019ll do whatever he wants\u2026whether he\u2019s said one thing earlier or not. It\u2019s as simple as that. So we\u2019ll have to wait and see.  In terms of current management teams, Butcher notes that Musk is surrounded by people who \u201cdo his bidding\u201d and that there is no longer a board to really speak of. \u201cSo it\u2019s really down to one man, pretty much all of it\u201d. The staff themselves have had to figure out what Twitter should be doing via his tweets rather than through any internal communications, as might normally happen inside any \u201cnormal company\u201d It\u2019s been a \u201ctotally chaotic period under Musk\u2019s leadership\u201d, Butcher adds.  Updated at 1.56pm GMT    1.00pm   Union cautions Musk still Twitter owner even if he steps down as CEO  A union which represents some of Twitter\u2019s UK staff says that even if Musk does honour the poll and steps down as CEO, the social media firm\u2019s strategy is unlikely to change given he still owns the company.  Furthermore, the way Musk hinged his decision on the outcome of an online poll is yet another sign of the \u201cdeep issues\u201d plaguing the company under his watch, according to the Prospect union\u2019s general secretary Mike Clancy.  Clancy said in a statement:   This latest erratic behaviour by Elon Musk, once again underlines the deep issues over the way this company is being run. Whether or not Musk carries through on this vote, and is the chief executive going forward, he will still own the business. This means it seems highly doubtful that we will see a sea change in strategy. The way that Twitter under Musk has treated its staff has been appalling, riding roughshod over the principles that underpin UK employment law. What is needed is a fundamental change in approach, rather than more attention seeking, knee jerk decision making.   Updated at 4.23pm GMT    12.36pm    In case Musk is on the hunt for a replacement, Snoop Dog had issued his own tongue-in-cheek poll and asking his own followers whether the rapper should replace the Tesla boss as head of Twitter:       12.09pm    More than 10 million people voted in favour of Elon Musk stepping down as chief executive of Twitter in a poll he posted on the site late on Sunday. The billionaire, who bought the company and installed himself as its head just 50 days ago, has insisted there is no successor in the wings. \u201cNo one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive,\u201d he said on the social network. \u201cThere is no successor.\u201d Replying to another user who said they could do the job, Musk added \u201cyou must like pain a lot. One catch: you have to invest your life savings in Twitter and it has been in the fast lane to bankruptcy since May. Still want the job?\u201d Musk has a history of using Twitter polls to rubber-stamp major decisions, selling a tenth of his Tesla holdings after one poll in 2021, restoring Donald Trump\u2019s account after a second last month and reinstating a swath of suspended accounts following a third. \u201cVox Populi, Vox Dei\u201d, Musk tweeted after the Trump poll. You can read the full story \u2013 including details of the chaos surrounding account bans \u2013 here:      12.04pm     If Musk does follow through on his promise to \u201cabide by the results\u201d of the poll there is one group of people who would almost certainly be pleased: investors in Tesla. Musk\u2019s focus on the social network has come at a time when Tesla shares have been under enormous and sustained pressure. That has not been aided by Musk\u2019s need to sell Tesla shares worth billions to fund the Twitter deal. Tesla shares have gained 4.5% in pre-market trading on Monday to above $157 \u2013 up from just over $150 at Friday\u2019s close, according to data from Google. The value of the company had fallen by 50% to $470bn (\u00a3387bn) over the course of 2022. That is still enormous, but less than the $1 trillion valuation it achieved in October 2021. Rival carmakers are catching up with electric vehicles and there has also been a broader rout in tech shares as rising interest rates diminished the relative value of future earnings. The US stock market benchmark, the S&amp;P 500, fell by 16% over the same time period. Dan Ives, a tech analyst at Wedbush Securities, a US investment bank, said if Musk hands the reins of Twitter over it would be a \u201cmajor positive\u201d and allow Musk to stop the damage on Tesla. Ives has a price target of $250 for Tesla shares. \u201cTime to end this nightmare as CEO of Twitter,\u201d he said in a note sent to clients on Monday.  From the botched verification subscription plan to banning journalists to political firestorms caused on a daily basis [it has] been the perfect storm as advertisers have run for the hills and left Twitter squarely in the red ink potentially on track to lose roughly $4bn per year we estimate. More red ink means funding gaps causing Musk to sell more Tesla stock which has been used as his own personal ATM machine since this saga began in April. As such, this has been a black eye moment for Musk and been a major overhang on Tesla\u2019s stock which continues to suffer in a brutal way since the Twitter soap opera began with brand deterioration related to Musk a real issue. Musk is Tesla and Tesla is Musk. Attention focused on Twitter instead of golden child Tesla has been another big issue for investors and likely is behind this poll results with many Musk loyalists wanting him to leave as CEO of Twitter. With the poll closing this morning, it appears Musk\u2019s reign as CEO of Twitter will come to end and thus be a major positive for Tesla\u2019s stock starting to slowly remove this albatross from the story.      11.38am    All eyes will now be on Elon Musk\u2019s own Twitter account to hear what his next steps might be.  However, it is unclear when he will comment \u2013 not least because he may still be in the air. Musk\u2019s private jet took off from Doha about three hours ago, where he was watching the final of the football World Cup. *There is of course an irony in reporting on the movements of his jet: the source for these data is an automated social media account on Instagram called Elon Musk\u2019s Jet. Musk himself banned the Twitter version of the account, and several journalists covering his actions, after accusing them of \u201cdoxxing\u201d him by posting details of his whereabouts. He then reversed some of the bans a few days later.     11.21am   Twitter poll says Elon Musk should step down as chief executive  Confirmation: Elon Musk\u2019s Twitter poll says he should step down as chief executive of the social media company. There were 17,502,391 votes. 57.5% were in favour. 42.5% were against.  *This post has been updated. The total vote figure rose by about 200,000 following the closure of the poll.  Updated at 11.43am GMT    11.17am    With only about three minutes left, it looks very likely that Elon Musk\u2019s Twitter poll will say he should step down as chief executive. Twitter polls are hardly binding votes, but Musk does have a history of following through on them. It is unclear what Musk\u2019s plan is, given the lack of an obvious successor.  Musk himself spent Sunday in Qatar watching Argentina win the football world cup. Pictures from the stadium showed him standing beside Jared Kushner, the son-in-law of Donald Trump.  Trump, of course, used Twitter to his advantage during his US presidential run, and then started a rival social media company, Truth Social. Twitter briefly banned users from posting links to rival social media companies, including Truth Social and larger rivals such as Instagram and Facebook.     10.56am   Bank of England launches consultation on scrapping banker bonus cap  And as chancellor Jeremy Hunt prepares for a range of City reforms in a bit to spur growth, the Bank of England has launched the first of a raft of consultations: this time on the banker bonus cap. Plans to scrap the EU cap were first announced during the September mini-budget, paving the way for bankers to earn more than 200% of their salaries in bonuses.  However, recruiters and bankers are sceptical that it will spark much change here in the UK \u2013 where bankers have grown accustomed to higher fixed pay, which by and large rose to compensate for the bonus cap which came into force in 2014:  However, the Bank of England said as part of the consultation:   The proposed changes should\u2026help remove unintended consequences that have arisen as a result of the bonus cap, namely growth in the proportion of the fixed component of total remuneration, which reduces firms\u2019 ability to adjust costs to absorb losses in a downturn.       10.30am   Poll update: 57.6% so far vote for Musk to step down as Twitter boss  The proportion of Twitter users voting for Musk to resign as head of Twitter is climbing with 50 minutes left to go: Yes: 57.6% No: 42.4%     10.05am    In a written statement regarding the UK spring budget, chancellor Jeremy Hunt has said:  Today I can inform the House that I have asked the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) to prepare a forecast for 15March 2023 to accompany a spring budget. This forecast, in addition to the forecast that took place in November 2022, will fulfil the obligation for the OBR to produce at least two forecasts in a financial year, as is required by legislation.   Updated at 10.14am GMT    10.01am   BREAKING: UK spring budget to be held 15 March 2023  The chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, will deliver the spring budget on 15 March 2023, according to Reuters. And for the avoidance of any doubt (given the controversy that followed the lack of forecasts alongside the disastrous mini-budget delivered by ex-PM Liz Truss and her chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng) the Office for Budget Responsibility has been commissioned to prepare forecasts alongside the presentation, Reuters adds.  Updated at 10.15am GMT    9.51am    Call it Chekhov\u2019s Jet: a Twitter account placed on the mantelpiece in act one must surely go off in act five. Seven days after buying the social network he tweeted that his commitment to free speech extended even \u201cto not banning the account following my plane\u201d. Six weeks later, his reversal of that policy set in motion a series of events that seems increasingly likely to end in his dramatic departure as chief executive of Twitter. On Thursday, Musk banned the @ElonJet account, claiming to be spooked by an apparently unrelated altercation with a man who was stalking his ex-wife. On Friday, he suspended the accounts of a number of journalists who had reported on his move.  On Saturday, he suspended the account of Taylor Lorenz, a reporter at The Washington Post who had sent him a request for comment on the site, later claiming it was for \u201chistorical doxing offences\u201d: breaking a rule that hadn\u2019t existed when she broke it, with tweets that were no longer live on the site. On Sunday, he reinstated her account, before immediately banning her permanently, for breaking another newly created rule: a ban on any promotion of accounts on other social networks, a policy apparently instated in a hurry over the weekend in an attempt to stem the flow of users leaving the social network for sites not run at the whim of a vengeful billionaire. Like the old woman who swallowed the fly, each time Musk reacts to the problems he\u2019s caused, he creates bigger and bigger problems for himself. If his offer to step down is to be taken at face value, it would represent a rare moment of insight in his 50 days at the top of Twitter: the realisation that the only common cause of all of Musk\u2019s problems on social media are Musk himself.  Updated at 10.10am GMT    9.27am   Tesla shares rise as clock ticks on Musk's Twitter resignation poll  Telsa investors seem to pleased with the way that Musk\u2019s Twitter poll is leaning towards his potential resignation, with shares up 4% in pre-market trading:      9.17am    Economic data interlude:  The German Ifo business climate data for December shows confidence among the country\u2019s firms rose more than expected, despite the energy crisis and high inflation.  The index rose from 86.4 in November to 88.6 this month.  A Reuters poll of analysts had suggested the reading would be closer to 87.4.       9.12am   Musk poll: 57.4% so far voting in favour of his resignation as Twitter boss  A quick update on Musk\u2019s Twitter resignation poll, which has now attracted 15.8 million votes with just two hours left to go: Yes: 57.4% No: 42.6%  Updated at 9.32am GMT    9.00am    Victoria Scholar, head of investment at interactive investor, says Musk\u2019s Twitter controversies are compounding other issues for Tesla, which is already grappling with supply shortages and increased competition. Scholar explains:  The electric carmaker has been one of the worst performers in US tech this year, down by more than 60% following a meteoric surge for the stock of more than 1600% from the 2020 trough to the peak in 2021. Tesla has had the added pressure this year from Elon Musk\u2019s Twitter acquisition which has distracted the billionaire, taking his attention away from the EV giant. Even prior to the Twitter deal, Musk was already spreading himself very thinly with SpaceX, Neuralink, the Boring Company as well as Tesla.  It\u2019s also worth remembering that Musk used his Tesla shares to help fund his $44bn takeover of Twitter, which has also caused concern among investors.  Musk has been using Tesla stock to fund his Twitter deal by selling a total of $22.9bn worth of Tesla stock this year in another sign he is taking his eye off the ball and weighing on investor confidence. Tesla has had a series of headwinds to grapple with from growing competition in the EV space, the global chip shortage, problems with the global supply chain and the shift in investor preferences away from technology. Investors remain cautious towards technology in 2023 and Musk\u2019s Twitter distraction certainly doesn\u2019t help.   Updated at 9.00am GMT    8.39am   Tesla shares fall further in after-hours trading as Musk mulls future at Twitter  Shares in Tesla, the electric car company that is responsible for making Elon Musk one of the richest men in the world, continue to suffer in after-hours trading. The stock price is down a further 0.77%, adding to further pain for shareholders. Tesla shares having plunged more than 62% so far this year \u2013 a fall that is partly linked to the continued controversies related to Musk\u2019s forays into social media ownership.   Updated at 9.47am GMT    8.27am    A quick check in on European equity markets, where major indices are trading higher at the start of trading:   FTSE 100 is up 0.36%  FTSE 250 is up 0.2% Germany\u2019s Xetra Dax is up 0.68% France\u2019s Cac 40 is up 0.7%  Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB is up 0.6%      8.11am   Analyst: Twitter has been a \"black eye\" for Tesla  Dan Ives, a managing director of equity research at US investment firm Wedbush Securities, says Musk\u2019s willingness to step back may be linked to the fact that controversies linked to Twitter have started to damage his \u201cgolden child\u201d: Tesla.  Ives told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme this morning that while Musk has not necessarily followed through with the decisive calls of Twitter polls in the past, this time is different:  The last few weeks, few months, [have] been a black eye for Musk and a black eye for Tesla, and I think ultimately that\u2019s the golden child: that 90% plus of his wealth. And that\u2019s why I think the writings on the wall, and I think ultimately in the next 24 hours, Musk will probably name a temporary CEO of Twitter.  Ives said it\u2019s clear that Musk needs to stick to his strengths:  He can build rockets and create electric cars. That\u2019s why he is who he is. But when it comes to social media and to Twitter, I think this is a diff type of animal, and he\u2019s realised he can\u2019t balance this as well as Tesla and Space X. And I think the writing\u2019s on the wall that he cannot be CEO of Twitter.  And as for how quickly we could see changes enacted, Ives reckons the executive overhaul could be triggered within hours.  I think the pressure was building, I think ultimately, probably in the next 5-6 hours, it\u2019s going to be the end of Musk reigning as CEO of Twitter.   Updated at 9.47am GMT    7.52am    Full story: Musk sets up Twitter poll asking if he should step down as head Elon Musk has asked Twitter users whether he should step down as the head of the company, promising to abide by the results of his poll. Musk assumed the role of CEO at the end of October after firing a host of senior executives and dissolving its board of directors. Within minutes of posting the poll, more than 1 million people had voted. After 20 minutes of polling, when the yes vote gained a double-digit lead, Musk responded to a suggestion that he had already picked a new CEO, saying: \u201cNo one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor.\u201d   Updated at 9.48am GMT    7.44am   Introduction: Elon Musk pledges to honour poll over his potential resignation as Twitter CEO  Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the economy, business and the financial markets. Less than two months after Elon Musk controversially bought Twitter for $44m and installed himself as CEO of the company, he is putting his fate in the hands of its users. Following a string of controversies over layoffs, new posting policies and temporary journalist bans, the billionaire issued a Twitter poll in the early hours of Monday morning, asking users \u201cShould I step down as head of Twitter? I will abide by the results of this poll\u201d  As of the time of writing, the poll had already attracted more than 14 million votes, with around 57% voting for his resignation. The poll is set to close around 11am GMT, though it is not clear how quickly Musk would step down if the majority of voters call for his ousting. It is also unclear who would replace Musk as chief executive. He said in a separate tweet, Musk said: \u201cNo one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor.\u201d  Meanwhile, it\u2019s relatively quiet on the economics front in the lead up to the Christmas weekend, with the CBI industrial trends survey for December due later this morning.

                    "body": "Good morning. You may know nuclear fusion as the power source for Iron Man\u2019s suit, or the basis of the Mr Fusion Home Energy Reactor that powers the, er, flux capacitor in Back to the Future. (If so, please stop reading, this is not a newsletter for nerds.) Yesterday, after the news was initially reported by the Financial Times, Joe Biden\u2019s energy secretary, Jennifer Granholm, confirmed a scientific breakthrough at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California that\u2019s a very long way from a superhero exoskeleton or a souped-up DeLorean: for the first time, a fusion reaction has produced more energy than it takes in. Which sounds miles better than a time machine, to be honest. Granholm called it \u201cone of the most impressive scientific feats of the 21st century\u201d. In theory, nuclear fusion reactors could one day be a plentiful source of power without any associated carbon emissions or radioactive waste. Climate crisis solved, and we can all get back to obsessing over Harry and Meghan on Netflix instead. Disappointingly, though, it isn\u2019t anything like that simple. Today\u2019s Grinch-like (but also very interesting!) newsletter, with Dr Michael Bluck, director of the Centre for Nuclear Engineering at Imperial College London, is about the long distance from a remarkable breakthrough to an energy utopia \u2013 and why fusion won\u2019t help us get to net zero. Here are the headlines. Five big stories  Asylum | Rishi Sunak has insisted he can clear a backlog of nearly 100,000 asylum claims by the end of next year as part of a five-point plan that includes changes to the law that will criminalise and then remove tens of thousands of people who claimed asylum after travelling to the UK by small boats. Strikes | The standoff between UK ministers, bosses and unions over pay showed no sign of reaching resolution on the first day of four weeks of planned industrial action. Rishi Sunak said that the government would not shift its position on pay ahead of another day of disrupted trains on Wednesday. Strep A | The cost of antibiotics used to strep A have risen more than tenfold in the UK in recent weeks, pharmacists have said, with many facing continued difficulties in sourcing supplies. Since mid-September there had been 60 deaths from invasive strep A infections in England, including 13 children. Plastics | Single-use plastic items including cutlery, plates and polystyrene cups are reportedly to be banned in England by the UK government after a consultation. Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Coffey, the environment secretary, is poised to unveil plans to phase out the items and replace them with biodegradable alternatives. Media | Harry &amp; Meghan, Netflix\u2019s documentary series about Britain\u2019s Prince Harry and his wife, racked up more viewing time on the streaming service than any other documentary during its first week, the company said. More than 28m households watched at least part of the series.  In depth: \u2018Predicting the future is difficult \u2013 there are huge hurdles to overcome\u2019  Before we get into the reservations, Dr Michael Bluck wants to be clear about something: the success of the US government\u2019s National Ignition Facility (NIF) in California in producing a net energy gain from a fusion reaction for the first time is remarkable. \u201cThis is a very impressive scientific achievement \u2013 it\u2019s a really, really hard thing to do,\u201d he said. Ever since the 1950s, scientists have sought to realise the theoretical promise of the same reaction that occurs in the core of the sun. But the old joke about fusion suggests how difficult that has been: it is always, always 30 years away. \u201cThese are very bright people doing amazing things,\u201d Bluck said. \u201cIt is a sort of holy grail.\u201d *** What is nuclear fusion? Whereas nuclear fission \u2013 the process at work in conventional nuclear power plants \u2013 generates energy by splitting heavy atoms like uranium, fusion works the other way round. A thermonuclear reaction fuses light elements like hydrogen into heavier ones like helium, thereby generating more energy than it takes to produce. (Nicola Davis explains this in more detail.) That process is known as \u201cignition\u201d. Beyond the obvious virtue of a net energy yield, \u201cIt\u2019s low carbon, it offers baseload [that is, consistent] energy unlike renewables at the moment, and you don\u2019t have to worry about it melting down or producing nuclear waste to the same extent,\u201d Bluck said. \u201cIt\u2019s a great vision.\u201d *** What does this announcement mean? There are two approaches to nuclear fusion: call them doughnuts v lasers. Magnetic confinement is the more common and longstanding method: picture, if you can, a doughnut-shaped machine, with nuclear fuel inside it kept afloat by magnetic fields and heated to incredible temperatures while the reaction takes place. The NIF is one of a smaller number of facilities trying something different: inertial confinement. In the pithy summary of White House science chief, Arati Prabhakar, yesterday: \u201cThey shot a bunch of lasers at a pellet of fuel [hydrogen plasma] and more energy was released from that fusion ignition than the energy of the lasers.\u201d The pellet, encased in diamond, sits in a tiny gold cylinder. By hitting it with 192 giant lasers for less than 100 trillionths of a second at more than 3 million celsius, scientists at NIF succeeded in producing 3 megajoules of energy from the 2.05 megajoules it took to make the reaction happen. But as good as that sounds, there are very significant barriers to further progress. \u201cIt\u2019s important to say that this is not trying to be a fusion reactor, it\u2019s simply trying to make fusion happen,\u201d said Bluck. \u201cBut it lacks almost everything that you need to make a viable reactor. \u201cSo, OK, the energy put in has resulted in a larger amount of energy coming out \u2013 but the big caveat is that it depends where you draw your perimeter: powering the lasers themselves required way more energy. You have to draw a slightly artificial dotted line around the vessel to say there\u2019s been a gain.\u201d The lasers may emit 2.05 megajoules, but they took about 500 megajoules of energy to power, though defenders of the experiment say that they are not optimally efficient and can be significantly improved. \u201cThere\u2019s also the fact that you would need the reaction to happen much more often,\u201d he went on. At the moment, the NIF manages it about ten times a week. \u201cYou need it many times a second.\u201d As well as all that, the energy produced in the NIF experiment is in the form of \u201chigh speed neutrons, X-rays, gamma rays, radiant heating \u2013 none of that is any use to us in and of itself. We\u2019ve got to convert it to stuff that can do work.\u201d That\u2019s very difficult to do without overheating the lasers that make the reaction happen in the first place. \u201cAnd that programme of work has not even been thought about yet.\u201d Magnetic confinement \u2013 the doughnut option \u2013 may not have reached the more-out-than-in milestone yet. \u201cBut they have been thinking about the real world stuff for many years. They\u2019ve sort of\u201d \u2013 you can hear the pain of this simplification in Bluck\u2019s voice as he speaks \u2013 \u201csolved the physics issues, and now they\u2019re looking squarely at the engineering issues.\u201d *** So does this news mean nuclear fusion plants are closer?  Again, sort of: something with a proven concept is closer than something without one. (Arthur Turrell argues for the importance of that step.) Yesterday, Jennifer Granholm said that Joe Biden had set a target of \u201ca commercial fusion reactor within 10 years\u201d. What\u2019s possible? \u201cPredicting the future is difficult,\u201d allowed Bluck. \u201cBut I think I\u2019m being optimistic in saying 50 years for inertial confinement being in practical use \u2013 it\u2019s between 50 years and never. There are huge hurdles to overcome.\u201d Kim Budil of the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory said yesterday that \u201ca few decades of research on the underlying technologies could put us in a position to build a power plant\u201d. Could magnetic confinement work sooner? \u201cI think that\u2019s ambitious, too,\u201d said Bluck. \u201cA demonstrator by 2050 \u2013 OK, that could be possible. But that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s cost effective to scale up.\u201d *** But can it help reach net zero? Some advocates of fusion would say that Bluck is being too pessimistic \u2013 but even in best case scenarios, it is hard to see fusion as a useful part of the changes needed to make net zero a reality. It is cumulative emissions that matter to avoiding the worst impact of the climate crisis, and so even if fusion plants are online at scale by 2050, that is too late. Nonetheless, investors in fusion \u2013 like Jeff Bezos and Peter Thiel \u2013 are persuaded of its revolutionary potential. \u201cThere is a degree of utopian zeal,\u201d said Bluck. \u201cYou\u2019re not a billionaire worthy of the name unless you\u2019re investing in ambitious devices. What it will mean for getting to net zero by 2050 is realistically nothing. I do worry sometimes that it can suck the air out of other more viable solutions.\u201d *** So is there any point in pursuing fusion power? Absolutely! For one thing, Bluck might be wrong: \u201cThere might be that significant step forwards that changes things suddenly. But we should be careful not to overestimate that possibility.\u201d Still, nuclear fusion doesn\u2019t have to be about solving the climate crisis to be worthwhile. The more realistic role for fusion, Thomas Nicholas writes in this 2019 piece for the Conversation, is \u201cas an energy source in a post carbon society\u201d. And so long as it doesn\u2019t become an excuse for ignoring the urgency of the only realistic solution to the climate crisis, a rapid transition to renewables, it\u2019s not like it presents much competition for funding: the total investment in private companies working on fusion ever is about $4.8bn, the Fusion Industry Association says. In comparison, clean energy investment in 2022 totalled $1.4tn, of which $472bn went on renewable power. \u201cNone of this means fusion doesn\u2019t have potential,\u201d Bluck said. \u201cBut you have to be able to say what you\u2019re going to do in between.\u201d Pondering the holy grail, he added: \u201cI don\u2019t think they ever found it, did they?\u201d What else we\u2019ve been reading  Andrew Gregory and Denis Campbell spent 33 hours in an NHS hospital, and their findings unveiled just how deep the crisis in the health service has gotten.

                    "body": "When I was younger the phrases around work were largely of the \u201cYou Don\u2019t Have To Be Mad To Work Here\u201d variety. Office humour is a hell of a drug. \u201cSARCASM is one of the free services I offer\u201d propped on a desk alongside a family of gonks and three cooling coffees. \u201cWhen you EXCEL they always SPREADSHEET about you.\u201d It was good stuff! It kept us going through the dark days of the mid-2000s, before the world as we know it emerged, with its sickness and crop tops, and endless milks. And before work became so complicated and so changeable we were required to create whole new phrases and grammar to try to explain it. The latest is \u201cquiet hiring\u201d \u2013 when employers ask workers to shift their roles rather than employ new staff, which is the younger sibling of \u201cquiet quitting\u201d \u2013 doing the minimum your job requires. That\u2019s another one, a phrase built to help us re-conceptualise the ways we\u2019re forced to work, especially since the pandemic, which slowly wrung out the last possibilities of joy from work\u2019s withered flannel. My colleagues and I are currently working from home, or \u201cWFH\u201d (along with the new phrases came a file of correct pronunciations, and this, I can tell you, is pronounced like a dog sneezing), which means this month we have missed two deskmates\u2019 birthdays, and so, two cakes. You may have heard by now that Professor Susan Jebb, chairwoman of the Food Standards Agency, recently announced that bringing birthday cakes to work should be considered as socially unacceptable as passive smoking. It was, admittedly, an odd news story \u2013 the Times seems to have set up its own commission, where knowledgable people like Jebb contributed ideas about health in a nuanced way, and then the paper reported it with a shocked headline as if she was launching a culture war to ban our biscuits. But still. Battle lines were drawn.  Who was this woman and why was she coming for our cakes, cried the internet, our cakes, the final flake of pleasure us flailing workers had left! Cakes should not be banned, people suggested \u2013 colleagues who say, \u201cOh, I shouldn\u2019t,\u201d when offered a piece should, or \u201cI\u2019m off sugar.\u201d Love letters to Colin the Caterpillar \u2013 his moist chocolate loins, the transgressive pleasure of biting into an eyeball \u2013 sat alongside essays on how Jebb\u2019s suggestion was another example of wokeness gone mad. Me, I loved it all. I mean, I scoffed, of course I did. A slice of cake around the printer is unlikely to have any health risks for the majority of us. Even two. Even two, eaten using a magazine as a plate and a ballpoint pen as a knife. Because a thousand things decide whether or not a person will become obese, quite aside from their willpower around dessert \u2013 it\u2019s a confused and confusing combination of age, metabolism, mental health, medications, genetics, class and money that decides the state of a body. But, as usual, the messaging has been simplified and scrubbed until it\u2019s so flimsy it appears like this, as a sharp-nailed swipe at office cake. That\u2019s part of the reason I remain on the side of cake. The other became clear when curled with my daughter watching the new series of Junior Bake Off, where child bakers were tasked with making cakes that illustrated something they would prioritise if they were prime minister. One boy made a cake that called for neurodiversity to be better understood, another made a bed, symbolising his policy to end homelessness. It was equal parts adorable and upsetting, these genius kids, able to both make a quite delicious-looking little sponge and quickly describe the thing that adults were failing at; the thing which kept them up at night. They were judged on their bakes, but the real judgment was on us, the old and voting public, who continue to let down our children with bad choices and fear. I thought about cake as a symbol and I thought about work. It feels clear to me that the meaning of all these new phrases about work, like \u201cquiet hiring\u201d, are less important than the fact we feel a need to create and update the language at all. They\u2019re a record of how we are struggling to understand the changing landscape of work and trying to make it all right in our minds. And in the same way, this debate about office cake misses the point. Four o\u2019clock, the jangle of awkward song, the heaving oneself up to marvel at a traybake \u2013 it\u2019s about taking a pause in the day for a tiny celebration, acknowledging a life outside work, one where we were once kids and birthdays were important, and forcing a moment of human connection across a Victoria sponge. A plate of supermarket cupcakes, icing so thick it briefly paralyses your teeth, a round of under-brewed tea, a Twix bought as an in-joke and one unexplained Revel on a tray. Susan Jebb, my friend, these are the things of life! And to my sweet-toothed comrades, still toiling through the discourse, this argument about cake\u2026 it\u2019s not about cake at all.

                    "body": "Last week it was Gareth Bale who was the subject of great adulation, in these parts at least, but this was a night that belonged to his longstanding sidekick Wayne Hennessey. On an evening when Hennessey became the third Welshman to reach 100 caps for his country, a youngster at the other end of his career, Rubin Colwill, scored his first senior goal to cancel out Tomas Soucek\u2019s opener for the Czech Republic.  Bale arrived from the bench for the final nine minutes and forced a fine save from an awkward angle but it is fair to say he has ample credit in the bank. It was always going to be impossible for this friendly to live up to anything remotely close to the joyous scenes here six days ago, when Bale\u2019s double put Wales within a game of a first World Cup since 1958, but while the concourses were empty by comparison, a lively draw was played at an engaging pace in front of a crowd that departed with Friday\u2019s draw in Qatar at the forefront of their minds. Brennan Johnson was particularly lively and came close to notching a winner. A visibly emotional Hennessey was withdrawn to a warm ovation after an hour and after departing the pitch he made his way along the home dugout, shaking hands with backroom staff and substitutes. At the end of a long line Bale was waiting to give him a bear hug. He was never going to miss Hennessey\u2019s special occasion. The pair have become best friends since meeting on Wales Under-21s duty and both described their close relationship as a \u201cbromance\u201d in the buildup to this game. At full time Bale was quick to push the goalkeeper in front of the Canton Stand to ensure he basked in his achievement. \u201cIt was really nice for the supporters at the end to show their appreciation,\u201d the interim Wales manager, Robert Page, said. \u201cHe is an absolute legend and deserves all the plaudits he is going to get. His best mate, Baleo, made sure that a fuss was made of him and it was an honour to be part of it as well. \u201cBaleo wanted to be involved on his best mate\u2019s big moment. It was vice-versa when he got his [Bale celebrated 100 caps in November], and Gunts [Chris Gunter, last March].\u201d  Page said he would be \u201clike every other Welsh supporter out there watching the draw\u201d with a playoff final against either Scotland or Ukraine primed for June. Page made wholesale changes \u2013 Hennessey was the only player to keep his place from Thursday\u2019s victory over Austria \u2013 but the system remained the same, Johnson and Rabbi Matondo playing either side of Colwill, the teenage Cardiff forward. Aaron Ramsey was omitted from the squad altogether and Ben Davies was absent after returning to Tottenham as a precaution. \u201cWe have to show respect to their clubs,\u201d Page said. \u201cThe most important game was against Austria. Job done. We didn\u2019t need to risk Aaron. I made that decision not to have him and Joe Allen in the 23 [-man squad].\u201d Before kick-off Hennessey was presented with a gold cap and a commemorative award pitchside by his childhood hero, Neville Southall, and the Football Association of Wales president, Steve Williams. Beyond Hennessey\u2019s special occasion, the game also raised funds for the Disasters Emergency Committee to help Ukraine, with the team making a donation and any FAW profits from staging the game will go towards the humanitarian appeal. If the thought of Wales rousing themselves after Austria felt ambitious, this was probably the last trip the Czech Republic wanted, days on from losing their World Cup playoff semi-final in Sweden.  Hennessey\u2019s first start for Wales came against the same opposition, across town at the Millennium Stadium in 2007, against a team spearheaded by Milan Baros and Jan Koller, and he made a smart save here before the visitors opened the scoring. Onrej Lingr was first to Jaroslav Zeleny\u2019s cross and an alert Soucek smacked the loose ball home from near to the penalty spot. Johnson was electric down the right flank and twice went close to nudging Wales in front in the second half. It was no surprise the Nottingham Forest forward laid on Wales\u2019s leveller two minutes after Soucek struck. Johnson latched on to Gunter\u2019s floated pass, eased past Tomas Petrasek and cut the ball back for Colwill to expertly sweep into the corner. \u201cThe problem we have is keeping up with him,\u201d Page said of Johnson. \u201cBrennan has a great future in front of him.\u201d"

                    "body": "Eddie Howe has defended his decision to make wholesale changes to his side for Newcastle United\u2019s shock FA Cup third round defeat at Sheffield Wednesday on Saturday night, explaining that fatigue played its part. With half an eye on Tuesday\u2019s home Carabao Cup quarter-final against Leicester, Howe made eight changes to the team which had earned a draw at Arsenal on Tuesday. But the decision backfired when Josh Windass\u2019s second-half double ended Newcastle\u2019s 15-game unbeaten run and sent them out of the competition to League One opponents for the second consecutive season.  \u201cI think you pick it looking ahead at future games of course,\u201d Howe said. \u201cWe have a very quick turnaround, a late kick-off today, and I felt I saw some fatigue in the Arsenal performance. \u201cThe lads gave everything and I felt it would have been unwise of me to pick the same team for this game and for Leicester as well. I am not sure the lads were physically able to give it their best if I did that. Hence the changes.\u201d Howe left the regular starters Fabian Sch\u00e4r and Callum Wilson on Tyneside, while Kieran Trippier, Bruno Guimar\u00e3es \u2013 who came off the bench to halve the deficit with 21 minutes remaining \u2013 Miguel Almir\u00f3n and Joe Willock were all introduced as second-half substitutes. That meant opportunities for the fringe players Jamaal Lascelles, Elliot Anderson, Matt Ritchie and Jacob Murphy. Howe felt the results of those changes were mixed. \u201cWe\u2019re aware that we don\u2019t have the deepest squad in the Premier League,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are light on numbers but we feel high on quality. Injuries will dictate how stretched you feel. We had an opportunity to play a lot of players that haven\u2019t played a lot of minutes this season. I thought there were some positives and negatives within their performances. But I think it\u2019s probably better that I analyse that in the cold light of day.\u201d One positive for Newcastle was the return of Alexander Isak. The club\u2019s record signing has been out since picking up an injury while on international duty with Sweden in September. But the striker enjoyed a lively 45-minute appearance that would have been marked by a goal but for a pair of saves by Cameron Dawson.  Howe confirmed that the plan was always for Isak to be withdrawn at the interval, while also explaining that Allan Saint-Maximin was due to start the game only to pull out after Friday\u2019s training session through illness. \u201cIt was a huge disappointment that he missed out,\u201d said Howe. \u201cWe hope to get Maxi back to full fitness because he\u2019s a gamechanger, a match-winner. With him in the team tonight, the result is potentially different.\u201d Sheffield Wednesday\u2019s manager, Darren Moore, said: \u201cTonight was special. Eddie is doing a great job there so to beat them in the form they\u2019ve been in, it makes it a special night. We need to savour the moment.\u201d"

                    "body": "\u201cI saw a stat that Luka Modric has played in around 42% of all Croatia\u2019s international games. On quick research, I found one player who can beat that (Fatos Beciraj of Montenegro at 67.5%  but is there anyone else who has played in an even higher percentage of their nation\u2019s games?\u201d asks Richard Wilson. Let\u2019s start with a bit of housekee \u2026 wait, come back! There are so many different statistical resources on the internet, and a dispiritingly small number of them agree on, for example, how many games Gibraltar have played (belated spoiler alert!). So in the name of consistency we\u2019ve taken the relevant data from RSSSF.com, adding this week\u2019s games and cross-checking with the equally comprehensive eu-football.info. Our first port of call is a principality in the eastern Pyrenees. \u201cIldefons Lima has played in 70.7% of Andorra\u2019s games (133 of 188) ,\u201d writes James Turley. \u201cHe played at Wembley last year, aged 41, and hasn\u2019t retired yet so that figure could yet inch higher.\u201d Dara O\u2019Reilly has the names of a couple of Kosovans. \u201cSince their accession to Fifa in 2014, Kosovo have played 62 recognised international matches,\u201d writes Dara. \u201cTorino\u2019s Mergim Vojvoda have featured in 45 of them, while another Serie A stopper, Napoli\u2019s Amir Rrahmani, has played 44. That\u2019s 72.9% and 71%, respectively.\u201d  There are a few candidates in the Gibraltar team, as mentioned by David Ekstrand and Ben Blatch-Hanlon among others. Gibraltar have played 66 full internationals, of which Liam Walker has appeared in 59 (or 89.4%), Roy Chipolina 57 (86.4%) and Joseph Chipolina 47 (71.2%).  Gibraltar\u2019s stats will change over time but Saarland\u2019s are probably set in stone. \u201cSaarland was a French protectorate partitioned from Germany after the second world war,\u201d notes Phil Mollicone. \u201cBefore rejoining the Federal Republic of Germany in 1957, Saarland played 19 internationals. Of those, the defender Waldemar Philippi played 18, or 94.7%.\u201d It\u2019s worth mentioning a couple of other Saarland players: Herbert Martin won 17 caps, playing in 89.5% of games, and Gerhard Siedl 16 (or 84.2%). Philippi\u2019s record is pretty impressive, but we may have found a man who played in 100% of his country\u2019s games. Stuart Fryer points out that the Dutch East Indies \u2013 a colony that later became Indonesia \u2013 played five official internationals in the 1930s, including one match at the 1938 World Cup. \u201cI haven\u2019t been able to find the team for their final game, a friendly against the Netherlands,\u201d notes Stuart, \u201cbut the majority of the squad played in at least three of their five competitive games, and one, Hong Dien, played in at least four of their five games.\u201d According to RSSSF, Hong Dien (or THE Hong Djien as they call him) appeared in that final game, which makes it five out of five. And if you\u2019re not satisfied by that, there\u2019s a more modern example. Navin Patel points out that the Gibraltar women\u2019s team includes six players who have appeared in all six of their internationals: Kyrelle Revagliatte, Tiffany Viagas, Reighann Mascarenhas-Olivero, Naomi Victor, Joelle Gilbert and Shania Robba. Neighbours across borders (2) In last week\u2019s Knowledge we looked at neighbouring football clubs in different countries. And there are loads more, so many that we\u2019re going to present them without comment and in no particular order \u2026 \u201cCarlisle United in Cumbria are just 19 miles from Annan Athletic in Scottish League Two. Even closer from Carlisle are Gretna, who play in the Scottish Lowland League,\u201d writes Peter Hunt.  \u201cDundalk FC in the League of Ireland Premier Division (ground \u2013 Oriel Park) and Warrenpoint Town FC (ground \u2013 Milltown) in the Northern Ireland Football Premier Division are 35km apart by road but only 16km as the crow flies,\u201d suggests Paul Callan. Also: \u201cIt\u2019s only 16 miles between Oriel Park and Newry City\u2019s ground,\u201d adds Johnny Turner. Paul has another: \u201cDerry City FC (ground: The Ryan McBride Brandywell Stadium) and Finn Harps FC (ground: Finn Park, Ballybofey, Co. Donegal) both play in the Premier Division of the League of Ireland (although Derry City is in N. Ireland) and are 40km apart by road.\u201d \u201cThe distance between Ju\u00e1rez\u2019s Estadio Ol\u00edmpico Benito Ju\u00e1rez and El Paso Locomotive\u2019s Southwest University Park is just 1.5 miles/2.4km,\u201d points out Liam Searle, \u201cthough in reality it\u2019d take an hour to walk.\u201d \u201cSan Diego Loyal SC (playing in USL, second division in the USA) and Club Tijuana (playing in Liga MX, first division in Mexico),\u201d begins Kevin McAllister. \u201cThe distance from Torero Stadium in San Diego to Caliente Stadium in Tijuana is 25 miles.\u201d  \u201cLaredo Heat SC in Texas and Nuevo Laredo Bravos CF across the Rio Grande river in Mexico,\u201d suggests Eddie Bellion, a retired Fifa referee. \u201cProbably not much more than 10 miles between them.\u201d \u201cDetroit City Football Club and Windsor TFC in Ontario, Canada,\u201d begins Mike Ruddy. \u201cAccording to Google Maps, the teams\u2019 stadiums are 9.5 miles apart, whether crossing the Detroit River by bridge or tunnel.\u201d \u201cDo not forget Gibraltar\u2019s Victoria stadium, where all club teams in Gibraltar play,\u201d shouts Nick Corea. \u201cIt is located less than 1.5km from Estadio Municipal de La L\u00ednea de la Concepci\u00f3n, where Spanish third division (sort of, it gets complicated after Segunda; ask Sid Lowe) side Real Balomp\u00e9dica Linense play. They\u2019re probably the closest stadiums in different countries to host international matches, with Gibraltar playing at Victoria and two nations, Spain and Andorra, hosting in La L\u00ednea.\u201d \u201cI\u2019d like to nominate FC Helsing\u00f8r and Helsingborgs IF,\u201d nominates William Jansen. \u201cHelsing\u00f8r are leading the second tier in Denmark and Helsingborgs IF were just promoted to the Swedish top flight. Helsing\u00f8r is just 5km from Helsingborg. The teams play an annual pre-season friendly known as \u2018The \u00d8resund Derby\u2019 (named after the strait between the countries).\u201d \u201cHow about KFC Kom\u00e1rno in the Slovak Second Division and Kom\u00e1romi VSE in the Hungarian Third (West)?\u201d muses Peterjon Cresswell. \u201cThey represent Kom\u00e1rno and Kom\u00e1rom, actually one town until a century ago. Now they\u2019re divided by the Danube and a border running down the middle of it. Unfortunately, the Gods of football decree that although the opposing neighbours are only 1.5km apart, the grounds are 19km as KFC play in Hurbanovo just outside Kom\u00e1rno.\u201d \u201cND Gorica of Slovenia play in \u0160portni Park Nova Gorica in Nova Gorica,\u201d mails Tim Dockery. \u201cAcross the border in Italy are AS Pro Gorizia, who play at the Stadio Campagnuzza. According to Google Maps, the distance between the two stadiums as the crow flies is 2.15 km, but on foot it would be 2.8km.\u201d  Tim has another example from South America. \u201cMonumental Rio Parapit\u00ed is the fifth largest stadium in Paraguay and hosted a number of games at the 1999 Copa Am\u00e9rica. It is also the home of Club 2 de Mayo of Paraguay\u2019s second tier. Across the avenue in Brazil, is the Estadio Municipal Aral Moreira, home to SE Pontaporanense. The distance between the two stadiums is 2.3km as the crow flies, but 2.5km if you were to walk.\u201d \u201cNice and Monaco, grounds 20km apart across an international border,\u201d writes Charles of the Ligue 1 sides. \u201cWrexham obviously play in the English system but there are a plethora of Welsh Premier League teams around them,\u201d reports Micky Smith. \u201cThe closest is Gresford Athletic, who play in Cymru North (second tier) at a mere 5.7km door to door.\u201d \u201cIs it worth throwing in The New Saints (Welsh Premier League and regular participants in European football) and St Martins (NWCL Division 1 South for now)?\u201d asks Steve Howard. Yes. \u201cBoth share the Park Hall Stadium in Oswestry, England, yet the New Saints are \u2018Welsh\u2019 and St Martins play in the English pyramid.\u201d Then of course there\u2019s the one-club case of Chester City \u2026 And finally, an amendment. \u201cNever mind Fortuna Sittard,\u201d writes Wim Joefs (and others). The Roda JC stadium in Kerkrade, the Netherlands, is less than 15km from Alemmania Aachen.\u201d  Can you help? \u201cBetween 1911 and 1927, there was a run of 13 consecutive FA Cup finals in which the runners-up failed to score (14 matches if you include the 1912 replay),\u201d notes John Stephenson. \u201cAre there any examples of longer consecutive runs in other club finals anywhere?\u201d   \u201cIvo Stas is legendary for scoring an own goal against Aston Villa while playing for Banik Ostrava in 1990. Villa subsequently signed him; he promptly picked up an injury in his first training session and never featured for Villa.

                    "body": "Last week, Matildas\u2019 coach Tony Gustavsson cut a customarily jovial figure as he helped announce February\u2019s Cup of Nations. The Swede had good reason to be convivial; the mini-tournament provides a chance to continue momentum from a successful November international window with a group-stage simulation against Spain, Jamaica and Czechia across Sydney, Gosford and Newcastle. The New South Wales slant of the host cities is clear, and has been met with predictable reactions. In the wake of furious backlash to the Australian Professional Leagues\u2019s sale of hosting rights for the next three A-Leagues grand finals to Sydney, Football Australia\u2019s announcement that the Matildas\u2019 next outings will be played exclusively in NSW was inevitably going to be conflated \u2013 even though the APL and FA are completely separate decision-making bodies. \u201cCan you please start calling yourselves the NSW Matildas?\u201d a response on Facebook asked. But do the comment sections have a point? Is there a bias toward New South Wales? Looking at the numbers, yes.  But there\u2019s some context. To start, the vast majority of Socceroos and Matildas internationals take place overseas: over 150 competitive matches and friendlies have been played beyond Australian shores since the start of 2010.  Of the fixtures played on home soil, nevertheless, there is a statistical basis that shows NSW is a preferred host. Since 2010, the state, per data supplied by Football Australia, has hosted 57% of the Matildas\u2019 home games and 46% of the Socceroos. Victoria follows next with 14% of women\u2019s and 26% of men\u2019s senior national team games, with Queensland the only other state to host a double-digit percentage \u2013 17% of Matildas games since 2010 and 15% of men\u2019s. On a more localised level, Sydney has hosted 33% of Matildas games, followed by Brisbane with 14%, and Melbourne and Newcastle with 10%. The Harbour City has hosted 44% of Socceroos\u2019 games across the period, with Melbourne\u2019s 24% and Brisbane\u2019s 14% the only other double-digit percentage hosts. On a proportional basis, even accounting that NSW is the country\u2019s biggest state from both a football participation and population basis, it\u2019s an uneven split. According to Football Australia\u2019s most recent participation statistics covering 2021, NSW contained 41% of Australia\u2019s football participants while, per ABS statistics, the state is also home to around a third of the population. So why the disproportionality? One of the biggest factors is that the NSW government has simply been consistently far more willing to invest properly in hosting international football than other states; the upcoming Cup of Nations, for example, is being staged in partnership with Destination NSW. This, in theory, then frees up Football Australia to invest revenue that otherwise would have been spent on staging games elsewhere.  \u201cWe don\u2019t run sport, but we are always happy to partner, as we are with Football Australia, in supporting what sporting organisations want to do,\u201d said NSW minister for sport, Alister Henskens. \u201cWe, unashamedly, want to have the best sporting tournaments in Australia here in NSW.\u201d In recent times, there have also been other, external factors forcing the issue. The Matildas\u2019 2020 Olympic qualifiers, for example, were hastily moved to NSW by the Asian Football Confederation amid concerns over a new, highly communicable virus emerging in the games\u2019 original host city, Wuhan. When international football was subsequently sent overseas by Australia\u2019s strict Covid border control policies, only the NSW government was willing to institute bespoke protocols that would allow the Matildas and Socceroos to stage home fixtures with restrictions still in effect a year and a half later. In 2022, the first year Australia was mostly free of Covid policies, the Matildas played six times at home but only once in Sydney: a 2-1 loss to Canada in the first football match played at the new Allianz Stadium. Just one other game was staged in NSW, a 2-0 win over Thailand in Gosford, with the others spread across Townsville, Canberra, Brisbane and Melbourne. With a Women\u2019s World Cup on the horizon, Adelaide\u2019s Hindmarsh Stadium and Perth Oval were both undergoing renovations during this period to bring them up to international standard. Playing three games in Australia during a World Cup year, the Socceroos spread their fixtures across Melbourne, Sydney and Brisbane.  \u201cIt is always Football Australia\u2019s desire to have our national teams play in as many cities and regions across the country as possible, where over the past decade all states and territories outside of Tasmania and the Northern Territory have hosted senior national team matches,\u201d a Football Australia spokesperson said. \u201cThere are many factors which go into determining where matches are ultimately played including venue availability and size of venue against expected demand, plus team movement and logistics. \u201cThere is also a commercial reality to any national team match, as staging games and hosting touring teams is an expensive exercise, so that\u2019s where Football Australia works with state and territory governments around their appetite to financially support the hosting of national team content. \u201cFootball Australia is committed to taking our senior and youth national teams to as many parts of Australia as possible and is eager to work with all state and territory governments to make this a reality.\u201d"

But if he couldn\u2019t see the large numbers of his own party\u2019s backbench MPs queueing up to voice their outrage at his proposal to restart fracking when he made his announcement a few weeks ago then he should certainly have been able to hear them. The Conservative Environment Network is already plotting to force another Truss U-turn. The Tory MP Brendan Clarke-Smith recently said on Question Time that he didn\u2019t want drilling in his constituency. Local communities from Lancashire to Sussex have been challenging fracking for a decade. Every single poll shows that the public are strongly opposed. And even if we frack in the UK, energy bills won\u2019t come down, since the gas will get sold on international markets, and global emissions will still increase, as exporter countries like Qatar and Norway won\u2019t reduce their own gas extraction by an equivalent amount \u2013 so that puts the planet firmly against it too. Sadly, fracking isn\u2019t the only issue where this government is so dangerously out of step with public opinion \u2013 from threatening to scrap the environmental land management scheme and tearing up more than 570 environmental protections in the \u201cBrexit freedoms bill\u201d, to lifting the cap on bankers\u2019 bonuses.

                    "body": "Close games and exciting finishes have been a highlight of the Cricket World Cup so far, but it seems Australia have no interest in anything less than total domination. Even when the opposition have felt like they are in with a chance, whether it is through a strong batting performance to set a record total for a chase or taking multiple quick wickets to see off the top order cheaply, Meg Lanning\u2019s side simply refuses to be beaten. What kind of person, then does it take to walk into a team this dominant and not only hold her own, but excel? Enter Alana King, the 26-year-old leg spinner who was selected in the team for the Ashes after an ACL injury ruled out incumbent Georgia Wareham. Unlike some of the teenage quicks who burst onto the scene each summer in the Women\u2019s Big Bash League, King did not appear as if from nowhere. Over the seven seasons of the WBBL, she gradually imprinted herself on the public consciousness until she became a familiar face. King believes this more gradual rise has been instrumental to her success.  \u201cPeople will get their opportunities at different times,\u201d she says from the Australian team\u2019s base in Wellington. \u201cI\u2019ve obviously had to wait a few more years than others, but it\u2019s meant that I\u2019m really happy with where I am and I\u2019m confident in where my cricket is. I think you\u2019ve got to, first and foremost, be comfortable in your own skin. And I have done that over the last few years.\u201d It is that confidence in herself that allows King to be so calm. When the pressure started to build in the game against South Africa and none of the six previous bowlers had been able to break the opening partnership, King was thrilled to be given the opportunity. \u201cTo be honest, I think I\u2019ve been blessed to be in those positions before whether it was at the Stars or the Scorchers,\u201d she said. \u201cI love to get the ball thrown to me in those type of situations, I think it really brings the best out in me, because you\u2019ve got to be on from ball one. And I really like that challenge.\u201d That aspect of her personality shines through in the way she approaches the difficult art of leg spin. While she had role models from her older brother to the king of spin himself Shane Warne, it was her willingness to embrace difference that first set her on that path. \u201cI just realised that everyone was bowling pace, I want to do something different,\u201d she said. \u201cI want to do something different\u201d could well be the motto for King\u2019s career. In every moment she is completely authentic and has no interest in compromising her beliefs to fit in with the crowd.   Over the past two seasons of the WBBL King, whose parents hail from Chennai in India, has consistently taken a knee before each game \u2013 even though many of her teammates have chosen not to. The eradication of racism and discrimination is a cause she believes in passionately. \u201cIt\u2019s to represent my family and what they\u2019ve been through,\u201d she says. \u201cI think having immigrant parents who moved over to Australia in the 80s, they faced a fair bit of discrimination. This is me standing up for them because they went through a lot.\u201d While she may sometimes be a lone figure in making this symbolic gesture, King feels supported by her teammates whether they stand or kneel with her. \u201cWhen I\u2019ve spoken to the team regarding why I want to do it, I\u2019ve had nothing but full support,\u201d she says. \u201cJust before the WBBL this season it was raised again, and I was happy to speak to the group and told them why I want to do it and what it means to me. I think it can be quite powerful when you\u2019ve got your whole team around you supporting what you\u2019re doing.\u201d The ever-increasing visibility of the WBBL and women\u2019s cricket more broadly has been important to King, not just for her own career, but because of the opportunities it offers to educate and raise awareness of the effects of racism and discrimination for people all over the world.  As her own platform has increased as a result of breaking into the Australian team and making her mark on one of the world\u2019s biggest stages, she has taken the time to reflect on how she can use that influence. While she belonged to a junior club that was diverse and inclusive, she knows that in many places in Australia, cricket has been a predominantly white sport. King hopes she can show people that is changing. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to use the platforms you\u2019re on,\u201d she says. \u201cIf I can inspire the younger generation of subcontinent kids to pick up a bat and ball and to aspire to play for Australia, even though they\u2019re from a subcontinent background, that\u2019s one thing that I\u2019m really passionate about.\u201d \u201cKnowing that they can play for this beautiful country that we live in and they\u2019ve got role models that they can look up to, whether it\u2019s Usman Khawaja in the men\u2019s team or myself in the women\u2019s team, I think that\u2019s big.\u201d In the immediate future, King\u2019s thoughts are firmly on Wednesday\u2019s semi-final against the West Indies and the opportunity to help propel Australia to a desperately sought World Cup win with her ability to take wickets in key moments. But her passion, determination and willingness to stand out from the crowd means that her long-term future is destined to be even more exciting \u2013 both on and off the field."

Then pancakes one the air where the ball swirls about and Dean at mid-on, trying to follow its path, can\u2019t get a finger on the ball and it falls safely to the ground.      7.27am    21st over: South Africa 74-4 (du Preez 16, Kapp 4) Slow and tight from Charlie Dean and South Africa can\u2019t break the shackles.      7.25am    20th over: South Africa 72-4 (du Preez 15, Kapp 3) Cross is tidy, South Africa do some casual pruning. On the boundary Lisa Keighley makes urgent notes with a pencil.   This is interesting - and true I think. After all the Burns-Hartley stuff last (?) year. Not than anyone has to support anyone else - but it had all gone very quiet.  Updated at 7.26am BST    7.19am    19th over: South Africa 70-4 (du Preez 14, Kapp 2) Knight turns to Charlie Dean, and she makes a breakthrough with her third ball! She\u2019s got a golden arm, this girl.      7.17am   WICKET! Goodall b Dean 29 (South Africa 67-4)   Attempts to paddle sweep but misses, shuffles too far across the stumps, and is unceremoniously bowled     7.14am    18th over: South Africa 66-3 (Goodall 29, du Preez 12) The current run rate 3.71, the required run-rate 7.05. South Africa have been brilliant in this competition, but I\u2019m just not sure where the runs are going to come from. Cross is characteristically neat and tidy again, pinning Goodall to the stumps with her last ball.     7.10am    17th over: South Africa 65-3 (Goodall 29, du Preez 11) Sciver resumes, bowling in a short sleeved jumper, South Africa can only squeeze two from the over; and they\u2019ve got ten overs of Ecclestone to get through.      7.08am    16th over: South Africa 63-3 (Goodall 28, du Preez 10) It looks like it is getting a bit chilly out there at the Hagley Oval, the jumpers are on in the crowd. A nice diving stop by Wyatt to cut off a cut by du Preez. They stop for DRINKS, with the run rate creeping up towards seven an over.     7.02am    15th over: South Africa 61-3 (Goodall 27, du Preez 9) Five from Sciver\u2019s over.      7.00am    14th over: South Africa 56-3 (Goodall 24, du Preez 7) du Preez reaches the boundary with a thick edge off Cross that just beats Sophie Ecclestone who ends up splodged on the ground. Some kids are having an absolute ball sliding down the World Cup sign embedded in the grass in a deconstructed cardboard box. As cricket should be.  Shout out from this end too!     6.56am    13th over: South Africa 48-3 (Goodall 23, du Preez 1) Goodall continues to pinch and poke. An email! It\u2019s from my brother in law Chris in Sedona-Arizona. \u201cGrandad says we should win it with the runs we have on the board. Only we just found out he has Covid. Does that count as potentially clouded judgment?\u201d He\u2019s a pretty wise old owl, I think he\u2019s still got it. And get well soon!     6.51am    12th over: South Africa 44-3 (Goodall 18) Cross breaks through in her first over, and burst into a grin of delight, fiddling with her hair bobble as she always does. The seam of the white balls spins and twists in the slo-mo replay and that\u2019s such an important wicket to get rid of the South African captain. In Manchester, it has started snowing.   Updated at 6.54am BST    6.48am   WICKET! Luus b Cross 21 (South Africa 44-3)   Beautiful from Cross! One that nips back and skittles through the gate as Luus shapes to drive.      6.46am    11th over: South Africa 41-2 (Goodall 18, Luus 20) Ooof, top-edge by Luus off Sciver that flies just wide of mid-wicket, then Goodall runs without urgency and is only just in as the third umpires checks for a run out.      6.42am    10th over: South Africa 37-2 (Goodall 18, Luus 16)  An over of plenty for South Africa. Luus plumps her front foot and swings for four,. a couple more through the covers, then four more behind square. Eleven from it. And during that over England completed their 2000th ball in this World Cup without overstepping - a somewhat mind-boggling stat. Fantastic discipline.     6.36am    9th over: South Africa 26-2 (Goodall 18, Luus 5) Time for Sciver, and she\u2019s tidy. And she\u2019s more than that, as she beats Goodall\u2019s bat twice, and then powers the ball to mid-wicket where Charlie Dean mistimes her jump and drops a rocket.      6.34am    8th over: South Africa 25-2 (Goodall 18, Luus 4) South Africa suddenly playing with a little more zig-a-zig-ah. Goodall unveils an eggs-over-easy flick over midwicket that even makes Anya Shrubsole pull a face in appreciation.      6.29am    7th over: South Africa 20-2 (Goodall 14, Luus 3) Gorgeous shot from Goodall, as she pounces on a short one from Brunt and sends it spinning to the boundary. The last ball is a short one too, and Goodall repeats the shot, with the same result      6.26am    6th over: South Africa 12-2 (Goodall 6, Luus 3) Shrubsole has the ball boomeranging: Luus drives, a leading edge, and it flies, jauntily, riskily, over point.      6.24am    5th over: South Africa 8-2 (Goodall 5, Luus 0) Brunt completes another over, another maiden, South Africa still haven\u2019t managed to squeeze a run off her today. Goodall hits Brunt back over her head, Brunt leaps and the ball brushes her hands - before falling to the ground. A chance - a tricky one - but a chance. Brunt glares.      6.21am    4th over: South Africa 8-2 (Goodall 5) Is that it? Is it already over? With both South Africa\u2019s openers back contemplating their ankles, it must be likely. Lee will be disappointed with that nothing shot. And Shrubsole strikes again!     6.18am   WICKET! Lee c Sciver b Shrubsole 2 (South Africa 8-2)  Snaffled at midwicket! Sciver swoops with both hands as Lee flicks the ball straight to her to continue her down-beat tournament.     6.16am    3rd over: South Africa 5-1 (Lee 0; Goodall 4) Brunt produces an absolute beauty which somehow skims the top of off stump, by the skin of a custard, as Lee boldly leaves one that nips in. A maiden.      6.14am    2nd over: South Africa 5-1 (Lee 0; Goodall 4) Fab from Shrubsole, who time and again, when you think it might be time for her to hang up her boots, produces the goods. Such an important wicket that for England. Goodall off the mark with a boundary as Shrubsole drifts legside.  If you\u2019re munching in your cornflakes in the UK, sunning yourself on the gorgeous grassy banks of the Hagley over, or anywhere in between, do drop me a line     6.08am   WICKET!  Wolvaardt c and b Shrubsole 0 (South Africa 1-0)   Gone! The tournament\u2019s leading run-scorer trudges off, nose down, bat held horizontally, as Shrubsole pulls off an athletic bit of work, plucking the grape from the vine as Wolvaardt lollops back a return catch.      6.04am    1st over: South Africa 1-0 (Lee 0; Wolvaardt 0) Lizelle Lee blocks Katherine Brunt\u2019s first ball, the two old warhorses ready for battle. She blocks the second as the TV flashes up a win predictor of 84 per cent for England. And the third, the fourth, the sixth and the last. A solitary run comes from a wide.     5.59am   South Africa need 294 to win at 5.88 an over!  And here they come!     5.58am    Incidentally, Wyatt was dropped FIVE times!  Ismail was the pick of the bowlers (3-46), well back up by Marizanne Kapp (2-52) and Klass (2-55), though they were clobbered a bit towards the end. Some stats on the bowling attacks: England rely heavily on their spinners.      5.48am    Thanks James, you\u2019re a star for taking the night shift. It is indeed chilly in Manchester, the cars frosted and blossoms browned. England, however, were red hot! What an amazing century by Danni Wyatt, and classy innings by Sophia Dunkley and last-gasp hitting by Sophie Ecclestone. England will back themselves here - it should be more than enough on a cracking pitch.   Updated at 5.54am BST    5.42am    England have given themselves every chance of making the World Cup Final. But beware South Africa, they love to get stuck into a run chase.  With that I\u2019m going to hand over to Tanya Aldred who is up with the lark in what I presume is a chilly Manchester, she\u2019ll take you through the second half of this absorbing game. Good morning and Goodnight!     5.35am         5.33am   England finish on 293-8  Ecclestone helps a slower ball round the corner for four! And a top edge goes for four more! And another! Three in a row for Ecclestone! Pitched up and clobbered down the ground. Ismail follows up with a yorker. Dot ball. Last ball of the innings... Ecclestone backs away and is bowled. What a cameo though, Ecclestone scored 24 off just 11 balls.  South Africa will need a World Cup record chase of 294 runs to win and make the final.      5.28am   Wicket! Dunkley ct Lee b Ismail (England 281-7)  Dunkley goes off the first ball from Ismail. Caught at mid on. Her teammates stand to applaud her, they know just how important that innings could be.      5.26am    48th over: England 281-6 (Dunkley 60, Ecclestone 12 ) Two singles off Khaka. Dunkley then drives for four! She keeps strike for the last with a single off the final ball.      5.24am    48th over: England 276-6 (Dunkley 54, Ecclestone 11 ) Kapp to bowl her last. Three singles into the deep. Dunkley drives but it hits the stumps at the other end. Another single. Ecclestone drives straight for four! Then sweeps for four! 12 runs off the over. Two to go. Every run crucial as South Africa love to chase, there don\u2019t look to be many demons in this pitch.   Updated at 5.47am BST    5.18am    47th over: England 262-6 (Dunkley 52, Ecclestone 1) Sophie Ecclestone at the crease and off the mark straight away with a single to fine leg. Three overs to go. South Africa just pegging England back a bit here.    Updated at 5.19am BST    5.17am   Wicket! Brunt b Klaas 9 (England 261-6)  Bowled by the sloooowest of slow balls.      5.14am    46th over: England 256-5 (Dunkley 50, Brunt 6)Dunkley unfurls a lovely back foot punch to go to 49. A single down the ground brings up fifty! Her third in ODIs and her second of this World Cup. Cool, calm, and classy. Well batted Sophia Dunkley. Brunt goes deep in the crease and crunches a drive away through the lengthening shadows for four! She then gives a pull shot some real welly and it is clawed in on the deep boundary.      5.10am    45th over: England 247-5 (Dunkley 47, Brunt 0) Katherine Brunt is the new batter. Khaka greets her with a full ball that misses everything and rolls away for four byes!      5.07am   Wicket! Wyatt ct Lee b Klaas 129 (England 242-5)  Wyatt goes for a brilliant 129. Caught at short third by Lizelle Lee. The South African players offer handshakes and back pats. A lovely moment. A great knock.      5.04am    44th over: England 242-4 (Wyatt 129 , Dunkley 46) Dunkley is opening the shoulders too, swivel-pulling into the wind but the ball evades the sprawling fielders. England continue on their merry way with cuts, sweeps, drives and pulls. South Africa simply unable to stem the flow. The score predictor flashes up 310...     5.00am    43rd over: England 237-4 (Wyatt 127 , Dunkley 43) Wyatt goes over the covers for another boundary! She\u2019s playing a shot a ball now. Sweeping Khaka for a couple and driving for a single. Dunkley then sets about the bowling and England take 11 from the over. Seven to go - all English eyes on the 300. England have six wickets in hand and Wyatt is on the charge.   Updated at 5.04am BST    4.56am    42nd over: England 226-4 (Wyatt 119, Dunkley 41) Ismail scons Dunkley with a quick bouncer. Dunkley grimaces but shrugs it off. A glance into the leg side brings up the hundred partnership for Wyatt and Dunkley! This pair have been outstanding, giving England a toe in the final.   Updated at 4.58am BST    4.53am    41st over: England 223-4 (Wyatt 118, Dunkley 39)Drop! Ismail juggles Wyatt on the boundary and the ball is grassed at the third attempt. The camera cuts to a grinning Heather Knight. Drop again! Wyatt again! A much harder chance, but a diving chance in the covers. The over still yields 5 runs for England in and \u2018mongst the butterfingers.      4.49am    40th over: England 218-4 (Wyatt 116, Dunkley 36) Kapp into her 8th over. She starts with a wide ball for length. The runs are flowing though, Wyatt and Dunkley middling everything and scampering runs with ease. Nine runs coming from the over. Ten overs to go.      4.43am         4.43am    39th over: England 209-4 (Wyatt 109, Dunkley 35) England pick up five singles off Tryon.       4.41am    38th over: England 204-4 (Wyatt 106, Dunkley 34) Kapp back into the attack with South Africa getting desperate for a wicket. Wyatt drives her up and over the infield for four to bring up England\u2019s 200!     4.38am   Century for Danni Wyatt!  Dunkley nudges a single to bring Wyatt on to strike. Deep breath. 99... and DOT. Cut to the fielder. BUT THERE IT IS! 100 for Wyatt! A top knock in a pressure match. She\u2019s been aggressive but also saw off some top bowling early on. A bit of luck along the way with the dropped catches but a fantastic century! Well batted Danni Wyatt.  37th over: England 198-4 (Wyatt 101, Dunkley 32)     4.31am    36th over: England 188-4 (Wyatt 99, Dunkley 29) Wafty drive from Dunkley that flies away over the vacant slips for a couple. A single brings Wyatt onto strike. Can she make it to three figures? A pull for four takes her to 99! Two dots to end the over... she\u2019ll have to wait a smidge longer.      4.28am    35th over: England 180-4 (Wyatt 95, Dunkley 26) Khaka into her 7th over. Dunkley mis-times a drive for a single to mid-on. Slap! Wyatt moves into the 90s with a brutal pull off a full bunger. She loves pace on the ball. Especially if it\u2019s a full toss. Another four! Wyatt hoicks a short one for another boundary to the square leg fence! Fifty partnership up too. Solid platform this for England with 15 to go.      4.24am    34th over: England 171-4 (Wyatt 87, Dunkley 25) Four singles... and then Wyatt laces a drive but straight to Captain Luus at cover, who gives her hands a shake afterwards.      4.21am    33rd over: England 167-4 (Wyatt 85, Dunkley 23) Gem of an innings again from Dunkley, she sweeps Tryon for four! The spinner has gone for 55 from her 8 overs. England rotate for three singles too.      4.18am    32nd over: England 160-4 (Wyatt 83, Dunkley 18) Klaas keeps Dunkley honest and reels off the first maiden of the match. Keep an eye on how many Ecclestone and Cross stitch together later on... England have been going at 5 runs an over.      4.14am    31st over: England 160-4 (Wyatt 83, Dunkley 18)Wyatt is put down by Goodall on the square leg boundary, the ball bursting through her hands and going for four! Wyatt living by the sword and still alive. Four singles and a two make it ten for the over.      4.10am    30th over: England 150-4 (Wyatt 75, Dunkley 16) Ismail back into the fold for her 7th over, a sure sign that South Africa want to break this crucial partnership. A single each to Dunkley and Wyatt. The umpire calls a short ball a wide much to the bowler\u2019s chagrin. 20 overs to go, what will England be happy with? What will South Africa be happy with? Should I know the answers to these questions?    Updated at 4.11am BST    4.06am     29th over: England 147-4 (Wyatt 74, Dunkley 15) Five off the over, Wyatt and Dunkley communicating well and picking up singles and twos. And time for a slurp. Drinks. Imma gonna plump for a Horlicks. Other malty/milky drinks are available.  An email! entitled \u20184AM\u2019 from Rosanna Lynch:  \u201cWho\u2019s tuning in through the night? Me and the cat, both vying for control of the sofa... thanks for the OBO keeping us company.\u201d Top effort Rosanna and cat!      4.01am    28th over: England 142-4 (Wyatt 73, Dunkley 11) Wyatt glances fine for a couple and then drives for a single. Dunkley pulls off the front foot for four! The ball making a satisfying thwock! as it hits the blade. The final ball is driven to mid on for a single. Good stuff from England.      3.56am    27th over: England 134-4 (Wyatt 70, Dunkley 6) Wyatt continues to play attacking shots, a flat bat shot back past the bowler only brings her one. Dunkley then is down on her haunches and paddles the spinner for a couple, she then rocks back and crisply drives for four! Shot!     3.53am    26th over: England 125-4 (Wyatt 69, Dunkley 0) Sophia Dunkley arrives at the crease. She\u2019s been Mrs Consistent so far in the tournament. England need her to build another partnership with Wyatt here.      3.51am   Wicket! Jones ct Tryon b Kapp 28 (England 126-4)  Kapp breaks the partnership and bellows a full throated roar into the Christchurch breeze! Amy Jones hurried up by a short ball and caught at mid-wicket.      3.48am    25th over: England 121-3 (Wyatt 64, Jones 28) This is riveting cricket, befitting a World Cup semi final. Half way through the innings and both teams going toe to toe. England take 8 runs from Klaas, Wyatt bunting down the ground and slicing through point. Jones chipping into the leg side for a couple. This feels like a crucial passage of play, both sides vying to get on top.      3.45am    24th over: England 113-3 (Wyatt 59, Jones 25) Amy Jones scorches a drive away across the carpet. Four runs. She has made a very perky 25 runs here, taking the pressure off Wyatt too.      3.43am    23rd over: England 108-3 (Wyatt 59, Jones 20) Four runs off Klaas\u2019s latest. Decent partnership building between these two batters. And no that isn\u2019t a jinx.      3.41am    22nd over: England 104-3 (Wyatt 58, Jones 17) 100 up for England. Amy Jones bookends the over with boundaries. The first is a lovely cover drive, the second a meaty edge through the vacant slip region that rolls away for four. The clock creeps towards 4am here in England. Any die-hard fans out there tuning in through the night? Time it was, and what a time it was, it was.       3.35am    21st over: England 96-3 (Wyatt 58, Jones 9) Tryon whirls away, Wyatt rides her luck, a clubbed shot landing just wide of mid-on! England still take seven from the over, a combination of paddles and pushed drives.      3.28am    20th over: England 89-3 (Wyatt 55, Jones 5) Ismail is taken out of the attack after getting the breakthrough, the skipper keeping 4 overs from her up her green sleeve. Khaka is back for her fourth over and England take three singles form it. Twenty overs done. Anyone\u2019s game at the moment.      3.24am    19th over: England 86-3 (Wyatt 54, Jones 3) Fifty for Danii Wyatt! off 56 balls. Her second of the tournament. She\u2019s found form at the business end. She paddle sweeps Tryon for a scampered three and Amy Jones is into her work too.      3.21am    18th over: England 79-3 (Wyatt 48, Jones 1) Ismail bowls a fast bouncer to Amy Jones first up! The bowler has got her dander up here, the ball to dismiss Sciver hurried the batter for pace and she wasn\u2019t able to keep it down. This game is waiting for someone to put their name on it.      3.18am   Wicket! Sciver ct Kapp b Ismail 15 (England 77-3)  Sciver gets a pull shot too high on the bat and is pouched by Kapp at square leg! Big wicket for South Africa!   Updated at 3.18am BST    3.17am    17th over: England 77-2 (Wyatt 48, Sciver 15) More rotation from England, they are happy to pick up singles.      3.15am    16th over: England 71-2 (Wyatt 44, Sciver 13) Ismail back into the attack for her fifth over. Sciver glides away for a single. Wyatt gets an inside edge to fine leg and they come back for two. Wyatt then pushes a single into the covers. Nice from Wyatt, she\u2019s not all crash, bang, whallop. Intelligent batting. England need a big score from her.      3.09am    15th over: England 67-2 (Wyatt 41, Sciver 12) Spin for the first time as Chloe Tryon comes on for a twirl. Sciver whips a full ball off her toes for a couple. Then leans back to cut a shorter delivery for a single. She has been very busy so far. Wyatt joins in with a nudge off her pads for a couple. Risk free cricket from England.      3.06am    14th over: England 62-2 (Wyatt 39, Sciver 9) TV replays are showing Nat Sciver\u2019s weird dismissal from the group stages when the two sides played before. Remember the ball looping off the back of her bat and hip? She\u2019ll be very keen to avenge that moment of misfortune here. That\u2019ll help! A short ball is nailed for four by Sciver, a rasping pull shot. England rotate well, ten from the over.      3.01am    13th over: England 52-2 (Wyatt 37, Sciver 1) Khaka finishes off her over, Sciver jabs down on a full ball to pick up a quick single.       2.59am    Drinks. Knight was becalmed at the crease. The South African seamers bowled tight lines to her and she couldn\u2019t rotate strike or pierce the infield. Nat Sciver is the new batter. The game on a knife-edge.      2.57am   Wicket! Knight lbw b Khaka 1 (England 51-2)  Pinned in front and Knight has to go! Three reds in the review and South Africa pick up their second.      2.54am    12th over: England 50-1 (Wyatt 37, Knight 1) Shot! Wyatt launches Klaas away up and over extra cover for another boundary. DROP! Wow. Wyatt plinks a pull high on the bat and into the breeze, Marizanne Kapp diving but the ball goes through her. A bad miss on the replay. Fifty up for England too. The sun is out and shining on Danni Wyatt at the moment.      2.50am    11th over: England 45-1 (Wyatt 32, Knight 1) Khaka sends down five dots. Good cricket this. Ebb and flow. Nip and tuck. Bat v ball. Green v Blue. Wyatt drives a single off the last ball.      2.47am    10th over: England 44-1 (Wyatt 31, Knight 1) Drop! Lizelle Lee grasses one at wide slip! Wyatt pokes at a length ball from new bowler Masabata Klaas but the chance goes begging. Wyatt then rubs a big dollop of sodium chloride in the wound by crunching a cover drive for four! Don\u2019t run for that! Wyatt has looked very aggressive and moves into the thirties. Heather Knight still languishes on one run from 16 balls. She won\u2019t be too fussed though with Wyatt at the other end keeping things moving. PowerPlay done.      2.41am    9th over: England 35-1 (Wyatt 22, Knight 1)Ayabonga Khaka is on in place of Ismail and she struggles with her line first up, Wyatt cuts her away for back to back boundaries! An outside edge brings two more and a quick single brings Knight on to strike. REVIEW for LBW! Nip backer pins Knight on the pad but it looks a smidge high. Not out on the field... and stays that way - the impact was outside the line. South Africa lose a review. 12 off the over.      2.37am    8th over: England 23-1 (Wyatt 11, Knight 1)Wyatt is middling everything but straight to a fielder each time! Five dot balls and then a change of tack, she drops and runs to pinch the strike.      2.33am    7th over: England 22-1 (Wyatt 10, Knight 1)Wyatt cuts away in the air for four. England\u2019s second boundary. The pressure valve just hisses slightly. It was uppish but just out of reach from the diving point fielder. A wide and a single nudge England\u2019s score upward.     2.30am    6th over: England 16-1 (Wyatt 4, Knight 1) Wyatt gets off strike with a single to square leg. Kapp then keeps Knight honest, reeling off five dots in a row. HK has just 1 from 11 balls so far, but she\u2019s hanging tough against some probing seam bowling.      2.24am    5th over: England 15-1 (Wyatt 4, Knight 1)Wyatt scythes a cut shot away in the air but into the gap, just a single. Knight gets off the mark with a single. Ismail looks threatening, the breeze at her back.      2.19am    4th over: England 11-1 (Wyatt 2, Knight 0) Two slips in for Heather Knight. She watches Kapp sling one outside the off peg and then slip one down the leg-side for a wide.England remain the only side not to get a fifty opening stand in this tournament. Skipper Knight is at the crease early again.   Updated at 2.21am BST    2.16am   Wicket! Beaumont ct Chetty b Kapp 7 (England 10-1)  Gone! Beaumont takes a step down the wicket to Kapp but ends up wafting at a back of a length ball, getting a tickle and the keeper gladly snaffles. England lose their first.      2.14am    3rd over: England 10-0 (Beaumont 7, Wyatt 2) Beaumont and Wyatt look keen to get bat on ball, both a little guilty of losing their shape as they try and hit a tad too hard. Ismail bowls a tight and fast over, she pins Beaumont on the pad and there\u2019s a big appeal but the umpire says no dice. It would have been \u2018umpires call\u2019 if SA had reviewed... Five dots and a single off the last.      2.10am    2nd over: England 9-0 (Beaumont 6, Wyatt 2) Marizanne Kapp, England\u2019s tormentor in chief the last time the two sides met, is on to bowl her slingy seamers. She starts with a wide. Wyatt then cuts away for a single and Beaumont gets away with a weird looking poke that goes wide of point. Movement through the air from Kapp.      2.06am    1st over: England 6-0 (Beaumont 5, Wyatt 1) Tammy Beaumont drives the first ball of the match for four! A beauty first up. The outfield looks quick, the ball laced away to the fence. There\u2019s a couple of singles, Wyatt gets of the mark with a tickle to third man. Beaumont is then cloth\u2019d on the helmet with the final ball, she went to pull and missed, the short ball from Ismail clonking her right on the three lions badge. She\u2019s ok though. Game on.      2.00am    Here we go! Shabnim Ismail will have first use of the ball and here she comes to Tammy Beaumont. Danni Wyatt is at t\u2019other end. PLAY!      1.58am    The players belt out the anthems, there\u2019s dappled sunlight and a bit of a breeze in Christchurch. The pitch is biscuit-brown-ish in colour, I\u2019d say a malted milk. Word from the ground is there might be some assistance to the bowlers first up. Heather Knight admitted she would have bowled first. But England have the chance to get runs on the board.   Updated at 2.02am BST    1.55am    Congratulations to Sune Luus and Lizelle Lee and what an occasion for a 100th ODI!      1.53am    South Africa are unchanged:  South Africa: Lizelle Lee, Laura Wolvaardt, Lara Goodall, Sune Luus(c), Mignon du Preez, Marizanne Kapp, Chloe Tryon, Trisha Chetty(w), Shabnim Ismail, Masabata Klaas, Ayabonga Khaka      1.49am    One change for England - Anya Shrubsole comes back into the side in place of Freya Davies.      1.48am   South Africa win the toss...  They choose to bowl first     1.45am    Preamble Three\u2019s a crowd. Hello and welcome to this OBO of the second World Cup semi-final between England and South Africa from the Hagley Oval, Christchurch. Predictably, the Aussies boshed their way past West Indies in yesterday\u2019s match and they lie in wait for the victors today, looming yet dormant - like a big yella Dracula? Me either. It\u2019s late here in South London.  Today\u2019s day/nighter semi boasts the number one ODI batter \u2013 the Proteas\u2019 vulpine Laura Wolvaardt - lining up against the number one ODI bowler in Sophie Ecclestone, England\u2019s be-plaited spinning hero. The number crunchers at the ICC must be doing something right, Ecclestone sits at the top of the World Cup wickets column with 14 scalps and Wolvaardt is the tournament\u2019s leading run scorer with 433 runs. Only one can prosper today.  England have momentum after four wins on the bounce but South Africa the recent muscle-memory of victory, they ran out winners by three wickets, with four balls to spare, when the two teams squared up in the group stages, a defeat that left Knight and co peering into the World Cup abyss.  We\u2019ve been here before of course, England wobbled their way past South Africa in the semi-final at Bristol in 2017 on their way to lifting the trophy. Will history repeat or will South Africa take revenge? Let\u2019s find out!  As ever, do get in touch if you are tuning in, I\u2019d be glad of the company.  Play gets underway in 30 minutes time - 2pm local time, 2AM GMT and 12pm AEDT.   "

                    "body": "  4.25am    That\u2019s it for our coverage today. Keep an eye out for a match report to go up shortly, and please do join us throughout the rest of the tournament. Bye for now.     4.24am    As it happens, this is Australia\u2019s 100th ODI win against New Zealand. Now they will take it to the West Indies on Tuesday at this same venue. Lanning is praising the depth of her squad, especially the lower order who she says \u201ccan rescue our innings\u201d. She is, of course, referring to Gardner, who missed the start of Australia\u2019s campaign after testing positive for Covid but returned in indefatigable fashion. \u201cIt was great to have her back,\u201d Lanning says. \u201cObviously a tough 10 days for her but she\u2019s come back incredibly well. That innings certainly gave us the momentum heading into the bowling. We thought it was a good score without match-winning and probably went a bit too hard to get their key batters out.\u201d     4.15am    Speaking of Devine, she has just spoken about her side\u2019s performance and is disappointed with their batting display and says Australia\u2019s batting was the \u201cblueprint\u201d for success. \u201cThe reason we wanted to bowl first was to contain them and get a few more wickets and put the pressure on them,\u201d she says. \u201cGuess that shows the quality of the Australian side as, even though they were three to four down, had the run rate under control and were able to launch in the death overs.\u201d Now she\u2019s talking about Gardner\u2019s performance and Australia\u2019s all-round output with the bat. \u201cShe hit with the wind and was outstanding the way she played. We certainly would have to go back to our plans around how you gonna do it but, it\u2019s always tough with the wind and credit goes to Australia. We certainly can be better. We know this is a good cricket wicket and if we were able to keep wickets in hand, certainly a chasable target. Poor batting performance. The way Australians set it up, that\u2019s the blueprint.\u201d NZ next face South Africa in Hamilton on Thursday.     4.09am    And so it transpired, the White Ferns had Australia on the ropes during their innings at 164-4 at the close of the 40th over. Enter Gardner with her unbeaten 48 off 18 balls, which had the hosts reeling and then tasked with chasing 270. Perry\u2019s knock of 68 and her wicket with the ball has her named player of the match. Her dismissal of Devine was key in sucking the wind out of NZ\u2019s innings.  Updated at 4.10am GMT    4.05am   Australia beat New Zealand by 141 runs  The Kiwis are 128 all out and Lanning\u2019s team win their third match on the hop and regain top spot in the standings, with India in second, South Africa third and NZ fourth. This is a big result for both teams. While Australia are in the box seat for the semis, the path is less straightforward for their trans-Tasman counterparts.     4.01am   Wicket! Tahuhu 23 c Mooney b Gardner  Gardner bows to Tahuhu and she arcs her shot straight to deep mid-wicket, where Mooney\u2019s safe hands are waiting. She takes it, and Australia take the match.     3.59am    30th over: New Zealand 128-9 (Lea Tahuhu 23, Jess Kerr 6) Schutt sends down a delivery wide of off and Kerr\u2019s outside edge is in just the right position to send the ball to the ropes between short third and backward point. Another Kerr edge is almost caught and then, in the final ball of the over, Tahuhu chips and King runs in but can\u2019t quite get there.     3.54am   Wicket! Satterthwaite 44 c Lanning b Gardner  29th over: New Zealand 122-9 (Lea Tahuhu 22, Jess Kerr 1) Satterthwaite, for her impressive innings and a lone hand who helped keep her battling team afloat, is out off what would hardly even qualify as a shot. She scoops Gardner\u2019s delivery towards cover and Lanning makes a run for it. The captain almost looks as if she won\u2019t make it but make it she does, and Australia need one more wicket for victory.     3.51am    28th over: New Zealand 120-8 (Amy Satterthwaite 44, Lea Tahuhu 21) Schutt starts her second spell and conceded only two singles. There must be another wicket coming soon.     3.45am    27th over: New Zealand 118-8 (Amy Satterthwaite 43, Lea Tahuhu 20) Big appeal from Australia for lbw on Tahuhu facing Gardner! The White Ferns review. Delivery is good, but did it make contact with bat? Nope, it\u2019s pad first. But ball tracking shows it has pitched outside leg! Safe. Can this pair build a partnership at death\u2019s door?     3.40am    26th over: New Zealand 116-8 (Amy Satterthwaite 42, Lea Tahuhu 19) It\u2019s Satterthwaite\u2019s turn to put some runs on the board with two fours of her own. Against Wellington she places it perfectly over mid-wicket. The second is a mishit, an edge that races away behind and past the keeper. That\u2019s a bit lucky, but she\u2019ll take it.     3.37am    25th over: New Zealand 106-8 (Amy Satterthwaite 33, Lea Tahuhu 18) Tahuhu is going for it, and she may as well at this point. Go out swinging, as they say. She tests Ash Gardner on her first over and then swipes over cover for four. Two balls later she scoops another high, a catch-in-waiting that King cannot quite take. The ball scoots away to the ropes for another four. She\u2019s brought up NZ\u2019s century at least.     3.33am    24th over: New Zealand 95-8 (Amy Satterthwaite 32, Lea Tahuhu 8) Tahuhu hits Wellington for six! She connects perfectly with the delivery and sweeps up and over. It\u2019s almost a done deal but Mooney is there, and we\u2019ve seen what Mooney can do. She takes a courageous leap. She\u2019s just in front of the ropes and looking up into the sun, which doesn\u2019t help her cause as she back-steps into the boundary and the ball sails past. That was nice to watch.     3.30am   Wicket! Rowe 6 c Perry b Schutt  23rd over: New Zealand 87-8 (Amy Satterthwaite 31, Lea Tahuhu 1) This is surely one of the most straightforward catches of Parry\u2019s distinguished career. Schutt roles over her delivery, Rowe is static and can\u2019t set herself. She pops it up and Perry says thank you very much. Lea Tahuhu comes in and faces two balls for no return before pumping the third straight down the ground for one.     3.24am    22nd over: New Zealand 85-7 (Amy Satterthwaite 30, Hannah Rowe 6) The tail wags a little as Satterthwaite smacks a four past cover. Wellington tries again and she flat misses before picking up a single and watching Rowe drive for two.  Updated at 3.26am GMT    3.23am    21st over: New Zealand 78-7 (Amy Satterthwaite 25, Hannah Rowe 4) Rowe takes a few balls to get herself set, blocking and nudging Schutt before driving her for four. Promising start.  Updated at 3.26am GMT    3.21am   Wicket! Jensen 0 c McGrath b Wellington  20th over: New Zealand 73-7 (Amy Satterthwaite 24, Hannah Rowe 0) Hayley Jensen has barely taken her place and she\u2019s out for a golden duck! Wellington sends her delivery outside off and Jensen is off balance, popping the ball high enough for McGrath to take the catch at cover point. Jensen was invited into that and got done hook, line and sinker. A warm welcome to Hannah Rowe.  Updated at 3.23am GMT    3.17am   Wicket! Martin 19 lbw b Wellington, New Zealand 73-7  Lanning is tweaking her fielding set-up with each ball. She doesn\u2019t even need them though because Wellington has done it all herself. She\u2019s not the quickest of the spinners but it\u2019s full-flighted and lands at Martin\u2019s toes if not on them. The batter has started walking before the umpire has even given the signal.     3.13am    19th over: New Zealand 70-5 (Amy Satterthwaite 22, Katey Martin 18) There\u2019s a cry of \u201ccome on Schutter\u201d as she mixes up her deliveries and forces the batters to adjust basically with every ball they face. Satterthwaite steals a single but almost pays for it with her wicket, only marginally making it back to her crease. Had the fielder made a direct hit she would not have been so lucky. There\u2019s a bit of a break in proceedings after the over as Martin takes time out to talk to coaches. The umpires are there too. It\u2019s unclear what the problem is, if it\u2019s injury or if she\u2019s feeling unwell. She hasn\u2019t taken a hit. After a couple of minutes she puts back on her helmet and continues.     3.08am    18th over: New Zealand 68-5 (Amy Satterthwaite 21, Katey Martin 17) Wellington is giving nothing away, bar a couple of singles. Australia\u2019s bowling has been ... compact. Ungenerous. Unyielding. Here\u2019s Beth Mooney\u2019s catch from earlier. Well worth the watch.      3.04am    17th over: New Zealand 66-5 (Amy Satterthwaite 20, Katey Martin 16) Another bowling change-up with Schutt coming in. Much later than anticipated, but in nonetheless. Her opening over is marked by two wides.     3.01am    16th over: New Zealand 61-5 (Amy Satterthwaite 18, Katey Martin 15) We have some spin for the first time! Leggie Amanda Wellington makes her entrance. I\u2019ve cracked open some Easter eggs to mark the occasion. I\u2019m aware it\u2019s not yet Easter but chocolate tastes better in Easter egg form. I am one of those people at the supermarket two months early, pouncing on the low-brow Cadbury specials. But we digress. Martin drives Wellington\u2019s first delivery but gets no runs for her efforts. She evades the slips in her second for a single before she and Satterthwaite trade singles.  Updated at 3.01am GMT    2.57am    15th over: New Zealand 57-5 (Amy Satterthwaite 16, Katey Martin 13) NZ are settling a little bit, at a crucial time, and make two boundaries against McGrath. Satterthwaite hits the first. Cuts it, more accurately. Martin follows with her own four, pouncing early for a pull shot that races away to the ropes. Another couple of singles makes for a fruitful over.     2.52am    14th over: New Zealand 47-5 (Amy Satterthwaite 11, Katey Martin 8) Brown takes over from McGrath again. She bowls two dot balls to Satterthwaite, who then hits her for three to cover. Martin has a crack and her timing is off on the first ball but she has her eye in for the second and takes a couple of runs with a nice chip past mid-wicket. Time for drinks.     2.48am    13th over: New Zealand 42-5 (Amy Satterthwaite 8, Katey Martin 6) Interestingly, Australia\u2019s run score was almost identical at the 13th-over mark of their innings. They had 44. The main difference, of course, is that they were 44-1.     2.46am    12th over: New Zealand 41-5 (Amy Satterthwaite 7, Katey Martin 6) I can hardly keep up. Mackay fell in the first ball of this over and before it is out Katey Martin, who has literally just come to the crease, is given out for lbw. But this one too is reviewed and successfully. There was bat on that, she\u2019s edged it (just), and is safe for now. Mind you, she\u2019d just hit Brown for four on her second ball and stole a quick two runs two balls thereafter, which is more to say than her preceding teammates.     2.43am   Wicket! Mackay 1 lbw b Brown  This is dire. Dire straits. Darcie Brown, the sultan of swing, opts for one straight down the middle that smashes Mackay in the pads and looks plumb. Umpire calls lbw but New Zealand don\u2019t think so \u2013 or they are just desperate \u2013 and review it. It\u2019s pad first and line is good.      2.39am   Wicket! Green 3 c Healy b McGrath  11th over: New Zealand 35-4 (Amy Satterthwaite 7, Frances Mackay 1) Tahlia McGrath makes her way up for her first over of the innings and it takes her a measly four balls to exert her influence and take another wicket. It\u2019s regulation, too, a seamer that Green pokes outside off-stump and Healy is there for an easy catch. Frances Mackay walks out just in time for Satterthwaite to pump a four.     2.33am    10th over: New Zealand 29-3 (Amy Satterthwaite 2, Maddy Green 3) Brown looks to be on her way to a maiden over to Green until the latter drives through extra cover for two. Before that she was forced to defend mainly. Brown has conceded 11 runs and taken two wickets from five overs. Power play is over as of now. At this point in Australia\u2019s innings they had lost one wicket. For the Kiwis it is three.     2.29am    9th over: New Zealand 27-3 (Amy Satterthwaite 2, Maddy Green 1) Looks windy out there. The broadcasters are doing their broadcasting thing and zooming in on trees swaying in the breeze. A strategically placed camera also captures an ICC flag fluttering around. The punters on the hill don\u2019t seem to mind the windy Welly conditions. Undoubtedly they are more concerned with what is happening on the field. Perry bowls an over featuring one single apiece for Satterthwaite and Green.     2.26am   Wicket! Bates 16 c McGrath b Brown  8th over: New Zealand 25-3 (Amy Satterthwaite 1, Maddy Green 0) Will this turn into a collapse of all proportions? I don\u2019t want to be presumptive, but the pressure appears to be getting to the White Ferns. Bates tries a pull shot, presumably to break the run drought of the past few overs. She does it despite being crowded by Brown\u2019s barrelling, shortish delivery. It catches the top edge and McGrath is at mid-wicket waiting for it. It\u2019s Maddy Green\u2019s turn.     2.20am    7th over: New Zealand 24-2 (Suzie Bates 16, Amy Satterthwaite 0) The Kiwis are on the back foot, figuratively and literally \u2013 Australia\u2019s attack are not giving an inch. Brown has no interest in leaking cheap runs and she gives only a quick single to Bates in this over.     2.16am   Wicket! Amelia Kerr 1 c Mooney b Brown  6th over: New Zealand 23-2 (Suzie Bates 15, Amy Satterthwaite 0) What a catch from Mooney! That rivals Green\u2019s from earlier in the day. Brown is on song and again at a good length Kerr wraps her hands around her bat and drives hard, but Mooney is at second slip with an outstretched arm and a hand that does not make a mistake. Gone for one. NZ are surely in deep you know what right now. Amy Satterthwaite is up and gives Brown four dot balls to open her innings.     2.12am   Wicket! Devine 6 b Perry  5th over: New Zealand 23-1 (Suzie Bates 15, Amelia Kerr 1) Devine has her first boundary! She was superb in the World Cup warm-up match against Australia and this is the first sign in this one of what she can do. But she ain\u2019t gonna get the chance this time. Perry bowls wide of the crease and the ball curves in. Bates is caught out by the smart delivery and her own indecision, beaten on the inside edge as the ball hits the leg stump. Big wicket for Australia. Right-hander Amelia Kerr makes her way out to the crease.  Updated at 2.13am GMT    2.05am    4th over: New Zealand 18-0 (Suzie Bates 15, Sophie Devine 2) Brown is having a field day with the new ball. Her line and length is on point and that late swing is causing issues, beating the outside edge. The batter finds herself a little crowded on the penultimate ball but still manages a chip with enough momentum for two runs, and repeats the feat with a confident pull stepping up to a shorter ball.     2.02am    3rd over: New Zealand 13-0 (Suzie Bates 11, Sophie Devine 1) Perry pitches slightly short and a little wide allows Bates to bat straight, and straight she does bat through extra cover for a four. Mixed over from Bates, who judged a couple well but also mistimed a cut off a length delivery.     1.58am    2nd over: New Zealand 7-0 (Suzie Bates 5, Sophie Devine 1) Devine is off the mark facing a full-tossing Darcey Brown. No Megan Schutt to start in the bowling, interesting. Brown\u2019s next ball is flawless and draws flaws from Bates, who is lured into an attempted drive which she clean misses as the ball swings late and violently away.     1.53am    1st over: New Zealand 3-0 (Suzie Bates 3, Sophie Devine 0) Thanks Megan and hello all. Well Gardner finished off Australia\u2019s innings in excellent fashion as New Zealand slipped a little off the pedestal they\u2019d occupied throughout much of their opponents\u2019 innings. It\u2019s not an easy target, 270. What can they do? Bates and Devine are at the crease, the former is on strike. Perry opens the attack, kicking off with an inswinging full toss. A couple of dot balls are followed by a wide. Bates is late to the next delivery but the one after that is a cracker of a drive that yields three runs as McGrath chases it down just shy of the boundary.  Updated at 1.54am GMT    1.26am    Well thank you so much for joining me for the first innings of this key match. I\u2019m handing over to Emma Kemp now who will take you through New Zealand\u2019s batting innings. Paul Cockburn has noted via email that it\u2019s usually popular to bat first at the Basin, so maybe that will come into play later on. Hope you enjoy the rest of the match - I\u2019ll be back to cover another match with you soon!     1.23am   Australia 269-8  It was a very strong finish from Australia and New Zealand will be disappointed they lost control late in the innings. But they have some big hitting power and this score certainly isn\u2019t out of their reach. Australia will remember their warm up game where they set NZ a score over 300 and weren\u2019t able to defend it. Australia need to take wickets early and regularly if they hope to win this game. It\u2019s certainly a game that can go either way at this point and the way both teams start the next innings will be crucial.     1.19am    50th over: Australia 269-8 (Ash Gardner 48, Megan Schutt 0) And of course it\u2019s Tahuhu to bowl the final over, NZ will be hoping she can keep this score in check. It\u2019s a good start with Wellington run out early, but Gardner can\u2019t be contained and she takes two boundaries from the next two balls. Tahuhu beats her on the next ball and Gardner can\u2019t get bat on it. She hits the next one straight in the air and it should be a simple catch for Rowe, but she has too much time to think about it and fumbles it. Gardner punishes her with a six next ball.     1.16am   WICKET! Amanda-Jade Wellington 1 run out Mackay, Australia 253-8  A great underarm throw from Mackay gets Wellington out trying to grab a quick single.  Updated at 1.29am GMT    1.13am    49th over: Australia 253-7 (Ash Gardner 32, Amanda-Jade Wellington 0) Rowe comes on to bowl the penultimate over and Gardner takes her on right away, but it doesn\u2019t quite reach the boundary this time. Gardner keeps going though and a few balls later strikes a six straight down the ground and follows it up with a second consecutive six. Rowe bounces back with two excellent short balls that she dug in really well and forces Gardner to take her first two dot balls.      1.09am    48th over: Australia 239-7 (Ash Gardner 19, Amanda-Jade Wellington 0) Tahuhu is back for this over, but Gardner isn\u2019t intimidated, getting on strike on the second ball and immediately hitting it back over Tahuhu\u2019s head for an impressive six. King tries to do the same a couple of balls later, but she doesn\u2019t get hold of it and she has to go for two.      1.08am   WICKET! Alana King c Bates b Tahuhu, Australia 238-7  King tries to hit a big one back over the bowler\u2019s head, but she doesn\u2019t get all of it and Bates takes another simple catch, which is almost thwarted by her own teammate, but she holds on to it.     1.04am    47th over: Australia 229-6 (Ash Gardner 11, Alana King 1) Gardner doesn\u2019t even need one ball to get her eye in against Rowe, she just cuts one deftly for four immediately, then follows it up with a tidy single. McGrath sends one straight to Bates and brings Alana King to the crease. King nearly gives her wicket up immediately, hitting it straight back to Rowe, but she can\u2019t hold on.   Updated at 1.05am GMT    1.02am   WICKET! Tahlia McGrath 57 c Bates b Rowe, Australia 229-6  McGrath needed to keep pushing forward, but unfortunately she can\u2019t get this one past the field and Bates takes a simple catch.     1.00am    46th over: Australia 224-5 (Ash Gardner 6, Tahlia McGrath 57) Gardner establishes herself quickly and gets off the mark with a front foot drive for four. Straight out of Covid isolation and into the fire she moves quickly and keeps the pace up well.     12.57am    45th over: Australia 214-5 (Ash Gardner 0, Tahlia McGrath 53) Brilliant fielding from Tahuhu from her own bowling cuts off an almost certain four and keeps it to a dot. McGrath nearly takes out Perry a few balls later, but Perry ducks out of the way well and they bring up their 100 partnership next ball. But then Tahuhu takes Perry with a stunning catch and the game changes again.     12.56am   WICKET! Ellyse Perry 68 c Green b Tahuhu, Australia 214-5  It looked like a brilliant shot from Perry but Green came out of nowhere to sail through the air Deandra Dottin style to take a stunning catch.     12.51am    44th over: Australia 211-4 (Ellyse Perry 67, Tahlia McGrath 51) New Zealand is getting a little worried by Australia\u2019s acceleration as they race past 200. There is plenty for Sophie Devine to consider in how she finishes this innings out with her bowlers. Their plan to frustrate worked well early, but these two batters are feeling very much at ease now and aren\u2019t as susceptible to the frustration and pressure. They need to take one or both of these wickets to get back into the game and finish on a high.  Updated at 12.51am GMT    12.50am   50 for Tahlia McGrath  A great little knock from McGrath to save the innings when it looked like it was in big trouble.     12.47am    43rd over: Australia 199-4 (Ellyse Perry 64, Tahlia McGrath 42) Tahuhu is back and she tempts Perry into a wild shot, but it falls safely with no fielders around. Tahuhu is throwing in a few short balls and coming over the wicket to the right hander and forcing Perry to playing a bit more cautiously after that big shot. She then tempts a big shot from McGrath that gets top edge, but again it falls safely and this time races away to the boundary for four.      12.43am    42nd over: Australia 192-4 (Ellyse Perry 62, Tahlia McGrath 37) Amelia Kerr doesn\u2019t offer quite as many opportunities to the batters, but McGrath finds one late in the over with a big sweep to the boundary. There\u2019s a definite increase in intensity late in this innings.     12.40am    41st over: Australia 184-4 (Ellyse Perry 59, Tahlia McGrath 32) McGrath is upping the intent now, starting Jess Kerr\u2019s over with two fours. She can see the need for the run rate to increase into the last ten overs. Perry joins the party and brings up her fifty with a four, followed by a six from the free hit. It\u2019s a huge over - 20 runs from it.     12.39am   50 for Ellyse Perry  Perry gets a gift with a high full toss and she puts it away for four and brings up her half century.     12.36am    40th over: Australia 164-4 (Ellyse Perry 49, Tahlia McGrath 23) Perry is timing the ball really well but most of the time it isn\u2019t paying off in a big way. Her strike rate is well below where it could be on the basis of what some of these shots look like.      12.32am    39th over: Australia 159-4 (Ellyse Perry 46, Tahlia McGrath 22) The over starts with an excellent piece of fielding from Suzie Bates who cuts off an almost certain four from McGrath and restricts her to one. McGrath isn\u2019t deterred pulls out a brilliant straight drive that can\u2019t be cut off by the field two balls later.      12.30am    38th over: Australia 152-4 (Ellyse Perry 44, Tahlia McGrath 16) A chance early in the over, but it falls just short of Maddy Green. They play a little more cautiously after that but a big swing from McGrath late in the over brings about an appeal - Martin is convinced there\u2019s bat involved, but the review proves that it was clear. McGrath finishes with a single.     12.24am    37th over: Australia 148-4 (Ellyse Perry 43, Tahlia McGrath 14) Perry picks up three runs from Jensen straight away and then there are a few more singles from the over, but they\u2019ll be wanting to step up the boundaries.     12.20am    36th over: Australia 142-4 (Ellyse Perry 39, Tahlia McGrath 12) Now we get Jess Kerr back in the attack, picking up where she left off with her length balls. She played a big role in setting up the frustration of the Australian batters from the start and she continues that role in this over.     12.17am    35th over: Australia 140-4 (Ellyse Perry 38, Tahlia McGrath 11) McGrath starts with a four of her own against Jensen, driving it past long on to the boundary. She gets Perry back on strike immediately afterwards and she plays a nicely timed shot for one straight away. Plenty of nice shots this over, well-timed and good running but they will want to pick the speed up.     12.13am    34th over: Australia 133-4 (Ellyse Perry 37, Tahlia McGrath 5) Perry plays a straight drive back past Kerr for four in the middle of the over but can\u2019t get more runs away from Kerr.      12.11am    33rd over: Australia 128-4 (Ellyse Perry 33, Tahlia McGrath 4) McGrath gets away a nice shot against Rowe, but Amelia Kerr pulls out some excellent fielding to cut it off. Rowe gives away an unnecessary wide with a short ball, before dragging her length back. Australia are rotating the strike, but need to start moving quickly to get their run rate up before they close out their innings.      12.06am    32nd over: Australia 122-4 (Ellyse Perry 29, Tahlia McGrath 3) Kerr\u2019s first ball is good, but the second is looser and Perry punishes it immediately with a boundary. Kerr is good enough to adjust and follows up with a dot and a single to bring McGrath on strike. The Australians rotate the strike well through the over and are slowly pushing the run rate up.     12.01am    31st over: Australia 116-4 (Ellyse Perry 24, Tahlia McGrath 2) McGrath gets her first look at Rowe and takes her time getting a look at what she\u2019s doing with the ball. She picks up a single from the fourth and then Rowe throws in a nice change of pace to stop Perry charging down the wicket at her.     11.57pm    30th over: Australia 114-4 (Ellyse Perry 23, Tahlia McGrath 1) Kerr strikes immediately and brings McGrath to the crease, continuing with that excellent flight to build the pressure through four dot balls before McGrath manages a single from the last.     11.55pm   WICKET! Beth Mooney 30 b A Kerr, Australia 113-4  Kerr strikes immediately in her fifth over with a length ball outside off stump taking Mooney\u2019s stumps down.     11.53pm    29th over: Australia 113-3 (Ellyse Perry 23, Beth Mooney 29) Devine has used six bowlers so far, without bowling herself, so there are plenty of options there. Rowe starts this over with a wide before Perry brings up the 50 run partnership with a nice looking cut shot for a single. Mooney overs up a little chance, chipping one up, but it sails safely past the fielder. A quick single brings about a run out chance, but the throw is just wide from Amelia Kerr. Mooney uses the pace of the ball to steer the ball down past third for four late in the over to ease some more of the pressure.     11.49pm    28th over: Australia 104-3 (Ellyse Perry 21, Beth Mooney 24) Kerr is getting some really good flight through the air and gives away just two runs from the over.     11.47pm    27th over: Australia 102-3 (Ellyse Perry 20, Beth Mooney 23) Rowe comes back into the attack, having changed ends, and gives away three singles and then finishes with three dots.     11.42pm    26th over: Australia 99-3 (Ellyse Perry 19, Beth Mooney 21) It\u2019s fair to say this probably wasn\u2019t the score Australia was envisioning at the halfway mark in their innings, but Mooney and Perry are doing their best to get them back into a winning position. A review for a stumping early in Kerr\u2019s over, but Mooney is safe and she plays out a couple of balls before dashing down for a quick single. Perry finishes the over with caution.     11.38pm    25th over: Australia 97-3 (Ellyse Perry 19, Beth Mooney 20) Perry is finding her groove now and a very nicely played sweep shot goes straight to the boundary for four and she follows it up with another four before taking a single and giving the strike to Mooney. A straight drive beats Mackay and Mooney is able to rotate the strike back to Perry.      11.35pm    24th over: Australia 87-3 (Ellyse Perry 10, Beth Mooney 19) Mooney and Perry are getting some good shots away against Kerr, but Kerr is bowling well to her field and there aren\u2019t any boundaries on offer. However they are taking advantage of playing on a big ground by running twos whenever they can.     11.32pm    23rd over: Australia 83-3 (Ellyse Perry 9, Beth Mooney 16) Perry immediately gets off strike against Mackay and then Mooney finds some space, cutting one to deep backward point for two. There\u2019s a little bit more urgency in the running now approaching the halfway mark of the innings with the run rate still sitting well below four.      11.30pm    22nd over: Australia 79-3 (Ellyse Perry 8, Beth Mooney 13) Our first look at Amelia Kerr for this match and she starts with a full toss. But she gets away with it and Perry sends it straight to the field. It\u2019s a solid first over from her, with just a single from the last ball.      11.27pm    21st over: Australia 78-3 (Ellyse Perry 7, Beth Mooney 13) A little drop and run from Mooney on the first ball of Mackay\u2019s next over. A few little singles keep the runs going but then Mackay bowls one too full and Perry is able to take advantage and gets her first boundary, before following up with a single.     11.24pm    20th over: Australia 70-3 (Ellyse Perry 1, Beth Mooney 11) The Tahuhu v Mooney battle continues and Tahuhu continues to come over the wicket to the left hander, which has been working so well for her so far. She varies the length on the fourth with a good short ball that Mooney has to duck under. Tahuhu tries another on the final ball of the over, but it\u2019s called a wide and then Mooney is able to take a single to finish on the following ball.     11.20pm    19th over: Australia 68-3 (Ellyse Perry 1, Beth Mooney 10) Mackay is back after her wicket of Healy earlier in the match and Mooney gets one away for a single straight away. Perry is still watchful, she doesn\u2019t appear to be in a hurry to score quickly and plays out five dots.     11.17pm    18th over: Australia 67-3 (Ellyse Perry 1, Beth Mooney 9) Tahuhu starts around the wicket again and it\u2019s a very similar delivery to the one that got Haynes, but this one flies just over the stumps. Mooney gets bat on the second delivery, but her shot is cut off by some excellent fielding from Satterthwaite. She\u2019s not giving Mooney much at all this over, continuing the plan to frustrate that has been working so effectively so far. She concedes just one run from the over.     11.13pm    17th over: Australia 66-3 (Ellyse Perry 1, Beth Mooney 8) Mooney isn\u2019t mucking around, she doesn\u2019t want to take too long to settle here. She starts this over with a confident straight drive for four against Jensen and follows it up with a two. These two are very good athletes and well matched in speed, so they will take the extra runs whenever they see them on offer. Jensen takes a breath and tightens it back up after some looser deliveries to start, but then gives away two wides just as she\u2019s finding her form again. She finishes with a dot after all that.     11.07pm    16th over: Australia 57-3 (Ellyse Perry 1, Beth Mooney 1) A brilliant start from Tahuhu to this over with the Haynes wicket first ball to bring Mooney to the crease. NZ now have the benefit of bowling at two new batters and unsettling them before they have a chance to find their feet out here. Of course that is no easy task against two of the world\u2019s best batters in Perry and Mooney, but NZ will take any win they can against the world number one. It\u2019s a great over from NZ, with only one run from it.     11.04pm   WICKET! Rachael Haynes 30 b Tahuhu, Australia 56-3  A sensational ball from Tahuhu nips back in at the stumps and there\u2019s very little Haynes can do but watch as her stumps crumble behind her.  Updated at 1.28am GMT    11.03pm    15th over: Australia 56-2 (Ellyse Perry 1, Rachael Haynes 30) Jensen starts with a couple of dots and Lanning is getting impatient. A wild swing on the third ball sends her on her way and brings Ellyse Perry to the crease. Jensen doesn\u2019t give Perry much to work with to start her innings, continuing with her frustrating line and length, but Perry and Haynes are able to rotate the strike for the last couple of balls.  Updated at 11.08pm GMT    10.59pm   WICKET! Meg Lanning 5 c Martin b Jensen, Australia 54-2  The White Ferns are doing a brilliant job in their plan to frustrate the batters. Jensen had been so consistent after her less than perfect start and tempted Lanning to swing at one outside off stump and send a top edge to Martin.     10.56pm    14th over: Australia 54-1 (Meg Lanning 5, Rachael Haynes 29) A bit of a wild looking delivery from Tahuhu to start the over, but Haynes can\u2019t quite get hold of it and it doesn\u2019t get past the fielders. But Tahuhu drops the next one in short and Haynes is ready, pulling it confidently to the boundary for four. She takes a single from the next ball and Tahuhu finds her length a bit more easily to Lanning, who plays out a dot and then rotates the strike back to Haynes, who finishes the over with yet another pull shot for four.     10.52pm    13th over: Australia 44-1 (Meg Lanning 4, Rachael Haynes 20) Jensen starts with another good length ball, but loses control of the second to send it for a wide that is nicely cleaned up by Martin. She finds her line and length again and cramps Haynes up, not giving her any opportunity to get the ball past the field. Finally she gets her opportunity on the last ball of the over, but it\u2019s just a single.     10.47pm    12th over: Australia 42-1 (Meg Lanning 4, Rachael Haynes 19) Mackay gets a rest after her big wicket and Lea Tahuhu comes in with two slips in play in an attacking field. Lannintg drives one down through deep extra cover for two and follows up with a single. She seems determined not to take too long to get into her innings and put herself in the position Healy found herself in where she felt the need to go big to speed up the run rate.      10.43pm    11th over: Australia 38-1 (Meg Lanning 1, Rachael Haynes 18) Jensen continues and starts with five dots to the Australian captain. Jensen has settled into her line and length a bit better now and is getting her field in better position as well. At last Lanning finds one that she likes and sneaks it past the field for a single.     10.40pm    10th over: Australia 37-1 (Meg Lanning 0, Rachael Haynes 18) The Australians start with a very quick single, followed by a dot and then another very quick single. They look like they\u2019re getting into their groove now, but Healy tries to go too big too soon and gives away her wicket. Lanning comes to the crease and aims to steady the ship.     10.39pm   WICKET! Alyssa Healy 15 c A Kerr b Mackay, Australia 37-1  A mis-timed slog from Healy proves her downfall and she sends an easy catch to Amelia Kerr at deep mid-wicket.     10.36pm    9th over: Australia 35-0 (Alyssa Healy 14, Rachael Haynes 17) Hayley Jensen comes in to bowl now and starts with a wide, but isn\u2019t deterred. Her next delivery is still a little leg side-ish but Haynes just takes a single from it and gives Jensen a look at Healy. Healy plays out a couple of dots to get her eye in and then flicks a ball to fine leg for a single. Jensen gives away a no ball late in the over and offers up a free hit to Haynes, but her line and length are good enough that she\u2019s not punished for it. However the very next ball Haynes opens up with a lovely pull shot that is misfielded by Rowe and goes over the boundary for four.     10.31pm    8th over: Australia 27-0 (Alyssa Healy 13, Rachael Haynes 12) Frankie Mackay comes into the attack now and Haynes immediately gets her away for a single. Healy plays her more cautiously, feeling her way in with the new bowler and plays out five dots.     10.27pm    7th over: Australia 26-0 (Alyssa Healy 13, Rachael Haynes 11) Jess Kerr starts the over with a wide - the first of the match - but doesn\u2019t let the over get away from her and gets straight back into her in-swinging, full deliveries that have proved so hard to score from. Haynes looks to be in an attacking mindset, always looking for runs as soon as she makes contact with the ball, but Kerr ensures they\u2019re hard to come by. Healy finishes the over with a confident boundary from a front foot flick over fine leg.     10.23pm    6th over: Australia 20-0 (Alyssa Healy 9, Rachael Haynes 10) Healy finds a bit more space against Rowe immediately and picks up three runs to start the over and Haynes follows it up with with a nicely timed drive to almost make it to the boundary, but some superb fielding from NZ keeps it to two runs. Rowe has been a bit loose with her early deliveries, but she pulls her line back late in the over with three dots to finish.     10.18pm    5th over: Australia 14-0 (Alyssa Healy 6, Rachael Haynes 8) Jess Kerr is finding some beautiful length this over and Haynes is doing her best to dig the ball out, but hasn\u2019t been able to get it past the field early in the over. Kerr maintains her line and length and finishes with a valuable maiden.     10.15pm    4th over: Australia 14-0 (Alyssa Healy 6, Rachael Haynes 8) Close to a wicket from the first ball of this over from Rowe as Healy flirts with a ball outside off, but misses edging it to the keeper. She plays out one more dot ball, before two quick singles for each of the batters to keep the strike rotating. It\u2019s a nice, tight over from Rowe, but NZ will be looking to take a wicket soon and not let these two settle into the game.     10.11pm    3rd over: Australia 12-0 (Alyssa Healy 5, Rachael Haynes 7) Jess Kerr continues and Healy starts with a confident stroke, but it can\u2019t beat the field. Katey Martin comes up to the stumps to try to cramp Healy up a bit, but it doesn\u2019t pay off and she immediately opens her scoring with a boundary past long on. It\u2019s an interesting battle between the two teams so far - still plenty of dot balls, but Healy and Haynes are making sure to not the let the pressure build too much with regular scoring.     10.07pm    2nd over: Australia 7-0 (Alyssa Healy 0, Rachael Haynes 7) Hannah Rowe opens from the other end and her first ball is a bit too straight and Haynes flicks it past fine leg for the first boundary of the match. Rowe tightens it up and pulls back the scoring with five dots - a very similar pattern to the previous over.      10.04pm    1st over: Australia 3-0 (Alyssa Healy 0, Rachael Haynes 3) Jess Kerr opening the bowling for NZ, with the breeze behind her. A good start from Haynes and aggressive running right from the start to get off the mark with three. Healy is more guarded and cautious against the in-swing of Kerr, playing out five dots to start her innings.      9.48pm    A very interesting line up from Australia, who have gone with their two leg spinners in Alana King and Amanda-Jade Wellington for this one. This means Jess Jonassen misses out, but Ash Gardner has returned from Covid isolation to add some off spin to the attack. On the batting side of things, Australia will be hoping for a repeat performance from Alyssa Healy who scored an impressive 72 against Pakistan. Australia bat deep, with even King at eight capable of smashing some quick runs. So they will be looking to put on a big score in this first innings and take the game out of New Zealand\u2019s reach before they even pick up their bats.     9.39pm   New Zealand XI   Sophie Devine (c) Suzie Bates Amelia Kerr Amy Satterthwaite Maddy Green Frances Mackay Katey Martin (wk) Hayley Jensen Lea Tahuhu Jess Kerr Hannah Rowe      9.38pm   Australia XI  Alyssa Healy (wk) Rachael Haynes Meg Lanning (c) Ellyse Perry Beth Mooney Tahlia McGrath Ashleigh Gardner Alana King Amanda-Jade Wellington Megan Schutt Darcie Brown      9.37pm   New Zealand win the toss  New Zealand have won the toss and chosen to bowl. No surprises there, if you win the toss against Meg Lanning, you make her do what she\u2019s not comfortable with.      9.35pm   Preamble  Good morning everyone! It\u2019s been a fascinating World Cup so far, so many twists in the tale and fascinating finishes. The West Indies have been the surprise packet in the early rounds, however a heavy loss to India - who look to be finding their form at last - will hurt. England are in some serious trouble after starting with two straight losses and will need to get back on their feet very quickly. But today we have a classic Trans-Tasman battle between these two old foes - Australia and New Zealand. The warm up game the two teams played revealed some weaknesses in Australia, with the inability to take wickets proving their undoing. New Zealand started the tournament with a shock loss to the West Indies but have bounced back since then with two strong wins over Bangaldesh and India. It should be an incredible game today, so let\u2019s get into it!  "

                    "body": "While Great Britain will begin the Billie Jean King Cup finals in Glasgow as clear underdogs, members of the team have asserted intentions of fighting for a spot in the semi-finals, which would be one of the biggest achievements of their careers. \u201cIt would be one of the biggest [achievements],\u201d said Katie Boulter. \u201cI feel I\u2019ve had a few in the past in Fed Cup and to add more to my memory would be pretty special.\u201d  The Billie Jean King Cup finals will see 12 teams compete for the title at the Emirates Arena in Glasgow, with four round-robin groups of three producing four semi-finalists. The United States team, which boasts Coco Gauff and Madison Keys, and the Czech Republic, led by Barbora Krejcikova and Karolina Pliskova, will begin the event as favourites. Britain have been drawn with Kazakhstan and Spain, with their first tie on Tuesday evening against a Kazakhstan team that boasts the Wimbledon champion, Elena Rybakina. They will attempt to reach the round robin stage without British No 1 Emma Raducanu, who withdrew due to a wrist injury. The squad is headed by singles players Harriet Dart, Boulter and Heather Watson, plus specialist doubles team Olivia Nicholls and Alicia Barnett. While Dart will be GB\u2019s No 1 player, it is Boulter who played a pivotal role in Britain\u2019s dramatic victory against Kazakhstan in the Copper Box in 2019 that secured promotion, winning one of the singles matches against Zarina Diyas. But it also came at a personal cost as she competed with a stress fracture in her back that took her months to recover from. \u201cIt\u2019s something that\u2019s in my core memory and I won\u2019t ever forget that one,\u201d said Boulter. \u201cSo I will hopefully use it and it was something that was pretty special to me. I think I can speak for everyone by saying it was something that was iconic, and I hope that we can replicate something like that.\u201d During previous BJK Cup ties, the British team have often built team spirit with their own murder mystery game among other things. This year, though, aside from an array of jokes from Watson and Nicholls along with their impressive Australian accents, captain Anne Keothavong says that the preparation has been all business. \u201cQuite frankly, for us as a team to have this opportunity, we do feel very fortunate, the fact that we are the host nation,\u201d Keothavong said. \u201cIt would be amazing. I think for those of us who were at Copper Box, that\u2019s a memory that we created as a team that will stay with us for the rest of our life. \u201cIf we can recreate more moments like that, I think that would be something special, not just individually but as a team and for British tennis, because it\u2019s certainly something we want more of.\u201d"

I think theres\u2019s still plenty in it, that far end is going to be interesting by the end. It\u2019s had a full day of sunshine and wind on it. We\u2019re going to try and get as many as possible in this first innings and when we do bowl its about being patience, I think its going to be about being attritional.\u201d That\u2019s it from me, thanks for all the messages and sorry I didn\u2019t get to them all. We\u2019re back tomorrow - see you then! Good night.     9.35pm   Close of play: England 268-6 (Bairstow 109, Woakes 24)  86th over: England 268-6 (Bairstow 109, Woakes 24) With a dash into the legside, the fifty partnership comes up in 96 balls and there\u2019s a stat on Sky about Bairstow and England and fifty partnerships which I don\u2019t quite catch but I think is impressive. Oh and that\u2019s gorgeous from Woakes, he dips the knee and sends the ball flying through extra cover for four. Seales rubs his hands and shakes his head in disappointment. Here\u2019s the last ball of the day: defended with aplomb, straight back down the pitch by Woakes. He and Bairstow hug, Brathwaite doles out a hug too, and Holder, in fact nearly all the West Indies team line up to bump fists. Bairstow grins the broadest of grins, and as he walks off is greeted by a smiling Joe Root.  Updated at 9.39pm GMT    9.29pm    85th over: England 263-6 (Bairstow 108, Woakes 20) Holder beats Woakes; Woakes flicks him past the diving man at midwicket for two. An over to go.      9.25pm    84th over: England 261-6 (Bairstow 108, Woakes 18) Woakes orders the ball to the cover boundary, and the ball obliges.  \u201cGood evening Tanya! \u201cHello Kim Thonger.\u201cAbsorbing stuff. Good old fashioned gutsy innings from Bairstow. Reminds me of Colin Milburn for some reason. I\u2019d have liked to see them bat together. But watching Stokes with Sobers or Root with Richards would have been wonderful too. Surely the quantum wizards and witches who run the simulation in which we \u2018live\u2019 could make it happen?\u201d     9.21pm    83rd over: England 253-6 (Bairstow 107, Woakes 13)This is dragging on because of the slow over rate by the way, I think close of play is at 9.30 GMT, whatever number the overs have ticked on to. A leg-bye and a single off Roach.     9.19pm    82nd over: England 253-6 (Bairstow 106, Woakes 13) Seales unleashes an absolute beauty which beats Bairstow, but he picks ups a couple next ball with a stand and swing. In the stands Andrew Strauss is staring intensely at his phone as the early strains of Neil Diamond are pumped around the ground..     9.13pm    81st over: England 251-6 (Bairstow 104, Woakes 13) A single trumpet echoes over the stadium and clouds start to gather over the pavilion. Fluffy ones. Kemar Roach has the new ball and the first delivery boomerangs in, but Bairstow is equal to it. Woakes picks up three through midwicket.      9.08pm    80th over: England 245-6 (Bairstow 101, Woakes 10) Nothing much to say about those six balls, it all about what happens next. An email arrives from Andrew Benton:\u201cDid the Guardian do anything special to celebrate women\u2019s day today for its contributors? I see you didn\u2019t get the day off ! But cricket on telly has been pretty good at mixing up the commentaries it seems - men and women commenting on men and women\u2019s. It\u2019s so much nicer to watch, much better balanced. \u201c I agree, TV has shown the way, and it felt so natural so quickly.      9.03pm    79th over: England 245-6 (Bairstow 101, Woakes 10) Some pleasingly binary scores there. One over to the second new ball.      9.01pm   Hundred for Jonny Bairstow!  78th over: England 241-6 (Bairstow 101, Woakes 6) A leap, a double-clenched salute, a ginger roar! Bairstow goes to his hundred with a sweeping dismissal of Brathwaite\u2019s lobbing temptation. A smashing innings that recast the innings. Fisher brings the end of over drinks and victory banana out to his Yorkshire teammate - a nice touch.   Updated at 9.04pm GMT    8.53pm    77th over: England 235-6 (Bairstow 96, Woakes 5) The new ball is available in three overs. Will Jonny want those three figures safely in his pocket by then? Woakes plays out a Joseph over to the sleepy sounds of a day drawing to a close. Thank you so much Gareth Wilson for finding the article that I couldn\u2019t quite place: the not-so-nervous nineties.      8.50pm    76th over: England 235-6 (Bairstow 96, Woakes 5) Just a single off the remarkable, miserly, Holder.  \u201cHello Tanya,\u201d Good evening Geoff Wignall! \u201cThat was an interesting email from Robert Wilson but he\u2019s a bit harsh on Collingwood when there are so many other \u2018misfires and misfits\u2019 from whom to choose who didn\u2019t manage a 40 plus average and weren\u2019t worth at least an extra 10 for their fielding. PS the email link for you at the top of the OBO doesn\u2019t seem to work. It came up as merely freelance@\u201d Ahh....while I try to fix it, and in case anyone wants to get in touch, it is tanya.aldred.freelance@theguardian.com     8.47pm    75th over: England 233-6 (Bairstow 95, Woakes 4) Events! First Woakes nearly runs out Bairstow as Joseph (drops/brushes his fingers on the ball in his follow through) and the ball slams into the stumps (quick-stepping Bairstow is back in his crease) then he is dropped at second slip by Holder, then he squeaks one through the cordon for four. Woakes shakes his head and refuses to catch YJB\u2019s eye.     8.41pm    74th over: England 229-6 (Bairstow 95, Woakes 0) The cricketer to keep a cool head in a crisis bowls to the cricketer who bend spoons with his intensity. Ying smothers yang and it\u2019s a maiden. \u201cHello Tanya.\u201d Hello Tim Sanders! \u201cLovely stuff about Jonny from Robert Wilson. I beg only to differ on his judgement of Paul Collingwood who was a splendid, fighting Test cricketer who would block for ever, or unfurl his strokeplay, or a bit of both, as the game demanded.\u201d     8.37pm    73rdover: England 229-6 (Bairstow 95, Woakes 0) Joseph has the task of trying to curtail Bairstow, and he mostly does. No boundaries, but two fiercely run twos.      8.34pm    72nd over: England 224-6 (Bairstow 90, Woakes 0) Holder enquires politely after an lbw, but it\u2019s a no from the ump. A single eases Bairstow into the decade of doom (actually I think I once read something that said you weren\u2019t overly likely to get out in the nervous nineties).     8.29pm    71st over: England 222-6 (Bairstow 88, Woakes 0) Baristow greets Joseph with the air of a man who wants his dinner and wants it now. Short arm jab BOUNDARY, ANOTHER through backward point. Apparently, his last seven scoring shots have been boundaries, but he spits in the face of such stats and sprints two.  Exactly so.     8.24pm    70th over: England 214-6 (Bairstow 80, Woakes 0) So West Indies Mr unflappable makes the breakthrough, just as he did at the tail end of that already-slightly-hazy white-ball series.  This, by Robert Wilson, captures the essence of Bairstow: \u201cHey there. Hope the dawg is well. Also hoping Bairstow gets a ton. In a double decade of Test msifits and misfires (however amiable) like Eoin Morgan, Collingwood and the Buttler didn\u2019t do it, Bairstow has been Mark Waugh. He can properly bat. And has often proved it. His Test average should be a lot closer to his 1st-class one (mid-forties from memory). It\u2019s a mental game and he has some bad habits but he has been multiply humped in selection terms and that has got between his ears for years. \u201cIt makes me think of Talent\u2019s scatterbrained promiscuity, (and its innate sense of mischevious injustice). The God of Talent ladles out the gifts to two basic character types. Obviously to the Warnes, the riotously irresponsible, bibulous and randy wideboys who party for a couple of decades while nonchalantly breaking records set by the industrious and sincere. But also to the chartered accountants of sporting genius like Bradman. Where even the most egregious flair and aptitude are ground fine in the relentless war machine of one dedicated and charmless superego. \u201cMessi is an outlier. A definite accountant but imbued with so much laughably extreme grace and inspiration that he seems like some kind of angelic pickpocket or pirate.Poor old Bairstow is an outlier too. Because he\u2019s a mere human being. With a lot of skill and nous. We\u2019ve all helped grind it out of him.\u201d     8.19pm   WICKET! Foakes lbw Holder 42 (England 214-6)  And with the partnership tantalisingly teetering on 99, Foakes plays across the line to Holder\u2019s second ball. He reviews, hopefully, but no cigar. A reassuring and elegant innings for Foakes on his comeback. They take DRINKS with a tasty 50 minutes or so left in the day.    Updated at 8.25pm GMT    8.15pm    69th over: England 214-5 (Bairstow 80, Foakes 42) Two slog-sweeps and two more boundaries to YJB, who has the fire now.     8.12pm    68th over: England 205-5 (Bairstow 72, Foakes 41) Bairstow muscles a wide one over midwicket for four, and very next ball is a jaffa, a beauty, steaming off the pitch, kissing the inside edge, somehow missing the stumps before steaming to the rope..To add insult to injury for Roach, it is a no ball. A Jonny riposte follows, a short, sharp jab for four more.     8.07pm    67th over: England 192-5 (Bairstow 60, Foakes 41) Theses two seem to be taking it in turns to score. Foakes has the nod at the moment, with a couple through the covers then a tippy-toed one-two down the pitch and flick: into the on side and over the boundary.     8.03pm    66th over: England 185-5 (Bairstow 60, Foakes 35) Time for Roach to do some donkey work on this sleepy old pitch. Just a no-ball to add to the score.   So true.     7.59pm    65th over: England 185-5 (Bairstow 60, Foakes 35) Permaul shimmies through another, and just one to Bairstow.      7.56pm    64th over: England 184-5 (Bairstow 59, Foakes 35) West Indies look like getting the ball changed at last as the box of crimson goodies comes out, but it seems they\u2019ve ended up with the original. Seales, white sweat band on one wrist, watch on the other, glides his long legs to the crease. Foakes nurdles an over-pitched to the rope, next ball sends another down to long on. No sourness curdling his milk.     7.47pm   REVIEW- NOT OUT!  63rd over: England 176-5 (Bairstow 59, Foakes 27) Bairstow gets down on one knee to play an ugly old swipe and is appalled to be given out caught behind. The review shows air between bat and ball and Permaul loses a wicket from his analysis.      7.44pm    62nd over: England 176-5 (Bairstow 59, Foakes 27) Seales is full of beans, varying his length efffectively.     7.40pm    61st over: England 175-5 (Bairstow 58, Foakes 27) Permaul wheals through another, as a selection of light snacks arrive in the living room. Two to Foakes from a dab.     7.37pm    60th over: England 173-5 (Bairstow 58, Foakes 25) Jayden Seales returns, and Bairstow picks up a couple off his boot-caps. Lionel Richie balladeers over the sound system - I\u2019m guessing more for the benefit of the barmy army than any home supporters.     7.34pm    59th over: England 171-5 (Bairstow 56, Foakes 25) Four more, this time to Foakes, who had become becalmed on 21: a rather charming flurry to midwicket.  \u201cGood evening, Tanya.\u201d Bon soir Charles Lomas in Aulas. \u201cAs an aging pedestrian of somewhat limited mobility, I wish you would not use the word \u201cpedestrian\u201d in a pejorative sense. I walk slowly but I am not a long hop. You don\u2019t want to sound like David Gower.\u201d I consider myself chastised, though \u201cI walk slowly but am not a long hop\u201d is a fantastic first line for a riddle.     7.29pm    58th over: England 167-5 (Bairstow 56, Foakes 21) The game suddenly sparks into life, as YJB sizzles Joseph through backward point with a sizzle of insouciance. Two balls later he chops down a bit late and the inside edge flies, in spitting distance of his stumps. Two more come thanks to genuine sprinting back to the striker\u2019s end.     7.24pm   Fifty for Bairstow!  57th over: England 161-5 (Bairstow 50, Foakes 21) A wide one drifts from Permaul\u2019s hand and Bairstow pounces, slap-bang to the rope. Balcony appreciation from his teammates.    Updated at 7.38pm GMT    7.21pm    56th over: England 156-5 (Bairstow 46, Foakes 21) Bairstow survives a review, after being hit on the top of the pad by Joseph. An optimistic shout by West Indies - but Bairstow is starting to look cosy in his slippers - it was probably worth a go Like this strategy:.       7.16pm    55th over: England 155-5 (Bairstow 45, Foakes 21) Foakes navigates another Permaul over. I like Permaul\u2019s style, delivering from wide of the crease with a flamboyant arm and a touch of panache.   Updated at 7.23pm GMT    7.13pm    54th over: England 155-5 (Bairstow 45, Foakes 21) Sudden riches as Bairstow plunders ten from Joseph\u2019s over. A slash through a gap in the slips for four, a back foot steer through the covers for another and a determined sprint for two. Very nicely done.      7.10pm    53rd over: England 145-5 (Bairstow 35, Foakes 21) Yet another rapid maiden from Permaul.  Brian Withington is back! \u201cHow predictably tedious of BT to exhume the commentary stylings of David Gower - I guess we should just be grateful that they didn\u2019t extend the favour to the Bard of Brexit.\u201d Oh Brian, I have a to admit to a soft spot for Gower.  Updated at 7.10pm GMT    7.06pm    52nd over: England 145-5 (Bairstow 35, Foakes 21) Young Alzarri Joseph opens the post-tea session with a maiden. We glimpse a few seconds of the ocean, where a white-sailed yacht bobs up and down, the same wind that is billowing shirts on the field.     7.03pm    The players are out and we go again for the final session of the day.     7.03pm   CC Live! fantasty league  For all fans of county cricket, Mes has emailed in with details of a fantasty league for the 2022 season. If you\u2019re interested,  click here and use the code KNKTTEFN.     6.56pm    Pitch talk from David Gower: a bit of bounce, though not a hugely beneficial track for spinners.  You might recognise this crew:      6.49pm    Well, that\u2019s a much better scorecard for England to sup on than lunch\u2019s 57-4. Bairstow has now escorted England safely through two intervals in the stonewalling role. Foakes has been permitted to play his flair card.  \u201cFor a humble \u2018proper\u2019 wicketkeeper, Foakes looks disconcertingly decent with the bat,\u201d writes Brian Withington. \u201cBairstow also offering a more than passing imitation of a specialist red ball batsman - who would have thought he was worth persevering with?\u201d      6.42pm   Tea: England 145-5 (Bairstow 35, Foakes 21)  51st over: England 145-5 (Bairstow 35, Foakes 21) Runs! And four of them, as Foakes leans into Permaul\u2019s fourth ball, which lists onto the leg side, and sends the ball singing over the rope. And that\u2019s tea!     6.39pm    50th over: England 141-5 (Bairstow 35, Foakes 17) Kraigg Brathwaite\u2019s first ball of the match is a pedestrian sponge cake down the leg side which Bairstow regards snottily. His remaining five deliveries are more accurate but can\u2019t tempt Bairstow into something rash. A third maiden on the trot.      6.35pm    49th over: England 141-5 (Bairstow 35, Foakes 17) The umpires examine the ball, but it passes through the special cricketing circumference instruments and Permaul starts his second over with a touch of flair. Foakes pats him back, content to stagnate with tea not so long away.     6.32pm    48th over: England 141-5 (Bairstow 35, Foakes 17) Thank you Tim and for your forbearance over my slow puncture. Holder continues in the sun, while in the stands the camera pans to Sir Viv Richards in tight indigo jeans, looking in fine fettle. His fellow name on the trophy, Sir Ian Botham is also in town, clad in a more billowing shirt. A maiden.     6.29pm    47th over: England 141-5 (Bairstow 35, Foakes 17) It\u2019s Veerasammy Permaul, slow left-arm, and he bowls a tidy over for just a single. That\u2019s me done: on International Women\u2019s Day, it\u2019s high time I handed over to Tanya Aldred. Thanks for your company, your correspondence and your quips about the need for England to drop some more bowlers.     6.24pm    46th over: England 140-5 (Bairstow 34, Foakes 17) Foakes, facing Holder for the first time, keeps busy and flicks for two. We may be about to see some spin...  Updated at 6.25pm GMT    6.20pm    45th over: England 137-5 (Bairstow 33, Foakes 15) Back to the tussle between Foakes and Roach. It\u2019s less gripping this time but still see-sawing, as a nice busy cut for two is followed by a play-and-miss.      6.16pm    44th over: England 135-5 (Bairstow 33, Foakes 13) Seales gives way to Holder, who decides to home in on Bairstow\u2019s pads. His first attempt is too leg-side and goes for four leg-byes; his second brings a strangled appeal, and so does the third. Holder is back in the maidens: 9-6-7-1. \u201cStokes may be out,\u201d says Tom van der Gucht, \u201cbut on the plus side, Woakes is probably due a century.\u201d Ha. This slow pitch might suit him down to the ground.     6.10pm    43rd over: England 131-5 (Bairstow 33, Foakes 13) This over from Roach is a miniature rollercoaster. Foakes edges a fine away-swinger for four, between first and second slip, but short of both. Then he off-drives for four, handsomely. Then he plays and misses. And then he straight-drives for four more! He has raced to 13 off seven balls. Is he playing the innings we always expected from Jos Buttler?     6.05pm    42nd over: England 118-5 (Bairstow 33, Foakes 1) With Stokes gone, we have two right-handers at the crease, and two wicketkeepers. They take a single apiece off Seales as Ben Foakes, back from the wilderness, announces himself with a stylish on-drive, which Roach does well to half-stop at mid-on. \u201cI see,\u201d says Em Jackson, \u201cthe England side have appointed Roger Daltrey as today\u2019s guest coach. Our match tactics seemingly \u2018Meet the new boss, same as the old boss\u2019.\u201d  Updated at 6.05pm GMT    6.00pm    41st over: England 116-5 (Bairstow 32, Foakes 0) It\u2019s now up to Bairstow to hold England together, as he did in his last Test at Sydney, making 113 and 41 and singlehandedly seeing off the threat of an Ashes whitewash. Facing Roach, he goes back to being watchful, taking just a single off the last ball.     5.58pm    40th over: England 115-5 (Bairstow 31, Foakes 0) Stokes had just had another escape, nicking Seales just short of first slip, where John Campbell took it neatly on the half-volley. Stokes responded by smoking the next ball for four, and glancing the one after for four more. It looked as if the disappointment had got to Seales, but with the last ball of the over he dug deep and produced an inspired retort. Stokes battled hard and did well to add 67 with Bairstow, but England could still be skittled here.     5.56pm   Wicket!! Stokes b Seales 36 (England 115-5)  Big moment! Seales gets the breakthrough with a swinging yorker that Stokes can only drag onto his stumps.   Updated at 6.01pm GMT    5.51pm    39th over: England 107-4 (Stokes 28, Bairstow 31) Kemar Roach is back for his third spell. Bairstow treats him with due respect for five balls, then cashes in on a middle-stump half-volley and caresses it to the rope at midwicket. \u201cThat was beautifully timed,\u201d says Butcher.     5.48pm    How did you spend the drinks break? At the risk of being more Guardian than thou, I spent it looking at today\u2019s tweets from the Gender Pay Gap Bot, which has a great angle on International Women\u2019s Day.      5.44pm   Drinks: England in decent hour shock  38th over: England 103-4 (Stokes 28, Bairstow 27) Seales, bowling to Stokes, comes up with an intriguing ball - slanted across him and swinging back in so late that Stokes wonders if he should have played it and Josh da Silva has to change direction to take it. A very high-class dot. And that\u2019s drinks, with England (whisper it) winning the first hour after lunch, but still a long way from being out of the woods.  \u201cWe haven\u2019t had anyone out for a duck yet,\u201d says John Starbuck. \u201cThere must have been a time when a whole England innings was like that, but I\u2019ve no idea when. Barring commentator\u2019s curse, any suggestions?\u201d I\u2019m going to throw that one out to the OBO Massive.     5.38pm    37th over: England 103-4 (Stokes 28, Bairstow 27) Holder pulls himself together and delivers five dots before Stokes steals a quick single to mid-on, digging out a rare yorker.     5.35pm    36th over: England 102-4 (Stokes 27, Bairstow 27) Seales is back already, at the other end, but still being told off for his follow-through. (Give the kid a rest! Get the spinner on!) Stokes off-drives and gets only one for it as there\u2019s a fine diving stop, but it\u2019s enough to bring up the fifty partnership off 19.5 overs. The first six of those overs, as you\u2019ll remember, yielded just three runs. Bairstow celebrates \u2013 and brings up the hundred \u2013 with a cover drive for four, the sixth boundary these two have managed between them in 146 balls. Proper Test creekit.  Updated at 5.35pm GMT    5.29pm    35th over: England 97-4 (Stokes 26, Bairstow 23) Bairstow cuts, not for the first time, but it is the first time he\u2019s really got hold of it. Four more: poor old Holder has gone to pieces.     5.25pm   Stokes reprieved!  34th over: England 93-4 (Stokes 26, Bairstow 19) Stokes, facing Joseph, is missed at second slip! He mistimed a cut, got it off the toe-end of the bat and squirted it low to the left of Jason Holder \u2013 who didn\u2019t move. Either Holder didn\u2019t see it, or he was reeling from the blow of conceding a run.     5.20pm    33rd over: England 89-4 (Stokes 22, Bairstow 19) Jason Holder returns and you\u2019re not going to believe this, but he has conceded a run. In fact two of them, to a cut by Bairstow.     5.18pm    32nd over: England 87-4 (Stokes 22, Bairstow 17) Joseph continues, which is a surprise when he has the long arm of the law hovering over his footmarks. The batters find the gaps with three singles and a two, chopped into the covers by Stokes. \u201cFantastic work as ever with the OBO,\u201d says Oliver Smiddy. Thanks, but I get the feeling you\u2019re softening me up. \u201cGood to see New England is the same as Old England, minus our two best bowlers. I\u2019m looking forward to us having a proper keeper though for the first time in forever.\u201d Bit harsh on Jos Buttler, who only had one bad series that I remember. \u201cMight I solicit a plug please? I\u2019m cycling 100 miles with a bunch of colleagues to raise money for Smart Works, a UK charity which helps women find work by providing suitable clothing and coaching for interview. If any generous OBO readers would care to donate, they can do so here. My firm will match any donations so effectively they count double!\u201d From a glance at the Smart Works website, it looks as if The Big Give will match them too.     5.12pm    31st over: England 82-4 (Stokes 19, Bairstow 15) Jayden Seales keeps attracting the attention of Joel Wilson, inspecting his footmarks, but he doesn\u2019t appear to have had a warning yet. He manages a maiden with just a leg-bye to add to the total.     5.07pm    30th over: England 81-4 (Stokes 19, Bairstow 15) Joseph hasn\u2019t got the memo. He drops short, twice, and Stokes shovels for two, also twice.    Updated at 5.23pm GMT    5.05pm    29th over: England 77-4 (Stokes 15, Bairstow 15) Just a single, nudged to leg by Stokes, as Seales puts the plug in.  Updated at 5.07pm GMT    4.59pm    28th over: England 76-4 (Stokes 14, Bairstow 15) Stokes hooks Joseph, making a good sound but only getting a single as there\u2019s a man out at deep square. Joseph beats Bairstow outside off, possibly with a bit of help from the wind. \u201cThe breeze was pretty strong at the start,\u201d Mark Butcher reports, \u201cbut it\u2019s really whistling across the ground now.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m a little worried,\u201d says Phil Russell, \u201cthat if England keep on having these batting collapses, they are going to run out of bowlers to drop.\u201d  Updated at 5.07pm GMT    4.55pm    27th over: England 75-4 (Stokes 13, Bairstow 15) Stokes is getting giddy now, on-driving Seales for three. Bairstow punches into the covers for a couple to join him in double figures. And then gets away with a top edge! The ball stuck in the pitch and ended up looping over the keeper for four more. That\u2019s 18 in this session so far at a run a ball: we need to know what these two had for lunch.     4.50pm    26th over: England 66-4 (Stokes 10, Bairstow 9) And four from Stokes too! Going back to force Joseph away past point. He adds a straight push for a single that takes him to double figures after 49 balls. I wonder if Brathwaite has made his first mistake of the day, dishing up inexperience at both ends, rather than bringing Holder back.  Updated at 4.51pm GMT    4.46pm   A four!  25th over: England 61-4 (Stokes 5, Bairstow 9) Jayden Seales returns, bearing a friendly bouncer, which Bairstow pulls for four well in front of square. That\u2019s the first boundary since Dan Lawrence\u2019s last one, 12 long overs ago. The PA marks the moment with a burst of Hey Ya.     4.42pm    \u201cJust recovering from The Merchant of Venice at The Globe,\u201d says Gary Naylor, \u201creflecting on parallels between Shakey\u2019s play and Test cricket. Both have a terrible beauty, ruthlessly expose human fallibility and deliver brutal outcomes. And, try as you might, you just can\u2019t look away.\u201d Ha. (But surely there\u2019s only one Shaky.)     4.40pm    \u201cWell, this is fun,\u201d says Geoff Wignall. \u201cI imagine much England self-congratulation over having had the wisdom to shorten the tail by the removal of Branderson.\u201d Ha. Their batting was the one good reason to get rid of them.     4.03pm   Lunch: England 57-4  24th over: England 57-4 (Stokes 5, Bairstow 5) After that spasm of excitement, Bairstow just wants to make it through to lunch. And he succeeds by playing out five dots from Joseph and then clipping the last ball for another single. The morning belongs firmly to West Indies and above all Kemar Roach, but England, thanks to some self-denial from Stokes and Bairstow, still have a chance of recovering from their traditional collapse.  \u201cReassuring,\u201d says Colum Fordham, \u201dto see that despite the wholesale changes to the team England have maintained their unrivalled penchant for calypso collapso against good fast bowling. Plus \u00e7a change, plus c\u2019est la m\u00eame chose. With a swinging Dukes ball doing plenty in the capable hands of Roach, Holder et al, I\u2019m sure Broad and Anderson will appreciate the wisdom of leaving them at home. The tricky job of saving England\u2019s bacon is going to fall on the shoulders of Stokes, Foakes and all those blokes. So much for the reset. To pick up on Kaan\u2019s remark earlier, it was a grade A hoax.\u201d   Updated at 4.55pm GMT    3.57pm    23rd over: England 56-4 (Stokes 5, Bairstow 4) Roach drops short for once and Bairstow cuts, still carefully, for two. He adds a tuck for a single, so this partnership, which was three off six overs, has now raced to eight off seven.     3.53pm    22nd over: England 53-4 (Stokes 5, Bairstow 1) Holder comes off, so he can relish his immaculate figures (5-5-0-1) over lunch. Joseph returns and Stokes, venturing down the track, clips him for two \u2013 though he also risks a leave that is about three inches from doing to him what it did to Root. \u201cThis England Test side\u2019s reboot is going quite well,\u201d says Abhijato Sensarma. \u201cWhat with, you know, them embracing the Hollywood-esque practice of rehashing the same plotlines, just with different actors...\u201d     3.48pm    21st over: England 51-4 (Stokes 3, Bairstow 1) With a quarter of an hour to go till lunch, Kraigg Brathwaite strokes his chin and wonders how he can make the morning even more of a misery for England. Ah yes, a little burst of Roach, who has the most Test wickets of anyone on this ground (41, apparently). He\u2019s on the spot but Bairstow keeps him out. Bairstow and Stokes seem to be following Michael Vaughan\u2019s advice from before the match: give the first hour to the bowler.  Updated at 3.50pm GMT    3.44pm    20th over: England 51-4 (Stokes 3, Bairstow 1) The bowler is Holder. In the immortal words of Bryan Ferry, you can guess the rest.     3.41pm    19th over: England 51-4 (Stokes 3, Bairstow 1) Stokes plays tip-and-run, going up on his toes and dropping a lifter from Joseph into the crease. Mark Butcher is at the mic \u2013 still the OBO\u2019s favourite commentator \u2013 and he notes that there is more swing in the Caribbean now than there was when he was playing for England (in the only series they\u2019ve won there in half a century, in 2003-04). Today the swing is more pronounced as there\u2019s a strong crosswind, which helped Holder get the movement that did for Lawrence.  Updated at 3.42pm GMT    3.35pm    18th over: England 50-4 (Stokes 2, Bairstow 1) Another over from Holder, another maiden. \u201cHey Tim,\u201d says Edward Wilson, \u201ctwo Aussie guys from Mannheim, Germany here.\u201d Love it. \u201cUtterly surprised we can watch this live on TV. Dunno if it\u2019s sunspots or we\u2019re tapping a satellite. Beautiful warm and sunny day and I could go a G&amp;T but partner has to sing in Britten\u2018s Turn of the Screw at Heidelberg Opera tonight so it\u2019s delayed until tomorrow.\u201d Love it even more. \u201cGower\u2019s commentary okay but much prefer The Guardian OBO. Keep at it! Cheers, Edward Wilson &amp; Christopher Diffey.\u201d     3.32pm    17th over: England 50-4 (Stokes 2, Bairstow 1) Stokes, facing Joseph, manages to take his second single from his 28th ball; Bairstow takes his first from his fourth. England will be fine as long as these two put on 150.      3.28pm    16th over: England 48-4 (Stokes 1, Bairstow 0) There\u2019s a hold-up, not sure why, before Jonny Bairstow can face the last two balls of Holder\u2019s over. He blocks one and leaves the other. Holder\u2019s figures are ridiculous: 3-3-0-1. Who does he think he is, Jimmy Anderson?  \u201cI don\u2019t think it should surprise anyone,\u201d says Mike Wakeman, \u201cthat a callow and inexperienced England batting line-up is struggling away from home against a strong bowling attack with minimal preparation. Test cricket is supposed to be really hard!\u201d Yes, but it doesn\u2019t help if you shove all your rookies into the top four.     3.22pm   Wicket! Lawrence c Blackwood b Holder 20 (England 48-4)  Another one! Holder sets his trap, bowling full and swinging it away. Lawrence falls into it, edging with hard hands, and Jermaine Blackwood finally holds onto a catch \u2013 third slip, third time lucky.   Updated at 3.24pm GMT    3.18pm    15th over: England 48-3 (Lawrence 20, Stokes 1) Joseph tries a bit of rib music. Lawrence hears it coming and tucks behind square for a single.     3.13pm    14th over: England 47-3 (Lawrence 19, Stokes 1) Holder keeps Stokes quiet and beats him outside off \u2013 twice. After two overs, Holder has yet to concede a run. When Root said it would be a tricky first session, he wasn\u2019t wrong.     3.09pm    13th over: England 47-3 (Lawrence 19, Stokes 1) It\u2019s a double change as the man of the morning, Roach, takes a breather with figures of 6-1-28-2. Alzarri Joseph comes on and has Lawrence edging again first ball, but safely through the cordon for four. A worse delivery brings a better shot, a clip for three, and then Stokes gets off the mark by nudging his 14th ball off his hip.   Updated at 3.11pm GMT    3.02pm    12th over: England 39-3 (Lawrence 12, Stokes 0) Now we do have a change as Seales (5-3-11-1) gives way to Jason Holder. His Test bowling average in the Caribbean is 21 \u2013 almost as good as the man commentating, Curtly Ambrose. Holder is just as tall as Sir Curtly, if not as fast or fearsome. He dishes up four balls of line\u2019n\u2019length, one half-volley which Stokes can only smack to short extra, and a jaffa that beats him outside off. And that\u2019s drinks, with a brave new England in a right old mess.  Updated at 3.07pm GMT    2.57pm    11th over: England 39-3 (Lawrence 12, Stokes 0) Brathwaite keeps Roach on, understandably, and perhaps regrets it as the first ball of this over is a dud on leg stump, flicked away for four by Lawrence. But Roach retorts with a much better ball, seaming away, taking the edge \u2013 and Lawrence is dropped. The culprit, as with Root, is Jermaine Blackwood at third slip. \u201cAnother fail by England\u2019s opening batters,\u201d says Steffi Steffenson. \u201cSack the bowlers.\u201d     2.52pm    10th over: England 30-3 (Lawrence 4, Stokes 0) Lawrence, facing Seales, gets a ball on his legs at last and works it away for three. Bowling to Stokes for the first time, Seales produces a perfect inswinger to the left-hander, followed by a nasty bouncer. Stokes meets these different challenges with a rock-solid block and a last-ditch sway.  \u201cIs it too late,\u201d asks Ed Rostron, \u201cto just call this whole thing off and fly them all home?\u201d  Updated at 2.55pm GMT    2.47pm    9th over: England 27-3 (Lawrence 1, Stokes 0) To be fair to Root, it was a superb bit of bowling from Kemar Roach \u2013 not just the skill to bring the ball back sharply into the off bail, but the character to bounce straight back from having a catch dropped.   Updated at 2.49pm GMT    2.44pm   Wicket!! Root b Roach 13 (England 27-3)  Bowled playing no stroke! After being dropped off the previous ball, slashing to third slip. Root goes off shaking his head. The red-ball reset is beginning with a calypso collapse.   Updated at 2.48pm GMT    2.41pm    8th over: England 23-2 (Root 9, Lawrence 1) Another maiden from Seales, who beats Lawrence with the last ball even though it appears to move back in. The amount of movement should bring some cheer to Chris Woakes, who badly needs some wickets.     2.39pm    7th over: England 23-2 (Root 9, Lawrence 1) In an astonishing development, England take a single \u2013 in fact two. Root dabs Roach into the on side, whereupon Lawrence takes the hint and gets off the mark with a back-foot push into the covers.. One of the many things this team have to work on is their running between the wickets: only Jonny Bairstow is really good at it, and in Tests he comes in too late to set the tone. To celebrate these modest steps forward, Root clips Roach to the midwicket boundary.     2.33pm    6th over: England 17-2 (Root 4, Lawrence 0) Another maiden as Seales finds some more of that shape outside off. Dan Lawrence looks busy but can\u2019t get off the mark. To go with the gloating Aussie, we now have a fuming Pom. \u201cWhat will it take for England just to pick their best XI?\u201d demands Ian Batch. \u201cThe always arrogant England have once again not picked their strongest team for a Test match. So, I hope they lose.  \u201cRoot should\u2019ve been sacked, and dropping Broad and Anderson for the sake of it was ridiculous, especially when Robinson is not yet fit enough, not just for this match, for Test cricket generally. Why no Parkinson instead of Leach? How can Woakes take the new ball away from home? I could go on and on but why bother, I\u2019ll just cheer on the West Indies.\u201d     2.29pm    5th over: England 17-2 (Root 4, Lawrence 0) Root plays out a maiden from Roach, who is enjoying keeping up the pressure. On a day of firsts, we have the first gloating Aussie of the series. \u201cThe match didn\u2019t start until 1am here in Melbourne,\u201d says Tony Hastings, \u201cbut I figured I could fit in a few English wickets before heading off to bed. Disappointed that Root only has to come in at bugger all for 1 instead of bugger all for 2 now though.\u201d  Updated at 2.31pm GMT    2.25pm    4th over: England 17-2 (Root 4, Lawrence 0) So this new England find themselves in a rather familiar predicament. Jayden Seales earned that by getting his length spot-on in this over after overpitching at first. \u201cA fantastic over,\u201d says Steve Harmison, who knows a bit about bowling in the Caribbean.  Updated at 2.27pm GMT    2.22pm   Wicket! Crawley c da Silva b Seales 8 (England 17-2)  Another one! And it\u2019s a great catch, as Joshua da Silva has to change direction sharply and take it low to his left. Not a great shot by Zak Crawley, who drove loosely and got an inside edge through a wide-open gate.   Updated at 2.31pm GMT    2.20pm    3rd over: England 17-1 (Crawley 8, Root 4) So Joe Root is in rather early \u2013 well, he\u2019s used to that. He gets off the mark with a very Root stroke, the square force that is all touch and no force at all. Bar one no-ball, England are getting \u2019em in boundaries. \u201cKudos to Kaan for his minstrelsy,\u201d says Gabriel Munns. picking up on Rob Lewis\u2019s email at 13:49. \u201cI\u2019d just add that if those three blokes are seen buying Cokes from some other folks, we could turn the whole Test match into a Dr. Seuss book.\u201d      2.15pm   Wicket! Lees LBW b Roach 4 (England 12-1)  No edge, though the ball was close to the bat. That left Lees hoping he\u2019d been struck outside the line, but it was umpire\u2019s call. His first Test innings was good while it lasted, but it only lasted nine balls. It was typically shrewd bowling by Roach, finding just enough movement back in after three outswingers.    Updated at 2.30pm GMT    2.11pm   Wicket!? Lees given LBW b Roach 4 (England 12-1)  This looks out, is given out, but Lees reviews, perhaps hoping for the thinnest of inside edges...     2.10pm    2nd over: England 12-0 (Lees 4, Crawley 8) The new ball is shared by Jayden Seales, a young man in such a hurry that he has played more Tests (five now) than other first-class games (three). And taken more Test wickets (16) than other first-class ones (seven). He\u2019s pacey but the pitch is not. Zak Crawley, standing outside his crease, plays a straight drive and a cover drive, both for four, both handsome. Seales finishes with a better ball, shaping away from a good length, but Crawley picks the swing and leaves it.     2.04pm    1st over: England 4-0 (Lees 4, Crawley 0) Kemar Roach takes the new ball, from round the wicket, and Alex Lees faces his first ball in Tests. It\u2019s the best thing he could wish for short of a freebie on his legs: an easy leave outside off, swinging away but going through very slowly. He plays the second ball, a solid block. And he gets off the mark to the fourth, seeing some width and square-driving for four past gully. A comfortable start.     2.00pm    Both sides take the knee. This is greeted, thank goodness, by a respectful round of applause.     1.58pm    The players link arms for the anthems. They\u2019re all in black armbands in memory of the two late greats, Rod Marsh and Shane Warne. It\u2019s good to see, but an even better tribute to Warne would have been to pick a leg-spinner on this bare surface. He advised England to pick Matt Parkinson in Brisbane, and was rather proved right by what happened to Jack Leach there.      1.55pm    \u201cNow that, Tim ...\u201d says David Horn, \u201c*that* was a top-notch preamble.\u201d Too kind! \u201cCan\u2019t wait for the series to start. I\u2019m picturing Jimmy and Stuart-y sitting back in their chairs, arms folded, and saying \u2018Right. Get out of this if you can.\u2019\u201d Ha. I\u2019d pay good money to get access to their WhatsApps.     1.53pm    \u201cDon\u2019t disparage Alex Lees as a blocker,\u201d says Mark Douglas on Twitter. \u201cHe was brilliant alongside Graham Clark in the Royal London cup last season so he can bat a bit. Saying that, if he blocks his way to a big score I will be made up.\u201d I didn\u2019t mean it as an insult at all, just an observation based on his Boycottian 65 in England\u2019s warm-up game.      1.49pm    Here\u2019s Rob Lewis with a line from his son Kaan, who is 12. \u201cStokes, Foakes and Woakes?\u201d says Kaan. \u201cIt must be a hoax.\u201d     1.47pm    \u201cI\u2019m in the unusual situation,\u201d says Lewis Clarke, \u201cof following this Test on OBO whilst my Dad (on holiday... alright for some :-)) is able to attend his (first?!) Test match in person. Anyway, hello Dad, and here\u2019s to a cracking game.\u201d Hear, hear and hello, Lewis\u2019s Dad.     1.45pm    The match is on BT Sport in the UK and their latest recruit is Sam Billings. He may be setting a new world record for the time taken to go from Test cricketer to Test pundit: one match. \u201cTest cricket,\u201d he tells us, \u201cis all about character. It\u2019s more important than technique.\u201d      1.41pm   Teams: West Indies  A minor surprise from Kraigg Brathwaite as he leaves out Kyle Mayers. He will have five proper bowlers at his disposal, whereas Joe Root will have four plus two halves in himself and Ben Stokes. West Indies 1 Kraigg Brathwaite (capt), 2 John Campbell, 3 Shamarh Brooks, 4 Nkrumah Bonner, 5 Jermaine Blackwood, 6 Jason Holder, 7 Joshua da Silva (wkt), 8 Alzarri Joseph, 9 Kemar Roach, 10 Veerasammy Permaul, 11 Jayden Seales.  Updated at 1.42pm GMT    1.36pm   Teams: a new England  Six changes from their last Test at Hobart.  England 1 Zak Crawley, 2 Alex Lees, 3 Joe Root (capt), 4 Dan Lawrence, 5 Ben Stokes, 6 Jonny Bairstow, 7 Ben Foakes (wkt), 8 Chris Woakes, 9 Craig Overton, 10 Mark Wood, 11 Jack Leach.     1.34pm   Toss: England win and bat  Joe Root calls right and opts to bat first, although \u201cit\u2019s going to be challenging for the first session.\u201d     1.33pm    The first email of the series comes from Andrew Benton. \u201cIt was a bit surprising that Root kept the captaincy,\u201d he reckons. \u201cThere is the impression that he\u2019s a bit smug about that, and the Ashes failure was all other people\u2019s fault... Hopefully his days are numbered anyway and he\u2019ll be replaced later this year. If this series is lost with anything less than a truly competitive, gripping performance from England, then that should happen very soon.\u201d     1.32pm    Alex Lees has been presented with his cap by Jonny Bairstow. (No such moment for Saqib Mahmood, so he must be the 12th man.) Lees is the 700th man to play Test cricket for England, and the umpteenth to be invited to open the batting since the days of Strauss and Cook.      1.01pm   Preamble: the morning after  Hello everyone and welcome to the first Test. It\u2019s not just the first Test of a new series, which is always mouth-watering: it\u2019s the first test of a new England. This is the morning after the night of the long knives.  Gone are the head coach, the head coach\u2019s boss, the batting coach, the opening pair that played most of the Ashes series, the No 3 who was there throughout, the No 6 who was supposed to be a rising star, the regular wicketkeeper and sometime vice-captain \u2013 oh, and the two most prolific seamers in England\u2019s history. And yet they still have the same captain, fresh from ten defeats in the past 15 Tests. So the question is: was it the night of the wrong knives?  Today we begin to find out the answer. Joe Root and Ben Stokes, the sole survivors from the top seven that started the Ashes, are joined by Zak Crawley, a dasher just emerging from a dreadful year; Alex Lees, a blocker making his Test debut; Dan Lawrence, a talented understudy now thrust into centre stage at No 4; and Jonny Bairstow, the bit-part player who ended up as England\u2019s best batter in Australia.  The gloves go back to Ben Foakes, who becomes England\u2019s fifth Test keeper in the past ten months: after Bracey, Buttler, Bairstow and Billings, it feels like Buggins\u2019 turn. But Foakes is a class act, silkier than the rest. The new ball, owned by Anderson and Broad for the past 14 years, will be handed to Chris Woakes and, for the first time, Craig Overton. Both are skilful bowlers and useful batters, but in Australia one of them was at his worst and the other couldn\u2019t get a game even when England were falling apart. Will they feel the faith Root is suddenly placing in them, or the pressure he is putting them under?  First change will be Mark Wood, who is super-fast and a top-class tourist but recuperating from illness and prone to injury. The fourth specialist bowler is likely to be the lone spinner in the XII, Jack Leach, who tends to struggle in the first innings of a Test. The senior bowler is now Stokes, who is still getting over a side strain. It all adds up to a set of gambles that could easily turn into a shambles. West Indies\u2019 line-up is even less seasoned yet slightly more settled. There are only four men in this match with a Test bowling average under 30, and every one of them is a West Indian. Kemar Roach is a proper leader of the pack, Jayden Seales an exciting beginner, Jason Holder a superb third seamer, Alzarri Joseph a rapid back-up, Kyle Mayers a handy medium-pacer. The batting feels more fallible, although the captain, Kraigg Brathwaite, arrives on a high after making a career-best 276 for Barbados against Jamaica, and England saw in the T20 series that when Mayers hits the ball, it stays hit.  On paper this looks like a low-scoring dogfight. But the Viv Richards Stadium is the most draw-friendly ground in the Caribbean with only five results in its ten Tests to date. The pitch is apparently shorn, so it could be flat and slow \u2013 though there are showers about that should freshen it up for the fast bowlers. Play starts at 10am in Antigua, 2pm GMT, and I\u2019ll be back about 25 minutes before that with the toss and the teams.  "

                    "body": "If England are to return from Australia victorious this summer then it is almost an understatement to say the fledgling partnership between Marcus Smith and Owen Farrell needs to develop into a formidable double act. It is a truism that England will rely on their forward muscle, their kicking prowess and their set-piece grunt against the wily Wallabies but despite the importance of those parts of the game, so much rides on whether Smith and Farrell hit it off on the pitch. They have managed only 68 minutes at 10-12 for England so far together, as it turns out, against Australia in the autumn - a comprehensive victory for Eddie Jones\u2019s side and a qualified success for the Smith-Farrell axis. The idea is that Farrell can step in at first receiver during structured play while Smith lurks, scanning for space and waiting for the opportunity with that little bit more time. Sounds simple enough on paper but lest we forget they did not have Samu Kerevi lining them up back in November and it is a surefire bet they will see plenty of the Australia centre in the coming weeks.  Without Manu Tuilagi at outside centre, the importance of the two men inside whoever wears the No 13 jersey is heightened and though Jones will keep his cards close to his chest over selection - to the extent he has not publicly named his tour captain - he has been candid over his plans for Smith and Farrell, who have been wasting little opportunity to get themselves on the same page. \u201cHe\u2019s a brilliant player,\u201d said Smith of Farrell. \u201cHe\u2019s a massive competitor and wears his heart on his sleeve. More than that he\u2019s got brilliant vision and skills at the line. Hopefully we can put our competitive edge together to try and get a Test series win. We\u2019ve spoken long and hard about it. I think we complement each other nicely. I think we both see the game pretty similarly. I hope we can both come together and get the best out of each other. Hopefully I can be there to get the best out of him and allow him to show his skills on the park. Hopefully he can also allow me to show the best of me.\u201d  Outwardly, they are markedly different personalities but Smith and Farrell share an obsession with all things rugby which ensures they have plenty to talk about and when the England squad descends en masse to the second game of rugby league\u2019s State of Origin series on Sunday in the same stadium that stages next Saturday\u2019s first Test, there will be few spectators watching the match more intently. \u201cI love watching Super Rugby and the NRL,\u201d adds Smith. \u201cI actually can\u2019t get enough. It\u2019s brilliant to bounce ideas off him and George [Ford] when he\u2019s in camp as well. It\u2019s nice to learn from these guys because they\u2019ve got so much experience. Hopefully we can continue to do that with the Origin games which are going on at the same time. We chat here and there and if we see something in any game, we talk and chew the fat a little bit. We\u2019ll try and bring it together if we get to play together. Through the season we definitely share ideas. We try to talk when we can.\u201d Smith has proved an avid learner. He works closely with Jonny Wilkinson whenever the World Cup winner drops into England camps, he remains in close contact with Finn Russell following the British &amp; Irish Lions tour last summer, he took himself off to train with Leeds Rhinos and he has been picking the brains of Quade Cooper, the Australia fly-half who he may well line up against in Perth next weekend.  \u201cWe\u2019ve connected a little bit over socials and he\u2019s helped me a lot actually,\u201d says Smith. \u201cHe\u2019s taught me a few things he\u2019s done. This time I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll be talking too much on the tour but hopefully post-game we can have a beer and hopefully I\u2019ll be the one smiling. \u201cJust different ways to see the game. The types of things he looks for when he\u2019s analysing opposition. The way he thinks when he makes a mistake. It\u2019s his mindset, really. It\u2019s pretty amazing to chat to those guys and just pick up one thing from them because they\u2019ve been playing international rugby for a long time now.\u201d This will be Smith\u2019s first tour with England. He needs no history lesson over the significance of Anglo-Australian rivalries, however. \u201c[It] is obviously huge, not just in rugby but in cricket and all other sports. My dad instilled in me as a young kid that there is a lot of rivalry and confrontation in those games. It\u2019s one of those rivalries you want to be a part of.\u201d"

                    "body": "US and UK financial institutions have been among the leading investors in Russian \u201ccarbon bomb\u201d fossil fuel projects, according to a new database of holdings from recent years. Campaigners in Ukraine said these institutions must immediately end such investments, to limit the funding of Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine and to avoid climate breakdown. Carbon bombs are fossil-fuel extraction projects identified by researchers to contain at least 1bn tonnes of climate-heating CO<sub>2</sub>, triple the UK\u2019s annual emissions. Russia is a hotspot, with 40 carbon bombs, 19 of them operated or developed by Russian companies backed by foreign finance. The companies are Gazprom, Novatek, Lukoil, Rosneft oil company and Tatneft. The database, produced by the Leave it in the Ground Initiative (Lingo), found more than 400 foreign financial institutions had provided $130bn (\u00a3109bn) of support to the Russian companies \u2013 $52bn in investment and $84bn in credit. The data was released on Wednesday, Ukraine\u2019s independence day and six months since the start of the Russian invasion.  Financial institutions in the US hold almost half the foreign investment in Russian carbon bomb companies, with 154 institutions holding $23.6bn. The largest combination of investment and credit \u2013 $10bn \u2013 was provided by JPMorgan Chase, which other analyses have also identified as a leading funder of fossil fuels. The biggest single investment in the Russian carbon bomb companies was the $15.3bn in Rosneft held by the Qatar Investment Authority, Qatar\u2019s sovereign wealth fund. The UK was third in the list of investing nations, with 32 financial institutions holding $2.5bn in investments. HSBC had the largest investment and credit total, at $308m. Financial groups in Japan, Norway, Switzerland and the Netherlands also held significant investments, while Chinese and Italian institutions provided $45bn in credit between them. \u201cPutin\u2019s war is funded through money from fossil fuels and these fossil fuels are causing climate breakdown as we speak,\u201d said Svitlana Romanko, director of the Ukrainian NGO Razom We Stand, which is calling for an immediate end to all foreign investment in Russian fossil fuel companies and a permanent embargo on Russian oil, gas and coal. \u201cInvesting in Russian carbon bombs is the worst thing you can do today.\u201d  Kjell K\u00fchne, at Lingo, said: \u201cThis [war] has made really clear that, when you don\u2019t care who you\u2019re doing business with, it does translate into human suffering and lives lost. It\u2019s also clear we should not be investing in new fossil fuel projects, as the International Energy Agency has confirmed. Anybody involved in these projects should be really questioning what they\u2019re doing.\u201d The Lingo researchers said some financial institutions may have reduced their support for the Russian companies since the war started, but that many seemed to have adopted a wait-and-see approach. The researchers hope the database will enable campaigners to challenge the 400 institutions over their investments. The foreign financial support is largely for big oil and gas projects in Russia, including in Siberia and the Arctic. Coal projects are mainly supported by domestic investors, the researchers said. The database only includes financial support for the Russian fossil fuel companies and not for foreign oil and gas companies that work in Russia, or the services companies that support them. In May, the Guardian revealed that world\u2019s biggest fossil fuel firms were quietly planning huge oil and gas projects that would drive the climate past internationally agreed temperature limits, with catastrophic global impacts. The plans included 195 carbon bombs identified by K\u00fchne and his colleagues, 60% of which have already started pumping. \u201cWe have identified the carbon bombs, now we have to defuse them,\u201d he said. A spokeswoman for HSBC said: \u201cHSBC Asset Management has suspended dealings in its Russia-only funds which include the Russian oil and gas companies referenced and [is] no longer investing further in funds whose objectives included investing in Russian securities. In these funds, exposure to Russian equities has generally been reduced or exited.\u201d JPMorgan Chase and the Qatar Investment Authority have also been contacted for comment."

                    "body": "The England captain, Leah Williamson, has described Northern Ireland as a \u201cserious contender\u201d ahead of the Lionesses\u2019 World Cup qualifier at Windsor Park on Tuesday evening.\nWilliamson is the only confirmed change to England\u2019s starting lineup having sat out the 10-0 win against North Macedonia in Skopje on Friday as a result of precautionary concussion protocol.\n\n\u201cI thought the girls were great, very professional, we had a job to do, we wanted to create lots of chances and prove to be a clinical team and the girls did that,\u201d Williamson said. \u201cIt\u2019s never nice to sit out a football match but when the girls play like that it\u2019s fairly easy.\u201d\nShould England beat Northern Ireland and Austria drop points against Latvia, also on Tuesday evening, then the Lionesses\u2019 qualification for the 2023 World Cup would be confirmed with two games to spare. For Northern Ireland, who meet England in Group A at the European Championship this summer, a win would keep alive their hopes of a playoff spot \u2013 they sit third in the group, three points behind Austria.\nIn October, in front of 23,225 fans at Wembley, England beat Northern Ireland 4-0 with a second-half hat\u2011trick from the Arsenal forward Beth Mead and a 72nd-minute strike from Chelsea\u2019s Beth England. On paper, beating a side 38 places below them in the world rankings should be a straightforward task for England but Northern Ireland, managed by Kenny Shiels, are a rapidly evolving team and Williamson is refusing to take them lightly.\n\u201cIt was a competitive and difficult game last time, especially in the first half,\u201d she said. \u201cYes, we\u2019ve had some games we\u2019ve won comfortably [in this qualifying campaign] but I don\u2019t expect it to be comfortable on Tuesday \u2013 Northern Ireland are proving with each game that comes that they\u2019re a serious contender.\n\u201cThat\u2019s the beauty of qualification. There\u2019s something to play for and you don\u2019t get much more of a challenge than that.\u201d\n\nFor the Arsenal defender, the occasion will be extra special as it will be the first time she leads England out since the manager, Sarina Wiegman, named her as her captain for the home European Championship this summer.\n\u201cThe main thing is it\u2019s obviously a very proud moment,\u201d Williamson said. \u201cThe biggest honour in football. I appreciate that and I\u2019m aware of the responsibility that comes with that title, especially in England.\n\u201cMy family are obviously very happy for me. For us it\u2019s something we do every day, it\u2019s our job but for them it\u2019s something for them to enjoy and maybe after all these years of following me around and watching me, to watch me then do it on the biggest stage, with that responsibility, is really proud for them.\u201d\nWilliamson is also no stranger to feeling the heat in Belfast. On 9 April 2015, two weeks after her 18th birthday, the then under-19s captain was forced to take a truly bizarre penalty in the city against Norway.\nIt was a replay of a penalty she had taken against the same opponent in a European Championship qualifier five days earlier and which she converted, only for it to be ruled out by the referee Marija Kurtes for encroachment.\nThe German official subsequently awarded Norway a free-kick when she should have ordered the penalty to be retaken \u2013 Uefa intervened and decided it would indeed be retaken, in isolation, in Belfast. Williamson again converted, securing a 2-2 draw for England and sealing their place at the European Championship finals.\n\n\u201cIt turned out well in the end but what I went through that week I wouldn\u2019t wish on anybody,\u201d Williamson said. \u201cI remember I told my mum I would keep it quiet in case I missed and nobody would ever know, and then you lot turned up with your Sky Sports cameras. There\u2019s a couple of the girls here that were in that squad and we were reminiscing about it the other day. It\u2019s a good memory because it turned out well, but it could have gone very differently.\u201d\nLooking ahead to the World Cup qualifier against Northern Ireland, as well as beyond, Wiegman said: \u201cAs we approach every game we are looking to develop our style of play, we want to play well, we want to play good as a team and tomorrow we want to create lots of chances and concede no goals.\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be a tough game, it\u2019s going to be a great crowd, a big occasion, so I\u2019m really looking forward to that, For them, it\u2019s possibly the last chance they have to win to be able to qualify and we want to win and get as close as possible to qualifying.\u201d"

                    "body": "Fikayo Tomori is not normally one for a post-match snack, but on the way back from Milan\u2019s win at Napoli this month he made an exception. \u201cOne of the players came up to me and said: \u2018You should try this, it\u2019s from Naples,\u2019\u201d he recalls of having a tray with two sfogliatelle \u2013 traditional crispy pastries with a sweet filling \u2013 thrust under his nose. \u201cAfter games I can\u2019t normally eat because my body\u2019s all over the place, but I tried it. Then it was like: \u2018Ahhhh, that\u2019s kinda nice!\u2019\u201d  He chuckles at the memory of a moment that has gone viral, Tomori\u2019s suspicious first bite, furrowed brow and then furiously enthusiastic nodding further securing his place in the affections of supporters he had already won over with performances on the pitch. In 14 months, the Englishman has gone from a speculative mid-season loan signing to one of the first names on the teamsheet for a side top of Serie A. Seamless integration on the pitch has been mirrored in his approach to life off it. Fans were surprised, after that win over Napoli, to see Tomori deliver an interview in near fluent Italian. \u201cI always saw myself one day living in another country,\u201d says Tomori, \u201cwhether that was for football or just in life. I always wanted to learn a new language. At home, my parents were from Nigeria, so they spoke Yoruba to me, and obviously at school you learn languages, but I came to Italy determined to learn Italian. Even if I was only going to be here on loan six months, I wanted to at least be able to know the present tense.\u201d It may have been that mindset that ensured his stay would last longer, Milan making his transfer permanent for close to \u20ac28.5m. Tomori arrived last January with his career at a crossroads, a 23-year-old graduate of the Chelsea academy who had started 15 Premier League games for the Blues during the 2019-20 season but none in the first half of the following campaign. Milan needed cover at centre-back, with Simon Kj\u00e6r struggling through a series of injuries and their captain, Alessio Romagnoli, out of form. As the manager, Stefano Pioli, told the Observer in January, he had been impressed by aspects of the player\u2019s game on video but found Tomori\u2019s attitude and approach to be \u201ca positive surprise in every way\u201d.  The admiration is mutual, Tomori appreciating the way Pioli will come to him even after a good match and talk through specific situations where he could have adjusted his positioning. Such intense focus on details represents a key point of difference for the player between Serie A and the Premier League. \u201cIn England, it\u2019s more like basketball,\u201d says Tomori. \u201cEverything\u2019s end-to-end, there\u2019s more intensity, a lot more happens reactively. In Italy it\u2019s more like American football. It\u2019s like you have \u2018plays\u2019. When the ball\u2019s here, I need to be here. When the ball goes, I know I have to be two metres over in that direction, or be looking for this particular player \u2026 \u201cIn England it\u2019s very much off the cuff and things happen so fast. You can be attacking one minute and the next the ball\u2019s flipped over your head and you\u2019ve got to run back 30 yards, then you\u2019re back on the attack. Here it\u2019s more like: \u2018OK, the ball\u2019s there, where\u2019s my teammate? Where\u2019s the opposition?\u2019 If the ball goes over the top I need to be in a position where I can leave the striker and get there, but if the ball goes into feet I\u2019m in a position to go press.\u201d It is not just Pioli helping him to work out these finer points. Tomori\u2019s decision to join Milan was sealed by a call from Paolo Maldini, \u201cthe best defender ever\u201d, now the Milan technical director. Although not involved with day-to-day coaching, he is happy to share advice. \u201cThe other day he was talking to us about the speed of the ball moving through the back and how to work on our body position,\u201d says Tomori. \u201cAs defenders, you want to make sure you\u2019re impressing him.\u201d  Tomori believes he has improved at Milan, especially in his concentration and tactical awareness. Yet after being called up by England for the first time in two years last September he was omitted for World Cup qualifiers in November and again for this month\u2019s friendlies. Instead, he travelled to Dubai this week to meet supporters and help run a kids\u2019 training session at the local AC Milan Academy, as part of the club\u2019s delegation to Expo 2020. To miss out is a disappointment for a player who aspires to be part of England\u2019s squad for Qatar 2022, but Tomori does not believe playing in Italy has put him at a disadvantage. \u201cThere\u2019s just so many talented players in my position already \u2013 [Harry] Maguire, [John] Stones, [Conor] Coady, [Tyrone] Mings, [Ben] White at Arsenal \u2013 and there\u2019s a limited amount of positions. \u201cI just have to make sure I\u2019m playing at a high level. And then when I do get called on, to make sure I\u2019m ready. I have to focus on what I\u2019m doing here at Milan first and foremost.\u201d In the meantime, he can take satisfaction from having helped, in a roundabout way, Tammy Abraham to get his international career back on track. His former Chelsea teammate sought his advice when the option of a Serie A move arose last summer. \u201cWhen he said Roma was on the table, I said: \u2018Bro this is a good league\u2019,\u201d recalls Tomori. \u201cI felt like it would develop his game a lot. He has scored a lot of goals this season for Roma, they\u2019re fighting for a Champions League spot. Definitely it\u2019s helped him and definitely I gave him rave reviews about Serie A because I enjoyed myself so much the first six months.\u201d He is still relishing it. Tomori has noticed himself adjusting the way he lives in countless little ways \u2013 from the must-have macchiato after every meal, where previously he never drank coffee, to a new preference for relaxing outside with friends and fresh air on the terrace after training instead of heading home. \u201cI was speaking to my sister yesterday, and that\u2019s family, she\u2019s known me her whole life. And she said: \u2018You just seem a lot calmer, a lot smilier.\u2019 I think that\u2019s probably the way Italy is. Everything is a bit more chilled. In England, everything is so rushed and hustle and bustle. In Italy, everyone\u2019s walking a bit slower. Everything\u2019s just a bit calmer.\u201d Not everything is perfect. Our conversation takes place shortly before Milan\u2019s 1-0 win at Cagliari, where monkey chants were aimed at Tomori and his teammate Mike Maignan during the post-game celebrations. Previously, Tomori said he had not experienced any racist abuse in Italy, although he was aware of cases at Serie A games. He later shares his experience of the events in Sardinia via a recorded voice note.  \u201cObviously that was not a good moment,\u201d Tomori says. \u201cBut all the players helped me to get away from the situation. Everyone knew what was going on. I spoke to the referee and since then everyone\u2019s been very supportive and tried to give me as much support as possible, which was great. The steps to try and stop this is what we need to do next. It was a sad moment for me and Mike as well but the club were very supportive and they gave a reaction to it very quickly.\u201d  Tomori has spoken before about racist abuse on social media and remains frustrated by companies\u2019 failure to do more to close it down. \u201cYou could make a foul, concede a penalty, anything, and by the time you get back in the changing room, you\u2019ve got a thousand messages from nobody. People who make a fake account, people who know they can say this without having any consequences, feel like they\u2019re untouchable, whatever it may be. Social media companies should be able to do more to curtail what\u2019s happening.\u201d Tomori will continue to speak out against racism \u2013 the incident in Cagliari occurred on the weekend the league launched an anti-racism campaign with a video that he was part of \u2013 but also focus on his own career ambitions. On the day he arrived at Milan, and walked through the club\u2019s museum, Tomori spoke of wanting to live up to the club\u2019s history by winning trophies. In the long run, he hopes that will include European success, something he believes is achievable despite the club\u2019s Champions League group-stage exit this season and the failure of any Italian sides to reach the quarter-finals. \u201cI think there\u2019s cycles in football,\u201d he says. \u201cBefore it was Real Madrid, Barcelona, then it was Bayern Munich, then it was the English teams. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a specific correlation between Italian football and not doing well in the Champions League.  \u201cFor a lot of players in our team this season was their first experience of Champions League football. And we didn\u2019t have an easy group [alongside Liverpool, Atl\u00e9tico Madrid and Porto].\u201d  The immediate objective is to claim this season\u2019s Serie A title. It would be Tomori\u2019s first senior trophy. With eight games remaining, Milan have a three-point lead over second-place Napoli. Tomori is tickled to know that Pioli\u2019s mum still reminds him every season that he is yet to win a trophy in senior management. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say my parents give me a hard time like that,\u201d he says with a chuckle. \u201cBut it\u2019s obviously something they want me to do, they want me to have a successful career. \u201cWe\u2019re in a good position but we\u2019re taking it game by game. Hopefully at the end we have something to celebrate, and the manager\u2019s mum can let him rest.\u201d"

Woakes returned from the West Indies in March with injuries to his shoulder and his knee and has since reported a minor problem with an ankle. He has played one second XI match this summer. He was initially told to take \u201ca bit of a break\u201d, but doctors now suspect there is a problem with the cartilage of his left knee that will require surgery. Recovery if the operation is successful is expected to take between four and six weeks, leaving him with a battle to prove his fitness before the seven T20s England have scheduled in Pakistan in September as part of their World Cup preparations. It is the second time in less than a week that an England seamer has felt forced to undergo surgery to try to win a place on the plane to Australia after Mark Wood \u2013 who had an operation on his right elbow in March \u2013 had a second procedure on the same joint last weekend. Four other England bowlers \u2013 Jofra Archer, Olly Stone, Saqib Mahmood and Matt Fisher \u2013 are recovering from stress fractures to the back, while this week Ollie Robinson is playing his first game in more than two months, for Sussex against Nottinghamshire in the County Championship.  Having rested since his return from the West Indies, Woakes reported in early June that he had \u201cturned a corner\u201d. At the time he said: \u201cI\u2019ve got the ball back in my hand, albeit some very light bowling sessions, but I feel like competitive cricket isn\u2019t too far away.\u201d He played at the end of that month for Warwickshire\u2019s second XI in a four-day game against Worcestershire\u2019s second XI, but after bowling nine overs was withdrawn with discomfort to his knee, did not bat or bowl in the second innings, and has not played a competitive game since."

                    "body": "\u2018Happy Thursday everyone!\u201d the official Uefa Europa League account tweeted on the morning of 24 February, looking ahead to another crucial round of matches in Europe\u2019s second most prestigious men\u2019s football competition. Alas, not everyone was in quite as festive a mood. For, just a few hours earlier, Russian artillery had moved into Ukraine bringing up the curtain on a bloody and avoidable war in mainland Europe. It\u2019s easy to forget it now, amid the breathtaking speed with which the world of sport has closed ranks against Russia, but in the hours and days after the fighting started Uefa on Twitter was hardly the only sports authority to monumentally fail to read the room. For example, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) eventually banned Russia from the Paralympic Winter Games but only after first announcing an unsatisfactory compromise in which Russian athletes would have been allowed to compete in neutral colours. Fifa only kicked the Russians out of this year\u2019s World Cup qualifying after other European teams made it clear they were not prepared to play them. This is, after all, how Big Sport has instinctively operated: cautiously, conservatively, with a moral cowardice that runs as deep as its avarice. With empty gestures and weasel words. Only when the scale of global outrage became apparent, only when it became obvious that any entity associated with Russia was at risk of suffering grievous, perhaps terminal reputational damage, did many governing bodies take decisive action. \u201cThere go my people,\u201d the French revolutionary Alexandre Ledru-Rollin is said to have remarked. \u201cI must find out where they are going so I can lead them.\u201d This is not a particularly new phenomenon. In 1939, the IOC was looking for a new venue for the 1940 Winter Olympics after Japan\u2019s military aggression meant it had to relinquish hosting rights (voluntarily, rather than after any significant pressure). Hitler\u2019s invasion of Poland soon forced the IOC to cancel the Games entirely, having first reassigned them to the charming ski resort of Garmisch-Partenkirchen in Nazi Germany. However, even in this digital age, it is possible to feel vaguely stunned at the speed with which the landscape of sport has now changed. The men\u2019s Champions League final has been stripped from St Petersburg and handed to Paris. Manchester United have ended their commercial partnership with Aeroflot. Russian teams \u2013 and in some cases individual athletes \u2013 have been banned across sport, from athletics to cycling, rugby union to Formula One. It is inconceivable that Russia will be allowed to host any major sporting event for many years.  Most shocking of all, individuals whose wealth and power were widely assumed to be impregnable have been forced from the stage. Roman Abramovich has announced his intention to sell Chelsea FC, sensing the threat of sanctions in the UK. The Russian billionaire Alisher Usmanov has stepped down as president of the International Fencing Federation and his sponsorship of Everton FC has been suspended. Even Vladimir Putin has been punished, with the International Judo Federation stripping him of the honorary presidency he has held since 2008. Other cases are more complex. Was it right for Russian F1 driver Nikita Mazepin to be ejected from the British Grand Prix then see his Haas team contract terminated? Should individual Russian athletes be punished unless they condemn the invasion of Ukraine? Will Ivan Drago have to be censored out of the Rocky movies? In part, this is the tragedy of autocracy: the state and the individual begin to bleed into each other to the extent that it is difficult to separate them. Whether you are a billionaire oligarch, a film-maker reliant on state funding or an athlete benefiting from a centralised performance programme, it is virtually impossible to thrive in Russia without becoming entangled with the regime in some form. But the wider lesson here is one that goes well beyond Russia and well beyond this war. For years, we have been told by the world\u2019s sporting bodies, many of its athletes and the majority of its autocratic regimes that sport can and should be kept separate from politics. Now we realise why they were so intent on touting and maintaining this fiction. For those invested in the smooth running of international sport, either as a vehicle for commercial growth, personal enrichment or soft power, politics means questions and moral dilemmas. It means independent thought, scrutiny and oversight. It means exercising a conscience. It means change. Now, as it turns out, an entire country can be wiped from the sporting map almost overnight if the will is there to do it. And for political reasons, rather than anything it has done on the field of play. This was possible all along! Why, then, was Russia allowed to host the 2018 Fifa World Cup? Why was the genocidal regime in China rewarded with this year\u2019s Winter Olympics? Why have abusive governments in the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia been allowed to own football clubs and cycling teams? Why is this year\u2019s World Cup in Qatar? The past week has been an eye-opener in many ways. Athletes leading the call to action. Public opinion forcing governing bodies into U-turns. People beginning to rethink the entire relationship between elite sport, money and power. Maybe this is just a fleeting illusion of solidarity in the jaws of a terrible human catastrophe. But if things really are going to change, this is how it starts. \u2022 Jonathan Liew is a Guardian sports writer"

                    "body": "The acting head of the UN mission in Afghanistan met Taliban leaders on Monday in a bid to persuade them to withdraw their ban on all women working for aid agencies.\nRamiz Alakbarov met the Taliban\u2019s economy minister, Din Mohammad Hanif, in Kabul, telling him that millions of Afghans need \u201chumanitarian assistance and removing barriers is vital\u201d.\nNida Mohammad Nadim, the Taliban higher education minister, responded to the international criticism, saying his government will not change its mind on girls\u2019 access to education \u201ceven if they drop an atomic bomb on us\u201d adding \u201cwe are ready for sanctions by the international community\u201d.\nMeanwhile, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Qatar announced in a statement that access to work is a principle of human rights that is accepted by all countries of the world. It is the latest government of a Muslim country to criticise the Taliban\u2019s move.\nAt least seven major international aid groups have suspended their vitally needed operations in Afghanistan, potentially leaving the country\u2019s battered economy on the brink of collapse. The aid agencies hope that by acting in unison and showing solidarity, they can convince the Taliban they have crossed a red line that makes it impossible for the NGOs to operate.\nAbout a third of the NGOs\u2019 staff are women, and seen as vital in providing services in a culturally appropriate way. The ban applies to NGOs, but does not as yet apply to the staff of UN agencies such as the World Food Programme and the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs.\nIn a bid to head off a ban, the aid agencies had held meetings with the Taliban leadership, giving assurances over female staff wearing the hijab and travelling extended distances only in the company of a male.\nBut the NGOs said the Taliban had ignored the undertakings and revoked the promises.\nThe move was seen as a decisive signal that Taliban had decided to reimpose all the repressive measures against women that it enforced in the 1990s when it was last in power, and in so doing finally buried the notion that the rural Pashtun conservative culture was no longer dominant in the Taliban leadership. Many had suggested the Taliban had reformed during their two decades out of power.\nLast week, the Taliban also banned women from attending university. Girls are already banned from secondary schools, and in November, women were banned from public gardens, gymnasiums and public baths.\nJan Egeland, chief executive of the Norwegian Refugee Council, admitted the temporary suspension of services had been difficult, but told the BBC: \u201cwe cannot work in an effective and qualitatively good enough manner with only male staff. They cannot deal directly with women according to the traditions in Afghanistan. We cannot function without a third of our staff.\n\u201cWe would disintegrate as a principled organisation if we compromised on this and stumbled along with only male staff. As I told the Taliban several times, we respect their traditional values and for us it is a fundamental value that we have gender equality in the workplace.\n\u201cWe cannot compromise on this one. If they want their population to have aid as they want, they have to nullify this decision. My heart is bleeding for those out in the open, freezing and starving in terrible conditions, and which we were planning to help next week. The Taliban are responsible for this from A to Z, and we have to call a spade a spade.\u201d\nApart from the NRC, Save the Children, the International Rescue Committee (IRC), Islamic Relief, Care, Christian Aid and World Vision have all said they are suspending aid, although some said they may yet provide aid if it is required to save a life.\nThe NGOs are critical to the provision of healthcare, education, child protection and nutrition services and support amid worsening conditions. Successive droughts and a freeze on development aid to Afghanistan badly affected the health system, and have left 11 million people in need of humanitarian food assistance.\nThe IRC, which employs 3,000 women in a staff of 8,000, said in a statement: \u201cThe exclusion of women from humanitarian service delivery will have catastrophic consequences for the Afghan people because our services depend on women workers.\u201d\nOne of the strongest reactions came from the German foreign minister, Annalena Baerbock, who said: \u201cWe will not accept that the Taliban are making humanitarian aid a pawn in their misogyny. They rob half the population of another fundamental right, violate humanitarian principles and endanger people\u2019s vital needs.\u201d\n\nTop US officials, including the secretary of state, Antony Blinken, and the charg\u00e9e d\u2019affaires to Afghanistan, Karen Decker, condemned the move.\nDecker, tweeting in the Dari language on Sunday, said: \u201cAs a representative of the largest donor of humanitarian assistance to Afghanistan, I feel I have the right to an explanation of how the Taliban intends to prevent women and children from starving, when women are no longer permitted to distribute assistance to other women and children.\u201d\nHer remarks triggered a response from the Taliban-led government\u2019s chief spokesperson, Zabihullah Mujahid, who said all institutions wanting to operate in the country were obliged to comply with its rules and regulations.\n\u201cWe do not allow anyone to talk rubbish or make threats regarding the decisions of our leaders under the title of humanitarian aid,\u201d he said in a tweet.\n\nThe Australian foreign minister, Penny Wong, condemned the \u201cappalling decision\u201d, saying on Twitter it \u201cseriously impacts the country\u2019s ability to deal with a major humanitarian crisis\u201d.\nSince the Taliban took over, government foreign aid stopped almost overnight. Sanctions on Taliban rulers, a halt on bank transfers and frozen billions in Afghanistan\u2019s currency reserves have already restricted access to global institutions. The aid agencies not only distribute food, but administer health clinics. According to the European Commission, by 2023, 28 million Afghans (out of a population of more than 39 million) will need humanitarian assistance, including 13 million children. Nearly 20 million people are hungry and nearly six million survive on less than one meal a day.\nThe ban on female students attending universities triggered demonstrations in several Afghan cities with many chanting \u201cwomen, life, freedom\u201d, the slogan adopted by opponents of the compulsory hijab in Afghanistan. But the protests lasted only minutes before police intervened, including female officers. The deputy prime minister for political affairs, Abdul Kabir, met to discuss the ban on women attending university with a delegation of the Union of Private Universities of Afghanistan, and told them the ban would be lifted soon. Similar promises about revoking the ban on girls attending secondary schools were made, but were never fulfilled.\n\nAt about midnight on Saturday in the western city of Herat, where earlier protesters were dispersed with water cannon, people opened their windows and chanted \u201cAllahu Akbar\u201d (God is the greatest) in solidarity with female students."

                    "body": "Steve Evans, the manager of Stevenage, acclaimed his League Two players\u2019 \u201chearts the size of Big Ben\u201d as they knocked Aston Villa, 59 places above them in the pyramid, out of the FA Cup in the biggest shock of an exhilarating weekend of third-round upsets. As Villa\u2019s new manager, Unai Emery, admitted he may need to start making greater demands of his players, who lost 2-1 after leading until Jamie Reid\u2019s 88th minute penalty, 3,000 Stevenage fans raucously celebrated reaching the fourth round for the first time in nine years.  Villa have now lost eight consecutive games in this competition, stretching back to 2016, but the glory belongs to Stevenage, whose highest ever finish was sixth in the third tier 11 years ago. Evans, the former Crawley Town and Boston United manager, said: \u201cIt\u2019s magical for the players, the chairman and for the town of Stevenage to see over 3,000 fans and, winning the way we did, it\u2019s the FA Cup and what dreams are made of. \u201cI said to the players they will have a dream they will talk to the kids and grandkids about it. I\u2019ve got grandkids and little Joseph, James and Mimi will be hearing about in the next few years.\u201d Morgan Sanson had given Villa a first-half lead but Emery, with a proud cup pedigree with Sevilla and PSG, criticised his players\u2019 lack of clinical finishing. To Stevenage\u2019s credit, they kept a tight shape, with a midfield square in front of a back four, and squeezed the space Villa were allowed to play in. After Leander Dendoncker was sent off for conceding the penalty, Stevenage went for broke and Dean Campbell smashed in the winner in the 90th minute. Evans added: \u201cWe stayed in the game and the gameplan all week was to make sure we were in the game at 75 minutes. If we were in the game at 75 minutes I knew we had an incredible, fit group and I could use the lads who have hearts the size of Big Ben.\u201d Villa\u2019s players were praised for their sportsmanship afterwards and Evans felt for World Cup winner Emi Mart\u00ednez, whom he had on loan at Rotherham United and was a substitute for this game. \u201cEmi gave us a hug afterwards,\u201d Evans said. \u201cIf you\u2019re Emi Mart\u00ednez, you\u2019ll be haunted. I looked at Ashley Young and you could see the hurt on his face, maybe the embarrassment.\u201d Emery said: \u201cI\u2019m upset, disappointed and sorry for our supporters. We have lost a very good opportunity to do something in the FA Cup. \u201cIt is a process and I will continue to be demanding. Maybe now, I need to be more demanding. I\u2019m very shocked. But it can happen when you have good chances to score but don\u2019t take them.\u201d"

                    "body": "Eddie Howe would later admit he was not really thirsty but that failed to prevent Newcastle\u2019s manager from unscrewing the top of the small bottle of water in front of him and taking a long, very slow, sip. It was such an obvious timewasting tactic that, by the time he put it back on the table, laughter filled the room. \u201cI\u2019m conveniently drinking my water,\u201d Howe joked after being asked whether he would prefer to finish in the Premier League\u2019s top four or win the Carabao Cup. The 45-year-old had evidently forgotten that, in an unguarded moment, after last Tuesday night\u2019s Carabao Cup win against Bournemouth, he had admitted: \u201cThe Premier League\u2019s our priority.\u201d  And so it surely should be. With Newcastle third as the top tier resumes after its hiatus for the World Cup, a place in next season\u2019s Champions League must feel almost within touching distance for the club\u2019s Saudi Arabian majority owners. An awful lot can change over the 23 games ahead but Howe appeared cautiously optimistic as he prepared for Monday\u2019s trip to Leicester. \u201cIt\u2019s in our hands,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019d like to think we\u2019re prepared for what\u2019s coming at us. I\u2019d like to think the team are ready to play in different ways and I don\u2019t mean just system-wise. \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure the second half of the season will be tougher but that\u2019s healthy. We\u2019re confident; we\u2019ll embrace the challenge.\u201d Allan Saint-Maximin, Newcastle\u2019s French winger, recently revealed he had spoken to his compatriot Marcus Thuram, the France and Borussia Monchengladbach forward, about the benefits of joining Newcastle. \u201cThanks Maxi,\u201d said Howe, who expects to finally welcome his \u00a360m Sweden striker Alexander Isak back from injury next month. \u201cThuram\u2019s one of the players I looked at during the World Cup but that\u2019s as far as it\u2019s gone.  \u201cI don\u2019t know what our window will look like. I\u2019ve got to be careful not to do something that unsettles the group yet you also don\u2019t want it to become stale. But it would be difficult to improve our starting XI without spending serious money and financial fair play rules will make that tough.\u201d Howe swiftly debunked suggestions that Newcastle might fund fresh purchases by selling Saint-Maximin. \u201cFor me, any time Maxi is unavailable is a disaster because he\u2019s unique,\u201d he said, expressing hope the winger has seen off the hamstring problems which interrupted the season\u2019s first half. \u201cHe\u2019s got skills no defender wants to face. Maxi\u2019s a massive player for us and there\u2019s so much more to come from him. \u201cFor me, he\u2019s the best dribbler in the Premier League. He\u2019s got the ability to put any opponent on the back foot. The team performed really well in his absence but he\u2019s undoubtedly got the qualities we\u2019re going to need in the second half of the season. When he\u2019s fully fit, Maxi\u2019s a key player from the off. He\u2019s absolutely not an impact sub.\u201d  In Howe\u2019s ideal word, Saint-Maximin and Brazil\u2019s Bruno Guimar\u00e3es would be exchanging passes with James Maddison at St James\u2019 Park. Leicester\u2019s England midfielder remains high on Howe\u2019s shopping list and although a deal next month may well be too difficult to complete, he did not dismiss the notion entirely. \u201cI never talk about other clubs\u2019 players,\u201d said Howe, who, despite frequently showering Jonjo Shelvey with praise, could conceivably sell the playmaker, who certain predecessors found high-maintenance when he was outside the first XI. \u201cBut \u2026 James Maddison\u2019s been absolutely brilliant this season \u2026 he\u2019s a great advert for the Premier League.\u201d Like it or not, Newcastle are in effect unofficial ambassadors for Saudi Arabia. At some point in the coming months they are expected to attend a warm-weather training camp in the new, lavishly futuristic Red Sea resort rapidly taking shape along the kingdom\u2019s west coast, 300 miles north of Jeddah. It is not intended to merely draw sun-starved northern Europeans towards its glorious winter climate, but to help change international perceptions of the country. That may seem an unrealistic ambition, but a year ago so too did the idea that Howe and Newcastle would now be giving J\u00fcrgen Klopp, Erik ten Hag, Antonio Conte, Graham Potter and company genuine cause for concern."

Thanks for following along and you can find our latest report on Rishi Sunak here:\n\n\n\n\n 6.37pm  \n\nLord McDonald, a former senior civil servant, said the reappointment of Suella Braverman as home secretary was a \u201cpolitical\u201d move by Rishi Sunak.\nSunak has been criticised for rehiring Braverman less than a week after she was sacked over a security breach.\nLord McDonald, who was head of the diplomatic service, said it was \u201cnot at all\u201d dishonourable for Sunak to ensure all factions were represented in his cabinet.\nAsked if six days on the backbenches was a short sentence for a breach of any kind, in civil service terms, he told the BBC: \u201cIt is, and six weeks is a rather short time to claim that that person had acquired massive and irreplaceable experience.\n\u201cSo it looks political, it is political, but this is within the prime minister\u2019s judgment and gift.\u201d\nLabour MP Chris Bryant has criticised Braverman for avoiding questions about her resignation.\n\n\nUpdated at 6.40pm BST\n\n\n 6.31pm  \n\nSir Keir Starmer met Bill Gates in parliament on Wednesday.\nThe billionaire Microsoft co-founder and Starmer discussed a range of issues including climate change and global health.\nA Labour spokesperson said: \u201cKeir Starmer was pleased to meet with Bill Gates today and discuss a number of issues of mutual concern including how the UK best supports global health and equitable development, and how we use the goal of net zero to invest in science and technology to deliver the jobs and growth of the future.\u201d\n\nUpdated at 6.40pm BST\n\n\n 6.22pm  \nDUP says it is 'ready' for new Stormont elections as Northern Ireland deadline nears\n\nThe DUP is \u201cready to fight\u201d in fresh Assembly elections, its leader, Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, said following talks with the Northern Ireland secretary Chris Heaton-Harris.\nHeaton-Harris was holding discussions with Stormont leaders as a deadline for calling another election in the region approaches.\nThe NI secretary has repeatedly warned that he will call a Stormont poll if Friday\u2019s deadline passes without a devolved executive being formed.\nThe DUP has refused to engage with the devolved institutions in Belfast in the wake of May\u2019s assembly election, meaning it has not been possible to form an executive.\nThe party\u2019s boycott is part of a campaign of opposition to the post-Brexit Northern Ireland Protocol and it says it will not return to power sharing until decisive action is taken to remove the protocol\u2019s economic barriers on trade between Great Britain and Northern Ireland.\nDonaldson told reporters in London there was \u201cstill some way to go\u201d in solving the problems over the protocol following his phone conversation with Heaton-Harris.\n\nUpdated at 6.41pm BST\n\n\n 6.13pm  \nOnline safety bill dropped, reports say\n\nThe online safety bill has been dropped from Commons business for the second time in four months despite pledges it would return \u201cin the autumn\u201d, PoliticsHome is reporting.\nThe bill was expected to have its third reading in the Commons on 1 November.\nThese stages were originally meant to take place in July but the process was delayed after the resignation of Boris Johnson as PM.\nThe Labour MP Lucy Powell has criticised the delay in light of the findings at the inquest of Molly Russell last month.\n\n\nUpdated at 6.41pm BST\n\n\n 6.01pm  \n\nJames Cleverly has been criticised by Labour for urging LGBT football fans to be \u201crespectful\u201d of Qatar if they visit the country for the World Cup which starts on 20 November.\nChris Bryant MP tweeted: \u201cRespect is a two way street. My worry is these ministers never say boo to authoritarian regimes where human rights are regularly trampled under foot.\n\u201cIf Qatar want to be accepted in the community of nations, they have to respect all communities of all nations.\u201d\nAnd Steve Reed, the shadow justice secretary, tweeted:\n\n\nUpdated at 6.42pm BST\n\n\n 5.49pm  \n\nArriving for talks with secretary of state Chris Heaton-Harris in Belfast, Sinn F\u00e9in\u2019s Michelle O\u2019Neill urged the DUP to drop its block on forming an executive.\n\u201cSo the clock is obviously ticking and we\u2019re very close to the Friday deadline,\u201d she said.\n\u201cI\u2019m here to meet the secretary of state and my number one priority is the restoration of the executive, that should also be the secretary of state\u2019s priority.\n\u201cThe people here deserve no less than a fully functioning executive, one that is going to get them get through the cost of living crisis, one that\u2019s going to fix and invest in our health service \u2013 that\u2019s where we need to be.\n\u201cAs this deadline looms it\u2019s just not acceptable for the DUP not to join the rest of us but they have an opportunity tomorrow and it\u2019s up to them to take that opportunity.\u201d\n\nUpdated at 6.39pm BST\n\n\n 5.39pm  \n\nKevin Foster, who was appointed minster of state at the Department for Transport last month by Liz Truss, has announced he is leaving the role after talks with Rishi Sunak.\n\n\n\n\n 5.30pm  \n\n\nRishi Sunak\u2019s boast at a Tunbridge Wells summer garden party of undoing Labour policy that \u201cshoved all the funding into deprived urban areas\u201d to give more to regions such as Kent looks likely to haunt him as his commitment to levelling up is questioned.\nAt Sunak\u2019s first prime minister\u2019s questions on Wednesday, the Labour leader, Keir Starmer, challenged him over the clip, filmed during the previous Conservative leadership race, which seemed to show his pride in diverting money from poor cities to wealthier towns such as Tunbridge Wells.\n\u201cI managed to start changing the funding formulas to make sure that areas like this are getting the funding they deserve,\u201d Sunak tells Tory party members at the summer event.\nTunbridge Wells is one of the UK\u2019s most affluent towns in one of the least deprived counties in England. Starmer asked why Sunak did not now \u201cdo the right thing and undo the changes he made to those funding formulas\u201d?\n\n\n\n\n\n 5.14pm  \n\nRishi Sunak and his family plan to move back into Downing Street.\nHe lived in the No 10 flat when he was chancellor in Boris Johnson\u2019s government, while the former PM inhabited the roomier No 11 flat.\nThe PM\u2019s spokesperson told Sky News: \u201cThey will be moving into the No 10 flat, where they used to live.\u201d\nAsked why No 10 and not the bigger No 11, she said: \u201cThey were very happy there.\u201d\n\nUpdated at 5.40pm BST\n\n\n 5.02pm  \n\nJames Duddridge has now tweeted to confirm that he was asked to leave his role as minister for international trade.\nHe said he was \u201cdisappointed\u201d but that he would be giving Rishi Sunak his \u201cfull support\u201d from the backbenches.\n\n\nUpdated at 5.40pm BST\n\n\n 5.00pm  \nSummary of the day so far\n\nHere\u2019s a roundup of today\u2019s developments:\n\nRishi Sunak has been accused of immediately breaking his pledge to restore government integrity by bringing Suella Braverman back as home secretary in exchange for a key endorsement for his leadership bid. Labour and the Liberal Democrats called for a Cabinet Office inquiry into national security concerns after Braverman, who was reinstated despite admitting leaking official documents.\nFracking will in effect remain banned under Sunak\u2019s government, his spokesperson confirmed on Wednesday, saying the new prime minister was committed to the policy in the 2019 manifesto. The confirmation came after the prime minister told the Commons that he \u201cstands by\u201d the manifesto, which put a moratorium on shale gas extraction.\nMinisters are to re-examine the pensions triple lock and increasing benefits in line with inflation over the next fortnight, according to No 10, after Sunak delayed the announcement of the government\u2019s fiscal plans from 31 October to 17 November. The Treasury has said the new date will now be a full autumn statement.\nThe Northern Ireland secretary, Chris Heaton-Harris, is holding last-ditch talks with the region\u2019s party leaders to try to restore devolved government and avert an assembly election. If the meetings in Belfast on Wednesday do not yield a breakthrough by Thursday that revives power sharing, Heaton-Harris is expected to call an election, tipping Northern Ireland into further uncertainty.\nWomen\u2019s groups have reacted with concern and anger over the low representation of women in the new cabinet. Sunak removed 11 members of his predecessor\u2019s top team on Tuesday as he put together a cabinet that he said \u201creflects a united party\u201d by showcasing \u201call the talents\u201d. Under the changes, however, fewer than a quarter of all people \u2013 about 23% \u2013 able to attend cabinet meetings will be women.\nThe foreign secretary James Cleverly has been criticised for telling gay football fans they should show respect to Qatar, which criminalises their sexuality, when attending the World Cup in the emirate. Cleverly said Qatar was willing to make compromises to allow people it would normally persecute to attend the tournament, which kicks off on 20 November.\n\n\nUpdated at 5.40pm BST\n\n\n 4.43pm  \nAlec Shelbrooke leaves as defence procurement minister\n\nAlec Shelbrooke says he will be returning to the back benches and leaving his role as a minister of state for defence procurement.\n\n\n\n\n 4.41pm  \nJames Duddridge sacked as trade minister\n\nJames Duddridge has lost his job as trade minister as Rishi Sunak continues his government reshuffle.\nDuddridge said he had told Sunak that he would support the government \u201cloyally\u201d from the back benches. \n\n\n\n 4.28pm  \n\nWomen\u2019s groups have reacted with concern and anger over the low representation of women in the new cabinet.\nRishi Sunak removed 11 members of his predecessor\u2019s top team on Tuesday as he put together a cabinet that he said \u201creflects a united party\u201d by showcasing \u201call the talents\u201d. Under the changes, however, fewer than a quarter of all people \u2013 about 23% \u2013 able to attend cabinet meetings will be women.\nThis is down from nearly a third at the start of Liz Truss\u2019s premiership and is lower than under Boris Johnson, at 24%, and Theresa May, at 30%. The figure has been falling since its highest ever rate under Tony Blair in 2006-07, when the proportion of women in cabinet was 36%.\n\n\u201cWomen remain significantly underrepresented in parliament where just 34% MPs are women and, while progress has been made, the pace is glacial,\u201d said Amy Whitelock Gibbs, the interim director of policy at the Fawcett Society. \n\nWe need to ensure women, from all backgrounds, are not just in the halls of Westminster but also around the cabinet table.\n\nGibbs said the presence of female MPs in the rooms of power where decisions were being made had \u201cundoubtedly transformed our laws and policies\u201d, from equal pay to domestic violence legislation.\n\nThat is why, as the cost-of-living crisis intensifies and has a disproportionate impact on women, we were disappointed to see the proportion of women in cabinet drop. We urge the government to put women at the heart of its economic recovery.\n\nRead the full story here:\n\n\n\n\n 4.06pm  \n\nA spokesperson for the Labour leader, Sir Keir Starmer, has said there are \u201cconversations ongoing\u201d between Labour\u2019s chief whip and the MP Nadia Whittome regarding a tweet that said Rishi Sunak becoming prime minister \u201cisn\u2019t a win for Asian representation\u201d.\nIn a tweet that has since been deleted, Whittome said Sunak becoming PM \u201cisn\u2019t a win for Asian representation\u201d due to his wealth and politics. She added \u201cblack, white or Asian: if you work for a living, he is not on your side\u201d.\nThe Labour leader\u2019s spokesperson has confirmed that Whittome was instructed to delete the tweet, adding that Sunak becoming the first British Asian prime minister was a \u201cgreat thing\u201d and something the country \u201cshould be proud of\u201d.\nAsked about Whittome\u2019s tweet on Sky News, Starmer said he was \u201cvery pleased\u201d to welcome the first British Asian PM and described it as a \u201creal milestone\u201d for the country.\n\n\nUpdated at 4.28pm BST\n\n\n 3.54pm  \n\nOn becoming Tory leader this week, Rishi Sunak said:\n\nIt is the greatest privilege of my life to be able to serve the party I love, and give back to the country I owe so much to.\n\nDuring his final prime minister\u2019s questions in the summer, Boris Johnson said:\n\nThe last few years have been the greatest privilege of my life, and it\u2019s true that I helped to get the biggest Tory majority for 40 years and a huge realignment in UK politics.\n\nAnd Keir Starmer, when elected as leader of Labour in 2020, intoned:\n\nIt is the honour and privilege of my life. I will do my utmost to guide us through these difficult times, to serve all our communities and to strive for the good of our country.\n\nIt appears that owning up to your privilege is all the rage. Confessing to this sort of privilege is a shameless humblebrag. Some onlookers might suppose, after all, that the greatest privilege of Sunak\u2019s life is owning many millions of pounds. Does the phrase even aspire to work as rhetorical misdirection, to distract the listener from whatever other privileges the speaker might have enjoyed?\nWe unpack the real meaning of the most overused word in politics. Read the rest of the story here:\n\n\nUpdated at 4.01pm BST\n\n\n 3.38pm  \n\nRishi Sunak\u2019s first appearance at PMQs was a strong performance that will force the Labour leader Keir Starmer to raise his game, Sebastian Payne from the Financial Times writes.\n\n\n\n\n 3.17pm  \n\nScotland\u2019s deputy first minister, John Swinney, has criticised the chancellor Jeremy Hunt\u2019s decision to delay the government\u2019s fiscal plans, claiming the \u201cunwelcome and unnecessary\u201d postponement would \u201csimply create more uneconomic uncertainty\u201d.\nThe delay risked affecting the Scottish government\u2019s own budget plans \u201cas we will now need to wait two and a half weeks longer than previously proposed to see what the effect of UK tax and spending plans will be on devolved budgets\u201d, he said.\nHe added:\n\nAbove all, it is essential that the chancellor heeds warnings not to impose renewed austerity, which would only worsen the extreme pressures already being faced by people and businesses as a result of inflation, rising interest rates and other economic factors.\nThe Scottish parliament will be kept informed regarding the timing of the Emergency Budget Review statement and will be consulted on any potential impact the UK government\u2019s delay will have on the timing of the 2023-24 Scottish budget.\n\n\nUpdated at 3.30pm BST\n\n\n 3.11pm  \n\nThe shadow work and pensions secretary, Jonathan Ashworth, has responded to Rishi Sunak\u2019s refusal to commit to the triple lock on state pensions. He said:\n\nOlder people are paying the price for the Conservatives\u2019 economic mess. Rishi Sunak stood on a manifesto in 2019 on a pledge to keep the triple lock.\nNow he\u2019s threatening that promise to Britain\u2019s retirees. With pensioners struggling under the Conservatives cost of living crisis, it\u2019s clear that Rishi Sunak is not on their side.\n\n\nUpdated at 3.18pm BST\n\n\n 3.08pm  \n\nThe foreign secretary, James Cleverly, has been criticised for telling gay football fans they should show respect to Qatar, which criminalises their sexuality, when attending the World Cup in the emirate.\nCleverly said Qatar was willing to make compromises to allow people it would normally persecute to attend the tournament, which kicks off on 20 November. On Tuesday the prominent British LGBTQ campaigner Peter Tatchell claimed he had been arrested in Qatar for highlighting the country\u2019s stance.\n\nCleverly said:\n\nI have spoken to the Qatari authorities in the past about gay football fans going to watch the World Cup and how they will treat our fans and international fans. They want to make sure that football fans are safe, secure and enjoy themselves. And they know that that means they are going to have to make some compromises in terms of what is an Islamic country with a very different set of cultural norms to our own.\nOne of the things I would say for football fans is, you know, please do be respectful of the host nation. They are trying to ensure that people can be themselves and enjoy the football, and I think with a little bit of flex and compromise at both ends, it can be a safe, secure and exciting World Cup.\n\nThe shadow digital, culture, media and sport secretary, Lucy Powell, called Cleverly\u2019s comments \u201cshockingly tone-deaf\u201d.\nShe said:\n\nSport should be open to all. Many fans will feel they can\u2019t attend this tournament to cheer on their team because of Qatar\u2019s record on human rights, workers and LGBT+ rights. The government should be challenging Fifa on how they\u2019ve put fans in this position, and ensuring the full safety of all fans attending, not defending discriminatory values.\n\nRead the full story here:\n\n\nUpdated at 3.09pm BST\n\n\n 2.48pm  \n\nRishi Sunak\u2019s commitment to reinstate the fracking ban has neutralised one of Labour\u2019s key attack lines, as it is hugely unpopular in the marginal seats they hope to contest in the next election, but Ed Miliband, the shadow climate secretary, did not seem impressed by the promise.\nHe said:\n\nLast week Rishi Sunak voted against Labour\u2019s fracking ban, but this week his spokespeople tell us he is in favour of the temporary moratorium on fracking in the Conservative manifesto.\nWhatever their latest position, the truth is that that the Tories have shown that they cannot be trusted on the issue of fracking. The only way to guarantee that fracking will be banned for good is to elect a Labour government.\nAnd by doubling down today on the onshore wind ban, Rishi Sunak is showing that he offers more of the same after twelve years of failed Conservative energy policy, which has made energy bills too high for families and weakened Britain\u2019s energy security.\u201d\n\n\nUpdated at 2.52pm BST\n\n\n 2.45pm  \n\nStarmer also challenged Rishi Sunak over his decision to reappoint Suella Braverman as home secretary, after her resignation just one week ago.\n\n\nUpdated at 2.48pm BST\n\n\n 2.33pm  \n\nKeir Starmer launched an attack on Rishi Sunak at PMQs, pointing out the new prime minister lost the initial Tory leadership race to Liz Truss \u201cwho herself got beaten by a lettuce\u201d.\n\n\nUpdated at 2.41pm BST\n\n\n 2.18pm  \n\nFracking will remain effectively banned under Rishi Sunak\u2019s government, his spokesperson confirmed on Wednesday, saying the new prime minister was committed to the policy in the 2019 manifesto.\nThe confirmation came after the prime minister told the Commons that he \u201cstands by\u201d the manifesto which put a moratorium on shale gas extraction.\nThe decision is another rebuff to policies launched under Liz Truss, as well as full rewriting of her fiscal plans. Under Truss\u2019s short-lived government, she lifted the moratorium amid significant divisions in the parliamentary party.\nA significant number of MPs, including in the cabinet, have spoken out against fracking, including the chancellor Jeremy Hunt who said in June that it would create \u201cenormous disruption and environmental damage for little if any economic benefit\u201d.\nRead the full story here:\n\n\n\n\n 2.16pm  \n\nThe government is now spending almost \u00a37 million a day housing asylum seekers in hotels and the cost could continue to rise, MPs heard.The Commons Home Affairs Committee was told \u00a35.6 million a day was being spent on hotels for people who have arrived in the UK and have submitted a claim, with an additional \u00a31.2 million paid to house Afghan refugees who fled the Taliban takeover while long-term accommodation is sought, PA reports. The total \u00a36.8 million is over \u00a32 million more than the government said it was spending in February (\u00a34.7 million).Asked by committee chairwoman Dame Diana Johnson if the cost was likely to go up again, Abi Tierney, director general of the passport office and UK visas and immigration, replied: \u201cYes.\u201d MPs also learned the Home Office has only processed 4% of asylum claims by those who crossed the Channel last year and officials admitted the interception rate made by French police of those attempting the journey has fallen.Concerns were also raised about conditions at the Manston Airport site in Kent, which is meant to be a short-term holding facility to process migrants when they arrive in the UK.MPs heard the number of people arriving was \u201coutstripping\u201d the capacity of the site and some were being held there for as long as a month, compared with the 24 hours intended.\n\n\n\n 1.55pm  \n\nSir Keir Starmer\u2019s spokesperson has said that Labour wants the cabinet secretary to offer a substantive response to its letter about Suella Braverman after the shadow home secretary, Yvette Cooper, wrote to Simon Case demanding an investigation \u201cinto the extent of this and other possible security breaches\u201d.\nHe said: \n\nClearly, if there is content of the inquiry that has to be retained, that is understandable. If there was advice that went to the prime minister that there was a raised eyebrow within the civil service about this appointment, then absolutely that is something that should be in the public domain. It is perfectly possible to do that whilst preserving any operational matters that could be compromised in doing so.\n\n\nUpdated at 2.01pm BST\n\n\n 1.47pm  \n\nThe Northern Ireland secretary, Chris Heaton-Harris, is holding last-ditch talks with the region\u2019s party leaders to try to restore devolved government and avert an assembly election.\nIf the meetings in Belfast on Wednesday do not yield a breakthrough that revives power-sharing on Thursday Heaton-Harris is expected to call an election, tipping Northern Ireland into further uncertainty.\nGloom shrouded the talks because the Democratic Unionist party (DUP) has vowed to continue its boycott of the Stormont executive unless the party\u2019s objections to the post-Brexit Irish Sea border are resolved.\n\nThe impasse raised the spectre of an election in December, which parties and voters do not appear to want, just seven months after the last one. Sinn F\u00e9in overtook the DUP as the biggest party in the May election, a landmark result, but its deputy leader, Michelle O\u2019Neill, did not become first minister because the DUP\u2019s boycott.\nThe crisis has deepened a sense of political malaise in Northern Ireland and raised questions about the viability of power-sharing institutions established by the 1998 Good Friday agreement. The assembly has not functioned for four of the past six years.\nHeaton-Harris, who was reappointed to his post by Rishi Sunak on Tuesday, has repeatedly warned he would call an election if no executive was formed by 28 October, a legal deadline. He repeated the threat on Wednesday.\nRead the full story here:\n\n\nUpdated at 1.51pm BST\n\n\n 1.41pm  \n\nThe Guardian\u2019s Aubrey Allegretti has the full report on Rishi Sunak\u2019s first PMQs:\nRishi Sunak has been accused of immediately breaking his pledge to restore government integrity by bringing Suella Braverman back as home secretary in exchange for a key endorsement for his leadership bid.\nComing under pressure in his first prime minister\u2019s questions, Sunak did not deny that civil servants had raised concerns about one of the most senior roles handed out in his cabinet reshuffle on Tuesday.\nKeir Starmer, the Labour leader, questioned Sunak\u2019s commitment to probity and professionalism after Braverman was brought back into the government despite \u201cdeliberately pinging around sensitive Home Office documents\u201d from a personal email account.\nStarmer said Sunak was \u201cso weak he\u2019s done a grubby deal trading national security because he was scared to lose another leadership election\u201d, vocalising a concern some Conservative MPs have raised privately over the past 24 hours.\nBraverman was forced to quit last week for breaching the ministerial code, and three days later, after Liz Truss\u2019s government had collapsed, endorsed Sunak. The move was seen as a crucial win for Sunak, allowing him to demonstrate he had support from the right of the party.\nStarmer asked Sunak if she had been right to resign last week, and said the home secretary\u2019s integrity and professionalism should be \u201cbeyond question\u201d.\nThe prime minster said Braverman had made an error of judgment and recognised her mistake, adding: \n\nThat\u2019s why I was delighted to welcome her back into a united cabinet that brings experience and stability to the heart of government.\n\nAsked if officials had raised concerns about the appointment, given the cabinet secretary, Simon Case, was said to have been furious, Sunak dodged the question and said he had already \u201caddressed the issue\u201d. Starmer said the evasion showed that while there was a \u201cnew Tory at the top\u201d, Sunak had demonstrated he would put the \u201cparty first and country second\u201d.\nRead the full report here:\n\n\n\n\n 1.38pm  \n\nHere\u2019s the clip of the chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, confirming that his fiscal statement has been postponed until 17 November.\nIt was previously scheduled for 31 October but will now be a \u201cfull autumn statement\u201d to reflect the \u2018most accurate possible economic forecasts\u2019, he said.\n\n\nUpdated at 1.51pm BST\n\n\n 1.34pm  \n\nAnd here are some more lines from Downing Street, including that Rishi Sunak will appoint a new independent adviser on ministerial interests.\n\n\nUpdated at 1.36pm BST\n\n\n 1.30pm  \n\nThe chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, is seeking to fill a fiscal shortfall of \u00a335bn when he delivers his autumn statement next month, officials have told Bloomberg.\nThe government has drawn up a menu of 104 options to cut spending as they seek to get the public finances back onto a sustainable track, according to the officials.\n\nUpdated at 1.52pm BST\n\n\n 1.28pm  \n\nHere are some more lines from the Downing Street briefing, from the Guardian\u2019s Jessica Elgot.\n\nDowning Street declined to get into reports that officials were concerned over the reappointment of Suella Braverman as home secretary.\nAsked if officials had raised concerns about the matter, a No 10 spokesperson said:\n\nI don\u2019t as standard get into discussing the advice that ministers nor prime ministers receive from their officials, that would not be proper, but certainly I don\u2019t recognise reports as regards the cabinet secretary.\n\nThey added that the PM is not committing to the triple-lock on state pensions. The spokesperson said:\n\nThat is something that is going to be wrapped up into the fiscal statement, we wouldn\u2019t comment ahead of any fiscal statements or budgets.\nBut what I can say is he has shown through his record as chancellor is that he will do what\u2019s right and compassionate for the most vulnerable.\n\n\nUpdated at 1.52pm BST\n\n\n 1.26pm  \n\nThe moratorium on fracking has been restored, Downing Street has now confirmed.\nThe PM\u2019s official spokesperson said Rishi Sunak was committed to the effective ban on fracking set out in the Conservative party\u2019s 2019 general election manifesto.\n\n\n\n 1.24pm  \n\nLabour has called for an investigation into Rishi Sunak\u2019s comments during the summer Tory leadership election on funnelling public money out of \u201cdeprived urban areas\u201d.\nThe shadow levelling up secretary Lisa Nandy has written to her counterpart, Michael Gove, asking for an independent investigation to establish which funding formulas were changed, the New Statesman reports.\nSunak was filmed speaking to Conservative party members in Tunbridge Wells over the summer where he admitted taking money from deprived urban areas in order to give it to other parts of the country.\nIn her letter, Nandy wrote:\n\nThe Conservative government was elected in 2019 on a flagship promise to level up parts of the country that had experienced relative economic decline.\n[Sunak\u2019s claim] could not be more serious. The prime minister has admitted that when he was chancellor, he fixed the rules to funnel taxpayers\u2019 money from \u2018deprived\u2019 to more affluent parts of the country. This is the complete opposite of levelling up. The prime minister has no mandate from the electorate to reverse the commitments made in 2019. His admission undermines the trust and confidence of the public and shatters the legitimacy of this government. It is a warning sign that Rishi Sunak is not on the side of working people.\n\nJake Berry, who yesterday left his role as Conservative party chair ahead of Sunak\u2019s cabinet reshuffle, said Sunak \u201csays one thing and does another\u201d.\n\n\nUpdated at 1.53pm BST\n\n\n 1.16pm  \nSunak 'to reinstate ban on fracking'\n\nRishi Sunak has said he will reinstate the nationwide ban on shale gas fracking during his first PMQs.\nSunak told MPs he \u201cstands by\u201d the Conservative party\u2019s 2019 manifesto commitment that banned fracking, a ban that was lifted by his predecessor Liz Truss.\nSunak\u2019s pledge came after a question by the Green party MP Caroline Lucas, who later tweeted this:\n\nA government source has confirmed to the Financial Times that Truss\u2019s decision on allowing fracking will be reversed.\n\nUpdated at 1.17pm BST\n\n\n 1.10pm  \n\nRishi Sunak answered questions from the Labour leader, Keir Starmer, at PMQs for the first time.\nHere is the exchange in full:\n\n\nUpdated at 1.13pm BST\n\n\n 1.03pm  \n\nThe shadow home secretary, Yvette Cooper, gave a blistering speech in the Commons after PMQs, claiming the appointment of home secretary, Suella Braverman, was a matter of the \u201cprotection of our national security\u201d.\nBraverman appeared to have left the chamber before Labour\u2019s urgent question about her resignation and reappointment.\nThe home secretary had \u201crun away from basic accountability to this hhouse\u201d, Cooper said. She added:\n\nMy questions are about security breaches and the protection of our national security. They are questions to the home secretary who was here just five minutes and who left.\n\nMinister for the Cabinet Office Jeremy Quin answered Cooper\u2019s question instead, saying that the home secretary had made an \u201cerror of judgment\u201d and then \u201crecognised her mistake\u201d and \u201ctook accountability\u201d for her actions.\nQuin said:\n\nThe ministerial code allows for a range of sanctions where mistakes have been made. The home secretary recognised her mistake, raised the matter and stepped down. Her resignation was accepted by the then prime minister. Ministerial appointments are a matter solely for the prime minister. \n\nHe said it was time to \u201clook to the future\u201d and that the PM had appointed a team of ministers to lead the country through the issues it faced.\n\nUpdated at 1.11pm BST\n\n\n 12.54pm  \n\nStephen Kinnock (Lab) accuses Sunak of being prepared to \u201cshamelessly swap red boxes for political support\u201d.\nHe says there are \u201cserious consequences to all this horse trading\u201d and asks whether Sunak sought advice on security concerns about Gavin Williamson \u201cgiven he was sacked in 2019 for leaking sensitive information related to our national security?\u201d\nSunak says this happened four years ago, when Labour was busy supporting Jeremy Corbyn \u2013 who had wanted to \u201cabolish the nuclear deterrent, leave Nato and scrap our armed forces\u201d \u2013 and that he will not take any lectures on national security.\n\nUpdated at 12.57pm BST\n\n\n 12.50pm  \n\nRichard Burgon (Lab) says Sunak knows only too well that the super-rich can easily afford to pay more in taxes.\nHe says a nurse would have to work \u201cover 20,000 years\u201d in order to match Sunak\u2019s vast wealth. He adds:\n\nRather than announce a new wave of cuts and austerity, wouldn\u2019t it be fairer for the prime minister to introduce wealth taxes on the very richest in our society?\n\nSunak says the government will always support hard-working nurses, which is why it is introducing bursaries and providing more training and \u201cvery strong pay increases\u201d.\nHe adds that future \u201cdifficult decisions\u201d will be approached in a way that is \u201cfair and compassionate\u201d.\n\nUpdated at 12.56pm BST\n\n\n 12.43pm  \n\nSuella Braverman has left the Commons as the shadow home secretary, Yvette Cooper, asks an urgent question on Braverman\u2019s reappointment.\n\n\nUpdated at 12.55pm BST\n\n\n 12.42pm  \n\nJanet Daby (Lab), who describes the Tory government as \u201ctopsy turby\u201d, says her inbox has been full of emails from constituents writing about their wages simply not going far enough, as well as emails about rents, energy prices and mortgages going up. \nShe says her constituents have been writing to her to demand a general election and asks the PM when there will be an election.\nSunak replies that he has already addressed the subject, but that \u201cinflation is the enemy\u201d. He adds:\n\nIt makes everyone poorer, it erodes savings. That\u2019s why it will be a priority of our government to grip and reduce inflation and provide support to those who need it as we do.\n\n\n\n\n 12.36pm  \n\nThe Green Party MP Caroline Lucas asks if Sunak will reverse the green light Liz Truss gave to fracking.\nThe PM says he is proud that his government passed the landmark environmental act for the natural environment and that he is committed to delivering on all those ambitions.\nSunak says:\n\nWe will deliver on what we said at Cop because we care deeply about passing our children and environment in a better state than we found it ourselves.\n\n\nUpdated at 12.39pm BST\n\n\n 12.32pm  \n\nBlackford says Sunak appointed Suella Braverman to the Home Office because of a \u201csleazy backroom deal\u201d to shore up his own position. He describes the move as \u201ca return to the sleazy and scandal and ghosts of cabinets\u201d.\nHe asks the PM if he will admit his mistakes and sack Braverman for her data breach.\nIn response, Sunak says he was pleased to have spoken with Scotland\u2019s first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, last night and that he wishes to work constructively with the Scottish government.\n\nUpdated at 12.40pm BST\n\n\n 12.28pm  \nSunak refuses to commit to raising benefits in line with inflation\n\nThe SNP leader at Westminster, Ian Blackford, congratulates Sunak on becoming the first British Asian prime minister. The symbolism of this achievement is to be \u201cwarmly welcomed\u201d by everyone, he says.\nHe asks Sunak if he will reassure people and guarantee that benefits will rise in line with inflation in his upcoming budget.\nSunak does not answer the question directly, but says he has \u201calways acted in a way to protect the most vulnerable\u201d.\nHe adds that he will \u201ccontinue to act like that in the weeks ahead\u201d, but does not commit to a rise.\nSunak says:\n\nI always acted in a way to protect the most vulnerable that\u2019s because it is the right thing to do and those are the values of our compassionate party.\nI can absolutely reassure him and give him that commitment that we will continue to act like that in the weeks ahead.\n\n\nUpdated at 12.29pm BST\n\n\n 12.25pm  \n\nSunak says he is the first to admit that mistakes were made. He says the difference between him and the Labour leader is that he was honest over the summer about the difficulties the country faced, but Starmer was not.\nHe says:\n\nHe promised his party he would borrow billions and billions of pounds, he told his party what it wanted to hear. Leadership is not selling fairy tales, it is confronting challenges and that is what the public will get from this government.\n\nStarmer uses his final question to call for a general election. He points out that Sunak was beaten in the summer leadership contest by Liz Truss \u2013 who herself was \u201cbeaten by a lettuce\u201d.\nHe says:\nHe claims he wants to level up the north but then he posts about trying to funnel vital investment away from deprived areas.\nStarmer adds:\n\nHe\u2019s not on the side of working people. That\u2019s why the only time he ran in a competitive election he got trounced by the former prime minister who herself got beaten by a lettuce.\n\n\nUpdated at 12.28pm BST\n\n\n 12.21pm  \n\nStarmer says Sunak \u201cpretends he\u2019s on the side of working people\u201d. In private, he says something \u201cvery different\u201d, the Labour leader says.\nHe goes on to talk about the video which emerged in the summer of Sunak in Tunbridge Wells saying he diverted public money from \u201cdeprived urban areas\u201d.\nStarmer asks:\n\nRather than apologise or pretend he meant something else, why doesn\u2019t he do the right thing and undo the changes he made to those funding formulas?\n\nSunak responds by saying that Starmer \u201crarely leaves north London\u201d. He adds:\n\nIf he does, he will know that there are deprived areas in our rural communities, in our coastal communities, and across the south.\n\n\n\n\n 12.18pm  \n\nStarmer goes on to attack Sunak on non-dom statuses, saying the government \u201callows very rich people to live here but register abroad for tax purposes\u201d. He says:\n\nI don\u2019t need to explain to the prime minister how non-dom status works \u2013 he already knows all about that.\n\nHe calls for the PM to get rid of such statuses, adding:\n\nWhy doesn\u2019t he put his money where his mouth is?\n\nIn response, Sunak says he will \u201chave to take difficult decisions to restore economic stability\u201d \u2013 and says more will be revealed in the autumn statement.\nHe says the goverment will always protect the most vulnerable, as it did in Covid.\n\nUpdated at 12.24pm BST\n\n\n 12.16pm  \n\nStarmer says Sunak has \u201cdone a grubby deal\u201d trading national security because he was scared to lose another leadership election. \nThere may be a new Tory at the top but with Tories, it\u2019s always \u201cparty first, country second\u201d, Starmer says. \nSunak responds to Starmer\u2019s assertion and suggests perhaps the Labour leader should explain why a few years ago he was supporting the member of Islington North, a reference to Jeremy Corbyn.\n\n\n\n 12.14pm  \n\nSunak replies he has already addressed the issue of the home secretary\u2019s reappointment.\nSunak says he hopes Starmer will welcome the news today that there are \u201cover 15,000 new police officers\u201d on our streets and that the home secretary will support them to tackle burglaries.\nMeanwhile, he says, Labour \u201cwill be backing the lunatic protesting fringe that are stopping working people carrying on with their lives\u201d.\n\n\n\n 12.13pm  \n\nStarmer points out that Sunak pledged integrity, professionalism and accountability in his statement outside Downing Street yesterday. He says:\n\n But then, with his first act, he appointed a home secretary who was sacked by his predecessor a week ago for deliberately pinging around sensitive Home Office documents from her personal account. \n\nStarmer goes on to say that his experience running the Crown Prosecution Service means he knows firsthand how important it is to have a home secretary \u201cwhose integrity and professionalism are beyond question\u201d.\nHe asks if officials have raised concerns about his decision to appoint Braverman.\n\n\n\n 12.10pm  \nBraverman 'made an error of judgment', says Sunak\n\nStarmer asks Sunak if Suella Braverman was right to resign last week for breach of security. Sunak replies:\n\nThe home secretary made an error of judgment but she recognised that she raised the matter and she accepted her mistake.\n\nBraverman will be focused on \u201ccracking down on criminals, on defending our borders\u201d, he adds.\n\nUpdated at 12.12pm BST\n\n\n 12.08pm  \n\nThe Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer welcomes Rishi Sunak and says the first British Asian prime minister is a \u201csignificant moment in our national story\u201d.\nIt is \u201ca reminder that for all the challenges we face as a country, Britain is a place where people of all races and all beliefs can fulfil their dreams\u201d Starmer says. It\u2019s part of what makes us all so proud to be British, he adds.\n\n\n\n 12.05pm  \n\nDr Alan Whitehead (Lab) begins by congratulating Rishi Sunak on his new post and of being the first PM of a South Asian heritage.\nHe asks if Sunak has changed his mind about campaigning to prohibit the development of onshore wind, which he says is the cheapest form of power available to us in the country.\nSunak replies by saying that he \u201csticks by what we said in our manifesto\u201d, adding: \n\nThe important thing is to focus on our long term energy security. That means more renewables, more offshore wind, and indeed more nuclear. That\u2019s what this government wants.\n\n\n\n\n 12.03pm  \n\nRishi Sunak begins his first PMQs with the standard statement about his engagements, that he had meetings with ministerial colleagues in addition to his duties in the House.\n\n\n\n 11.57am  \nSunak to face his first PMQs\n\nRishi Sunak is about to begin his first Commons appearance as prime minister. \n\n\n\n 11.50am  \n\nThe foreign secretary, James Cleverly, defended Rishi Sunak\u2019s decision to appoint Suella Braverman as home secretary after she resigned over security reasons one week ago. \nBraverman handed in her resignation to then prime minister, Liz Truss, after sending a confidential email from her personal email address, breaking ministerial code. \nCleverly said Braverman had \u201cmade a mistake\u201d and Sunak wished to see the home secretary \u2018see through\u2019 her robust plans for policing and immigration.\n\n\n\n\n 11.46am  \nLabour granted urgent question on Braverman appointment\n\nLabour has been granted an urgent question in the Commons later on Wednesday, with the party due to ask the home secretary Suella Braverman to make a statement on her resignation and reappointment.\nThe shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper will ask Braverman \u201cto make a statement on her resignation and reappointment as home secretary\u201d.\nThe Commons will hear the question after PMQ this lunchtime.\n\nUpdated at 11.47am BST\n\n\n 11.44am  \n\nRishi Sunak has been pictured leaving No 10 for the House of Commons to attend his first Prime Minister\u2019s Questions.\n\n\n\n\n\n 11.37am  \n\nThe chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, announcing his decision to delay his fiscal statement, also defended the appointment of Suella Braverman as home secretary a week after she was forced out of the role.\nAsked if he was happy with the reappointment and whether he trusted Braverman, he told reporters:\n\nShe apologised for her mistakes. She\u2019s been fully accountable for those mistakes, she stepped down as home secretary. But from the point of view of people at home, who want stability in the economy, they also need to see a united Conservative party and that\u2019s why the prime minister has put together a cabinet of all the talents.\n\n\n\nUpdated at 11.42am BST\n\n\n 11.34am  \n\nThe new environment secretary, Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Coffey, has said that protecting the environment will be at the heart of her mission in her new role.\nThis may not seem like a significant statement but her predecessor, Ranil Jayawardena, initially claimed his role was mostly about supporting economic growth and cutting red tape for farmers.\nHer statement could signal hope that she is moving away from divisive policies such as scrapping nature-friendly farming incentives, banning solar farms and attacking the RSPB. She has also vowed to work with environment groups to protect nature \u2013 perhaps meaning the tensions between the department and groups including the RSPB and national trust could be soothed.\nShe told the Guardian:\n\nI am delighted to return to Defra, this time as secretary of state.\nAs the prime minister set out, protecting our environment is at heart of our manifesto. I will work closely with rural communities, farmers, industry and the champions of our environment to strengthen our natural environment and support our thriving food and farming sector. I look forward to resuming our work to protect nature and deliver a stronger rural economy.\n\n\n\nUpdated at 11.42am BST\n\n\n 11.29am  \n\nThe chancellor Jeremy Hunt has insisted postponing the fiscal statement was the right move to ensure the \u201cvery, very difficult decisions\u201d required \u201cstand the test of time\u201d.\nHe told reporters:\n\nThe OBR also want to make sure that their forecasts are the most accurate possible and there have been a lot of changes even in the last 48 hours.\nThis is my recommendation to the prime minister as the best way to ensure that the decisions that we take, these very, very difficult decisions, are ones that stand the test of time and give us the best chance of giving people security over the mortgages, over their jobs, over the cost-of-living concerns that everyone has.\n\nHe added that he is willing to make \u201cpolitically embarrassing\u201d choices. He said:\n\nI\u2019ve demonstrated in the short time that I\u2019ve been chancellor that I\u2019m willing to take decisions very quickly and I\u2019m willing to make choices that are politically embarrassing if they\u2019re the right thing to do for the country, if they\u2019re in the national interest.\nNow we have a new prime minister and the prospect of much longer-term stability for the economy and the country. In that context a short two-and-a-half week delay is the best way we will make sure that it is the right decisions we take.\n\n\n\n\n 11.23am  \n\nThe SNP has said Rishi Sunak\u2019s record is a serious cause for concern for households and public service, as the prime minister warned of \u201cdifficult decisions\u201d ahead with major spending cuts expected to be laid out soon.\nSunak\u2019s time in office was already a clear sign of the looming threat facing families, the SNP said, highlighting the former chancellor\u2019s decision to scrap the \u00a320-a-week uplift to Universal Credit which slashed the incomes of 6 million people by \u00a31,040 a year.\nThe SNP\u2019s Westminster deputy leader Kirsten Oswald said:\n\nHis record in office is already a serious cause for concern for what\u2019s on the horizon for struggling families and businesses. From slashing Universal Credit, imposing an extreme Brexit, refusing to deliver meaningful support as the cost of living crisis worsened, and raising taxes on everyone else while his own family avoided them, Rishi Sunak shares the blame for the economic crisis and the hardship facing millions of people across Scotland and the UK.\n\n\n\n\n 11.15am  \n\nThe chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, has confirmed that his fiscal statement has been postponed to 17 November. Previously scheduled for 31 October, the statement will now be a \u201cfull autumn statement\u201d to reflect the \u201cmost accurate possible economic forecasts\u201d.\nHe told reporters:\n\nMy number one priority is economic stability and restoring confidence that the United Kingdom is a country that pays its way.\nFor that reason, the medium-term fiscal plan is extremely important. I want to confirm that it will demonstrate debt falling over the medium term, which is very important for people to understand. It\u2019s also extremely important that that statement is based on the most accurate possible economic forecasts and forecasts of public finances.\nFor that reason, the prime minister and I have decided that it is prudent to make that statement on the 17th of November when it will be upgraded to a full autumn statement.\nI\u2019ve discussed this last night with the governor of the Bank of England. He understands the reasons for doing that, and I\u2019ll continue to work very closely with him.\n\n\nUpdated at 11.27am BST\n\n\n 11.08am  \nFiscal update delayed for autumn statement on 17 November\n\nThe Treasury has announced that the fiscal statement, originally planned for 31 October, has now been delayed until 17 November.\n\n\nUpdated at 11.11am BST\n\n\n 11.01am  \n\nThe environment sector has reacted with some surprise that Rishi Sunak has appointed Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Coffey as environment secretary.\nAt a crucial time for the environment, with much important and complex legislation coming down the line including the farming payments review due this week, many hoped the new prime minister would choose someone with recent senior experience in the department.\n\nNames hopefully floated around as the reshuffle took place included George Eustice, the former secretary of state under Boris Johnson, and Victoria Prentis, a former minister at the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) who is popular in the farming sector. Some even dared to dream that Michael Gove, the architect of a lot of the post-Brexit environmental legislation that was under threat by Liz Truss, might make a return.\nHowever, there are some points of hope in Coffey\u2019s appointment, despite the fact she has not shown much interest in the environment in the past. Unlike her predecessor Ranil Jayawardena, she held a junior ministerial role at Defra for three years.\nRead the full story here:\n\n\nUpdated at 11.09am BST\n\n\n 10.50am  \n\nThe head of the UK\u2019s lobbying watchdog has called for tougher disclosure rules to show which ministers have been solicited, as well as a review of exemptions made use of by David Cameron and Philip Hammond.\nHarry Rich, who is in charge of the register of consultant lobbyists and their clients, said it would \u201csignificantly assist transparency\u201d if lobbyists were asked to reveal which ministers and permanent secretaries they had spoken to \u2013 as well as when, how and what about.\nHe also told the Guardian that it would \u201cdefinitely enhance transparency\u201d if contact between consultant lobbyists and special advisers was brought under the regime. \u201cThe more transparency there is, the more the aims of the legislation are being upheld,\u201d he said.\nRich is making suggestions for more transparent lobbying declarations in a submission to parliament\u2019s public administration and constitutional affairs committee (Pacac) in his first public intervention on the subject since taking the job in 2018.\nIn the submission, he suggests declarations include which minister or permanent secretary was lobbied, dates of the communications, medium of communication \u2013 whether by meeting, letter or email, phone, text \u2013 and topics of communication. \u201cThe fact that the targets of lobbying activity are not identified on the register feels like a significant gap,\u201d it says.\nRead the full story:\n\n\n\n\n 10.44am  \nLabour joins calls for investigation into Suella Braverman\n\nThe shadow home secretary, Yvette Cooper, has written to the cabinet secretary, Simon Case, to demand an investigation into Suella Braverman after she breached the ministerial code.\nBraverman was forced to resign for a security breach for emailing confidential policy to a backbench MP, John Hayes, and trying to copy in his wife but mistakenly emailing it to another MP\u2019s office. Officials raised alarm that Braverman may have been sharing sensitive information outside the department.\nCooper wrote:\n\nIf a full investigation has not yet taken place into the extent of this and other possible security breaches, I am urging you and the Home Office to now urgently undertake such an investigation as the public has a right to know that there are proper secure information procedures in place to cover the person who has been given charge of our national security.\nIt must include the extent of the Home Secretary\u2019s use of private email accounts to circulate Government papers and the extent to which official documents have been sent outside Government, as well as any other concerns that have been raised about possible serious information and security breaches by Suella Braverman.\n\nThe Lib Dems have also called for a Cabinet Office inquiry into Braverman.\n\nUpdated at 10.47am BST\n\n\n 10.38am  \n\nRishi Sunak may delay a fiscal announcement that is pencilled in for Halloween and will be designed to stop the markets going into another spiral, a senior minister has admitted.\nGiven that the new government has only just got up and running, James Cleverly, the foreign secretary, said it may no longer be possible to stick to that date for the statement, when major spending cuts and grim forecasts about the future of the economy are expected to be laid out.\nThe long-awaited statement was originally meant to be the former chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng\u2019s chance to set out his medium-term growth plan, and it was brought forward by nearly a month after borrowing costs and currency exchange markets went haywire off the back of his mini-budget.\nThough Kwarteng was sacked as Liz Truss tried to shore up her dying government, the new chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, promised he would stick to the timetable, viewed as vital to reassure the City that the exchequer could plug a fiscal black hole of about \u00a370bn.\nHowever, Cleverly suggested the date could be pushed back, saying it would not be a bad thing if the government had more time.\nAsked if the government could delay the Halloween statement, he told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme:\n\nIt may well do. The prime minister\u2019s only just stepped in. That date was set by the previous prime minister in the anticipation that she would be able to work throughout this period of time on that with the chancellor. Obviously things have changed.\n\nRead the full story here:\n\n\nUpdated at 10.40am BST\n\n\n 10.31am  \n\nLabour\u2019s shadow education secretary, Bridget Phillipson, said the reappointment of Suella Braverman as home secretary \u201ctells you everything that you need to know about this government\u201d.\nBraverman is back in the role as the result of a \u201cgrubby deal\u201d which helped Rishi Sunak \u201cget over the line\u201d and become prime minister, Phillipson told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme. She said:\n\nOne moment Rishi Sunak is telling us he will lead a government of integrity, and then another minute he\u2019s appointing someone back into the Cabinet who\u2019d been sacked only the week before for a serious breach of security and a potential breach of the ministerial code.\n\n\nUpdated at 10.36am BST\n\n\n 10.23am  \n\nMinisters educated at private schools make up nearly two-thirds of the new cabinet, led by the Winchester alumnus Rishi Sunak as prime minister, according to analysis by the Sutton Trust social mobility charity.\nSome 61% of ministers appointed by Sunak attended private schools, similar to the proportion of Liz Truss\u2019s original cabinet (68%) and Boris Johnson\u2019s first cabinet (64%) but more than twice that of Theresa May\u2019s 2016 cabinet (30%), and above that of David Cameron\u2019s 2015 cabinet (50%). Cabinets led by Labour leaders Tony Blair and Gordon Brown had around a third of ministers who were independently educated.\n\nSunak\u2019s cabinet also sees the three major government departments all led by privately-educated ministers: the Home office, the foreign office and the Treasury.Of the 31 ministers attending Sunak\u2019s new cabinet as of this morning, 45% went to Oxford or Cambridge universities. This compares with 21% of all MPs.As a prime-ministerial Oxford graduate, Sunak continues a line at Number 10 that stretches back to the start of world war two: other than Gordon Brown, every prime minister who attended university was educated at Oxford.\n\n\n\n 10.16am  \n\nMore from the foreign secretary, James Cleverly, who told Times Radio he didn\u2019t know when the fiscal statement would come. He said:\n\nThe prime minister ... will want to spend time with his chancellor working through the plans to make sure that they fit with the priorities that he has set out as prime minister. If he can do that very, very quickly, then we may well be able to get it on that date. I haven\u2019t had confirmation either way.\n\nHe once again defended the reappointment of Suella Braverman just days after being forced to resign from the same post over a serious security breach. Cleverly said:\n\nSuella made an error. She has said she has made an error, she has apologised for that. But also what I know is that she is relentlessly focused on cracking down on crime, securing our borders, making sure that the Home Office is a high functioning department. I suspect that is why the prime minister wants her back around the Cabinet table because those issues are ones that I know of very close to the heart of the people in my constituency and other people across the country.\n\n\nUpdated at 10.27am BST\n\n\n 10.11am  \n\nThe first pictures have arrived showing Rishi Sunak with members of his cabinet at their first meeting in Downing Street. \n\n\n\n\n\n 10.08am  \nLib Dems demand inquiry into Braverman\u2019s return as home secretary\n\nThe Liberal Democrats have called for a Cabinet Office inquiry into Rishi Sunak\u2019s reappointment of Suella Braverman as home secretary six days after she was sacked for a serious security breach.\nThe Lib Dem home affairs spokesperson, Alistair Carmichael, said:\n\nSuella Braverman\u2019s appointment makes a mockery of Rishi Sunak\u2019s claims to be bringing integrity to Number 10. There must be a full independent inquiry by the Cabinet Office into her appointment, including any promises Sunak made to her behind closed doors.\nIf it is confirmed that Suella Braverman repeatedly broke the ministerial code and threatened national security, she must be sacked.\nA home secretary who broke the rules is not fit for a Home Office which keeps the rules.\n\nLabour\u2019s shadow home secretary, Yvette Cooper, yesterday accused Sunak, who had promised to govern with \u201cintegrity\u201d, of \u201cputting party before country\u201d.\n\n\nUpdated at 10.24am BST\n\n\n 10.01am  \n\nMore Cabinet ministers were photographed arriving at Downing Street to attend the first meeting of Rishi Sunak\u2019s cabinet.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 9.58am  \n\nNicola Sturgeon reminded Rishi Sunak of her hopes to stage a fresh Scottish independence referendum and urged significant action on living costs during a brief inaugural phone call with the prime minister on Tuesday night.\n A Scottish government read-out of their conversation said the first minister also asked Sunak to honour his pledge for a more constructive relationship \u201cbuilt on mutual respect\u201d between the government, after a fractious relationship with his predecessor Liz Truss.\nThe statement said:\n\n The first minister also expressed the strong view that the UK government should address the pressure and pain being felt by people and businesses as a result of inflation and other economic pressures, and should not exacerbate that with a further wave of austerity.\n[Finally,] the first minister made clear her intention to honour the mandate the Scottish government received from the people of Scotland at the last election.\u201d\n\n Sturgeon, the Scottish National party leader, noted that the chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, had promised to consult with devolved administrations in advance of his emergency budget next week. \nThe continuing disarray at Westminster has led her finance secretary, John Swinney, to postpone by at least a week publication of Scotland\u2019s draft budget. Swinney expects to cut hundreds of millions of pounds in spending, due to inflation and Hunt\u2019s expected cuts.\nIn amongst a round of calls with foreign leaders on Tuesday, Sunak also called Mark Drakeford, the Labour Welsh first minister. It is something of a convention now for incoming prime ministers to speak to devolved government leaders soon after taking office, a tradition Truss ignored, to Sturgeon\u2019s irritation. \n\n\n\n 9.53am  \n\nMore from the foreign secretary James Cleverly who this morning defended Rishi Sunak\u2019s decision to reappoint Suella Braverman to the role of home secretary.\nBraverman\u2019s return to the Home Office comes just days after she was forced to resign from the same post over a serious security breach. \nCleverly told BBC Breakfast:\n\nSuella made a mistake. She has said herself that she made a mistake. She\u2019s apologised for that mistake and she stood down at the time.\n\nHe denied her return came in exchange for her endorsement of Sunak in the Tory leadership contest when Boris Johnson still threatened a comeback during the leadership race last week. \nHe added that Braverman has \u201cvery very clear ideas\u201d about border control, policing and crime, adding:\n\nShe\u2019s very passionate about that and got a very clear agenda for that. It\u2019s clear that the prime minister wanted to see that delivered.\n\n\n\n\n 9.46am  \n\u2018Not a bad thing\u2019 if fiscal statement delayed, says Cleverly\n\nThe foreign secretary James Cleverly has suggested the fiscal statement planned for 31 October could be delayed as Rishi Sunak wants to ensure it \u201cmatches his priorities\u201d.\nSpeaking on BBC Breakfast, Cleverly said:\n\nObviously the date of that fiscal statement was originally set with no expectation of a change of prime minister. We\u2019ve now had a change of prime minister.\n\nSunak is in the process of forming a government and will want some time with his chancellor Jeremy Hunt \u201cto make sure that the fiscal statement matches his priorities\u201d, he continued. He said:\n\nI don\u2019t know whether that means that date is going to slip... The prime minister and the chancellor know they need to work quickly on this but they also want to get it right, so we\u2019ll see what happens to that date.\n\n\nHe was also unable to confirm whether the government\u2019s financial statement will go ahead on Monday while speaking to Sky News. He said:\n\nWe know it needs to come soon, we know people want certainty, we know people want a clear idea of the government\u2019s plans. Whether it happens exactly on that day, I\u2019m not able to confirm.\n\n\n\n\n 9.38am  \n\nMinisters have been arriving at Downing Street to attend the first meeting of Rishi Sunak\u2019s cabinet.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated at 9.38am BST\n\n\n 9.30am  \nJeremy Hunt may delay Halloween fiscal statement\n\nRishi Sunak is considering a delay to next week\u2019s highly anticipated fiscal statement intended for 31 October, according to a report.\nThe Times has reported that the prime minister is expected to meet the chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, today to discuss his proposals to increase taxes and squeeze public spending that are due to be unveiled to MPs and markets on Monday.\nSunak is considering postponing the update until next month to allow more time to scrutinise the options, the paper writes.\nThe statement could be pushed back and turned into a full budget to set out the new government\u2019s priorities for all areas of tax and spending, it adds.\nA government source said that while Sunak was across the \u201cbroad thrust\u201d of Hunt\u2019s plans, he wanted to \u201cget under the bonnet\u201d of the options. They said:\n\nThe prime minister and chancellor will be looking at the timing of the statement in the near future.\n\n\nUpdated at 9.39am BST\n\n\n 9.16am  \nWhat the papers said after prime minister\u2019s reshuffle\n\nRishi Sunak\u2019s sudden return to the top of British politics and the unveiling of his new cabinet dominates the UK front pages on Wednesday.\nThe Guardian headlines \u201cPM\u2019s reshuffle gamble on first day in charge\u201d and leads with an image of Rishi Sunak meeting King Charles at Buckingham Palace on Tuesday.\nThe paper writes that Sunak \u201cpledged to bring \u2018integrity and accountability\u2019\u201d but \u201cgambled by restoring Suella Braverman to the Home Office less than a week after she was sacked for a security breach.\u201d\n\nRead the full story here:\n\n\n\n\n 9.14am  \nRishi Sunak to hold first cabinet meeting ahead of first PMQs\n\nGood morning. Rishi Sunak will meet with his new cabinet this morning and face his first Commons appearance as prime minister, as he begins the gruelling task of uniting his party and restoring the country\u2019s economic credibility.\nAs he entered No 10 yesterday as PM, the fifth in six years, Sunak vowed to fix the \u201cmistakes\u201d of his predecessor Liz Truss and pledged to bring \u201cintegrity and accountability\u201d into his government. His cabinet reshuffle was billed as returning experienced hands to the top jobs, but Sunak gambled by restoring Suella Braverman to the Home Office less than week after she was forced to resign for a security breach.\nSunak\u2019s new cabinet keeps Jeremy Hunt as chancellor and attempts bridge the divide with former Boris Johnson supporters by sticking with the foreign secretary, James Cleverly, and the defence secretary, Ben Wallace.\nDominic Raab, Sunak\u2019s own key ally who described Truss\u2019s economics as a suicide note, becomes his deputy prime minister and justice secretary.\n\nHowever, Sunak made several decisions that alarmed some MPs, as he reappointed Braverman as home secretary and declined to promote his former rival Penny Mordaunt. He also appointed David TC Davies as Welsh secretary despite his controversial comments on subjects including face veils, trans rights, child refugees, climate change and same-sex marriage.\nBraverman, who still harbours her own leadership ambitions, was handed the job six days after she was forced to resign for a security breach for emailing confidential policy to a backbench MP, John Hayes, and trying to copy in his wife but mistakenly emailing it to another MP\u2019s office. Officials raised alarm that Braverman may have been sharing sensitive information outside the department.\nThe return of Braverman, a Eurosceptic rightwinger, drew a shocked reaction from some MPs on the moderate wing of the party \u2013 but is widely seen as a \u201cpayback\u201d for her endorsement of Sunak when Johnson still threatened a comeback during the leadership race last week.\nHere is the agenda for the day.\n09.30am. Sunak will hold his first cabinet meeting.\n09.45am. Home affairs committee on Channel crossings, which is due to hear from David Neal, the independent chief inspector of borders and immigration.\n12pm. PMQs\n2.15pm. Treasury committee hearing on the Autumn 2022 fiscal events.\nMy name is L\u00e9onie Chao-Fong and I\u2019ll be taking you through today\u2019s developments in British politics for the next few hours. Feel free to drop me a message if you have anything to flag, you can reach me on Twitter or via email.\n\nUpdated at 9.18am BST\n"

And thank you for coming along this Euro 2022 ride with us throughout the tournament. 56 years of hurt are over for England and boy does it feel good. I\u2019ll leave you with some articles to sink your teeth into:\n\n\n\nAnd here are the final highlights:\n\n\n\n\n 5.51pm  \n\nPlayer of the Tournament and Golden Boot winner Beth Mead is among the favourites to pick up BBC\u2019s Sports Personality of the Year. I\u2019m going to guess it will be one of the Lionesses who picks up the gong this year, probably Mead or captain Leah Williamson.\n\n\n\n 5.47pm  \n\nSome more insight into the celebration last night from Lucy Bronze via freelance journalist Rich Laverty: \u201cCrazy, dancing, cake, drinks, dancing again. The last message I sent on my phone was at four o\u2019clock in the morning. It didn\u2019t make much sense. And then we all had to get up at half past eight to have a meeting and then come here. [Trafalgar Square].\u201d\n\n\n\n 5.40pm  \n\nEach England player wrote themselves into history last night but who performed the best throughout the tournament? Louise Taylor rated each player\u2019s performance in the ground-breaking event, have a read here:\n\n\n\n\n 5.34pm  \n\nThe celebrations are iconic and our very own Barry Glendenning has written about them: \u201cThis morning, England\u2019s jubilant players emerged blinking into the sunlight, with several looking commendably the worse for wear. Dark glasses were employed by many to hide the ravages of what one presumes was a raucous night of well-earned celebration, while Lucy Bronze appeared to have gone \u201cfull Flintoff\u201d and pitched up at a packed Trafalgar Square looking heartwarmingly refreshed and wearing what looked suspiciously like ski goggles.\u201d Read the full piece:\n\n\n\n\n 5.28pm  \n\nMillie Bright has been a massive part of the England team this summer, being an absolute wall in defence, and she struggled to articulate the win to her club Chelsea\u2019s website. \u201cI can\u2019t even put it into words right now,\u201d she said. \u201cA summer to remember, so proud of everyone; the team, the staff, the players, the fans have been incredible. I hope everyone is proud of what this nation has achieved, not just us winning, but the crowds we have rallied up game after game, not only for ourselves but for every team, it\u2019s been incredible.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n 5.20pm  \nFay White: I was England captain when women\u2019s football struggled for attention: how far we\u2019ve come\n\nIf you read anything today make sure it is this column by former England captain Faye White. Here\u2019s a snippet: \u201cI watched history made at Wembley on Sunday, with my two young sons beside me. I couldn\u2019t sleep that night. I just kept scrolling through social media to see all the joy and celebration, and then I watched the match all over again on TV \u2013 I didn\u2019t want to miss one moment of this magnificent occasion. I\u2019m tired, but I\u2019m sure I\u2019m not as tired as the Lionesses, who I know will have had a huge celebration \u2013 as we would have done when I was England captain between 2002 and 2012.\u201d\n\n\nUpdated at 5.42pm BST\n\n\n 5.14pm  \n\nHow have you, the fans, been reacting to this historic win? Have a read below of how England supporters are celebrating:\n\n\n\n\n 5.06pm  \n\nSo what do you once you have won a Euros? Target a World Cup of course! Winning scorer Chloe Kelly said: \u201cOne is not enough \u2013 we want more.\u201d And she added: \u201cLooking at this medal makes you so much hungrier for more. The World Cup is around the corner. I want to win trophies. As a young girl you grow up seeing people win trophies and we\u2019re here doing that.\u201d Read the full piece:\n\n\n\n\n 5.00pm  \n\nElla Toone\u2019s opener in the final yesterday was the 500th goal scored in the women\u2019s Euros. A lovely stat to add to a glittering career.\n\n\n\n\n 4.54pm  \n\nIt wasn\u2019t just England who received a celebration today, the German team also had a welcome return. Have a look at this video from goalkeeper Merle Frohms\u2019 Instagram story:\n\n\n\n\n 4.48pm  \n\nReports are coming in the Football Association are looking to extend Sarina Wiegman\u2019s deal after her historic Euros win. The manager\u2019s current deal runs until 2025 but bosses want to nail her in for a longer contract. Thoughts? \n\n\n\n\n 4.42pm  \n\nThere have been so many standout moments of this Euros but one of the sweetest has to be eight-year-old Tess dancing to Sweet Caroline. She received final tickets and even got to hold the trophy!\n\n\n\n\n 4.36pm  \n\nImpact of this Euros already taking shape:\n\n\n\n\n 4.30pm  \n\nCameron has got in touch and said: \u201cSo I see that the England women\u2019s team will soon face the ultimate test: not the United States, but a wet Tuesday night in Stoke (against Luxembourg)\u201c After winning the Euros there isn\u2019t anything they can\u2019t face!\n\n\n\n 4.26pm  \n\nBrighton are all over the signings today as they announce midfielder Yeeun Park has joined the club on a two-year deal. The WSL side have also announced Elisabeth Terland as a new signing today.\n\n\n\n 4.19pm  \n\nItching to watch England again? Well they will be back playing on home soil in September, the tickets for the game are already on sale:\n\n\n\n\n 4.12pm  \n\nJust when Manchester United fans couldn\u2019t think there could be more good news after Toone, Russo and Earps win the Euros, Lucy Staniforth has extended for the club. The star\u2019s new deal runs until the end of the upcoming season and she said: \u201cI\u2019m really grateful to be given this opportunity and want to make sure I hit the ground running this season and contribute as much as I can. I feel great in myself and I\u2019m really looking forward to the new campaign.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n 4.06pm  \n\nThis tournament has seen so many stars shine. Cascarino, Bonmati, Popp and Mead to name a few but this Euros was also one for the keepers. Van Domselaar saved around 25 shots and Thalmann, Earps, Frohms and so many other shot stoppers impressed. This is surely the save of the tournament though for Van Domselaar:\n\n\n\n\n 3.57pm  \n\nThese pictures will bring you a lot of joy on this sunny Monday:\n\n\n\n\n 3.52pm  \n\nIt\u2019s worth giving a nod to Ellen White for her tournament, maybe not as many goals scored as expected but she has closed in on Wayne Rooney\u2019s all-time England goal record. She now has 52 to her name behind Rooney\u2019s 53 and the Lionesses play again in September so she could have the record soon.\n\n\n\n\n 3.47pm  \n\nMore handball chat anyone? Christopher has emailed and said: \u201cI don\u2019t think the replays were particularly conclusive though. It didn\u2019t seem obvious from what I saw that the ball hit the arm rather than the shoulder / t-shirt area that IFAB currently use to define the offence. It was one those where VAR wouldn\u2019t have overturned either decision from the onfield ref and both decisions are defensible. So yes, we can count ourselves a bit lucky in the \u201cyou\u2019ve seen them given\u201d sort of way, but it\u2019s no great scandal IMO.\u201d\n\n\n\n 3.42pm  \n\nManchester United\u2019s Ella Toone scored the opener yesterday but she was a bit \u201cgutted\u201d, saying: \u201cI got them done and they fell out, now I\u2019m at the final with no lashes - it\u2019s a nightmare. I\u2019m actually really gutted. I\u2019m off to Ibiza tomorrow - get home, get my lashes done.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n 3.36pm  \n\nA lot of football fans may have looked at Chloe Kelly\u2019s celebration last night and thought of the US\u2019 Brandi Chastain\u2019s celebration from the 1999 World Cup. The star herself thought it too and tweeted: \u201cI see you @Chloe_Kelly98 well done. Enjoy the free rounds of pints and dinners for the rest of your life from all of England. Cheers!\u201d\nHere\u2019s Kelly\u2019s celebration:\n\nHere\u2019s Chastain\u2019s:\n\n\n\n\n 3.30pm  \n\nAmid the Euros there have been a lot of transfers in the summer window. The latest sees Elisabeth Terland, who competed for Norway this summer, move to Brighton from Brann. Check out all the rest of the moves here:\n\n\n\n\n 3.23pm  \n\nGerman chancellor Olaf Scholz was at Wembley to cheer on his national side in the final yesterday but Prime Minister Boris Johnson wasn\u2019t present.\n\u201cAsked why Johnson did not do the same, despite sporting an England top as he watched from the crowd when Gareth Southgate\u2019s side took second place in the delayed Euro 2020 tournament, his spokesperson said: \u201cThe prime minister did watch the game at home along with, I think, 17.4 million other people.\u201d\u201d\n\n\n\n\n 3.15pm  \n\nI know all you England fans reading this wanted to be in Trafalgar Square this afternoon for the celebrations. Well here\u2019s a video to make you feel as though you were there, which you were in spirit!\n\n\n\n\n 3.07pm  \n\nCaptain Leah Williamson described manager Sarina Wiegman as the \u2018secret ingredient\u2019 England have been missing and I can\u2019t help but agree. Under the boss England have conceded just five goals in 20 matches and they haven\u2019t lost a single game.\n\n\n\n\n 3.00pm  \n\nHere are some pieces you should read and listen to about that historic final last night:\n\n\n\n\nUpdated at 3.00pm BST\n\n\n 2.51pm  \n\nThe discussion of if Williamson\u2019s handball was a penalty rumbles on. Nigel has got in touch and said: \u201cIt is (only) an offence if a player touches the ball with their hand/arm when the position of their hand/arm is NOT a consequence of, or justifiable by, the player\u2019s body movement for that specific situation.\u201d It\u2019s a close one to call but I think England were a touch lucky VAR didn\u2019t get the referee to look at it.\n\n\n\n\n 2.45pm  \n\nChloe Kelly said of her winning goal: \u201cI was here on crutches that day watching Bobby Zamora score that winner and I said to my family this morning: \u2018There\u2019s going to be a Bobby Zamora moment today\u2019, and there was! Unbelievable. You \u2018Rs!\u201d\nNow Bobby Zamora has heard about it and tweeted:\n\n\n\n\n 2.40pm  \n\nThe friendship between Rachel Daly and Millie Bright is so tight and their dancing together are Trafalgar Square earlier was iconic. I know I\u2019m using the word icon a lot but it\u2019s the only work to describe this team.\n\n\n\n\n 2.35pm  \n\nOur very own Jonathan Liew was at Wembley yesterday and he wrote about the legacy the final could have. \u201cTomorrow arrived with a referee\u2019s whistle,\u201d he writes. \u201cAnd as England celebrated, the tableau that greeted us at Wembley would have been unthinkable even a few years ago. Women commentating on television. Women tapping away in the press box. Women officiating, women coaching on the touchline, women bellowing in the stands. Over the last few weeks these sights have become normalised because they are, in fact, normal. The crowds will disperse. The wall of noise will dissolve. But this legacy will remain: a nation slowly being rewired to expect different, to expect better.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n 2.30pm  \n\nJill Scott is putting 16 years of being in this England team into her celebrations and it\u2019s amazing. Have a look at this:\n\n\n\n\n 2.23pm  \n\nLucy Bronze reveals those glasses were necessary after the big celebrations last night. I can\u2019t get over how iconic she is, if she wins the World Cup with England next year she would have won everything there is to win in English football. WSL, Conti Cup, FA Cup, Champions League and the Euros already in the pocket. Alongside those French domestic titles and FIFA Best awards.\n\n\n\n\n 2.18pm  \n\nThe amount of sunglasses worn on stage is reflective of the hangovers from well deserved celebrations, have a look at this:\n\nAlso Rachel Daly was on the karaoke:\n\n\n\n\n 2.11pm  \n\nWhat a journey for Manchester City\u2019s Chloe Kelly, also how iconic is this photo:\n\n\n\n\n 2.05pm  \n\nWould you like a compilation of Beth Mead\u2019s six goals? Of course you would! I think my favourite Mead was her first against Austria. But if I had to pick a favourite England goal of the tournament I have to narrow it down to three. Stanway\u2019s against Spain, Russo\u2019s against Sweden and Toone\u2019s against Germany. What has been your favourite England strike or favourite of the tournament?\n\n\n\n\n 1.58pm  \nLionesses and manager Wiegman awarded Freedom of London\n\nThe Lionesses and manager Sarina Wiegman have been awarded the Freedom of London award and they\u2019ll pick up the honour later this year. Other people who have had the award include Florence Nightingale and Winston Churchill. Leah Williamson is also to have the Freedom of Milton Keynes.\n\n\nUpdated at 5.41pm BST\n\n\n 1.53pm  \n\nHere is the crowd in London, the players are in the mixed press zone now before heading off for some more partying:\n\n\n\n\n 1.51pm  \n\nGuardian columnist and former England star Anita Asante has said of the Lionesses\u2019 win:\n\n\n\n\n 1.47pm  \n\nGeorgia Stanway has spoken at the London celebrations and she is looking to build on what the Lionesses have started: \u201cLife\u2019s changed for the future generation. We\u2019ve definitely inspired a nation here today. We want people to jump on the bandwagon, we want people to fill them stadiums. We want people to stay with us because this is only the start.\u201d\n\n\n\n 1.43pm  \n\nOliver has emailed and he too is looking to be the Lionesses\u2019 beat mate: \u201cI\u2019m still on cloud 9 after living the best life at Wembley yesterday! As someone who similarly wants to be best friends with this England squad, any tips you receive would be greatly appreciated. Whilst you\u2019re with them, can you also ask how to get hold of one of those \u201cHome\u201d t-shirts? They\u2019re great!\u201d I think Nike could be selling the shirts, that is who has provided them for the players.\n\n\n\n 1.38pm  \n\nWe have a confirmed legend and icon in Jill Scott, the earlier reports are correct she has pulled an all nighter. She said: \u201cIt\u2019s worth it. I don\u2019t want to miss a moment and sleeping would be missing it wouldn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\n\n\n\n 1.32pm  \n\nAdrian has got in touch and said: \u201cAmong so many great moments was @Chloe_Kelly98 excellent tactical work in the top right hand corner of the field for most of the last 5 mins of extra time keeping possession at all costs.\u201d Completely agree, her game management was excellent yesterday as well as her winning goal.\n\n\n\n 1.27pm  \n\nFrom one great manager to another, Chelsea\u2019s Emma Hayes has spoken about Sarina Wiegman. \u201cShe is an amazing manager. It\u2019s the same sport, she just manages women rather than men at an extremely high level,\u201d Hayes told PA. \u201cI think some of the opinions in and around whether women could do that job are absolute nonsense. Of course she could do the job.\n\u201cI think it is time for a lot of things to be on more of an equal footing. Whether it is my niece only being able to play one football session in school, whereas the boys play three, or girls who are playing at the same level as the men on a fraction of their pay.\n\u201cFor me, there has to be an increase in investment across the game, and when it comes to coaching into the men\u2019s game it has to be a pre-requisite for successful teams. I think it is time for those changes to happen. You\u2019ve got to invest in not only free access for the kids, but also coaching, because seeing Sarina on the touchline last night I think is immense for any young girl who aspires to grow up being a coach. We need to invest in female coaches as well.\n\u201cI am super proud of Sarina. She is an an immense human being who carries the pressure so well and delivers in so many different ways. I\u2019m sure for her winning the title with her home nation was immense, but she realised last night how massive football is in this country. She is so humble, she is knowledgeable, she is wise and she is experienced, and most importantly, she is a fantastic person.\u201d \n\n\nUpdated at 1.28pm BST\n\n\n 1.21pm  \n\nThe players are leaving the stage now for what I\u2019m guessing is another day (or week) of celebrating. \n\n\n\n 1.20pm  \n\nSo here is a lovely fun fact for you. Sarina Wiegman is the first manager to lead two different nations to Euros glory. She has done so in style, not losing a single match.\n\n\n\n\n 1.17pm  \n\nHow can I become best friends with the entire England squad? Is that something that can be arranged? Also BBC 5 Live are reporting Jill Scott has pulled an all nighter, what an icon. The BBC coverage is over but Sky are still showing it, these players aren\u2019t leaving the stage any time soon.\n\n\n\n 1.13pm  \n\nWhat a mood Lucy Bronze is in Trafalgar Square:\n\n\n\n\n\n 1.06pm  \n\nThe momentum for women\u2019s football is huge, clear to see with 7,000 in Trafalgar Square to celebrate, so how does the sport capitalise on it?\n\n\n\n\n 1.00pm  \n\nThe broadcast is over but that celebration is going on into the afternoon! Alex Scott finished with a perfect sentiment, saying: \u201c#whocares, millions care. Millions. Like our captain Leah Williamson said, the tournament may be over but the journey has just begun.\u201d And I\u2019m crying again.\n\n\n\n 12.58pm  \n\nThe players and backroom staff have formed a line and are kicking their legs out. The arms are going in the air, their jumping and the whole Trafalgar Square are singing the iconic song. Lucy Bronze is loving this and Chloe Kelly is out for a solo dance. Millie Bright is on the mic signing along.\n\n\n\n 12.56pm  \n\nEvery player is now taking the opportunity to lift it, Wiegman lifts it to the biggest cheer. England fans definitely love their manager.\nWilliamson is back on the mic: \u201cDreams turn into reality. Hopefully there is a generation that is being inspired by us.\u201d Sweet Caroline is blaring on the speakers, here we go!\n\n\n\n 12.54pm  \n\nThe trophy is out on stage and the team are going to lift it in front of these supporters. Leah Williamson is doing the honours, the confetti canons go and the fans are raucous.\n\n\n\n 12.53pm  \n\nBeth Mead, Golden Boot and Player of the Tournament winner, said: \u201cI am so proud of being in this team. Sometimes football sucks, I worked hard and I feel so lucky to be part of this team. I am so happy to be here.\u201d\n\n\n\n 12.52pm  \n\nBronze, in skiing googles, tells BBC: \u201cI\u2019m feeling on top of the world, on top of Europe. Another trophy but the best one by far. There is still one more we can get our hands on next year.\nJill Scott adds: \u201cIt\u2019s been fantastic, to be part of this team. I\u2019m training with the best players in the world and it\u2019s so tough keeping up with them. I am so honoured to play any part in this team.\n\u201cEveryone who has put the shirt on, everyone who believed in women\u2019s football. We just wnated to be football, hopefully that is how it is perceived now around the world.\n\n\n\n 12.49pm  \n\nElla Toone, goalscorer in the final, said: \u201cIt took about ten minutes to go in the back of the net. It was the best feeling of the world, buzzing. I taught him [Harry Kane] that.\nChloe Kelly, the winning goalscorer, added: \u201cSo special to share this moment with an amazing bunch of girls. I\u2019m proud to wear this badge but I\u2019m even more proud to share the pitch with these players. I haven\u2019t stopped dancing, my feet just keep going.\n\n\n\n 12.47pm  \n\nWiegman tells the BBC: \u201cI\u2019m going back to my family, say hi to them. Have a little rest and then try to qualify for the World Cup.\u201d\nAnd Williamson added: \u201cThe legacy of the tournament was already made before the final. What we have done for women and young girls who can aspire to be us. England have hosted an incredible tournament and we have changed football across the country and the world.\u201d\n\n\n\n 12.46pm  \n\nWiegman adds: \u201cIt is so special. It is incredible. Everyone in the grey shirts [backroom staff] have done a really good job.\u201d\nLucy Bronze is such a mood in skiing googles.\n\n\n\n 12.45pm  \n\nWilliamson has spoken on her boss, she told the BBC: \u201cI think this is the missing ingredient England were looking for. She has brought us together. She is a special perosn, she puts us first as human beings.\n\u201cI think we have partied more than we have played football in the last 24 hours. It\u2019s incredible and to be able to share it with the people at the game and the country. I don\u2019t actually know what we have done, what have we done girls?! We were all pretty tired at full-time, we like to work hard but we like to party harder.\u201d\n\n\n\n 12.43pm  \n\nWiegman and Williamson have led the team out, they are in bucket hats with flags. I am a mess, the tears I have shed it over the last few days! \nWiegman said: \u201cI feel pretty good. Nice that you are all here. Thank you for coming. First of all they are very good football players, they are very good people. The willingness, the commitment, the resilience, The behaviour towards each other, the support has been incredible.\u201d\nBronze said of her boss: \u201cShe\u2019s got some good moves.\u201d\n\n\n\n 12.40pm  \nEngland players out at Trafalgar Square\n\n7,000 cheer and roar as the Lionesses emerge. What a moment for these players. Household names. Record breakers. Icons.\n\n\n\n 12.36pm  \n\nLucy Bronze has started a live story on Instagram, the players are preparing to come out to thousands of fans!\n\n\n\n 12.32pm  \n\nI hope you are all prepared for me to get VERY emotional as these celebrations get underway in London. A few minutes away from the players celebrating with their fans.\n\n\n\n 12.30pm  \n\nAbsolutely love this:\n\n\n\n\n 12.28pm  \n\nCoverage from Trafalgar Square begins at 12.35pm and I\u2019ll be taking you through it all. London mayor Sadiq Khan has already spoken in front of hundreds of fans: \u201cRecords have been broken. History has been made. This is a game changing moment.\u201d\n\n\n\n 12.26pm  \n\nI am crying again after reading this quote from It\u2019s Coming Home singer and comedian David Baddiel: \u201cWe talk about football, we just assume you mean men\u2019s football. Football is not default owned by men \u2013 that is something I think is only made clear very recently.\n\u201cIt\u2019s the same game, played by women or played by men. What\u2019s totally brilliant in the last few weeks is a sense that the country can get behind it in entirely the same way,. We\u2019ve won, not the women have won. We\u2019ve won.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n 12.22pm  \n\nChris has emailed about that potential handball and said: \u201cWhat sour grapes from the Germans who were lucky to have more than 9 players on the pitch at half time (Rauch + Oberdorf both committing multiple yellow card worthy fouls, mostly missed by a referee having a bad day at the office).\u201d\n\n\n\n 12.17pm  \n\nThis has absolutely cracked me up:\n\n\n\n\n 12.11pm  \n\nCan we speak about the tactical move of switching the taker of the corner yesterday. Chloe Kelly had stepped up to take the corner but Lauren Hemp came over and they switched. Hemp thundered it into the box and Kelly scored the winning goal. Masterclass.\n\n\n\n 12.06pm  \n\nOne player who I was heartbroken for yesterday was Alexandra Popp. She starred in her first Euros after injury prevented her from competing in 2013 and 2017 and she broke goal scoring records this year. She had to withdraw from the final after pulling a muscle in the warm-up, such a gutting way for her tournament to end.\n\n\n\n\n 11.59am  \n\nMary Earps, the keeper who conceded the least amount of goals in the tournament, everyone: \n\n\n\n\n 11.53am  \n\nElla Toone, who scored important goals against Spain and Germany, has said: \u201cI think a lot of people have fallen in love with women\u2019s football this summer. That\u2019s what we set out to do. So hopefully the crowds that we\u2019ve had this summer we can get into our grounds at club level and some more fans at the stadium to be on the journey with us.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n 11.47am  \n\nTony has got in touch, referencing the Frank Lampard ghost goal, and said: \u201cBecause England are always so lucky when they play Germany, right?\u201d\n\n\n\n 11.42am  \n\nSo was it a handball? From these pictures it definitely was.\n\n\n\nUpdated at 11.55am BST\n\n\n 11.35am  \n\nOur reporter Kate Connolly in Berlin has some insight into the German heartbreak: \nAs the German football team licks its wounds following its defeat at Wembley, at least some of the disappointment is being channelled into speculation as to whether the team was fairly treated, even maybe defrauded of victory. In particular there is discussion over whether the referees overlooked what is being referred to as a \u201cclear case of handball\u201d in the 25th minute of the match. Fury spills out of the tabloid Bild. Under the headline: \u2018Anger over the Scandal Referees\u2019 the paper writes, it was \u201cclear to see that the England player, Leah Williamson played the ball at shoulder height, with her hand\u201d.\nIt accuses the referee Kateryna Monzul, of failing to view it as a handball, whilst the video referees Paolo Valeri and Pol van Bockel, came to the joint conclusion that it was not a punishable move, \u201cSo they did not even check the scene!\u201d Bild declares.\nThe tabloid confronted Monzul about her decision after the match, with the question: \u201cWhat happened in the 25th minute with England\u2019s handball?\u201d Monzul, it said, \u201cshrugged her shoulders and stretched her arms out wide in an apologetic way and left. No explanation.\u201d \nThe tabloid then proceeded to confront Valeri after the end of the match in the Mixed Zone. His response, it said: \u201cNon posso dire niente, mi dispiace\u201d - or \u201cI can\u2019t say anything, I\u2019m sorry\u201d. Bild interprets this more bluntly in German as: \u201cSorry, I\u2019ve been muzzled\u201d.\nIt accuses British press of refusing to even discuss the issue.\nLater in a widely broadcast media interview, Germany\u2019s trainer Martina Voss-Tecklenburg, was also critical of the decision: \u201cAt this level in a final of the European Championships something like this should not happen,\u201d she said. \u201cI would like for there to be a discussion about this. But what I don\u2019t want is that it is overlooked.\u201d\nIn a separate commentary, Bild goes so far as to compare what it calls the \u201cfraudulent\u201d outcome, with the Wembley defeat of Germany\u2019s men to England at the 1966 World Cup.\nGermany is crying with our football women, and is annoyed about this new Wembley fraud! With this 1:2 defeat after an extension, we have been defrauded again almost 56 years after the scandal around the Wembley goal,\u201d it writes.\nSpiegel referred to the \u201ccommotion which reigned in connection with a hand ball\u201d which it said might have turned the game in Germany\u2019s favour. It quoted Voss-Tecklenburg as graciously saying that whilst Germany should have been granted a penalty kick, in her opinion, England was a worthy victor after the 120 minute match. \u201cThey played themselves into the hearts of many people,\u201d she said.\nDie Zeit said it was clear that the match \u201ccould have ended differently, had the referee, Kateryna Monsul, recognised Leah Williamson\u2019s handball in the 25th minute. According to the rulebook it should have led to a penalty kick, maybe even a red card. But neither the referee who is anyway normally rather overwhelmed, nor her video assistants wanted to admit they had seen anything. Which led to quite a discussion afterwards.\u201d\nMeanwhile, Germany is unsurprisingly already looking to next year\u2019s World Cup to get its revenge.\n\nUpdated at 11.36am BST\n\n\n 11.26am  \n\nOur very own Suzy Wrack is at Trafalgar Square for the celebrations of the Lionesses winning! The event will be live on BBC One at 12.35pm and there are a lot of people gathered already:\n\n\n\n\n 11.21am  \n\nIs there a more iconic pair than these two:\n\n\n\n\n 11.14am  \n17.4m people watched the Euro final in the UK and 17.897m in Germany\n\n17.4 million watched in the UK last night and it has now been reported 17.897 million watched in Germany. I\u2019d love to chat to someone who says no one cares about women\u2019s football ...\n\n\nUpdated at 5.40pm BST\n\n\n 11.09am  \n\nMagnus has reached out and he agrees with the German coach about the handball, he said: \u201cPopp out, wrong decision in the 25th min, should gave been a German penalty, VAR in this Euro was terrible. Lucky England, but you have to do it anyway.\u201d\n\n\n\n 11.05am  \n\nGermany manager Martina Voss-Tecklenburg says it \u201churts\u201d the referee didn\u2019t check the potential handball in the first half, she is convinced it was a penalty. \u201cFirst half, possession was better for England so they put more pressure on us, we got a few free-kicks that sometimes lacked courage, but we managed to have some attacks,\u201d she said. \u201cThere was a situation at 0-0 where there was a clear handball in the penalty area. The VAR looked but didn\u2019t award it. In such a game it\u2019s difficult to cope with that. Why didn\u2019t the referee look? That hurts a bit.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n 10.59am  \n\nTony has been in touch and suggested the Lionesses have a new celebration song: \u201cAfter the remarkable Williamson interview on the pitch after the game (well done Natalie Perks for just about holding it together, by the way) can England adopt the Who song \u201cThe Kids Are Alright\u201d?\u201d It\u2019s a great suggestion, I\u2019d love to see it.\n\n\n\n 10.55am  \n\nHave you seen anyone cooler than Rachel Daly?\n\n\n\n\n 10.50am  \n\nThe Lightning Seeds, David Baddiel and singer-songwriter-footballer Chelcee Grimes did a special concert on Saturday with former Lionesses including Anta Asante and Faye White. They performed the famous \u2018It\u2019s Coming Home\u2019 with new lyrics including England players names. Have a read of the lyrics below and a look at the performance. I really hope they release this as a separate song.\n\n\n\n\n\n 10.43am  \n\nCameron has got in touch and asked: \u201cIs there a \u2018curtain-raiser\u2019 match between the WSL champions and the Women\u2019s FA Cup winners?\u201d Chelsea won both competitions but I don\u2019t think there will be a one-off match between the Blues and another club ahead of the season start. \n\n\n\n 10.39am  \n\nThere has been a lot of discussion around how the FA\u2019s investment in the women\u2019s game has helped to produce the result last night. Sweden\u2019s goalkeeper Hedvig Lindahl agrees, tweeting \u201cshows that when you invest properly, the results come quick\u201d.\n\n\n\n\n 10.33am  \n\nIsn\u2019t captain Leah Williamson all of us right now?\n\n\n\n\n 10.28am  \n\nThank you John! Well did anyone get any sleep last night? I spent a good few hours sharing reels, stories and singing \u2018It\u2019s Coming Home\u2019, though there should be a new version with \u2018It Came Home\u2019 now. What a night and what a moment for English football. Get in touch with me via Twitter, @rendellx, or email to tell me all about your celebrations.\n\n\n\n 10.25am  \n\nSarah Rendell will be your guide from this point. I\u2019ll leave you with this video of the joyous post-match scenes on Sunday:\n\n\n\n\n 10.19am  \n\nThoughts inevitably will turn pretty quickly to the World Cup in Australia and New Zealand next year (the opening game kicks off in less than 12 months). Here\u2019s Lucy Bronze, speaking post-match on Sunday\n\nWinning a Champions League and FA Cups and stuff has always been amazing but a goal of mine has always been to win with England. And I would\u2019ve traded all those trophies previously for a night like tonight. So yeah, I\u2019m so proud of the fact we finally got our hands on a trophy but now we want to get our hands on a World Cup next year.\n\nEngland will certainly go into that tournament with momentum (though strictly speaking they haven\u2019t actually qualified yet). Usually the European champions have two years for the euphoria of victory to wear off but Wiegman\u2019s team have just one WSL season standing between them and the World Cup. And the double has been done before: Germany followed their European crowns in 2001 and 2005 with victory on the world stage in 2003 and 2007, while, more recently, the Netherlands reached the final in 2019 on the back of their 2017 European win.\n\n\n\n 9.55am  \n\nThe viewing figures for Sunday\u2019s final were pretty extraordinary:\n\nThat really does illustrate the progress made over the past decade or so \u2013 it\u2019s not that long ago that the BBC were scheduling an England Women\u2019s World Cup quarter-final on their red button service, initially preferring repeats of Porridge and Flog It! on their main channels.\n\n\n\n 9.49am  \n\nDavid Baddiel, one of the men to \n   <strike>\n     blame \n   </strike> thank for Three Lions (Football\u2019s Coming Home), said hearing the song sung at Wembley on Sunday was beautiful:\nHe told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme: \u201cIt\u2019s beautiful, it\u2019s fantastic. It was beautiful to hear it sung out at Wembley yesterday as we finally clinched a final - I really did think that would never happen.\n\u201cIt was so amazing to actually think: \u2018Oh, we won\u2019 \u2013 this doesn\u2019t happen. It\u2019s actually happened, and then the team all coming into the press conference and anarchically breaking [it] up by singing the song \u2026 it was just so brilliant, and so in the spirit of the Lionesses, which is kind of joyful and unbridled and brilliant, the way they play. So yes, I was very happy about it.\u201d\n\n\n\n 9.28am  \n\nThe FA\u2019s appointment of Sarina Wiegman really does have to go down as a masterstroke. Hope Powell\u2019s departure in 2013 after 15 years at the helm was always going to create something of a vacuum and after a couple of missteps they have finally got it right. There\u2019s an authoritative calmness about Wiegman\u2019s managerial style that complements the raw heart-on-sleeve energy of the squad and she found the right words after every match in the tournament. \n\n\n\n\n 9.11am  \n\nIt feels like there were umpteen iconic images to come out of Sunday\u2019s final. Here are just a few of them:\n\n\n\n\n 8.52am  \n\nEngland\u2019s 23-woman squad and head coach Sarina Wiegman have been awarded the Freedom of the City of London. Like failing to queue for buses and leaving your umbrella on the tube, it\u2019s one of the city\u2019s ancient traditions, going all the way back to 1237. Leah Williamson and co join such luminaries as Morgan Freeman, former England cricket captain Sir Alastair Cook, Annie Lennox, Helmut Kohl, Woodrow Wilson, Henry Winkler and Ed Sheeran in receiving the honour.\n\n\n\n 8.33am  \n\nThe Football Association\u2019s chief executive, Mark Bullingham, told the BBC on Monday morning that England\u2019s victory is a chance to \u201cturbo charge\u201d the development of the women\u2019s game:\n\n\u201cThe last few years have been incredible. We have invested really heavily and the Lionesses have taken their opportunity and they have produced something incredible. It\u2019s been an amazing month and an amazing day yesterday. I think it will really turbo charge everything we have been doing in the women\u2019s game. There is no reason why we shouldn\u2019t have the same number of girls playing as boys and it will inspire a whole new generation of players.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n 8.31am  \n\nHere\u2019s Peter Lansley on England\u2019s match-winner Chloe Kelly:\n\n\n\n\n 8.22am  \n\nHello all. And welcome to a world where an England football team are champions of Europe. \n\n\n\n\n 8.13am  \n\nBefore I sign off and hand you over to my colleague John Ashdown, and as talk turns to the future of women\u2019s football, here\u2019s a reminder, if one were needed, of the long road that has been trodden towards Sunday\u2019s seismic moment at Wembley. Bye for now.\n\n\n\n\n 8.03am  \n\n\u201cSo it wasn\u2019t a dream\u201d seems to be a recurring theme as people begin to wake up and feel the need to pinch themselves.\n\n\n\n\n 7.55am  \n\nJoin us as we delve deeper into the wonderful world of women\u2019s football through our weekly newsletter. It\u2019s informative, entertaining and global. It is also critical \u2013 when needed \u2013 and passionate. Sign up to Moving the Goalposts, the Guardian\u2019s weekly women\u2019s football newsletter, to keep reading about the game.\n\n\n\n 7.54am  \n\nLet\u2019s take a moment to savour a few snaps from a momentous night at Wembley. \n\n\n\n\n 7.41am  \n\nAmid all this English back-slapping, what of the poor Germany team? Their night was probably best summed up by an unfortunate incident even before a ball had been kicked at Wembley, when striker Alexandra Popp suffered a muscle injury in the warmup. Perhaps the writing was on the wall? \n\nAnd, as with most high-stakes football matches that must involve a winner and a loser, a sense of injustice pervades from the fallen, in this case over an incident in the 25th minute that I didn\u2019t see, honest. Marcus Hildebrandt has emailed in to remind me about it, anyway. \u201cHave a very close look at the 25th minute. Someone\u2019s hand is preventing a goal [for Germany], and it isn\u2019t the goalkeeper\u2019s!\u201d Marcus writes. \u201cNevertheless, congratulations!\u201d\nGerman tabloid Bild was less magnanimous, declaring: \u201cWe are cheated again.\u201d More reaction from Germany here:\n\n\nUpdated at 7.47am BST\n\n\n 7.28am  \n\nThe Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, has issued his congratulations to the Lionesses. \n\nI couldn\u2019t be more proud of the team today \u2013 they\u2019ve displayed extraordinary talent and determination throughout the tournament, they\u2019ve broken records, and now they\u2019ve made history. The atmosphere at Wembley and across the country throughout the tournament has been a fantastic advert for women\u2019s football. Nearly 600,000 tickets were sold for the matches and more than nine million people tuned in to watch England play. \nThe Women\u2019s Euro 22 will have inspired a new generation of women footballers and I hope this paves the way for better access to football for girls in school, more investment in grassroots girls and women\u2019s football and much more support for girls and women in all sports. \nI would like to thank Sarina Wiegman and the Lionesses for treating us to an amazing summer of football. I can\u2019t wait to see them lift the trophy again as they celebrate with the fans on Trafalgar Square on Monday.\n\n\n\n\n 7.23am  \n\nRob Collins has emailed in. \u201cHi Mike.\u201d Hi Rob. \u201cA stunning result that rewarded all those who believed. As a thank you, I would love to see the Lionesses do an open top bus parade in every town that hosted a game.\u201d Nice idea. Sheffield, Brighton, Southampton and Manchester stand by.\n\n\n\n 7.16am  \n\nOpportunity abounds and, writes Jonathan Liew, the future is bright:\n\nEngland won. In the end, perhaps that was the only thing that mattered...But of course it had to mean more than this. And as captain Leah Williamson hoisted the trophy aloft in her rainbow armband, in front of a record crowd and a television audience likely to be the highest ever for a game of women\u2019s football in Britain, it felt simultaneously like the end of one journey and the beginning of another. The first, an undying struggle for resources and respect, for parity and a platform, is finally complete. The second is a journey with no maps, no driver and no end in sight.\n\nMore here:\n\n\n\n\n 7.08am  \n\nSo how to capitalise on this incredible moment? Guardian football contributors Suzanne Wrack, Faye Carruthers, Louise Taylor, Sophie Downey and Jen Offord were asked for their thoughts. From launching a World Cup bid to a bold marketing plan, here they are:\n\n\n\n\n 7.00am  \n\nSunday\u2019s final attracted a record 87,192 fans to Wembley - the highest attendance of any European Championship final, men\u2019s or women\u2019s - to round off a record-breaking tournament in terms of in-person attendance. Interest in the women\u2019s game has never been higher and there seems to have been a shift in perception over the past couple of weeks.\nAs Carrie Dunn writes:\n\nFor the first time, plenty of this summer\u2019s coverage has been about technique and tactics, not just the players and their personal lives. Both male and female pundits have been analysing the games, and the mainstream media have been chatting about the results \u2013 which is also what\u2019s happened in workplaces around the country. It\u2019s everyday watercooler talk, the same as you\u2019d expect from any major men\u2019s tournament.\n\nRead Carrie\u2019s full article here:\n\n\n\n\n 6.47am  \n\nThe Queen said England\u2019s victory was \u201ca significant achievement\u201d, before adding that the England squad \u201cset an example that will be an inspiration for girls and women today, and for future generations\u201d.\nMeanwhile, English football royalty Sarina Wiegman stated six clear words after her side\u2019s win. \u201cMost of all, we changed society,\u201d the Dutch coach said. \u201cI think what we\u2019ve done is really incredible. I\u2019m so proud of the team. I think I need a couple of days to realise what we\u2019ve done.\u201d\nMore from Wiegman and her players here:\n\n\n\n\n 6.36am  \n\nWe can expect more scenes like this today, then.\n\nOf all the celebrations already seen though, this is quite possibly the best - the moment when the England players storm an unsuspecting Wiegman\u2019s post-match presser, singing and dancing to the tune of Baddiel and Skinner\u2019s anthemic Three Lions. Just glorious. \n\n\nUpdated at 6.50am BST\n\n\n 6.35am  \n\nPublic celebrations can continue on Monday with a daytime event scheduled at Trafalgar Square, where fans will be able to join a Q and A session with the victorious players and their manager, my colleague Gemma McSherry reports. Fans will be able to turn up and gain admission on a first-come, first served basis from 11am and the event will be broadcast on live on BBC One and BBC iPlayer from 12.40pm. \n\n\n\n\n 6.20am  \n\nEngland\u2019s \u201chistory makers\u201d obviously make both the front and back pages of this morning\u2019s UK papers, with plenty of predictable references in headlines to \u201ccoming home\u201d, \u201cyears of hurt\u201d and so on. Read them all here:\n\n\n\n\n 6.12am  \n\nWhere to start? How about with the views of the Women\u2019s Football Weekly podcast crew? Faye Carruthers, Suzanne Wrack, Ceylon Andi Hickman and Jonathan Liew got together in a Premier Inn room to digest the enormity of what they witnessed at Wembley - and what the future holds for the women\u2019s game. Take a listen here:\n\n\n\n\n 6.01am  \nPreamble\n\nIt\u2019s the sentence many thought they might never read again, but here we are: England have won a major football trophy. It\u2019s been a long 56 years since the nation\u2019s last title-winning side beat Germany in extra time at Wembley. This time around \u2013 against the same old foes, at the same north London venue and again after extra time \u2013 it was the women\u2019s team who made history and united the country in celebration.\nUnderstandably since the full-time whistle blew, reaction has been rather delirious. People danced the the Trafalgar Square fountains at full-time, there were wild celebrations in Manchester\u2019s fan zone, the players themselves gatecrashed a press conference and even the Queen got involved, offering her (slightly less unhinged) congratulations to Sarina Wiegman\u2019s team. The calls for an extra bank holiday to be granted are sure to be amplified today. \nI\u2019ll be here to take you through the early hours of the morning as the nation wakes up, a large proportion of which is quite possibly harbouring a sizeable hangover. Please do get in touch on mike.hytner@theguardian.com or on Twitter @mike_hytner, with any thoughts on the game, the newly-crowned European champions or the future of women\u2019s football.\n\n"

Hard to argue with that. Here\u2019s his report from the scene.    And you\u2019d have to say Dumfries was the man of the match. So that\u2019s it for me here. Thank you, thank you, thank you for following along here today and for the rest of the Cup. And enjoy curling season.  Updated at 8.47pm GMT    5.25pm    Alexander Cattermole is hopping mad: \u201cPulisic\u2019s set pieces created more opportunities for the Dutch than America. The insistence on using him on them should be grounds for a congressional investigation. MMA are flat track bullies who can dominate concacaf minnows but shrink when up against their supposed equals.\u201d David Konopka: \u201cPeter M has a strange memory with regards to the Bradley\u2019s. Bob last managed the US in 2011, when Michael was\u2026about 24 years old.\u201d Funny story: A US women\u2019s player whose NWSL team nearly brought in her father as an assistant insisted that such a situation was just fine because it worked for the Bradleys. Some fans would disagree.     5.23pm    Daniel Strauss: \u201cCan we finally get rid of this jumped up MLS coach and get a real national team manager, please?\u201d Richard Byrne: \u201cPhiladelphia Union coach Jim Curtin in.\u201d I\u2019ll let you two sort it out. How about Jesse Marsch?  Updated at 5.23pm GMT    5.22pm    Matt Turner says Berhalter said sometimes the game can be unfair. But he mentions that it\u2019s a result of what happened in both boxes.  \u201cWe conceded a third goal late, and that kind of took the steam out.\u201d And it wasn\u2019t their best defensive performance. \u201cWe were allowing balls into the box and not tracking runners. \u2026 It was a tough night overall defensively.\u201d Can you reflect on the positive moments, Fox\u2019s Jenny Taft asks. Not really. Not right now. The locker room is disappointed. (Well, the people in the locker room are disappointed.) And though it sounds negative, I think a lot of US fans will like that response. No reason they should be satisfied with this run. A lot of positives here, but it seems like these players aren\u2019t going to be complacent. Good for them.     5.19pm    A couple of readers take issue with Berhalter: Richard in Dallas: \u201cI\u2019m feeling bad for the USA - but this was no time to have defensive let downs..... What next for coach 3G? I feel good for LVG, though. He\u2019s a soccer weirdo, but, then, so aren\u2019t we on this MBM thread?\u201d     5.18pm    Peter Oh: \u201cI don\u2019t know the answer to your Fanta Orange question but based on what I saw in the last 90 minutes, a glass of Orange Crush has just been served up.\u201d I should point out, that even though I\u2019ve objected to some responses, that 90% of the email here has been wonderful, insightful and witty, as expected from readers of The Guardian.      5.14pm    Tyler Adams takes the softball questions: \u201cA game like that, it comes down to the margins. A team like that, you give them 3-4 chances, they\u2019re going to put them away. \u2026 We\u2019re moving in the right direction, but we need to keep pushing.\u201d \u201cWe still need to develop individually to be more mature players \u2026 a more experienced team got the better of us.\u201d Big mistake today, but the captain has shown remarkable class in this tournament.     5.12pm    Another comment from Liisa Sletzinger: \u201cFox commentators just said that the Netherlands has a date with Argentina. Actually, Argentina need to win their next match first. Sigh.\u201d In this Cup, you can\u2019t rule anything out!     5.12pm    Liisa Sletzinger was not impressed with Reyna and anyone else trying to dribble through three defenders. In fairness, the Dutch defense did a nice job clogging the passing lanes like their impressive engineering feats that keep the North Sea at bay. Dan Waters: \u201cFanta in USA is made with high fructose corn syrup. In Europe it\u2019s plain old sugar.\u201d Yes, and it\u2019s a huge difference.     5.09pm    Joshua L J Ashbee: \u201cHave to agree the Guardian sports blog has turned into a pro-USA parody of their normally fair mbm coverage.\u201d That\u2019s only because I don\u2019t speak Dutch. But I\u2019m not sure how much more credit I can give. The Netherlands finished their chances. Virgil played as expected. Noppert has wildly exceeded expectations.  Is it possible that some readers are simply anti-USA?     5.07pm    Gregg Berhalter hails the US effort. \u201cReally proud. When you think about this group, how they\u2019ve come together in the last three and a half years, you don\u2019t often get a bond like that.\u201d I don\u2019t think he\u2019ll be asked about the three big defensive lapses and lack of incisive passes that accounted for the final score.     5.06pm    Julian Menz on the last Dutch goal: \u201cAgain, it\u2019s down to naivety at the very top level. That was rank.\u201d     5.05pm    Charles Holzhauer: \u201cHey, Why don\u2019t you lay off this \u201csoccer\u201d obsession? I believe it was one of your own countrymen who observed that \u201ca rose by any other name\u2026.\u201d plus, isn\u2019t you people who put mayonnaise on your \u201cchips?\u201d Good God\u2026.\u201d I do love fish and chips. And English candy is far superior to American candy. Maybe I should stop by Pure Pasty today \u2026 But mayonnaise? Yeesh.     5.05pm    Kari Tulinius on the US goal: \u201cHaji Wright totally meant this. Either way, what a gloriously absurd goal.\u201d Absolutely. Beautiful backwards touch with the outside of the boot. Of course.     5.03pm    Peter M takes a broad view: \u201cI have thoroughly enjoyed their improvements (and undefeated record against England ;)), however, we have clear issues in our selection process. A lot of it, I believe, stems from marketability and for several years, we had a manager (Bob Bradley) who included his own son (Michael Bradley) in the selection for probably a few more years than he had been useful. The consequences of this tendency on our midfield cannot be understated. This year was definitely and improvement, but Having Gio Reyna ride pine, instead of play, is indefensible. The domestic league is improving - please - all nations, allow your washed up superstar to go so they can impart some in-game wisdom on our youth.\u201d Gareth Bale for the win.  And Yash Gupta responds: \u201cOkay so credit department - USMNT had a very good World Cup. But they remind me of a team called Tottenham which I follow. They\u2019re even wearing same kit. Shame for USMNT, this game is turning out like 2019 Champions League Final. That final was crap in quality but it felt so close at the same time. Italians can call Football whatever they want. Only moment of joy for them would\u2019ve been Germany getting out in consecutive group stages but they themselves missed both entirely. Calcio!\u201d Fair enough.     5.02pm    Mary Waltz: \u201cFirst of all, the US is not being humiliating. The Dutch might win but they will not be laughing at the end of this match and talking about how easy they had it. And the soccer controversy is so tired, played out, you are in a line of 10 million people who have been so proud of them selves for pointing out it should be called football. If you have a problem with soccer blame the people who coined the term, the brits.\u201d Matthew Schofield: \u201cTry trotting out the national team in, iirc, \u201885, on artificial turf in St Louis and going up against a T&amp;T side made up of part timers, and then losing, rather convincingly. This isn\u2019t in the top 100 embarrassing moments in the US soccer history.\u201d The US men went, off the top of my head, 11 years without winning a game in the 50s and 60s.     4.59pm    Shots: USA 17-11. Shots on target: USA 8-6. Possession: USA 58-42. Total passes: USA 564-412. You get the idea. OK, let\u2019s see what you wrote: James Robinson: \u201cI can\u2019t allow Mr Gupta\u2019s sentiments, and the extremely ungracious manner in which they were expressed, to pass unchallenged and I don\u2019t believe they are widely shared. It\u2019s good to see the USA at another finals and there\u2019s certainly no shame in losing to an excellent Netherlands team (if that\u2019s what happens).\u201d (This was obviously earlier in the game.) Richard McGahey on \u201csoccer/football\u201d: \u201cBrits used to use \u201csoccer\u201d and \u201cfootball\u201d interchangeably, research shows they started emphasizing \u201cfootball\u201d exclusively when USA started taking the sport more seriously. Also see Matt Busby\u2019s autobiography, \u201cSoccer at the Top: My Life in Football\u201d (real title).\u201d Matt Burtz adds: \u201cI wonder if the same vitriol is expressed for Australia\u2019s Socceroos, or is it merely saved for countries with populations over 330 million?\u201d Australia v Argentina later today.  Updated at 5.00pm GMT    4.55pm   Full time: Netherlands 3-1 USA  The final score is no reflection of how much terrific work the US did in this game. It is, however, a reflection of the superior professional edge the Dutch have. The US made, by my count, four mistakes in this game. The Netherlands scored three goals. You can\u2019t call that unfair. You can call it unfortunate. I\u2019m going to try to race through the mailbag before signing off.    Updated at 5.06pm GMT    4.53pm    90 +5 min: The Dutch defense is still holding, clearing every cross. They\u2019re no longer sending more than one player forward to counter. It\u2019s all defense now. And as I say that, it\u2019s 3v3 the other way.     4.52pm    90 +4 min: Cross to Morris, can\u2019t control, ends up back to Musah for a shot from 18, blocked by Virgil! Berhalter misplays the ball to Reyna. Yes, Berhalter. The coach tried to kick it back to him for a quick throw-in. That kind of day.     4.51pm    90 +3 min: Musah beats his man and crosses from the right side again. It\u2019s cleared again. Subs, with the Dutch jogging off slowly: Gakpo and Ake out. Weghorst and de Ligt in.     4.50pm    90 +2 min: Dutch subs warming up, but now it\u2019s Pulisic on the run, cut back to Musah, dangerous cross to Morris headed clear. Zimmerman and Adams stop the Dutch counter.     4.49pm    90 +2 min: Morris on for Robinson. Forward for defender. Going for broke. I\u2019m saying 4-1 final now.   Updated at 4.52pm GMT    4.48pm    90 min: Long attack for the Dutch, and the basic problem for the US is that the Netherlands can have a prolonged, dangerous attack with only three players while everyone else hangs back to surround Reyna and Pulisic. We\u2019ll play six more minutes. Surprised it\u2019s not nine.     4.47pm    89 min: US wins possession. Musah crosses, headed clear. Reyna again is surrounded as if bathing in Fanta Orange. Why is Fanta Orange so much better in Europe than in the US?     4.46pm    88 min: Reyna tries to find space. There is none. The Dutch go off to the races. The US recovers, Now, at last, the Dutch start possessing the ball.     4.45pm    87 min: Tactical foul by de Jong on Aaronson, duly punished with a yellow card. Jordan Morris is about to come in. That\u2019s not going to intimidate anyone.     4.44pm    86 min: The corner kick is nodded down and bounces slightly up, and Zimmerman tries the world\u2019s clumsiest seated bicycle kick. Why not?     4.44pm    86 min: We\u2019re getting some time-wasting now, so stoppage time will last an eon. I actually think a fourth Dutch goal is more likely than a second US goal, but I\u2019ve been wrong many, many times in this Cup. Pulisic with a wonderful ball forward to Wright, and Virgil has to be absolutely perfect to play it out for a corner.     4.42pm    85 min: Now the Dutch fans are dancing.  You could say this game has been unfortunate, that the US haven\u2019t seen a just reward for their play in this game. But they\u2019ve made mistakes, and the Dutch have punished them. Three times \u2013 all when the US was in the ascendancy.     4.40pm   GOAL! Netherlands 3-1 USA (Dumfries 81)  Oh, what a lapse. And a deserved goal for the superb Dumfries, who took advantage of Robinson\u2019s wandering toward the middle. Blind sees him, crosses over everyone in the middle of the box, and Dumfries takes it well with his left foot. No chance for Turner. That\u2019s three extraordinarily costly mistakes for the US. And three superb finishes. Yes, I\u2019m using \u201csuperb\u201d a lot. I\u2019m running out of words.   Updated at 4.43pm GMT    4.38pm    80 min: Corner kick for the US. They have not been dangerous on these, but the crowd roars. Can Pulisic get his third assist of the Cup? Nope \u2013 Noppert claims. The Dutch keeper has been superb, beaten only by a bizarre touch that looped over him.     4.37pm    78 min: CHANCE! Noppert was uncapped before this Cup, and he has saved the Netherlands several times now, this time with a sliding tackle far out of his box to take the ball from Wright, who was somehow left alone!  This has become insane. Margriet Krijgsman: \u201cWhy are you so pro USA? I am a big donor of Guardian BECAUSE they report if not neutrally at least realistically, and fair at all times. Do you secretly work for USA Today? I am sick of your evident preference for the US. I would be equally throwing up if you were so blatantly kow towing to the Dutch.\u201d No, I worked for USA Today from 1999 to 2010.  But to reiterate \u2013 the Dutch have finished clinically. The US have not. Fair play to them. And Noppert will surely earn a BIG payday after this.     4.35pm    77 min: Yedlin has replaced Dest. Might hurt the attack a bit, but ..     4.34pm   GOAL! Netherlands 2-1 USA (Wright 76)  Who needs clinical finishes? The US will take a weird looping touch off a great Pulisic cross that Wright somehow scuffs into the air and over everyone. Game on? Game on!    Updated at 4.40pm GMT    4.33pm    75 min: CHANCE on a rare blunder by the Netherlands! A backpass finds Haji Wright, who ends up one-on-one with Noppert. His touch goes wide, and his tight angle shot is cleared.     4.32pm    74 min: Reyna tries an off-balance shot and hits his head in the process. Colum Fordham: \u201cThe USA have been lively and shown sparks of good football (or soccer) \u2013 I did like Weah Junior\u2019s volley \u2013 but Netherlands have been been more clinical. As an Englishman who idolised Johan Cruyff, I admit to a certain bias in favour of the Dutch but the USA have played pretty well in this tournament. A young enthusuastic team playing decent soccer but being outplayed when it comes to football.\u201d Looks like the experienced DeAndre Yedlin will soon appear. Maybe Robinson just can\u2019t continue?     4.31pm    72 min: DOUBLE SAVE from Turner, and while the flag went up shortly afterwards, who knows what VAR would\u2019ve said. Turner parries a hard shot from Koopmeiners, then immediately scrambles to knock aside a headed follow-up from Memphis. A few seconds later, he races out to collect a dangerous ball. Hard to imagine anyone whose stock has improved more in this tournament than Turner, even if he hasn\u2019t been the busiest of keepers.   Updated at 4.34pm GMT    4.29pm    71 min: Corner kick for the Dutch, Virgil heads over. I\u2019ve been waiting to get to this one from Lennert Beurskens: \u201cIt seems like Van Gaal has (rightly) decided that we do not have the attacking nor midfield players to play the famed dominant Dutch Total Football against top teams. However, we do have some world class defenders, so the plan seems to be to play a sort of catenaccio counter attacking game. Hard to watch but so far extremely efficient. Best regards from the Netherlands.\u201d     4.28pm    70 min: The US now leads in final third entries 34-14. But the Dutch efforts just look so much better. Zimmerman has been superb. Sorry I doubted you. Robinson, who has shaken off his injury, makes a vital tackle.     4.27pm    68 min: Long stoppage there, for which the referee will surely compensate with 15 minutes after we play 90. I exaggerate. I hope. Zimmerman safely plays it out to stop the onrushing Dutch. Aaronson fouls Timber. Barely. \u201cPersistent infringement,\u201d fyi, does not necessarily mean the same player committing all the fouls, and the next player who breathes on Pulisic should be sent to Dubai.     4.25pm    65 min: SUBS, but Robinson is down, and this might hold things up. Haji Wright, the closest thing to a traditional No. 9 on this squad, is ready to go, as is Aaronson, an industrious Leeds United teammate of Adams. Will Berhalter need to replace Robinson instead? Would Berhalter gamble with three at the back? No, surely not. Robinson looks like he\u2019ll continue. So it\u2019s Wright and Aaronson in for a disconsolate Weah and McKennie, the latter of whom was injured before the Cup and hasn\u2019t been able to go 90.     4.22pm    63 min: Robinson stops Dumfries at one end, and the Dutch think it\u2019s a penalty. It\u2019s not. Both players are hurt, but we still go to the other end, where Pulisic sets up a chance for Weah that\u2019s blocked. Back the other way briefly, but then it\u2019s back to the US, where Pulisic probably should\u2019ve fallen to draw a foul but instead keeps playing and oh my goodness would this game calm down so I can catch my breath because it\u2019s still unlikely that the US will claw back two goals.  Updated at 4.23pm GMT    4.20pm    61 min: CHANCE as the Dutch break out. Robinson recovers well. There\u2019s a scramble, and Memphis ends up forcing Turner to palm it over the bar. I think it was going high. On the corner, Turner fails to collect, but that\u2019s because he was fouled. I see so much email coming in. My apologies for not getting to it.     4.18pm    60 min: Free kick is cleared easily, as all US set pieces are. Then, oh my, a BRUTAL foul on Pulisic by the substitute Koopmeiners. That\u2019s a yellow card, and it was absolutely cynical.     4.17pm    58 min: Game has gone quiet. Gupta responds: \u201cYeah yeah Soccer word has its origin. But it doesn\u2019t include neither foot nor ball, head, shoulder, chest, buttocks, crotch.\u201d Is that a reference to the Pulisic injury?  Oh, and he\u2019s just been fouled again. Kick to the shins by Virgil. Anyway, the Italians call it \u201ccalcio.\u201d Go pick on them.     4.16pm    56 min: Weah has space in the middle, but the ball is headed clear. There will be so many \u201cwhat ifs\u201d after this game.     4.13pm    53 min: CHANCE with McKennie shooting over the bar, set up brilliantly by Reyna. Also, for Yash Gupta: Going 0-3 in the 1998 World Cup, with a loss to Iran and tawdry off-field issues, is humiliating. Failing to qualify for the 2018 tournament is humiliating. This? If you think this is humiliating, I sentence you to watch the Houston Texans. Or read my book. Whichever is more painful.   Updated at 4.20pm GMT    4.11pm    52 min: Pulisic with a nice touch to create some space. His 18-yard shot is right at Noppert. Credit Gakpo, incidentally, with that save off the line for the Dutch on the Ream shot.     4.10pm    51 min: Wow. End to end. Imagine if the score was 1-1 or 2-1.  Anyway, back to Gupta: \u201cSoccer\u201d is an English word derived from \u201cassociation football\u201d back when one group of Englishmen wanted to tackle each other and another wanted to kick each other.     4.09pm    50 min: CHANCE at the other end, and it\u2019s a save by Matt Turner. Would\u2019ve been an own goal for Zimmerman, but it was a vital intervention.     4.08pm    49 min: CHANCE cleared off the line as the ball falls to Ream on a corner, and the least likely US player to score nearly does so but can\u2019t get much oomph at close range in tight space.    Updated at 4.12pm GMT    4.07pm    48 min: Ball is stuck in midfield while Louis van Gaal gestures about something. Zimmerman and Ream cope very well with a Dutch attack here:  I\u2019m going to argue with Yash Gupta: \u201cFrom what I\u2019ve understood, okay not so much, you\u2019re more likely to do MBM if USMNT is playing in a World Cup. If that\u2019s the case then it was a fun ride which unfortunately will end today with a humiliating defeat for USA. Not that I\u2019m complaining. Anyone who calls a sport which is played with every body part except \u2018arms\u2019 Soccer, and actual game which is played with throwing ball with hands Football deserves nothing more.\u201d Just wait for my curling end-by-end.     4.05pm    47 min: It\u2019s been noted that the last time the US came back to win from two goals down was in a 2015 friendly against \u2026 the Netherlands. I think some of the US players were in middle school then.      4.04pm    46 min: A long throw-in from McKennie, and Noppert has to punch clear of Zimmerman. The best set piece from the US so far in this Cup is \u2026 a throw-in. Go figure.     4.04pm    Subs \u2026 GIO REYNA IS IN! He\u2019s replacing Ferreira. The Dutch have two subs: Teun Koopmeiners replaces Davy Klaassen. Steven Bergwijn replaces Marten de Roon. The US had 63% of possession in the first half. Japan, which barely had the ball but won its group finale, laughs. We\u2019re back on.   Updated at 4.05pm GMT    4.03pm    Is this what the Dutch wanted?  Fred Decker says what several correspondents are saying right now: \u201cMy impression, fwiw, is that the Dutch are choking the life and flow out of the game and hoping that the young, energetic American squad will make mistakes as they grow more frustrated. It\u2019s not pretty, but van Gaal has been around long enough to know that getting the win is all that counts.\u201d     4.02pm    Andy Gordon: \u201cWhether \u2018a kick in the knees\u2019 is equivalent to \u2018a kick in the shins\u2019, \u2018a kick in the Pulisics\u2019 seems appropriate and \u2018a kick in the Netherlands\u2019 should cover everything.\u201d I think Denzel Dumfries is the bees\u2019 knees. I\u2019ve never understood that expression.     4.01pm    Tactics, technique Peter Rehwaldt: \u201cIt seems as if a fair number of the US passes are going to where a receiving player IS, rather than where they are heading. Sometimes it means the pass misses completely (a cross that runs behind three attackers), and other times it means the receiver has to stop and wait for it (some of the midfield passes). Either way, passes like that stop any kind of momentum and movement.\u201d Peter Oh notes Dumfries, the man with two assists for the Dutch: \u201cThis might be the best Denzel performance I\u2019ve seen on an American big screen since Fences.\u201d I\u2019m partial to the scene in The Equalizer in which Denzel beats up all the yuppies. Wow, the mail is flooding in \u2026     3.59pm    The two best players for the US in this World Cup have been Christian Pulisic and Tyler Adams, and Sergi\u00f1o Dest has a claim to be the third best. All three have had crucial mistakes today. I don\u2019t really blame Pulisic for failing to put away that chance. But his corner kick service was terrible, and he\u2019s had a couple of wayward passes. Adams simply lost Memphis on the first Dutch goal. And Dest lost Blind. And the US is \u2026 well, not lost, but this is a mountain to climb.      3.52pm    In the past, the US would\u2019ve come out timidly for a game like this.  What we\u2019ve seen in this Cup is a team attacking like demons and pinning back their opponents. They\u2019re not just doing it to some Concacaf also-ran or Iran. They\u2019ve done it to England and now the Netherlands. That\u2019s undoubtedly a sign of progress. If only there could be some combination of this possession panache and either a Tab Ramos in midfield or a Brian McBride up front. Mailbag after refreshment \u2026      3.49pm   Halftime: Netherlands 2-0 USA  What a misleading scoreline that is. But the Dutch finished their two chances, neither of which Matt Turner could\u2019ve stopped, and the US chances just weren\u2019t quite good enough, both well saved by Noppert. Coming up, my take on US progress \u2026   Updated at 3.54pm GMT    3.48pm   GOAL! Netherlands 2-0 USA (Blind 45+1)  We only have one minute of stoppage time, and it\u2019s too long for the US. Dumfries works on the right, barely has space to get in a cross, but Blind races onto it and slams it home. Dest, for all his great work at the other end, just lost him.    Updated at 3.50pm GMT    3.47pm    45 min: Breathtaking end-to-end action! Dest drives into the box on a solo run and just has it poked away. Gakpo races the other way and outruns Ream, but Robinson tracks back well.     3.46pm    44 min: Fifa\u2019s stats say the US has outcrossed the Netherlands 16-5 but only completed 2 to the Netherlands\u2019 1,     3.45pm    43 min: CHANCE! Weah absolutely blasts it from 22 yards out and stings Noppert\u2019s hands as the big Dutch keeper reacts well.  The replay shows how perfect his technique on that bouncing ball really was.     3.44pm    42 min: Now I\u2019m wondering if Pulisic is feeling the effects of his injury. Another good combination, and Ferreira contributes well this time, and it breaks down when Pulisic\u2019s pass to the left wing is far off target. Weah in particular is starting to look industrious. The son of one of the greatest players to never play in a World Cup is a good player, and \u2026.     3.42pm    40 min: So whom would you like to see come on for the US at halftime? Reyna for incisive passes? Haji Wright for a pure striker? Brenden Aaronson just because? Pulisic gets felled by Timber. Referee sternly warns him that he can only do that 18 more times.     3.39pm    38 min: Very nice combination work down the left. The US can\u2019t get a shot out of it, but if they\u2019re able to do that 40 more times in this game, it\u2019ll surely work once. Then it\u2019s another bad touch from Ferreira.      3.38pm    37 min: Surprising news from Matt Schofield: \u201cSo i was settling in to watch the game, here in my home in Berlin, when I realized they are not broadcasting it. There have actually been quite a few games this year that have not been shown, which is shocking compared to everything through 2018. Anyway, long way of saying thanks for the minute by minute. You are my only hope (guess the movie reference?).\u201d Jedi Robinson surely appreciates.     3.38pm    35 min: Robinson finds Ferreira, who has a chance to pass it to McKennie or Pulisic but does neither.  Gio Reyna isn\u2019t a striker, either, but would he help unlock this Dutch three- or four- or five-man defense? Berhalter has not been making good adjustments at halftime. The US has outplayed all three opponents in the first half by a wide margin. The second halves \u2026 well \u2026     3.36pm    34 min: McKennie hustles to keep the ball in play on the Dutch end line.  Sergei Nirenburg: \u201cNice to see the US show enthusiasm and technique.But so far it\u2019s boys against men, methinks.\u201d I don\u2019t have the stats in front of me to quantify it, but this a very young US team. Bodes well for 2026, perhaps.  Richard McGahey: \u201cDutch playing 5 man back line when we attack, dropping wingbacks back outside tight three central defenders, slows us way down and hard to penetrate\u201d Yeah, the difference between a 3-5-2 and a 5-3-2 is more one of attitude or a game situation than anything else.      3.34pm    33 min: Now no one\u2019s in the attacking third. I like this comment from Walter Haugen: \u201cGreetings - I live in France now but I am from the US and used to coach and referee youth soccer in the 1990s. I used to make a distinction with my players about the difference between a forward and a striker. A forward shoots on goal. A striker finishes. This is appropos of your comment that the US has the combination but cannot get the final pick in. Or get the final number. Whatever.\u201d The lack of a No. 9 has been an issue here, especially with Ricardo Pepi left off the roster and Jesus Ferreira not playing until today, where he doesn\u2019t seem to be shaking off the rust. Josh Sargent, unavailable today due to injury, did OK in that role.  But what wouldn\u2019t the US give for a Brian McBride right now?     3.32pm    29 min: Corner hits a gaggle of heads, and it\u2019s judged to have gone off a US head last.  Zimmerman cleanly wins the header on the next one, and the Dutch manage only a wild pass attempt to keep it there. Pressure off for now. USA lead 15-5 in final third entries, the stats say. Replay of the goal shows Adams is the one who didn\u2019t catch Memphis, but should someone else have been there? Hard to say.      3.29pm    28 min: Steady as she goes. Ruth Purdue on tactics: \u201cLooks like the Dutch are man marking in central areas when out of possession. Following their players a lot in there.\u201d Joe Pearson: \u201cThe midfield does not react fast enough when we lose possession.\u201d Perhaps so. Maybe the US is too reliant on Adams?  Zimmerman pokes a ball away for a corner.     3.28pm    26 min: So often, a goal livens up a game. This one seems to have stopped it dead in its tracks. The US is comfortably knocking the ball around in midfield but can\u2019t find a way through. Are the Dutch \u2026 bunkering? Adam K has a tactical observation: \u201cFascinating and engaging game so far. One thing I\u2019m liking (and one thing that the USA don\u2019t seem to have caught on to yet) is that de Jong is dropping into the back line to form a back 4, kind of like he and van de Beek would do at Ajax. It feels like that\u2019s really throwing the USA midfield and allowing de Jong to dictate from deep -- but the USA are looking bright and speedy up front, specifically down the wings, and that\u2019s causing problems for a slightly aged Dutch back line. It\u2019s tantalisingly poised! Enjoy the match and cheers for doing the MBM.\u201d   Updated at 3.31pm GMT    3.25pm    24 min: More combinations here from the US, but they keep forgetting the last number to pick the lock. Or something like that. Someone asked whether \u201ca kick in the knees\u201d is a US idiom, but I said that instead of \u201ckick in the shins\u201d because players wear shin guards. Often very small one. Why do they do that? Our officials today are Brazilian. The man in the middle is Wilton Sampaio.     3.23pm    21 min: Memphis rushes a shot from a bad angle. Gregg Berhalter is chatting with the fourth official about an offside call that the commentary team believes was a mistake because a defender played it. As a referee myself, I .. was looking at my keyboard. But I will say Pulisic was just fouled, even if our referee disagrees. I\u2019ll check in on referee discussions as I have time. Which I don\u2019t.     3.22pm    20 min: Richard McGahey quibbles with my take that we\u2019re being cynical here, insisting that you can\u2019t give the Dutch an inch or give Memphis an uncontested shot there. And yeah, he\u2019s not wrong. I wouldn\u2019t say the press as a whole has had no effect, though. In fact, I think the danger in pressing forward all the time is that players may sometimes forget to track everyone on the way back, and Tyler Adams can\u2019t be everywhere. As I type, US pressure forces Noppert to play too quickly for his tastes, and the US claims the ball in midfield.     3.19pm    17 min: Robinson makes a run into the box, but there\u2019s just no passing lane. I think it might be a tad harsh on Pulisic to call his shot a \u201cmiss.\u201d I recall people saying that after the great German keeper Oliver Kahn made an terrific save on Landon Donovan in 2002. Pulisic had little time to shoot, and Noppert made a terrific save.      3.18pm    16 min: US still possessing. The Dutch players look like they\u2019ve figured things out and might be able to get through on the counter. Mary Waltz: \u201cPulisic should talk to Lukaku. You can\u2019t miss when you get a chance. Pulisic missed, Memphis didn\u2019t. Sad fact for my eagles. The US has never won a WC match when giving up the first goal.\u201d     3.16pm    14 min: Tyler Adams takes a forearm to the face from Dumfries and checks his teeth. Look, you can set up a goal, but leave Adams alone, \u2018k?     3.15pm    13 min: Pulisic again has a chance to cross, but the Dutch players outnumber the US players this time, and the ball goes back the other way. Richard McGahey: \u201cSome US player trailing Depay didn\u2019t rush to catch up with him so much for the press and intensity.\u201d Man, we are cynical in this country these days.     3.13pm   GOAL! Netherlands 1-0 USA (Depay 10)  With good teams, sometimes, you just need one chance. Good passes through midfield. The first touch from Dumfries on the right is played back to Memphis, to use his preferred name, at the top of the box, and he rips it into the net. A thing of beauty for the neutral. A kick in the knees for the US.    Updated at 3.16pm GMT    3.11pm    9 min: Finally, the Dutch get into the attacking third, but the possession is brief.  Now de Jong is racing back and forth with the ball in his own box because Ferreira isn\u2019t letting him play it out easily.     3.10pm    8 min: Well, that\u2019s better from Pulisic. He races down the left and puts in a dangerous cross for Weah that\u2019s headed clear. Then the magnificent Tyler Adams quickly wins the ball as the Netherlands try to get into the attacking third with purpose for the first time in the match.     3.09pm    7 min: Robinson races up the left side and forces a tackle out for a corner. Such a pest, this Jedi.  Pulisic\u2019s corner kick sails over the box like a plane flying over Arthur Ashe Stadium. Two big touches from Pulisic so far that haven\u2019t been the best, to be honest.     3.07pm    6 min: Still the US pressing. Weah gets the ball in the box but can\u2019t turn and has to play it back out.  Put a pin in this. I have something profound to say at halftime. Well, hopefully profound. It\u2019ll be a broad comment on US soccer history.     3.06pm    4 min: Virgil van Dijk casually shields the ball out of play. Dest practically climbs around him in an effort to get it. Didn\u2019t keep it in play, but the message is clear here \u2013 NOTHING will be easily given to the Netherlands today.      3.04pm    3 min: CHANCE! Dest\u2019s cross is headed away, but the ball comes back to Pulisic in the middle of the box, and Noppert has to use all of his long legs to keep it out.   Updated at 3.10pm GMT    3.03pm    2 min: Noppert\u2019s touch 90 seconds ago was the last substantial touch by a Dutch player. US knocking the ball around.     3.02pm    1 min: Noppert seems a little casual playing the ball while US players buzz around him. The press is on.     3.01pm    Email right now has two major themes: More talk of music to play after the game, depending on results, and those of us who remember when we were all called rude things for playing or watching soccer.  Brian McBride changed the image of soccer by bleeding. A lot. In 2006, after an elbow in the Italy game busted open his face. That made people realize this \u2026 \u2026 we\u2019ll pick this up later. Kickoff.     2.59pm    Twitter The one-time great hope of the nation is still a great supporter \u2026  Many scenes like this \u2026  Christian Pulisic actually looked kind of relaxed while singing the anthem. They looked pumped up to play. Would you expect less?     2.55pm    Predictions Before the Cup, I posited that the US men had a terrifying attack but a defense that terrified its own fans. So \u2026 I was kinda wrong. The US has scored only twice, with both goals involving Pulisic. But the defense has conceded only once, a penalty kick after a rash tackle by Zimmerman.  Then I said Iran would probably get a draw with the US. But, I figured, if the US scored in the first half, they\u2019d force Iran to come out of its bunker and many goals would be scored. In other words, I\u2019m the wrong person to ask. The Fox commentators are all-in on the US. Landon Donovan says it goes to PKs (I\u2019m sorry \u2013 are we allowed to say \u201cPK\u201d without being compared with Ted Lasso?), while Clint Dempsey sees a US win outright, and Alexi Lalas shouts \u201c2-0\u201d and practically stage-dives, Fishbone-style, into the pit of US fans behind the set.     2.51pm    Back to music for our DJ friend \u2026 Joe Pearson suggests Neil Diamond\u2019s America and inquires about my substitute teaching gig this week. I missed a lot of soccer but very much enjoyed it, thanks. Kari Tulinius says to go with Prince. Fox, meanwhile, is playing Miley Cyrus\u2019 Party in the USA. Also in the mailbag, Jim Brockton is pretending he hasn\u2019t heard of the college that UNC beat in last year\u2019s Final Four but has won five national men\u2019s basketball championships, the first in my senior year. (Yes, I\u2019m old.)     2.48pm    More mailbag \u2026 I have corrected the text lineup below that mentioned Pulisic twice. Apologies to Tim Weah. Fellow curler Alan MacNeill would like Fox to back up just a bit: \u201cI realize soccer is a metaphor for war, and has even caused international conflict....but can we get fox to dial down the patriotic rhetoric down to a 6-7 vs the 13 we are at right now? It\u2019s only the round of 16...I\u2019m half expecting if we made the semis or finals a dance line of rifle wielding cheerleaders shooting random things.\u201d Proof that we\u2019re still, at heart, a \u201cNFL and the US Army\u201d country.     2.45pm    How big is the sport now in the US? Dave Hanratty: \u201cGreetings from Ireland \u2013 I\u2019ve always enjoyed cheering on USA in World Cups, likely because of USA \u201894 being the first proper World Cup I experienced and Ireland\u2019s exciting run in it. That, and I do get a kick out of ostentatious American football/soccer commentary and so on. I was wondering if you could shed some light on just how respected the beautiful game is or isn\u2019t in the US in 2022? For a long time it seemed like it was dismissed as a \u2018girl\u2019s game\u2019 or some other sexist nonsense, but there seems to be, year on year, a notable uptick in football being taken more seriously over there? Same time, it\u2019s never ever going to eclipse baseball, basketball, or American football, right? Just looking to take the overall temperature, really. Best of luck today!\u201d I\u2019m a substitute teacher in local schools because I\u2019m a freelance journalist and therefore someone who needs side hustles (and because I enjoy it). I\u2019ve been amazed this year to see how much excitement there is. I walked by a classroom and heard USA-Iran emanating from their big screen. Kids are walking around in Pulisic shirts.  At the very least, the hostility toward soccer is dying out. But I literally wrote the book on why the US has a low ceiling in this sport. No gratuitous plug here (Google the book if you like). But to sum up: We have a great fan base, and we always manage to get in our own way with things like lawsuits. Story on one of those coming up soon, maybe in a week or two. But forget the pessimism for now. There has never been a better time to be a soccer fan here. We used to be underground. Now we rule.     2.41pm    Douglas Gibson guesses wrong: \u201cGreetings from a UNC alum! You went to NC State, I take it? Anyway, thanks to you and the rest at the Guardian team for great safe-for-work World Cup coverage. I wouldn\u2019t go anywhere else.\u201d No, I went to UNC\u2019s biggest rival in UNC\u2019s biggest sport other than women\u2019s soccer. (And occasionally victorious over UNC in that sport, too. Apologies to my fellow National Soccer Hall of Fame veterans committee member Anson Dorrance.)     2.38pm    Lineup talk \u2026 First, a simple text version by request: USA Goalkeeper: Matt Turner Defenders: Antonee Robinson, Tim Ream, Walker Zimmerman, Sergi\u00f1o Dest Midfield: Tyler Adams, Weston McKennie, Yunus Musah Forward: Christian Pulisic, Jesus Ferreira, Tim Weah Netherlands Goalkeeper: Andries Hoppert Defenders: Jurrien Timber, Virgil van Dijk, Nathan Ake Midfield: Daley Blind, Frenkie de Jong, Marten de Roon, Denzel Dumfries, Davy Klassen Forward: Memphis Dupay, Cody Gakpo The graphic is a little odd anyway, says Nick White: \u201cRegarding the US Lineup tweet...Do they always blow up player\u2019s heads like that and I haven\u2019t ever realized, or is that photoshop job of Dest uniquely terrible. His head is frightfully out of proportion with his body.\u201d Now a question from Rahul Vanamali: \u201cSurely there\u2019s something going on behind the scenes between Berhalter and Reyna - can\u2019t imagine why a player of Reyna\u2019s skill has seen such limited game time with no obvious injury concerns, unless I missed something...Does anyone have anything?\u201d Berhalter has been treading a line between brilliance and consternation. Bringing back Tim Ream was clearly a stroke of genius. The substitutions have been \u2026 odd. Surely the US would\u2019ve been better off with Reyna holding the ball at the end of the Iran game instead of Haji Wright.  Updated at 2.52pm GMT    2.31pm    I\u2019m also a fan of the music YouTuber Todd in the Shadows, who contributes this:   Yeah, but Arby\u2019s got rid of their potato cakes, so \u2026     2.30pm    David Walls disagrees with my assessment of the US national anthem: \u201cIt might not be quite up there with the Marseillaise (the obvious winner in the World Cup of Anthems) but I think the Star Spangled Banner is a contender to make the last eight at least (especially in the absence of Russia and Italy this time). It would even be in with a chance for the semi-finals if they could get Enrico Pallazzo to perform it.\u201d That may indeed be my favorite rendition of the anthem.  Colin Young needs musical advice: \u201cHi Beau, like many others I suspect, I\u2019m finding it hard to call this one. So instead I\u2019m taking requests. I was born stateside but have lived most of my life in the UK.. Even so, nothing brings out the Stars n Stripes in me more than a USMNT game. I\u2019m dj\u2019ing this evening in Brixton.. Should they prevail, what tune shall I play to celebrate? And what if they lose...? And no, it won\u2019t be \u2018Born In The USA\u2019. Any ideas out there? :)\u201d You\u2019ve come to the right place, Colin. I could talk music all day. It might clear the dance floor, but may I suggest a bit of Ray Charles either way?      2.22pm    First question for me from the inbox is \u2026 who are you? Well, not quite phrased like that. From Steve Wiles: \u201cI\u2019m not as up to date with the MBM as I used to be, so maybe you\u2019ve been around a while. Don\u2019t recognize the name though. Just wanted to say: \u2018This should be fun. Let\u2019s talk for a bit and then watch, shall we?\u2019 I like your style!\u201d Why, thanks, though I\u2019m sorry you weren\u2019t with me when I was up until all hours live-blogging the US Open this summer. I have an eclectic resume of MBM or lap-by-lap or game-by-game or skateboarding run-by-skateboarding run commentary. Fun story: When I was at USA Today in the 2000s, I did our online Olympic sports and soccer coverage, and I blatantly ripped off The Guardian\u2019s MBM style. And now they let me do it here. The other quick note: I am the co-coordinator of the Saturday Morning Breakfast Extravaganza at Potomac Curling Club. I have had to hand over the ice to our other volunteers today. Yes, I\u2019m missing curling to do this. (In the Canadian games, I did work in a lot of curling references.) This is a Very Big Deal. And please email my editors to get them to let me do end-by-end curling commentary sometime.      2.12pm    I wasn\u2019t kidding about Biden \u2026  In a more traditional setting, the Fox studio crew this morning includes their stalwart host Rob Stone, the \u201cnice guy in real life but provocateur on TV\u201d Alexi Lalas, the drawling Clint Dempsey, and an unusually animated Landon Donovan. Yes, unusually animated Landon Donovan, the guy who generally radiates California cool unless he has just scored an immense goal.  And now, Weston McKennie is in a movie trailer. That\u2019s a jarring transition.     2.07pm    One hour to go \u2026 Samuel L. Jackson just did the intro on Fox. I\u2019ve got chills, even though I would\u2019ve loved for him to say, \u201cWHAT DOES WESTON MCKENNIE LOOK LIKE?!\u201d Or Tarantino\u2019s tweaking of a verse from Ezekiel. And \u2026 whoa \u2026 Joe Biden?  This is starting to seem like a big deal.  Send in your emails while ye may, and I\u2019ll respond to as many as my typing speed and attention span will allow.     2.03pm   Netherlands lineup  The imposing Noppert is in goal, with van Dijk in the middle of the back line between Manchester City\u2019s Nathan Ake and young Ajax back Jurrien Timber. Daley Blind, who had a long spell with Manchester United but whose surname is synonymous with Ajax, is on the left, Denzel Dumfries, who moved last year from PSV to Inter, is on the right. Martin de Roon (Atalanta \u2013 the Italian club, not a misspelling of Atlanta United) and Davy Klassen (Ajax) will do their best to help de Jong control the midfield against the USA\u2019s outstanding MMA trio. (To be clear \u2013 \u201cMMA\u201d refers to their initials, not their style of play.) Gakpo and Memphis Dupay, a former Manchester United afterthought who scorched the nets for Lyon and has moved to Barcelona, play up front. Here\u2019s a nifty tactical look.      1.55pm   US lineup  And there\u2019s big news: Jesus Ferreira, the young goal-poacher who plays for FC Dallas (at the moment \u2013 he\u2019s destined to join Weston McKennie, Kellyn Acosta, Shaq Moore and other players in the USMNT talent pool as graduates of The Best Academy in the States who have gone to good clubs overseas), has been controversially omitted so far. Not today. He\u2019s starting in place of Josh Sargent, who was banged up against Iran. Walker Zimmerman returns to the back line despite Cameron Carter-Vickers doing quite well in that space against Iran. The rest is unchanged. Tim Ream, the Fulham veteran who had been out of the picture for quite a while but has served honorably alongside Zimmerman or CCV at center back, is still there, as is the MMA midfield of Adams, McKennie and Yunus Musah. The marauding outside backs of Antonee Robinson and Dest keep their spots as expected. Tim Weah, scorer of the goal against Wales and the man who had a goal called back against Iran in a razor-thin offside decision, remains on the front line. And yes, Christian Pulisic starts.   Updated at 2.39pm GMT    1.46pm    The many ties between these footballing nations \u2026 As mentioned, Dest grew up in the Netherlands and was part of the Ajax youth machine.  Also growing up in the Netherlands: Earnie Stewart, the US Soccer sporting director who scored some of the most important goals in US history, including the winner against Colombia in 1994. Also spending part of his career in the Netherlands: Gregg Berhalter, the US Soccer coach who went to some little state college* before moving to the Netherlands.  All this, plus an injury update on Christian Pulisic, in our preview by our US guy in Doha, Bryan Armen Graham:   (* \u2013 the University of North Carolina is a fine institution. I attended their greatest rival.)     1.39pm    In the Netherlands\u2019 favor \u2026 Well, they\u2019re the Netherlands, right? But are they a classic Dutch team? As \u201cthe guy who knows soccer\u201d in many a social setting, I\u2019m often asked to give ad hoc scouting reports of US opponents. \u201cOh, the Netherlands are great,\u201d I said. \u201cThey have great players like \u2026\u201d Um \u2026 OK, OK \u2013 Virgil van Dijk, yes. He\u2019s the bedrock of many a recent Liverpool success. Barcelona\u2019s Frenkie de Jong is great, even if Barcelona isn\u2019t really Barcelona these days. (Sergi\u00f1o Dest, incidentally, is a Barcelona player on loan to AC Milan, and he grew up in the Netherlands at Ajax, which rivals Barcelona in the race to be The Most Lauded Youth Academy on Earth.) Their goalkeeper, Andries Noppert, is \u2026 tall.  And Cody Gakpo is still relatively unknown because PSV Eindhoven isn\u2019t a glamour team these days, but that\u2019s going to change when a big club or three. comes calling after this Cup. With that, I\u2019ve ripped off most of Tom Dart\u2019s scouting report, but please do read the rest:  Oh \u2013 and they\u2019re not dull, insists Louis van Gaal.    Updated at 1.40pm GMT    1.29pm    In the USA\u2019s favor \u2026 Eric Wynalda, whose long history with the US team includes a goal in the 1994 World Cup, says this US team has a great goalkeeper in Matt Turner, a much-scrutinized player delivering the goods in Christian Pulisic, a solid defense, and a captain who inspires on and off the field in Tyler Adams.  And please do read more about Tyler Adams. His midfield tenacity is crucial, giving the US outside backs the freedom to attack, something that paid off against Iran when Sergi\u00f1o Dest put in the cross for Pulisic. And his composure in a press conference when asked a delicate question on race relations should be the envy of any world leader.   Updated at 1.40pm GMT    1.08pm   Preamble  Welcome to The Biggest US Men\u2019s Game Since the Last One \u2026 It\u2019s typical of a World Cup, of course, for each game to be \u201cbigger\u201d than the last, and we knew that about the US when we saw the draw.  Wales? OK, fine, typical group-stage game.  England? Now we\u2019re talking. The Land Where the Game Began has a losing record against the US in the World Cup. (And still does.) Iran? Uh oh. Flashbacks to 1998 and The Biggest Humiliation the US Ever Had in a World Cup. And a game that would surely determine whether they would advance. So this game, against \u2026 (checks notes) \u2026 the Netherlands is \u201cbigger\u201d in the sense that it\u2019s a round of 16 game. But it feels different, doesn\u2019t it? The concern that the US would embarrass itself has disappeared. Now, they\u2019re playing with house money. Is that the right term? I don\u2019t know gambling.  So it\u2019s a different type of nerves. Being the underdog is fun.  And this is winnable, isn\u2019t it? The oddsmakers generally give the Netherlands a 50% chance of winning outright, and then \u201cdraw\u201d and \u201cUS win\u201d split the other 50%. This being a knockout-stage game, \u201cdraw\u201d means \u201cpenalties,\u201d and which team will be feeling the pressure then? This should be fun. Let\u2019s talk for a bit and then watch, shall we?     1.00pm    Beau will be here shortly, but in the meantime here\u2019s how the two teams\u2019 campaigns have gone so far. How USA got here  In the opener, the US came storming out the gates and looked like they would carve up Wales for a convincing victory after Tim Weah\u2019s goal. But the Americans faded badly in the second period and the game ended in a 1-1 draw. USA then faced England, and maintained their unbeaten record against the Three Lions at the World Cup. The Americans were the better team but could not convert their chances in a 0-0 draw. The US needed to beat Iran in their final group game, and did so thanks to Christian Pulisic\u2019s effort, in which he definitely did not injure his unmentionables. The 1-0 victory sent the Americans through as Group B runners-up  How Netherlands got here  The Dutch left it late in their opening game, with their first goal coming in the 84th minute of their 2-0 victory. They also relied on a good performance from their keeper, Andries Noppert.  Cody Gakpo scored an early goal but the Dutch were put under pressure for large parts of the game in their 1-1 draw with Ecuador.  Gakpo was dangerous again as Netherlands coasted to a 2-0 win over the already eliminated hosts in their victory against Qatar. The win meant they progressed as group winners, even as manager Louis van Gaal bristled at suggestions watching his team is like \u201cgrinding teeth\u201d.    "

                    "body": "The Seattle Sounders defeated Mexico\u2019s Pumas UNAM 5-2 on aggregate to win the Concacaf Champions League on Wednesday, ending Major League Soccer\u2019s long wait to lift the top club tournament for teams from North America, Central America and the Caribbean. Two goals from Peruvian international Raul Ruidiaz and a late strike from Uruguayan veteran Nicolas Lodeiro sealed a deserved 3-0 second leg victory in front of a tournament record crowd of 68,741 at Seattle\u2019s Lumen Field. Last week\u2019s first leg had ended in a 2-2 draw in Mexico City. The Sounders\u2019 victory ends 16 years of unbroken dominance by Mexican sides in the regional club tournament. No MLS club had been crowned champions of Concacaf since Los Angeles Galaxy lifted the title in 2000. Ruidiaz struck in the 45th and 80th minutes before Lodeiro lashed in a rebound in the 88th minute to spark wild celebrations amongst Seattle\u2019s passionate supporters. The title means Seattle will also become the first MLS side to advance to Fifa\u2019s Club World Cup tournament. A cagey opening 45 minutes saw Seattle forced to reorganize their defense and midfield after early injuries to left back Nouhou Tolo and midfield playmaker Joao Paulo. Tolo limped out of the fray after an ugly challenge from Pumas right back Jose Galindo, who earned a yellow card for a wild kick on the Cameroon international\u2019s thigh. Joao Paulo exited after 25 minutes following a clumsy challenge from Leonel Lopez, forcing Seattle coach Brian Schmetzer to bring on 16-year-old teenager Obed Vargas as a substitute. Until that moment, neither side had created much in the way of scoring changes, with Ruidiaz failing to trouble Pumas goalkeeper Alfredo Talavera with a 15th-minute header and a curling shot four minutes later. As the half wore on Pumas gradually gained a foothold and created the better chances. Washington Corozo squandered a golden opportunity in the 32nd minute after a floated through ball from Favio Alvarez caught the Seattle defense napping. With just goalkeeper Stefan Frei to beat, Corozo rushed an attempted lob and blazed over the bar with his first touch. But on the stroke of half-time Seattle broke the deadlock. A jinking run from Albert Rusnak carried the Slovakia international into the Pumas penalty area and his firmly hit low cross was met by Xavier Arreaga, who laid off for Ruidiaz. The Peruvian\u2019s shot took a wicked deflection off Diogo De Oliveira and Talavera could only watch helplessly as the ball rolled into the net. Seattle soaked up pressure in the second half as Pumas chased an equalizer, and only a fantastic reflex save from Sounders keeper Frei denied an equalizer from De Oliveira\u2019s thumping header. But as Pumas pressed forward, Seattle carved out openings on the counter-attack and 10 minutes from time Ruidiaz grabbed his second. Jordan Morris burst down the right flank and passed to Lodeiro who laid off for the Peruvian, who drilled his finish past Talavera. Lodeiro then put the seal on the victory in the 88th minute, thumping home a finish after Morris\u2019s shot rebounded off the woodwork."

                    "body": "It will irk Steve Clarke that Scotland were seconds from securing a seventh straight victory. Kieran Tierney\u2019s second-half header looked like continuing momentum for Clarke before the kind of moment which would have triggered huge controversy were this a competitive game. Clarke must take solace from the flowing nature of Scotland\u2019s play. Craig Gordon was judged to have upended the Poland substitute Krzysztof Piatek, with the goalkeeper unable to block the same player\u2019s penalty. Replays suggested there was no contact between Gordon and his opponent. Poland thereby snatched a draw they barely deserved, with the frustrations of those in navy blue endorsing their now lofty standards. The spot kick was Poland\u2019s second shot on target.  \u201cIt\u2019s a penalty decision for a friendly game and that\u2019s the best way to leave it,\u201d said a diplomatic Clarke. \u201cObviously we wanted to continue the winning run. It\u2019s a disappointment but it isn\u2019t the end of the world.\u201d That the match programme\u2019s front cover was simply an image of the Ukrainian flag pointed towards abnormal circumstances. Hampden Park was supposed to stage a World Cup playoff semi-final between the Scots and Ukraine on this very evening. Poland were due to take on Russia. Events thousands of miles from Glasgow altered that landscape entirely. To their credit, Scotland and Poland came together when insisting on a charitable element to this friendly. Unicef\u2019s efforts in Ukraine are to be directly assisted by funds raised from the fixture. Sometimes, football really can be a force for good. Poland\u2019s situation was different from that of their hosts in that they will play to reach the World Cup on Tuesday evening. It was no surprise, then, to see Robert Lewandowski named among the substitutes here. There remains a hope \u2013 if perhaps a forlorn one \u2013 that Scotland can face Ukraine in June. If it isn\u2019t crass to point as much out, given the human tragedy which continues to unfold in Ukraine, Scotland\u2019s prospects in respect of Qatar and the finals remains wholly unclear. Clarke and his employers have been consistent that they will be guided entirely by Fifa, Uefa and the Ukranian FA. Polish concern surrounded the enforced removal of Arkadiusz Milik, who limped off inside the opening half hour. Both teams had created chances until that point, in a match that was far from cagey. The atmosphere created by 39,000 helped in that respect. Poland were roared on by a sizeable and vociferous support while Scotland fixtures, for so long grim and unpopular affairs, have become trendy again on Clarke\u2019s watch. Che Adams stung the palms of Lukasz Skorupski from 22 yards as Scotland chased a breakthrough before the interval. Billy Gilmour forced the Poland goalkeeper into an even better save. As Bartosz Salamon was removed from proceedings because of injury before the break, the new Poland head coach, Czeslaw Michniewicz, had cause to question the football validity of this encounter. Earlier, Salamon had fired a free header wastefully over Gordon\u2019s crossbar.  Piatek, Milik\u2019s replacement, should have sent Poland ahead within three minutes of the restart. Jakub Moder had split the Scotland defence with a terrific pass but Piatek, with time and space on his side, screwed a shot well wide of Gordon\u2019s goal. Scotland, minus their captain Andy Robertson, were playing the more attractive football. Callum McGregor and Gilmour provided midfield fluidity. Nathan Patterson, with just 45 minutes against Boreham Wood to his name since swapping Rangers for Everton in January, surely afforded Frank Lampard food for thought given his prominence in Scotland colours.  John McGinn will contemplate whether he should have tumbled after rounding Skorupski from Gilmour\u2019s through pass. Replays were inconclusive as to whether the Aston Villa midfielder was clipped by the diving goalkeeper but McGinn\u2019s over-running of the ball halted what had been a promising Scottish position. To fall or not to dive became a post-match theme. Piatek\u2019s next opportunity was a glorious one. Poland broke sharply after Scott McTominay had stumbled over the ball on the halfway line. Piatek steadied himself and blasted a shot to beat Gordon, only for Gilmour to produce a terrific diving clearance. Gilmour has tenacity to match undoubted skill. McTominay, quite appropriately, was the first to hail his teammate. Clarke introduced Bologna\u2019s Aaron Hickey for a long-awaited full international debut. The teenager\u2019s first act was to join in a group celebration. McGinn whipped in a menacing free-kick from the right flank which Tierney stooped to head home, his first goal for Scotland on his 31st cap. Tierney\u2019s performances as a marauding left-sided centre-back have been a key constituent of Scotland\u2019s upward trajectory under Clarke.  Quite logically given earlier personnel issues, Poland left Lewandowski sitting on their bench. Piatek, belatedly, took on the scoring mantle as Scotland complained. \u201cWe were good tonight,\u201d added Clarke with typical understatement. He was correct."

                    "body": "A Western Australian jockey has been given a six-week suspension for his role in a collision that cost the life of racehorse Chili is Hot at the Perth Cup on Sunday. The incident renewed calls from some animal welfare advocates to end horse racing in Australia.  Chili Is Hot, a five-year-old mare, was euthanised on the track at Ascot racecourse after a collision with another horse roughly 200 metres into the race in front of about 10,000 spectators. The other horse involved, Dom To Shoot, suffered abrasions and was left slightly lame after the incident. Initial reports suggest Chili is Hot clipped the heels of the horse in front of her, Buster Bash, and went down in the crowded pack, with Dom To Shoot unable to stop in time and running over the top of her. Jockey Joseph Azzopardi was riding Buster Bash. The incident was subject to a stewards\u2019 inquiry by Racing and Wagering WA on Monday, which examined footage of the fall and interviewed six jockeys who participated in the race. Azzopardi pleaded guilty to carless riding for allowing his mount to shift outwards when not sufficiently clear of Chili is Hot.  Jockey Peter Knuckey, who was riding Chili is Hot, and Jordan Turner, aboard Dom To Shoot, were cleared of serious injury. The incident led to the Perth Cup being called off for the first time in its 136-year history. The race will be rerun on 14 January. Race caller Darren McCauley said the crowd fell silent after the accident. \u201cThe crowd went from a mighty roar to utter disbelief,\u201d he told Channel Seven. James Oldring, the chief executive of Perth Racing, said it was \u201cone of the hardest events for anyone involved with racing to deal with\u201d. \u201cThe welfare of jockeys and horses is always our top priority,\u201d he said. \u201cOur thoughts are with all those connected with Chili Is Hot.\u201d An RSPCA WA spokesperson said \u201cthe fatality further highlights the need for changes to the thoroughbred racing industry\u201d. \u201cRacehorses are at risk of harm during races, training and trials with the main types of injuries involving muscle, bones, tendons and ligaments,\u201d they said. \u201cSerious injuries such as fractures and ruptured ligaments or tendons which cause pain or distress, and cannot be treated, should result in immediate euthanasia.\u201d Elio Celotto, campaign director at the Coalition for the Protection of Racehorses, said he was saddened but not surprised by the fatality. A report prepared by the activist group, using data collected by state and territory racing bodies, found that 139 horses either died or suffered a life-ending injury on Australian racetracks between 1 August 2021 and 31 July 2022. Celotto, whose organisation created the \u201cnup to the cup\u201d campaign in opposition to the Melbourne Cup, said public sentiment about horse racing was changing.  \u201cSince the high-profile deaths of horses in the Melbourne Cup, we have seen the majority of people actually feeling its not something they want to support,\u201d Celotto said. \u201cWhat happened yesterday is a perfect example with these horses put in such dangerous situations that inevitably some of them will be injured and some of them will be killed.\u201d Lonergan Research polling, commissioned by the Greens earlier this year, found 54% of people surveyed thought horses should not be raced for gambling and entertainment. Even more (59%) thought it was cruel."

Thanks for reading this MBM. Nighty night!\n\n\n\nUpdated at 9.22pm GMT\n\n\n 9.18pm  \n\nWe have people with cameras. They\u2019ve been out and about, and have found some perky Americans in a fan zone. Here they are \u2026\n\n\u2026 and the team themselves are pretty bullish too, Christian Pulisic telling Fox Sports: \u201cIt\u2019s all about winning the game, so we\u2019ve got to come out very aggressive ... to get to the next round. I\u2019m very confident we can do it.\u201d\n\nUpdated at 9.32pm GMT\n\n\n 9.14pm  \n\nGareth Southgate speaks to the station formerly known as Tyne Tees. \u201cIt was exactly the sort of game I thought it would be. A good opponent who were very athletic. I knew it would be difficult after such a high to replicate that type of performance, so I\u2019m really pleased how the players applied themselves. Some of the quality in the final third could have been a little bit better, but we\u2019ve shown great resilience to defend against opponents who kept asking questions. We controlled the game well from the back, but were just not able to open up with that clear-cut chance. We didn\u2019t quite have the same zip, but that\u2019s going to happen. This is tournament football, we\u2019re not going to roll through a tournament, and sweep through everybody without having nights like that, when you\u2019ve got to show different qualities to get the result. It will be a totally different game against Wales. Silver medal today was a point. It puts us in a really strong position in terms of qualification. If we can win our last game, we win the group.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n 9.07pm  \n\nHarry Maguire also talks to the station formerly known as LWT. \u201cWe wasn\u2019t at our best, but it\u2019s a point and it puts us in a strong position in our group. We know they are a good team, they play at a big tempo and we had to work hard. They had a couple of chances, but if we were more clinical with ours we\u2019d have probably won the game. We\u2019ll take the positive parts but work on the parts we need to improve on. World Cup games are tough. They\u2019re all top teams at this World Cup. We wasn\u2019t ruthless enough in the final third, but we have good forwards and I\u2019m sure the next game we\u2019ll be all right. We dug in and got the clean sheet. We stay in control of the group. Of course we wanted to win tonight and see the job through, but we\u2019re looking forward to the game against Wales now.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n 9.01pm  \n\nHarry Kane speaks to ITV. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t our best performance for sure. We had some good spells, created some good positions, but we didn\u2019t quite have the final product today. A great clean sheet that puts us in a great position in the group. We weren\u2019t clinical. The complete contrast against Iran, we took our chances really well. Today we had two or three good opportunities but didn\u2019t put them away. But overall we were playing a tough team, and we move on. At times we dealt with their press well. They\u2019re a good side, and you have to respect them. A draw ain\u2019t the end of the world, and we look forward to the next one. We know we can play better. It\u2019s a draw at a World Cup. No game is easy. People thought after our first performance we would landslide every team, but that\u2019s not the case. It leaves us in a really good position.\u201d\n\n\n\n 8.58pm  \n\nQuite a few boos greeted that full-time whistle. Quite a few England fans still not happy with Gareth Southgate. Tonight\u2019s performance was as limp as Monday\u2019s showing against Iran was effervescent. The USMNT were the better side, creating more chances, creating better chances, and hitting the bar. A fair bit of the feelgood factor surrounding England will have dissipated tonight. But some good news for Southgate and his side: this result means England are as good as through to the knockouts. They\u2019ll only miss out if Wales whack them by four goals next Tuesday. All four teams in Group B can still qualify.\n\n\n\n\n 8.52pm  \nFULL TIME: England 0-0 USA\n\nPulisic takes the point, rolling the free kick down the flank towards the corner flag, Reyna waiting for the whistle. And then that whistle blows. England still haven\u2019t beaten the USA at a World Cup!\n\n\n\nUpdated at 8.59pm GMT\n\n\n 8.51pm  \n\n90 min +4: Maybe one last chance for the US to snatch it! Maguire skittles Reyna to the ground, and Pulisic will swing one in from the right flank. \n\n\n\n 8.51pm  \n\n90 min +3: Shaw curls a stunning free kick into the mixer. Kane wins a header six yards out, only to send it off the top of his noggin and wide left. Huge chance to snatch what would have been, quite frankly, an undeserved win.\n\n\n\n 8.49pm  \n\n90 min +2: Another Grealish run, another free kick, drawn this time from Musah. A free kick in a dangerous position out on the left. Shaw to loop into a crowded box.\n\n\n\n 8.49pm  \n\n90 min +1: Maguire meets the corner, heading down. The ball softly bounces up into Turner\u2019s arms.\n\n\n\n 8.48pm  \n\n90 min: Henderson wins a free kick out on the right. It\u2019s taken quickly, Henderson\u2019s cross forcing Robinson to head out for a corner. It\u2019ll be taken during the first of four added minutes.\n\n\nUpdated at 8.50pm GMT\n\n\n 8.47pm  \n\n88 min: Pulisic, on the edge of the England box, finds Moore in the area to the right. A first-time ball through the six-yard box would have England in all sorts of trouble, but Moore hesitates, then cuts back to nobody in particular. England breathe again.\n\n\n\n 8.44pm  \n\n87 min: A little bit of space for Rashford, just to the left of the US D. He looks to curl one into the top right. No whip, no pace, and it\u2019s an easy claim for Turner.\n\n\n\n 8.44pm  \n\n86 min: England faff about in their own half for a while. The US let them get on with it. The clock ticks on.\n\n\n\n 8.42pm  \n\n85 min: The ball falls in the general environs of Maguire \u2026 but Ream reads the danger and gets in the way to blooter clear.\n\n\n\n 8.41pm  \n\n84 min: Grealish does what Grealish does, drawing a foul from the opposition out on the left wing. Everyone lines up on the edge of the American box. Shaw to take.\n\n\n\n 8.41pm  \n\n83 min: Gregg Berhalter, having listened to Tracy Moir, sends on Reyna. He replaces Weah, and is one of two changes, Wright making way for Sargent.\n\n\n\n 8.39pm  \n\n81 min: Henderson flings a garryowen into the US box. A bit early for this sort of desperation, but there it is. Turner claims under pressure from Kane. \u201cUSA fans are wondering why Reyna isn\u2019t on yet to bring some pace,\u201d writes Tracy Mohr. \u201cOur coach is not admired for his substitution nous.\u201d\n\n\n\n 8.37pm  \n\n79 min 49 sec: After coming on against Iran last Monday, Rashford had scored by now.\n\n\n\n 8.36pm  \n\n79 min: Rashford comes on for Saka.\n\n\n\n 8.36pm  \n\n78 min: Moore and Aaronson come on for McKennnie and a not particularly chuffed Dest. \u201cHere is Australia SBS TV have the World Cup and Martin Tyler as the commentator,\u201d begins Craig Fillingham. \u201cHe is on his own, so no one can help fill this game\u2019s void. In the first half, he actually spelt the Antonee of Antonee Robinson as he explained it was such a different way of spelling Anthony. Not criticising Tyler, but it is a reflection on the entertainment of the game.\u201d\n\n\n\n 8.33pm  \n\n76 min: England have certainly stemmed the flow of all those US attacks. They\u2019re not achieving much up the other end, but baby steps and all that. Meanwhile Jeremy Gostick writes: \u201cOn the basis of the Pickford/Bradford comment, I think you mean \u2018Notts County\u2019s Jack Grealish\u2019.\u201d My mistake. I humbly apologise.\n\n\n\n 8.31pm  \n\n74 min: Grealish is making his presence felt out on the left. A couple of dribbles down the flank. One nearly ends with him finding Kane in the box with a cutback, but the England captain is swarmed by blue shirts and the ball\u2019s cleared.\n\n\n\n 8.30pm  \n\n73 min: Dest is fine to continue. The game restarts.\n\n\n\n 8.30pm  \n\n72 min: Dest requires a spot of treatment after clattering into Shaw. \u201cIt\u2019s lucky that England have got the Iran game out of the way, because if you went by their respective performances today you\u2019d expect the latter to batter the former,\u201d notes K\u00e1ri Tulinius. \u201cFootball\u2019s a funny old sport.\u201d\n\n\n\n 8.28pm  \n\n70 min: Grealish dances in from the left, inviting a tackle that doesn\u2019t come. He eventually runs out of road just inside the box, but that got the English blood pumping for the first time in a while.\n\n\n\n 8.26pm  \n\n69 min: Kane and Saka try to unlock the US down the inside-right channel, but Musah slams the door shut and clears.\n\n\n\n 8.25pm  \n\n68 min: England make a double change. Sterling and Bellingham off, Grealish and Henderson on.\n\n\n\n 8.24pm  \n\n66 min: England are doing very little by way of response to this US pressure. \u201cA game of this magnitude, you\u2019d think England would have played Kane and Sterling.\u201d Paul Pooley, ladies and gentlemen, he\u2019s here all week. Try the machb\u016bs.\n\n\nUpdated at 8.27pm GMT\n\n\n 8.22pm  \n\n64 min: Wright wins yet another US corner down the left, off Stones. Pulisic takes, and curls long. For a second, it looks as though the ball\u2019s going to fly over his head and into the top right, but Pickford of Bradford fingertips out for a corner on the right this time. Zimmerman was tearing in, too, so that\u2019s a doubly crucial intervention. Nothing comes of the next corner.\n\n\n\n 8.20pm  \n\n63 min: The USA continue to dominate. Their fans are giving it plenty. On the touchline, Gareth Southgate has the good grace to look concerned.\n\n\n\n 8.19pm  \n\n61 min: Robinson strides down the left and wins another US corner. That one leads to another, and from that one, Pulisic is found in a bit of space just inside the England box on the left. He should take a shot, but over-elaborates, dropping a shoulder to beat Shaw, who refuses to give way. England finally clear their lines.\n\n\n\n 8.17pm  \n\n59 min: Pulisic cuts in from the left and is allowed to pass four men too easily. His shot is deflected wide left. Bradford City\u2019s Jordan Pickford gives his defenders the what-for. The resulting corner is headed clear by Maguire, under pressure from Zimmerman.\n\n\nUpdated at 8.18pm GMT\n\n\n 8.15pm  \n\n57 min: Weah cuts back from an advanced position on the right, nearly finding the in-rushing Musah. Bellingham reads the danger and intercepts just before the US midfielder can shoot. \u201cPlease note Guardian house style,\u201d begins Matt Tempest, formerly of this parish and therefore well schooled in finger-wagging. \u201cAt all times, England\u2019s keeper must be referred to as \u2018Bradford City\u2019s Jordan Pickford\u2019, on account of him playing a season at Valley Parade, on loan from Sunderland, in 2014-15. One game of which I saw. It\u2019s not often you see a future England star at Valley Parade.\u201d\n\n\n\n 8.13pm  \n\n55 min: Play restarts. Weah all good. Meanwhile here\u2019s some more pessimism from over the briny, courtesy of Peter Donley: \u201cI feel like the US team is being toyed with by the dominant English side. I\u2019ve seen more compassion with my family cat playing with a caught mouse.\u201d\n\n\n\n 8.11pm  \n\n54 min: Play stops for a moment as Weah gets some treatment, his foot having been accidentally stepped on by Shaw.\n\n\n\n 8.10pm  \n\n53 min: A chance for Mount to scamper into space down the middle. He miscontrols and allows the ball to sail through to Turner, who drops a shoulder to see off Sterling before passing clear.\n\n\n\n 8.09pm  \n\n51 min: Pulisic tears at pace down the left and has a chance of sending Musah free down the touchline, but his pass is no good. The USA have picked up where they left off. More of the same. England need to wake up quicksmart.\n\n\n\n 8.06pm  \n\n49 min: Space for Pulisic down the left. He lays off to Wright, whose shot is blocked by Stones. The ball breaks to McKennie, who blazes wildly over the bar. More composure and Pickford would have had some work to get on with.\n\n\n\n 8.05pm  \n\n48 min: A slow start to the second half. No obvious upsurge in England energy.\n\n\n\n 8.04pm  \n\n46 min: Meanwhile back home down Wembley Way, the FA have made their own One Love gesture.\n\n\n\n\n 8.02pm  \n\nThe USMNT get the second half underway. No changes made by either side during the break.\n\n\n\n 8.01pm  \n\nHalf-time Postbag O\u2019Pessimism. US supporter Liisa Sletzinger writes: \u201cProclamations that USMNT are dominating right now feel grossly overstated. We seem to be trying our hardest (and still can\u2019t shoot for crap) and England are yet to unleash.\u201d\nEngland fan John Davis adds: \u201cThe best thing about that half of football was finding out my local is doing two-pinters of Ghost Ship for \u00a34.40. This carries on and Wales can knock us out in Tuesday.\u201d\n\n\n\n 7.50pm  \nWho do you support?\n\nBefore you reach for the half-time oranges, please consider supporting Guardian journalism like this, for three reasons:\n\u2022 We are independent - no one tells us what we can and can\u2019t publish (and that includes Fifa)\u2022 We rely on readers funding us to keep us independent\u2022 We give you the full picture - the excitement on the pitch and the shame, corruption and injustice off it\nSupport the Guardian from as little as \u00a31 \u2013 it only takes a minute. Thank you.\n\n\n\n 7.48pm  \nHALF TIME: England 0-0 USA\n\nThe whistle goes after an extremely old-school period of added time: just one minute. The USA have been the better side. England head in to receive some tactical advice / a good classical rollocking.\n\n\nUpdated at 7.53pm GMT\n\n\n 7.46pm  \n\n45 min +1: Shaw rolls a pass in from the left for Sterling, who immediately flicks it down the channel for Mount. A first-time shot is fizzed towards the bottom left. Turner turns it around the post, then claims the resulting corner.\n\n\nUpdated at 7.51pm GMT\n\n\n 7.45pm  \n\n45 min: A bit of space down the right for Bellingham to sashay into. His long cross is hacked clear. Shaw picks up possession and comes down the left. He reaches the byline and cuts back for Saka, who improvises a flick that sails over the bar. Half a chance, that.\n\n\n\n 7.44pm  \n\n44 min: Shaw looks for Kane with a long diagonal from the left flank. Turner \u2013 confidence restored, those first-minute wobbles an awfully long time ago \u2013 comes out to claim without fuss.\n\n\n\n 7.43pm  \n\n43 min: Dest whips in from the right. Pulisic heads harmlessly wide left. Pickford shepherds the ball out for a goal kick. England could do with hearing the half-time whistle.\n\n\n\n 7.42pm  \n\n42 min: Dest tears clear on the overlap down the right. He drops a shoulder to cut into the box and looks for the top left. His shot deflects out off Maguire, who stuck to his task well. Maguire hoicks Pulisic\u2019s corner clear.\n\n\n\n 7.41pm  \n\n40 min: Space for Wright down the right. His cross is too long and high for Pulisic, who was in a bit of space in the middle. For what it\u2019s worth \u2013 and what it\u2019s worth is 0p (0\u00a2) \u2013 the USA are winning this on points.\n\n\n\n 7.40pm  \n\n39 min: McKennie throws long into the England box from the right. Wright spins and attempts to take on Maguire near the byline. He can\u2019t get past but Maguire is forced to poke out for a corner. Nothing comes of the set piece, but the USA have the upper hand now. \n\n\n\n 7.38pm  \n\n38 min: The US look determined to catch England cold on the turn. McKennie takes a super-quick throw down the right wing and nearly releases Weah. A simple gambit, but it nearly works. England are being asked a few questions here.\n\nUpdated at 7.39pm GMT\n\n\n 7.37pm  \n\n36 min: Shaw crosses in low from the left. Bellingham tries to flick cutely goalwards but can\u2019t connect. Turner eventually takes control and hoofs long towards Pulisic down the left, who is only just beaten to the ball by Stones, racing across from the middle. A crucial intervention by Stones. Without it, Pulisic was free and England were in all sorts of bother.\n\n\n\n 7.35pm  \n\n34 min: Maguire on the left wing again. This time he can\u2019t control, the ball clanking off his shin. Inner Garrincha all gone away!\n\n\n\n 7.34pm  \n\n33 min: McKennie makes good down the right. Musah shuttles the ball left to Pulisic, who drops a shoulder to make time and space before sending a rising shot towards the top-left corner. It beats Pickford but crashes off the bar and out for a goal kick. The USA are gaining in confidence all right!\n\n\n\nUpdated at 7.40pm GMT\n\n\n 7.32pm  \n\n31 min: McKennie accidentally catches Mount in the face. No malice, no yellow.\n\n\n\n 7.31pm  \n\n30 min: Musah is upended by Stones, and that\u2019s another England player who is slightly lucky not to see yellow. \u201cI really feel like watching England would be a lot, lot easier if we could convert Harry Maguire into a midfielder or centre-forward,\u201d begins James Dixon. No, hear him out. \u201cEvery time he has the ball in our half I can feel my chest tightening, yet whenever he\u2019s in possession in the opposition half, I feel the same kind of spontaneous and irrepressible joy I\u2019d get watching an adorable Newfoundland puppy playing in snow for the first time.\u201d\n\n\n\n 7.29pm  \n\n29 min: Pulisic drives down the left and feeds Robinson, who in turn finds Musah. He sashays back infield and nearly runs into the referee, who doesn\u2019t know which way to go. The ref finally sorts himself out and buggers off out of the road, allowing Musah to take a shot that\u2019s deflected but nevertheless flies straight at Pickford, who claims. The US are growing in confidence.\n\n\n\n 7.28pm  \n\n28 min: Trippier slides in late on Robinson, and is slightly fortunate not to go into the book. There didn\u2019t appear to be any malicious intent, to be fair. Merely mistimed.\n\n\n\n 7.27pm  \n\n26 min: Pulisic spins into space and drives down the middle. The ball\u2019s shifted right to Dest, who reaches the byline before cutting back for Weah, who curls towards McKennie, in a bit of space near the penalty spot. The ball drops perfectly, but McKennie leans back and blazes over. He should have hit the target at the very least. He probably should have scored. The grim look on his coupon suggests he very much believes the latter. What a chance!\n\n\nUpdated at 7.31pm GMT\n\n\n 7.24pm  \n\n24 min: Maguire creams a lovely diagonal pass down the left for Sterling, who drives into the US box and nearly gets the better of Dest. Not quite. The ball then pinballs around before being launched away from danger.\n\n\n\n 7.23pm  \n\n22 min: England slow it down again. All very professional.\n\n\n\n 7.21pm  \n\n20 min: The US roll a few passes to each other, then Dest makes good down the right. He swings the ball into the England box with plenty of pace. Pickford plucks it from the sky and dispenses some on-the-nose advice to his team-mates.\n\n\n\n 7.20pm  \n\n18 min: England make sure the US don\u2019t start working up a head of steam, passing the ball around the back to re-establish a semblance of authority. With entertainment at a premium, the fans engage in a back-and-forth England! U!S!A! battle. A fine atmosphere. Hugh Molloy was spot on.\n\n\n\n 7.17pm  \n\n16 min: Shaw and Sterling attempt to link up down the left. Both hesitate. Shaw eventually trundles a pea-roller into the arms of Turner. The US counter and launch their first attack. A cross comes in from the right, and Wright gets ahead of Stones to flash a header wide of goal. The first sign of an American threat.\n\n\n\n 7.14pm  \n\n14 min: Saka again makes a nuisance of himself down the right, reaching the byline before standing one up for Kane. Robinson heads clear just in time, before Kane can connect.\n\n\nUpdated at 7.22pm GMT\n\n\n 7.13pm  \n\n13 min: Such a shame Maguire couldn\u2019t go all the way and walk the ball into the net. They\u2019d have had to stop the entire tournament there and then. Football would have been completed. Game over. Where else would there be to go after that?\n\n\n\n 7.12pm  \n\n11 min: Some top entertainment as the corner\u2019s hit long. Near the corner flag, Maguire channels his inner Garrincha \u2013 Harry Maguire channels his inner Garrincha \u2013 and dribbles past two people before the ball ricochets back to Mount, who blazes over.\n\n\n\n 7.10pm  \n\n10 min: Bellingham\u2019s clearly fine, because he exchanges crisp passes with Saka down the inside-right channel. Saka cuts back for Kane, whose low shot is deflected wide right for the game\u2019s first corner.\n\n\n\nUpdated at 7.25pm GMT\n\n\n 7.09pm  \n\n9 min: Wright and Bellingham crash into each other as they contest a 50-50 ball. Both grimace, but both get back up.\n\n\n\n 7.08pm  \n\n8 min: England are enjoying more of the ball, but to little effect. The US are pressing them all the way.\n\n\n\n 7.06pm  \n\n6 min: Weah isn\u2019t too far away from closing down a hesitant Maguire, but the England man gets the ball out from under his feet and away in the nick of time. Yep, not too much to report yet.\n\n\n\n 7.04pm  \n\n4 min: Robinson tries to take on Trippier down the left, but loses the first battle of the evening. Throw to England. It\u2019s been a fairly quiet start, tell the truth.\n\n\n\n 7.03pm  \n\n3 min: Kane puts Turner under some more pressure. The US keeper appears a wee bit nervous during these early exchanges. He correctly executes his big hoof this time.\n\n\n\n 7.01pm  \n\n1 min: England pass it around the back in the patient style. Maguire and Stones giving each other a few touches. Then the ball\u2019s shuttled upfield, where US keeper Turner shanks a clearance into the stand. Ironic cheers. A fine atmosphere at the Al-Bayt Stadium by the sounds of it.\n\n\n\n 7.00pm  \n\nEngland get the ball rolling. They take the knee beforehand.\n\n\n\n 6.58pm  \n\nThe teams are out! England are dressed from tip to toe in white, changing their shorts because the normally similarly bedecked USA\u2019s second-choice colours are blue. They sing their anthems. Mason Mount gets the lyrics of God Save The Queen (King remix) correct this time. The Star Spangled Banner is a much better number \u2026 so belated Thanksgiving thanks to John Stafford Smith and Francis Scott Key for that. We\u2019ll be off in a couple of minutes.\n\n\nUpdated at 7.00pm GMT\n\n\n 6.52pm  \n\nGareth Southgate talks to ITV. \u201cYou\u2019re always wondering whether you should refresh things, but this team deserved to go again. If I was a player I\u2019d feel I\u2019d earned the right. We\u2019ve got great competition for places, but we were right to go with the same team. The USA put you under a lot of pressure and press well. It\u2019ll be a different game and we have to find solutions. We have to be positive. We overcame the first challenge really well but that is done. This is a different sort of challenge.\u201d\n\n\n\n 6.47pm  \n\nPre-match firework display. Doha sure looks pretty at night. Meanwhile in other it-all-goes-off news, here\u2019s Hugh Molloy: \u201cI\u2019m at the ground and the atmosphere is feral compared to England-Iran. Friday in Arabia is the first day of the weekend. All the expats have been at all-you-can-drink brunches (because Qatar is dry, right!) from noon and are on it. Going to be different.\u201d\n\n\nUpdated at 6.50pm GMT\n\n\n 6.02pm  \n\nEngland are in full If It Ain\u2019t Broke mode. Having beaten Iran 6-2, Gareth Southgate names the same starting XI. That means Harry Kane has passed a fitness test on that dodgy ankle, while Harry Maguire has got over the illness that truncated his contribution last Monday. \nGregg Berhalter makes just one change to the side that started the 1-1 draw with Wales. Haji Wright of Turkish S\u00fcper Lig club Antalyaspor replaces Josh Sargent of Norwich City. There are five Premier League players starting tonight for the US: captain Tyler Adams (Leeds United), Christian Pulisic (Chelsea), Tim Ream and Antonee Robinson (Fulham) and Matt Turner (Arsenal).\n\n\n\n 5.55pm  \nThe teams\n\nEngland: Pickford, Trippier, Stones, Maguire, Shaw, Bellingham, Rice, Saka, Mount, Sterling, Kane.Subs: Walker, Grealish, Henderson, Rashford, Pope, Phillips, Dier, Coady, Alexander-Arnold, Foden, White, Ramsdale, Wilson, Gallagher.\nUSA: Turner, Dest, Zimmerman, Ream, Robinson, McKennie, Adams, Musah, Weah, Wright, Pulisic.Subs: Reyna, Ferreira, Aaronson, Horvath, de la Torre, Long, Morris, Roldan, Moore, Carter-Vickers, Yedlin, Acosta, Sargent, Johnson, Scally.\nReferee: Jes\u00fas Valenzuela (Venezuela).\n\n\n\nUpdated at 6.17pm GMT\n\n\n 5.53pm  \n\nTonight\u2019s USMNT. One change from the Wales match, with Haji Wright replacing Josh Sargent.\n\n\n\n\n 5.47pm  \n\nThe England team. Harry Kane fit, then.\n\n\nUpdated at 5.50pm GMT\n\n\n 5.42pm  \n\nThis is how Group B looks in the wake of Wales 0-2 Iran. Late, late heartbreak for Wales fans, who nevertheless gave Iran a wonderful reception as they went on a lap of honour.\n\n\n\n\n\n 5.30pm  \nPreamble\n\nEngland first played the USA at the World Cup in 1950. As every schoolchild knows, it didn\u2019t go well for them.\n\nIt didn\u2019t go particularly well for them in 2010 either. Poor Rob.\n\nThird time lucky? A win tonight for Gareth Southgate\u2019s side will secure qualification for the knockout stage, and top spot in Group B. Hopes are high after that 6-2 rout of Iran. The USMNT\u2019s unremarkable 1-1 draw with Wales isn\u2019t quite so inspiring, but those two aforementioned World Cup meetings will give them succour, even if they\u2019ve not beaten the English since the days of Graham Taylor. Kick-off is at 7pm GMT, 2pm ET and 10pm at the Al-Bayt Stadium in Al Khor. \u0627\u0646\u0647 \u064a\u062d\u062f\u062b! It\u2019s on!\n\n"

                    "body": "Beth Mead says her third England hat-trick in six months shows her confidence has been restored. The goals came after she was dropped from the national team and the Team GB Olympic squad and Mead believes she has \u201cchannelled my disappointment in the correct way\u201d. After England\u2019s 10-0 defeat of North Macedonia in Skopje on Friday, she said: \u201cI never thought I would have scored a hat-trick in all these qualifiers. We can let these things break us or we can use them as motivation and I think it motivated me this season to do better on and off the pitch. I can control what I\u2019m doing and enjoy my football. Hopefully that\u2019s showing on the pitch. I\u2019m confident and that\u2019s really showing.\u201d  Mead said not flying to Tokyo was a blow but she is using the setback to help recover her best form in an England shirt. \u201cI\u2019m in between,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m over it, but I can also still try and use it in the right way to motivate me. \u201cThere were a lot of question over that decision, but I have to accept that, swallow it. Some people can let it affect them but I\u2019ve used it in the right way and I\u2019m getting the rewards of it.\u201d Part of that uplift has come because the new manager, Sarina Wiegman, has helped her this season. \u201cI\u2019ve come into this season and played with confidence, not overthought my game too much,\u201d said Mead. \u201cI know I have the capabilities to be a good player and do good things on the pitch. Last season I maybe got into my head a bit too much and Sarina has settled me, given me confidence, starts in some games, and I\u2019ve really relished playing under her.\u201d Mead has further benefited from Lauren Hemp\u2019s blistering work on the opposite flank, which was evident against North Macedonia. \u201cIt\u2019s super nice to play with Lauren and Ellen [White] up top,\u201d said Mead. \u201cLauren can beat any full-back in the world and sometimes you know if you get in the box she\u2019ll produce a good cross or a good effort and you get on the rebound. A couple of them happened today and that\u2019s why I got on the end of them \u2013 her positive play sometimes becomes my positive play.\u201d Her first goal started with a Hemp cross Mead slammed into the roof of the net at the far post after White struggled to connect. Her third came from another Hemp cross and her fourth was poked in after the goalkeeper, Viktorija Panchurov, parried a Hemp shot. Mead\u2019s second was a neat, dinked effort over Panchurov that slipped inside the far post just ahead of the waiting White.  The Arsenal forward walked into the press conference clutching a match ball. She was flanked by Ella Toone who held another match ball after her second hat-trick in the same period, having made her senior debut in February 2021. \u201cIt\u2019s so good to share this moment with Beth,\u201d said Toone, whose second goal came after Mead knocked the ball down to her unmarked in the middle.

                    "body": "With 23 minutes gone there was a moment of uproar inside the Cardiff City Stadium as Harry Wilson was blocked off outside the Austria penalty area; uproar that gave way almost immediately as Szymon Marciniak blew his whistle for the free-kick. Suddenly the air was alive with a weird kind of buzz, like the moment in a storm just before the lightning bolt hits and things start to lift: the hairs on your arms, seats flipped up, people in the stands starting to raise their hands above their heads. Gareth Bale paced it out and waited, charging the moment a little more.  There is a concept doing the rounds called \u201cmain character energy\u201d. It describes those people who communicate at all times the certainty that whatever might be happening around them, they are the main character in this scene. A way of standing, talking, entering a room. It says: the camera is on me. This is my close-up. Thanks so much for coming. This is quite a handy notion in sport. Main character energy: sports people need this stuff. Although not too much of it. And ideally, you actually are the main character. Welcome to Cardiff, \u00d6sterreichische Fussballnationalmannschaft. And thanks, really, for coming. Up to that point Bale had touched the ball 12 times. He\u2019d floated a header wide. He\u2019d tried to do some pressing. But was there ever any real doubt, as the ball was spotted and Bale took three paces back, who was doing the voiceover here, the cutaways? Not that this was ever really going to work. Just look at the theatre of it. One-off game, win or bust. The home crowd hero. His first real sighter. Of course it\u2019s thrilling, of course the crowd rises and stiffens. But people don\u2019t score goals like this. It\u2019s too difficult. It\u2019s also too difficult. The ball was 35 yard or so from goal at an angle. Heinz Lindner had a full wall in place. There was only one spot Bale could put it, and that would require dip, power and perfect accuracy. He\u2019s rusty. It\u2019s early on. Just saying, don\u2019t get your hopes \u2026 don\u2019t think that \u2026 Oh.  Bale took a hop, four steps, then hit the ball with the top of his foot in the familiar style. It wasn\u2019t really a spank or a rocket, but a clip: all about the rhythm and the ping; and let\u2019s just say it, with something of the golf shot. What was strange was the trajectory, the ball leaping, dipping, then travelling on in a flat line like a missile. Lindner stopped and craned his neck to look up as that lovely white orb, picked out in the cold Cardiff lights, grazed the bar and went spinning down in an orderly parabola, a thing of beauty even in that moment of hush before the seats erupted. In the stands people hugged and tumbled over one another. What really lingered was the softness in Bale\u2019s movements: perfect, hard-honed technique executed under pressure, but with an ease that spoke to something spreading back up the foot, the years spent slow-cooking that feeling of team culture, of shared momentum. In that moment Bale really was at home, doing home things.  The Cardiff City Stadium had been a slightly angsty place at kick-off. The Welsh anthem \u2013 a top three world anthem, up there with France and Italy \u2013 was, as ever, a stirring thing. And this World Cup playoff semi-final was a beautifully streamlined piece of staging. No need to consider developments elsewhere. Just win at home, then win the next one too. Fittingly enough for a high\u2011stakes, one-off casino trip of a game, Robert Page had loaded up every chip and swept it all into play. When it\u2019s win or bust, well, it makes a lot of sense to try for the win. So Page picked a team with all the players. A midfield of Joe Allen, Aaron Ramsey and Wilson was never likely to die wondering. In attack Wales had Bale and Daniel James, one to ferret and press for two men, one to provide the fantasy, the vibes. It did leave them open. On four minutes there was a moment of jaw-drop as Christoph Baumgartner strolled in on goal and saw the ball clang back off the bar. At times here was a large green space at the heart of this Welsh team, Allen trundling gamely around trying to fill the space like a lone forklift truck in an abandoned hangar.  Bale did little early on. This is fine. He doesn\u2019t have to do anything, until he does the thing. And on 51 minutes he did it again to make it 2-0. This was a wonderful team move, Ben Davies holding the ball, Bale taking it off his toe, and swinging it back across and into the top corner. Marcel Sabitzer\u2019s shot, deflected in off Davies, made it 2-1 with just under half an hour still to run. James kept passing up the chance to kill the game, but somehow this was always going one way. There is another act to play in this ensemble drama. But for one night only in Cardiff there was no doubt who was playing centre stage."

Williamson was on the fringes at the 2019 Women\u2019s World Cup, with the six minutes the Arsenal defender played against Cameroon, having been brought on as a late substitute by Phil Neville, her only action of the tournament in France. Not only is Williamson set to be in the starting XI when the Euros get going at Old Trafford on 6 July but she will do so wearing the armband.  \u201cI followed her before I came in here as the manager, she\u2019s a very talented player,\u201d said Wiegman, England\u2019s head coach. \u201cNow, she has so many more high-level and high-intensity games in her legs and in her brain. That has really helped her. She\u2019s more mature, she can still grow \u2013 I\u2019m still growing, we\u2019re all still growing every day \u2013 but she\u2019s ready for the opportunity on and off the pitch.\u201d Wiegman denied there was a risk in making someone with so little major tournament experience the national team captain at a home Euros. She said: \u201cShe\u2019s herself and she won\u2019t be a different person when she wears the armband. I do think that we have shared responsibilities, so what we shouldn\u2019t do is put it all on the shoulders of Leah. As a team we all have responsibilities and, when it\u2019s needed, she steps up and talks or uses her way of leadership.\u201d England will be without Williamson for the game in Skopje as the 25-year-old has missed training and been under precautionary concussion protocols. The hope is she will be fit for Tuesday\u2019s game with Northern Ireland. \u201cShe is doing well,\u201d said Wiegman. \u201cShe came into camp good, but we didn\u2019t want to take any risks. She had a little bit of a headache, so we take the medical protocols. She just needs to take a little more time in her programme to build her up. Also, no heading [in training] so she\u2019s not ready for the game on Friday.\u201d  Sign up for our new and free women\u2019s football newsletter!  England will also be without Williamson\u2019s Arsenal centre-back partner Lotte Wubben-Moy and Manchester City defender Alex Greenwood for Friday\u2019s game. The pair have not travelled because of knee and thigh injuries respectively. Everton\u2019s Gabby George, who was in camp with the Under-23s, has been called in. Looking ahead to the Euros, Wiegman believes her squad is in a \u201cgood place\u201d, adding: \u201cYou always want more as a coach, more time, but the time schedule is so clear, you have this time, these camps, and that\u2019s what you have and you have to do your job. \u201cI was really happy with the games we had in February, they were really competitive, this is another opponent, we all know the reason why we play these matches [so close to the Euros], because Covid delayed things, so we just have to deal with the situation and be agile.

The TV coverage would begin at 10am with TV reporters from BBC and ITV joining the players of both teams in their hotel dining rooms for breakfast, before travelling with them on their coaches to \u2026 er, the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff.\nIn those days, they\u2019d all be suited and booted for the day and viewers would be treated to footage of them playing cards, chatting, sitting frozen in nervous terror or listening to their Walkmans (ask your folks). Invariably, some luckless sod from each team that happened to be missing the game through injury would be roped into introducing assorted teammates he thought might up for a bit of performative \u201cbanter\u201d for the cameras. Then at 3pm, after hours of buildup the teams would kick off and 90 or 120 minutes later the famous old trophy would be handed over.\n\nIn the intervening years, it has not gone unnoticed that the FA Cup has lost so much of its magic, that even the act of pointing out it has lost its magic has lost its magic. Indeed, you could now go so far as to say that we have reached the point of peak FA Cup magic-loss, in so far as pointing out that the competition has lost its magic has not only lost its magic, but even pointing out that pointing out it has lost its magic has lost its magic.\nBut while FA Cup final day is a pale facsimile of the great day it once was, it is still a showpiece event well worth winning.

                    "body": "Middle Eastern states are to land a $1.3tn (\u00a31.09tn) windfall from extra oil revenues over the next four years, according to the International Monetary Fund. The IMF said on Friday it expected oil and gas exporters in the region, notably the Gulf states, to benefit from high prices and opportunities to ramp up their market share. The oil and gas sector is in flux after Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, which has upended markets and sent prices soaring. Russia has increased exports of oil to Asian nations, while Vladimir Putin\u2019s tactic of limiting gas supplies into Europe has left countries seeking new supply sources. Jihad Azour, the IMF\u2019s director for the Middle East and north Africa, told the Financial Times that countries in the Middle East could expect to receive $1.3tn more in cumulative revenues than was forecast before the invasion of Ukraine. He said Gulf states needed to use the windfall to \u201cinvest in the future\u201d, including efforts to switch towards greener energy sources. \u201cIt\u2019s an important moment for them to \u2026 accelerate in sectors like technology [domestically] as this is something that will allow them to increase productivity,\u201d Azour said. \u201cIn addition, their investment strategy could benefit from the fact that asset prices have improved for new investors, and the capacity to increase their market share in certain areas are also opportunities.\u201d The windfall is expected to benefit some of the world\u2019s biggest sovereign wealth funds, including the Qatar Investment Authority, Saudi Arabia\u2019s Public Investment Fund (PIF), the Kuwait Investment Authority and Abu Dhabi\u2019s Mubadala and ADQ. Gulf states are expected to spend the proceeds of the oil boom on building huge infrastructure projects, as well as investing overseas. Azour said: \u201cWhat is going to be really important is how they [Gulf states] manage this new cycle and how they maintain, at the same time, the benefits of the additional liquidity and the policies that will not lead them into pro-cyclicality.\u201d The IMF predicted the Gulf Cooperation Council \u2013 which includes the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Bahrain, Oman and Qatar \u2013 would collectively increase economic growth by 6.4% this year, from 2.7% growth last year. Last weekend, Saudi Arabia\u2019s largely state-owned energy firm, Saudi Aramco, underscored the colossal profits made by gas- and oil-rich countries during the energy crisis by revealing that profits in the three months to the end of June jumped 90% to $48bn. It is one of the largest quarterly profits in corporate history and represents a fillip for PIF, a backer of the company. PIF, chaired by the crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, invested more than $7.5bn in US stocks in the second quarter of the year, including Amazon and PayPal. The energy crisis shows little sign of easing, after the Russian state gas company, Gazprom, warned this week that European gas prices could soar by 60% to more than $4,000 per 1,000 cubic metres this winter. On Friday, Wolfgang Kubicki, the vice-president of the German parliament, said Germany should allow the blocked Nord Stream 2 (NS2) pipeline to begin pumping Russian natural gas so \u201cpeople do not have to freeze in winter and that our industry does not suffer serious damage\u201d. There are fears of blackouts in Germany this winter as the country faces the prospect of a potential recession. Ukraine\u2019s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, rebuked Kubicki, likening politicians\u2019 demands to temporarily switch the pipeline on to a \u201cdrug addiction\u201d. He said: \u201cCalls by some German politicians to launch NS2 for a little while and close it later are totally irrational. \u201cThis resembles drug addiction, when a person says: \u2018Just one last time!\u2019 without realising the devastating consequences of each \u2018last time\u2019. Addiction to Russian gas kills!\u201d The extent of the energy crisis in Britain is expected to be laid bare on 26 August when Ofgem sets the next industry price cap, which will be implemented in October. The cap is expected to rise from \u00a31,971 to \u00a33,582."

                    "body": "The Heineken Cup was universally recognised for years as the great success story of the professional era. It is the same age, the first match played on Halloween in 1995, a Tuesday night, on the shores of the Black Sea, when Toulouse beat Farul Constanta of Romania 54-10 in front of two men and a dog. Within a decade it was being heralded by no less an authority than the Observer as the greatest rugby tournament. More colourful than regular domestic competitions; more competitive than the World Cup; more teams than the Six Nations or (as was then) the Tri Nations. On the eve of the 10th season, in 2004, our late correspondent Eddie Butler described the competition as a \u201cnew cultural experience\u201d to rival the Six Nations.  The northern hemisphere had just produced its first (and to date only) world champions, and, get this, the cumulative deficit of the nine Premiership clubs who filed accounts that season was a little over \u00a31m. Four of them were in profit. The salary cap was \u00a32m. How times change. As we sit on the eve of the 28th edition, which kicks off on Friday on the shores of the Thames, when London Irish host Montpellier, does anyone feel the same way about the competition that in its heyday not even the most curmudgeonly would flinch at calling by its sponsor\u2019s name? Do we even know what its name is now? Heineken are still sponsors, or at least they returned as such in 2018, after four years away. At some point, presumably to try to jazz things up (and/or copy football), someone introduced the word \u201cChampions\u201d into the nomenclature. This season they have introduced South African teams into the playing roster, which will undoubtedly bring a new dimension, but somewhat makes a mockery of the initialism EPCR, where E stands for European. Then again, maybe Brexit had done that already. In keeping with the times, something feels out of joint with professional rugby\u2019s beloved child, which, to save the reader looking it up, is now officially known as the Heineken Champions Cup. Covid has hit all competitions hard (see the Premiership), but this is the only one to have had a weekend squeezed out of its calendar. In order to accommodate the chaos of the 2020-21 season, the classic six-pool format was abandoned in favour of the unwieldy two pools of 12 that now pertain, to be contested over four weekends. There can be no pools of death in this setup. The format was positioned as a temporary arrangement while the world got back to normal, but here we are preparing for its third season. Having lost two weekends in October in exchange for an extra weekend (a knockout round of 16) in April, a reversion to the previous structure would be a mathematical impossibility as it stands.  Last week, the launch of this season\u2019s iteration took place in a shiny hotel in a woodland near the M25. In keeping with the mandatory hype of these events, EPCR\u2019s chairman, Dominic McKay, performed admirably, but he acknowledged it is not within his gift to reclaim the lost weekend. Bad news, Dom. That means it is never coming back. Worse still, the rumours persist about a world club championship. Given the South Africans now play up here, and more and more of the best players from New Zealand and Australia are taking up contracts here too, that very idea is becoming correspondingly redundant. All the same, talks are now sufficiently advanced that McKay was able to speculate on its likely format. Answer: every four years the Heineken Champions Cup will forgo anything so trivial as its knockout stages, in order to see how a handful of New Zealand teams might compare against the best of Europe. And South Africa. It is true that football has a Club World Cup, but it is difficult to imagine the Champions League accommodating it in such a way. The Heineken/Champions Cup has become as vulnerable as any other institution in rugby\u2019s adopted model of free-market economics. Originally, it was an aberration, a competition run by the unions for the clubs, revenues split six ways, which meant, in effect, the richer leagues (French and English) subsidised the rest.  The shift from Heineken to Champions took place in 2014, when the clubs pulled rank. Now they run the show, with the unions little more than sitting at the table. The South African union is not even that. Until it becomes a partner, we can consider their participation a sort of trial. South Africa is desperate for meaningful competition for its best teams, but then EPCR is desperate for a fillip for its flagship competition. This might be seen as a perfect match. Then again, everyone is desperate in a free-market model, bar the wealthiest. With the recent tribulations of the Premiership, that pretty much equates to the French these days, with honourable mention for the Irish, although this competition is far more important to the latter. The whispers at the launch were that the success or otherwise of the South African experiment will boil down to how the French clubs take to the travel and logistics. The French are in the ascendancy, which is more about the size of their economy and rugby\u2019s place within it than about the comings and goings of great players. They boast the past two Champions Cup winners and six of the past eight semi-finalists. Increasingly, the rugby world is gravitating around them. That includes the competition that for a while was the best in the world. \u2022 This is an extract from our weekly rugby union email, the Breakdown.

                    "body": "Although Blaise Matuidi\u2019s time in MLS with Inter Miami did not provide the desired results on the pitch, his spell in Florida has helped inspire his next step. Matuidi has had an interest in business for a number of years, investing in various tech startups, including alongside the NBA star LeBron James. \u201cWhen I see athletes here in the United States, I think they have something different to European athletes and the difference is that they know about business. They are experts in their own field but they are also very focused in making other things in life, especially business,\u201d says the Frenchman.  \u201cI think in Europe our goals are in sport and we are focused on that. I think there are few players that are open-minded but a lot are focused only on the sport. I understand that, as we are born like that. In the academy, people say: \u2018I have to be focused only on football.\u2019 Here in the United States, it is something different as when sportspeople go to university they go with engineers, people who work with electrics, and they are all together. In Europe when we go to academies, we are only players. I think it is a big difference and that\u2019s when we create Origins.\u201d Origins is planned as a tech investment fund for athletes, including Matuidi\u2019s fellow World Cup winners N\u2019Golo Kante and Olivier Giroud. The athletes aim to pool their financial clout and social media influence to help grow new companies. Matuidi wants to show players they can look outside of sports for opportunities and show they are more than just athletes. Inter Miami co-owner David Beckham is a prime example of a footballer who has moved into the business world. When Matuidi was looking for a new challenge, it was his former Paris Saint-Germain teammate\u2019s new venture, Inter Miami, that came calling for his services, persuading him to leave Europe for the club\u2019s inaugural MLS season in 2020. Matuidi was left off the team\u2019s roster for the 2022 season, despite having a year remaining on his contract, leaving him more time to focus on his business interests. \u201cI played with David in the past at Paris Saint-Germain, not for too long but it was a good time,\u201d Matuidi says. \u201cI was happy because he had had this experience and he helped Paris Saint-Germain a lot. When I heard Inter Miami was interested in signing me, David was a big part of my thinking, so I was happy to join his team because he is an example with his experience, what he did in his great career and now as an owner for me is something special. \u201cOur relationship is good and he\u2019s a good guy, and he wants his team to win. When he says things, he does it. I have big respect for him. He doesn\u2019t speak to the players a lot but when he does you understand his goal and where he wants to go.\u201d Getting Matuidi to move to the MLS at the age of 32 was a coup for Inter Miami in their infancy, especially as he could have stayed in the relative comfort of Europe. \u201cFor me it was a new challenge. In Europe I played a lot of games, I won a lot of titles [three with Juventus and four with PSG] and was thinking that I needed something new for me and my family,\u201d he says. \u201cI decided to move on because my family was my first thought, and then the challenge. I know MLS is not like Europe, not in terms of quality, but for me it was something I wanted to do with this new challenge.\u201d Inter Miami are managed by another former teammate of Beckham\u2019s, Phil Neville. So far, his time in charge has been underwhelming: the club finished 10th and 11th in the Eastern Conference in their first two seasons, missing the playoffs on both occasions. This season has been even worse: they have lost three of their first four games, and have the worst record in the entire league.  Neville\u2019s job is under scrutiny \u2013 and Beckham may be in the awkward position of having to fire his friend \u2013 but the former England defender cannot be blamed entirely for the club\u2019s woes. Inter Miami are in rebuilding mode after the club were fined $2m and had wage sanctions imposed after an investigation found they violated roster designation rules for Matuidi and Andr\u00e9s Reyes. \u201cThere are a lot of young players,\u201d Matuidi says. \u201cIt is never easy when you are a new team, you need time and I think Inter Miami need time. It is not an easy league and you need a team with experience \u2026 If you look at Europe, a team like Manchester City before they won [the Premier League] it took time, as it did with Chelsea. When anyone plays Inter Miami, they want to beat us because we are one of the most popular teams in the league, that is why it is not easy.\u201d In footballing terms, Matuidi\u2019s future is uncertain. Gone are the days when Juventus paid PSG an initial \u20ac20m ($16m) for his services and his ambition of moving to England is long gone. \u201cIn the past I was close to moving to the Premier League, to Arsenal, that was my dream. I played in Italy and France, and a lot of people were saying: \u2018How you play, you need to move to the Premier League.\u2019 Unfortunately, I didn\u2019t, so you never know.\u201d Matuidi will be hoping he does not miss out on any opportunities in his other career."

                    "body": "  4.36am    Here\u2019s Megan Swanick\u2019s full report from tonight\u2019s match at the Estadio Nacional de Costa Rica.      4.14am   Final Concacaf World Cup qualifying standings  28 Canada (goal difference +16)28 Mexico (+9)25 USA (+11)---25 Costa Rica (+5)---21 Panama 11 Jamaica(-10)10 El Salvador(-10)4 Honduras(-a lot) After all that fuss and clamor over Tata Martino\u2019s job, Mexico finished with 28 points. And the four points the USA took from Mexico look pretty good right now, especially after the team dropped points to El Salvador, Jamaica and Panama. The so-called Golden Generation has made it through one of the biggest grinds in the sport. The experience will only help them.  So now they move on to their biggest challenge -- negotiating a collective bargaining agreement that guarantees equal pay with the women. And then the World Cup, assuming immunological and sociopolitical issues don\u2019t infringe on the party. Good night, good morning, and enjoy the rest of your club seasons.      4.02am    David Archibald writes: Bad news: There is no bad news. Costa Rica will easily beat New Zealand. I suppose you were that confident that Italy would beat North Macedonia too? A one off game. Don\u2019t forget, NZ hasn\u2019t lost a game at the WC since 1982. (See I can make stupid comments too :-0) Berklee College of Music football. Still unbeaten. FWIW, I was present when New Zealand\u2019s women earned their first point at the World Cup with a late two-goal comeback against Mexico. The coach of that New Zealand team? John Herdman. He now coaches the top men\u2019s team in Concacaf, even if their equalizer in Panama was taken away by VAR.     3.57am   Full time: Costa Rica 2-0 USA  Give some credit to Costa Rica, which I\u2019ve already predicted will easily beat New Zealand and qualify for the World Cup yet again, but that\u2019s two straight games in which their home mystique, rather than the players, accounted for their win. They\u2019re not better than Canada, whom they beat six days ago, and they were not better than the USA tonight. The narrative forming already is that the USA barely qualified. And that\u2019s basically true. But this team improved through the cycle, arguably outplaying three of their top four opponents (two on the road) in their last three games. Berhalter needs to come up with some better ideas on set pieces, and the goalkeeping job is wide-open. Better to learn that now than later. Oh -- and the US men have qualified for the World Cup.     3.54am    Cameron Parkhurst emails re: Pulisic - \u201cFrom what I observed most of his free kicks and corner kicks were poorly taken tonight. The corners were generally hit too long.\u201d They did at least have Miles Robinson open on a couple of those long corner kicks early, but Costa Rica figured that out eventually, and the rest of the free kicks and corners accomplished nothing.     3.51am    90 min: We\u2019ll have four minutes of stoppage time. So if Costa Rica can score one goal per minute ...     3.49am    88 min: I think we can agree the USA is about to qualify for the World Cup unless the referee decides to add about 30 minutes of stoppage time.     3.49am    86 min: De la Torre springs free and puts in a tame effort. Costa Rica races the other way, and Martinez gets just enough space to put in a decent shot. Steffen gets the save. Canada now tied with Panama.     3.45am    84 min: And that\u2019s all for Pulisic. Jordan Morris is in. Good performance from the Chelsea man aside from the set pieces.     3.43am    81 min: \u201cUS in search of a consolation goal,\u201d our commentators say. Let\u2019s get this straight. Costa Rica getting four goals in barely more than 30 minutes was feasible, but the USA getting two in 10 is impossible?  A goal in the next few minutes is not \u201cconsolation.\u201d It\u2019s a comeback. But the pace has slowed. Both teams may be resigning themselves to their fates.     3.41am    80 min: Also, Jose Ortiz replaces Bennette.     3.40am    78 min: Keylor Navas has come off. Tweaked his leg getting his foot to the ball on that US attack earlier. Esteban Alvarado is the replacement. That\u2019ll improve the odds of the USA getting a deserved result here.     3.39am    77 min: Fair point about dead legs here ...  That said, the USA has been the more active side for the last 20 minutes as much as it has been the whole game. Meanwhile, Keylor Navas has to get attention from the trainers.     3.36am    75 min: Every minute that ticks away reduces the chances of any drama in terms of qualification, but the big takeaway here may be Zach Steffen losing the goalkeeping job:      3.34am    71 min: Or not. The USA maintains possession, Reyna plays Pulisic into space on the left, it\u2019s crossed back to the top of the box, and Musah blasts a shot deflected out for a corner. The corner kick, of course, is squandered. The USA has conceded two goals on set pieces and shown little sign of scoring on their own. Blame a decade of US youth coaching in which working on set pieces was considered bad for development.     3.32am    70 min: Somewhere along the way, Yeltsin Tejeda replaced Waston. Ah, Boris Yeltsin. Simpler times. Free kick coming up that will be squandered.     3.30am    69 min: Foul called on Ferreira for ... standing in Navas\u2019 way. Seems harsh.     3.29am    68 min: Speaking of Pulisic, the USA earns its eighth and ninth corner kicks. Douglas Lopez makes his debut for Costa Rica, replacing Brandon Aguilera. The corner kicks accomplish nothing.     3.28am    Brad Wilson writes: \u201cBeing an USA fan who doesn\u2019t give a damn about Chelsea, rather the opposite, I hope Pulisic plays until his manager deems a substitution advisable, if ever. Poor megaclubs whining about international football ... my heart breaks.\u201d Normally, I\u2019d agree, and I think there\u2019s too much international football. But this is a crowded international window, and Pulisic just has a target on his legs. Forget Chelsea -- US fans also don\u2019t want to see him hurt.     3.27am    66 min: Adrian Martinez replaces Mora. CBS commentators hyping the possibility of Costa Rica daring to dream now. I\u2019m one of the biggest pessimists in the world, and I don\u2019t see it happening.     3.26am    63 min: Finally, a yellow card for a foul on Pulisic, who is still in there. Mora is the unlucky party. Former MLS defender Kendall Waston is down for Costa Rica. OK, at last, those USA subs are ... Gio Reyna for Weah (pity -- I\u2019d love to see them together) Jesus Ferreira for Pepi Shaq Moore for Yedlin, a bit surprising since Yedlin should be fresh after missing the last game.     3.23am    61 min: USA subs ... Several. Our feeds are painfully slow with such news, but I\u2019ll update.     3.22am   GOAL: Costa Rica 2-0 USA (Contreras 59)  Sloppy, sloppy, sloppy. Steffens handles a set piece badly. He saves the follow-up, but the ball bounces clear, and a mishit cross lands on the feet of two Costa Rican attackers kept onside by a defender at the other post. Yeesh.     3.20am    Shocker in Panama ... the home side is up 1-0 on Canada. Sure, the game means little to the group winners, but ...     3.19am    57 min: Navas parries a Pepi shot. That\u2019s six shots on goal for the USA to two for Costa Rica. Safe to say Navas has been the more impressive of the goalkeepers on the field.     3.17am    55 min: USA reasserting control of the game, having given up a goal very much against the run of play. The Costa Rican team and crowd surely know they\u2019re not qualifying tonight, but beating the USA is always a point of pride, hence the long celebration ...      3.13am   GOAL: Costa Rica 1-0 USA (Vargas 51)  Corner kick, man streaking through the box unmarked, header, goal. Getting five more still seems unlikely, but the USA\u2019s chances of breaking their losing streak in Costa Rica just took a hit.     3.10am    48 min: CHANCES for the USA. Free kick finds Miles Robinson, whose header forces a good leaping save from Navas. Weah can\u2019t quite get enough on his shot to poke it through, but the danger still isn\u2019t cleared until Zimmerman puts his shot over the bar.     3.09am    46 min: Luca de la Torre, who made a good impression against Panama, has replaced Tyler Adams, who shook off an early injury but probably doesn\u2019t need to take any more chances now. Costa Rica fouls ... Pulisic. You guessed it. This is why persistent infringement exists in the Laws.     2.59am    Big day for women\u2019s football Two momentous occasions to celebrate: 1. 91,553 people went to the Camp Nou to see Barcelona beat Real Madrid 5-2 for an 8-3 aggregate win in the Champions League. 2. The Guardian has a new newsletter.  Sign up for our new and free women\u2019s football newsletter      2.58am    The doors keeps closing for Costa Rica ... Mexico\u2019s now up 2-0 on El Salvador. Jamaica is up 2-1 at home against Honduras in a matchup of the bottom two in the eight-team group. The most surprising halftime score on paper is 0-0 in Panama, but the hosts have been eliminated and visiting Canada will win the group.     2.52am   Halftime: Costa Rica 0-0 USA  Somehow, I don\u2019t think Costa Rica is going to get six goals. The visitors have actually looked like the more likely team to score.      2.50am    44 min: Another USA corner kick.      2.48am    42 min: On the question of when to sit Pulisic -- there\u2019s no need to worry about yellow-card accumulation, per World Cup regulations:    Single yellow cards and pending suspensions as a consequence of cautions received in different matches in the preliminary competition of the FIFA World Cup 2022\u2122 are not carried over to the final competition. Pending match suspensions imposed as a result of a direct or an indirect red card in matches in the preliminary competition of the FIFA World Cup 2022\u2122 are carried over to the final competition.   Meanwhile, for the sake of variety, Costa Rica fouls Weah rather than Pulisic.     2.46am    40 min: Steffen is called into action again to punch a Costa Rican corner clear. If you\u2019re wondering if the fact that we can hear US coach Gregg Berhalter yelling from the bench is a sign of the home crowd going quiet or Berhalter just being that loud, the answer is yes.     2.44am    38 min: While we\u2019re in a lull in what has been a better game than expected, vote in my poll, won\u2019t you?      2.42am    35 min: Costa Rica finally gets a shot on goal, with Brandon Aguilera letting one rip from outside the box, but Steffen isn\u2019t troubled.     2.39am    33 min: Yedlin somehow beats his man on the right and fires in a cross. Turns out the ref was playing advantage, because Costa Rica fouled, you guessed it, Christian Pulisic. Chelsea management must hate these games.     2.37am    30 min: Some danger now, with Bennette controlling the ball on the left flank and unleashing a decent cross. The USA regains possession, and Antonee Robinson shanks a cross ... toward the far upper corner of the goal, where Navas has to tap it over for another corner kick. This one yields another strong shot, but it doesn\u2019t get through the traffic, just like DC drivers dealing with the truckers\u2019 convoy. Or DC drivers every other day.     2.34am    27 min: Jedi Robinson takes off to lead a USA counter. Costa Rica is gambling with this press, but they have to. Speaking of presses -- stop the presses. Christian Pulisic has been fouled.     2.32am    25 min: Extended possession for Costa Rica now. Obviously, I spoke too soon. But the ball floats into the area, and a header arcs up into the sky before falling into Steffen\u2019s arms. Here\u2019s your Mexico goal:  And here\u2019s a not-goal in Costa Rica:       2.29am    22 min: Another corner kick, and it once again finds Miles Robinson. His header sails well over the ball. Tyler Adams, apparently feeling a bit better, breaks up a Costa Rica attack. Has the USA had a better quarter of a game in Costa Rica in the last, I don\u2019t know, 10 years? 20? Ever?     2.27am    20 min: GOOOOOOOOAAALL ... ... in Mexico. 1-0 for the home side, further damaging Costa Rica\u2019s second unlikely path to qualification tonight.     2.25am    19 min: Eat my shorts ...  So far, the USA is coping well with the Costa Rica press. Will that change as fatigue from a busy international window sets in?     2.24am    17 min: Musah is tripped ... well, no, he\u2019s not, but the ref thought he was ... about 25 yards out, and it\u2019s a free kick. Acosta takes it despite the presence of Pulisic, and it slams into the wall.     2.21am    15 min: Your score updates from other Concacaf games: 0-0, 0-0, 0-0. Like the old joke says -- \u201cI can tell you the score of any game before it starts.\u201d     2.19am    13 min: CHANCE and it\u2019s Weah setting things up again, springing Pepi in the box. It\u2019s an acute angle, but Pepi forces Navas to make another save. And it\u2019s another corner kick.     2.17am    10 min: The first significant Costa Rica attack yields a corner kick. Zimmerman clears. A follow-up shot zips just over the bar. Now Costa Rica unleashes a vicious press. Could be a great counterattacking opportunity if the USA can create some space.     2.14am    8 min: CHANCE for the USA, and that stung Navas\u2019 hands. The corner kick sails over the crowd to Miles Robinson, who has a little bit of time to settle the ball and rip a scorching ball on target. Navas spills it toward the goal but has plenty of time to collect. If you believe the best defense is a strong offense -- first of all, you\u2019re right, and second of all, you\u2019re happy so far. (If you\u2019re rooting for the USA.)     2.13am    7 min: Tim Weah gets his first meaningful touches, and he already looks dangerous. Hard to believe the USA racked up five goals without him. Corner kick now.     2.12am    6 min: Some bad news for the USA now -- Tyler Adams, the midfield engine, is moving around in some discomfort. Possible subs are warming up.     2.11am    4 min: Make it two shots on goal from the USA, though neither has particularly troubled the longtime Real Madrid goalkeeper. This one is a Miles Robinson header off a Pulisic corner.     2.09am    2 min: A half-chance for the USA, with a cross from \u201cJedi\u201d Robinson (sometimes called Antonee) catching Ricardo Pepi in a tight space in the area, and his shot is lobbed into the air and caught by Navas.     2.07am    Yes, we\u2019ll keep an eye on the Mexico-El Salvador game just in case the unthinkable happens and Costa Rica can advance ahead of Mexico. Kickoff in Costa Rica, where the crowd doesn\u2019t seem to realize their team more or less conceded direct qualification already. But they may still get a result, which they would surely celebrate.     2.03am    National anthems ... Lots of whistling during the USA anthem. Costa Rica\u2019s team could use some singing lessons. And now ... fireworks.     1.41am    Further underscoring the B-team feel of the Costa Rica lineup:       1.39am   Costa Rica lineup  There\u2019s a hitch here. Nine players are facing yellow-card accumulation-related suspensions, and Costa Rica is very likely to have one more qualifying game. It\u2019s safe to say that affected selection.  So the object appears to be to sit back and see what transpires. If Los Ticos somehow conjure up a few goals, they can toss Bryan Ruiz and Joel Campbell into the mix. If not, well, with no major players suspended, they can take care of New Zealand. Lineup ... Goalkeeper: Keylor Navas (Paris Saint-Germain) Defenders: Ian Lawrence (Alajuelense), Juan Pablo Vargas (Millonarios), Kendall Waston (Saprissa), Daniel Chacon (Cartagines), Carlos Martinez (San Carlos) Midfielders: Brandon Aguilera (Alajuelense), Orlando Galo (Herediano), Jewison Bennette (Herediano), Carlos Mora (Alajuelense) Forward: Anthony Contreras (Guanacasteca)       1.20am   USA lineup  This is no B team. It\u2019s arguably better than the starting XI that beat Panama 5-1, thanks in part to the return of DeAndre Yedlin and Tim Weah. The captain is an interesting choice -- not Christian Pulisic or Tyler Adams but Walker Zimmerman. Starters ... Goalkeeper: Zack Steffen (Manchester City) Defenders: DeAndre Yedlin (Inter Miami), Walker Zimmerman (Nashville SC), Miles Robinson (Atlanta United), Antonee Robinson (Fulham) Midfielders: Kellyn Acosta (LAFC), Tyler Adams (RB Leipzig), Yunus Musah (Valencia)  Forwards: Ricardo Pepi (Augsburg), Christian Pulisic (Chelsea), Tim Weah (Lille)     1.12am   Preamble  Let\u2019s look at this game from Costa Rica\u2019s point of view ... Good news: This game is in Costa Rica, where the home team has beaten the USA in 1996, 1997, 2000, 2001, 2005, 2009, 2013 and 2016. Bad news: Costa Rica needs to beat the USA by six goals. Good news: Costa Rica beat the USA 4-0 in 2016. Bad news: J\u00fcrgen Klinsmann is no longer the USA\u2019s coach. That 2016 defeat was one of the last straws. Bad news: Four is still less than six. Bad news: Costa Rica has only scored 11 goals in 13 World Cup qualifiers. (That\u2019s why they\u2019re in this position in the first place.) Good news: Costa Rica can still get in with a win, a Mexico loss and a four-goal swing in goal difference. Bad news: Mexico is playing at home. Against El Salvador. Good news: The fourth-place Concacaf team will face Oceania champion New Zealand in an intercontinental last-chance qualifier. Bad news: There is no bad news. Costa Rica will easily beat New Zealand.     1.00am    Beau will be here shortly. In the meantime, here\u2019s how the US got on against Panama:  With all due respect to the Disney marketing department, the most magical place on the planet was a few miles northeast of Orlando\u2019s theme parks on Sunday night. That\u2019s how Exploria Stadium must have felt to the US and their exuberant fans, at least, as a Christian Pulisic hat-trick helped deliver a 5-1 thrashing that hoisted Gregg Berhalter\u2019s men to the brink of Qatar 2022. A tricky and occasionally torturous qualifying campaign is now all but certain to enjoy a happy ending. Of course, the US know from agonising experience that weird things can happen on the final night of Concacaf qualifying, after an easy win over Panama at the home of Orlando City. But in all probability this will not be a case of history repeating. Unlike in 2017, the US can afford a loss in their final fixture, away to Costa Rica on Wednesday. In fact, they can afford a big loss. Even a five-goal defeat would not be fatal given the gap in goal difference between them and Costa Rica in fourth. The result eliminated fifth-placed Panama from contention, meaning that the US can finish no lower than fourth, the rank that entails an intercontinental playoff in Qatar in June, probably against New Zealand.

                    "body": "Lionel Messi celebrated his return to domestic competition after the World Cup by scoring a second-half goal as Paris Saint-Germain extended their Ligue 1 lead to six points with a 2-0 home win against Angers. Messi, who wore a T-shirt honouring Pel\u00e9 when he warmed up, received a strong welcome from the Parc des Princes crowd. He netted from close range in the 72nd minute to add to Hugo Ekitike\u2019s first-half opener, putting PSG on 47 points from 18 games.  Lens stayed second but dropped two points in a 2-2 draw at struggling Strasbourg with all the goals being scored before the break. Third-placed Marseille are now two points adrift of Lens on 39 points after a 2-0 win over Troyes. Ross Barkley scored twice as Nice responded to Lucien Favre\u2019s sacking with a 6-1 thrashing of Montpellier. Arsenal loanee Nicolas P\u00e9p\u00e9 also hit a double. Thibaut Courtois saved Jos\u00e9 Gay\u00e0\u2019s poorly struck spot-kick to give Real Madrid a 4-3 penalty-shootout win over Valencia in their Spanish Super Cup semi-final in Saudi Arabia.  The two teams finished level at 1-1 after 90 minutes and extra time. Karim Benzema gave Real Madrid, the holders, the lead from the spot in the first half after he was fouled inside the area by Eray Comert but Valencia came back into the game and deservedly equalised through a Samuel Lino volley from a Toni Lato cross straight after half-time. Vin\u00edcius J\u00fanior could have won it for Real Madrid in extra time but his close-range shot was saved by Giorgi Mamardashvili. Real Madrid will face the winner of Thursday\u2019s semi-final between Real Betis and Barcelona in the final in Riyadh on Sunday. In Italy, Milan crashed out of the Coppa Italia after a 1-0 home defeat to Torino. Koffi Djidji was shown a red card in the 70th minute but Ndary Adopo struck in extra time for the 10 men."

                    "body": "Dejan Kulusevski is reflecting on his latest life adventure and there is certainly a richness to the back story. A ballsy and controversial move from his native Sweden to Italy before he was 16. Experience in Serie A with Atalanta, Parma and Juventus. An explosive start to his career at Tottenham, where he went in January. A billing as the great hope of the Sweden team, who he hopes to drive to the World Cup finals over the next week and a half. It is hard to believe that Kulusevski is only 21 as he speaks with an easy confidence in English \u2013 one of the four languages in which he is fluent. The others are Swedish, Italian and Macedonian; his family\u2019s roots are in North Macedonia. Kulusevski can understand some German and he is starting to do likewise with Spanish. But there is something else for him now.  Kulusevski can call himself a reality TV star. Maybe that is pushing it a bit. Kulusevski sees Playmakers \u2013 which is made by TV4 in Sweden \u2013 as \u201csomething very small \u2026 it\u2019s not even on television, it\u2019s on an app on the internet\u201d. The show, which entered its fifth series on Thursday, follows women who are together with sporting personalities and lead glamorous lives. But if Kulusevski\u2019s girlfriend, Eldina Ahmic, who has played football at a good level, is one of the principal subjects, it is not as if he is not in it, too. \u201cThey follow her life more,\u201d Kulusevski says, explaining that Eldina shoots the footage on her own phone. \u201cThere\u2019s no cameras. We\u2019d have never done it with cameras. I\u2019m just there maybe acting a little bit funny, sometimes.\u201d Kulusevski mentions a Carpool Karaoke-type scene. \u201cIt was me and my girl singing together in the car, like everybody does \u2026 we love music.\u201d But it is when he is asked whether they were nervous about opening their private lives to the public that his character shines through. \u201cShe was nervous, absolutely,\u201d Kulusevski says. \u201cMe less. Because I know for some years that everything I do comes out in a way or another. Yeah, you have to be very careful with what you show to people because they cannot wait to bring you down. But I am maturing a lot and the more the time goes, the more comfortable I feel in who I am. So here I am. I don\u2019t care what will happen and what I say. I just love being myself.\u201d  Kulusevski came to feel stifled at Juventus. After Max Allegri replaced Andrea Pirlo as the manager last summer, he found that his playing time decreased. \u201cIt was hard,\u201d Kulusevski says. \u201cYou really have to be strong when things are not going the way you think they should be going and there are things you can\u2019t control. It\u2019s very frustrating when you love something and you cannot show it. I knew I needed a change.\u201d Kulusevski looks reborn at Spurs and it is a mark of the impact he has made since his move on an initial 18-month loan from Juventus that the supporters already have a chant for him. \u201cGimme, gimme, gimme a ginger from Sweden,\u201d they sing to the Abba classic. Kulusevski is heavily into his hip-hop so Abba? Really? \u201cThey\u2019re quite good \u2026 I can\u2019t say anything bad about them,\u201d he says, laughing. \u201cI love the chant. All my friends send it to me all the time and think it\u2019s really funny.\u201d  Kulusevski has been energised by the trust that the Spurs manager, Antonio Conte, has placed in him. He gave a powerhouse performance in his first start \u2013 the 3-2 Premier League win at Manchester City, in which he scored one and set up another \u2013 and he has kept his place for the six games that have followed. Conte has used him as the right-sided No 10 in his 3-4-2-1 system and he will count on him again in Sunday\u2019s home derby with West Ham. \u201cIt\u2019s especially the coach and the staff who are helping me a lot, letting me make mistakes and be me, letting me play without pressure,\u201d Kulusevski says. \u201cWhen you are good in your mind, you usually play good football. \u201cAbout my best position, it\u2019s hard to say because football is evolving and I am a guy who cannot stand still and I want to move in big, big spaces. The coach has helped me a lot because I really find my space right now. I like where I\u2019m playing and every game I have had chances to score.\u201d Kulusevski\u2019s football journey was fired when he left his first club, Brommapojkarna or BP \u2013 in the west of Stockholm \u2013 for Atalanta. Considered a prodigy, BP did not want him to go and their director, Ola Danhard, infamously said it was \u201calmost kidnapping\u201d by Atalanta. Kulusevski and his family did not see it that way. They wanted the move, no matter the challenges it would present. \u201cI went when I was 15-and-a-half, without parents \u2026 going to school in a language that I did not understand,\u201d Kulusevski says. \u201cI did a lot of hard things but it helped me a lot. I learned so many new things.\u201d  These days, Kulusevski can learn from one of his heroes \u2013 Zlatan Ibrahimovic, who came out of retirement for Sweden last March. The 40-year-old is in the squad for the World Cup play-offs; Sweden face the Czech Republic on Thursday and, if they win, they will play Poland on Tuesday week for a place at the finals.  Kulusevski talks reverentially about Ibrahimovic, who was born in Sweden to a Bosnian father and Croatian mother. Kulusevski was also born in Sweden, as was his father, Stefan, although his parents were from North Macedonia. Kulusevski\u2019s mother, Katica, was born and raised in North Macedonia, moving to Sweden as an adult. \u201cZlatan opened doors to us people in Sweden that nobody can imagine,\u201d Kulusevski says. \u201cHe really helped every young kid \u2026 kids who were outsiders, showing them that everything is possible. When he started mentioning my name as a player, I was like a kid at Christmas. \u201cFor me and my family, Macedonia is very important. Like my mum says, we will never forget where we come from. I go there every summer and I love it. I\u2019ve always said that if I could play for Sweden and Macedonia I would. But I had to choose and I chose Sweden because I am from there. Now we have the West Ham game and, after that, I will be ready to bring my country to the World Cup. It\u2019s where we belong.\u201d "

                    "body": "Country Grammer provided Frankie Dettori with a fourth success in the Dubai World Cup at Meydan.\nThe winning horse over the dirt was trained by Bob Baffert, who himself collected a fourth World Cup success despite controversy back home in the United States, where he is fighting a series of legal battles over Medina Spirit\u2019s positive post-race test for banned substances when winning last year\u2019s Kentucky Derby.\n\nBaffert has recently lost four Kentucky Derby hopefuls after owners moved them to new trainers to allow them to run in this year\u2019s race on 7 May. The trainer of 2018 Triple Crown winner Justify is banned from his horses competing at Churchill Downs, where the Derby is held.\nHe received that two-year ban last June but is still allowed to compete elsewhere and duly collected another World Cup to follow training the winners of the 1998, 2001 and 2017 winners on Silver Charm, Captain Steve and Arrogate respectively. Medina Spirit himself died of a heart attack while training in Santa Anita last December.\nDettori won his first Dubai showpiece event aboard the great Dubai Millennium in 2000 and on Moon Ballad in 2003 and Electrocutionist in 2006. Having earlier finished in a dead heat with Japanese runner Panthalassa for the Dubai Turf, the Italian\u2019s mount was part of a formidable American World Cup contingent headed by red-hot favourite Life Is Good.\nTodd Pletcher\u2019s Breeders\u2019 Cup Dirt Mile winner had successfully stepped up to nine furlongs in the Pegasus World Cup in January. He got off to his usual fast start and led the field into the home turn, but it was obvious with a furlong to run that the petrol tank was emptying quickly and he faded into fourth.\n\nDettori meanwhile delivered Country Grammer and was well on top at the line, with Hot Rod Charlie staying on strongly to finish second with Japan\u2019s Chuwa Wizard in third.\n\u201cHe\u2019s a big horse and did exactly what I wanted him to do until the half-mile pole when I thought Life Is Good was getting away from me,\u201d said Dettori. \u201cI started trying something different to get him on the right leg, give him some fresh air and fill his lungs. Passing the furlong marker I thought \u2018I\u2019ve won this\u2019. The last furlong was amazing \u2013 such a great feeling.\n\n\u201cLife Is Good is one of the best, but if there was a chink in his armour it was the mile and a quarter. This is an important race, and Dubai has taken up a good chunk of my life. Coming back it was as if I\u2019m part of the furniture.\u201d\nJohan takes the Lincoln for Channon and De Sousa\nJohan made a successful debut for the Mick Channon team with an impressive display in the SBK Lincoln at Doncaster. A six-time winner for William Haggas, the five-year-old switched yards during the off-season and was a 28-1 shot for the traditional Flat season curtain-raiser in the hands of Silvestre de Sousa.\nAlways to to the fore, Johan quickened up to take over the lead from Saleymm deep inside the final furlong and passed the post with a length and a quarter in hand. Saleymm was a clear second, with Rogue Bear making late gains to beat Irish Admiral to third."

                    "body": "It is more than 33 years ago since Neneh Cherry swaggered around the Top of the Pops stage in big white trainers performing Buffalo Stance with the fierce energy of a woman who was having a fine old time and wanted everyone to know about it. Around her neck hung a huge medallion and she wore a golden bustier and matching jacket. But it wasn\u2019t her outfit that was the talking point at secondary school the next day \u2013 but the seven-month pregnancy bump that stuck proudly out of her Lycra miniskirt as she lip-synched along. It was the first time many of us had seen a pregnant woman being, well, visible and certainly the only time we\u2019d seen one looking so sensationally cool. Allegedly, a journalist was daft enough to check with Cherry that it was safe for her to go on stage in her state of pregnancy, to which she sighed: \u201cIt\u2019s not an illness.\u201d  It was footage of the Pakistan captain, Bismah Maroof, holding her six-month-old daughter Fatima at the Women\u2019s World Cup in New Zealand that instantly brought back memories of that Thursday night watching Cherry. Although Maroof was dressed in her pine-green Pakistan tracksuit and had her hair pulled back in a sportswoman\u2019s ponytail, she radiated the same power to inspire change. Seeing female cricketers with their children is not unknown, and there are eight mothers playing in the current World Cup \u2013 Maroof, New Zealand\u2019s Amy Satterthwaite and her wife, Lea Tahuhu, West Indies\u2019 Afy Fletcher, Australia\u2019s Megan Schutt and Rachael Haynes, and Lizelle Lee and Masabata Klaas of South Africa \u2013 but it is practically unheard of on the subcontinent, where marriage and/or childbirth is usually the end for a cricketing career. A fantastic article by Annesha Ghosh in The Cricket Monthly, looking at motherhood and cricket, summarises that only three of the 81 female cricketers contracted by India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh are married. Maroof, then, is an outlier, not only leading her country but showing that motherhood does not have to spell the end to sporting ambition.  Maroof tells Ghosh that even during her own career, some of her teammates have had to give up the game: \u201cBatool [Fatima], Nain [Abidi], Asmavia [Iqbal], Qanita [Jalil] and several others \u2013 they were all Pakistan teammates of mine who either couldn\u2019t resume cricket for a long time after marriage or had to leave it altogether for good.\u201d However, the increased professionalism of the game over the past few years, and Maroof\u2019s own pregnancy, nudged the Pakistan Cricket Board, during Wasim Khan\u2019s spell as chief executive, into a maternity leave policy. This gives women a year\u2019s paid leave (and men a month) plus shared costs of a support person to help with childcare \u2013 in this case Maroof\u2019s mother, who has been seen cuddling Fatima in the stands.  The standout photos of Maroof and her baby came after the World Cup game between India and Pakistan on Sunday, won by India (therefore cementing their 100% record against Pakistan in one-day internationals). In them, members of the Indian team surround Maroof who is holding Fatima, cooing over the altogether cuteness of the baby in her red headband, playing peek-a-boo and trying to get her to look at the camera. The sheer delight shared between the two teams is not something that is usually demonstrated between the Pakistan and Indian men\u2019s teams, whose matches in international tournaments are often hijacked by politicians and fans and turned into some kind of ridiculous proxy war, often ending in violence, either in the stands or on the streets. The lower profile of the women\u2019s matches, and the friendship between the players, has led to a far happier conclusion. \u201cComing back post-pregnancy in six months and playing international cricket is so inspiring,\u201d wrote Smriti Mandhana on Instagram. \u201cBismah Maroof setting an example for sportswomen across the globe. Lots of love to baby Fatima from India and I hope she picks the bat just like you because lefties are special.\u201d Despite the disparity in achievement between the two teams \u2013 India are ranked four and Pakistan eight \u2013 it is actually Pakistan who have taken the lead in franchise cricket, with Ramiz Raja, the Pakistan Cricket Board\u2019s player-chairman, announcing a women\u2019s branch of the Pakistan Super League to be played next year. Meanwhile the BCCI continues to stonewall on the possibility of a women\u2019s Indian Premier League, with the secretary, Jay Shah, saying it would happen \u201csoon\u201d, despite the obvious talent pool of female cricketers and a ready supply of foreign players desperate to be part of the story.  But, in the hours after International Women\u2019s Day, our thoughts should rest most with cricket-loving girls in Afghanistan, where the future of the women\u2019s cricket team is still unclear, and most teenage girls have now gone 173 days without returning to school after the Taliban took over. In November, the Afghanistan Cricket Board\u2019s chair, Mirwais Ashraf, said: \u201cWomen\u2019s cricket is one of the major requirements of the ICC. Therefore it is committed to obtaining it.\u201d However, most of Afghanistan women\u2019s team are believed to have fled the country and on the ACB website there are no photographs of any female players, no details of any upcoming women\u2019s fixtures. In fact, no details on women\u2019s cricket at all. \u2022 This is an extract from the Guardian\u2019s weekly cricket email, The Spin.

                    "body": "Hekmatullah, the rogue Afghan soldier who killed three unarmed Australian diggers in Afghanistan a decade ago, is living in a luxury home in the capital Kabul, treated as a \u201creturning hero\u201d by the Taliban who released him from prison.\nHe has said he does not regret killing Australian soldiers, and has vowed he would again kill Australians, or anyone who opposes the Taliban.\n\u201cIf I am released I will continue killing foreigners,\u201d Hekmatullah told an official of the former Afghan government when his release was being negotiated.\n\u201cI will continue killing Australians and I will kill you as well because you are a puppet of foreigners,\u201d he said.\n\u201cI am among my brothers, we will be free, Afghanistan will be free. We will kill you.\u201d\nSince returning to Afghanistan, Hekmatullah has reportedly been housed in the former diplomatic quarter of Wazir Akbar Khan. He lives in a heavily secured property in a district adjacent to the clandestine former home of Ayman al-Zawahiri, the former al-Qaida leader assassinated eight days ago by a US drone strike as he stood on the balcony of his villa.\n\nHekmatullah\u2019s release from prison in 2020 was fiercely resisted by Australia, with the government previously conceding it did not know where he had been since being freed.\nOf 5,000 prisoners the Taliban wanted released as part of peace deal negotiations with the US, Hekmatullah was one of six terrorists that western governments fiercely resisted being pardoned, because they had either killed unarmed foreign nationals, were unrepentant about their crimes, or had vowed to commit further acts of violent terrorism.\nA former senior official in the democratically elected government of Afghanistan \u2013 overthrown in August 2021 \u2013 has confirmed to the Guardian Hekmatullah\u2019s return to Afghanistan.\n\u201cHe was welcomed back to Kabul as a hero \u2026 with a house, car, guards, an amnesty for his crimes, his expenses are being paid for. He is being treated as a hero.\u201d\nThe Guardian has independently confirmed Hekmatullah\u2019s repatriation to Afghanistan. Family members of the Australian soldiers killed have said they have not been updated on his whereabouts.\nOn 29 August 2012, at Wahab, a patrol base in Afghanistan\u2019s Uruzgan province, Hekmatullah, then an Afghan National Army sergeant, drew his M16 and fired more than 30 rounds from close range at Australian troops. He killed three: L/Cpl Stjepan Milosevic, 40, Spr James Martin, 21, and Pte Robert Poate, 23.\nHekmatullah fled the base into the Baluchi valley and was designated a \u201chigh-value\u201d target for the Australian SAS in Afghanistan within 24 hours. He was the sole target of a controversial SAS mission to the village of Darwan in Uruzgan province on 11 September 2012, based on \u2013 ultimately flawed \u2013 intelligence he was hiding in the village.\nThe mission was the subject of extensive evidence presented during the long-running defamation trial brought by the former SAS corporal Ben Roberts-Smith, who denies all wrongdoing in relation to an allegation he participated in the murder of an Afghan national during that mission.\nTwo other Australian SAS soldiers have also been accused of unlawfully killing Afghan nationals during the raid \u2013 allegations they deny.\nIt was not until February 2013 that Hekmatullah was arrested after being found hiding in Pakistan\u2019s lawless border region. Charged, tried and convicted of three counts of murder, Hekmatullah was sentenced to death, but served only seven years in Bagram prison before being moved to Qatar in 2020, where he lived under house arrest.\nAfter the fall of Kabul to the Taliban, he returned to Afghanistan, where he now lives in Kabul.\nThe senior former government source said he insisted to senior government officials that Hekmatullah not be released, because he presented an ongoing danger, but objections to his release were overruled because of a US desire to conclude its 2020 peace agreement with the Taliban.\n\u201cThe person I met is a dangerous terrorist, a dangerous man,\u201d the source said. \u201cHe is not repentant, not regretful. He is a threat, he can cause harm to the world. He should not have been released.\u201d\nThe source said Hekmatullah appeared to be \u201cvery well protected\u201d, with close links to senior Taliban officials now in government.\n\u201cBut the Taliban who hold the strongest grudges, who want to take revenge, are those who were in prison, including him, Hekmatullah. He has hatred still.\u201d\nThe release of the 5,000 Taliban prisoners was the subject of fierce and fractious debate during negotiations between the US and representatives of the terror networks in Qatar.\nThe US-led Coalition objected to 200 of the prisoners because of the nature of their crimes \u2013 green-on-blue attacks, or attacking civilian targets \u2013 or because they were seen to be ongoing terror threats. Hekmatullah was among the 200.\nAfter further negotiations, the list of objections was reduced to 15: Hekmatullah was still on the list. After still more talks, the list of objections was just six names. Hekmatullah remained still, deemed unsuitable for release.\nIn August 2020, then prime minister Scott Morrison said he spoke directly with then US president Donald Trump, urging that Hekmatullah remain imprisoned.\nHekmatullah, Morrison said, was \u201cresponsible for murdering three Australians and our position is that he should never be released\u201d.\nBut the US overruled Australia\u2019s objections, arguing the release of terrorist prisoners, while unpopular, would lead to a \u201creduction of violence and direct talks resulting in a peace agreement and an end to the war\u201d in Afghanistan.\nAustralia\u2019s department of foreign affairs and trade declined to answer questions on Hekmatullah.\nThe anonymous previous-government source told the Guardian former officials who remain in Afghanistan face the grave threat of retribution from the Taliban.\n\u201cThe Taliban is seeking revenge: they have no mercy. We will be identified soon. Our lives, and the lives of our families, are in danger.\u201d\nHe said the US assassination of al-Zawahiri, the former al-Qaeda leader, had escalated tensions \u2013 and heightened Taliban security fears \u2013 dramatically.\n\n\u201cThe world is definitely putting pressure on the Taliban for appearances. But no matter how much pressure is put on the Taliban, they put pressure on the people.\u201d Those who worked for the former democratically elected government have \u201cbeen left on the battlefield \u2026 as enemies of the Taliban\u201d, he said.\nA Human Rights Watch report this month said Taliban forces had summarily executed or forcibly disappeared more than 100 former police and intelligence officers in four provinces since taking over the country in August 2021, in defiance of a proclaimed amnesty.\n\u201cSummary killings and enforced disappearances have taken place despite the Taliban\u2019s announced amnesty for former government civilian and military officials, and reassurances from the Taliban leadership that they would hold their forces accountable for violations of the amnesty order,\u201d the report said.\n\u201cThe Taliban, through their intelligence operations and access to employment records that the former government left behind, have identified new targets for arrest and execution.\u201d"

                    "body": "Taras Stepanenko was 17 when he made his professional debut for Metalurh Zaporizhzhya, in a 3-1 defeat by Dynamo Kyiv. He was a fine passer of the ball who almost from the beginning read the game with the assurance of a player several years his senior. Great things were expected of him and he seemed on track when he moved to Shakhtar just before his 21st birthday. Twelve years on, though, Stepanenko is still at Shakhtar at the age of 32. He may have won seven Ukrainian Premier League titles and seven Ukrainian Cups but there is a sense of a talent that never quite delivered on its potential. He\u2019s played only 262 minutes in the knockout stage of the Champions League, completed only two knockout matches in the competition, and one of those was a 7-0 defeat to Bayern Munich in 2015.  Perhaps he was never quite the elite talent he appeared to be, somebody who had he been born in England might have come to be celebrated as a great servant of a mid-table Premier League side. But it may also be that he rather plateaued, stuck at a team that dominates domestically without the desire or the opportunity to leave his home country for greater challenges abroad. That is the football way of looking at things. Were these normal times, we would then move on to talking about whether Stepanenko, who demonstrated flickers of his ability at the Euros, might yet have one last job in him, whether he might be able to drive Ukraine to victory over Wales on Sunday and inspire them to their first World Cup since 2006. There would probably have been analysis of how he shut down John McGinn in Wednesday\u2019s World Cup qualifier, restricting the main creative presence in Scotland\u2019s midfield to one key pass and a 60% pass accuracy, while maintaining an 86% pass accuracy himself. And there would have been consideration of how Wales, although they too operate with a back three, structure their midfield differently, so it is harder to isolate one man linking to the forwards. Joe Morrell, who usually plays as the central figure, sits much deeper, with the players flanking him, probably Joe Allen and Harry Wilson although Aaron Ramsey may have a role, pushing on. That might mean Oleksandr Zinchenko having to sit deeper in midfield, rather than occupying the roving left-sided role he did against Scotland and through much of the Euros.  Perhaps there might have been reflections on his personality. Stepanenko has a hinterland. Before going to France for the Euros in 2016, he spoke about how Louis de Fun\u00e8s, an actor and comedian who died in 1983, had shaped his image of the country. He reads a lot, particularly biographies \u2013 Alex Ferguson, Zlatan Ibrahimovic, Napoleon. He admits he has twice started but failed to finish Don Quixote. He knows his wines, favouring dry Italian reds, particularly valpolicella. His wife, Marharyta, is an excellent chef, having studied under H\u00e9ctor Jim\u00e9nez-Bravo. The Spenanenkos love escape rooms \u2013 \u201cThey develop logical thinking, the head starts to work, and they\u2019re a good way to unwind a little\u201d. He is also a devout Christian, which seems to lie behind the scepticism he has expressed about tattoos. \u201cI already remember the names of people close to me,\u201d he said. \u201cI love them, and the addition of a tattoo would not make me love them even more. Besides, I once read that tattoos are pagan symbols. Although our Brazilians [at Shakhtar] all seem to be pious and they stick on both Jesus and the Virgin Mary. So maybe it\u2019s a personal matter.\u201d  If that makes him sound thoughtful and cultured, there is also a volatility. The head-high lunge that earned him a red card against Moldova in 2013 was pretty much as bad as challenges get, although it was probably born of recklessness rather than malice. It should also be said he has only been sent off twice at club level, both for two bookings. One of those came in 2016 for his part in a brawl at the end of a game between Shakhtar and Dynamo. The previous year, Andriy Yarmolenko had committed a dreadful foul on him and although the two exchanged shirts at the end of the game, Yarmolenko then tossed Stepanenko\u2019s to the ground, leading to months of bad blood. But these are not normal times and this is a story with ramifications far beyond football. Stepanenko and Yarmolenko have long since made up and, even if they had not, there would surely have been a sense that a row over a discarded shirt meant little alongside the greater cause for which Ukraine are now fighting.  As Steve Clarke made clear after Scotland\u2019s defeat by Ukraine on Wednesday, all the emotion and all the togetherness in the world does not matter without a tactical plan, and Stepanenko will be key to that, not only for the position he occupies but for his organisational brain. But among the many messages he received after Wednesday\u2019s win, some were from friends fighting on the frontline. The sporting narrative says this could be Stepanenko\u2019s time at last; the real world renders those cliches trite. Doing it for Ukraine has never meant so much."

Nighty night!      8.21pm    Jurgen Klopp\u2019s turn to chat with Sky Sports. \u201cA massive result \u2026 a clean sheet \u2026 two wonderful goals \u2026 space for improvement as well, obviously \u2026 the red card would have been a wonderful goal as well \u2026 against ten men we didn\u2019t react particularly well, we lost our momentum and it was difficult to get back \u2026 Newcastle had nothing to lose any more, a top team with top character \u2026 they threw everything on the pitch \u2026 and we gave them too many set pieces and with set pieces it\u2019s not important how many men you have on the pitch \u2026 if we had scored the third, it would have been it, but we didn\u2019t, and so it was exciting to the end \u2026 the most negative thing is that Darwin has to go off, he has something with his shoulder \u2026 it\u2019s the first clean sheet away from home since April [splutters a laugh] and I can\u2019t believe that \u2026 you need results \u2026 in the end I am really happy we got it over the line, because so many things have happened to us this season \u2026 this time nothing happened, we were not perfect but we were good to win \u2026 we take the result and go from here \u2026 Real Madrid on Tuesday is a tough test but it\u2019s Anfield and I can\u2019t wait!\u201d     8.09pm    Eddie Howe, bravely keeping his chin up, talks to Sky. \u201cA lot happened in the game \u2026 a good start, we created the first chance \u2026 Alisson made a couple of good saves \u2026 then we conceded two goals which is unlike us \u2026 I\u2019m disappointed with them, I\u2019d need to look back on them \u2026 I really feel for Nick Pope, he slightly misjudged the ball \u2026 I suppose technically it is a handball, I don\u2019t know the rules of the red card, it felt like a harsh decision, the player was at an angle with defenders retreating towards our goal, but that was given \u2026 the reaction from the team was brilliant \u2026 we were still in the game, we were competitive, we had chances \u2026 if we could get the third goal we had a route back into the game, but that never came \u2026 we showed with ten against 11 how good we can be \u2026 we were comfortable in our shape and had some threat in transition \u2026 had that goal came the result could have been different \u2026 I back the players to come out of it [their current goalscoring troubles], we have too much quality not to \u2026 both [Loris Karius and Mark Gillespie] have started games away from competitive action, so they\u2019re both match ready \u2026 I have full confidence in both \u2026 we showed that we can be competitive in a different way and overall I am positive going into the cup final \u2026 we need to go into next week with the mindset of protecting our goal, regardless of who is in goal \u2026 we have to look forward to what will be an exciting week for us \u2026 attack the game and try to win.\u201d     7.50pm    The verdict from the managers will be coming soon \u2026 but in the meantime, Louise Taylor\u2019s match report has landed. Here it is!      7.49pm    Allan Saint-Maximin speaks to Sky. \u201cIt is a very bad day \u2026 I feel sad for Nick Pope, because he tried to help the team \u2026 he did everything to help us to be [in the final] so we have to support him \u2026 for sure it\u2019s a bad day \u2026 we played very well, we had the first chance \u2026 after that they scored so it was painful but we kept playing to create more chances \u2026 and then we had that red card \u2026 with ten men we still played very well \u2026 even if Liverpool are not in a top position at the moment, they are still a great team, so to play well with ten men against that team is very good \u2026 I am very disappointed \u2026 we need to think about the final \u2026 I know all the team will fight to be able to win that important game \u2026 the real positive is that even with ten men down against a very big team who play in the Champions League, we play very well \u2026 we created many chances to come back into the game \u2026 I know many teams would not create the chances we created \u2026 so this is positive before we play Manchester United \u2026 I am sure we can cause a lot of problems to Manchester United.\u201d     7.42pm    Trent Alexander-Arnold speaks to Sky \u2026 \u201cThis is a massive one for us \u2026 this was a big one \u2026 we got our win against Everton, which was also massive, but would have meant nothing if we hadn\u2019t backed it up here with another win \u2026 Newcastle are a tough side to beat, but we picked them apart \u2026 the red card settled the game down \u2026 not many teams come here and win so we\u2019re delighted \u2026 they haven\u2019t conceded a lot of goals, so to break them down twice is something not a lot of teams do \u2026 we haven\u2019t had much confidence to be honest, some good performances but no consistent period \u2026 we\u2019re used to going on winning streaks, so we know how to put them together \u2026 it\u2019s starting to feel and look like Liverpool, so there are positive signs \u2026 it\u2019s a great stepping stone for us.\u201d \u2026 and so does Virgil van Dijk. \u201cWe have had results already this season when we\u2019ve felt now is the time to kick on, but this is a little bit different \u2026 coming away from the big win against Everton it was important to keep going \u2026 the red card changed the game a bit for them but also us \u2026 we could have done better, but there is a reason we are the only team to have beaten them \u2026 I am very proud of the boys \u2026 when you play against ten men sloppiness creeps in, you have to try to do the same things, but it is difficult \u2026 we can be proud \u2026 now is time to make the rest of the season as good as possible \u2026 we want to find consistency \u2026 we have to gain confidence in order to gain momentum.\u201d     7.33pm    Jurgen Klopp congratulates his team more in relief than anything else. They\u2019re still not quite firing on all cylinders, yet scored two fine goals in the first 17 minutes, the game effectively won when Nick Pope then received his marching orders on 22. They never quite managed to put the game to bed, though, and a spirited Newcastle kept them working until the very end of an evening that could have major consequences: Liverpool travel home with their top-four hopes boosted, while Pope\u2019s red card throws Newcastle\u2019s League Cup final plans into turmoil. Eddie Howe, in contrast to Klopp, cuts a pensive figure.      7.24pm   FULL TIME: Newcastle United 0-2 Liverpool  Newcastle battled well to limit the damage, all of which was done in the first 22 minutes.     7.23pm    90 min +2: On Sky, Jamie Carragher names Allan Saint-Maximin as his man of the match. The Newcastle forward has indeed been superb in adversity. Before the game, he said he\u2019d \u201ctry to do the best game that is possible\u201d in memory of his old friend Christian Atsu. He\u2019s done that and more.     7.22pm    90 min +1: The first of three added minutes sees Jota round Dubravka on the left but take it a little too wide. He can\u2019t slot from a tight angle, and Salah isn\u2019t able to get on the end of the loose ball. Jota could quite feasibly have scored a four-minute hat-trick there.     7.20pm    90 min: Elliott rolls a pass wide right for Alexander-Arnold, who crosses deep. Jota comes in at the far stick and guides a sensational, delicate header across Dubravka and inches wide of the top-right corner. That would have been a fine goal, from the ridiculous to the sublime. But it\u2019s not to be. Firmino attempts to high-kick home from a very tight angle on the right but can\u2019t connect. Goal kick.     7.19pm    88 min: Liverpool play it short. Elliott then hits long for Van Dijk, who heads back towards Jota in the middle. One from the training ground. Burn heads behind for a corner on the right. From which Jota misses disgracefully, heading a Robertson cross wide left while unmarked, six yards out. He\u2019s been out injured for some time, he\u2019s allowed to be a little rusty.     7.17pm    87 min: Jota\u2019s persistence earns Liverpool a corner down the left. Robertson to take.     7.16pm    86 min: Alisson strides out of his box to deny Saint-Maximin possession. He has indeed been marvellous this evening.     7.14pm    84 min: Saint-Maximin attempts to launch a counter but is denied by a fine last-ditch lunge by Milner, who nicks the ball off his toe. Saint-Maximin stays down, which is another worry for Newcastle ahead of next weekend, but thankfully springs back up again soon enough.     7.13pm    82 min: Firmino plays a loose pass in the centre circle to a dozing Milner. Gordon romps off with the ball. He slips Wilson into the box down the left. Wilson aims for the bottom right, allowing Alisson to kick away. His third huge save of the game. On Sky, Jamie Carragher suggests that, despite it all, Alisson has been Liverpool\u2019s best player. It\u2019s a difficult point to argue with.     7.11pm    81 min: Newcastle clear with ease. Liverpool come again, but Robertson slips as he makes his way down the left. No matter, because Gordon gifts them the ball back. Salah is in space on the edge of the D. He sidefoots lamely straight at Dubravka. A comedy of errors.     7.10pm    80 min: Salah tears down the right and looks for Alexander-Arnold in the middle, but his low cross is turned out for a corner by Ritchie. Alexander-Arnold to take.     7.09pm    79 min: On the touchline, Jurgen Klopp cuts an agitated figure. His team just can\u2019t put this game to bed.     7.08pm    77 min: Ritchie whips in from the left. Van Dijk eyebrows away from danger with Wilson lurking dangerously. Newcastle have been playing with ten men for nearly an hour, but they haven\u2019t once threatened to capitulate. It\u2019s not exactly been ideal, yet in its own way its been very impressive. It all augurs well for days when they\u2019re not behind the eight-ball.     7.06pm    75 min: Robertson, Firmino, Jota and Elliot combine smoothly down the left flank. With a man over in attack, a series of simple passes gets them all the way to the Newcastle box. Robertson has the opportunity to shoot from the penalty spot, but unselfishly lays off to Salah, who is eased off the ball by Botman. That should have been a nerve-settling third for Liverpool. But they overplayed their hand, and Newcastle still have hope.     7.04pm    73 min: Eddie Howe might be planning for next weekend\u2019s final, but his ten men are still scrapping away on the pitch. Liverpool aren\u2019t being given a moment\u2019s peace.     7.01pm    71 min: Joelinton jabbers at Eddie Howe, desperate to stay on and play. But Howe\u2019s not having it. He tells his assistant to \u201cdo it\u201d and up goes the board. As Joelinton is replaced by Ritchie, Howe makes a point of telling the disappointed player that he\u2019s doing it \u201cfor you\u201d. To be fair to Joelinton, there was no tantrum involved; he just wanted to keep going.     7.00pm    69 min: Joelinton goes down with cramp. Looks like he\u2019ll be hooked with next week\u2019s big final in mind. He doesn\u2019t want to leave, though, and wags his finger in the direction of the Toon dugout.     6.59pm    67 min: Gomez channels his inner Beckenbauer, striding down the middle before attempting to release \u2026 Robertson?! \u2026 who is clearly playing out some Gerd Muller fantasies. Robertson-Muller attempts to flick towards the nearby Jota, but the backheel doesn\u2019t come off. All very heady.     6.56pm    66 min: Newcastle aren\u2019t going away, and Longstaff makes his way down the right. He\u2019s skittled by Milner, who is fairly fortunate not to go into the book. Nothing comes of the resulting free kick.     6.55pm    64 min: Wilson, Gordon and Murphy replace Isak, Almiron and Trippier. The former Evertonian Gordon receives a warm reception from his own fans, and the sort of pantomime welcome you\u2019d expect from the away end.     6.53pm    63 min: Robertson is getting plenty of joy down the left. He romps down that flank again. This time his low cross is snaffled by Dubravka. But Newcastle suddenly can\u2019t get out, and Liverpool come again, Jota making ground on the left before flashing a shot-cum-cross through the six-yard box. Nobody in red was taking a gamble. It\u2019d have been an easy tap-in.     6.51pm    61 min: Robertson swings a cross into the Newcastle box from the left. Dubravka should claim, but flaps. Newcastle clear their lines regardless, and Saint-Maximin counters down the inside-left channel before thrashing a wild shot wide and high.     6.50pm    60 min: Liverpool make a quadruple substitution. Gakpo, Nunez, Bajcetic and Henderson make way for Jota, Firmino, Milner and Elliott. Nothing comes of the corner.     6.48pm    58 min: Before the corner can be taken, Nunez goes down holding his shoulder again. A worry for Liverpool ahead of the Champions League tie against Real Madrid next week.     6.47pm    57 min: \u2026 so having said that, Nunez hares down the left, cuts infield, and sends a power curler towards the bottom right. Dubravka sticks out an arm to deny him and turn around the post for a corner.     6.45pm    55 min: Nunez is back up again quickly enough. When play restarts, Alisson and Van Dijk confuse each other as a long ball is played down the Newcastle left. Van Dijk heads behind for a needless corner, from which Schar heads harmlessly wide left. Ten-man Newcastle look most likely to score the next goal.     6.44pm    54 min: Nunez comes off second best in a battle with Trippier down the Liverpool left. Not only will it be a goal kick for Newcastle, Nunez has hurt his shoulder in falling as well. On comes the trainer.   Updated at 6.53pm GMT    6.43pm    53 min: Saint-Maximin hassles Robertson and Van Dijk down the right. He fizzes a low cross into the Liverpool box for Isak, who spins on the penalty spot and aims for the top left. Just over. Had that been on target, I\u2019m not sure Alisson was getting to it. That was too easy for Newcastle, who are still very much in this game, despite it all.     6.41pm    51 min: Liverpool probe hither and yon, attempting to make the pitch as big as possible. But Newcastle hold their shape well. No cracks emerge.     6.40pm    50 min: Saint-Maximin brings the fight to Liverpool down the middle. He enjoys a tussle with Bajcetic and nearly bursts through into space. Not quite, but both players will be proud of their contribution in that no-quarter-given duel.     6.38pm    48 min: Alexander-Arnold makes a nuisance of himself down the right. Joelinton wrestles the ball off him only to blast his clearance straight into Longstaff\u2019s surprised grid. Play stops as Longstaff gathers himself.     6.36pm    46 min: Newcastle know they need the next goal, and come out of the traps flying. Isak nearly benefits from Henderson\u2019s pondering on the edge of his own box. Liverpool eventually clear their lines but that\u2019ll give the hosts succour.     6.35pm    Newcastle get the second half underway. There have been no half-time changes.     6.24pm    Half-time reading.      6.20pm   HALF TIME: Newcastle United 0-2 Liverpool  Liverpool are two goals up. Newcastle are one man down. But the hosts have responded gamely to the early triple whammy they suffered, and aren\u2019t quite out of this yet.     6.18pm    45 min +2: Gomez wedges a fine pass down the inside-right channel for Salah. Had Salah extended a leg, he may have been able to guide the ball past the out-rushing Dubravka. But he opts to attempt to bring it down and round the keeper, and his touch is no good. Goal kick.     6.16pm    45 min: There will be four minutes added to this eventful first half.     6.14pm    43 min: Alexander-Arnold crosses from the right. It\u2019s deflected behind for a corner on the left. Robertson takes. Burn wins another header, but this time it\u2019s a clearing one.     6.13pm    42 min: Newcastle have responded really well to an awful sequence of events. They\u2019ve been the better side since going down to ten men.     6.12pm    41 min: Newcastle probe awhile, then suddenly spring forward through Longstaff, who drives in from the right. He earns a corner off Van Dijk. It\u2019s sent into the mixer. Burn rises highest and crashes a header off the crossbar!     6.10pm    39 min: Salah shapes to send the free kick towards the top left but gets it all wrong.     6.10pm    38 min: \u2026 although that was unfortunate for Newcastle, because Nunez was a yard offside as he combined with Salah. But the flag didn\u2019t go up, and now it\u2019s a free kick, the incident can\u2019t be reviewed. Had it been a penalty, play would have almost certainly been pulled back in Newcastle\u2019s favour.     6.09pm    37 min: One corner leads to another, then Liverpool break upfield again. Salah and Nunez combine down the middle, the former racing towards the right-hand edge of the D. Almiron is forced to take one for the team and foul him. He\u2019s booked.     6.08pm    36 min: Nunez takes a long ball down on the edge of the Newcastle D and is clipped by Schar, but the referee waves play on. Newcastle counter, and Nunez is in the thick of it again, forced to chest out for a corner as Trippier and Longstaff probe.     6.05pm    34 min: Once again, Liverpool calm things down with some measured passing across the back.     6.04pm    32 min: Nothing comes of the corner, but Henderson, formerly of Sunderland and to the amusement of the home crowd, makes a pig\u2019s lug of a simple clearance and the Toon force a repeat corner. Nothing comes of that, either, but that little burst of action proves that Newcastle, for all that they\u2019re up against it, aren\u2019t out of it quite yet.     6.03pm    31 min: Saint-Maximin chases a long pass down the right. He twists Robertson\u2019s blood, before whipping a shot towards the top left. Alisson is required to extend at full length to tip over the bar. His second big save of the game!     6.00pm    29 min: Liverpool stroke it around the back awhile as everyone gathers their thoughts. They\u2019re probably as discombobulated as Newcastle. This sort of thing doesn\u2019t happen every week.     5.59pm    27 min: Incidentally, Dubravka might be Newcastle\u2019s go-to stand-in today, but he won\u2019t be able to deputise for Pope next week at Wembley, having turned out in the League Cup for Manchester United while on loan earlier in the season. Loris Karius to star in his first major showpiece since the 2018 Champions League final?     5.56pm    25 min: Dubravka comes on for the sacrificed Anderson, and immediately makes a big stop, as Alexander-Arnold\u2019s free kick is met by Gakpo, who fires a header straight at the stand-in keeper.     5.55pm    23 min: Pope suffered a proper rush of blood there. The referee had no option. Off he goes \u2013 and what a costly mistake it is, because that means he\u2019ll miss the League Cup final against Manchester United next weekend!     5.54pm   RED CARD! Pope (Newcastle United)  22 min: Alisson claims and instantly launches long. Salah scampers after the long pass from the halfway line! Pope races from his area and stoops to head out of Salah\u2019s path \u2026 only to fall over, then stick an instinctive arm out to smother. The referee flashes red. He\u2019s off!   Updated at 6.05pm GMT    5.52pm    21 min: Anderson cuts in from the left flank and is flipped into the air by Fabinho. It\u2019s another poor challenge by the out-of-sorts Liverpool midfielder, and into the book he goes. Trippier takes the resulting free kick and \u2026     5.50pm    19 min: There\u2019s another check for VAR, this time for offside. But Gakpo was a few inches on. What a pass that was from Salah. What a spin by Bajcetic to start the whole thing off.     5.49pm   GOAL! Newcastle United 0-2 Liverpool (Gakpo 17)  Bajcetic spins gracefully away from Longstaff in midfield and sets Liverpool away on the attack. Fabinho rolls to Salah, 30 yards out, just to the right of centre. Salah chips a pass down a big gap in the middle of the Newcastle defence. Gakpo takes a touch and slots into the bottom right. Another goal that seemed to arrive out of nowhere, in an instant.   Updated at 5.55pm GMT    5.47pm    15 min: Alexander-Arnold looks in the mood, and fires a low diagonal ball into the Newcastle box from the right. Trippier is forced to poke out for a corner with Gakpo lurking. The set piece comes to nothing. Meanwhile here indeed is our old pal Jeff Sax of the Darwin Nunez Appreciation Society, who would like to correct my copy. \u201cThat was not \u2018simple\u2019 for Nunez. First in the last 12 games. A miracle!\u201d He\u2019s not going to let it like, readers, is he.     5.44pm    13 min: That\u2019s taken a bit of air out of the stadium. Newcastle had been the better team in the early exchanges, and that kind of came out of nowhere. \u201cJeff Sax in three, two, one\u2026\u201d chants Joe Pearson.     5.43pm    11 min: There\u2019s a quick VAR check. Did the ball roll down, or brush, Nunez\u2019s arm as he chested down? Nope. He took it down gracefully. That was one heck of a finish. He drove that into the bottom left at 101 mph!   Updated at 5.48pm GMT    5.42pm   GOAL! Newcastle United 0-1 Liverpool (Nunez 10)  Alexander-Arnold picks up possession to the right of the centre circle. He rakes a pass down the middle, where Nunez chests down before slamming past Pope and nearly ripping the net from its moorings. Simple as that. What a finish!   Updated at 5.46pm GMT    5.40pm    9 min: Liverpool take a little of the early sting out of the game with some passing around the back, and then \u2026     5.39pm    7 min: Nunez probes down the left. He cuts back in the direction of Salah but the ball doesn\u2019t get through and Anderson intercepts. Both teams look in the mood to attack; it may well be the best form of defence for the visitors, who have lost their last three Premier League matches on the road.     5.36pm    5 min: Newcastle have started strongly and Saint-Maximin bursts his way past Alexander-Arnold down the left. He shoots from a tight angle. Van Dijk heads the ball back to him. Saint-Maximin shanks a snapshot out for a goal kick. Liverpool do not look secure at the back.     5.35pm    4 min: Saint-Maximin barrels down the left and cuts infield. He finds Almiron in an absurd amount of space just to the right of the D. Almiron is one on one with Alisson. He tries to force the ball past Alisson but the keeper sticks out a strong arm to parry and claim.   Updated at 5.40pm GMT    5.34pm    3 min: Trippier rolls a clever pass down the inside-right channel and nearly releases Isak. Van Dijk snoozing a bit. He\u2019s fortunate that Alisson has read the danger and races off his line to smother.     5.33pm    1 min: Saint-Maximin and Isak combine down the left. The latter crosses. Robertson extends a leg to clear. The ball bounds down the Liverpool left and Nunez hares after it. He\u2019d be free, as well, had Pope not raced miles out of his box to blooter clear. A fast start that promises much.     5.31pm    Everyone takes the knee \u2013 there\u2019s no room for racism \u2013 and then Liverpool get the ball rolling. \u201cWhen Atsu was with Newcastle and he came on as a sub, I recall reacting to the announcement of his name with, \u2018Bless you!\u2019,\u201d writes Peter Oh. \u201cNow, for different reasons, I say \u2018Godspeed and bless you Christian\u2019, and the same to his family and friends, in their time of grief.\u201d     5.30pm    A warm ovation and moment of solemn reflection in memory of poor Christian Atsu. The away fans sing You\u2019ll Never Walk Alone. A small crumb of comfort that his very last act on a football field was beautiful.       5.27pm    The teams are out! Newcastle in their famous black and white stripes, Liverpool in their storied red. A sensational \u2013 and indeed emotional \u2013 atmosphere at St James\u2019 Park. We\u2019ll be off in a couple of minutes.     5.24pm    A reminder of what happened when these teams met at Anfield early in the season. It remains Newcastle\u2019s last league defeat, indeed their only one of the campaign so far.      5.22pm    Jurgen Klopp speaks to Sky. \u201cThey say we are in a fight for a potential Champions League place but I\u2019m just not there yet that I can announce it, we have to show consistency \u2026 we cannot just win one game and everything is good again \u2026 Newcastle is in that spot and if we can decrease the distance that is always helpful and that is what we will try today.\u201d     5.21pm    In addition to Atsu\u2019s passing, it\u2019s also the 90th anniversary of the birth of the legendary Sir Bobby Robson, and Eddie Howe tells Sky: \u201cIt will be an emotional game \u2026 the crowd will certainly show that before the game in different ways \u2026 for the players it\u2019s a case of concentrating on the performance \u2026 they can\u2019t get swept up in that emotion \u2026 I hope we can be the best version of ourselves that we can be \u2026 we have to use any emotion from the crowd in a positive way.\u201d     5.15pm    This morning\u2019s news of the death of former Newcastle player Christian Atsu has hit hard. Sky Sports have spoken to some of the folk who worked with, knew and loved him. Rafael Benitez, who managed him at Newcastle: \u201cI am really sad \u2026 they said he was fine but it was not true \u2026 he was a nice, nice, special person \u2026 a good professional, a very good professional \u2026 but I don\u2019t talk about if he\u2019s a good player or not, he was a nice lad, a good player, but especially a really nice person, a special person \u2026 you can see the pictures always with a smile \u2026 it\u2019s really sad for him and everyone involved because it is really tragic news \u2026 I was in contact with him last month, we were sharing messages \u2026 it is very bad for me to express in English but I was trying to contact him \u2026 also I don\u2019t want to forget the rest of the people, it is a really difficult time \u2026 but we have to remember Christian.\u201d Eddie Howe, who took him on loan at Bournemouth: \u201cIt\u2019s a real tragedy \u2026 I woke up to the news and was truly devastated \u2026 a lot of players in our dressing room worked with him for a couple of years \u2026 we\u2019ll play tribute to him with a minute\u2019s silence and our thoughts are with him \u2026 we give him our thoughts and prayers to his family.\u201d Allan Saint-Maximin, who played with him at Newcastle: \u201cIt\u2019s a very sad day for Newcastle and most of the players because all of the players know him well \u2026 he was a great guy \u2026 I would have a conversation with him and a very nice time with him \u2026 to see this is very painful \u2026 it is difficult to talk about but I will never forget him and will fight for him \u2026 I\u2019m not going to lie, I will tell you the truth, I never seen a guy like that before, when I just arrived in Newcastle, even if we played the same position, he was always giving me some advice, always a very very nice guy \u2026 he was always talking and smiling even when he didn\u2019t play \u2026 he was always a great person \u2026 it\u2019s a difficult day for me but will try to do the best game that is possible.\u201d      4.39pm    Newcastle make one change to the team sent out for the 1-1 draw at Bournemouth this time last week. Elliott Anderson replaces the injured Joe Willock in midfield. Callum Wilson is back after a hamstring injury, starting on the bench. Liverpool also make just the one change after the 2-0 win over Everton on Monday night. Virgil van Dijk returns from his hamstring injury and takes the place of Joel Matip at the back.     4.32pm   The teams  Newcastle United: Pope, Trippier, Schar, Botman, Burn, Longstaff, Joelinton, Anderson, Almiron, Saint-Maximin, Isak.Subs: Dubravka, Dummett, Lascelles, Gorson, Wilson, Ritchie, Lewis, Manquillo, Murphy. Liverpool: Alisson, Alexander-Arnold, Gomez, Van Dijk, Robertson, Fabinho, Bajcetic, Henderson, Nunez, Salah, Gakpo.Subs: Kelleher, Milner, Keita, Firmino, Elliott, Jota, Tsimikas, Matip, Phillips.    Updated at 4.36pm GMT    4.30pm   Preamble  This is a difficult one to call. Newcastle United are making a serious bid for a place in next season\u2019s Champions League; Liverpool have been broadly awful this season. Newcastle haven\u2019t been beaten in the Premier League since August; Liverpool have already been comprehensively defeated three times in the league since the turn of the calendar year. Newcastle are fourth; Liverpool are nine points adrift of them in ninth. Ah but. Newcastle have been struggling to find the net recently, with just three goals in their last six Premier League games; Liverpool rediscovered their attacking verve against Everton last Monday. Newcastle haven\u2019t beaten Liverpool in 12 Premier League games since 2015; Jurgen Klopp\u2019s side are unbeaten in five league games at St James\u2019 Park. Newcastle are without their suspended talisman Bruno Guimaraes; Liverpool were the last side to defeat them in the Premier League. So you can make a case for both teams. That\u2019s why we love football, huh. Kick off is at 5.30pm GMT. It\u2019s on!  "

                    "body": "Manchester City are considering signing Paul Pogba on a free transfer when the Frenchman\u2019s deal expires at rivals Manchester United in the summer. The Guardian understands Pogba is open to crossing the city. Pogba is interested in working with the Manchester City head coach, Pep Guardiola, who believes the World Cup-winner could operate in a deeper role in midfield. It would be a controversial move, following in the footsteps of Carlos Tevez by leaving United for City, and would mean Pogba accepting lower wages than he is currently on.  City cannot make an official approach to Pogba until the end of the season, but the Guardian understands they are willing to offer the Frenchman a four-year contract, with the option of a further year. Academy graduate Pogba, 29, will not extend his contract at Old Trafford with the club he rejoined from Juventus for \u00a389m in 2016. The midfielder has struggled to make the desired impact at Manchester United, scoring 29 times in 154 league appearances across six seasons during which he has won one League Cup and Europa League. The club offered him a new deal last summer, which was rejected, and they have not been back with another. Pogba shared an agent, prior to Mino Raiola\u2019s death, with Erling Haaland who, the Guardian understands, will join City from Borussia Dortmund in the summer. City will pay the striker\u2019s release clause and terms have been agreed with the Norwegian, whose father Alf-Inge had a spell with City at the start of the century. City are set to lose one central midfielder this summer with the veteran Brazilian Fernandinho announcing he will leave to return to Brazil to carry on his playing career, leaving the squad light in that position. It is rare a player of Pogba\u2019s pedigree and commercial value comes on the market for nothing. Few would be able to afford Pogba\u2019s wages \u2013 he is currently earning a reported \u00a3290,000 a week at Old Trafford \u2013 so he could be left with few options in the summer. Paris Saint-Germain are thought to be interested, while Real Madrid have tried to sign him in the past. Pogba is likely to have played his last game for United after limping off during their defeat against Liverpool earlier this month with a calf injury."

                    "body": "If he\u2019s being honest, Sergio \u2018Checo\u2019 P\u00e9rez doesn\u2019t like the comparison. The veteran Formula One driver doesn\u2019t like to be held up against other prominent Mexican athletes, who \u2013 with the exception of him \u2013 have largely disappointed this year. \u201cYou have to give credit to the athletes who try, who get up every morning whether or not the results come in at the end of the day,\u201d P\u00e9rez recently said in Spanish. \u201cBut I think as Mexicans, we have to rid ourselves of the idea of who is better, who is worse, and always looking to pit Mexican athletes against each other.\u201d Nonetheless, he grasps that sports fans in his home country of 129m \u2013 eternally grappling with sometimes incomprehensible levels of poverty, violence and gubernatorial corruption \u2013 see him as perhaps their best hope to deliver whatever competitive glory may come in 2022.  Mexican boxer Saul \u2018Canelo\u2019 Alvarez fell off the top of his sport\u2019s pound-for-pound rankings after losing a decision to Dmitry Bivol in the light heavyweight division amid celebrations of Cinco de Mayo, which commemorates a famous victory over a French army in 1862. Despite securing a berth for the upcoming Fifa World Cup in Qatar, the men\u2019s national soccer team failed to defeat continental rivals USA or Canada during qualifying, putting into doubt whether the squad can hang with the global elite. And the men\u2019s U-20s failed to qualify for that age category\u2019s world championship, shaking confidence that there\u2019s youthful prospects waiting in the wings to return Mexico to regional \u2013 let alone international \u2013 prominence. Yet P\u00e9rez, 32, has interrupted the steady drumbeat of underachievement. In his second season with Red Bull Racing, he secured his first-ever pole position at the Saudi Arabian Grand Prix before picking up his third victory in F1 by topping the field at the legendary street circuit of Monaco. Video clips of his post-Monaco celebration \u2013 dancing on an opulent yacht with his arms around the waist of a blonde Ukrainian fashion model who was not his wife, before stumbling around as he disembarked the boat \u2013 spurred a tabloid controversy. He felt compelled to issue a public apology to his wife and fans acknowledging \u201ca bad party that [he] didn\u2019t know how to control\u201d, somewhat dampening news that Red Bull had chosen to extend him as reigning F1 champion Max Verstappen\u2019s teammate through 2024. P\u00e9rez, however, bounced back. He finished second only to Verstappen at the following race in Azerbaijan, securing his fifth podium of the season and helping Red Bull gash open an 80-point lead in the constructors\u2019 championship over second-place Ferrari. Mechanical problems then prevented him from finishing at the Canadian Grand Prix, but he was preparing to enter Sunday\u2019s race at England\u2019s mythical Silverstone circuit trailing only Verstappen in the world driver\u2019s championship. Verstappen\u2019s 46-point lead over P\u00e9rez is commanding, and pundits doubt Red Bull would really allow P\u00e9rez to jeopardize his Dutch teammate\u2019s bid at a second title. But publicly at least, team chief Christian Horner has said it doesn\u2019t matter which of his drivers clinches the individual championship as long as he\u2019s in a Red Bull car and the team can wrest away the team title from Mercedes, winners the last eight years running.  P\u00e9rez told the Guardian he\u2019s proceeding as if Horner\u2019s words were genuine \u2013 and believes they are. \u201cBoth championships are very important to me,\u201d said P\u00e9rez, whose team hasn\u2019t won a constructors\u2019 title since its fourth consecutive one in 2013. \u201cAnd we\u2019re in a great position for both right now, even if it\u2019s important to remember the season is long and everything can change so fast.\u201d Whatever happens, P\u00e9rez realizes even that tenuous spot was never guaranteed. He still remembers the restlessness that came when he was in the midst of setting the record for most F1 starts without a win: 190, during the first 10 seasons of his career. He finally snapped that ignominious streak late in the 2020 campaign, winning for Racing Point at the Sakhir Grand Prix, which that season\u2019s champion Lewis Hamilton missed due to illness and after P\u00e9rez dropped to last after an early crash that knocked out two drivers. \u201cI just knew it was important not to quit, to keep working, to keep looking for that big team that would give me the chance,\u201d P\u00e9rez said. Red Bull was that big team, pairing him with Verstappen in 2021 in the only car that could fight with Mercedes each round, after a series of drivers couldn\u2019t cut it as the team\u2019s No 2.  P\u00e9rez, in part, responded by winning his second F1 race at Baku in just his sixth outing with Red Bull, along with four other podium finishes. Another highlight that is almost certain to stand the test of time was his erasing of a seven-second gap between Verstappen and Hamilton in the campaign\u2019s finale in Abu Dhabi, which was key in positioning the former to pass the latter during the race\u2019s controversial, championship-deciding last lap. He said he\u2019s proud of what he\u2019s accomplished in surpassing the late Pedro Rodriguez as Mexico\u2019s winningest F1 driver. He said dreams of becoming the first Mexican to win his country\u2019s Grand Prix this fall \u2013 after finishing third there last year \u2013 burn brighter than ever. P\u00e9rez is quick to note that he\u2019s not the only racecar driver from Mexico to be etching a name for himself in autosport. He said he\u2019s relished each of Patricio \u2018Pato\u2019 O\u2019Ward\u2019s wins for Arrow McLaren in IndyCar, along with his second-place finish at the famed Indianapolis 500 on the same day P\u00e9rez ensured the notes of their national anthem blared in Monaco. He said he did the same when Mexican-born Nascar driver Danny Suarez scored his maiden victory at Sonoma on 12 June \u2013 on the same day their countryman Roberto Gonz\u00e1lez helped Jota Sport top the LMP2 class at the 24 Hours of Le Mans endurance race. But P\u00e9rez knows F1 is the peak of his profession. And for now, he knows only he can determine whether or not his sports-obsessed home country can savor a constructors\u2019 championship or \u2013 why not? \u2013 a driver\u2019s title. \u201cIt\u2019s a grand responsibility,\u201d P\u00e9rez said. \u201cBut it\u2019s very special to be representing your country to the world at the highest level.\u201d Note: P\u00e9rez finished second at the British Grand Prix on 3 July 2022, earning his sixth podium of the season."

                    "body": "Few players from the lower reaches of English football ever make it into the national consciousness, let alone stay there for decades. Yet Ronnie Radford, who never played at any level higher than the old Fourth Division, did just that. Radford, who has died aged 79, earned his enduring fame on a muddy pitch at non-league Hereford United in February 1972 during a televised third round FA Cup replay match against First Division Newcastle. The tie seemed to be all over when the visitors went 1-0 up with 10 minutes to play. But shortly afterwards Radford won a sturdy tackle just inside the opposition half, played a long-range one-two with the winger Brian Owen and then unleashed a wondrous shot from 30 yards that rocketed into the top corner of the Newcastle goal. As Radford arced across the sodden surface with arms aloft, hundreds of youthful Hereford pitch invaders engulfed him in a scene of such delirious ecstasy that it has become as much a part of the folklore of the FA Cup as the white horse at Wembley or long-haired Charlie George lying on his back after scoring the winner in the 1971 final.  Radford\u2019s glorious strike allowed Hereford to essay one of the greatest ever cup giant-killing feats with a 2-1 win that was sealed by a goal from Ricky George in extra time. Highlights of the drama were relayed to millions on Match of the Day, with suitably excitable commentary from a young John Motson. Radford\u2019s goal has since been replayed hundreds of thousands of times by misty-eyed admirers. The player himself, a journeyman who spent most of his career in part-time non-league football while working as a joiner, was among those playback enthusiasts who could relive the moment endlessly without becoming bored. But he was typically modest about what has often been described as the best ever goal in the FA Cup. \u201cAt the time I didn\u2019t even think about the distance to the goal,\u201d he recalled. \u201cI just thought: \u2018I\u2019ve got to hit this.\u2019 It could have gone in the car park, but it didn\u2019t.\u201d  Radford was born in South Elmsall, a small coal mining town in Yorkshire. He played at school as a midfielder, a position he occupied for most of his career, although he also appeared at full back. Signed up by First Division Sheffield Wednesday in 1961 as a teenager, he was moved on in the same year to Second Division Leeds, where he trained under their player-manager Don Revie. Having failed to make the first team either at Leeds or Wednesday, in 1962 he was signed up by non-league Cheltenham, where he had a happy time for the next three years on a weekly wage of \u00a312 that was supplemented by joinery work. There was a short interlude with Rugby Town in 1965, but he soon returned to Cheltenham, spending another three seasons there and clocking up 318 appearances until Fourth Division Newport County signed him for \u00a31,500, giving him his first experience of higher-level football. \u201cIt was quicker in the Football League, but my fitness levels improved with full-time training and it was a good experience,\u201d he said later. However, Radford was still living in Cheltenham with his wife Annie, found the travelling to Wales onerous, and also missed his work as a joiner, which he regarded as his main activity. After two seasons at Newport, during which he appeared 68 times, he plumped in 1971 for a transfer to part-time Hereford, allowing him to be nearer home and to pick up with his joinery again. \u201cI left Newport because of the travelling really, and I was earning less in full-time football than I was playing part-time and working,\u201d he said. Although he could never have imagined it, the switch to Hereford also quickly thrust Radford into the spotlight. He was barely into his sojourn there when the club went on a terrific FA Cup run, progressing all the way from the qualifying rounds to within theoretical breathing distance of the final at Wembley. Although the momentous win against Newcastle came as a result of a fine team performance, inevitably Radford\u2019s extraordinary goal \u2013 and the heartwarming scenes that followed it \u2013 stole the limelight.  At the time he had never seen himself on the small screen. \u201cAfter the match, me and Annie stopped off for fish and chips and ate it in front of Match of the Day,\u201d he said. \u201cWe thought it was going to be two minutes of highlights but they made it into the main game. I\u2019d never watched myself play football, I didn\u2019t even know what it looked like when I ran. It was such a strange experience.\u201d Although he was flattered to be the centre of attention, Radford was also discomfited by being the focus of so much media activity. \u201cI was only one part of it, one kick. There were 14 other guys who shared all those experiences with the people of Hereford. I just felt so uncomfortable about being singled out.\u201d After the win against Newcastle, Hereford lost in the fourth round of the cup to West Ham, but were subsequently promoted to the football league. Radford stayed at the club until 1974, after which he had a short spell as player-manager at Worcester City and then played for Bath City, where an achilles tendon injury ended his career at the age of 33. A finish to serious football prompted a return to his native Yorkshire, where he settled in Wakefield with Annie and their two children, Gary and David. Taking up joinery full-tme, he remained there for the rest of his life. Each year, as a reminder of his enduring place in public folk memory, Radford was invited to the FA Cup final to present an award to the team that had pulled off the most inspiring giant-killing act in that year\u2019s competition. He is survived by Annie and their sons.  \u2022 Ronald Radford, footballer, born 12 July 1943; died 2 November 2022"

The first is the President\u2019s Award, which will go to a former player or manager whose achievements on and/or off the pitch have helped to develop the match. Uefa president Aleksander Ceferin comes on to wax lyrical about winner Arrigo Sacchi. \u201cHe was visionary in my opinion,\u201d Ceferin says of the erstwhile Milan and Italy coach, who won the European Cup with the Rossoneri in 1989 and 1990. \u201cHis teams attacked home and away, he was never afraid. Great respect, he deserves the award.\u201d Sacchi takes to the stage and is presented with his gong. Luis Figo, sitting in the audience, takes a few snaps with his phone. You\u2019ve got plenty of time to make a cup of tea.     5.05pm    Hosts Pedro Pinto and Reshmin Chowdhury have taken to the stage in Istanbul. Two minutes in, and they\u2019ve already cued up the first montage. While that spools across the continent, here are the clubs most likely to win this year\u2019s Champions League, according to bookmaker aggregation site Oddschecker: Manchester City are favourites, followed by PSG, Liverpool, Bayern Munich, Real Madrid, Barcelona, Chelsea, Tottenham Hotspur, Internazionale, Atletico Madrid, Juventus, AC Milan and Borussia Dortmund. Let\u2019s see if any of that changes once the draw has been made.      5.00pm    It\u2019s Football Weekly Extra\u2019s turn to contemplate the group stage of the draw.

Previous finalists hoping to go one better at last: Atletico Madrid, Eintracht Frankfurt, Brugge, Bayer Leverkusen, Tottenham Hotspur, PSG, Manchester City.  Updated at 6.32pm BST    4.45pm    More on that television pairing thing. We might as well, we\u2019ve got time to kill. To make sure certain clubs from the same country don\u2019t clutter up the TV schedule on the same day, Uefa have made 11 pairings. All eight groups are distinguished by colour \u2013 A to D red, E to H blue \u2013 and when a paired club is drawn in, say, one of the red groups, the computer will make sure the other paired club is assigned blue. Head hurts. The pairings are as follows:  Real Madrid and Barcelona Eintracht Frankfurt and RB Leipzig Manchester City and Liverpool AC Milan and Napoli Bayern Munich and Borussia Dortmund PSG and Marseille Porto and Benfica Chelsea and Tottenham Hotspur Juventus and Internazionale Atletico Madrid and Sevilla Rangers and Celtic      4.35pm    Today\u2019s Fiver has been contemplating the upcoming draw, and is brought to you in English, Serbian and Hebrew.

This year\u2019s group stage is being squeezed into a nine-week window, as opposed to the usual three months. The things we do for Qatar. The first matchday is on Tuesday 6 September, the final one on Wednesday 2 November. Here are the dates for your diary \u2026  Matchday 1: September 6 and 7 Matchday 2: September 13 and 14 Matchday 3: October 4 and 5 Matchday 4: October 11 and 12 Matchday 5: October 25 and 26 Matchday 6: November 1 and 2  \u2026 then after everyone\u2019s run themselves into the ground at the World Cup, the competition resumes later than normal. Here\u2019s how the rest of it pans out:  Round of 16: February 14 and 15; March 7 and 8 Round of 16: February 21 and 22; March 14 and 15 Quarter finals: April 11 and 12; April 18 and 19 Semi-finals: May 9 and 10; May 16 and 17  Then the final on Saturday 10 June 2023, at the Ataturk Olympic Stadium in Istanbul. As a great man once wondered after pondering the mechanics of an unnecessarily complicated draw: who\u2019s that gonna be?     4.15pm   Preamble  The draw for the group stage of the 2022-23 Champions League takes place at the Ataturk stadium in Istanbul this evening. The seeded pots look like this \u2026  Pot 1: Real Madrid, Eintracht Frankfurt, Manchester City, AC Milan, Bayern Munich, Paris Saint Germain, Porto, Ajax Pot 2: Liverpool, Chelsea, Barcelona, Juventus, Atletico Madrid, Sevilla, RB Leipzig, Tottenham Pot 3: Borussia Dortmund, Salzburg, Shakhtar Donetsk, Internazionale, Napoli, Benfica, Sporting Lisbon, Bayer Leverkusen Pot 4: Rangers, Marseille, Copenhagen, Bruges, Celtic, Viktoria Plzen, Maccabi Haifa, Dinamo Zagreb  \u2026 and the usual rules apply. Teams from Pot 1 will be drawn into Groups A to H, then teams from the next three Pots in turn are plucked from the bowls of destiny. When a team from Pots 2, 3 and 4 are picked, a computer immediately dumps them into the first available group, taking restrictions into account. Those being: two teams from the same country can\u2019t face each other, while certain pairings from the same country must play on different nights for TV purposes. Don\u2019t ask, life\u2019s too short, that\u2019s why the computer\u2019s going to deal with it. The draw is scheduled to begin at 7pm in Istanbul, which is 5pm BST. It won\u2019t, of course, there will be a spirit-sapping amount of pomp, pish, faff and filler before anyone deigns to get down to business. But as soon as those damn balls are plucked, pulled apart, the paper within them unspooled, the names on the paper read out, and the teams assigned to groups, you\u2019ll be the first to know. It\u2019s on!  "

                    "body": "Farhad Moshiri has claimed he retains faith in the under-pressure Frank Lampard and the under-fire Everton board despite the team\u2019s descent into the relegation zone. The Everton hierarchy had been silent on Lampard\u2019s position after the calamitous 4-1 home defeat by Brighton last Tuesday but, responding to a letter from the Everton Fans\u2019 Forum, the owner offered the manager some support and insisted the club needed stability. Moshiri also rejected growing calls from a wide range of Everton supporter groups to replace the chairman, Bill Kenwright, and other members of the club\u2019s board.  \u201cI have faith in the work being done not only by our manager, but our director of football [Kevin Thelwell] and our board of directors,\u201d Moshiri wrote to the Fans\u2019 Forum. \u201cThat faith is based on my knowledge of the depth and quality of work being done both at Finch Farm [Everton\u2019s training complex] and the Royal Liver Building [Everton\u2019s administrative HQ) \u2013 and of the plan that is in place. I am confident that we have skilled, experienced and focused professionals at all levels of the club. We are all agreed that our current league position must and will improve.\u201d Lampard said last week that he did not want or need a vote of confidence from the Everton hierarchy, although the manager accepts he is in a precarious position following a run of nine defeats in 12 games. Moshiri has previous form for publicly backing a manager shortly before sacking them and has dismissed five during a turbulent seven years in charge. Everton host bottom-of-the-table Southampton on Saturday in what appears a critical game for Lampard and his team\u2019s latest relegation struggle. Everton\u2019s last match at Goodison Park, the loss to Brighton, saw chants of \u201csack the board\u201d echo around the stadium. There were similar protests during the FA Cup defeat at Manchester United on Friday and a sit-in demonstration is being organised for after Saturday\u2019s game by the #AllTogetherNow campaign.  The campaign, comprising numerous fan and social media groups plus 21 official supporter clubs, is calling on Moshiri to \u201cmake sweeping changes at chair, board and executive levels. It demands he brings in competent, experienced professionals who can reverse the club\u2019s decline, and make the necessary changes to make Everton competitive once more.\u201d The Everton Shareholders\u2019 Association also issued a statement on Wednesday, saying it is in dialogue with Moshiri. \u201cOur views are consistent with those of other groups who want positive change that will bring about a better Everton Football Club,\u201d read the statement. However, Everton\u2019s owner has claimed that a restructure at the top of a club facing another fight for Premier League survival is not on his agenda. Moshiri adds: \u201cIn almost seven years since my arrival at the club, I have significantly increased my investment and our new stadium has become reality.  \u201cWe regularly review our performance and initiate change where we feel that the club falls short of standard. This has meant that we have seen turnover in managers, directors of football and several board members, but always as we have striven to achieve success. Whilst, in virtually every instance, change has been supported and encouraged by fans, stability must be the key to progression.\u201d Meanwhile, the Football Association has announced it can charge clubs if their fans are caught singing the \u201cChelsea rent boy\u201d chant. The chant has been heard at Chelsea\u2019s recent matches against Nottingham Forest and Manchester City, and also at Everton\u2019s match at Old Trafford on Friday, when it was aimed at Lampard, a former Chelsea player and manager. While the FA has always condemned the use of the term, it has never felt able to charge clubs over its use. However, it is understood the recent conviction of the Liverpool fan Paul Boardman, who admitted using the term on his way to last season\u2019s FA Cup final against Chelsea at Wembley, was a gamechanger, and opens the door for the FA to punish clubs where fans are proven to have used the term. An FA statement said: \u201cToday, the FA has formally written to all clubs across the Premier League, EFL, National League, Women\u2019s Super League, Women\u2019s Championship and Steps 2-4, to remind them that it can pursue formal disciplinary action against any club whose supporters engage in discriminatory behaviour, now including the use of the term \u2018rent boy\u2019. The FA has now informed all clubs that it considers the \u2018rent boy\u2019 chant to be a breach of the FA rules.\u201d"

                    "body": "More than 13 years have passed since the 68th and previous staging of a fixture which is 123 years old but on Saturday has only a fourth edition since 1972: Preston North End v Tottenham Hotspur. The last time the northern and southern Lilywhites clashed came on 23 September 2009 at Deepdale when Alan Irvine\u2019s Preston suffered a 5-1 loss to the Spurs of Harry Redknapp in a League Cup tie decorated by Peter Crouch\u2019s hat-trick and strikes from Robbie Keane and Jermain Defoe, the visitors also fielding Jermaine Jenas, Wilson Palacios and a youthful Gareth Bale. Preston\u2019s scorer was Chris Brown, whose 83rd-minute strike offered only a consolation. He believes the locals will offer the Premier League millionaires a rousing \u201cWelcome to Deepdale\u201d at 6pm on Saturday when Spurs take on Ryan Lowe\u2019s 11th-placed Championship side for an FA Cup fifth-round berth. Brown says: \u201cWhen Premier League teams come to Deepdale the fans seem to raise their noise levels \u2013 it\u2019s brilliant. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if there\u2019s a full house. It\u2019s a great place to play. I remember when we played Liverpool [the previous season] and Tottenham they came out in their droves and got behind their team.  \u201cAgainst Tottenham I came on as a sub and my lasting memory of that game is this: if you think back, Gareth Bale wasn\u2019t really firing on all cylinders, there was talk about him never being on the winning Spurs team, he was having a really rough time. \u201cI came on around the same time that Defoe was going off and as he was walking off he was saying to Harry Redknapp that Bale \u2018needs to buck his ideas up\u2019, basically. That he wasn\u2019t passing the ball to his feet. It was just mad to be standing there listening to that conversation, especially knowing where Gareth Bale soon went to in terms of his level of performance. \u201cCrouch played, Wilson Palacios too \u2013 so it was great to come on and play against those type of lads.\u201d Preston beat Huddersfield 3-1 in this season\u2019s third round, while Spurs dispatched Portsmouth 1-0, Harry Kane\u2019s winner a 265th goal for the club. After a 266th in Monday\u2019s league win over Fulham, he will eclipse Jimmy Greaves and become Spurs\u2019s outright record scorer if he registers today. That would be another page in the tale of the clubs\u2019 intertwined histories. Preston are the 1888-89 Invincibles and Double winners, achieving the FA Cup part without conceding. Tottenham\u2019s 1960-61 vintage were the first team of the last century to secure the Double. The XIs of Lowe and Antonio Conte will contest a 12th FA Cup clash between the teams. The first was on 27 January 1900: Preston were 1-0 winners at Deepdale in a first-round tie. Spurs were Southern League champions that season and then, next term, came the glory of a Cup triumph as the only non-league side to win it, after facing Preston in the opening round once again, dispatching them 4-1 in a replay following a 1-1 draw at White Hart Lane.  The relationship between the clubs had first deepened when Tottenham adopted the lilywhite jerseys of the Lancashire team in homage to William Sudell\u2019s Invincibles side. Preston\u2019s major trophy haul paused after the 1938 FA Cup final, the reverse to West Ham in the 1964 final a last taste of the big time. The decline started three years before with relegation from the old First Division. Preston have twice lost playoff finals to enter the top flight \u2013 under David Moyes in 2001 and Billy Davies in 2005 \u2013 and reached the semi-final the season before Spurs last visited Deepdale. \u201cA disappointment,\u201d says Brown, who was in the team eliminated by Sheffield United. The next year \u2013 2010 \u2013 this famous name of the English game avoided a winding-up order after the intervention of Trevor Hemmings, who took over, but still plunged into the third tier the following term. Last season Hemmings died and his son Craig oversees a club that last week announced a \u00a316.8m loss in 2021-22 \u2013 an increase of \u00a33.4m from the previous 12 months. Hemmings said: \u201c2021-22 was difficult \u2013 it was the first full season back with crowds following Covid restrictions, and in the first half we changed managers [from Frankie McAvoy to Lowe]. And it was the season we lost our owner, my father. All at the club hope to further his legacy.\u201d Peter Ridsdale, a former Leeds chairman, is a director at Preston, where Lowe has constructed a team that blend the loanees Liam Delap (a Manchester City striker) and \u00c1lvaro Fern\u00e1ndez (Manchester United defender) with the experience of Robbie Brady, a former Burnley winger, and Ched Evans, who after scoring six goals in seven games has signed a contract extension. Evans will hope to do what Brown did and score, though this time for a winning Preston side that would make another piece of history. \u201cMy goal was a tap-in, like most were,\u201d Brown jokes. \u201cBut you know what? Tottenham are a good team to play at the moment as there seems to be a bit of unrest there. I know Ryan Lowe is very positive and will put out the team to do exactly that.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 30 January 2023. Tottenham won the Double in 1960-61, not 1961-62 as an earlier version said."

                    "body": "In Gareth Southgate\u2019s own words, Jadon Sancho did not deserve an England call-up for last October\u2019s World Cup qualifiers against Andorra and Hungary and yet the manager selected him regardless. Sancho was enduring a difficult time at Manchester United after his \u00a373m transfer from Borussia Dortmund and, given his form, he ought not to have been included. But Southgate had invested in the winger, who he believes can get to the very top, and he decided \u201cfor him to feel we have belief in him at this point is a good message\u201d.  Sancho\u2019s previous action for England had been to miss one of the penalties in the Euro 2020 final shootout loss to Italy in July \u2013 he was injured for the September fixtures \u2013 and Southgate wanted to get him back in the shirt, partly to begin the healing process. Sancho would get two assists in the 5-0 win over Andorra. Things would get worse for Sancho before they got better. His performances for United did not improve in time for the November internationals and Southgate dropped him, saying that he could not support him for ever. But Sancho has since turned it around at United, playing some strong games, and Southgate is expected to recall him on Thursday for this month\u2019s Wembley friendlies against Switzerland and Ivory Coast. The reason for bringing up the Sancho situation is because it has direct relevance to Southgate\u2019s biggest selection dilemma: whether to call up Marcus Rashford. The parallels are clear. Rashford is enduring a torrid time at United and, given his form, does not merit being selected. The forward has been so frustrated by his lack of minutes under the club\u2019s interim manager, Ralf Rangnick, that he has given thought to leaving Old Trafford. Rangnick\u2019s response? \u201cEven suppose he and his agents or his family at one stage of the summer think about maybe going to another club, well then he can do that but in the summer,\u201d Rangnick said. \u201cNow the window is closed.\u201d  Rashford\u2019s last action for England was to miss one of the penalties against Italy because a shoulder operation and fitness issues ruled him out of the autumn international programme. He would benefit hugely from a change of environment, a show of support from Southgate, and the manager knows it. He loves Rashford, has counted on him as one of his key lieutenants and his empathetic side will want to pick him. But can he do so given the competition in wide attacking areas? Never mind Raheem Sterling, Bukayo Saka, Jack Grealish, Phil Foden and Sancho, there is an argument that Southgate ought to recall Harvey Barnes, who is playing well at Leicester. He won his only cap as a substitute in the friendly against Wales in October 2020. Southgate has other headaches, of course, as he prepares for the final friendlies before the World Cup in Qatar and, perhaps, the last opportunity for any experimentation. England have only two more camps before the tournament \u2013 in June and September, when they play four and two Nations League ties respectively. Harry Maguire is another United player horribly out of sorts and he suffered a blow to his already brittle confidence when the club\u2019s fans cheered his substitution in Tuesday\u2019s Champions League exit against Atl\u00e9tico Madrid. Southgate remains behind the centre-half and he will select him but expect Maguire\u2019s lack of form to be a hot topic \u2013 as it was last November. Southgate has injury problems in the wing-back roles, mainly on the left, with Ben Chilwell out for the season after cruciate surgery and Luke Shaw having missed United\u2019s past three matches. Kieran Trippier, who can provide an option on the left, is out with a fractured metatarsal.  Shaw is back in training and should be called up but he would be unlikely to start in both games, leading Southgate to consider the merits of Newcastle\u2019s Matt Targett and Crystal Palace\u2019s Tyrick Mitchell. Southgate\u2019s assistant, Steve Holland, watched Palace\u2019s 0-0 draw against Manchester City on Monday night, in which Mitchell excelled. On the other flank, Reece James is struggling with a muscular issue \u2013 he has missed Chelsea\u2019s past three games \u2013 and the midfielder Kalvin Phillips is out, raising the chances of Conor Gallagher being picked. Southgate must also consider whether he has room to recall Ben White in central defence and Ollie Watkins up front. Tammy Abraham, who has scored 15 goals in 21 games for Roma since the November international break, continues to look like Southgate\u2019s first change for Harry Kane. Abraham hopes to start one of the matches."

While we already knew that Manchester City and Liverpool were both quite good at football, Sunday\u2019s ding-dong at least served to reinforce that view, even if Liverpool were uncharacteristically poor in the first half before getting what one assumes was a gegen-rocket up the collective backside from J\u00fcrgen Klopp at the break. What we learned from one of the post-match interviews is that (1) Kevin De Bruyne knows Virgil van Dijk, (2) that the Manchester City midfielder sees Virgil a lot, (3) that his and Virgil\u2019s children attend the same school and (4) like to play together which (5) provided the background for their \u201cfriendly chat\u201d on the final whistle. These revelations that elite, gifted footballers aren\u2019t actually kept cryogenically frozen in chambers only to be thawed out for training and matches appear to have come as a shock to many viewers, who had no idea that the existence of top athletes can be as mundane, if not more crushingly dull than those lived by the rest of us. Or that both men live in Cheshire, hence the pow-wows on the school run.  It also went some way towards explaining why Pep Guardiola went full Basil Fawlty \u2013 without a trace of irony or awareness \u2013 when Van Dijk clipped De Bruyne to bring him down with a technical foul that could not have been more \u2018Fernandinho\u2019 if it had a shaved head, was sporting a big 25 on its back and was dancing the samba through Londrina\u2019s main drag. Despite his anger, Pep was all smiles after the game as he and his opposite number J\u00fcrgen Klopp wrapped each other in a warm and tight embrace. With ne\u2019er a flying pizza slice, an angry finger-wagging Irishman or a 22-man stramash involving a variety of fists and boots emerging from a cartoon cloud it has become abundantly clear that the rivalry between Liverpool and Manchester City is sadly lacking in the kind of sneering mutual contempt, childish needle and belligerent rancour that powers all the most entertaining feuds. Following a weekend in which Neil Warnock announced his retirement from management, perhaps one or both clubs could bring him in as an anger-management consultant to help generate some much-needed animosity.

                    "body": "With all due respect to Australia, where the Melbourne Cup is due to stop the nation at around 4am GMT on Tuesday, the attention of the racing world this week will focus squarely on the Kentucky bluegrass, and the 14 Grade One events that make up the 39th running of the Breeders\u2019 Cup at Keeneland in Lexington this weekend.\nThis news may also grate with diehard fans of the jumps, who will argue that the Grand Sefton Chase over the National fences at Aintree will generate far more betting turnover in the UK on Saturday than any of the events in Kentucky. But the simple fact remains that jumping is a niche activity in the global racing industry, enjoyed almost exclusively in Britain, Ireland and France, while the Breeders\u2019 Cup is the richest and most prestigious meeting of the year in the country which has, by several measures, the biggest racing and breeding industry on the planet.\n\nIt is also an industry that is showing distinct signs of turning a corner after many years when it seemed that American racing was doomed to inevitable \u2013 and often self-inflicted decline.\nThe Horse Racing Integrity and Safety Act \u2013 which, among other things, transfers responsibility for dope testing and medication rules away from individual state racing commissions \u2013 came into effect on 1 July. As a result, use of the raceday drug Lasix is expected to be steadily phased out across the US, and last year\u2019s Breeders\u2019 Cup was the first to be entirely Lasix-free.\n\nOther key indicators are also positive. The US\u2019s total \u201chandle\u201d, or turnover, on racing jumped by nearly 12% last year, to $12.2bn [\u00a310.6bn], the highest figure since 2009 despite a drop of 30% in the number of races (from 49,368 to 33,567) over the intervening dozen years. Total prize money, meanwhile, was $1.1bn [\u00a3956m], more than six times the UK figure of \u00a3146m on offer in around a third of the number of races.\nAs a result, John Quinn\u2019s Highfield Princess, already a Group One winner in three different countries in her last three starts, will be chasing the biggest pot of her career by some margin when she goes to post for the Breeders\u2019 Cup Turf Sprint on Saturday. And that is one of the six events with a purse of \u201conly\u201d $1m. Six more, including the Mile and the Filly &amp; Mare Turf, both of which have several leading contenders from European stables, are $2m races, while the Turf and Classic are worth $4m and $6m respectively.\nFor a relatively small \u2013 and, to my mind at least, still criminally under-appreciated \u2013 trainer like Quinn, it is an astonishing opportunity, and with the Wesley Ward-trained Golden Pal, the winner of the race for the last two seasons, also in the field, it promises to be a compelling spectacle for the fans too.\n\nIn all, there were 45 runners from outside the US among the 205 pre-entries for this year\u2019s meeting, including Nashwa, the likely favourite for the Filly &amp; Mare Turf on Saturday when Hollie Doyle will hope to get her first Breeders\u2019 Cup winner on the board. European-trained runners are favourite for six of the seven turf events, while Highfield Princess is a narrow second-favourite for the other.\nMost positive of all from an American perspective, meanwhile, is the prospect of a meeting that builds towards the Classic, the 14th and final Breeders\u2019 Cup race, on Saturday evening, when the exceptional Flightline will attempt to defend his unbeaten record against a field that includes Life Is Good, last year\u2019s winner of the Dirt Mile.\n\nFlightline\u2019s emergence as the highest-rated dirt horse since global rankings began has gone a little under the radar on this side of the Atlantic, but he is the superstar that American racing needs as it looks to maintain the recent upswing in its fortunes. His astonishing romp in the Pacific Classic at Del Mar in early September saw Flightline\u2019s rating leap to 139, just 1lb below Frankel\u2019s benchmark figure - for any surface - of 140, and with just five runs in the book at the age of four, there is every reason to think he can push that higher still on Saturday.\n\nEuropeans stables and viewers may concentrate on the turf events but Flightline is poised to join the likes of Secretariat, Man O\u2019 War and Seattle Slew on the list of America\u2019s greatest champions. Even the most fervent of jump-racing diehards could well find something to appreciate when he goes to post at 9.40pm."

As part of its goal of reaching net zero carbon by 2030 the sport will attempt to rationalise a calendar that is currently inefficient and detrimental in its environmental impact.\nIn 2019 F1 committed to reaching net zero and has been adopting new practices to fulfil its target. The sport published its report into the progress made on sustainability, diversity and inclusion on Tuesday. \nThe report catalogues F1\u2019s actions including introducing remote broadcasting operations, redesigning freight containers enabling the use of more efficient aeroplanes and using 100% renewable energy in the sport\u2019s offices.\n\nHowever by far the greatest part of F1\u2019s carbon footprint is generated by air travel to and from race meetings. Next year the calendar is still planned to be 24 races and includes, because of previously agreed contractual arrangements, scheduling that entails unnecessary flying. \nThe race in Miami is to be held immediately after Azerbaijan, Canada is set between Spain and Austria. Japan is followed by Qatar and then the US GP and at the end of the season, Las Vegas is followed by Abu Dhabi.\nThe report confirmed that \u201cplanning for a future calendar regionalisation was under way\u201d. It is expected the new schedule would see the sport compete in four regions, each hosting its own \u201cseason\u201d comprised of the Middle East, Europe, the Americas and east Asia/Australia.\nThe plans will likely be welcomed by the teams as they entail a cost saving in freight fees and will reduce travel for personnel during a lengthy season. There is, however, no timeline as yet for its implementation. It will take time, likely several years, as F1 requires existing contracts, which specify the time of year meetings are held, to end. There will also be negotiations required around races such as Abu Dhabi which pays a premium to be the last GP of the season.\nThe report also said F1 was on course to meet its target of using 100% carbon neutral, sustainable fuel by 2026 when the new engine regulations are applied. This year cars are using a fuel with a 10% sustainable ethanol element.\nBy 2026 the intent is to be running them on a 100% synthetic fuel, which is being developed. The fuel will be designed to work in road cars and neutral in that the process used to produce it would be carbon negative to offset the carbon produced by its use in an engine.\nEllen Jones, the head of sustainability at F1, welcomed the steps the sport had made in the last three years. \u201cIt\u2019s fantastic to see the progress that\u2019s been made already,\u201d she said. \u201cThe work that\u2019s going on behind the scenes to bring this strategy to life is tireless and we are confident that we are building strong foundations for the future of our business and sport.\u201d"

                    "body": "After definitive series wins over India and England this summer \u2013 and a total of 29 wins from their last 30 ODIs \u2013 Australia head into the Women\u2019s World Cup as overwhelming favourites. It\u2019s a familiar position for this team, who have dominated world cricket for many years. But this particular tournament brings more pressure than usual, and Australia are desperate to regain the trophy after failing to make the final last time out in 2017. It does not take a wild imagination to envisage Meg Lanning hoisting the trophy in Christchurch on 3 April, but a loss to India in the third ODI of the series in September and a comprehensive defeat at the hands of New Zealand in a warm up match this week have exposed some rare weaknesses.  The inability to take wickets \u2013 which was heavily exposed in the 2017 semi-final loss to India \u2013 was again a concern against the Black Ferns. Australia failed to defend a strong total of 321, taking only one wicket as Sophie Devine (161 not out) and Amelia Kerr (92 not out) chased down the total with ease and more than six overs to spare. Rival teams will have been taking notes on the way the Ferns were able to evade the bowling of the No 1-ranked ODI team. A World Cup is a different beast to a regular series; the tiniest slip up can spell the end of a team\u2019s chances, as Australia know all too well after a shock defeat to India in the first round of the 2020 T20 World Cup brought them close to exiting the tournament at the semi-final stage. An almost miraculous break in the weather allowed that match to be played and Australia progressed to the final, which they won, but it was a close-run thing. The format of this tournament allows a little more leeway for those slip ups. Rather than being divided into two pools, the eight teams will all each play each other once, with the top four progressing to the semis. It meams there will be plenty of opportunities to make up for any early loss, though the Australians will be keen to avoid meeting hosts New Zealand at the semi-final stage. But the cloud that looms largest over the entire tournament is Covid-19. Already all-rounder Ash Gardner has tested positive and is required to isolate for 10 days; she will miss the matches against England and Pakistan. All is being done to keep the players as safe as possible, but there remains the prospect that a swathe of positive tests could derail the Australians\u2019 campaign. The depth of the Matthew Mott\u2019s squad is enviable, but the loss of any one of the likes of Beth Mooney, Tahlia McGrath or Meg Lanning for a must-win game could see the trophy quickly fall from their grasp for another four years, even if the ICC has prepared for the eventuality of a Covid-impacted tournament. \u201cIf it becomes necessary, we would allow a team to field nine players as an exception for this environment and if they had female substitutes from within their management team, we would enable two substitutes to play, non-batting, non-bowling, but to enable a game to take place,\u201d said ICC head of events Chris Tetley.  It is an exception that would have been unthinkable in pre-pandemic times \u2013 a circumstance reserved for suburban park cricket and captains who spend their Fridays furiously texting everyone they know who has ever picked up a cricket bat to try to secure numbers for the next day\u2019s game. For a national team to take the field with only nine players \u2013 in a World Cup no less \u2013 would have seemed as unlikely as international cricket being played in empty stadiums. However, the world has changed and the sight of media managers and physiotherapists fielding at long on and extra cover may not even be a novelty by the end of this tournament. As the first major tournament for women\u2019s cricket since the pandemic took hold, there are more uncertainties than the teams are accustomed to. Australia have the form and results to suggest this World Cup is theirs for the taking, but the winner may well be the team that is best able to adjust to the changing circumstances of the world we now live in. Preparation and planning can be thrown out of the window in the blink of an eye and it is the Australians\u2019 adaptability that will be put under the microscope over the course of the next month."

                    "body": "  9.27pm    David Hytner was at Al Bayt Stadium, and his report is in. Congratulations to England, commiserations to Senegal, and thanks to you all for reading this MBM. Nighty night!      9.25pm    Gareth Southgate \u2013 who after all that pre-match noise, got the big call right, huh \u2013 talks to ITV, praising \u201cthe ruthlessness of our execution, the way our team worked off the ball and without the ball. We were a bit sticky with the bal in the first 25 to 30 minutes. Our best opportunities came from winning the ball from them, and Jude and Hendo were outstanding in that aspect of the game. They\u2019re both forward-thinking midfield players. Hendo doesn\u2019t get many for us, but he\u2019s been outstanding. He\u2019s such a leader, he knits the team together, around the camp he\u2019s brilliant, and his performances have been top drawer for us. It was important for Harry Kane and for us for him to score. We\u2019ve got some super young players, and it\u2019s been right to give them their head and their opportunity. These games are brilliant life experience for them. Their progress is phenomenal. The team have made a very complicated game tonight look straightforward. France are an outstanding team with a phenomenal tournament record and some outstanding individuals. So without a doubt it\u2019s a game where we\u2019ll have to find our highest possible level.\u201d As for Raheem Sterling, who is dealing with a family matter, Southgate reports: \u201cWe\u2019ve got to wait and see. At the moment, clearly the priority is for him to be with his family. We\u2019re going to support that, and leave him to have as much time as he needs. He\u2019s going home. At the moment it\u2019s a situation that he needs time with his family to deal with, and I don\u2019t want to put him under any pressure with that. Sometimes football isn\u2019t the most important thing, and family should come first.\u201d     9.14pm    Jude Bellingham\u2019s turn, and he\u2019s in the mood to big up a team-mate as well. \u201c\u201cThe first 35 minutes were tough. They were really compact, high-energy, athletic. They got in a few times down the sides, and it was one of those games when we needed to get the first goal. We knew when we did we\u2019d be in a good position. The goal was really well worked. [Jordan Henderson] had a brilliant performance today. I see some of the rubbish that was said about him playing. Honestly, it\u2019s ridiculous. He\u2019s so under-rated technically, and he\u2019s delivered again in a big game with a massive goal, so I think it\u2019s time he gets a bit of respect.\u201d   Updated at 9.24pm GMT    9.10pm    Phil Foden speaks to ITV. \u201cWe\u2019re all buzzing with the result. We\u2019re going to celebrate tonight, but it\u2019s knockout football, so we\u2019ll have to recover tomorrow and think about our next opponent, which is going to be really tough. Senegal are a great team. They\u2019d cause some big teams problems. They were very physical. But it\u2019s about buying time and trying to work out where the space was. I\u2019ve always spoken about bringing my club form to international level, and tonight was probably my best England game, so I\u2019m really happy. France look the strongest in the competition. Everywhere you look they have talent. But we\u2019ll back ourselves on the day. We\u2019re confident.\u201d \u2026 and now he\u2019s a senior member of the squad at the grand old age of 22, he\u2019s asked about his precocious 19-year-old team-mate. \u201cI don\u2019t want to big up Jude Bellingham too much because he\u2019s still young, but he\u2019s one of the most gifted players I\u2019ve ever seen. I don\u2019t see a weakness in his game. He\u2019s got everything, and he\u2019s going to be the best midfielder in the world, for sure.\u201d   Updated at 9.18pm GMT    9.03pm    A clearly delighted Harry Kane speaks to ITV. \u201cReally chuffed, you know. Knockout games are never easy. We\u2019ve showed great maturity through the tournament. It\u2019s 3-0 against a really good side. Credit to the boys. Their mentality was top from the beginning, and we took our chances when they came. We feel good. We\u2019ve got good runners. Good players. We\u2019re solid at the back. Three clean sheets in a row is really important. A really good day for us. We have a great mixture of youth and experience. Another knockout win. It was a very good night. We\u2019ll enjoy this one, but our focus turns to France. It\u2019ll be a really tough game, they\u2019re reigning champions, it\u2019ll be a good battle. We\u2019ll recover nicely and get ready for the game.\u201d   Updated at 9.11pm GMT    9.00pm    Gareth Southgate was wearing his poker face all evening, but he allows himself a broad, warm smile now! With the not-insignificant exception of a rocky spell midway through the first half \u2013 Jordan Pickford had to save well to deny Boulaye Dia \u2013 England were much the better team tonight and fully deserved their victory. Jordan Henderson, Harry Kane and Bukayo Saka scored fine goals, while Jude Bellingham was his usual precocious self. France and Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 will offer a much sterner test on Saturday, but the champions of Africa were made to look uncharacteristically ordinary for the most part tonight, so England deserve to bask in the glory for a while before contemplating their game against the champions of the world.     8.53pm   FULL TIME: England 3-0 Senegal  England have beaten the champions of Africa and are into the quarter finals of the World Cup! They\u2019ll face France on Saturday evening.   Updated at 8.57pm GMT    8.52pm    90 min +3: Dieng blooters the free kick witlessly into the wall but the ball breaks out for a corner kick. Ismaila Sarr takes, and Kane clears. Looks like a third clean sheet on the bounce is on!     8.51pm    90 min +2: Rice connects with the bottom of Dieng\u2019s boot and it\u2019s a free kick 25 yards out, just to the right of centre. Pickford\u2019s clean sheet \u2013 and Southgate\u2019s good mood, if his reaction to England shipping two goals late against Iran \u2013 in jeopardy here.   Updated at 8.59pm GMT    8.50pm    90 min +1: Shaw works his way down the left and dinks a cross towards Rashford at the far stick. Rashford can only hook the ball into the side netting. A fine chance to get one goal closer to Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 in the race for the Golden Boot goes begging.     8.48pm    90 min: In four minutes\u2019 time, England will officially be in the quarter finals of the World Cup.   Updated at 9.19pm GMT    8.48pm    89 min: Pape Sarr flays a wild shot 40 miles over the bar. Meanwhile the England band play Jingle Bells. Good fun and all, but it\u2019s not a patch on the earlier afro-funk.     8.46pm    87 min: A first corner of the evening for Senegal, out on the left. Ballo-Toure floats a cross into Pickford\u2019s hands. It\u2019s been a good day at the office for Pickford, whose strong arm to deny Dia when the score was 0-0 (kind of) turned this game.   Updated at 9.02pm GMT    8.45pm    86 min: Mount cynically clips the in-flight Dieng from behind, and this referee is laissez-faire all right.     8.43pm    84 min: A cross into the England box from the left. Ismaila Sarr heads harmlessly over. Pickford is furious that the half-chance was given up. A-rollocking he goes.     8.42pm    82 min: Henderson makes way for Phillips. Often under-appreciated, he receives a warm ovation from the England support. Meanwhile the drums and horns of Senegal have fallen quiet now. To be fair, they\u2019d been going at it non-stop since the get-go. A masterclass in the circular breathing technique that John Coltrane would be proud of.     8.38pm    80 min: Henderson sends Rashford scampering down the right. Rashford crosses for Kane, who extends a leg, Gazza-at-Euro-96 style. He can\u2019t poke home either.   Updated at 8.42pm GMT    8.36pm    78 min: An England free kick out on the left. Shaw curls it into the mixer. Neither Kane nor Rashford can get on the end of it. \u201cEngland are not letting the country down,\u201d writes John Neal, replying to Paul Griffin (61 min). \u201cThey are raising hopes to a fever pitch before the inevitable plucky loss on penalties to France.\u201d     8.35pm    77 min: A double change for England: Bellingham and Stones are replaced by Mount and Dier.   Updated at 8.40pm GMT    8.34pm    76 min: Koulibaly clatters crassly into the back of Kane, and turns out the referee does have his notebook with him after all. In he goes!     8.33pm    74 min: Everyone lines up on the edge of the box. Pape Sarr tries to shock Pickford by whipping the long-distance free kick towards the unguarded bottom-right corner. Think a mirror image of the free kick Gary McAllister scored for Liverpool in the Merseyside derby back in 2001. Anyway, Sarr isn\u2019t as accurate as McAllister, and the side netting rustles. Also, Pickford was quickly across and had it covered, unlike his Everton predecessor back in the day.     8.32pm    73 min: Diedhiou is into the thick of it immediately, bustling down the middle. He lays off to Dieng, who is bowled over by Shaw. Free kick in a central position, 30 yards out.     8.30pm    72 min: Dia makes way for Diedhiou.     8.28pm    70 min: Ismaila Sarr crosses from the left. The ball nestles harmlessly on the top of Pickford\u2019s net. Senegal haven\u2019t threatened to get back into this game at all. They were on top until England scored their first, at which point their belief went AWOL.     8.27pm    68 min: Mind you, it\u2019s not been a dirty or ill-tempered game, so the referee must be doing something right. Let him feel the love.   Updated at 9.16pm GMT    8.26pm    67 min: Nampalys Mendy comes crashing into Rice and becomes yet another player slightly fortunate not to go into the referee\u2019s notebook. Assuming the referee\u2019s got one, plus pencil, etc. It would explain a lot.     8.24pm    65 min: With England three up, Southgate takes the opportunity to refresh his front line. Saka and Foden, who have both excelled this evening, make way for Rashford and Grealish.     8.23pm    64 min: Henderson and Gueye accidentally knock knees. Henderson really felt that, but looks like he\u2019ll be good to continue.   Updated at 8.26pm GMT    8.22pm    63 min: England take it down a notch.      8.19pm    61 min: Bellingham slides in hard on Sabaly, and is lucky he fails to make contact. The referee makes do with a quiet word. \u201cI\u2019m not sure I approve of this ruthless, calm, ferociously kinetic performance,\u201d writes Paul Griffin. \u201cCould it be that by playing in this profoundly un-English way, our lads are in some way letting the country down?\u201d     8.18pm    59 min: England are in full flow. Kane finds Walker down the right. He\u2019s got team-mates to find in the middle, but batters his cross into the startled grid of the first man.     8.17pm   GOAL! England 3-0 Senegal (Saka 57)  Saka rewards Gareth Southgate for his selection! Foden skates down the left, past the sliding Sabaly, then the static Koulibaly, and crosses for Saka, who dinks elegantly, first time, over the sprawling, stranded Mendy. Another lovely goal!    Updated at 8.36pm GMT    8.15pm    56 min: Kane cuts in from the left and pearls a shot straight at Mendy from 25 yards. It should be an easy claim, but Mendy lets the ball squirt through his legs. The Senegal keeper is extremely lucky that the spin on the ball stops it dead, and he\u2019s able to flop over it. That could easily have flown into the net.     8.13pm    54 min: Kane slips Saka away down the inside-right channel. Saka aims for the top-right corner but the shot\u2019s always heading high and wide. England look extremely comfortable right now. Senegal haven\u2019t put anything together since the restart.   Updated at 8.17pm GMT    8.12pm    53 min: Foden drops deep in the pocket. He draws a couple of players before flicking a ball down the inside-left channel with a view to releasing Kane. Right idea, but the pass is overhit.     8.10pm    52 min: Senegal may be two down, but their fans are still giving it plenty. They\u2019ve been on the drums and horns all evening. A sensational soundtrack.   Updated at 8.13pm GMT    8.09pm    50 min: Sabaly cuts back from the byline to the right of the England goal. Pape Sarr has a whack from distance. He catches it well but the ball\u2019s always sailing wide right.     8.08pm    49 min: Bellingham is everywhere. He now races towards the Senegal box but is checked in the no-nonsense manner by Koulibaly. Senegal are living on the brink right now.     8.07pm    47 min: Jakobs\u2019 clearing header is poor, allowing Henderson to make good down the right. He reaches the byline and stands one up into the middle, but there\u2019s nobody there to score England\u2019s third. \u201cI\u2019m just back from the Co-op,\u201d reports Andrew Benton of pre-kick-off fame. Andrew might have some more shopping to do on Saturday evening, the way this is heading.     8.04pm    England get the second half underway. Senegal make three changes: Ndiaye, Diatta and Ciss are replaced by Gueye, Dieng and Pape Sarr. \u201cWhisper it but that run and ball of Bellingham for the second goal was a little reminiscent of Maradona putting in Caniggia for the winner against Brazil in 1990,\u201d opines Adam Hirst. \u201cThe one that made the Brazilian girl cry. A lighter version but similar movements and balance. He really is the business.\u201d   Updated at 8.10pm GMT    7.56pm    Half-time entertainment. A couple of in-form strikers are awaiting the winner of this one.       7.50pm   HALF TIME: England 2-0 Senegal  England started the half well, sagged worryingly, then finally hit their straps to hit Senegal with a late double whammy. Two fine goals, and England have one foot in the quarter finals. They\u2019re 45 minutes away from a showdown with France!     7.49pm   GOAL! England 2-0 Senegal (Kane 45+3)  Senegal have one last probe for an equaliser before the break. But then they\u2019re bit on the break. Bellingham steals the ball in the Senegal half. He draws a few green shirts but holds them off as he dribbles upfield. Then he slides a pass down the inside left for Foden, who immediately switches it back for Kane, romping free down the inside right. Kane enters the box, and he\u2019s always going to slot past Mendy and open his World Cup 2022 account. Finally. What a time to do it!     Updated at 8.04pm GMT    7.47pm    45 min +1: Saka crudely bodychecks Sarr, but he\u2019s not going into the book either. On this subject, Joe Pearson sent this in a good half-hour ago: \u201cReferee from El Salvador? Concacaf rules, then. Watch for a lot of physical play not being called. Just sayin\u2019.\u201d  Updated at 7.58pm GMT    7.46pm    45 min: Rice\u2019s low cross from the right is cut out by Koulibaly for another England corner. Foden looks for Bellingham but Senegal clear. There\u2019ll be two added minutes.     7.45pm    44 min: Henderson has by all accounts been mentoring Bellingham during this World Cup. They marked combining for the goal with a curious but sweet nose-to-nose celebration.   Updated at 7.54pm GMT    7.44pm    43 min: Bellingham slips Shaw into space down the left. Shaw enters the box, thinks about shooting, then thinks about crossing, then manages neither as Mendy ushers him away from goal. Shaw settles for a corner that leads to nothing.     7.42pm    42 min: England suddenly have their tails up. Saka bustles down the right again and curls into the centre for Foden, who can\u2019t get up high enough to send a header goalwards. Goal kick. Suddenly Senegal could do with hearing the half-time whistle.     7.41pm    41 min: It should be two. Pickford launches long. Saka skitters down the right and cuts back for Kane, who leans back and lifts a shot well over the bar from 12 yards.     7.40pm    40 min: Senegal were starting to get on top back there. But now look. That was a simple but lovely move, and it opened up Senegal with ease.     7.39pm   GOAL! England 1-0 Senegal (Henderson 39)  Kane drops deep to quarterback. He finds Bellingham with a sliderule pass down the inside-left channel. Bellingham reaches the Senegal box and rolls across for Henderson, who calmly steers a first-time shot across Mendy and into the bottom right!    Updated at 9.21pm GMT    7.38pm    38 min: Ndiaye has the opportunity to release Diatta into the England box down the inside-right channel but overcooks the pass. Goal kick. And then \u2026     7.37pm    37 min: Nothing comes of the resulting free kick.     7.37pm    36 min: Sarr picks Walker\u2019s pocket and makes off down the left wing. Walker tugs him back and should go into the book, but the referee only awards the free kick. Senegal coach Aliou Ciss\u00e9 demands Walker be shown the yellow card, but he\u2019s not getting his wish.     7.35pm    35 min: That really was a fine save by Pickford. Not only was the ball unpredictably ballooning up from the turf, Stones was also in the road attempting to block. He\u2019d have seen it late. What reactions.     7.33pm    33 min: Kane works the ball in from the left, looking for Saka in the Senegal box. Jakobs gets in between ball and man, allowing Edouard Mendy to come off his line to claim.     7.32pm    32 min: Saka cheaply gifts possession to Sarr down the left. Sarr cuts infield, thinks about shooting, then plays a cute reverse pass down the inside-left channel. Dia strides into the box and whistles a shot into the ground and across Pickford, in the direction of the bottom right. Pickford sticks out a strong arm to block brilliantly, and with Dia unable to react to the rebound, England are able to clear. Another good chance for Senegal!   Updated at 7.37pm GMT    7.30pm    30 min: A period of sustained patient Senegalese possession now. One for the purists at the moment, this match.     7.29pm    28 min: England slow the game right down. Again. Stones eventually gets fed up and tries a Hollywood pass. Intercepted. The ball breaks to Maguire who hoicks upfield with extreme prejudice. You\u2019ve seen better periods of play this month.     7.26pm    26 min: England take the sting out of the game with a little bit of sterile professionalism in the centre circle. Not the worst idea in the wake of that close call, Senegal with their tails up. \u201cJust imagine if this possession stat was tracked back in the old Crazy Gang days,\u201d writes Andy \u2018Not that one\u2019 Flintoff. \u201cWimbledon 20%, Watford 20%, 60% in contest.\u201d     7.24pm    24 min: There\u2019s a quick check by VAR for a penalty, but you can\u2019t be penalising Stones for that, and the game is soon underway again.     7.24pm    23 min: A huge chance for Senegal! Maguire\u2019s poor clearance is intercepted by Diatta, who crosses from the right. Dia highkicks on the penalty spot. The ball pings off Stones\u2019 knee and onto his forearm, then breaks to Sarr, who blazes over from six yards. What an opportunity!   Updated at 7.27pm GMT    7.21pm    21 min: Walker attempts to cut infield from the right. The ball pings off Sarr. Corner, though it takes the referee and linesman an absolute age to award it. More standing around. Eventually it\u2019s fired in by Foden. Stones heads-and-shoulders it wide and high right. Goal kick.   Updated at 7.26pm GMT    7.19pm    19 min: England suddenly slow down to a virtual halt. Maguire and Stones with the ball at their feet, the incredible standing men. There\u2019s patience and there\u2019s patience.     7.17pm    17 min: \u2026 so having said that, Ndiaye bothers Maguire down the right wing and nearly bursts clear. Stones comes across to make sure no serious problem develops for England.     7.16pm    16 min: Senegal are struggling to hold onto possession in the England half. How they\u2019ll be missing Sadio Man\u00e9. \u201cWhat is IN Contest\u2019s xG from all this possession?\u201d wonders Richard Hirst.     7.14pm    14 min: Diallo is a split second late on Kane and earns himself the first lecture of the match.   Updated at 7.19pm GMT    7.13pm    13 min: England are enjoying a fair bit of joy down the left flank. Kane whips in a cross that again has Edouard Mendy flapping. Saka trots into the six-yard box without too much conviction. A little more, and he might have trundled that home from close range.     7.12pm    12 min: England have enjoyed 60 percent of possession so far. Senegal just 25. The mysterious IN Contest makes off with his usual 15 percent share.     7.10pm    10 min: The ball is switched out. It\u2019s gone flat.   Updated at 7.16pm GMT    7.10pm    9 min: Edouard Mendy gives Diallo a hospital pass, and Saka nearly steals the ball away in the Senegal box. Mendy makes up for it by reclaiming possession. England come again, Bellingham swinging a gorgeous ball in from the left. Mendy continues to act skittishly, flapping at the cross, but there\u2019s nobody in a white shirt to take advantage.     7.08pm    8 min: England break out a training-ground move. The free kick\u2019s worked short to Walker on the right, then back towards Maguire on the left-hand corner of the six-yard box. Maguire hooks a cross into the centre. Senegal clear.   Updated at 7.13pm GMT    7.07pm    7 min: Bellingham wins another free kick, this time by working his way down the left only to be skittled by Diatta. England load the box. Shaw prepares to deliver.     7.06pm    6 min: Senegal are pressing England hard in these early exchanges. Ciss gets up in Bellingham\u2019s grille. A garden variety foul, but he\u2019s let the England midfielder know he\u2019s there.     7.05pm    4 min: Dia goes racing at speed down the inside-right channel and makes it all the way into the England box. Neither Maguire nor Stones look particularly happy as they give chase, but between them they manage to shut the door just in time, the ball coming off Maguire\u2019s shin and bobbling into Pickford\u2019s possession. That got the crowd going.   Updated at 7.10pm GMT    7.04pm    3 min: Henderson steals the ball off a snoozing Nampalys Mendy. For a second, it looked as though he\u2019d tear into a bit of space down the left, but the legs won\u2019t take him there. Henderson keeps probing, though, and nearly releases Foden into the box. The ball flies out for a goal kick.     7.02pm    2 min: Senegal ping the ball around hectically for a minute or so. Pickford blooters it into the stand. A fairly nondescript start.   Updated at 9.23pm GMT    7.00pm    England take the knee \u2026 and Senegal get the ball rolling. Here we go, then!   Updated at 7.05pm GMT    6.58pm    The teams are out! England in white, Senegal in green. A fantastic atmosphere bubbling up at the Al Bayt Stadium. We\u2019ll be off after the Senegalese national anthem Le Lion rouge, and the English equivalent God Save The [Mumbled Confusion]. Everyone still getting used to it, you see. \u201cThe last time I went to the Co-op, England scored two goals in quick succession,\u201d begins Andrew Benton. \u201cI\u2019m now in a quandary of sorts - should I go immediately at 7pm to ensure we get off to a good start and have a nice early dinner to boot, or bear the pangs of hunger until a bit later for a rip-roaring fightback?\u201d   Updated at 6.59pm GMT    6.51pm    Gareth Southgate is asked about Raheem Sterling\u2019s absence by ITV. \u201cHe\u2019s dealing with a family matter. I\u2019ve had quite a bit of time with him this morning, but I\u2019ve now had to pass that on to other people to help him with that. He\u2019s going to go and deal with that matter, and we\u2019ll have to take it from there.\u201d As for his team selection? \u201cSaka was excellent in our first two matches. Marcus was also very good. It\u2019s great to have him able to come into the game as it opens up. We have an embarrassment of riches in that area of the pitch. We\u2019ve liked Bukayo\u2019s performances, and think Phil and him deserve that opportunity.\u201d And what do England have to do to win? \u201cWe\u2019ve got to play our way. We\u2019ve got to play to our strengths. We\u2019ve shown what we\u2019re about in this tournament, and have to continue that tonight. Resilience, experience. You have to be able to adapt, adjust and respond to everything that is thrown at you. You have to be there with the answers, and we have to do that tonight.     6.45pm    The hotly* anticipated** return of PENNANT WATCH! The trinket Harry Kane will be handing over couldn\u2019t scream THIS\u2019LL DO more loudly if THIS\u2019LL DO was printed on it in 96-point type. The FA may as well print out a sheet of A4 and be done with it.  His opposite number Kalidou Koulibaly will present a much more lively number. Bold without being busy, colourful yet uncluttered. Mind you, a thicker, plusher, more generous helping of tasseling wouldn\u2019t have gone amiss. There\u2019s a thin line between decadence and desolation.  * barely** considered     6.19pm    Pre-match postbag o\u2019philosophical pondering. \u201cAccording to your French fellow MBMer at the RMC Sport, who I\u2019d like to think sips on a lovely burgundy throughout the match, Jules Kound\u00e9 has said that France don\u2019t have a preference for which side they face. In their shoes I\u2019d be more confident about outscoring the English offence than I would about getting past Koulibaly and company in the Senegalese defence\u201d \u2013 K\u00e1ri Tulinius. \u201cI think we (and various pundits) need to move beyond the idea that not playing from the start equates to being \u2018dropped\u2019, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s how the game works any more. If Southgate has a plan for the whole game, that should include judicious use of substitutes (probably including Rashford). If that plan works, then great. If it doesn\u2019t, then the pitchforks come out. Such is life, but the idea that a starting place always outranks coming off the bench seems outdated\u201d \u2013 Tom Hopkins. \u201cInteresting to know about the intra-African rivalries. On the other hand, with the possible exception of Brazil and Argentina, Latin Americans tend to cheer for whichever one of us is left in the tournament, even if our departure was at the hands of each other. In fact, I would say this goodwill extends even to Spain and the United States. Maybe rather than being continent based, it\u2019s based on a sense of shared identity? I wonder if the world marking us out as Latinos, a grouping which has no basis in race or ethnicity, makes it so we see ourselves as one precisely because the world groups us this way? I wonder\u201d \u2013 Casiano Martinez.     5.58pm    Bukayo Saka\u2019s replacement of Marcus Rashford is the one change to the England starting XI from the 3-0 defeat of Wales. Raheem Sterling is absent altogether as he deals with a family matter. Senegal are without defensive midfielder Idrissa Gueye. The Everton man picked up his second yellow of the tournament in the 2-1 win over Ecuador and is suspended. Nampalys Mendy of Leicester City takes over in midfield, while Monaco winger Krepin Diatta replaces Pape Gueye.     5.53pm   The teams  England: Pickford, Walker, Stones, Maguire, Shaw, Henderson, Rice, Bellingham, Saka, Kane, Foden.Subs: Grealish, Rashford, Trippier, Pope, Phillips, Dier, Coady, Alexander-Arnold, Mount, Ramsdale, Wilson, Maddison, Gallagher. Senegal: Edouard Mendy, Sabaly, Koulibaly, Diallo, Jakobs, Ciss, Nampalys Mendy, Ndiaye, Diatta, Ismaila Sarr, Dia.Subs: Seny Dieng, Formose Mendy, Cisse, Jackson, Moussa N\u2019Diaye, Ballo-Toure, Pape Sarr, Diedhiou, Ahmadou Dieng, Gomis, Name, Loum N\u2019Diaye, Pape Gueye. Referee: Ivan Barton (El Salvador).     5.51pm    Confirmation that Saka gets the nod over Rashford. In social-media form. The old-school way of doing things via the wires coming right up.      5.44pm    Bukayo Saka for Marcus Rashford: a contentious decision? It\u2019s not, is it. \u201cI\u2019m astonished Rashford isn\u2019t playing,\u201d said Gary Lineker on the BBC. But Gareth Southgate can\u2019t play everyone. Yes, Rashford is best-poised right now to chase down five-goal Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 for the Golden Boot, after scoring his second and third goals of this World Cup against Wales. But then Saka notched twice in an impressive performance against Iran. File this one under: Nice Problem To Have. Of course, as Jonathan Wilson pointed out the other day, if/when it goes the shape of a pear for England, Southgate will get it in the neck whatever he does, so he may as well call it as he sees it.      5.32pm    An update from Our Jacob via That Elon.      5.28pm    Some early team news courtesy of Jacob Steinberg in Qatar. \u201cWe\u2019re still waiting for confirmed team news but word at the Al Bayt Stadium is that Bukayo Saka and Phil Foden both start for England. Raheem Sterling has not won his place back. It means likely disappointment for Marcus Rashford, who has three goals in three games.\u201d   Updated at 5.45pm GMT    5.00pm   Preamble  The champions of Africa against the runners-up of Euro 2020. It\u2019s a big one, this, all right. But let\u2019s get it straight: tonight, Senegal will be representing the whole of Africa Senegal. As Nedum Onuoha explained on Football Weekly a couple of days ago, the notion that the entire continent cheers together as one \u201cneeds to be put in the bin\u201d (from 14m 57s). Fans of Nigeria, Ghana, Egypt and the Cote d\u2019Ivoire, to pull some random examples out of the ether, may have trenchant views on the possibility of the Lions of Teranga making it to the quarters. Having said that, from a Lions of Three perspective, it\u2019s still worth taking a quick look at England\u2019s record against African nations at the World Cup. They\u2019ve never lost, which is good news for those who use history as a crutch. However, they\u2019ve never really impressed either. A competent 2-0 win over Tunisia in 1998, a deserved last-gasp Harry Kane-inspired victory against the same opponents 20 years later, and that\u2019s about it. What else? A goalless draw against Morocco in 1986, during which Ray Wilkins lost the noggin, threw the ball at the ref, and became the first England player to be sent packing at the World Cup. A goalless draw against Algeria in 2010, after which Wayne Rooney\u2019s lid started to rattle disconcertingly, having a pop back at fans who were having a pop at him. A goalless draw against Nigeria in 2002 that was nondescript even by the standards of the Sven-Goran Eriksson era. And then there was Italia 90. England scraped past Egypt 1-0, then against Cameroon in the quarter-finals were, to quote Macka B, \u201clucky, lucky, very lucky, lucky\u201d.  So it\u2019s swings and roundabouts. A place in the quarter finals against France is the prize on offer. Kick off is at 7pm BST, 10pm at the Al Bayt Stadium in Al Khor. \u0627\u0646\u0647 \u064a\u062d\u062f\u062b! It\u2019s on!

                    "body": "In early March, military experts reported that Russian tanks were sporting handwritten \u201cZ\u201d symbols. The letter, thought to be a staunchly pro-war symbol of Vladimir Putin\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, was soon spotted at Russian bus stops, a school, then on a Russian gymnast\u2019s uniform during a World Cup event at Qatar. On 8 March, 18-year-old TikToker Matt Welland explained the symbol\u2019s meaning and its significance to his 2.4 million subscribers, along with the caption \u201cthe \u2018Z\u2019 symbol is more terrifying than you think\u201d. The scale of the influence of social media personalities such as Welland in disseminating current affairs was revealed last week. An Ofcom report found that, for the first time, Instagram was the most popular news source among teenagers, used by 29% of them in 2022, while 28% used TikTok and YouTube.  BBC One and BBC Two, previously the most popular news sources in this age group, were pushed down to fifth place, while TikTok saw the largest increase of any site, going from 1% of UK adults using the site in 2020 for news to 7% in 2022 \u2013 the same as Sky News\u2019 website and app. TikTok\u2019s growth is mostly down to young people, with half of its news users aged 16 to 24. Gully Burrows has nearly 464,000 TikTok subscribers and covers quirky news stories. One of his most popular videos on his channel (@gullyburrows) is \u201cwhat will happen when Philip dies\u201d. Published three weeks before the Duke of Edinburgh\u2019s death, it has had 16 million views. In it, Burrows speaks in front of a green screen and shows all the events that would follow Prince Philip\u2019s death, including the palace alerting the BBC and flags across the country being flown at half-mast. Burrows, previously a Mirror journalist and now a deputy editor at the National, said young people, and audiences more generally, wanted bitesize news they can fit into their busy schedule. \u201cPeople get bored quickly. They don\u2019t want to be dragged on,\u201d he said. \u201cNews needs to be incredibly precise.\u201d An age divide within the media has been growing for some time, he said. \u201cI did a placement at the Six O\u2019Clock News for BBC years ago, and young people just aren\u2019t watching that show,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople who work at ITV News say the same thing. Their demographic is 60-plus. People don\u2019t want to sit down and watch the news for a whole hour any more. If you sit down and watch BBC news, you\u2019ll probably hear 10 stories in a half-hour period, but you\u2019d get that in five or 10 minutes on TikTok.\u201d  Ilesanmi Oluwasikemi, 16, agreed: \u201cMost teenagers don\u2019t listen to the news on TV like older people.\u201d She said social media was a way to keep up with current affairs while scrolling. With 2.4 million subscribers, Welland has one of the biggest UK TikTok news accounts. His channel (@itsmattw_01) covers topics including \u201cwhat happens when a president leaves office\u201d and \u201cdumbest celebrity purchases\u201d. He shares clips in which he asks strangers questions such as, \u201cWhat conspiracy theory do you believe?\u201d \u201cI started in 2020,\u201d the student from West Sussex said. \u201cI always wanted to do YouTube but never thought I could get big on the platform.\u201d But with time on his hands during the pandemic, he gave TikTok a go. \u201cI began posting 20 videos a day and my channel got quite big.\u201d His videos regularly reach more than a million views, with his top performing hitting 11 million. He now wants to transition into traditional media. \u201cI want to make documentaries like Louis Theroux,\u201d he said of his career idol. For some young people, traditional news sources are near-irrelevant. Philip, 16, is interested in current affairs and gets his news through Instagram Stories \u2013 an in-app feature where posts disappear after 24 hours. \u201cThe only time I visit news sites is to look further into stories I\u2019ve heard of or seen,\u201d he said. \u201cPhysical newspapers are not of interest to me other than being good for starting the living room fire. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever bought or read a magazine either.\u201d  Some TikTokers feel they have cracked what young people want from news. Matilda Head, 21, set up a TikTok account (@matildasnewsroom) in 2021 as a student journalist and now has 18,000 followers. Personality is key, she said. \u201cAt first I\u2019d write a full script, but over time I began to add more of my character into my videos. Now I\u2019ll ad-lib so it\u2019s as if I\u2019m talking to a friend, like, \u2018Did you hear what happened in the Tory leadership debate?\u2019.\u201d Head is not surprised at the latest Ofcom figures, saying her own audience is driven in bulk from 13- to 25-year-olds. Welland reports a similar trend. \u201cYoung people feel they now have their own medium rather than being treated as junior \u2013 and often overlooked \u2013 participants in mainstream media publics,\u201d said Sonia Livingstone, professor in the department of media and communications at the London School of Economics. But for all its exciting potential, reliance on TikTok for news raises some issues. \u201cHateful fear-mongering disinformation has always been profitable,\u201d said Dr Zoetanya Sujon, senior lecturer at the London College of Communication. \u201cWhat TikTok brings is a very engaging, friendly platform that is really hard to regulate, with the personalised algorithm in its For You page. It\u2019s really hard to identify [problematic] content.\u201d \u201cIn the Johnny Depp/Amber Heard case, tons of accounts supported Depp through hashtags, such as, \u2018I stand with Johnny Depp\u2019 or \u2018Amber Heard is a Turd\u2019, getting millions of views and getting shared across all sorts of social media.\u201d"

                    "body": "It was a freezing night in east London, but inside Little Baobab, an inconspicuous Senegalese restaurant hidden away in a building in Clapton, there was cautious buzz of optimism. Usually the venue hosts Senegalese musicians, often playing mbalax, a type of Senegalese and Gambian dance music. But tonight, it was all about the football, with the crowd of 40 or so largely hopeful their team could reach the quarter-finals of the World Cup for just the second time. Khadim Mbamba, the restaurant\u2019s chef, refused to sit, but chose instead to lean nervously against a chair at the very back of the room. \u201cSome people have told me Senegal only have a 15% chance of winning,\u201d he said. \u201cI would say 35%. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s going to be many goals, though. 1-0 or 2-1, maybe.\u201d For Mbamba, it\u2019s significant the team are led by Aliou Ciss\u00e9, a veteran of the famous 2002 campaign when Senegal beat then world champions France. \u201cWe were coached by French managers so long. Now, most of the African teams are coached by Africans. Every country has its own mentality. A Senegalese manager knows how to handle the team and deal with the players.\u201d The Senegalese team are no stranger to grief. In the year of the 2002 World Cup campaign, the MV Le Joola, a ferry that connects Senegalese coastal cities, sank and 1,863 people lost their lives. Eleven of them were relatives of Ciss\u00e9, and his sister was one of the dead. Two years ago, Papa Bouba Diop, the sole scorer in that famous victory against the French, died suddenly at the age of 42. The players led tributes to Diop ahead of their victory against Ecuador. Though their talisman, Sadio Man\u00e9, was cruelly injured before the tournament, and former Paris Saint-Germain Germain midfielder Idrissa Gueye was suspended, this is a Senegalese team with real quality \u2013 among them goalkeeper \u00c9douard Mendy and defender Kalidou Koulibaly, both of whom play for Chelsea. Ndene, a teacher and friend of Khadim, said that for some of the players who don\u2019t play at that level, competing in the knockout rounds of this tournament is an opportunity to earn themselves a move to a bigger club. \u201cEvery team wants to have Harry Kane. But the young Senegalese players really want to prove themselves,\u201d Ndene said. \u201cThere are some young players, 23 or 24 years old. Iliman Ndiaye [of Sheffield United] for example, who plays in the Championship. Next year he wants to be in the Premier League.\u201d Ahead of the kick-off, the Senegalese anthem was hummed discreetly by only a few in the restaurant, but as it went on, more and more joined in, until by the time of the crescendo it was raucous, people standing and belting out the tune. Then, as the game got under way, the room rang with yelps of encouragement and appeals to the referee, peaking when the video assistant referee denied Senegal a penalty after the ball cannoned off the hand of England defender John Stones. But the positivity drained from the room when England went 2-0 up in added time in the first half. At the break, the mood was subdued, with the Lions of Teranga 2-0 behind. Behind the projector screen showing the match, enticing smells emanated from stainless steel vats: small deep-fried pastries called fataya, mafe peanut butter and vegetable stew, chicken yassa with onions, caramelised with lime. Customers queued and the food restored some buoyancy. Ashley grew up in Leyton, and had been to Little Baobab before. \u201cUsually I\u2019d watch an England match at the pub,\u201d she said. \u201cBut to come here, to see the Senegalese culture, and eat the great food \u2013 it\u2019s a different experience.\u201d And there was still hope. Reuben is from Derbyshire, but lives in east London. \u201cI\u2019m British through and through,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I want to see an African country do well, just one time. I\u2019m happy whoever wins, but now, with Ghana and Cameroon out, it\u2019s all on Senegal.\u201d Michael, a French national of Senegalese descent, was upbeat. \u201cSenegal have been the better team. I think we have a chance of getting back into it.\u201d But then it was on again, and just before the hour mark, England added to their lead through Bukayo Saka. Underneath the traditional Senegalese fabric bunting hung from the ceiling, the mood fell flat. Some got up and left. The final whistle blew, and the current holders of the African Cup of Nations were out. There was applause at full-time. And then the mbalax started back up, rhythmic and intensely joyful. \u201cIt was expected. Now I\u2019m supporting France,\u201d said Michael. So what next? \u201cKeep Aliou as the coach. Now we just look forward to the next African Cup of Nations \u2026 and winning it again.\u201d"

There has been interest from the country in hosting an officially sanctioned Women\u2019s Tennis Association event, which the WTA has not yet pursued. A slew of current and former top players have already committed to the lucrative exhibition in December during the short off-season, including Norrie, who is the British No 1, Daniil Medvedev and Andrey Rublev of Russia, Alexander Zverev of Germany, Stan Wawrinka of Switzerland and Austria\u2019s Dominic Thiem. The inaugural edition was held in December 2019, which also featured Medvedev and Wawrinka. In a statement, Norrie said he would not be commenting on any political issues on his arrival in Saudi Arabia and that he is attending the Diriyah Tennis Cup to prepare for the Australian Open. \u201cI\u2019m not a politician and I don\u2019t feel it\u2019s right for me to get involved with individual government politics,\u201d said Norrie. \u201cMy job is to be a professional tennis player and this event in Saudi allows me to train with some of the best players in the world and to potentially win the Australian Open.\u201d Amnesty International UK\u2019s Felix Jakens suggested Norrie and others could use their presence in Saudi Arabia to show solidarity with Salma al-Shehab, the Leeds University student jailed for 34 years there for using Twitter. \u201cWe were never going to be telling people like Cameron Norrie where they should or shouldn\u2019t play tennis, but by appearing in Diriyah Cameron should realise he\u2019s effectively being deliberately hired in to take part in the latest jamboree of Saudi sportswashing,\u201d said Jakens. \u201cCameron has a big platform and genuine influence, and he should use this to show solidarity with people like Salma al-Shehab who are being cruelly persecuted in Saudi Arabia. What Saudi Arabia appears to look for with these competitions is a smiling high-profile sports star who will studiously avoid talking about human rights \u2013 Cameron should speak out.\u201d Up to seven-figure appearance fees have been offered to some top tennis players since the inaugural event in 2019, but not all have entertained them. Matt Gentry, Andy Murray\u2019s agent, revealed at the beginning of the year that he had turned down an offer to compete in the 2019 edition, which Murray echoed at Wimbledon. \u201cI know a number of the other guys on the tour were offered to play there. I don\u2019t think the player field that went was what they were hoping. A lot of the, I would say, top players and bigger names turned it down. And I personally wouldn\u2019t go and play there,\u201d said Murray. BSG Sports Group, the organisers\u2019 media team, have been approached for comment."

                    "body": "Sarina Wiegman has acknowledged that the England captain, Steph Houghton, is in a race to be fit for the European Championship finals this summer.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be very tight,\u201d the England manager said as she named a 24-strong squad for the World Cup qualifiers against North Macedonia in Skopje and Northern Ireland in Belfast next month. \u201cShe\u2019s had a tremendous CV with us so I hope she\u2019ll make it but first of all she needs to start training again.\u201d\nAfter captaining England to the semi-finals of their past three major tournaments, Houghton is desperate to be involved in the July showpiece on home soil but the central defender has barely played for Manchester City this season and underwent achilles surgery last month.\nAlthough she turns 34 next month and, because of injuries, has not played under the manager, Houghton remains sufficiently important to the Lionesses for Wiegman to give her until the last minute to prove her fitness.\n\u201cWe can give her a little more time because of the history she has with this group, over the years,\u201d Wiegman said. \u201cShe\u2019s been out for a long time but she came back in January and played well before then having to step out again. Her competitive instinct is really high and she\u2019s doing everything she can to try and make the Euros, so we\u2019ll see. She has a clear plan and we\u2019re in contact all the time.\u201d\n\nWiegman said the squad for the forthcoming World Cup qualifiers was \u201cclose\u201d to the group she hopes will contest the Euros but indicated there could be a place for the Manchester winger Chloe Kelly should she prove her fitness after major knee surgery.\n\u201cThe door is not closed to any other player but if anyone else comes in now it probably means we made the wrong decisions earlier,\u201d Wiegman joked before explaining she was keeping a \u201cclose eye\u201d on Kelly. \u201cShe\u2019s had a pretty tough injury, an ACL. Hopefully, she will play again very soon \u2013 that\u2019s what we expect. We know how good she was before she got injured but it will probably take a little time for her to get back to the level she\u2019s capable of.\u201d\n\nAlthough Fran Kirby remains integral to England\u2019s ambitions this summer, Chelsea\u2019s attacking playmaker has been omitted from this squad. Kirby has not featured in her club\u2019s past six matches and Emma Hayes, Chelsea\u2019s manager, recently said the 28-year-old needed a break after an intense schedule.\n\u201cFran Kirby\u2019s not ready to play,\u201d said Wiegman. \u201cWe don\u2019t know yet but we hope she\u2019ll be back on the pitch pretty soon.\u201d\nWith England having won all six qualifiers to date as they look to confirm their attendance at next year\u2019s World Cup in Australia and New Zealand, breaking into the squad is not easy but the Chelsea striker Beth England will hope to prove undroppable after replacing Kirby."

The match was postponed on Friday by the International Basketball Federation (Fiba) after an \u201cevaluation of the current security situation\u201d. The Netherlands\u2019 scheduled match against Russia, scheduled to take place on Saturday, was also pulled.\n\nOn Saturday, the Norwegian Ski Federation said it does not want Russian athletes competing at upcoming world cup races and world championships in Norway. Meanwhile the football associations of Poland and Sweden united in statements saying they refuse to play Russia in playoffs for the World Cup 2022.\nPatel, the UK\u2019s home secretary, tweeted: \u201cI have cancelled the visas of the Belarusian Men\u2019s Basketball Team who were due to play in Newcastle.\n\u201cThe UK will not welcome the national sports teams of those countries who are complicit in Putin\u2019s unprovoked and illegal invasion of Ukraine.\u201d\nBritain and Belarus had been due to play two matches \u2013 one in Minsk on Friday and the second at the Vertu Motors Arena, home to Newcastle Eagles, on Monday. Fiba first announced on Thursday that the Minsk game would be postponed before confirming the following day that the Newcastle game would also not go ahead. Following this latter decision it is understood that the Belarus team then cancelled their plans to travel to the UK.\nToni Minichiello, the interim chair of the British Basketball Federation (BBF), said in a statement: \u201cWe thank Fiba for all their help and for understanding our concerns about travelling to Minsk.\n\u201cI would also wish to take the opportunity thank the BBF Board, GB Team Staff and Players for coming together and presenting a unified position. The safety of our players and staff are and will always be our primary focus.\u201d\n\nElsewhere, Norway\u2019s skiiing federation said: \u201cRussia\u2019s violations of international law and attacks on the Ukrainian people demand international condemnation and sanctions. Sport is not detached from this and cannot remain passive to what is happening now.\n\u201cThe Norwegian Ski Federation\u2019s message to Russia and Russian athletes is crystal clear \u2013 we do not want your participation.\u201d\nNorway is scheduled to host events in Alpine skiing, cross country skiing, ski jumping and Nordic combined over the next few weeks. The federation added that it would follow up with the global body, the International Ski Federation (FIS).\n\nOn Friday FIS cancelled all remaining competitions of the 2021-22 season that were to be held in Russia but said Russian athletes can continue to participate in its competitions, in line with International Olympic Committee recommendations for international sports federations.\nWhile recommending that Russia\u2019s athletes be allowed to participate in events, the IOC urged federations to either move or cancel competitions currently planned in Russia or Belarus."

                    "body": "Rabbi Matondo describes missing out on a place in the Wales squad for the European Championship last summer as \u201cheartbreaking\u201d. The winger was overlooked after an underwhelming season and being sent home from a camp by the caretaker manager, Rob Page, for \u201cbreaching protocols\u201d a year ago. It was the end of a tough season for Matondo that started with an 8-0 defeat by Bayern Munich \u2013 one of only three Schalke appearances \u2013 and ended with a loan at Stoke. \u201cWhen you are growing up playing football you always dream about the big tournaments, like the Euros and World Cup,\u201d he says. \u201cBeing around the Wales team for the last two seasons consistently and then missing out on the most important camp was heartbreaking. \u201cDid I do enough throughout the season to get a chance? Probably not, but it hurt at the time. When you\u2019ve gone to previous camps and been there with the guys when we qualified for the Euros, missing out on the final step was a hard one to swallow. That gave me motivation and willpower to make sure something like that doesn\u2019t happen again. This season I am pushing myself.\u201d After an uncertain summer of injury and searching for a club, Matondo is firing with Cercle Brugge in the Belgian top flight, and is back in the Wales squad for their World Cup play-off at home to Austria on Thursday. Matondo has channelled his hurt to score nine goals in 24 games to help a club accustomed to relegation battles to mid-table safety and a fight for a place in Europe. The absence of Tyler Roberts and Kieffer Moore from the Wales squad means there is more pressure on Matondo, but he is thriving a year after his last Wales call-up was curtailed and left him with bridges to build.  \u201cI can\u2019t blame Rob Page for his decision; he made it on what he felt was right for the nation and what he wanted to do. He said what he needed to say, I said what I needed to say and at the end of the day he is the manager, he decides the team, he decides the squad and we move on. As much as I was upset, the team comes first. If the manager felt it was the right move for the squad, I guess it was. There wasn\u2019t much I could say \u2013 whatever I said wouldn\u2019t change his mind.\u201d Matondo\u2019s form in Belgium has been hard for Page to ignore. Cercle Brugge beat stiff competition from others in Europe to bring in the former Manchester City winger on loan from Schalke. The club have the youngest average age of any squad in Europe\u2019s top eight leagues as they look to create a springboard for players, led by a sporting director, Carlos Avi\u00f1a, who has overseen an overhaul at a club that shares an owner, the Russian Dmitry Rybolovlev, with Monaco. Club Brugge and Anderlecht are among the teams they have beaten this season. \u201cI was amazed by the faith showed in me by Cercle because other teams were maybe looking at me and thinking: \u2018Ermmm \u2026 he\u2019s injured and hasn\u2019t had the best of seasons before that, so it might be a risk getting him.\u2019 But the sporting director here was perfect with me. In getting me, he was a big factor, pushing me every step of the way to try to make this happen. In the end, it was the right move. \u201cMissing the Euros and being injured killed me a bit. That\u2019s why I felt it was really important when Cercle approached, showing that faith to give me that motivation to go into the next season, that when I get my opportunity, I stay fit, I stay out of trouble, I\u2019ll be firing for sure.\u201d The confidence is returning to a player who cost Schalke around \u00a311m as an 18-year-old in 2019. Things started promisingly in the Bundesliga for Matondo, who scored in a debut win against RB Leipzig, but a change of head coach and injuries stalled his progression in Germany and he was allowed to join Stoke in January 2021. Matondo admits he \u201cwas not at the races\u201d in his early Championship games as he recovered from injury but he ended his time in England in good form, and took that to Belgium after getting fit.  \u201cI have started 19, 20 games in the league. At the start I wasn\u2019t contributing with goals and assists but I was putting in some decent performances and they stuck with me and pushed me to play. Ultimately, when that first goal came the confidence started growing on the pitch. I have always believed in myself, given the opportunity, and when my confidence is there and I am playing regularly I can do my thing.\u201d Settling off the pitch has happened quickly, too, for Matondo, who is close friends at Cercle with the former Hull City midfielder Leonardo Lopes. \u201cIf I\u2019ve got a day off and we\u2019ve won or I\u2019ve scored, I feel I can treat myself to a little Belgian waffle \u2013 they\u2019re top notch.\u201d Wales fans will be hoping there is a need for a waffle in Cardiff on Friday morning."

                    "body": "West Ham will have to make do with competing on just the two fronts for the remainder of this season after Southampton advanced to the FA Cup quarter-finals at their expense. A trip to Seville in the Europa League next week and their tilt for a top-four berth in the Premier League will no doubt soften the disappointment of defeat here but there will be a lingering frustration for David Moyes given how his side allowed a game in their grasp to get away. Romain Perraud rocked West Ham with a phenomenal, rasping strike from outside the box \u2013 it was some way to open his account for the club \u2013 before the former Southampton loanee Michail Antonio levelled in the second half. But James Ward-Prowse restored the hosts\u2019 advantage with a no-nonsense penalty before the substitute Armando Broja secured passage into the next round, wriggling clear of three defenders before slotting home into the far corner. Moyes could not mask his mood afterwards. \u201cWe are lacking quality at the moment in the final third,\u201d the West Ham manager said. \u201cWe\u2019re pleased for Mich [Antonio] that he got a goal but we\u2019ve got other players that need to find some quality and start making the right decisions in the final third. I don\u2019t know how many times tonight we made the wrong choices in and around the box, and it cost us. Our finishing and final pass was so poor, so poor. It was disappointing.\u201d  It was a minor miracle that Southampton were not trailing when Perraud rifled his shot into the top corner beyond the West Ham goalkeeper Alphonse Areola, one of two changes. Kyle Walker-Peters shifted the ball across the field to the Frenchman, who took one touch before blasting a left-footed shot that flew in from 25 yards, whistling diagonally across the West Ham goal. Ralph Hasenh\u00fcttl, whose decision to make nine changes would be vindicated, jumped on to the pitch in celebration, while a clutch of Southampton substitutes stood to applaud. Stuart Armstrong, who arrived from the bench at the interval alongside Broja, hit a swerving strike from a similar distance against Coventry in the previous round. Hasenh\u00fcttl said both his voice and players needed to recover before visiting Aston Villa on Saturday. \u201cWhat a goal,\u201d he said. \u201cThe ball is a little bit lighter in the Cup so it is fantastic to shoot from outside [the box].\u201d For West Ham, a trip to Anfield is next in the calendar. Southampton could have doubled their advantage before the break but Adam Armstrong played a hospital pass to Will Smallbone, who tentatively joined the attack to the striker\u2019s right. In his technical area Moyes, arms folded, could be forgiven for wondering how his team had not taken the lead. Pablo Fornals, again operating from left wing-back, telegraphed a fine pass over the top of the Southampton back line to give Jarrod Bowen a sight of goal within the opening 67 seconds but Jack Stephens nicked the ball away to prevent the forward a shot at goal.  West Ham\u2019s best first-half opening came when Antonio, who won the Football League Trophy with Southampton in 2010, stood up a cross from the left, after Tomas Soucek and Fornals combined down the left. Bowen rose in the six-yard box but could not direct his header on target. Soucek was forced off early in the second half after requiring stitches for a stray elbow to the head but West Ham replied when Willy Caballero made a mess of a Bowen corner. The ball flew towards Kurt Zouma at the near post and Caballero failed to claim it, allowing Issa Diop to hook the ball towards Antonio, who fired in from close range to spark delirium among the almost 5,000-strong West Ham support in the Northam Stand. But the joy was short-lived. Five minutes later Stephens\u2019 quick free-kick exposed a gaping hole in the heart of the West Ham defence and Craig Dawson, in trouble when Broja beat him for pace, upended the striker. The referee, Andre Marriner, was advised to visit the VAR monitor and eventually awarded a penalty, which Ward-Prowse emphatically slammed down the middle. Dawson almost made amends but Caballero earned redemption, repelling the defender\u2019s header with a minute of normal time to play, before Broja sealed victory in the fifth minute of stoppage time."

                    "body": "There are videos of David Duckham out there, but not as many as you\u2019d hope. His twisting run past three All Blacks in that match against the Barbarians in \u201973 is online, so is his whirlwind sprint down the wing against Scotland in that year\u2019s Five Nations, in what they called the greatest try never scored at Twickenham (and there\u2019s a conversation), and his side-step around Roger Blyth to score the opener when England played Wales in \u201974. There\u2019s a sharp finish, \u201cone of his specials\u201d, for Coventry against London Scottish in the Cup final later that same year, and bits and pieces of his Lions tour to New Zealand in \u201971, when he scored 11 tries in 16 games. Nothing that I can find, though, of the one Duckham, who died last week aged 76, scored on debut against Ireland at Lansdowne Road in \u201969. \u201cDuckham at once fed Rod Webb, his friend on the wing, and then looped round him for the return pass and a glorious, glorious try in the corner,\u201d Frank Keating wrote in this paper a few years later. \u201cThe nation exalted, and the official history still calls it the most daring try of recent years.\u201d England\u2019s history, maybe, but the one that counts is written by the winners. Ireland edged it 17-15 and Duckham\u2019s try didn\u2019t make the edit in their documentary about the game. \u201cI suppose I should have dived to make it perfect,\u201d he said afterwards, \u201cbut the ground was hard and frosty.\u201d  It\u2019s not much, but enough just to give you an idea of what it was like to watch him in his pomp, \u201cfair-hair streaming like a pre-Raphaelite angel,\u201d Keating wrote, \u201cwinged boots always no more than an inch from the touchline till he ducked inside with no more than a shrug of his hip.\u201d Wales\u2019s Mervyn Davies said you felt like you ought to be able to tackle him. \u201cFrom 10 yards away his side-step looked obvious and predictable, but then when you were there in close-up it still left you stranded and leaden-footed.\u201d Of course Keating loved him: \u201cWhat swiftness of foot and thought, what panache, sheer enchantment.\u201d All the romantics did. Rugby does those split-second moments, when a player breaks the game open, and everything starts to unspool in fast forward, better than any other sport. Even when you\u2019re watching them back in crackly black-and-white. Duckham\u2019s feet seemed to move even before his thoughts had ordered them to. Duckham\u2019s trouble was there weren\u2019t too many cavaliers involved in the running of English rugby back then (or before or since). He only scored 10 tries in his 39 Tests. Read through the match reports, and often as not all the talk is about why England never managed to get more out of him. Keating went along to Coventry to watch his very last game, against Bristol, \u201cit goes without saying that he hardly got a pass worth the name\u201d. The roundheads said it was Duckham\u2019s fault that he wasn\u2019t more involved, that he ought to go looking for the ball more instead of brooding on the wing like some faraway guard watching over the distant border. Duckham knew it too. \u201cIn the early days with England there was a totally different attitude,\u201d he said. \u201cWe took far more risks. It was fun. We were allowed scope to dare and scope to enjoy ourselves, try things. Then attitudes changed. International rugby became too intense. You had to win. Everything was stamped with a no-risk policy.\u201d Switched from the centre to wing, from wing to centre, then back to the wing again, Duckham said he ended up becoming his own worst enemy. \u201cWith so few chances I was wondering all the time if I could still do it in internationals, still run with the ball, still beat a man with speed.\u201d  It was no surprise that he played his best Test rugby for the Lions and Barbarians, when he was under the great coach Carwyn James. \u201cThe boring unthinking coach continually preaches about mistakes,\u201d James once wrote in his Guardian column, \u201cadventure and error go together.\u201d There haven\u2019t been many England coaches, or captains for that matter, who were willing to make that wager. Much to Duckham\u2019s frustration. He was one of the loudest critics of the England team during the 1991 World Cup, when, in the days before the final, he said he would be \u201cembarrassed and very sad\u201d if they won it by playing the boring sort of game that got them there to begin with. History doesn\u2019t record how he felt about the fact that they listened to him (and everyone else who was giving them stick) and then went on to lose 12-6 to Australia while trying to play in an entirely new style. As Ben Stokes showed in the last year of cricket, the secret to playing the game like losing doesn\u2019t matter is in knowing when you really can\u2019t afford to. The most dogged innings Stokes played for England last year was the 52 he made off 49 balls when the T20 World Cup final was on the line. Like his skipper Jos Buttler said afterwards: \u201cIf he batted like that in a Test match he\u2019d drop himself.\u201d There\u2019s talk the England rugby team may start playing the same sort of carefree way themselves. Believe it when you see it. Till then, \u201cWe\u2019ll take the three, please, referee.\u201d"

In a Commons debate, Eustice also blamed Liz Truss, international trade secretary when negotiations opened, for the fact that the UK gave too much away. (See 6.03pm.)\n\n\nRishi Sunak has defended his deputy prime minister and justice secretary, Dominic Raab, saying he does not recognise claims from multiple civil servants that he bullied staff.\n\n\nBrexit is the ultimate reason why the UK now faces a fresh round of austerity, a former interest rate-setter at the Bank of England has said.\n\n\nUpdated at 6.24pm GMT\n\n\n 6.03pm  \nUK gave away 'far too much for far too little' in free trade deal with Australia, says George Eustice, blaming Liz Truss\n\nGeorge Eustice, the former environment secretary, has told MPs that the Commons that the free trade deal with Australia \u2013 hailed by Boris Johnson\u2019s government as one of the big trade gains from Brexit \u2013 was a poor deal for the UK.\nEustice, who was an enthusiastic Brexiter and was environment secretary while the deal was being negotiated, said the UK \u201cgave away far too much for far too little in return\u201d.\nSpeaking in a Commons debate on trade deals with Australia and New Zealand, Eustice, who was sacked by Liz Truss (international trade secretary when negotiations with Australia on the deal opened), said:\n\nThe first step is to recognise that the Australia trade deal is not actually a very good deal for the UK. It wasn\u2019t for lack of trying on my part. Indeed, there were things that we achieved: a special agricultural safeguard for years 10 to 15, staged liberalisation across the first decade, the protection of British sovereignty in SPS [sanitary and phytosanitary] issues.\nIt\u2019s no surprise that many of these areas were areas negotiated either exclusively or predominantly by Defra on behalf of the UK team.\nBut it has to be said that, overall the truth of the matter is that the UK gave away far too much for far too little in return.\n\nEustice said the UK gave too many concessions to Australian farmers. He said it was not necessary for the UK to give Australia (and New Zealand, in its deal) full liberalisation for beef and sheep, and he said \u201cneither Australia nor New Zealand had anything to offer in return for such a grand concession\u201d.\nEustice blamed Truss for what went wrong. He said:\n\nThe UK went into this negotiation holding the strongest hand, holding all of the best cards, but at some point in early summer 2021, the then trade secretary [Truss] took a decision to set an arbitrary target to conclude heads of terms by the time of the G7 summit, and from that moment the UK was on the back foot repeatedly.\nIn fact, at one point the then trade secretary asked her opposite number from Australia what he would need in order to be able to conclude an agreement by G7, and of course the Australian negotiator very kindly set out the Australian terms, which then shaped eventually the deal.\n\nEustice said that, as a backbencher, he no longer felt obliged to put a \u201cpositive gloss\u201d on what was achieved. He went on:\n\nUnless we recognise the failures that the Department for International Trade made during the Australia negotiations, we won\u2019t be able to learn the lessons of future negotiations.\n\nHe also said that, if necessary, the UK should be prepared to spend a decade negotiating joining the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP). The government should never again \u201cput ourselves in such a position of setting the clock against us and shattering our own negotiating position\u201d, he said.\nAnne-Marie Trevelyan was international trade secretary when the deal was signed in December last year. At the time she said the deal was \u201cjust the start as we get on the front foot and seize the seismic opportunities that await us on the world stage\u201d.\n\n\nUpdated at 6.24pm GMT\n\n\n 5.25pm  \nSturgeon says people should be 'profoundly concerned' by reports autumn statement will raise taxes for poorest\n\nNicola Sturgeon, Scotland\u2019s first minister, has said everyone should be \u201cprofoundly concerned\u201d by suggestions that the poor will have to pay more in tax as a result of the decisions in the autumn statement being unveiled on Thursday. On a visit to a school in Glasgow, she said:\n\nI think the hints that have been given in public in the media, by the chancellor, over the weekend should make everybody profoundly concerned.\nHe\u2019s talking about everybody having to pay more taxes, at a time when those at the lowest end of the income spectrum are already really struggling. If those tax increases fall there, that is of profound concern.\n\nShe also said there was a chance looming public sector cuts would cause \u201csignificant problems\u201d for services that are \u201cstill recovering not just from Covid but from the years of austerity that followed the last financial crash\u201d.\nBut Sturgeon did welcome the news that the website dealing with the Scottish government\u2019s Scottish child payment reportedly crashed temporarily this morning.\nThe value of the payment has gone up today from \u00a320 per week to \u00a325 per week, and the number of children eligible is being increased fourfold (from around 100,000 to around 400,00). Sturgeon said she was glad there was such a \u201cmassive demand\u201d for it.\n\n\nUpdated at 5.43pm GMT\n\n\n 5.06pm  \nRees-Mogg criticised for claiming UK could not have fully supported Ukraine without Brexit\n\nSupporters of Brexit seem to be finding it increasingly hard to point to benefits that Britain is enjoying from being outside the EU \u2013 or at least significant benefits, that outweigh the clear downsides. As my colleague Anna Isaac reports, Michael Saunders, a former member of the Bank of England\u2019s monetary policy committee, has said that, because of the damage it has done to the economy, \u201cif we hadn\u2019t had Brexit, we probably wouldn\u2019t be talking about an austerity budget this week\u201d.\n\nBut Jacob Rees-Mogg, the former business secretary and leading Brexiter, claims to have discovered a new benefit of Brexit. He says that, without Brexit, the UK would not have been able to support Ukraine to the extent that it did. He made the claim in an interview with GB News last night (where he implied Ukraine might have lost, without Brexit-enabled UK support), and he has restated his claim today.\n\nIn his interview Rees-Mogg was not asked to explain his reasoning, and it is hard to follow his reasoning. Members of the EU have considerable independence in defence and foreign policy matters, and many members are just as pro-Ukraine as the UK, or more so.\nEven Boris Johnson \u2013 who is fiercely proud of his record on Ukraine, and not shy of making bogus claims about the merits of Brexit \u2013 has not tried pursuing this argument.\nChris Bryant, a Labour former Europe minister, says Rees-Mogg\u2019s claim is a \u201cstraight lie\u201d.\n\n\nUpdated at 5.21pm GMT\n\n\n 4.24pm  \n\nAngela Rayner, the deputy Labour leader, has accused Rishi Sunak of \u201ccowering\u201d behind bullies. Responding to his comments defending Dominic Raab, Rayner said in a statement:\n\nIt is anti-bullying week, but instead of holding the bullies to account this prime minister is cowering behind them. Rishi Sunak clearly knew about Dominic Raab\u2019s reputation when he reappointed him to his cabinet.\nThe prime minister\u2019s promised appointment of an ethics watchdog is now long overdue leaving his pledge to bring integrity to his government lying in tatters. Just weeks after he was installed as prime minister there is already an overflowing in-tray of fresh accusations of ministerial misconduct.\n\n\nUpdated at 4.32pm GMT\n\n\n 4.19pm  \nBraverman tells MPs she is 'not going to overplay' significance of migrants deal with France\n\nIn the Commons Suella Braverman, the home secretary, said that the UK-France small boats agreement was \u201ca step forward\u201d \u2013 but stressed that she did not want to overstate its significance. She said:\n\nI\u2019m not going to overplay this agreement. It\u2019s a very important step forward, I think it provides a very good platform from which deeper collaboration can be secured \u2026\nIs it going to solve the problem on its own? It won\u2019t, but I do encourage everybody to support the deal we have secured.\n\nBraverman was replying to a question from Natalie Elphicke, the Tory MP for Dover. Echoing her criticism of the deal earlier on Twitter (see 2.44pm), Elphicke said that it fell short of what was needed and that the small boat arrivals were having a \u201cdreadful impact on local services\u201d in Kent.\n\n\nUpdated at 4.21pm GMT\n\n\n 4.03pm  \nUK to withdraw its peacekeeping force from Mali, defence minister tells MPs\n\nIn the Commons James Heappey, the armed forces minister, has just delivered a statement saying the UK is withdrawing its peacekeeping troops from the west African state of Mali.\nAs PA Media reports, the 300-strong UK contingent with the United Nations peacekeeping mission is to end its three-year deployment early. PA says:\n\nThe move comes after President Emmanuel Macron announced in February that French-led forces fighting jihadists in the region would be relocating from Mali to Niger.\nThe decisions reflect growing concern in western capitals that the military junta in Mali has increasingly aligned itself with the notorious Russian mercenary organisation - the Wagner Group.\n\nAfter Heappey delivered his statement, Sir Lindsay Hoyle, the Speaker, complained that the news had been leaked to the Times before it was announced to MPs.\n\nUpdated at 4.17pm GMT\n\n\n 3.48pm  \n\nDuring Home Office questions a Conservative MP said asylum seekers were being housed in a hotel in his constituency previously identified as a fire risk. Luke Evans, MP for Bosworth, said:\n\nI have a hotel in Earl Shilton that has twice been identified to try and deal with the backlog but failed due to health and safety concerns, particularly around fire. I was surprised when my constituents wrote to me saying they had seen asylum seekers in this hotel.\n\nEvans said the local councils and police had not been told about the placement, and he said it took him 72 hours to get the Home Office to confirm asylum seekers were being housed in the hotel.\nSuella Braverman said that \u201clocal partners\u201d should have been informed, but that \u201cdue to the incredible pressure on the system recently\u201d sometimes that did not happen.\n\nUpdated at 3.57pm GMT\n\n\n 3.41pm  \nLabour claims Nationality and Borders Act 'adding further delays' to processing of asylum claims\n\nDuring Home Office questions in the Commons Stephen Kinnock, the shadow immigration minister, claimed a law passed by the government was contributing to the delay in processing asylum claims.\nKinnock said:\n\nThe Nationality and Borders Act establishes a new category of asylum seekers whom the government claims are not permitted to claim asylum in Britain and who should therefore be removed.\nBut, because they have failed to agree a returns agreement with France and because the Rwanda policy is completely unworkable, 16,000 people in this category have been stuck in limbo waiting an additional six months for a decision at huge cost to the British taxpayer.\nOf those 16,000 who are in limbo, only 21 have been returned since the act came into force.\nDo ministers therefore accept that their own legislation is adding further delays, cost, chaos and confusion to an already broken system, whilst doing next to nothing to remove failed asylum seekers who have no right to be here?\n\nIn response, Suella Braverman, the home secretary, said Labour was not offering any solutions. She told Kinnock:\n\nI find it staggering, frankly, that Labour seem to love complaining about the system, but when we introduce laws to fix it, what did they do? They opposed every step of the way.\nWe wanted to make it easier to deport foreign national offenders, Labour voted against it. We wanted to fix our asylum system, Labour voted against it. We secured a groundbreaking agreement with Rwanda, Labour would scrap it. Labour are very, very, very good at complaining, they have absolutely no solution at all.\n\n\nUpdated at 3.46pm GMT\n\n\n 3.33pm  \nUK announces further sanctions against Iranian officials over repression of protests\n\nThe UK, with foriegn allies, is imposing fresh sanctions on Iranian officials, in response to the repression of protests in the country, the Foreign Office has announced.\nJames Cleverly, the foreign secretary, said:\n\nThese sanctions target officials within the Iranian regime who are responsible for heinous human rights violations.\nTogether with our partners, we have sent a clear message to the Iranian regime - the violent crackdown on protests must stop and freedom of expression must be respected.\nThe Iranian people could not be clearer. It\u2019s time for the regime to stop blaming external actors and start listening to the voices of their people.\n\n\n\n\n 3.26pm  \n\nWhen Rishi Sunak met his Canadian counterpart, Justin Trudeau, at the G20 summit in Bali, the pair enjoyed drinks and snacks at the Bumbu Bali arts cafe, with Trudeau choosing a Bintang beer and teetotal Sunak ordering a mango spritz, PA Media reports. PA says:\n\nSunak asked his Canadian counterpart about his Asean visit, saying he was interested because the UK now has an Indo-Pacific tilt to its foreign policy.\nThe leaders also talked about the UK\u2019s potential accession to the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) trade pact, which would allow Britain to work more closely with Pacific rim economies.\n\n\n\nUpdated at 3.29pm GMT\n\n\n 2.57pm  \nJohnson makes rare appearance at departmental questions in Commons, campaigning to save Uxbridge police station\n\nIn House of Commons Suella Braverman, the home secretary, is taking questions, and she has just responded to a question from Boris Johnson. The former prime minister has not been a regular contributor to the Commons since he stood down, and he almost never attends departmental questions, but he intervened on the topic of policing in London. After praising the record of his own government on police recruitment, he asked Braverman if she agreed that Uxbridge police station should remain open.\nJohnson is MP for Uxbridge and South Ruislip. It is not a place he has mentioned often in the Commons in recent years, but perhaps he is less busy now than he used to be, and he may have noticed that, despite having a majority of 7,210, some recent polling implies he could lose his seat if Labour maintains its big lead.\nThis is from Mail Online\u2019s David Wilcock.\n\nIn response, Braverman praised Johnson and claimed his record on crime was better than his successor, Sadiq Khan\u2019s. But she did not say anything about the Uxbridge police station.\nUPDATE: My colleague Pippa Crerar says this is only the fourth time Johnson has mentioned Uxbridge in the Commons since he became its MP.\n\n\nUpdated at 4.31pm GMT\n\n\n 2.44pm  \nTory MP for Dover Natalie Elphicke says UK-France small boats deal 'falls short of what's needed'\n\nNatalie Elphicke, the Conservative MP for Dover, says the UK-France small boats deal announced today \u201cfalls short of what\u2019s needed\u201d.\n\n\n\nUpdated at 2.48pm GMT\n\n\n 2.39pm  \nStarmer says UK-France migrants deal 'small step in right direction', but says Tories created problem in first place\n\nKeir Starmer has described the UK-France small boats deal as \u201ca small step in the right direction\u201d. Speaking on a visit to Milton Keynes in Buckinghamshire, he said:\n\nMost people will look at this and say, look, there\u2019s more taxpayers\u2019 cash now being spent on a problem of the government\u2019s making.\nThis has been going on a very, very long time. And the home secretary has said that the asylum system is broken. She\u2019s right about that \u2013 they broke it.\nA small step in the right direction. But a much bigger challenge that the government still isn\u2019t gripping.\n\n\n\nUpdated at 2.47pm GMT\n\n\n 2.34pm  \n\nDominic Raab\u2019s allies are saying that they do not accept Simon McDonald\u2019s comments about his behaviour at the Foreign Office (see 2pm), and suggesting that some his officials deserved criticism because their work wasn\u2019t up to scratch, my colleague Pippa Crerar reports.\n\n\n\n\n 2.27pm  \nShapps says post-Brexit replacement of EU's product safety marking being delayed for two years to cut costs for business\n\nGrant Shapps, the business secretary, has announced that the government is delaying by two years the point by which companies have to stop using the EU\u2019s CE product safety marking and use the new British version, UKCA, instead.\nThe CE marking was supposed to be phased for British regulatory purposes in December this year, but Shapps says it will continue to be recognised for another two years.\nIn a statement in his department\u2019s news release, Shapps depicts the delay as a pro-growth measure \u2013 implicitly accepting that the post-Brexit move away from CE marking is imposing a cost on business. Shapps says:\n\nThe government is determined to remove barriers to businesses so they can get on with their top priorities, like providing quality customer service, enabling growth and supporting their staff.\nThis move will give businesses the breathing space and flexibility they need at this crucial time and ensure that our future system for product safety marking is fit for purpose, providing the highest standard for consumers without harming businesses.\n\n\n\n\n\n 2.02pm  \n\n\n\n\n\n 2.00pm  \nFormer Foreign Office chief says he's not surprised other officials viewed Raab as bully\n\nSimon McDonald was head of the Foreign Office when Dominic Raab was foreign secretary. In an interview for Andrew Marr\u2019s LBC show at 6pm this evening, McDonald said that Raab was a tough boss, and that he is not surprised other officials viewed him as a bully. These are from LBC\u2019s Matthew Harris.\n\n\n\n\nMcDonald was the former permanent secretary who triggered the downfall of Boris Johnson when he revealed that No 10 was not telling the truth about Johnson being aware of specific allegations about Chris Pincher. Two days later Johnson announced his resignation.\nRetired civil servants do not normally intervene in political controversies quite this bluntly, and McDonald\u2019s decision to denounce Johnson was seen as revenge for the way he was forced to retire. But it was reported that McDonald only went public after his private advice to No 10 that it needed to change its story about Pincher, because the public were being misled, was ignored.\n\nUpdated at 2.05pm GMT\n\n\n 1.26pm  \nSunak says he's confident Channel crossing numbers can be cut - but won't say when, and stresses France deal 'just a start'\n\nHere are the main points from Rishi Sunak\u2019s pooled broadcast interview with Sky\u2019s Beth Rigby.\n\nSunak said he was confident that asylum seeker number could be reduced, but refused to say it would happen next year as a result of the deal with France. Asked if he could guarantee that the number of people crossing the Channel in small boats would fall from this year\u2019s record high, more than 40,000 (see 9.45am), as a result of the deal, Sunak at first refused to answer the question. Pressed again on whether numbers would fall next year, he replied:\n\n\nI\u2019m confident that we can get the numbers down, but I also want to be honest with people that it isn\u2019t a single thing that will magically solve this. We can\u2019t do it overnight.\nPeople should be absolutely reassured that this is a top priority for me. I\u2019m gripping it and, as I\u2019ve said, in the time that I\u2019ve been prime minister, you\u2019re already starting to see some progress with this deal with the French.\nBut that\u2019s just a start. There\u2019s lots more that we need to do.\n\n\nHe declined to say that the tax rises or spending cuts in the autumn statement on Thursday would be worse because of Liz Truss\u2019s mini-budget. Asked if the government was having to make \u201charder choices\u201d because of Truss, Sunak at first stressed the impact of global factors, like Covid and the war in Ukraine. When pressed again, he replied:\n\n\nOn the steps of Downing Street I said that mistakes had been made. And part of the reason that I became prime minister was to address them and what we\u2019ve seen now is that stability has returned to the United Kingdom.\n\nKwasi Kwarteng, Truss\u2019s chancellor at the time of the mini-budget, argues that because the mistakes in the mini-budget have been mostly reversed, it can\u2019t be blamed for the public finances being in a worse state than they otherwise would have been. Jeremy Hunt, the current chancellor, has implied he does not accept this. Sunak is saying Truss made mistakes, but he seems reluctant to say that she caused long-term damage to the national finances.\n\nSunak claimed that \u201cfairness and compassion\u201d would be at the heart of the autumn statement.\n\n\nHe stressed the importance of working constructively with other countries, citing migration, and the deal with France, as an example of why they could help the UK. He said:\n\n\nWe should make our voices heard and constructively work with people where we can to make a difference for people at home as well. And you saw that recently when it comes to migration, the ability to talk to other countries can have benefits for people at home, and that\u2019s what I\u2019m here to do.\n\nSunak was explaining why it was important to attend the G20 summit, even though G20 countries do not all agree on Ukraine. (See 12.45pm.) His comment might seem like a statement of the obvious, but he does also seem keen to make the point that, after Boris Johnson and Liz Truss, the UK is now being led by someone less antagonistic towards foreigners.\n\nUpdated at 1.29pm GMT\n\n\n 12.45pm  \n\nRishi Sunak has recorded a pooled interview with Beth Rigby from Sky News. As she reports, Sunak insisted that it was right for him to attend the G20 summit even if, as a group, it does not issue a joint condemnation of Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine.\n\nRussia is a member of the G20, which is one reason why there won\u2019t be a joint communique condemning the invasion. But some other G20 members have been unwilling to criticise Vladimir Putin over Ukraine too.\n\nUpdated at 1.28pm GMT\n\n\n 12.39pm  \n\nHere are some more pictures of Rishi Sunak arriving in Bali, where he is attending the G20 summit.\n\n\n\n\n\n 12.32pm  \nNo 10 refuses to deny concern expressed about Raab's conduct towards staff when he was Brexit secretary\n\nAs my colleague Pippa Crerar reports, at the lobby briefing Downing Street also refused to deny a report in the Observer that a \u201cserious expression of concern\u201d about Dominic Raab\u2019s conduct towards staff was sent to the Cabinet Office when he was Brexit secretary.\n\n\n\n\n 12.25pm  \nNo 10 refuses to say it is confident UK-France migrants deal will bring number of small boat Channel crossings down\n\nAt the Downing Street lobby briefing the prime minister\u2019s spokesperson confirmed that there are no targets attached to the UK-France asylum deal for how it should reduce small boat Channel crossings. Echoing the stance taken by James Cleverly this morning (see 9.23am), No 10 won\u2019t even say it is confident the deal will bring numbers down. This is from Lucy Fisher from Times Radio.\n\nI will post more from the lobby briefing shortly.\n\n\n\n 12.17pm  \nSunak says he does \u2018not recognise\u2019 bullying claims against Raab\n\nRishi Sunak has defended his deputy prime minister and justice secretary, Dominic Raab, saying he does not recognise claims from multiple civil servants that he bullied staff. Speaking to journalists on his flight to Bali following my colleague Pippa Crerar\u2019s revelation on Friday night that staff in Raab\u2019s office at the MoJ were offered the chance to move because some were still traumatised by the experience of working for him when he was last there, Sunak said he did not recognise that description of Raab. He said:\n\nI don\u2019t recognise that characterisation of Dominic and I\u2019m not aware of any formal complaints about him.\nOf course, there are established procedures for civil servants if they want to bring to light any issues. I\u2019m not aware of any formal complaint about Dominic.\n\nMy colleague Jessica Elgot has the full story here.\n\n\nUpdated at 12.30pm GMT\n\n\n 12.08pm  \n\nThe SNP has also criticised the UK-France small boats deal, saying there should be \u201cmany more\u201d safe and legal routes for people seeking asylum in the UK. This is from Anne McLauglin MP, the SNP\u2019s immigration spokesperson.\n\nWhile co-operation with the French is welcome, no deal will fix the Tories disastrous asylum system. With independence, Scotland can rid ourselves of callous Tory policies and create a humane migration system that works for us.\nWe have seen deals like this before and they have failed to significantly improve the situation. The UK government must instead focus on creating more safe and legal routes, which we know work, and address the backlog of asylum decisions.\nThe whole UK asylum system needs root and branch reform to make it humane and fit for purpose, including giving asylum seekers the right to work, creating many more safe and legal routes, and providing decent accommodation and support systems for those seeking safety upon arrival.\nBut more immediately, the 10,000 asylum seekers who have been waiting for a decision for three years or more deserve an answer. These people should have already had their decision by now and could be working, paying tax and contributing to our society. The money the UK government is using to pay the French for border control would be better spent on hiring and training more Home Office staff to get through the backlog.\n\n\n\n\n 12.02pm  \nLabour dismisses UK-France deal to curb Channel migration as too little, too late\n\nLabour is dismissing the UK-France small boats deal as too little, too late. This is what Yvette Cooper, the shadow home secretary, posted about it on Twitter last night.\n\nUPDATE: Stephen Kinnock, the shadow immigration minister, delivered the same critique in an interview with Sky News this morning.\n\n\nUpdated at 12.49pm GMT\n\n\n 11.58am  \n\n\n\n\n\n 11.55am  \n\nAs my colleagues Aletha Adu, Pippa Crerar and Jessica Elgot report, senior Labour figures have said that Jeremy Corbyn will never be permitted to stand again as a candidate for the party at a general election.\n\nMomentum, the Labour group set up when Corbyn was leader to promote him and his agenda, has described this stance as \u201cdisgraceful\u201d.\n\nAs our report explains, if Corbyn ends up running for parliament as a non-Labour candidate at the next election, Momentum will not be able to support him without becoming a banned organisation within the party. Adu, Crerar and Elgot report:\n\nShould Corbyn decide to run at the next election as an independent, it would pose a potentially existential dilemma for Momentum, the grassroots leftwing group that emerged out of Corbyn\u2019s leadership campaign, which has become a pressure group for the Labour left and the loudest critic of Starmer\u2019s leadership.\nSenior Labour sources have made it clear that should Momentum campaign for Corbyn, it would be proscribed as an organisation by Labour \u2013 similar to the way Militant or other leftwing groups that challenged Labour MPs have been treated.\n\n\n\n\n 11.38am  \n\nRishi Sunak has touched down on the tropical island of Bali ahead of the G20 summit, PA Media reports. PA says:\n\nAs the prime minister stepped out of the plane and into the evening humidity, he was met by a guard of honour and a troupe of dancers on the tarmac.\nSunak looked on and smiled as the group performed a spectacular traditional Balinese dance called \u201cpendet\u201d, carrying bowls of flower petals as their gold headdresses gleamed in the airport floodlights.\nThe prime minister arrived in Bali after a long-haul flight evening, ahead of the two-day summit\u2019s kick off the next morning.\n\n\nUpdated at 11.58am GMT\n\n\n 11.26am  \n\nJames Cleverly, the foreign secretary, was criticised last month for saying that gay football fans visiting Qatar for the Word Cup should \u201cbe respectful\u201d, and make allowance for the country\u2019s intolerance of homosexuality.\nIn an interview on ITV\u2019s Good Morning Britain, Cleverly defended his comments, saying that the Foreign Office always advises people to obey local laws when they are travelling. He told the programme:\n\nMy focus is to make sure that British visitors, particularly LGBTQ+ visitors to Qatar going to enjoy the World Cup, are safe and that they enjoy their tournament. So my advice was purely about ensuring that they have a safe and secure time at the World Cup.\nWe always say that you have to respect the laws of your host nation. That is a universal element of British travel advice.\n\nAsked if gay football fans should refrain from holding hands while there, he said he wanted to ensure fans were safe. He said:\n\nI\u2019ve spoken at length with the Qatari authorities on this and it\u2019s worth bearing in mind that men and women don\u2019t typically hold hands in Qatar, and other conservative Muslim countries like Qatar, so my strong advice is to look at the UK government\u2019s travel advice.\n\n\nUpdated at 11.32am GMT\n\n\n 11.14am  \n\nAmnesty International UK has also criticised today\u2019s UK-France small boats deal, saying it just another version of a \u201cfailed response\u2019 that has not work. The charity\u2019s refugee and migrant rights director, Steve Valdez-Symonds, said: \n\nThis deal is just the same as previous deals - spending money and resources on intercepting and obstructing people crossing the Channel, while doing nothing to address their need for safe access to an asylum system.\nThe inevitable result will be more dangerous journeys and more profits led by ruthless smuggling gangs and other serious criminals exploiting the refusal of the UK and French government to take and share responsibility.\nPerpetuating this dreadful human suffering by recycling the same failed response to punish and deter desperate people in miserable and unsafe conditions has become mindless to the point of cruelty.\nUnless the UK government accepts its share of people into its asylum system, particularly people with family and connections in the UK, there seems little prospect that anything is going to change, let alone improve.\n\n\n\n\n 11.08am  \nSadiq Khan dismisses UK-France small boats deal as 'red meat' for public that does not address cause of problem\n\nSadiq Khan, the Labour mayor of London, has dismissed the UK-France small boats deal as \u201cred meat\u201d for the public that does not address cause of the problem. He told Times Radio:\n\nMy concern is what the government\u2019s doing today is sort of throwing some red meat to people who are concerned about migration and not addressing the core issue we\u2019ve had over the last 11 months, 40,000 people crossing the Channel in little boats.\nSo this tough rhetoric clearly isn\u2019t working by itself.\nYou\u2019ve got to have close relations with France, colleagues in the European Union, with countries in north Africa, you\u2019ve got to deal at source with those people who are playing on the misery of asylum seekers and refugees in relation to charging them a fortune.\n\n\nUpdated at 11.11am GMT\n\n\n 10.50am  \nCleverly claims most people trying to get to UK in small boats are economic migrants\n\nIn an article in the Sunday Telegraph yesterday Robert Jenrick, the immigration minister, said that asylum seekers should not be staying in luxury hotels. Echoing comments made by his boss, Suella Braverman, the home secretary, who recently complained about migrants being housed in four-star hotels, Jenrick said:\n\nHuman decency has to be accompanied by hard-headed common sense: illegal immigrants are not entitled to luxury hotels. Conditions in the UK are almost always better than in neighbouring countries, which helps explain why the UK is a destination of choice for economic migrants on the continent \u201casylum shopping\u201d. \n\u201cHotel Britain\u201d must end, and be replaced with simple, functional accommodation that does not create an additional pull factor.\n\nIn an interview this morning James Cleverly, the foreign secretary, defended Jenrick\u2019s comments, saying it was important to reduce the \u201cpull factor\u201d that made the UK attractive to economic migrants. He also claimed that most people trying to get to the UK were economic migrants. He told BBC Breakfast:\n\nMany of the people, the bulk of people attempting to get to the UK, are economic migrants rather than fleeing persecution or war. They are seeking a better life. I get that, I understand that, the UK is a wonderful place to live.\nBut it is because they perceive the UK to be a very generous country, that is part of the pull factor.\n\nRecent Home Office figures undermine claims that most of those crossing the Channel in small boats are economic migrants, rather than people with a genuine reason to seek asylum. Of the asylum cases that were decided in the year ending in June 2022, 76% initial decisions resulted in asylum, or an alternative form of leave to remain, being granted. That is the highest figure since 1990, when 82% of initial applications were granted. \n\n\n\n 10.27am  \nFifth of hospitality firms have cut trading hours to save energy costs, ONS says\n\nOver a fifth of hospitality firms have cut their hours over the past three months in a bid to cut energy costs, the Office for National Statistics has revealed.\nThe ONS has released a report saying food and drink service firms, such as pubs, restaurants and bars, are more likely than firms in any other sector to cut trading to deal with mammoth increases in energy bills.\nIt says 21% of firms in the sector have cut their trading hours as a result, even if they are still operating for the same number of days.\nMeanwhile, 6% of businesses in the sector say they have cut trading by two or more days a week over the past three months.\n\n\nUpdated at 10.35am GMT\n\n\n 9.50am  \n\nSuella Braverman has been tweeting about the new small boats deal with the French.\n\n\nAnd these are from her French opposite number, G\u00e9rald Darminin.\n\n\n\n\n\n 9.45am  \n\nSome 853 people were detected crossing the English Channel in small boats on Sunday, the Ministry of Defence said. It follows 972 crossings on Saturday.\nAs PA Media reports, the cumulative number of crossings this year now stands at a provisional total of 41,738. \nTotal crossings last year were 28,526.\nThere were 26 boats detected on Sunday, which suggests an average of around 33 people crossed the Channel per boat.\n\nUpdated at 10.18am GMT\n\n\n 9.43am  \n\nLucy Moreton, an official with the ISU, the union for borders, immigration and customs staff, told Times Radio the new UK-France deal on asylum seekers would not address the core problem.\nShe said that interrupting migrants to \u201cjust let them go to try again\u201d would not have the required impact and nothing in the deal suggested that \u201cthe French are going to move away from that position\u201d. She went on:\n\nThe sticking points just simply have not been addressed.\n\nAs PA Media reports, the ISU professional officer added that intercepting migrants so they do not try to get to the UK again was not something the French \u201chave ever wanted to do\u201d, as from the French perspective \u201cthey are going the right way and it\u2019s entirely understandable that they are not very keen to interrupt that\u201d.\nShe said the UK needed to deal with the issue itself by resourcing \u201cthe court system far better than it has been\u201d in order to process claims in a shorter space of time.\nAs my colleague Rajeev Syal reports, more than 40,000 people seeking asylum in the UK have waited between one and three years for a decision on their claim, new figures show.\n\n\nUpdated at 9.55am GMT\n\n\n 9.31am  \n\nSuella Braverman, the home secretary, has signed the new UK-France agreement on Channel crossings with her French counterpart, G\u00e9rald Darmanin, this morning. She said that it wasn\u2019t a quick fix, but that it would lead to a significant increase in the number of French officers patrolling beaches. She said:\n\nWe must do everything we can to stop people making these dangerous journeys and crack down on the criminal gangs.\nThis is a global challenge requiring global solutions, and it is in the interests of both the UK and French governments to work together to solve this complex problem.\nThere are no quick fixes but this new arrangement will mean we can significantly increase the number of French gendarmes patrolling the beaches in northern France and ensure UK and French officers are working hand in hand to stop the people smugglers.\n\n\n\n\n\n 9.23am  \nJames Cleverly refuses to say how UK-France deal on asylum seekers will affect numbers crossing Channel\n\nRishi Sunak will be arriving in Bali later for the G20 summit, but he has been speaking to the journalists travelling with him on his plane about a deal announced this morning with France, to increase cooperation on tackling people using small boats to cross the Channel. Here is our story, by my colleagues Jessica Elgot (who is with Sunak) and Peter Walker.\n\nSunak told reporters there was no \u201csingle thing\u201d that would solve the small boats problem, but he said he was \u201cconfident we can bring the numbers down over time\u201d.\nBut the government won\u2019t say what difference it expects the deal with the French announced today to make. James Cleverly, the foreign secretary, has been giving interviews this morning and he has been dodging questions on this point. On the Today programme he said that cooperation with the French was already making a difference and that 29,000 people had been stopped from getting to the UK this year \u2013 almost twice as many as in previous years. But when Today\u2019s Mishal Husain asked him what impact the new agreement was likely to have on the number of crossings (\u201cI\u2019m sure that you have a way of measuring that,\u201d she said, optimistically), Cleverly declined to give a figure. He replied:\n\nIt\u2019s really important you understand that we are we are dealing with an evolving situation \u2026 It\u2019s very, very difficult to predict exact numbers. It depends on so many variables, but the important thing is that we are working more closely [with the French] \u2026. more French officers on the beaches as a direct result of the agreement that the home secretary and the French interior minister have signed today.\n\n\nI will post more from his interviews shortly.\nHere is the agenda for the day.\n11.30am: Downing Street holds a lobby briefing.\n12.45pm: Michael Gove, the levelling up secretary, gives the keynote speech at the Centre for Policy Studies Margaret Thatcher Conference on Growth.\n2.30pm: Home Office questions in the Commons.\n4pm: James Cleverly, the foreign secretary, gives evidence to the Commons foreign affairs committee.\ntry to monitor the comments below the line (BTL) but it is impossible to read them all. If you have a direct question, do include \u201cAndrew\u201d in it somewhere and I\u2019m more likely to find it. I do try to answer questions and, if they are of general interest, I will post the question and reply above the line (ATL), although I can\u2019t promise to do this for everyone.\nIf you want to attract my attention quickly, it is probably better to use Twitter.

                    "body": "Josef Kordik was sitting in a cafe in Kyiv when a bedraggled man on the street caught his eye. That, he was sure, was Myklova Trusevych, the great Dynamo goalkeeper. He rushed outside. It was spring 1942, a few months after the city had fallen to the Nazis. Kordik was a Moravian who had been left behind after fighting for Austria-Hungary in the first world war. He had not enjoyed his new life and watching football had been his only joy, but the occupation had meant opportunity. He had falsely claimed Volksdeutsch status and been installed as manager of Bakery Number 1. But for most people occupation had brought suffering. Trusevych had sent his wife, who was Jewish, to Odesa to escape the fighting. His home had been destroyed and he was sleeping rough. Kordik offered him work and accommodation at the bakery. Other stricken Dynamo players joined him. When regular football was established as a way of normalising the occupation, the bakery set up a team and proved themselves the best side in the city.  They played the Luftwaffe team and beat them 5-1. Three days later, on 9 August, they played them again, winning 5-3 in what became known as the Death Match. No game has ever been so shrouded in myth. In the years immediately after the war, it was in effect hushed up. Should Kyivans really have been playing football with the occupiers? After all, one player was sentenced to five years in the gulag for collaboration while another had emigrated to Canada; by definition, they were not good Soviets. But by the Brezhnev era their victory was celebrated: brave Communists offering hope to the people of Kyiv by beating the Nazis. Details accrued, from the plausible \u2013 an SS officer had warned them not to win \u2013 to the absurd \u2013 the players were shot at during the second half. The bare facts are tragic enough. Around 10 days after the game, the players were arrested, seemingly because, having played for Dynamo, the team of the interior ministry, they were technically members of the NKVD, the Soviet secret police. One, Mykola Korotkykh, had briefly been an active officer and died under torture. The others were sent to a camp near Babyn Yar, a ravine in Kyiv that was the site of a Nazi massacre of Jews in 1941. On 24 February 1943, in reprisal for bomb attacks marking the anniversary of the foundation of the Red Army, one in three prisoners were murdered. Oleksiy Klymenko and Ivan Kuzmenko, both of whom had scored against the Luftwaffe, were killed that morning, along with Trusevych. It is a story that has particular resonance in the present context of Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine but its significance is complex. The term sportswashing may have existed for half a dozen years and the modern practice of states or oligarchs taking control of clubs has taken it into a new phase, but football has had soft-power potential since it became a mass preoccupation in the late 19th century.  That can be manipulated, but football is as much a theatre as it is a tool: its soft-power potential is not easily wielded. As the Death Match shows, events are open to multiple interpretations: what one generation feared as collaboration the next saw as heroism; when, in 1971, a memorial was erected to the four players who were killed, it was opposed by the KGB. New meanings are still being teased out of the legend: in Match, a 2012 film about the game directed by Andrey Malyukov, the heroes are Russian\u2011speaking Communists while those who work with the Nazis speak Ukrainian. Football, hostage as it may now be to finance, has a mischievous tendency to confound the best-laid plans: Paris Saint-Germain and Manchester City, for all their investment, have still not won the Champions League, while Chelsea won it for the first time with an interim manager and probably the worst squad they have had since Roman Abramovich\u2019s arrival.  It is 17 years since CSKA Moscow, the former army club, became the first Russian side to win a European trophy. At the time, it was still partly owned by the Russian Ministry of Defence and was sponsored by Sibneft, a corporation owned by Abramovich, although he was bought out by Gazprom a few months later. The Ministry of Defence sold its remaining 25% stake to Bluecastle Enterprises, a company registered in London. The remaining 75% is held by the state development corporation VEB.RF whose chairman, Igor Shuvalov, was sanctioned by the UK on Thursday. Bluecastle, run by CSKA\u2019s president, Evgeny Giner, continues to operate freely. Three years after CSKA\u2019s success, Zenit St Petersburg, who have been owned by Gazprom since December 2005, won the Uefa Cup. Russian football seemed on the verge of an era of great success, but the league is now ranked 10th in Europe, behind Scotland. There was perhaps a natural ceiling to Russia\u2019s challenge to the big four or five leagues and limits on foreign players have raised domestic salaries more than quality, but interest has waned since the World Cup and sanctions imposed after the invasion of Crimea in 2014 have had an impact, with Giner\u2019s energy business particularly badly hit. Then there are the indirect consequences of involvement in football. The United Arab Emirates and Saudi takeovers of Manchester City and Newcastle have led to far greater scrutiny in Britain of those countries\u2019 human rights records than would otherwise have been the case. Such investment is seemingly still regarded as a net positive, but there have been costs. Who would have considered the rights of migrant labourers in Qatar before it bid to host a World Cup?  The irony of this is that for all Russia\u2019s efforts, most particularly by hosting the World Cup and the Winter Olympics, to use sport as a propaganda tool, it is sport that, before the war, provided probably the most visible examples of Ukraine\u2019s existence. Until Volodymyr Zelenskiy emerged as a hero of resistance, the most famous Ukrainians to the rest of the world were sportsmen, Vitali Klitschko and Andriy Shevchenko. Anybody who followed the Champions League knew Shakhtar and Dynamo. The same soft power Russia tried to exploit also gave Ukraine an identity. In the information war, that is no small matter."

Despite their recent revival under Frank Lampard, FLE are still moob-deep in a relegation battle with two games to go. It\u2019s survival of the fittest: on Sunday, one of FLE, Leeds and Burnley will be bundled through the Premier League trapdoor with only a gold-encrusted parachute for company. The good news for FLE is that they will be mathematically safe if they beat Crystal Palace at Goodison Park on Thursday. The bad news is that, if they don\u2019t, they will have to get something away to Arsenal on the final day to guarantee safety. \u201cAway\u201d is the operative word: Everton have taken only 10 points on the road all season.

And we shouldn\u2019t understate that. It won\u2019t be cause for huge celebrations if we get the right result [yes it bloody will \u2013 Fiver Ed] but \u2026 we have to understand what a big night that could be for the club. The size of this game can\u2019t be lost on anyone.\u201d It\u2019s certainly not lost on The Fiver, although sadly we won\u2019t be watching the games. Football on a Thursday?

FIVER LETTERS \u201cO\u2019Rangers\u2019 visit to Seville reminded me of a story about the last time they reached a final abroad, in 1972. After the match in Barcelona, there were so many fans worse for wear in the city centre that the police just rounded them up, took them to the airport and packed them on to waiting charter flights, without checking any tickets. This was all well and good, except for a group of men who gradually sobered up during the flight home, and then remembered that they had driven to the match\u201d \u2013 Geoff Coxon. \u201cIt appears that Divock Origi will be joining Milan from Liverpool.

                    "body": "  4.21pm    Thank you very much for joining me. Here is Simon Mail\u2019s report from Spurs \u2026   Updated at 4.23pm GMT    4.10pm    Spurs failed to have a shot on target in the second half, which sums it up nicely.      4.00pm    \u201cWill, on a positive note the quality of entertainment can only go up from here. Right? Please.\u201d There is always hope Mary Waltz.      3.59pm    \u201cHow much longer before Harry Kane demands a transfer?\u201d asks Mike Mackenzie. He might not be too keen on staying on under Conte next season \u2026   Updated at 4.01pm GMT    3.57pm    Spurs just could not create anything of note. It was a submissive display from them. They need Bentancur, Kulusevski and Richarlison back soon.      3.56pm    There was quality in the assists for the two goals from Villa. Watkins did supremely well to beat Lloris to the ball and set up Buendia and the McGinn pass for Douglas Luiz was excellent.      3.55pm   Full-time: Tottenham 0-2 Aston Villa  Villa executed Emery\u2019s game plan perfectly, biding their time to get the opener and then controlling the game. Spurs were awful.   Updated at 3.58pm GMT    3.54pm    90+6 mins: Villa look far more like scoring a third than Spurs do of pulling one back. Watkins heads a corner over the bar to prove my point.      3.52pm    90+4 mins: Chambers is mainly on the pitch to foul Son and is booked after a couple in quick succession. Whatever keeps Spurs out of the Villa half, I guess.      3.50pm    90+2 mins: The crowd and team have been flat today. No one even cares there are seven minutes left to score twice in.     3.48pm    90 mins: Timewasting and what not mean we will endure seven more minutes of this.   Updated at 3.52pm GMT    3.46pm    88 mins: Son cuts in and whacks a shot at goal but Bednarek stops it before it can trouble Olsen.  Skipp and Spence are coming on for Hojbjerg and Perisic. Not sure what these two can offer.      3.44pm    86 mins: Spurs have been pretty awful overall. Limited creativity. They are missing some of their more creative players but they should be doing better than this.  Romero absolutely smashes into Coutinho on the touchline for no reason whatsoever and should receive a second booking but a throw-in is awarded instead. How odd. \u201cKulusevski is the only Spurs player that consistently provides offensive spark,\u201d suggests Jim Boyd. \u201cYou can tell he\u2019s not playing without being told. Need him today.\u201dThey could also use that World Cup version of Richarlison.\u201d     3.42pm    84 mins: Villa get a corner on the right but it is header clear at the front post.   K\u00e1ri Tulinius says: \u201cI think that, mainly, Spurs haven\u2019t won anything big lately because of randomness. They could well have won any number of trophies in the last decade, but the proverbial ball didn\u2019t bounce for them. That said, once a team has had a run of bad luck, that does start to affect players psychologically.\u201d     3.40pm    82 mins: A triple change for Villa: Chambers, Ings and Bednarek and on. Buendia, Douglas Luiz and Konsa off.      3.38pm    80 mins: Douglas Luiz whacks another shot at Lloris but he holds on this time. The Brazilian is left in a heap after twisting his knee after taking the shot. It looks like he will be coming off. Pape Sarr is on for his Tottenham debut, alongside Emerson Royal. Bissouma and Doherty depart.   Updated at 3.49pm GMT    3.36pm    78 mins: Alexandra Ashton emails: \u201cIn response to Dominic (68\u2019 ), I have absolutely no idea why we\u2019ve declined so rapidly from the highs of last season. Granted, a lot of sides in the league have massively improved over the summer, but for the past three months or so we\u2019ve looked like last season\u2019s Burnley.\"In fact, I might even favour Kompany\u2019s Burnley, top of the Championship, against us at the moment. And we concede a goal as I was writing this, so that\u2019s a fantastic omen of the year to come.\u201d  Joe Pearson loves McGinn\u2019s pass: \u201cIndeed a great goal, but that assist! Chef\u2019s kiss!\u201d Coutinho is coming on to replace the stricken McGinn.     3.34pm    76 mins: Villa have been the better team since the opener and Spurs really cannot offer much in response.  McGinn seems to pull up with a hamstring issue.  At this point, Spurs might as well bring Dier on up top.      3.32pm    74 mins: Villa win the ball back from Kane in the Spurs half. A pass finds McGinn who lifts the ball into the box for Douglas Luiz, he takes a touch and then calmly dinks his shot beyond Lloris.   Updated at 3.45pm GMT    3.31pm   GOAL! Tottenham 0-2 Aston Villa (Douglas Luiz, 74)  A neat finish from the Brazilian.   Updated at 3.36pm GMT    3.30pm    72 mins: Hojbjerg and Bissouma are just so passive in central midfield. Neither providing the passing ability that Spurs currently need in there. Bissouma aims a long pass to the corner and it just breezes out for a throw-in.      3.28pm    70 mins: David Dein emails his opinion in response to Bogdan Kotarlic (58 mins): \u201cCan be answered in a single sentence. Daniel Levy has run the club really badly, with appalling choices at critical moments.\u201d We will assume, for now, it is not that David Dein.   Updated at 3.35pm GMT    3.26pm    68 mins: Some nice one-touch from Spurs ends with Son nudging the ball to Kane inside the box but it bounces to an awkward height and he can only slash the ball wide. Dominic Salmon emails: \u201cAt the beginning of the season, Spurs couldn\u2019t lay a glove on any of the top teams, only managing a supremely jammy point out of the Chelsea game, now we\u2019re making heavy weather and playing like turgid lumps of unwanted pudding batter against EVERY team in the league. Onwards and backwards!\u201d   Updated at 3.29pm GMT    3.24pm    66 mins: Cash is coming on for Bailey. Villa are looking to be more defensive already, it would seem. Looks like Cash will operate ahead of Young.  Villa are wasting time and Konsa is booked for taking an age to take a free-kick. He seems upset but he has set his own downfall.      3.22pm    64 mins: Watkins receives a pass from Buendia inside the box but he takes too long to shoot and Doherty gets in the way.      3.20pm    62 mins: Spurs break from a Villa corner. It looks like Kane has played Son through down the left but Young reads the danger and slides in to intercept.  Perisic swings in a corner from the right \u2026 and straight out for a goal kick. Sessegnon replaces Gil.      3.18pm    60 mins: Bissouma is the latest Spurs man in the book. His crime is clipping the ankles of Kamara 3o yards out. Douglas Luiz takes the free-kick but it flicks off the wall and out for a corner.  \u201cThis is like city yesterday,\u201d says Jeff Sachs. \u201cThey win the possession competition but don\u2019t score the winning goals\u201d     3.16pm    58 mins: Bogdan Kotarlic asks: \u201cWhat (or who) is the main reason that the Spurs haven\u2019t won a trophy in the last few years? I mean, they have got some excellent players, good managers, a lot of passionate supporters but every season it is the same old story, no trophies, wasted years, wasted talent, wasted money...\u201d I think it would take a book to explain.     3.15pm    57 mins: The ball bounces to Perisic in the box, he takes a touch and then hits his shot over while leaning back.   Updated at 3.27pm GMT    3.14pm    57 mins: Kane is taken out by Mings when trying to thread a through ball, because that\u2019s what he does. The centre-back gets a booking for his troubles.      3.13pm    56 mins: If you are into gamesmanship, then the remaining 35 minutes here could be right up your street. Villa look keen to waste as much time as possible.   Updated at 3.23pm GMT    3.12pm    54 mins: Villa have looked comfortable in defence thus far and Spurs do not have much in the way of changes to make, so they will be ecstatic by the situation.     3.10pm    52 mins: This means that Spurs have conceded first in their past seven matches in the Premier League. What a ludicrous record.  Jeff Sachs emails: \u201cPathetic Spurs.\u201d     3.08pm    50 mins: Douglas Luiz takes aim from 30 yards, his shot bounces in front of Lloris who cannot hold it, allowing Watkins to reach the rebound first, take a touch and pass to Buendia to slot home from 12 yards.      3.08pm   GOAL! Spurs 0-1 Aston Villa (Buendia, 50)  That\u2019s a turn up for the books!   Updated at 3.14pm GMT    3.07pm    49 mins: It is all Spurs in the opening few minutes. Villa are just inviting the pressure on and Spurs are happy to endeavour to find an opening \u2013 currently without success.  \u201cI\u2019m not sure there are no game changers on the Spurs bench,\u201d says Joe Pearson. \u201cTanganga always seems inches away from getting sent off. That would change the game!\u201d      3.05pm    47 mins: Roger Kirkby has a plan: \u201cHappy New Year Will, it\u2019s games like these where you wish there was a rule to make 2 players from each team having to be in the opponent\u2019s half at all times. They can\u2019t be offside and must be at least 10 yards from the halfway line. It\u2019s just drab, drab football.\u201d     3.03pm   Second half  Here we go again!      2.59pm    A reminder of the Spurs bench \u2026 Subs: Forster, Dier, Tanganga, Sanchez, Sessegnon, Emerson Royal, Spence, Sarr, Skipp Apart from Sessegnon, you would not back any of them to really change the game.      2.54pm    There will be plenty of focus in the half-time analysis of the one shot on target. I cannot wait.      2.52pm    \u201cGood morning and Happy New Year from Pittsburgh!\u201d Happy New Year Eric Peterson. \u201cImpressed to see Spurs play those last five minutes of the first half like they\u2019d already fallen behind. That\u2019s progress.\u201d A great resolution from Spurs.      2.48pm    \u201cC\u2019mon Will,\u201d says Mary Waltz, \u201cdon\u2019t you get it? Both teams realize many of their fans a suffering from post New Year\u2019s hangovers and don\u2019t want to upset them with too much action.\u201d I think those people need something to focus on.     2.47pm   Half time: Tottenham 0-0 Aston Villa  Aston Villa have made themselves very hard to break down and therefore this half has been rather tedious.   Updated at 2.51pm GMT    2.45pm    45 mins: Two minutes added on.     2.44pm    44 mins: Son looks to find Kane in space inside the box but he puts too much on his pass, allowing Olsen to come out and claim.  Moments later Son whips in a cross from the left, which hits Young on the elbow just outside the box. A free-kick is given. Son lines up the set-piece to the left of the area. He shoots but it is straight at Olsen.      2.42pm    42 mins: Finally, a bit of excitement. But it is followed up with a couple of minutes of Spurs knocking the ball around.      2.41pm    40 mins: Off the line! Spurs\u2019 patient buildup pays off. A ball is played over for Perisic to latch onto; he forces Olsen out of his net and crosses to Kane at the back post to nod at the goalkeeper-less goal, only for Young to dive to his right to head clear.   Updated at 2.45pm GMT    2.38pm    38 mins: Davies is the third Spurs centre-back to be booked. He jumps into a tackle on Young, leaving the Villa man on the turf. Considering Villa have barely attacked, it is impressive that Davies, Lenglet and Romero have all been cautioned. It should be said, all of them were pretty needless.   Updated at 2.44pm GMT    2.36pm    36 mins: Watching this match requires plenty of patience. It is frankly underwhelming. We are still awaiting a shot on target. There have only been three off target to be fair.      2.34pm    34 mins: Villa do not seem to know how to attack when they do get the all in the Spurs half. It is all a bit slow. They seem quite happy to let Spurs have possession and pass the ball side to side.  Joe Pearson emails: \u201cGoogle wants me to make Ciorba de Perisoare when I search for \u2018Romanian sour soup\u2019. But it has meatballs, so probably not the same.\u201d  I am sure there are many various styles.      2.32pm    32 mins: Olsen catches a cross and immediately throws it out for Watkins to chase but his progress is immediately halted by Lenglet pulling him down. The Frenchman is booked for his troubles.      2.30pm    30 mins: Son swings in a corner from the left but it is dreadful and Young volleys clear from the front post.  \u201cIf Villa are playing with six at the back is that parking the mini-bus?\u201d asks David Paradine. I see it as more of a transit van.      2.29pm    28 mins: Mings gives the ball away with a long pass down the pitch but makes amends by whacking into the back of Son to head clear. Romero is back (and in the book). The World Cup winner jumps in with two feet off the ground and goes straight through Watkins. An impressively crap challenge.   Updated at 2.37pm GMT    2.26pm    26 mins: I am not sure Bryan Gil has touched the ball yet. Watkins and Bissouma go for the same ball on the edge of the Villa box. Watkins catches his opponent with a boot on the arm but Bissouma still goes down clutching his head. He eventually gets up.      2.25pm    24 mins: Young is down on the deck after clattering into Davies. Villa do have Cash on the bench, at least.  It is bors. \u2018The ingredient bor\u0219 consists of water in which wheat or barley bran, sometimes sugar beet or a slice of bread have fermented.\u2019      2.22pm    22 mins: Aston Villa are playing very deep whenever Spurs get the ball. Emery is very keen on organisation and being tough to break down. I think they currently have six at the back. It is working because Spurs can only pass the ball sideways or backwards.  Good to have options.       2.20pm    20 mins: Son runs back and makes a tackle after losing the ball. He is so frustrated with himself that he removes his Zorro mask to offer protection after suffering a fractured eye socket and throws it off the pitch.   Updated at 2.35pm GMT    2.18pm    18 mins: Neither goalkeeper has been called upon to make a save thus far and the crowd seems a bit flat. It is classic New Year\u2019s Day fare.      2.16pm    16 mins: Doherty chests down a crossfield pass but runs straight into Digne, causing the Spurs man to go down. He shouts at the ref to demand a free-kick on the edge of the box and he should get one but the man in black waves play on.      2.14pm    14 mins: Doherty drives into the box and looks like he is about to shoot from close range but Kamara reads the dangers and gets across just in time to turn the right-back\u2019s effort behind.  \u201cHappy New Year Will!\u201d Happy New Year, Yash Gupta. \u201cEven before World Cup it became clear Arsenal will finish ahead and to be honest, it hurts but it is what it is. Spurs last won league back in 1961. I\u2019ve only seen us win 1 trophy. It has always been about moments in this comedy club which I absolutely adore. So yeah looking forward to Gil balling it and hopefully he scores 2 goals instead of being coming off after 30 minutes. Come on!\u201d     2.13pm    12 mins: \u201cOK Will, I will bite,\u201d says Mary Waltz. \u201cWhat exactly is Romanian soup? General ingredients? Brothy or Stew like? Oh, HNY to the entire MBM universe.\u201d Basically \u2026 you boil a chicken in a pan with some veg, bay leaf etc. At the end you add some souring agent (it\u2019s some niche stuff purchased from the local Romanian store). For a more detailed answer, I will ask my mother-in-law at half-time.     2.10pm    10 mins: Watkins times his run well and collects the ball in space on the left before cutting in onto his right foot, only to drag his shot wide. \u201cI\u2019ve held the opinion that Mings is a borderline dirty player. But I guess that is part of the center back profile?\u201d asks Joe Pearson. He has committed a few bad fouls in his time, that\u2019s for sure, but I do not think he is dirty overall.   Updated at 2.14pm GMT    2.09pm    8 mins: Buendia passes the ball out of play rather than to teammate Digne.  It is all pretty even on the pitch, with far more fouls than attacking happening.      2.07pm    6 mins: Son tries to instigate a break but Bailey decides to take him down crudely, mainly out of frustration for not being awarded a free-kick moments earlier.  Spurs knock the ball over the top for Perisic to chase but a free-kick is awarded against him for a little nudge on Young. A weak decision from the ref.      2.05pm    4 mins: Mings takes a few touches too many, then flies into a challenge with Bissouma. Mings is one of those Premier League players I have never been convinced by. Prove me wrong, Tyrone.  Gary Stover emails: \u201cRomanian soup sounds good, but Romanian pizza is the big deal now.\u201d Soup does not give away your location. I hope.     2.02pm    2 mins: Villa enjoy the majority of possession in the early stages. Bissouma takes down Douglas Luiz around 35 yards from goal to give away a free-kick. Spurs do like a slow start after all \u2026     2.00pm   Kick off  Peep! Peep! Peep! Here we go!     2.00pm    We will start with a minute\u2019s applause for Pele and former Spurs player Maurice Norman.     1.56pm    The players are in the tunnel. I would argue Villa have the better pre-match jacket but I am open to persuasion.      1.50pm    Just tucking into some Romanian sour soup pre-match. I live a weird life.      1.48pm    Unai Emery on Martinez being on the bench: \u201cIt was our plann. He needed time to rest. He has trained two times. We have Robin Olsen and we trust our players.\u201d On the match: \u201cWe did good play against Liverpool but were disappointed with the result. We need to keep the same mentality and we will win.\u201d     1.45pm    Leon Bailey: \u201cWe are still building, we are lot more understanding of the manager. It is a process for us, we are going to take things step-by-step. It is a big game, we are going to stick to our game plan. \u201cThe game plan today is to create a lot of opportunities. Hopefully we can take one of them.\u201d These on-pitch interviews a mind-boggling, mainly due to the laboured questioning and over-excited camera work. I am not sure it is worth it.      1.36pm    Conte: \u201cIt is very important to have Hugo and Romero in the starting XI. They are in good physical condition and recovered mentally. \u201cIn the last games we have conceded the first goal and we have had to come back. We need to pay more attention.\u201d Son: \u201cIt is very important we finish in a top four position and we have that in our hands. We need to start well.\u201d     1.29pm    Dejan Kulusevski is missing with a muscle problem picked up in training. He is set to undergo a scan tomorrow and Conte hopes he will only miss a single match.      1.28pm    \u201cHow is Cristian Romero in the squad today?\u201d asks Alec Butcher. \u201cSurely he\u2019s still nursing the world\u2019s biggest hangover? Also Gil gets a rare start but expect him to be hooked at 39 mins when Spurs go 0-2 down as is our custom recently. Nice to Pape Sarr and Djed make bench.\u201d Romero is just a committed professional.   Updated at 2.04pm GMT    1.24pm    Unai Emery is back in north London. He had a somewhat underwhelming spell as Arsene Wenger\u2019s successor. He has won half of his four games in charge of Villa and will see how close his team are to being able to challenge the top six.      1.19pm    Naturally, there is another Premier League match after this one. Here is my look at Forest and the year ahead.       1.17pm    Bryan Gil gets his first Premier League start for Spurs since joining the club in 2021. He is only 21 still, so has time to develop and flourish under Antonio Conte. Today would be a good time to show what he can offer.      1.10pm    How has your Premier League done in the first half of the season? We asked the fans.       1.04pm    Emi Martinez is left on the bench for Villa but Cristian Romero starts for Spurs. Go figure.   Updated at 1.15pm GMT    1.03pm   Starting lineups  Tottenham (3-4-3): Lloris; Romero, Lenglet, Davies; Doherty, Hojbjerg, Bissouma, Perisic; Gil, Kane, Son Subs: Forster, Dier, Tanganga, Sanchez, Sessegnon, Emerson Royal, Spence, Sarr, Skipp Aston Villa (4-3-3): Olsen; Young, Konsa, Mings, Digne; McGinn, Douglas Luiz, Kamara; Buendia, Watkins, Bailey Subs: Martinez, Cash, Sanson, Ings, Chambers, Augustinsson, Bednarek, Coutinho, Archer  Updated at 1.03pm GMT    1.00pm   Hello  Happy New Year! I hope you have all set your resolutions for 2023. Harry Kane admits his is the same every year: to improve. It is a nice idea but at some point he will regress, so he should just cut back on the sugar or something.  We have, in theory, a re-run of the World Cup final with Hugo Lloris in one goal and Emi Martinez down the other end trying to control his urge to sexualise his goalkeeper gloves. Nor should we forget that Cristian Romero is available for Antonio Conte. It is a slightly different setting to Qatar and we might not get the thriller the final provided but I am optimistic of a decent match.  Villa were turned over by Liverpool in their Premier League return, so will be hoping to kickstart the second half of the season under Unai Emery today, but that is easier said than done.  Spurs have won 12 of the past 14 meetings between the two sides, a sign of their dominance in this fixture. They are struggling for consistency under Conte, perfectly summarised by their comeback draw at Brentford on Boxing Day.  Both sides will be looking to start the year with a bang. Let\u2019s hope it\u2019s a cracker! Kick-off: 2pm GMT  "

Bye!     5.38pm    And finally, here\u2019s a report on Brighton\u2019s victory over Southampton:  Adam Lallana struck against his former club as Brighton inflicted more misery on struggling Southampton with a resounding 3-1 Premier League victory at St Mary\u2019s. The Saints academy graduate Lallana benefited from a major blunder from the home goalkeeper Gavin Bazunu to put Albion ahead before Romain Perraud\u2019s calamitous own goal doubled their half-time advantage. Brighton winger Solly March thumped home a third to cap a dismal first home game in top-flight management for the Southampton manager Nathan Jones.  Much more here:      5.32pm    Andy Hunter watched Wolves snatching all three points at an increasingly angry Goodison Park:  Discontent was building among the home crowd inside Goodison Park even before the Wolves substitute Rayan A\u00eft-Nouri gave Julen Lopetegui the perfect start to his reign and heightened the pressure on Frank Lampard with a 95th-minute winner against Everton. The French defender pounced in the final minute as Wolves secured a fortunate but dramatic victory that lifted them off the bottom of the Premier League. Everton\u2019s overly cautious approach was generating dismay among their fans when James Tarkowski launched one final, long ball towards the Wolves penalty area. It returned with punishing interest, and after A\u00eft-Nouri scrambled home a cross from fellow substitute Adama Traor\u00e9 Everton were left to reflect on another ineffective, wasteful display. It is now six defeats in eight league games for Lampard\u2019s faltering side. Improvement in the final third cannot come quickly enough for Everton.  Much more here:      5.16pm    Peter Lansley witnessed Newcastle\u2019s emphatic win at a limp Leicester:  Not even the World Cup has proved a deterrent in Newcastle United\u2019s pursuit of Champions League football as Eddie Howe\u2019s team climbed into second place in the Premier League with a victory secured in just over half an hour. Early goals from Chris Wood, from the penalty spot, Miguel Almir\u00f3n and Joelinton brought Newcastle a 10th win in 11 games in all competitions against one of the division\u2019s supposed in-form teams, for whom the six-week international break in Qatar proved a block rather than a spur. On this evidence, Newcastle should relish hosting these opponents again in a fortnight in the Carabao Cup quarter-final.  Much more here:      5.15pm    Ed Aarons was at Selhurst Park to see Fulham romp to three goals and just as many points:  Patrick Vieira must be wondering how his side got this so wrong. Crystal Palace\u2019s hopes of recording a fourth successive home victory in the Premier League for the first time in their history were destroyed in a three-minute spell in the first half by a clinical Fulham team led by the brilliant Aleksandar Mitrovic. The disastrous defending that allowed Bobby DeCordova-Reid to open the scoring on 31 minutes was compounded by Tyrick Mitchell\u2019s rush of blood to the head that earned him a straight red card and left Vieira\u2019s side with a mountain to climb. Another red card for James Tomkins \u2013 making his first Premier League start since Boxing Day last year in absence of the suspended Marc Guehi \u2013 and further goals from Fulham\u2019s captain Tim Ream and Mitrovic, with his tenth of the campaign, swept Marco Silva\u2019s side to a deserved victory that leaves them level on points with Liverpool.

So for now, there\u2019s this: Premier League Crystal Palace 0-3 FulhamEverton 1-2 Wolverhampton WanderersLeicester City 0-3 Newcastle UnitedSouthampton 1-2 Brighton &amp; Hove Albion     4.55pm    Well that\u2019s going to sting.      4.54pm   GOAL! Everton 1-2 Wolves (Ait Nouri, 90+5 mins)  Wolves have nicked it on the break in the last minute! Traore is released on the right and his cross deflects to Ait-Nouri, who smacks it in!   Updated at 5.05pm GMT    4.51pm    Newcastle somehow fail to score a fourth! Murphy rounds the keeper and has a chance to roll the ball into a net guarded only by Wout Faes, but he hits Faes with his shot and it goes wide!     4.50pm    Into stoppage time at Goodison Park, where Everton have been pushing for a late winner. They\u2019ve got another five minutes to find one.     4.47pm    Another excellent save, this time from Pope to stop Vardy pulling a goal back for Leicester against Newcastle.     4.44pm    A brilliant point-blank save from Sa, coming out to claim a cross, realising he\u2019s not going to get there and doing the next best thing, stops Everton going ahead.     4.43pm    On Prime, Martin Keown describes that Willian touch as \u201ca lovely little cross\u201d, which I think is a very generous analysis of what looked like a miskick, but hey, it\u2019s Christmas.     4.42pm    Personally I\u2019m entirely in favour of post-tackle celebrations. This isn\u2019t exactly a tackle, though, more of a sliding deflection into touch. Still, if you enjoy it, why not let the world know?      4.40pm   GOAL! Crystal Palace 0-3 Fulham (Mitrovic, 80 mins)  A third for Fulham! A cross from the right loops beyond the far post to Willian, who scuffs his volley into the ground and it bounces up nicely for Mitrovic to head in from four yards.   Updated at 5.06pm GMT    4.34pm    There was a long delay after that second Fulham goal while the VAR pondered whether the ball had hit Mitrovic\u2019s hand on its way to Ream. It looked like it did, but the goal stands anyway.     4.33pm   GOAL! Southampton 1-3 Brighton (Ward-Prowse, 73 mins)  James Ward-Prowse brings Southampton back into the game, heading in the rebound after his own penalty is well saved by Sanchez.     4.31pm   GOAL! Crystal Palace 0-2 Fulham (Ream, 71 mins)  Of course there\u2019ll be lots of Palace fans who can\u2019t get no sleep after this. Fulham swing in a corner, Mitrovic knocks down and Ream slams it into the roof of the net!  Updated at 4.32pm GMT    4.25pm    A minute\u2019s applause at Crystal Palace for the Palace fan Maxi Jazz, the Faithless frontman who died this week.      4.23pm    Sheffield United are now 2-0 up against Coventry, Ciaran Clark with the second. At Selhurst Park, Fulham are threatening to run riot against a now woefully undermanned Crystal Palace.      4.20pm   Red card! Crystal Palace go down to nine!  James Tomkins brings down Mitrovic and earns himself a second booking. A weird challenge \u2013 the ball is played back towards the keeper and rather than running back to shepherd it towards its target he stands still and sticks out an arm to block Mitrovic, who runs into it, goes down and rolls around a bit. The Mitrovic dramatics weren\u2019t really necessary, but it was a deliberate movement and Tomkins can\u2019t really quibble.     4.15pm   GOAL! Southampton 0-3 Brighton (March, 56 mins)  A fabulous left-foot rocket from March, 25 yards from goal, sends the ball flying into the top corner!   Updated at 4.47pm GMT    4.14pm    Sheffield United, second in the Championship with six wins in their last seven, concede a penalty against Coventry. Wes Foderingham saves, and they remain 1-0 up.     4.08pm    Leicester have brought Jamie Vardy on for Daka at half-time. Southampton have made two changes, bringing Stuart Armstrong and Joe Aribo on, and taking off Diallo and Djenepo.     4.04pm    Second halves are under way. Strap yourselves back in for another 45 minutes of fun.     3.53pm   Half time scores  Here are all the Football League scores as they stand. Teams winning away from home in the Premier League: three (out of four). Teams winning away from home in the Championship, League One and League Two combined: five (out of 28).

There have been eight first-half goals in its four 3pm kick-offs, and no other team in the Football League has more than one except struggling Burton Albion in League One, who look to be on their way to a first league win since 22 October being as they are 3-0 up against Lincoln City.     3.40pm   GOAL! Southampton 0-2 Brighton (Perraud own goal, 35 mins)  Pervis Estupinan\u2019s low cross from the left gets past the keeper at the near post and Romain Perraud has to do something to stop March just tapping it in. And, in his wisdom, he chooses to tap it in himself.      3.37pm   GOAL! Crystal Palace 0-1 Fulham! And then a red card! It's all gone wrong for Palace!  Bobby Reid puts Fulham ahead with a nice first-time finish, and a few seconds later Tyrick Mitchell mistimes a challenge and is given his marching orders!   Updated at 3.55pm GMT    3.35pm   GOALS! Leicester 0-3 Newcastle (Joelinton, 33 mins)  Martin Logan emails to point out that another goal description has gone missing and Newcastle are in fact two up, Almiron having scored a very fine seventh-minute second. And as I\u2019m redescribing that Joelinton heads in a corner and, just as Podence did when he scored for Wolves, stuffs the ball up his shirt in celebration!   Updated at 3.53pm GMT    3.29pm    At Selhurst Park, Jordan Ayew\u2019s first-time effort from 15 yards or so absolutely thunders into the crossbar.      3.25pm    A chance for Leicester, after Dewsbury-Hall plays in Daka. Pope flies out and Daka hits the ball into him, it ricochets back into Daka, and then rolls gently goalwards allowing a defender to clear.     3.24pm   GOAL! Everton 1-1 Wolves (Podence, 22 mins)  That is a lovely equaliser. It starts with a Wolves corner, taken short. The ball in lands at the feet of Moutinho, just outside the area, and he lifts a beautiful right-foot pass over the defence and Podence runs through and tucks in!   Updated at 3.39pm GMT    3.22pm   GOAL! Everton 1-0 Wolves (Mina, 7 mins)  A bit of a technical hiccup here saw a couple of entries disappear somewhere between my computer and the rest of the world. Anyway, Yerry Mina scored a while ago, heading in from a corner after his marker fell over.      3.17pm   GOAL! Southampton 0-1 Brighton (Lallana, 14 mins)  A lovely move from Brighton ends with a cross from the right-hand corner of the area, and a nicely-judged glancing header from Adam Lallana. In truth it was too close to the keeper, who should have pushed it to safety but opted instead to flap it in haplessly.   Updated at 3.52pm GMT    3.11pm    If Hugo Bueno is going to mark Yerry Mina at every set piece, this could get very messy for Wolves.     3.04pm   GOAL! Leicester 0-1 Newcastle (Wood, 3 mins)  And that\u2019s how to take a penalty. The goalkeeper dives to his left and the ball goes hard and high the other way.   Updated at 3.22pm GMT    3.03pm    Penalty to Newcastle! Less than two minutes on the clock and Amartey has brought down Joelinton. You could watch football forever and never see a clearer penalty.     3.00pm    Peeeeeep! They\u2019re off!     3.00pm    There will be a minute\u2019s applause before all the Premier League games for George Cohen, who died this week.      2.56pm    The players are coming out, and the clock is about to strike football o\u2019clock!     2.50pm    Here\u2019s Jeremy Alexander\u2019s match report on that game. Absolutely brutal final sentence.      2.49pm    \u201cI remember Oldham 11 Southport 0 on Boxing Day 1962,\u201d writes Mike Fitzgerald. \u201cThe local Southport Visitor newspaper headlined their match report, \u201cSOUTHPORT CAN\u2019T \u2019OLDAM.\u201d The Boxing Day game that stands out in my memory was travelling to watch my team (Watford) at Fulham in 2000. We lost 5-0 and afterwards I remember talking to Jeremy Alexander, who was reporting on the game for the Guardian, had to file the teams in formation and wasn\u2019t sure given the chaos what Watford\u2019s shape had been. Between us we eventually settled on three at the back and a fluid (or more accurately completely disorganised) midfield seven.      2.40pm    \u201cRe your photo of Goodison\u2019s Main Stand, about 20 years ago I took my father on a stadium tour,\u201d writes Gary Naylor. \u201cOur guide walked in to say hello, a strongly built guy of average height, and my father\u2019s face transformed - Dave Hickson. Both long gone now, but a moment to remember.\u201d Lovely memory of a magnificent old stadium. Sadly now the photograph has long gone too.     2.09pm    Team news is in, and the Premier League protagonists are these: Crystal Palace v FulhamCrystal Palace: Guaita; Clyne, Tomkins, Andersen, Mitchell; Schlupp, Doucoure, Eze; Olise, Ayew, Zaha.

Well let\u2019s just crack on with what promises to be an afternoon of manic festive fun, shall we? Yuletide games are no longer the guarantee of ludicrous scorelines that they once were but it\u2019s still notable that two of the six highest-scoring games in Premier League history were played between Christmas and New Year (Tottenham 6-4 Reading in 2007 and Arsenal 7-3 Newcastle in 2012, since you ask), and today is the first anniversary of the comparatively dull Manchester City 6-3 Leicester.  So here are today\u2019s 3pm kick-offs in the English Football League. There\u2019s a good chance that a few of this lot will turn out to be completely bonkers. Fingers crossed, eh?

                    "body": "The chair of the disability royal commission has written to Australian airline and airport chiefs about improving their treatment of travellers with disabilities, after the inquiry heard stories of people dropped on the floor and discrimination against assistance dogs. The royal commission has so far heard that people with disabilities are routinely subject to violence, abuse, neglect and exploitation when flying domestically, with participants telling the inquiry they felt airlines were \u201cdehumanising\u201d them and that complaints were rarely followed up. Advocates have told Guardian Australia that complaining through the Australian Human Rights Commission is often the only way to seek recourse. In a letter sent to the various chief executives this week, Ronald Sackville KC outlined concerns that people with disabilities have reported to the royal commission, with travellers frequently facing \u201cinaccessible facilities and services\u201d and \u201cunhelpful practices and systems adopted by airlines\u201d.  Sackville listed shortcomings raised by people with disabilities that airlines and airports could address to make flying \u201ca more inclusive experience\u201d. \u201cPeople with disability often experience avoidable challenges when travelling by air,\u201d Sackville wrote. \u201cMore can be done by airlines and domestic airports to address those challenges.\u201d Sackville wrote about how people with disabilities had told the commission that their wheelchairs had been damaged during travel and that airlines had not taken responsibility to rectify the issue.  Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup  He also outlined stories of travellers with disability who were dropped on the floor because the hoist that accommodates wheelchairs was not being used correctly by air staff. Limited access to safe ramps and discrimination against people who rely on assistance dogs was also flagged by the commissioner. Sackville\u2019s letter follows workshops with 60 Australians with a disability last year about their experiences, which also found that discrimination and poor service were more prominent amid flight cancellations \u2013 which were at record levels in the middle of last year. People with disabilities said they were seen as an \u201cafterthought\u201d when passengers on cancelled flights were managed. \u201cWhen issues are brought to them, they are easily dismissed and not taken seriously,\u201d one participant said. The royal commission\u2019s insights follow the Guardian\u2019s reporting of travellers with a disability being rejected assistance and left stranded at airports \u2013 with their complaints falling on deaf ears. In August, Tony Jones, who relies on a wheelchair due to a spinal cord injury, lodged a complaint with the Australian Human Rights Commission after he was turned away at the gate when trying to board a Jetstar flight in Sydney. Lawyers representing Jones have said there are low levels of industry compliance with disability standards, and that the onus is not on airlines and airports to comply but rather on individuals to make discrimination complaints \u2013 with the AHRC the only avenue. In June, a French national with severe spinal cord damage after being shot during a terrorist attack in Paris said he was left in an airbridge at Sydney airport with his young family for more than an hour. In December, a man requiring a wheelchair said he was removed from his Qatar Airways flight after boarding the plane and left stranded at Melbourne airport because of his disability. A statement on behalf of Qantas and Jetstar said the airline group was \u201cconsidering the matters raised\u201d. \u201cQantas and Jetstar are working hard to improve the experience for customers with accessibility needs.\u201d A Virgin Australia spokesperson said it would be giving the royal commission\u2019s letter \u201cvery close consideration\u201d. \u201cWe know how important it is to ensure we make airline travel inclusive and accessible for all our guests.\u201d Guardian Australia also contacted Rex for comment. Speaking generally about the issues air travellers with disability face, James Goodwin, the chief executive of the Australian Airports Association, said the industry had launched initiatives with members about hidden disabilities. Goodwin also said issues had been more pronounced in the past year given the pandemic exodus of aviation staff and a largely new, less experienced workforce filling their shoes. \u201cAirports continue to work with other parts of the industry \u2013 including government agencies that operate at airports \u2013 and stakeholders to share information so we can continue to promote inclusive and consistent practices,\u201d Goodwin said."

                    "body": "Good morning. Yesterday afternoon, Suella Braverman visited the Manston asylum processing centre. The home secretary arrived from Dover, about 20 miles away, by Chinook helicopter. She didn\u2019t speak to the media, instead issuing a statement saying she was \u201cincredibly proud of the skill and dedication shown to tackle this challenging situation\u201d. But the challenges show no sign of going away. As more than 1,000 people have been removed from the overcrowded centre in the last few days, it has become clear that frantic attempts to clear out the site may be throwing up as many problems as they solve \u2013 and the crisis is not limited to Manston itself. Home Office officials are said to be \u201csitting refreshing booking.com\u201d for hotels, but those clicks were not quick enough for the 11 asylum seekers dumped in central London without accommodation on Tuesday; there are now reports that a dozen more spent the night at Victoria station on Wednesday (\u00a3) after being dropped off with nowhere to go. Yesterday, the Guardian reported another appalling story on the safeguarding of asylum seekers: the alleged rape of a teenage boy at a refugee hotel in east London. For today\u2019s newsletter, I spoke to Amelia Gentleman, who broke the story of the first group stranded in London, about what happened next \u2013 and what those now being moved on from Manston can expect. Here are the headlines. Five big stories  Manchester Arena attack | An inquiry into the Manchester arena terrorist attack has concluded that John Atkinson, one of the 22 people who were killed, would probably have survived had there not been \u201cinadequacies\u201d in the emergency response. Economy | The Bank of England has warned the UK risks being plunged into the longest recession in 100 years after it pushed up the cost of borrowing to 3%, the biggest single interest rate rise since 1989. Scroll down for a reading list on the rate rise. Twitter | Elon Musk will begin mass layoffs at Twitter on Friday, sharply reducing the social media platform\u2019s workforce, the company said in an email to staff on Thursday. Reports have suggested that as many as half of the company\u2019s 7,000 workers could lose their jobs. Pakistan | Former prime minister Imran Khan has been wounded in the leg after a gunman open fired at a container lorry that was carrying him. Khan was leading a protest march on Islamabad to demand a snap election. Protest | A group of pupils and parents in east London temporarily blocked the local council from removing their \u201cschool street\u201d \u2013 a road with traffic restrictions outside schools during drop-off and pick-up times. Children climbed on top of road barriers, shouting and singing as construction workers tried and failed to move them.  In depth: \u2018Nobody is really acknowledging how big the problems are\u2019  When I spoke to Amelia Gentleman yesterday, she had just finished a call with one of the Manston detainees who was left in central London without accommodation, warm clothing, or any indication about what they should do next. \u201cI think I have a clearer sense of what happened now,\u201d she said. \u201cBut some of the logic is very hard to understand.\u201d Here\u2019s what what we know about how that situation came about, and what awaits asylum seekers after they leave places like Manston. *** Initial release from detention After Amelia\u2019s initial story was published, the Home Office said that the \u201casylum seekers are only released from Manston when we have assurances that they have accommodation to go to\u201d. This is what that looked like, according to a young man from Afghanistan she spoke with: \u201cHe had been in Manston for a week and a half, in a tent with 170 people all sleeping on the floor. The roof was leaking, the shower wasn\u2019t working, the loo wasn\u2019t working. \u201cOn Saturday morning, he has an interview with an Afghan interpreter with him, asking if he has friends and family in the UK. He says, yes, he has a friend in the UK he can stay with.\u201d After that interview, Amelia said, \u201che\u2019s put on a bus to London \u2013 but while he has somewhere to stay, there\u2019s no interpreter on the bus to help check that. People are getting on at the front asking if they are being taken to a hotel, and somebody who doesn\u2019t understand them is telling them yes.\u201d Another interviewee, also from Afghanistan, told Amelia that the bus driver told them: \u201cGo anywhere you want to go, it\u2019s not my responsibility.\u201d The asylum seeker went on: \u201cI told the driver I don\u2019t have any address or any relatives. He said: \u2018I can\u2019t do anything for you.\u2019\u201d Eventually, after charity volunteers contacted the Home Office, the stranded asylum seekers were taken to a hotel in Norwich. It all sounds like a disorganised disaster. \u201cPoor record-keeping at week 163 of the small boats response is system failure,\u201d a damning report on the processing of people arriving by small boat said earlier this year. It is now week 201. *** Accommodation problems The exorbitant costs of hotel accommodation for asylum seekers who have moved on from centres like Manston \u2013 currently estimated at \u00a36.8m per day, up from \u00a34.7m in January \u2013 has generated some anger, exacerbated by stories like this one reporting that one in four of those hotels are four or five star. (The story also says asylum seekers will be denied access to facilities like pools, spas and gyms.) What that account misses is how dire living conditions are for many of those housed by the Home Office \u2013 a reality underlined yesterday by this story from Emine Sinmaz and Jessica Elgot about an alleged rape of a teenage boy and sexual assault of a child under 13 at an east London refugee hotel. While the use of hotels is increasing because of the sheer number of people waiting for asylum claims to be processed, \u201cthe majority are in hostels or Home Office-run accommodation,\u201d Amelia said. \u201cWe\u2019ve run any number of stories over the years showing how poor the conditions are in some of these places.\u201d Meanwhile, Amelia added, the Home Office has a hard time finding the accommodation in the first place. \u201cA Home Office source told me that almost every place they identify triggers complaints from local MPs, and they move on.\u201d Councils make similar complaints, as this Matthew Weaver story explains. On Tuesday, LBC reported a government source claiming that Suella Braverman refused to approve hotel bookings for those at Manston because \u201cthey were in Tory voting areas\u201d. (The Home Office denies this.) All of that may explain why, whether or not a minority of asylum seekers are staying in hotels with a swimming pool they aren\u2019t allowed to use anyway, in many other cases basic checks appear not to be carried out on accommodation. Last year, Mohammed Munib Majeedi, a five-year-old Afghan boy, fell to his death through an open window on the ninth-floor of a \u00a333 per night hotel in Sheffield. There were reports that some windows on high floors had no latches and could be opened wide from the bottom. *** Poor standard of living The group taken to London by coach were left without money, train tickets, or warm clothing. \u201cThey weren\u2019t even told where they were in the city,\u201d Amelia said. \u201cThey were given mobile phones, but with no charge or no credit. The person I spoke to had to ask a passerby to explain where he was, and borrow his phone.\u201d Even outside these extreme circumstances, provision for asylum seekers is spartan. Those in hotels, who have food provided, receive \u00a38.24 per week to buy essentials. Those living in the community and buying their own food get \u00a340 a week. They are not allowed to work, but also have \u201cno recourse to public funds\u201d, meaning they are ineligible for benefits. Charities often have to provide clothes, especially in the cold winter months. Mobile phones which are confiscated when people first arrive are sometimes never returned (and have been illegally seized in the past). *** How is this crisis resolved? \u201cThat huge backlog of cases is disastrous for the smooth running of the Home Office, but it\u2019s also disastrous for the people caught up in it,\u201d Amelia said. \u201cThey\u2019re left with this profound sense of stagnation. They find it very hard to see how they\u2019re going to rebuild their lives.\u201d With no end in sight to the crisis, Aubrey Allegretti reports that Conservative MPs are becoming restive at a growing sense that the government has failed to grip the problem. The Home Office source Amelia spoke to was not optimistic about resolving any of this soon. \u201cThey were saying that there\u2019s this very fundamental issue,\u201d she said. \u201cMinisters feel the pressure from the public, and they talk like they just want the officials to fix it. But nobody is really acknowledging how big the problems are \u2013 and that until you change the system on a deep level, all of this is going to keep happening.\u201d What to read about the UK\u2019s interest rate rise  Rupert Jones explains how the 0.75% interest rate increase will affect loans, mortgages, credit cards and savings. Polly Toynbee argues that Britain needs to spend its way out of the downturn. \u201cIt\u2019s as if John Maynard Keynes had never proved the needless damage done by cutting during a recession, causing a long depression,\u201d she writes. Larry Elliott\u2019s analysis says that the Bank of England appears unlikely to push rates higher. \u201cAlready, some members of the MPC are getting nervous about squeezing a fragile economy too hard,\u201d he says. The Guardian\u2019s editorial from Wednesday views the rate rise as a mistake: \u201cDoctors no longer believe that bleeding the sick will make them healthy. Unfortunately, economic policymakers still do.\u201d The FT\u2019s Chris Giles explains (\u00a3) that while the Bank\u2019s headline forecast is for interest rates rising further and a two-year recession, it has given more prominence than usual to an alternative scenario where rates stay constant - and usefully explains the difference between the two.

She most recently fled Afghanistan in August 2021, as the Taliban were retaking the country. Afghani now lives in Canada with her husband and children. As a young woman, she went to university, where she gained an undergraduate degree and two master\u2019s degrees. Education had changed her life, she said, and so she set up a centre in Kabul to help schoolchildren.

                    "body": "Firing forehand winners past a legend and pumping his fists in a ferocious manner, Alex de Minaur gave the United Cup the local morale boost it needed on Monday night in Sydney. In front of an adoring audience at Ken Rosewall Arena, the Australian spearhead overcame a set deficit on his favourite court to defeat Rafael Nadal 3-6 6-1 7-5 for the first time. But his thrilling victory in the inaugural competition also served as a reminder of what Australian tennis has lost given the remodelling of the Davis and Billie Jean King Cups in recent years.  Those events once provided the best atmosphere in tennis. Partisan crowds almost always enhanced the occasion. Generations of players were inspired watching their heroes in national colours in ties from Melbourne to Mildura, from Perth to Cairns. But the centralisation of the competitions has eroded that passion. Without those ties, dreams could be dashed. As a case in point, Australian teams performed admirably to reach the finals of both the Davis Cup and Billie Jean King Cup in November. The men were beaten by Canada in Spain. The women fell to Switzerland in Glasgow. But both finals were played in the middle of the night, far removed from the eyes of young Australians, and drew nowhere near the attention they once would have around the nation. As finalists, Australia automatically qualify for the latter stages of both events in 2023, meaning the Davis and Billie Jean King Cup teams will be absent from home soil for at least another year. It gives the United Cup an opportunity to fill what has become a gaping void for Australians starved of regularly watching their best men and women in the traditional team competitions. The large crowds who have attended Australia\u2019s clashes against Great Britain and Spain at Ken Rosewall Arena over the past week demonstrate again just how strong that appetite is. The United Cup can only go so far, with Australia to alternate between Sydney, Perth and Brisbane on a triennial basis. But every three years fans in those cities can cheer on their local heroes. Young fans fortunate to watch de Minaur deliver on Monday must feel as inspired as the Australian was by those barracking for him. De Minaur said \u201cenjoying the atmosphere, the crowd, [where] you almost want to get the crowd involved after every single point and get fired up after every single point\u201d added to the thrill. A challenge for each of the Cups is to both lure fans and recreate this type of fervent passion for ties involving countries without the fortune of being able to play at home. De Minaur\u2019s triumph preceded a staunch defence of the inaugural event by Tennis Australia chief executive Craig Tiley on Tuesday in Melbourne. Tiley believes there is proof the event will be a success in Australia, stating that 40,000 fans attended ties played across the three host cities on Monday. In accepting this point, it must be noted that two-for-one ticket deals were on offer leading into the start of the tournament amid reports that sales were slow. \u201cThe United Cup is absolutely fantastic. If you watched last night, we\u2019ve had full stadiums. We\u2019ve had over 120,000 people already go through the gate,\u201d Tiley said. \u201cThat\u2019s remarkable. We\u2019ve never had that. It beats most major tennis events around the world for one day\u2019s attendance.\u201d But the withdrawal of Australia\u2019s top ranked players Nick Kyrgios and Ajla Tomljanovic was a significant blow and the reaction has proven far from united, despite Tiley\u2019s claim of \u201cunbelievably successful, great, positive feedback from the players.\u201d Nadal best signifies the conflict between those who see the United Cup\u2019s potential and what it currently is. The joy at watching his support for teammates is among the highlights to date. American great Chris Evert noted, watching Nadal scream his support for Badosa \u201cwarms my heart\u201d. Similar support has been evident on the team benches across the competition. Former world doubles No 1 Paul McNamee, co-founder of the Hopman Cup that ran in Australia until 2019, has long been an advocate for mixed teams events. He believes the mixed doubles rubber is the competition\u2019s best asset and believes it should be played earlier in the tie to add to its importance. Still, Nadal\u2019s criticism of a convoluted format on Monday night is among the reasons Tiley was forced to defend the United Cup on Tuesday. Earlier losses to Great Britain downgraded the Australia-Spain tie given the title hopes of both nations were shot (though it is worth noting ranking points and prize money were on the line in matches). Both Paula Badosa and Zoe Hives opted against playing a rubber scheduled for Tuesday night, citing shoulder and abdomen injuries respectively as precautionary measures ahead of the Australian Open. \u201c[The] competition is great. [The] idea is great. It\u2019s not great that today we are playing for nothing,\u201d Nadal said. Tiley himself acknowledged aspects of the United Cup require tinkering but said some problems stemmed from rushing to bring the event forward a year from an original date of 2024. \u201cWe\u2019ll do a debrief [on] what can be improved for 2024,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a great event. It\u2019s going to finish really strong in the finals in Sydney.\u201d"

And of course, playing with Rafa on the same team and having the guys \u2013 everybody here, all the legends \u2013 Rocket, Edberg, Stefan, thank you.\u201d\nHe\u2019s asked how special it was to finish playing alongside the other greats of his era: Djokovic, Murray and Nadal.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t want it to feel lonely out there,\u201d he says. \u201cIt felt lonely for a second when they told me to go out, or you wanted me to come out one more time. I feel great, but to be saying goodbye as a team \u2013 I always felt I was a team player at the heart \u2013 but singles doesn\u2019t really do that a whole lot. I\u2019ve had a team that traveled with me for around the world. It\u2019s been amazing with them. So thanks to everybody who made it work for so many years. And then of course, being on the team with Andy, Thomas, Novak, Mateo, Cam, Stefanos, Rafa and Casper and also the other team: you guys are unbelievable. It\u2019s been a pleasure, playing all these Laver Cups.\n\u201cIt does feel like a celebration to me. I wanted it to feel like this at the end and it\u2019s exactly what I hoped for. So thank you.\u201d\n\n\n\n 12.38am  \n\nA Federer tribute video is playing on the big screen. Federer, still overcome by emotion, looks up from the court. Once it finishes, he\u2019s called out for an on-court interview with Jim Courier.\n\u201cWe\u2019ll get through this somehow,\u201d he says, voice trembling. \u201cIt\u2019s been a wonderful day. I told the guys: I\u2019m happy, I\u2019m not sad.\u201d\n\n\n\n 12.29am  \n\nAfter shaking hands with Tiafoe and Sock at the net, a teary-eyed Federer returns to the Team Europe bench. He hugs each of his team-mates as David Guetta\u2019s Titanium blasts through the O2 Arena sound system before heading over to the Team World bench and doing the same. Every soul in the building in on their feat in a standing ovation, screaming their throats out. Federer takes a seat, the tears streaming down his face. Behind him, Nadal is crying as well. What a moment.\n\nUpdated at 12.36am BST\n\n\n 12.26am  \nSock/Tiafoe win match, 4-6, 7-6 (2), 11-9!\n\nThird-set match tiebreaker: Federer/Nadal 9-11 Sock/Tiafoe\nAnd the Americans blink again as a forced error puts them down a minibreak. Federer to serve at 9-8 with the match on his racket! But Tiafoe pulls it out of the fire after the changeover, winning the next point for 9-all. Federer with one more serve ... but Tiafoe responds with an absolutely thunderous forehand return winner. Match point for Team World with Sock serving at 10-9 ... and after a lengthy rally Sock ends it with a forehand winner into the corner. It\u2019s over!\n\n\nUpdated at 12.41am BST\n\n\n 12.21am  \n\nThird-set match tiebreaker: Federer/Nadal 8-8 Sock/Tiafoe* (*denotes next server)\nThe Americans stay on serve behind another big Sock second serve. Now it\u2019s Nadal with the next two points on his racket serving at 6-7. Federer slots a forehand winner at the end of a tense rally for 7-all, sending the crowd into roars. But Tiafoe rips a forehand directly into Nadal\u2019s back to put Team World up a minibreak, drawing murmurs of consternation from the crowd. Tiafoe serving at 8-7 ... and a missed backhand by Tiafoe puts them back on serve at 8-all!\n\n\n\n 12.17am  \n\nThird-set match tiebreaker: Federer/Nadal 6-6 Sock/Tiafoe* (*denotes next server)\nFederer/Nadal win the next two points behind Federer\u2019s big serve. Sock with the next two points on his racket serving at 5-6. Federer overcooks a return and they\u2019ll change ends knotted at 6-all. First to 10 points, remember.\n\n\n\n 12.15am  \n\nThird-set match tiebreaker: *Federer/Nadal 4-5 Sock/Tiafoe (*denotes next server)\nAn unbelievable scoop-shot winner by Sock at the net puts the Americans ahead by a minibreak. He pumps his fist and screams in disbelief while playing to the crowd. Tiafoe with the first of two points on his racket at 4-3 ... and a Federer winner puts them back on serve at 4-all. A sliding winner as Sock loses his footing at the net keeps them there. Federer to serve at 4-5.\n\n\n\n 12.12am  \n\nThird-set match tiebreaker: *Federer/Nadal 3-3 Sock/Tiafoe (*denotes next server)\nIt\u2019s 10 minutes past midnight in London as the final stretch of Roger Federer\u2019s career is under way. Sock and Tiafoe blink first, quickly going down a minibreak on the first point. Nadal and Federer follow with winners and Sock faces an early pressure point serving at love-3. He answers with a booming ace then forces Nadal into an error. Then forced error on Nadal\u2019s serve gives the American another minibreak and levels the match at 3-all at the changeover.\n\n\n\n 12.07am  \nSock/Tiafoe win second set 7-6 (2)!\n\nSecond set: Federer/Nadal 6-4, 6-7 (2-7) Sock/Tiafoe\nA couple of loose points on the Federer serve and suddenly Sock and Tiafoe have four set points. And they need only one. Federer is forced into an error and we\u2019re headed to a first-to-10 tiebreaker to decide this match!\n\nUpdated at 12.08am BST\n\n\n 12.04am  \n\nSecond set tiebreaker: Federer/Nadal 2-4 Sock/Tiafoe* (*denotes next server)\nTeam Europe goes down a minibreak again on another unforced error by Nadal. They win the next point and now Sock will serve at 3-2. Another forced error at the end of a long rally makes it 4-2 to Sock/Tiafoe with the next point on their racket after the change of ends.\n\n\n\n 12.01am  \n\nSecond set tiebreaker: *Federer/Nadal 1-2 Sock/Tiafoe (*denotes next server)\nFederer serves to start but Tiafoe conjures another massive return winner to immediately give Team World the early minibreak. Nadal, whose level has dropped, nets a backhand at the net, but a forced error by Sock puts them back on serve. Nadal to serve at 1-2.\n\n\n\n 11.58pm  \n\nSecond set: Federer/Nadal 6-4, 6-6 Sock/Tiafoe \nSock cracks an ace to open his service game but a Federer winner makes it 15-all. A trade of points makes it 30-all and Federer and Nadal are two points from the finish line once more. Another trade of forced errors pushes it to deuce. Then Tiafoe follows with a deft forehand winner at the net before a netted backhand by Federer gifts Sock and Tiafoe the hold. We\u2019re headed to a second-set breaker!\n\n\n\n 11.52pm  \n\nSecond set: Federer/Nadal 6-4, 6-5 Sock/Tiafoe* (*denotes next server)\nNadal falls behind love-15 on his serve on a sharp return by Tiafoe. The opportunity widens after Tiafoe punds a backhand winner for love-30, then further still after winning the next exchange for love-40 and triple break point. The Federer/Nadal team saved the first and second on a couple of forced errors, then the third when Sock frames a forehand on the approach and sends it past the baseline. Deuce. A forced error pushes Federer/Nadal to the brink of the game, but Tiafoe hits a sizzling forehand winner for deuce number two. An untimely Nadal double fault then gives Sock/Tiafoe a fourth look at a break, but Federer erases it with a forehand winner. A fifth break chance follows moments later, but Tiafoe can\u2019t handle a Nadal\u2019s forehand missle and we\u2019re back to deuce. An electric rally covering every inch of the court follows, maybe the point of the match, and Sock ends it with a backhand winner for a sixth break-point chance in this game, which is now past the 10-minute mark. And that one is saved too when Sock nets a forehand. From there Nadal holds, winning the last two points on a couple of unforced errors by the Americans. Whew!\n\n\n\n 11.41pm  \n\nSecond set: *Federer/Nadal 6-4, 5-5 Sock/Tiafoe (*denotes next server)\nAfter winning two quick points, Tiafoe double-faults for 30-15. Then Sock nets a forehand at the net and suddenly Federer and Nadal are two points from the finish line at 30-all. But they\u2019re able to escape with the hold after Nadal makes an unforced error and Sock closes it out with an overhand smash.\n\n\n\n 11.36pm  \n\nSecond set: Federer/Nadal 6-4, 5-4 Sock/Tiafoe* (*denotes next server)\nAnother moment of pressure on Federer\u2019s serve as a Tiafoe winner at the net pushes it to 30-all from 30-love. A trade of unforced errors gets it to deuce, but Federer holds comfortably from there. Tiafoe will serve to stay in the match after the change of ends.\n\n\n\n 11.32pm  \n\nSecond set: *Federer/Nadal 6-4, 4-4 Sock/Tiafoe (*denotes next server)\nSock races out to 40-love on his serve before double-faulting, then nailing down the hold on the next point.\n\n\n\n 11.31pm  \n\nSecond set: Federer/Nadal 6-4, 4-3 Sock/Tiafoe* (*denotes next server)\nNadal backs up the break for Team Europe with a stress-free hold. The intensity of this match has markedly gone up in the last quarter hour.\n\n\n\n\n 11.28pm  \n\nFederer/Nadal break in sixth game of second set!\nSecond set: *Federer/Nadal 6-4, 3-3 Sock/Tiafoe (*denotes next server)\nTiafoe falls behind love-15 then 15-30 on his serve. He then double-faults for the first time in the match and suddenly Federer and Nadal have two opportunities to break back. And they need only one. Fedal win a lightly disputed point when Tiafoe appears to hit the ball twice. Team Europe have the break and we\u2019re back on serve in the second.\n\n\n\n 11.22pm  \n\nSecond set: Federer/Nadal 6-4, 3-2 Sock/Tiafoe* (*denotes next server)\nFederer is pushed to 30-all on his serve, but a couple of unforced errors by Sock and Tiafoe see the Europeans through to the hold.\n\n\n\n 11.18pm  \n\nSecond set: *Federer/Nadal 6-4, 2-2 Sock/Tiafoe (*denotes next server)\nAnd now the pressure immediately swings to the Team World as Sock, who is playing his fourth set of the day, goes down 15-30 on his serve. He then nets a running forehand from the baseline early in a rally for 15-40, giving the Federer/Nadal team a pair of break points. The Americans erase the first, then the second, for deuce. But another overcooked forehand by Sock that leaves him wincing at the baseline gifts Federer and Nadal a third look at a break point. The European team can\u2019t convert that one, either: Federer badly frames a return from outside the court. From there Sock and Tiafoe get out with the hold thanks to some deft net play.\n\n\n\n\n 11.09pm  \n\nSock/Tiafoe break in third game of second set!\nSecond set: Federer/Nadal 6-4, 1-2 Sock/Tiafoe* (*denotes next server)\nSuddenly an opening for Sock and Tiafoe. They win two quick points on Nadal\u2019s serve, then Tiafoe crushes a winner off the ground for love-40 and three break-point chances. Nadal brushes aside the first with a forehand winner early in a rally, then the second with a 115mph ace down the middle. But Sock/Tiafoe strike on the third when Sock pounces on a second serve and Federer\u2019s stab at the net sends the ball sailing past the baseline.\n\n\n\n 11.04pm  \n\nSecond set: *Federer/Nadal 6-4, 1-1 Sock/Tiafoe (*denotes next server)\nAnother pressure point for the American pair at 30-all on Tiafoe\u2019s racket. But the US Open semi-finalist serves his way out of trouble, rattling off two quick points including a sizzling ace out wide to escape with the hold.\n\n\n\n 11.03pm  \n\nSecond set: Federer/Nadal 6-4, 1-0 Sock/Tiafoe* (*denotes next server)\n\u201cYou got a little bit caught up in the hoopla,\u201d Team World captain John McEnroe tells Sock and Tiafoe during the setbreak. \u201cI mean, it\u2019s a beautiful thing but it\u2019s even more beautiful if you win it.\u201d Federer serves to open the set and it\u2019s an uncomplicated hold of serve to start things off.\n\n\n\n 10.55pm  \nFederer/Nadal win first set, 6-4!\n\nFederer/Nadal break in 10th game of first set!\nFirst set: Federer/Nadal 6-4 Sock/Tiafoe\nTiafoe goes down love-15 on his serve. He follows with another booming ace for 15-all, but a gorgeous inside-out winner by Nadal followed by an unforced error get Federer and Nadal to deuce on the Team World serve for the first time tonight. The first pressure point of the day for the American duo. And Nadal answers with a forehand volley winner at the net into the alleyway and Team Europe have their first break-point opportunity of the match only moments after facing down their first. And they convert it! Sock sends a fairly simply backhand folley into the net early in a rally and Federer/Nadal have the break and the opening set!\n\nUpdated at 11.00pm BST\n\n\n 10.50pm  \n\nFirst set: Federer/Nadal 5-4 Sock/Tiafoe* (*denotes next server)\nThe first pressure point of the match is on Nadal\u2019s racket at 4-4, 30-30. And a backhand unforced error makes it 30-40, giving Sock and Tiafoe the first break-point chance of the match for either side. But Federer and Nadal rattle off three quick points from there with the Swiss capping the hold with a sharply angled volley winner at the net.\n\n\n\n 10.46pm  \n\nFirst set: *Federer/Nadal 4-4 Sock/Tiafoe (*denotes next server)\nAnother drama-free hold for Sock and we\u2019re still on serve in the opener.\n\n\n\n 10.43pm  \n\nFirst set: Federer/Nadal 4-3 Sock/Tiafoe* (*denotes next server)\nChants of \u201cLet\u2019s go Roger, let\u2019s go!\u201d ring through the O2 Arena as Federer steps to the baseline for his second turn on serve. He\u2019s pressured a bit this time after an unforced error pushes it to 40-30, then a second serve. But Nadal bails them out with a volley at the net to nail down the hold. Says the Spaniard during the changeover: \u201cIt\u2019s unbelievable when you don\u2019t play doubles how slow you are on the net.\u201d\n\n\nUpdated at 10.46pm BST\n\n\n 10.39pm  \n\nFirst set: *Federer/Nadal 3-3 Sock/Tiafoe (*denotes next server)\nTiafoe breezes through another service game to keep pace with the Federer-Nadal pair. No real moments of danger in any of the six games so far.\n\n\n\n\n 10.34pm  \n\nFirst set: Federer/Nadal 3-2 Sock/Tiafoe* (*denotes next server)\nNadal holds for Team Europe. Federer has overcome some early nerves and is firmly in the match. Elsewhere, the newly minted world No 1 is among the worldwide TV audience of millions.\n\n\n\n\n 10.29pm  \n\nFirst set: *Federer/Nadal 2-2 Sock/Tiafoe (*denotes next server)\nA quick hold for Sock and all four players have held their opening service games.\n\n\n\n 10.26pm  \n\nFirst set: Federer/Nadal 2-1 Sock/Tiafoe* (*denotes next server)\nFederer holds comfortably in his opening service game, despite losing a point where he managed to hit the ball through this gap between the net and the net post. Even at 41, he\u2019s doing things we\u2019ve never seen before.\n\n\nUpdated at 10.44pm BST\n\n\n 10.20pm  \n\nFirst set: *Federer/Nadal 1-1 Sock/Tiafoe (*denotes next server)\nSock and Tiafoe cruise to a stress-free hold in their opening service game. Tiafoe, fresh off his inspired run to the US Open semi-finals which included a career-best win over Nadal in the fourth round, punctuates it with a booming ace.\n\nUpdated at 10.22pm BST\n\n\n 10.16pm  \n\nFirst set: Federer/Nadal 1-0 Sock/Tiafoe* (*denotes next server)\nNadal is first to serve and he opens with a double fault. The ball was called in but a Tiafoe challenge overturned it. Federer then hits a forehand volley winner at the net early in a rally for 15-all, prompting another ovation. It could be a long night at this rate. Nadal makes it 30-15 with a lunging backhand volley into the alleyway before holding after a couple of errors by the Sock/Tiafoe team. A tidy hold for the crowd favorites after the double fault to start.\n\n\n\n 10.09pm  \n\nFederer and Nadal have just emerged from the tunnel to an extended standing ovation at a jam-packed O2 Arena. They\u2019re trailed by Team Europe coach Bj\u00f6rn Borg. They\u2019ve now taken the court for their warm-up, trading shots with the American pair of Jack Sock and Frances Tiafoe (who shared a court with Nadal not so long ago).\nTwo minutes to go.\n\n\nUpdated at 10.11pm BST\n\n\n 10.03pm  \n\nThe tributes have poured in from all over the world in the eight days since Federer announced his retirement. The great German footballer Philipp Lahm added to the pile with this thoughtful column in today\u2019s Guardian.\n\nFederer\u2019s career path forms a stark contrast to the present. In times of professionalisation, young athletes are often treated like investments \u2013 especially in sports where there is a lot to earn, like tennis. At a young age, they are sent to academies and camps, which are talent factories. Athletes\u2019 biographies are increasingly created outside the federation, outside society. They are privatised.\nThe entertainment industry of sport sees talent as a resource and a capital investment. As soon as it has identified the talent, it becomes a project. You take it out of the structures, do your own thing. The goal of the athlete is no longer to give something back to the community, but to optimise profit and build a business.\nBecause more and more people imitate this, many end up falling by the wayside. Talent is a rare gift. This is how sport distances itself from society. If it is no longer part of it, it loses its charm and credibility.\nOn Friday, the world can marvel at the genius of Federer one last time. It\u2019s time to get nostalgic. Many Federer moments come to mind. I often think of the spring of 2017, when he experienced a resurgence after many injuries. He won Indian Wells and Miami. In Australia he beat Nadal in the fifth set despite being behind.\nIt was the time when I ended my career. I was happy that Federer continued and I watched all his matches then \u2013 it was a wonderful pastime. He proved his prowess to everyone again. That\u2019s how I will remember Roger Federer.\n\n\nFederer and Nadal alternated between their courtside dugout with the rest of their Team Europe team-mates and backstage during the Murray-De Minaur match. \n\nNot much longer now. The players should be on court for tonight\u2019s feature attraction momentarily.\n\n\n\n 9.52pm  \n\nAlex de Minaur has won 5-7, 6-3, 7-10 over Andy Murray in a first-to-10 match tiebreak. A bit of a slow starter, but it featured some very high quality over the last half hour. In fighting back from a set down, the 23-year-old Aussie has delivered a desperately needed point for Team World, who did not want to fall into a 3-0 hole right out of the gate.\n\n\n\n\n 9.37pm  \n\nA quick refresher on the Laver Cup format and where things stand ahead of tonight\u2019s nightcap. A team-based, three-day event conceived as an equivalent to golf\u2019s Ryder Cup, the competition consists of three singles and one doubles match daily. One point is awarded per win on day one, two points per win on day two and three points per win on day three.\nTeam Europe have won all four editions so far, though the title was decided in the 12th and final match on two occasions. Federer clinched the trophy in 2017 and Alexander Zverev did the same in 2019.\nThe Europeans are already out to a 2-0 lead in this year\u2019s event after Casper Ruud and Stefanos Tsitsipas pocketed singles wins in today\u2019s afternoon session over Jack Sock and Diego Schwartzman, respectively.\n\nFederer, Nadal and Novak Djokovic are all playing on Team Europe together for the first time. The Big Three, as they are widely known, have combined to win 63 of the last 77 grand slam championships (Nadal 22, Djokovic 21, Federer 20).\nDe Minaur has just taken the second set in his ongoing match with Murray. Under the rules, the match will be decided by a 10-point tiebreaker rather than a full third set, meaning tonight\u2019s main event should be off and running by the top of the hour.\n\nUpdated at 10.05pm BST\n\n\n 9.25pm  \nPrelude\n\nHello and welcome to the O2 Arena for the final match of Roger Federer\u2019s storied career. The 41-year-old Swiss great, who hasn\u2019t competed since a quarter-final loss at Wimbledon to Hubert Hurkacz in July 2021, announced last week that he\u2019s walking away from professional tennis following a series of operations on his right knee that made his long-sought comeback to the men\u2019s tour untenable.\nAnd so he\u2019s bidding farewell tonight in London at the team event founded by his management company alongside his longtime rival and friend Rafael Nadal. The twosome are due to compete for Team Europe against the Team World doubles pairing of Frances Tiafoe and Jack Sock.\nIt\u2019s not the first time Federer and Nadal have featured on the same side of the court: they won a doubles match together in the first edition of the Laver Cup back in 2017. But they are far better known for their roles in one of the great rivalries in the history of sport. They\u2019ve met a total of 40 times in singles (with Nadal winning 26), including 14 times at grand slam tournaments (with the Spaniard winning 10), none more memorable than their epochal showdown in the 2008 Wimbledon final.\n\u201cI saw him playing on TV before I arrived on tour. I saw him having success on TV, and then (we were) able to create an amazing rivalry together,\u201d Nadal said yesterday. \u201cAnd on the other hand, something that probably we are very proud of is having a friendly rivalry. Tomorrow is going to be a special thing. Difficult. Going to be difficult to handle everything, especially for Roger, without a doubt. But for me, too. At the end, one of the most important players \u2013 if not the most important player \u2013 in my tennis career is leaving.\u201d\n\nFederer and Nadal will take the court after the conclusion of the night\u2019s first fixture, a singles meeting between Team Europe\u2019s Andy Murray and Team World\u2019s Alex de Minaur that\u2019s currently in the second set.\n\n\n\n 9.15pm  \n\nBryan will be here shortly. In the meantime here\u2019s Tumaini Carayol\u2019s lookahead to Federer\u2019s swansong tonight in London.\n\nRoger Federer, Rafael Nadal, Novak Djokovic and Andy Murray \u2013 a group of the three greatest men\u2019s tennis players of all time and the four defining competitors of the generation \u2013 were packed tightly together for their Laver Cup press conference on Thursday, when they all converged for the final time as professionals.\nAs they reminisced on their old matches and laughed about shared memories, glorious or devastating depending on the perspective, Federer interjected: \u201cSitting here, it feels good that I go first from the guys,\u201d he said, smiling. \u201cIt just feels right.\u201d\nIn many ways this final chapter of Federer\u2019s career is bleak. Despite his reputation for avoiding serious injury through his career, his final years have been ravaged by physical problems. Unlike the recent intense, competitive departure of Serena Williams Federer cannot trust his knee to last more than one short doubles match. In his final bout alongside Nadal, his Team Europe teammate, he will enter the O2 Arena against Team World\u2019s Frances Tiafoe and Jack Sock on Friday night simply hoping to compete at a respectable level.\nBut the circumstances are fitting. He will be seen off by three of the toughest opponents of his life, players who with him have defined this past decade and a half of tennis, pushing it forward in so many ways. Between them they have won 66 grand slam titles, faced off against each other 234 times and spent 933 weeks at No 1. For over a decade they packed out the later stages of each major event and blocked nearly all others from succeeding.\n\u201cTomorrow\u2019s gonna be a special thing,\u201d said Nadal. \u201cI think very difficult, difficult one. Gonna be difficult to handle everything, especially for Roger, without a doubt. For me too. At the end one of the most important players, if not most important player in my tennis career, is leaving, no?\u201d\n\n\n\n"

                    "body": "Less than a year ago, New Zealand felt yet another global trophy slip from their grasp as Australia mowed down a decent chase of 173 without breaking a sweat in the 2021 final. To start this year\u2019s T20 World Cup, the Kiwis laid into Australia with an extra level of ferocity, racking up 200 for the cost of only three wickets before defending it with aplomb. Holding the chase to just 111 closed out the first upset of the Super 12 stage and put a severe dent in the home team\u2019s tournament plans. It was the young opener Finn Allen who introduced the cat to Australian pigeons. Facing up to Patrick Cummins, Mitchell Starc and Josh Hazlewood would be an intimidating option for any Test opener, but Allen took on all of them within the first three overs. He took Starc down the ground, Hazlewood through cover, and Cummins over square leg. After facing 13 of the 18 balls bowled, he had 35 runs and New Zealand had 46. Another monster straight hit off Marcus Stoinis took Allen to 42 from 16 balls by the time Hazlewood hit his stumps.  The performance wasn\u2019t entirely surprising, given Allen\u2019s exploits in the shortest format across Australia and England. He currently scores at 166.99 per hundred balls in T20 Internationals, and 171.57 across all T20 cricket. That leaves him fifth-highest in history on both lists with a minimum of 250 balls faced. In all T20s, nobody who has faced 400 balls has scored higher than Allen, who has faced 1,189. He is the most consistently fast scorer in the world and has the chance to carry New Zealand a long way in the tournament. That gave Devon Conway the perfect start and he carried it through the innings with a peerless 92 from 58 balls. He produced inventive glides and a series of perfectly placed drives against the fast bowlers, while repeatedly targeting leg-spinner Adam Zampa for big hits down the ground. \u201cIt was pretty special,\u201d said Conway after the match. \u201cI\u2019ve seen [Allen] do it time and time again. He\u2019s fearless, and credit has to go to him. The way Finn plays his game complements my game, I knew that I could just play my game and bat around him.\u201d  Zampa foxed the New Zealand captain, Kane Williamson, with a loopy delivery that hit him in front of the stumps for 23, and Hazlewood took a top edge from Glenn Phillips (12 runs) and completed the catch, but that didn\u2019t slow down Conway. James Neesham also played his part to perfection with four overs to play, battering 26 from 13 balls including a six from the final ball of the innings. Australia generally fancy chasing big totals, but it has to start from the top. David Warner edged Trent Boult for a boundary before deflecting a Tim Southee delivery onto his stumps having scored just five runs. Aaron Finch and Mitchell Marsh threatened for a moment, Finch sending Southee soaring over the leg side and Marsh scoring six of his own over extra cover from Mitchell Santner. But New Zealand\u2019s left-arm spinner had Finch (13) caught at cover in the same over, then Marsh (16) lifted Southee to Neesham at deep midwicket.  That left the job up to Stoinis and Glenn Maxwell, who were tied down by a furiously fast over from Lockie Ferguson and an accurate one from Santner. Another piece of New Zealand brilliance knocked out Stoinis, caught at deep cover by an airborne Phillips who was up and celebrating almost as soon as his flight path had intersected with the ground. That left Australia needing 150 from 70 balls. Tim David fetched one six off Santner from outside off-stump before perishing trying to replicate it, and while Maxwell set about lashing 28 runs in quick time, including turning himself into a left-hander to lever Ish Sodhi into the second tier of the grandstand, Matthew Wade soon edged Ferguson behind and the game was gone. Boult and Southee cleaned up the tail, Boult finishing with two for 24 from his full allotment, while Southee claimed an absurd three for six from 13 deliveries. Santner was the most expensive with three for 31, while Ferguson and Sodhi each took a wicket. Of Australia\u2019s bowling, conversely, the most economical was Starc at nine runs per over. In a group stage where only two teams will progress to the knockout phase, New Zealand now have the upper hand, and Australia finding a way to beat the English favourites is now vital."

                    "body": "A mere 2,155 days after the US women\u2019s soccer team filed a complaint with the USA\u2019s Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and 1,082 days since the team filed a lawsuit against US Soccer, the team and the federation announced a settlement on Tuesday. Unusually for legal action, the terms of the settlement were immediately made public: $24m, with $2m of that money earmarked for \u201cUSWNT players in their post-career goals and charitable efforts related to women\u2019s and girls\u2019 soccer.\u201d Now comes the hard part.  The deal is contingent on the ratification of a new contract between the federation and the players. That new contract is tied up in part because US Soccer president Cindy Cone has insisted that the men\u2019s and women\u2019s national teams come together with the federation to figure out the pesky problem of how to pay both national teams equally when Fifa\u2019s prize money for World Cups is hugely unequal \u2013 $440m for the men in 2022 against a proposed $60m for the women in 2023.  On a related note, all parties that take women\u2019s soccer seriously would very much like Fifa to even out that prize money. Today. Yesterday. It\u2019s money Fifa could afford to, considering the organization made around $3.5bn in profit from the 2018 World Cup alone. \u201cWe\u2019re not wondering if the women\u2019s game can make money,\u201d Megan Rapinoe said of Fifa on a Tuesday conference call. \u201cIt\u2019s just willful discrimination and willful negligence.\u201d Since 2018, the US men have been playing under the terms of an expired collective bargaining agreement. The women agreed in December to extend their current deal through March.   Players on Tuesday\u2019s conference call said they\u2019ve been working with the men\u2019s team on CBA talks, and Becky Sauerbrunn noted that lawyers have been coming up with creative proposals. But representatives for the men\u2019s players association did not return a request for comment from the Guardian, nor has the association posted anything on its Twitter feed, which instead focused on the match-up of two USMNT stars in the Champions League tie between Chelsea (Christian Pulisic) and Lille (Timothy Weah).  The lawsuit settlement seems rather generous given the team\u2019s losses in court. Last year, US district judge R Gary Klausner granted a partial summary judgment in favor of the federation, accepting the argument that the women had actually been paid more than the men, albeit in a cycle in which the World Cup champion women were considerably more successful than their male counterparts, who failed to qualify for the 2018 World Cup.  A more damning argument: In their 2017 collective bargaining agreement, the women had accepted not just a different pay scale but a completely different structure. Given the lack of professional opportunities throughout most of women\u2019s soccer\u2019s history, the federation has long paid salaries and benefits to most of the team\u2019s most frequent players. Klausner wrote that the women\u2019s team rejected an offer to go to the men\u2019s \u201cpay-to-play\u201d structure and therefore couldn\u2019t \u201cretroactively deem their CBA worse.\u201d And even if the men and women manage to coordinate on their CBAs, the teams will still have some differences. Sauerbrunn said on Tuesday that the team still wants to negotiate issues such as maternity leave, which will be tricky as coach Vlatko Andonovski expands the player pool rather than following the precedent of sticking with the same faces. On the other hand, from the federation\u2019s point of view, $24m is certainly less than $67m, the figure cited by an economist filing a brief on behalf of the women\u2019s team. Cone, herself a longtime player for the national team, argued that such a payout \u201cwould likely bankrupt the federation.\u201d That dramatic statement might not be literally true. The pandemic and other factors brought the federation\u2019s spending plans to a screeching halt and, paradoxically, resulted in a surplus in the fiscal year ending March 2021. The federation, which had previously planned to spend that pile of assets down to $42m by March 2023, is now targeting $102m by that date. But the federation has a lot on its plate, not the least of which is building up national teams that have either aged (women) or underachieved (men). Since landing a $50m windfall with the hosting of the Copa America Centenario in 2016, US Soccer has been under pressure to invest in many areas \u2013 coaching education, extended national teams (disability soccer, beach soccer, futsal), the US Open Cup (including a new competition for women) and grassroots grants programs.  The settlement also surely removes a sizable chunk of legal fees from the budget, though the federation still faces interminable lawsuits from the NASL and sports promoter Relevent Sports \u2013 both represented by Jeffrey Kessler, who also represents the US women and once represented MLS players in an ill-fated legal action against the league and federation. Also still suing the federation \u2013 Hope Solo, the longtime US women\u2019s goalkeeper who wound up going her own way in court. Perhaps most important of all for the federation is a rare bit of good PR, or at least an interruption in the drumbeat of bad PR. The women found little trouble attracting sympathetic reporters, influencers and documentarians who eschewed numbers and even touted \u201cequal pay\u201d deals in other countries that are, in fact, not equal and pay both men and women considerably less than US Soccer does.  \u201cManagement,\u201d even when it\u2019s a volunteer-driven nonprofit, is never the popular side in a labor dispute. The federation\u2019s former legal team and former president Carlos Cordeiro took that bad hand and made it worse. Cordeiro was tone-deaf in public statements, even at a parade for the women after their 2019 championship. The legal team argued that women lacked not just the speed and strength of men\u2019s players but also the skill and effort, an argument that was all the more insulting because it was hardly necessary, given the strength of the federation\u2019s other arguments. Cordeiro is running again for his old gig, and Rapinoe noted on Tuesday\u2019s call that he didn\u2019t have her vote. She doesn\u2019t officially have a vote, but Sauerbrunn and Morgan do, along with several recent national team players who are part of the Athletes Council. The settlement surely bolsters Cone\u2019s case for re-election. But she still has to deal with negotiations with men\u2019s and women\u2019s players who have grown accustomed to being paid more than their peers. Cone is hopeful things will be nailed down before the women\u2019s extension expires on 31 March. \u201cAre we close?\u201d Cone said on Tuesday\u2019s call. \u201cIt depends on your definition of close. Are we going in the right direction? Yes.\u201d"

                    "body": "After two years of trauma, it would be an exaggeration to say Melbourne is back to normal. Streets are peppered with For Lease signs and reminders of what was lost to the pandemic (loved ones, livelihoods, favourite local haunts). But one industry is unquestionably booming. From excited crowds trekking to regional grounds to watch women\u2019s footy to bitter rivalries over the willow at the \u2019G, spectator sport is back with a vengeance. Sending the AFL on a Queensland holiday doesn\u2019t seem to have affected our desire to get amongst it one bit, with the grand final between Geelong and Sydney attracting the largest crowd in decades. Meanwhile, more than 90,000 people descended on the MCG to watch a match for the ages between Pakistan and India as part of the ICC T20 World Cup.   Even the Formula 1, which has been troubled by low ticket numbers and alienating people who aren\u2019t models and/or billionaires, attracted record numbers earlier in the year. Australian Open crowds were rowdy and antisocial, sure, but they were plentiful, and they didn\u2019t euthanise any living creatures to my knowledge. Which brings us to Tuesday, and the annual pilgrimage to the David Jones millinery department followed by a quick trip to Flemington to lose your shoes. When the Maribyrnong River broke its banks a few weeks ago, swamping neighbourhoods with rising brown water, Flemington Racecourse gleamed emerald behind its flood wall. It\u2019s the most recent reminder of horse racing\u2019s gross chokehold on this otherwise quite good city, but far from the only. As if we needed another reason to turn our attention away from the Cup. As if it hasn\u2019t alienated itself enough with its wake of rubbish, predatory gambling and a race that too often ends with a horse hidden behind a curtain.  Melburnians had been voting with their feet \u2013 Cup attendance numbers declined 26% from 2010 to 2019. TV ratings have also plunged to record lows, as public sentiment on animal cruelty, predatory gambling ads and violence plummets. Why wouldn\u2019t we demand better? This is Melbourne, friends. The sporting capital of the world, where conversations must begin \u201cWhat school did you go to?\u201d and \u201cWhat team do you go for?\u201d. A city still mourning Shane Warne \u2013 heck, a city still mourning Peter Brock \u2013 but that can\u2019t remember the names of horses that died in seven of the past eight Melbourne Cups. We are flush with chances to witness victories, to battle for the underdog, to cheer for the winner, to rush the field, to bring oranges at half-time, to sing the club song, to spray another rich man with champagne on a podium. It runs in our blood and, to absolutely whip the analogy to death, it gets to go home to the stables afterwards. In a city where sport is religion and seasons are determined by the shape of the ball, surely we can find something better to watch than the final moments of a beautiful animal bred for profit?"

                    "body": "Sarina Wiegman said England have taken \u201clots of information\u201d from their 3-1 victory against Germany \u2013 only their second in 27 attempts \u2013 and inaugural Arnold Clark Cup win but will not get carried away before the European Championship in the summer. \u201cThis was a step towards the Euros,\u201d the England manager said. \u201cWe will stay neutral. This was successful. We have grown a lot but we know the opponents in the Euros will be too. We weren\u2019t tight enough on the ball so that was hard for us but then you can come back to your fundamentals. I am happy with this tournament. We got lots of information about ourselves and where we are in our style of play.\u201d With draws against Canada and Spain, England topped the standings in the friendly tournament based on goal difference, after finishing level on five points with Spain. Ellen White scored the opening goal in front of 13,463 fans to join Sir Bobby Charlton on 49 goals for England and to move within four goals of Wayne Rooney\u2019s record.  Her effort was cancelled out by Lina Magull\u2019s powerful free-kick in the first half, but Millie Bright\u2019s poached strike on the rebound after a mazy run and shot from Lauren Hemp helped England towards three points and Fran Kirby added the flourish with a blistering goal on the counterattack in added time.  The sight of the defender Bright posing with a golden boot alongside the Ballon d\u2019Or, Fifa Best and Uefa player of the year winner, Alexia Putellas, after scoring her second goal of the tournament was a strange one. Wiegman had said it did not matter who was scoring for England, as long as the team were, but Bright\u2019s volley against Canada was their only goal of the tournament before this game. Against a depleted Germany, with 12 regular squad members unable to be called up because of injury or Covid, Alex Greenwood and Bright were partnered in defence, Chelsea\u2019s Jess Carter was shifted to left-back and Lucy Bronze was favoured, familiarly, on the right. Behind them, Manchester City\u2019s Ellie Roebuck was given the opportunity to attempt to win back her No 1 shirt, making her first start under Wiegman.  Almost instantly England\u2019s greatest threat, the fearless winger Hemp, went to work on the left, causing problems for the Bayern Munich defender Maximiliane Rall, but the breakthrough, 15 minutes in, came from a more tried and tested source. Georgia Stanway, operating as a No 10, neatly played in Kirby but her shot was intercepted by Jana Feldkamp who passed the ball straight back into the feet of the Chelsea forward. She sent White through the middle and the striker calmly slotted past Merle Frohms. It is impossible to write eight-time Euro winners off regardless of key absentees such as Alex Popp, Melanie Leupolz, Dzsenifer Marozs\u00e1n and Almuth Schult but it took a moment of brilliance to break through England\u2019s new steely backline. Magull\u2019s free-kick, courtesy of Greenwood\u2019s foul on Lea Sch\u00fcller just outside the box, was exactly that, smacking down off the underside of the bar and in. If there was any deflation at having conceded a second goal under Wiegman, there was consolation to be taken in the quality of the two strikes shipped in the past six days \u2013 a far cry from the scrappy and chaotic goals conceded before she arrived.  Changes were made at half-time in both of England\u2019s storm-swept Arnold Clark Cup games but here, in kinder climes, the Dutch manager did not ring the changes as readily \u2013 bar an enforced one in the 34th minute, with Rachel Daly coming on for the injured Carter. This tournament has very much been a chance for Wiegman and her staff to test partnerships, the versatility of players and formations, but this was the time to see how the closest first-choice starting XI available to her would cope in a competitive matchday scenario. With England struggling in the final third again, though, Stanway made way for the Arsenal winger Nikita Parris just past the hour mark, shifting Kirby more central. The impact was instant, with Parris injecting energy on the wing and the world-class Kirby far more effective stationed closer to White. Unwilling to be outdone by the Lionesses record goalscorer, in the 84th minute and with England in the ascendency, a sweeping run from Hemp ended with her shot deflecting off Feldkamp into the path of Bright who fired in to give England the lead.  \u201cWe wanted to get some extra energy in the game and score a goal. We needed an extra player up front, she\u2019s really strong, a good header of the ball and good with her feet. I know that\u2019s a risk, but it went our way,\u201d Wiegman said of Bright\u2019s presence up top late on. There was further cause for celebration when Kirby raced away, after a headed clearance from Bright, three minutes into six minutes of added time. Her shot squeezed past Frohms to confirm a first win against Germany on home soil and to maintain Wiegman\u2019s unbeaten record as England manager."

                    "body": " Russia has said that a US decision to supply advanced rocket systems and munitions to Ukraine was extremely negative and would increase the risk of a direct confrontation. Russian deputy foreign minister, Sergei Ryabkov, said that Moscow viewed US military aid to Ukraine \u201cextremely negatively\u201d. \u201cAttempts to present the decision as containing an element of \u2018self-restraint\u2019 are useless,\u201d Ryabkov said. \u201cThe fact that the United States, at the head of a group of states, is engaged in a purposeful pumping of weapons into the Kyiv regime is an obvious thing.\u201d US President Joe Biden has confirmed he will send the more advanced, longer-range rocket systems to Kyiv, a critical weapon that Ukrainian leaders have been asking for as they struggle to stall Russian progress in the Donbas region. The medium-range high mobility artillery rocket systems are part of a new $700m tranche of security assistance from the US. Serhiy Haidai, Ukraine\u2019s governor of Luhansk, has said that Russia now controls 70% of the city of Sievierodonetsk, which is the main crucible of Russia\u2019s attack at the present time, and a key objective if Russian forces are to control the whole of the Donbas region. Haidai posted to Telegram claiming that \u201cthe Russians control 70% of Sievierodonetsk. Ukrainian troops retreated to more advantageous, pre-prepared positions. Another part continues fighting inside the city.\u201d President Zelenskiy has blasted the \u201cmadness\u201d of bombing a chemical plant in Sievierodonetsk. \u201cGiven the presence of large-scale chemical production in Sievierodonetsk, the Russian army\u2019s strikes there, including blind air bombing, are just crazy.\u201d Local officials said a nitric acid tank was hit and posted images of pink smoke billowing. Zelenskiy said Ukraine\u2019s military forces have had some successes near Kherson and in parts of the Kharkiv region. The UK\u2019s ministry of defence latest assessment of the situation on the ground in Ukraine says: \u201cRussian ground operations remain tightly focused, with the weight of fire power concentrated within a small sector of Luhansk oblast. Over 30-31 May, fighting intensified in the streets of Sievierodonetsk, with Russian forces pushing closer to the town centre. Over half of the town is likely now occupied by Russian forces, including Chechen fighters. Beyond the Donbas, Russia continues to conduct long-range missile strikes against infrastructure across Ukraine.\u201d Overnight a video depicting children alleged to have been killed by Ukrainian forces in the Russian-occupied Donbas region of Ukraine was projected on to the US embassy in Moscow as part of a protest to coincide with International Children\u2019s Day. Germany will supply Ukraine with the IRIS-T air defence system, chancellor Olaf Scholz said, following pleas from Kyiv and German opposition parties to step up heavy weapons deliveries. Switzerland\u2019s government has vetoed Denmark\u2019s request to send Swiss-made armoured personnel carriers to Ukraine. Denmark votes today in a referendum asking the nation whether it wants to end its decades-long opt-out from common European Union defence policies. Denmark\u2019s foreign minister, Jeppe Kofod, has said he will ask parliament tomorrow for Denmark\u2019s support of the accession of Sweden and Finland to Nato. Ukraine is working on an international UN-led operation with naval partners to ensure a safe trade route for food exports, according to Ukraine\u2019s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, who said Russia was playing \u201chunger games with the world by blocking Ukrainian food exports\u201d. Pope Francis appealed to authorities to lift the block on wheat exports from Ukraine, saying the grain cannot be used as a \u201cweapon of war\u201d. The African Union warned EU leaders that Moscow\u2019s blockade of Ukraine\u2019s ports risked \u201ca catastrophic scenario\u201d of food shortages and price rises. Senegal\u2019s president, Macky Sall, who chairs the union, said \u201cthe worst is perhaps ahead of us\u201d if current global food supply trends continued. Ukraine would prosecute 80 suspected war criminals, said the prosecutor general, Iryna Venediktova. Representatives of a group of countries investigating Russian war crimes have met with the international criminal court prosecutor, Karim Khan, at The Hague. A senior Russian lawmaker has suggested kidnapping a Nato defence minister. Oleg Morozov from the United Russia party said on Rossiya-1 state TV he had a \u201cfantastical plot\u201d that a Nato war minister would travel to Kyiv and wake up in Moscow. Sanctions against Russia are directed at ordinary citizens and motivated by hatred, the former president, Dmitry Medvedev, has said. Medvedev, who advises Vladimir Putin on national security, said on Telegram that the \u201cendless tango of economic sanctions\u201d won\u2019t touch the political elite but have brought losses for big business. Russia has further cut off gas supplies to Europe. Gazprom turned off the taps to a top Dutch trader and halted flows to some companies in Denmark and Germany. The intensification follows the EU\u2019s decision to place an embargo on most Russian oil imports. Ukraine\u2019s giant seed bank is in danger of being destroyed. The genetic code for nearly 2,000 crops rests in underground vaults based in Kharkiv, north-eastern Ukraine, which has come under intense bombing. Read more of the Guardian\u2019s coverage how vital seed banks are in the climate crisis here and here. Russia says it has has completed testing of its hypersonic Zircon cruise missile and will deploy it before the end of the year on a new frigate of its Northern Fleet. Ukraine will face Scotland tonight in what is set to be a highly-emotionally charged football match in Glasgow.

                    "body": "Sam Kerr has been labelled the complete centre forward by the Chelsea manager, Emma Hayes, after the Australia captain netted another double to help her side to a second piece of silverware in the space of a week. Having scored two sensational volleys last weekend to help secure the Women\u2019s Super League title with victory over Manchester United, Kerr was again on the scoresheet twice on Sunday as Chelsea won the Women\u2019s FA Cup final against Manchester City.  Kerr hit the game\u2019s opener in the first half and a 99th-minute winner \u2013 her seventh and eighth goals in four consecutive domestic cup finals \u2013 after Hayley Raso\u2019s late equaliser for City levelled the score and sent the game into extra-time.  Kerr\u2019s latest brace in front of a record crowd of 49,094 at Wembley completed a second extraordinary season in England for the Matildas captain, and left her manager in raptures. \u201cShe is ridiculous,\u201d Hayes said. \u201cShe\u2019s got the lot. She\u2019s got character, she\u2019s got charisma, charm, she\u2019s got courage in her play. We\u2019ve got an amazing centre forward. \u201cThere was a moment in the game when I thought, \u2018she looks knackered\u2019 but she just digs and digs and digs and digs and digs.\u201d Hayes added of Sunday\u2019s extra-time period, \u201cI always felt, \u2018give Sam one chance, just give her one chance\u2019.\u201d This season, Kerr won a second successive WSL golden boot, scoring 20 goals in 20 games, six clear of her nearest rival. She was voted Football Writers\u2019 Association women\u2019s footballer of the year and is favourite to win goal of the season for her title-clinching volley against United. She added another seven goals in cup competitions including three in finals to make it eight goals in four English domestic decider, three of them won. \u201cWE DID THAT!!,\u201d Kerr posted on Instagram after the dramatic contest at Wembley Stadium.  Hayes also praised Kerr for the job she did preventing City\u2019s defence, including Australia\u2019s Alanna Kennedy, playing the ball out from the back. It was an aspect noted by England international Izzy Christiansen, a former FA Cup winner with Manchester City. \u201cThe athleticism and hunger and desire, the desire to put yourself on the line and do anything you can for your team,\u201d the BBC television match pundit said. \u201cThe job Sam Kerr does off the ball for the team is remarkable. To have someone like that in your team is amazing.\u201d"

                    "body": "CANADA HOME AND DRY To paraphrase one of Chris Rock\u2019s greatest jokes, Will Smith ain\u2019t go crazy last night at the Oscars; Will Smith went Will Smith. Quite the spontaneous contemporary dance routine, though, huh? Remember, kids, violence is never the answer, especially if it\u2019s going to subject everyone to a full week of hot takes, polarised op-eds and memes. Oh Will! How could you! The Fiver is also sad that the incident has instantly become the most famous and notorious on-stage hand-jaw-interface scenario in history, eclipsing that time Jerry Sadowitz took to the stage in Montreal and opened with \u201cI tell you why I hate Canada, half of you speak French, and the other half let them\u201d with predictable consequences. Sadowitz an acquired taste, to be fair. But that\u2019s not the only reason our thoughts have turned to the Canadians, and seeing you\u2019re asking, yes this does register the maximum 11 on our patented Tenuousconvolutedintro-o-meter\u2122. That\u2019s because on Sunday night, Canada\u2019s men made it to the World Cup finals for the first time since 1986 (which is coincidentally the last time anybody paid any attention to the Academy Awards). John Herdman\u2019s swashbuckling counter-attacking side guaranteed their place in Qatar with a 4-0 rout of Jamaica, the cheese curds and gravy on an already delicious plate of steaming-hot fries that represent wins in Mexico and the USA! USA!! USA!!! as well as that Alphonso Davies goal against Panama, a combination of such speed and grace that it knocks even the work of your Gareth Bales and Mo Salahs into a c0cked straw hat.  Davies is the star man, though most of the plaudits are heading in the direction of Herdman, who already has done more than his bit for Canadian football, having led the women to a couple of bronze-medal finishes at Big Sports Day, setting them on a trajectory that saw them win gold under his former assistant Bev Preistman last year. The men were long overdue a contribution and they\u2019ve finally made it, the win over Jamaica guaranteeing a top-three finish in the Concacaf table. Most likely they\u2019ll be joined later this week by Mexico, for whom a draw in their final match at home against El Salvador will do, and the US, who will make it unless they lose by six goals or more in Costa Rica. Let\u2019s face it, rather like that dust-up at the Oscars, it\u2019s all over bar the shouting (and tweeting, releasing of press statements, candid interviews with Oprah, etc). QUOTE OF THE DAY \u201cMy dream is to see Ukraine and its people smile again. As long as I have the energy and I\u2019m healthy I\u2019ll never stop\u201d \u2013 iconic Dynamo Kyiv manager Mircea Lucescu tells Emanuel Rosu about the shocking first morning of the war in Ukraine, helping players get to Romania and his dream to lead his club again.

                    "body": "The owner of the Costcutter chain and one of the UK\u2019s largest grocery wholesalers has taken a near-\u00a3200m stake in Sainsbury\u2019s and said it could increase its position further. The company, which describes itself as the UK\u2019s seventh-largest family owned business with a turnover of \u00a34.5bn, has bought almost 81m shares, giving it a 3.45% stake in the UK\u2019s second-largest supermarket. However, the group said it intended to hold its shares in Sainsbury\u2019s \u201cfor investment purposes\u201d and added that it looked forward to \u201csupporting the executive management team\u201d.  Bestway said it \u201cmay look\u201d at purchasing more shares in the grocer, but this would be \u201csubject to availability and price\u201d. It said it was not considering making a takeover bid for Sainsbury\u2019s \u2013 a statement that bars it from such a move for six months, unless a rival bid emerges, under Takeover Panel rules. The move makes Bestway the sixth-largest shareholder in Sainsbury\u2019s. Alongside its wholesale business, Bestway owns the UK\u2019s third-largest pharmacy chain, Well Pharmacy, and more than 2,700 convenience stores under the Costcutter and Best-one brands. Bestway did not disclose how much it paid for the stake. However, at Sainsbury\u2019s closing price on Thursday of 239.4p, the stake was valued at \u00a3193m. Shares in Sainsbury\u2019s rose by as much as 4.5% on Friday, taking them to 250p, making the company one of the top risers on the FTSE 100. Sainsbury\u2019s said in a statement that it would \u201cengage with Bestway Group in line with our normal interactions with shareholders.\u201d Clive Black, an analyst at Shore Capital, said it was not clear if Bestway had \u201cthe aspirations or the resources\u201d to bid for Sainsbury\u2019s or whether, as a major grocery wholesaler and pharmacy business, it wanted to \u201ccollaborate with Sainsbury\u2019s from a trading perspective.\u201d Black said he was particularly surprised by Bestway\u2019s statement that it was potentially interested in buying more Sainsbury\u2019s shares. \u201cI\u2019ve been around a long time and not seen anything like this before. It\u2019s like saying \u2018here\u2019s a phone number, give us a ring\u2019,\u201d he said. Maureen Hinton, an independent retail analyst, said Bestway\u2019s stake could give it leverage in potential negotiations over the future of pharmacy outlets in Sainsbury\u2019s after the supermarket chain\u2019s current partner Lloyds Pharmacy announced plans to close all 237 outlets. \u201c[Bestway\u2019s] Well Pharmacy business would be a possible replacement for the Lloyds pharmacy exit,\u201d she said in a tweet. Sainsbury\u2019s already has two major shareholders on its register who might be interested in backing a privatisation \u2013 the Qatar Investment Authority, which owns just over 14% of the shares, and the billionaire Daniel K\u0159et\u00ednsk\u00fd, known as the \u201cCzech Sphinx\u201d, who holds about 10%. Any deal would need their blessing. Bestway\u2019s move is considered by some as demonstrating ongoing investor takeover interest in UK supermarkets, after the \u00a37bn takeover of Morrisons by the US private equity firm Clayton Dubilier &amp; Rice in late 2021, and the sale of Asda by the US retailer Walmart to the billionaire Issa brothers and the private equity firm TDR Capital. Sainsbury\u2019s currently has a 15.7% share of the UK grocery market, according to retail analysts Kantar, and recently reported successful Christmas trading, where its sales grew 7% from a year earlier. The retailer said it had benefited from customers splashing out on Christmas dinner, as well as strong sales at the Argos chain it owns. Bestway was founded in 1976 as a wholesale supplier by Sir Anwar Pervez, which the 87-year-old billionaire still chairs, and has become one of Britain\u2019s biggest wholesalers, serving thousands of retailers. The company can trace its origins back even further, to the convenience store Kashmir opened by Pervez in Earl\u2019s Court, west London, in 1963, just a few years after he left his native Pakistan for Britain, going on to carry out a range of jobs including as a bus conductor in Bradford. Bestway also owns the Well Pharmacy chain, which it bought from the Co-op in 2014. The company employs 28,000 people across the UK, the Middle East and Pakistan, where it has a stake in one of the country\u2019s largest banks and its second-biggest cement manufacturer. "

                    "body": "It was a landmark moment for women\u2019s football. Under the arch of Wembley stadium, to the soundtrack of Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s feminist anthem Run the World (Girls), more than 70,000 fans streamed in to watch Team GB take on Brazil in the London Olympics to result in what was then Britain\u2019s biggest ever women\u2019s football match. Team GB won 1-0 but that was almost (sort of) beside the point. The atmosphere was electric. In the crowd, where I was covering the match for the Evening Standard, the moment was a revelation. I couldn\u2019t believe there were so many women and girls. Not because they didn\u2019t belong \u2013 of course they did \u2013 but after a lifetime of hearing that women were rubbish at football and being made to feel that our views on the subject were unwelcome it felt completely wild.  But most striking of all was the mood. As well as \u201crocking\u201d and \u201ca night never to forget for women\u2019s football in this country\u201d, as player turned commentator Alex Scott, who was on the pitch that night, described it at the time, it was also convivial and friendly (and a sharp contrast to my only previous live football experience selling pies as a student at Carrow Road, Norwich City\u2019s ground). Despite breaking records \u2013 and proving that women\u2019s football could fill the home of football \u2013 many England players then still had day jobs. The Women\u2019s Super League (WSL) had yet to become fully professional. How the landscape has shifted in a decade. Now, as England prepares to host the women\u2019s Euros, which start on 6 July, with 450,000 tickets sold across the 25 days, it is already the biggest ever women\u2019s sporting event in Europe. Games will take place in 10 venues including Wembley, Old Trafford, Brighton and Hove community stadium and St Mary\u2019s in Southampton. Despite, so far at least, not having quite the same hype as the men\u2019s Euros last year, public appetite appears to be huge. England\u2019s three group matches (including the opening game at Old Trafford: capacity 71,300) and the final at Wembley (capacity 87,200) are already sold out. In fact, if everybody who has bought a ticket attends the final, it will mark the highest ever attendance for a men or women\u2019s game at the Euros. A total of 96,000 international visitors are expected, as well as a global broadcast audience of 250 million. So what has happened in the past 10 years? \u201cThe catalyst was the Olympics and that match,\u201d said Faye White, 44, England women\u2019s longest serving captain between 2002 and 2012. She also thinks it had a big impact on women\u2019s sport more generally. Then there was the triple heartache \u2013 first in the 2015 World Cup, coming third, then in the 2017 Euros when they lost to the Netherlands in the semi-finals and then, two years later in 2019, when they lost in the World Cup semis, this time to the US. Financial investment and the professionalisation of the game in 2018 have been essential to the shift, but White says increased media attention has also been crucial. \u201cDuring my career that was always the barrier.\u201d Now, she added, it\u2019s a regular fixture in sports news. England games are televised as well as many of the WSL games.  With an impressive squad the Lionesses are among the favourites to win and a manager with a winning record in their Dutch coach Sarina Wiegman (who reportedly implements strict rules: no quilted jackets or socks with sliders in team meetings) led the Netherlands to Euros victory in 2017 when they too were the host nation and got them to the 2019 World Cup final. For the first time at a major tournament they are using an app to monitor their menstrual cycles and Wiegman talks about the creation of a \u201csafe\u201d environment. \u201cShe makes you feel comfortable 100% but she\u2019s also someone I wouldn\u2019t want to cross,\u201d new England captain Leah Williamson, 25, said recently. Although there is still disparity between clubs, full-time pay and top staff and facilities make an enormous difference, White said. \u201cIn my time, and even before the WSL went professional, top players were having to get part-time jobs to support themselves.\u201d She added: \u201cIt is just a no-brainer really: when you can contribute 100% of your time in making sure that you get the best out of yourself in a sporting capacity it\u2019s a very big difference.\u201d Former England and Manchester United goalie Siobhan Chamberlain, who is working on a master\u2019s dissertation about the lack of women in leadership positions in football, said the game is in an exciting place.  \u201cThe game\u2019s at a turning point. This is the stepping stone to take it to that next level. But you\u2019ve got to be performing and winning on the pitch to get to that next level and I\u2019m sure the girls will feel that pressure but also revel in it.\u201d By \u201cnext level\u201d she means raising the bar across the league, not just among the top three of four teams. Also essential is filling stadiums. Although the big Euros games are sold out, that is often not the case for league games. \u201cYes, it\u2019s fantastic having exposure on TV platforms, having live games, and that\u2019s only going to help the game grow. But it also needs to turn into \u2018can we get more bums on seats? Can we get more people in stadiums?\u2019 That will be a massive turning point for the game.\u201d Football execs need to turn full stadiums in the Euros into sold-out WSL games this summer, she said. How exactly is unclear, but location, timing, matches, promotions, visibility and, crucially, success are key. \u201cIf you win a tournament like this the interest will be unbelievable \u2013 not just from fans wanting to come but media interest, brands that then want to come on board with the game,\u201d she said, citing Williamson on Pepsi Max billboards as an example. \u201cThat\u2019s what success does.\u201d Since the last Euros, when England lost 3-0 to the Netherlands in the semis, the women\u2019s game in England has grown massively, which Chamberlain said is demonstrated by the big-name foreign players coming to England, such as Australian national captain Sam Kerr, who plays for Chelsea, in the WSL. \u201cInstead of going to play in Germany, France, USA, they\u2019re coming to England.\u201d Big teams such as Manchester United, which brought back its women\u2019s side in 2018, and Liverpool, back in the WSL next season after being promoted, help too.  The landscape is also changing for women working across football, but they are still missing in the boardroom, says Lungi Macebo, chief operating officer of Birmingham City FC. \u201cWhat we haven\u2019t see enough of is the growth in terms of senior management and board level areas. It\u2019s been there but very very minimal,\u201d she said. She said the women\u2019s leagues are \u201ccoming on\u201d, especially across Europe, but that there\u2019s a lot to learn from US women\u2019s football, especially in terms of the ownership model and supporter engagement. Jane Purdon, director of Women in Football, said she has had numerous \u201cpinch me moments\u201d over the past 10 years but that the Euros, especially if England do well, will mark \u201canother step-change\u201d. Although a lifelong fan of the men\u2019s game \u2013 her dad used to take her to Sunderland matches as a child \u2013 Purdon believes parents \u201cfeel more comfortable to take their children to a women\u2019s football game\u201d. The tournament is proving a hit with women and children \u2013 including Princess Charlotte, 7, who instructed her father to alert the England team to her goalkeeping skills. So far, 45% of ticket buyers are female and just under a quarter are under-16s. Purdon said one venue has reported that 30% of its ticket sales are to children. At the men\u2019s Euros final last summer, she said some of her female friends had \u201chorrendous experiences because of their gender\u201d. Some, she said, had men lean into them and say: \u201cWhat are you doing here? It\u2019s a waste of a ticket.\u201d This is not something that she thinks is likely to happen at a women\u2019s match. \u201cI think England fans in the women\u2019s game look very different.\u201d However, England\u2019s women\u2019s football is by no means a model operation, specifically with racial diversity issues among spectators and players.  \u201cWe\u2019ll see what the crowds look like in this Euros and I think football needs to be really alive to this,\u201d said Purdon. \u201cAnd if it looks like it\u2019s too narrow a demographic, we need to ask ourselves why is that? And do something about it.\u201d Sue Campbell, the FA\u2019s director of women\u2019s football, said that through the Euros\u2019 legacy programme they hope to encourage more people from diverse backgrounds into the sport through half a million new playing, coaching, volunteering and refereeing opportunities across the host cities. \u201cIt\u2019s the beginning of us trying to open up the game to a much wider audience than we\u2019ve done in the past,\u201d Lady Campbell said. \u201cI hope people will see it as a really positive landmark for girls and women \u2013 not just in sport but in society as a whole.\u201d"

                    "body": "  9.34pm    Here is Andy Hunter\u2019s match report.      9.09pm    We will see no postgame comments on Fox. Pity. I\u2019d love to hear from Herdman right now.  So to recap:   Canada dominated play but misfired on too many chances Courtois made two exceptional saves Belgium scored an outstanding goal VAR had a shocking miss that could\u2019ve given Canada another early penalty Canadian universities are not colleges There is such a thing as a \u201cDrake curse\u201d  I\u2019ll be here for Canada\u2019s next game, a 4-1 victory unless that \u201cDrake curse\u201d is worse than I thought. See you then.     9.05pm    And another stat. Well, two, one involving a Canadian musician who is neither Geddy Lee nor Sarah McLachlan:       9.03pm    And the master statman adds:       9.03pm    Fox\u2019s lightning-rod commentator comments:       9.02pm    Email check before adding more postgame info:  Travis Giblin: \u201cI never thought I\u2019d see the day where a Casey Scheidigger reference was in place AND received by the readership. For those who didn\u2019t get the reference she\u2019s a skip for a successful curling team out of Alberta.\u201d I missed the opening game of this Cup because I was running a bonspiel. True story. Tim Smith: \u201cIs this stadium at altitude? I\u2019d always assumed that Qatar was flat but not sure I can recall so many wayward shots being ballooned over the goals.\u201d I think it\u2019s what is often called a rush of blood to the head. Ove Nilsson asks that I mention the player coming out in a substitution as well as the player coming on. I thought I did?     8.59pm   FULL TIME: Belgium 1-0 Canada  Let\u2019s be fair \u2013 Belgium had the three best plays in this game: a superbly taken goal on a Route One pass, Courtois\u2019 penalty save, and Courtois\u2019 save on the Larin header. And Canada\u2019s inexperience on this stage showed. Davies took a nervous penalty. A lot of shots were squandered. But then let\u2019s sum it up \u2013 Canada was by far the better team here against the obvious group favorites. And they have a solid case that they were robbed of a second penalty chance early in the game that would\u2019ve drastically changed the course of things. That bodes well for the rest of the group stage, at least. Does anyone doubt Canada can beat Croatia or Morocco?    Updated at 9.07pm GMT    8.56pm    90 +5 min: Miller is down in some discomfort.  Ball floats to Borjan all alone, and this time, he just tosses it to a teammate. And \u2026 the ref blows for full time? Not even a second of additional stoppage time?     8.55pm    90 +4 min: Belgium takes about 20 minutes to take a throw-in, which will hopefully prolong our stoppage time, if this ref is following the new directives on the matter. Ball deflects to Borjan, who punts it \u2026 to Courtois.     8.54pm    90 +3 min: Millar gets into the box and tries to cross back through a thicket of Belgium defenders. I don\u2019t see it happening at this point.     8.53pm    90 min: We\u2019ll get five minutes of stoppage time as Belgium earns a corner that will eat a bit of that. Ingo Herzke argues with the BBC: \u201cKeith Barrett wrote about that incident: \u201cwith the replay showing that he won the ball, before the Canadian attacker subsequently hit the deck.\u201d That is a VERY one-sided view, I\u2019d say; the Belgian defender just brushed the ball with his big toe before stamping Buchanan with his studs. Ridiculous. And Witsel\u2019s foul was very obvious as well. Canada wuz robbed!\u201d So there. A clever short corner from Belgium leads to a rather tame shot in the end. Borjan makes only his second save of the game, neither of them difficult. He\u2019s an outstanding keeper, as you\u2019d know if you watched CONCACAF qualifiers.     8.51pm    89 min: Attack down the left, a glimmer of space, and Belgium has to block a Canadian cross for a corner. The crowd is up \u2026 \u2026 and the kick almost lands on the opposite sideline. (Or \u201calmost goes into touch on the fly.\u201d)     8.50pm    88 min: Yet another half-chance for Canada. Michelle Peters-Jones: \u201cDon\u2019t be saying stuff about Alberta! Alphonso Davies is from Alberta! Currently the only bright light in our Alberta\u2019s lives!\u201d Hey, there\u2019s also Casey Scheiddegger, isn\u2019t there?     8.48pm    86 min: Oh, another Canadian chance! Larin has space as the cross comes in, but he mistimes his jump and sends his header high. Michael Goulborn says Bermuda would have to put up goals on a golf course. There was actually a decent player for the Baltimore Blast indoor team from Bermuda \u2013 David Bascome, maybe?     8.47pm    86 min: Now it\u2019s De Bruyne solidly in possession, but his shot is nowhere near the target.      8.46pm    83 min: Now THAT is a yellow card, as Alistair Johnston raises to catch the fresh-legged sub Openda and slides through him.  John Davis: \u201cCheers for the cracking MBM. This seems to be the definition of a \u2018played badly but ground out the three points\u2019 match from Belgium. You\u2019d praise a top four Premier League team for it. Gutted for Canada though - they\u2019ve deserved something.\u201d Hey, it\u2019s not over yet! Is it? Tim Hoult mentions the North American singular verb tense. I tend to go back and forth as I ponder whether to move to Europe. (Not too seriously. Well, maybe not.) After a delay to let Openda recover, the free kick results in a header well over the bar.  Updated at 8.56pm GMT    8.43pm    82 min: For those who track such things, Canada has outshot Belgium 20-5. They have, however, only put three on target. None better than the last one, even including the penalty.     8.43pm    80 min: WHAT A SAVE BY COURTOIS. The cross from Johnston is right on Larin\u2019s head, and the striker redirects it to the far post, only to see the outstanding Belgian keeper leap to his right and snare it with both hands.   Last roll of the dice: Osorio and Millar replace Buchanan and Eust\u00e1quio. The latter is an unfortunate loss. And now Davies has a yellow card. A bit \u2026 yeah, I\u2019m not a fan of this ref.  Updated at 8.57pm GMT    8.40pm    78 min: Batsuayi, the goal scorer who played in Lukaku\u2019s usual spot today, is departing. Openda is in. Kari Tulinius: \u201cI don\u2019t believe I\u2019ve ever seen center-back Steven de Souza Vitoria play before, but I\u2019ve already taken a liking to him. He\u2019s on the field to keep the ball far away from his goal and if that means launching the ball towards Saturn, then so be it. But he\u2019s also got proper route one passes in his locker and isn\u2019t afraid to try his luck.\u201d Andrew Benton corrects my spelling on Trossard and adds: \u201cI hope Canada are not deflating. They need as much flate as they can get in this match.\u201d I would say I\u2019m not overwhelmed by Belgium\u2019s performance here. At best, I\u2019m whelmed.     8.38pm    76 min: Ball is knocked away from Larin in the box. Buchanan appears to have taken a knock. Peter Oh writes to mention that, when it comes to Bermuda, we should watch for their passing triangles. Well played.     8.36pm    73 min: Long ball ahead to Larin, but Courtois is alert. Ken Clare: \u201cDon\u2019t you wish that Canadians would stop writing to explain Canada to you? Makes us all look like we all live in Alberta.\u201d I always enjoy seeing provincial curling championship broadcasts with so many ads for farm equipment. Sam Adekugbe comes in for Canada, replacing Laryea, and Fox\u2019s Cobi Jones (longtime US international) runs through a list of likely tactical changes that ensues.      8.33pm    71 min: I\u2019m trying to get through all the emails to distract myself from the increasing likelihood that this young, excellent Canadian squad isn\u2019t going to get the result they richly deserve. Michael Goulborn: \u201cI\u2019m not really a footie fan, but completely absorbed (from Bermuda) by your fantastic commentary. When I should be doing some work\u2026.. Keep up the good work!\u201d Bermuda, the next CONCACAF power? Keith Barrett: \u201cOn the incident in the 13th minute: the BBC coverage focused on this at half-time. The ball came off a Belgian defender and so wasn\u2019t offside. However, what followed was not a foul either: the Belgian defender made a clean tackle, with the replay showing that he won the ball, before the Canadian attacker subsequently hit the deck. So the ultimate decision (no penalty) was correct.\u201d Yeah, but the English think everything is a clean tackle. (Except for the fine folks at The Guardian.)     8.31pm    Peter Oh: \u201cThanks for the hockey reference. I would love to see a Canada shot beat Courtois five-hole.\u201d  (That\u2019s a nutmeg, in soccer terms. Through the legs.) Justin Madson: \u201cIn response to Steve\u2019s pedantry about the Jordan Rule, I also came across Jordan\u2019s Rule, which states \u201cgiven any species in any region, the nearest related species is not likely to be found in the same region nor in a remote region, but in a neighbouring district separated from the first by a barrier of some sort\u201d. I feel this gives us some insight as to why the referee seems to be different than the others calling matches so far, because he apparently is watching a different game than everyone else. On a separate note, to your credit \u201csuperstar\u201d calls in the NBA are alive and well, thanks to officiating acting as PR in that league. As everything is about PR with this World Cup, one might wonder...\u201d OK then \u2026     8.30pm    68 min: Belgium attacking now, to the point that Canada almost has a counter. You have to wonder if Canada is already starting to deflate. Brutally unlucky not to be up or at least tied at this stage.     8.29pm    67 min: A terrific chance for Belgium, but it\u2019s another heroic interception by a player who isn\u2019t identified because Fox is busy giving an update on some Harry Kane dude.   Updated at 8.35pm GMT    8.27pm    67 min: Richard hirst: \u201cLeft bank brings to mind an existentialist with a Gaulloises and a Ricard. Maybe that\u2019s Belgium\u2019s problem!\u201d Counter to Belgium, but a timely interception keeps De Bruyne from going to the races. Immediately back the other end, and Laryea sends a shot well wide.     8.26pm    65 min: Corner comes to nothing, and Dendoncker cynically grabs Buchanan to prevent a counter.     8.25pm    Peter Littley: \u201cThink the Canadian players have worked out if you fall down this referee will give the foul.\u201d That, and the Belgian subs are playing a tad negatively. Tossard, though, shows some class right away with a backheel that splits two defenders and ends up cleared for a corner.     8.24pm    63 min: Looks like the referee correctly played advantage after a badly mistimed tackle, and Canada gets a shot out of it. Unfortunately, it\u2019s to the misfiring Buchanan, whose shot will shortly land in the Persian Gulf.     8.23pm    61 min: We have to be fair here \u2013 Belgium is, obviously, full of talented players, and Eden Hazard just made a nifty move to keep an attack going on the sideline. Then Belgium promptly loses the ball, and it\u2019s all Canada again. And Hazard will come off \u2026 Leandro Tossard is in.     8.21pm    60 min: Meunier, the masked man already on a yellow, commits a needless foul. Free kick 30 yards out, and Eust\u00e1quio sends it too far to the far post.     8.21pm    On colleges and universities \u2026 JF Crepault: \u201cPlease tell Alison Curtis that her terminology comment is irrelevant as Tajon Buchanan attended *college* in the US :)\u201c Michael Platt: \u201cCan\u2019t speak for Vancouver but here at the University of Calgary, there is not a seat to be had in any of the student venues showing the game. Absolutely packed.\u201d     8.19pm    58 min: Canadian subs \u2026 Prolific scorer Cyle Larin replaces Hoilett. Isma\u00ebl Kon\u00e9, age 20, replaces Atiba Hutchinson, age 39.     8.18pm    56 min: YELLOW to Onana for reaching an arm back to swat Eust\u00e1quio in the face. So both Belgian subs already have cautions.   Updated at 8.31pm GMT    8.17pm    55 min: Pressure wins a Canadian corner, perhaps wrongly so. It comes to nothing. Padraig McAuliffe writes: \u201cSad to see Carrasco given the hook. His decade-long stint as a Belgium left-bank has been an inspiring battle against imposter syndrome that we can all take heart from.\u201d I\u2019m assuming that should be \u201cleft-back.\u201d Or not. What was his last transfer fee?     8.15pm    53 min: Yellow card to Meunier for a wayward arm to a face. It\u2019s as if the Belgian subs were sent in like ice hockey enforcers.  Yes, that\u2019s my second ice hockey reference today, but we are talking about Canada here. Now attempting to curl in the free kick, but it\u2019s through the house without any sweeping.  Updated at 8.28pm GMT    8.13pm    51 min: The Canadian press is back in full effect, and Courtois has two moments in which he needs to be very careful with his footwork as the ball is passed back to him. That brings the crowd back into it.     8.12pm    Steve Kochar writes: \u201cHey Beau, thanks for doing a great job with the MBM today! Just a note from back in minute 28... The \u201cJordan Rules\u201d was actually the name for the Detroit Pistons strategy for defending Jordan, when and where to send a double team, that sort of thing. He did get all the calls as well of course but that\u2019s just how the NBA works :) Sorry for the pedantry but that\u2019s what the MBM is for right!\u201d I think it referred to both the Pistons strategy and the NBA officiating, but I won\u2019t have a chance to look it up at this time while I\u2019m watching Canada squander more chances. 16-4 edge for Canada in attempts at goal.     8.10pm    48 min: CHANCE on a long cross from the superb Eust\u00e1quio. David puts his shot just wide.     8.10pm    47 min: The atmosphere died at the half. It\u2019s virtually silent.  Thomas Meunier has replaced Yannick Carrasco. Amadou Onana has replaced Youri Tielemans, and he immediately commits a silly foul that draws a stern lecture from our referee.      8.08pm    Emails, emails \u2026 Adam Paige: \u201cI wish more broadcasters would use the Elo rather than Fifa ranking since it\u2019s more predictive (Belgium &amp; Canada are 6th &amp; 29th in Elo but 2nd &amp; 41st in Fifa).\u201d Fair point. Michelle Peters-Jones: \u201cThe weather is lovely here, thank you. Not too cold, at least not as cold as the time the Canadian team played in the Commonwealth Stadium here and we had a lovely snow dive from Sam (Adekugbe). We also had a fun time cheering for our hometown hero, Alphonso (Davies). We even named a train station after him (not really, but one can dream). So hopefully we can beat them aging Belgians.\u201d I forgot to mention that I\u2019m actually a curler. And yet my cold tolerance is minimal, having grown up in Georgia. Julian Menz: \u201cA friend of mine is in downtown Vancouver, and reports that there was nary a fan or flag to be seen. It\u2019s early(ish) I know, but most countries would be absolutely COOKING by now! Would it help if it was the Stanley World Cup?\u201d Stephen Carr: \u201cEvening Beau. Not sure Martinez has what it takes to get a tune out of this team. He is, after all, the man who declared Tom Cleverley to be the \u2018most sensational free transfer in the history of the Premier League\u2019 when he signed him for Everton.....\u201d Martinez is a good TV commentator. Wondering if he should go back to that job. Alison Curtis: \u201cIn Canada we don\u2019t call universities \u201ccolleges\u201d. Please get your terminology right.\u201d Well, that spoils the John Belushi \u201cCOLLEGE\u201d T-shirt. Richard Hirst: \u201cWhat this game lends itself to is an analysis of the linguistic fissures within the teams. On the one hand Flemish/French/German(yes, a little known part of Belgium) and on the other English/French. Maybe at half time?\u201d Que? Matthew Carpenter-Arevalo: \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure that in the Disney retelling of Canada\u2019s world cup run, the coach, played by Robbie Williams, will say to the team in a motivational speech \u201cwe\u2019re going to play hockey, but on a pitch!\u201d\u201d I\u2019m picturing an exceptionally polite Ted Lasso. Matt Dony: \u201cIn lieu of any goals, I offer the following - Mentioning the great Sarah McLachlan, I recently discovered that Angel was written about Jonathan Melvoin, who died following an overdose while playing keyboards on tour for the Smashing Pumpkins. The quintessential funeral song, ubiquitous in emotional X-Factor auditions, was inspired, not by a close relative or dear friend, but by a news report of a relatively obscure touring musician passing away on the other side of the world. Now I\u2019m aware of this fact, I\u2019m sharing it far and wide.\u201d It\u2019s a fairly well-known story \u2013 though I say that as a McLachlan and Pumpkins fan \u2013 but worth repeating. Joseph Harvey: \u201cCollege soccer is pretty bad but it is good preparation for playing with awful referees who are apparently on hard drugs.\u201d Good point. Owen Harris uses a bad word on the 39th minute no-call. Karim Hadhoum: \u201cCanada, coming from behind is a la vogue. So take heart.\u201d What\u2019s really unfair here is knowing that Canada is absolutely capable of shifting gears. Given a 1-0 lead, Canada could\u2019ve slammed the door. And from Gorazd: \u201cI\u2019m surprised not much is being said about the situation in the 13th minute, when Canada was robbed. There was absolutely no offside, as the ball was passed back by Hazard. So the flag should never have been raised by the assistant, even worse was that the referee did not ignore it, as he saw everything play out. And then to make matters even worse, VAR did not intervene on what was a clear and obvious error by the referee and very likely a subsequent penalty for Canada. The first major refereeing error at the World Cup.\u201d Fox Sports went over it in some detail at the half, at least.  More complaining later. Game has restarted.     8.00pm    Revisiting an earlier play \u2013 Buchanan was called offside when Belgium clearly passed the ball back to Vertonghen, who then fouls Buchanan.  So Buchanan should not have been called offside. So Buchanan should\u2019ve earned a penalty. VAR apparently looked and \u2026 saw something different. That\u2019s shocking in the VAR era. Shocking.     7.54pm    Before you reach for the halftime oranges, please consider supporting Guardian journalism like this, for three reasons: \u2022 We are independent - no one tells us what we can and can\u2019t publish (and that includes Fifa) \u2022 We rely on readers funding us to keep us independent \u2022 We give you the full picture - the excitement on the pitch and the shame, corruption and injustice off it Support the Guardian from as little as \u00a31 \u2013 it only takes a minute. Thank you. I for one consider it a privilege to add my commentary (and, occasionally, an important piece of analysis on an off-field issue) to this outstanding news organization.     7.52pm   HALFTIME: Belgium 1-0 Canada  That\u2019s the most dominant half of play by a non-Mexican CONCACAF team since 2014, and they\u2019re down 1-0. Go figure. Belgium scored on its one solid chance. Canada squandered a penalty and a couple more chances, and give the old-timers in Belgium\u2019s defense some credit for scrambling to block a bunch of shots.     7.51pm    45 +4 min: A Canadian corner kick is deflected out to Eust\u00e1quio at the top of the box, and I pity whoever blocked that screamer. Looks like Tielemans. It hit his arms, but he had them tucked in front of his chest to prevent being leveled. Can\u2019t blame him there. That\u2019s Belgium\u2019s sixth blocked shot.     7.48pm    45 +2 min: CHANCE and it was easier for Buchanan to score than to NOT score, but he did the latter. Perfect ball in from Laryea. Buchanan pressured but with a chance to strike from six yards out, and he skies it over the ball. Er \u2026 bar.  Updated at 7.49pm GMT    7.47pm    45 +1 min: As predicted, five minutes of stoppage time.     7.46pm   GOAL! Belgium 1-0 Canada (Batshuayi 44)  \u201cAgainst the run of play\u201d is hardly sufficient. A direct ball, maybe 60 yards in the air straight up the field from Toby Alderweireld, lands at the feet of Michy Batshuayi, whose first touch is a fine finish.      Updated at 7.57pm GMT    7.43pm    42 min: Belgium lofts a ball far ahead \u2026 for no one. They\u2019ve been forced to play dump-and-chase like an aging and unskilled ice hockey team. But you just sense that if they can hold on another few minutes, they can regroup and turn it around. Given the stoppage time we\u2019ve seen at this Cup, I\u2019d expect no less than five minutes for the VAR checks.     7.41pm    40 min: Hutchinson and Hazard get tangled. That\u2019s a combined 70 years on this planet right there. Foul goes against Hutchinson, rightly so.     7.41pm    39 min: Mark Clattenburg, Fox\u2019s rules analyst, says the defender slowed down just enough to avoid being called here. And the VAR crew agrees. Ah well.     7.39pm    38 min: How is that not a penalty? Witsel bundles over Laryea from behind. He could call the push or the trip. He calls neither. Again, I\u2019m loathe to criticize referees, but this is a shambles. Hold up .. VAR is looking!   Updated at 7.48pm GMT    7.37pm    36 min: Canada slows it down for a bit. Davies then slips through the middle, but the possession goes nowhere.     7.36pm    35 min: Are we in Toronto?       7.33pm    32 min: Hoilett easily and cleanly wins a battle with Hazard, then pops the ball into the box for David, whose header doesn\u2019t quite trouble anyone.     7.32pm    31 min: Oh, but the youth shows sometimes! Eust\u00e1quio creates a chance for David, who easily could\u2019ve sent it to a teammate rushing down the right, but he shoots instead. Canada has outshot Belgium 11-2.  11-2!     7.31pm    30 min: Johnston gets into the box with the ball. He falls. No call, probably reasonably so. But the ball comes back to him, and his shot stings Courtois\u2019 gloves. Canada truly deserve a goal here. They\u2019ve taken it to an accomplished team.     7.29pm    28 min: Witsel initiates contact. He falls. He draws the foul. Remember the old NBA \u201cJordan Rules,\u201d in which Michael Jordan got all the calls? Yeah.     7.28pm    27 min: Davies holds well against several defenders. He lays it over for Hutchinson, who rushes his shot and places it well wide.     7.26pm    25 min: De Bruyne leads the break down the middle this time. Laryea makes slight contact with Hazard, who appears to consider the option of falling but decides against it. Good for him. But then he drops on minor contact from Johnston. I\u2019m a referee, so I don\u2019t criticize referees, but come on, man.     7.25pm    23 min: The other bad news: Presses can be beaten. A direct ball goes to Hazard, who makes a nifty turn that leaves Johnston in the dust. Miller makes a vital block to concede a corner that comes to nothing \u2026 besides a counterattack that makes Courtois race out of the box to cover.   Updated at 7.32pm GMT    7.23pm    22 min: The Canadian press (on the field, not in the pressbox, where the Canadian Press does a fine job) is a sight to behold. The bad news is that the referee is now calling fouls for breathing on Belgian players.     7.21pm    20 min: Buchanan is becoming a liability because of his propensity for fouling. Maybe a drawback of having played rough-and-tumble college soccer?     7.20pm    19 min: Belgium breaks the press! Here comes De Bruyne! Tielemans is wide open to his right! And De Bruyne meekly dribbles into the Canadian forest.   Updated at 7.30pm GMT    7.19pm    18 min: Belgium finally gets a minute of possession. It\u2019s in their own half, but at least it\u2019s a period of breaking the pressure. For now \u2013 the press forces a ball all the way back to Courtois.     7.17pm    16 min: Roberto Martinez needs to change something, fast. As (ahem) predicted here, the \u201cveteran\u201d Belgian defenders are having a lot of trouble fending off the Canadian speedsters.     7.15pm    15 min: \u201cAttempts at goal\u201d: Belgium 1 (first minute, harmless), Canada 7.  Costa Rica had zero.     7.14pm    13 min: Cross! Not cleared! Shot blocked! Another shot! Offside call!  This is all happening in the Belgian box. Belgium dominated play for \u2026 the first possession of the game. It has been all Canada since then.     7.13pm    The call, on the other hand, wasn\u2019t controversial \u2026      7.12pm   PENALTY SAVED!  Canada might have an argument with the referee here. That took forever to set up, and Davies had far too long to think about it. Courtois saves it rather easily. The rebound goes back to Davies but at an awkward angle.    Updated at 7.50pm GMT    7.10pm   PENALTY TO CANADA!  That review didn\u2019t take long, and manager Roberto Martinez looks like he\u2019s about to swallow his own face. Yellow to Carrasco as well.     7.09pm    VAR shows Carrasco had his arm out, and the shot hit his arm. Oh dear \u2026   Updated at 7.13pm GMT    7.09pm    8 min: The corner lands to Buchanan, whose side half-volley deflects upward and is snared by Courtois.  Is there a handball? The ref is looking!     7.08pm    7 min: It\u2019s a promising Canadian cross from Buchanan that earns a corner kick.  Canada has completed 45 of the first 69 passes of this game, the stats say.     7.06pm    5 min: So to sum up so far \u2013 one shot each way (Canada\u2019s shot was blocked). And one impetuous foul by Tajon Buchanan. Ah, youth.      7.03pm    2 min: Canada bounces back with a good spell of possession in the attacking third. This is a frenetic start.      7.02pm    1 min: Turnover, Belgian shot from long-range, easily saved.     7.02pm   Kickoff  Referee Janny Sikazwe of Zambia blows the whistle. He has plenty of experience but is also known for blowing the whistle too early in an international game. \u201c\u201cI think God told me to end the match,\u201d he said. (Thanks, CTV, for noting this.)   Updated at 7.09pm GMT    7.00pm    OK, one more \u2026 Richard Hirst writes: \u201cOn the assumption you are Canadian, good luck, I\u2019m rooting for you. After all, (most of) The Band, Joni Mitchell, Neil Young and Paul Peschisolido (yes, I\u2019m a Fulham supporter) - not a bad line up.\u201d I\u2019m not Canadian. At least, not yet. But I\u2019m a huge Rush fan. And I love Kids in the Hall. And health care. And Sarah McLachlan. And I had a great time covering the Olympics in Whistler \u2026 OK, that\u2019s it, I\u2019m moving.  Wait \u2026 it\u2019s cold?      6.58pm    Final preliminaries \u2026 Peter Oh says this game is a perfect \u201cbrunch menu\u201d: \u201cI don\u2019t have a horse in this race but I like Belgian waffles and maple syrup. Hot coffee is brewing and the sun is out on a crisp, cold morning in Northern California. Life could be worse!\u201d Ted Storer on CONCACAF: \u201cYou know this better than most. CONCACAF always seems to have a team at the World Cup Finals who are just happy to have qualified (El Salvador \u2013 1982, Jamaica -1998, Honduras \u2013 every time, Trinidad and Tobago - 2002, Panama - 2018, etc). I am really hoping that Costa Rica is that team for 2022 \u2013 having finished fourth in the regional qualifications and defeating New Zealand on a single goal in the Confederation Play-ins. Really, really, really hoping it is not the US \u2013 or Mexico \u2013 or Canada.\u201d And one for the stat files: Atiba Hutchinson is rather old.  The Canadian anthem was greeted with much enthusiasm. Clearly a lot of Canadian fans there. And the players, along with Herdman, sang loudly. Not on key by any stretch of the imagination, but they gave it a try.     6.53pm   Belgian lineup  This team is apparently pretty good, even without Lukaku. The Red Devils also have three players who are definitely at the back \u2013 Jan Vertonghen, Toby Alderweireld and Leander Dendoncker \u2013 while others are kinda sorta defenders. Kevin De Bruyne and Eden Hazard, generational talents in almost any country, are in the attack with Fenerbahce\u2019s Michy Batshuayi. One note: These guys aren\u2019t young. Players over 30: Courtois (30), Vertonghen (35), Alderweireld (33), Witsel (31), Hazard (31), De Bruyne (31). Good luck dealing with 22-year-olds Davies and David.      6.46pm   Canadian lineup  Miller, Vit\u00f3ria and Johnston are the back line in what you could call a 3-4-3 or 5-2-3 or 5-4-3-2-1 or whatever.  Davies plays farther back on the field for Bayern but plays in the attack for Canada along with David and Hoilett. Hutchinson, the 39-year-old captain, anchors the midfield with Eust\u00e1quio. Cyle Larin, who led CONCACAF qualifying with six goals, is on the bench.       6.40pm    The Canadian conductor \u2026 John Herdman\u2019s teams routinely beat the odds. He led New Zealand\u2019s women to their first World Cup points. (Name-dropping: I was there. I used to do interesting things.) He led Canada\u2019s women to two Olympic bronze medals, one of which could easily have been silver or gold. He led Canada\u2019s men to a resounding march through CONCACAF qualifying. In this case, he\u2019s helped a bit by an upswing in Canadian talent, prodded a bit by people who are starting to take soccer development seriously and intelligently. The Long Term Player Development model stresses development over winning, including a mildly controversial principle of not keeping league standings for players under 12.      6.35pm    Are the Canadians more \u201cAmerican\u201d than the USA? This roster looks like a US roster of the 1990s and 2000s \u2026  Players who played in college (Kamal Miller, Alistair Johnston, Tajon Buchanan, Cyle Larin, Richie Laryea \u2026 plus a couple who played in Canadian colleges) Players who spent most of their childhoods elsewhere but were eligible for Canada (Stephen Eust\u00e1quio, Steven Vit\u00f3ria) Players who came to Canada as refugees (Alphonso Davies, Milan Borjan)  Then add several players who came up through MLS academies, including the prodigy Davies, who moved from Vancouver to Bayern Munich in 2018.      6.23pm    Canada\u2019s record: Poor They\u2019ve only qualified once before, losing all three games in 1986. In CONCACAF qualifying, they\u2019re typically thrashed by Central American opponents, rarely even making it to the final round. This time around?  They won the final round. And that\u2019s after losing two of their last three, having taken their feet off the gas pedals after a torrid run in which they drew away to the mighty Mexico and USA and beat those teams, along with almost everyone else, on home tundra.      6.17pm    Canada 2, Japan 1 Did that get your attention? Hope so.  That was the result last week when Canada faced Japan last week without two of its best players, Alphonso Davies and Stephen Eust\u00e1quio. Yes, that\u2019s the same Japanese team that beat Germany 2-1 today. It\u2019s not a fluke. Time to explain why \u2026      6.10pm   Preamble  The USA drew Wales 1-1 and has shaky chances to advance. Mexico needed a penalty save to hold Poland to a draw in a group torn asunder by Saudi Arabia\u2019s win over Argentina. Costa Rica just gave up five goals to Spain. No, wait, six. Oops, seven. Is it over? Finally? OK, moving on. So the hopes of North America rest with \u2026 Canada? Against Belgium? Indeed they do. And a result here would not be the biggest shock of the Cup. And a Canadian presence in the round of 16 is certainly a strong possibility, especially after seeing Croatia and Morocco launch damp squibs in a scoreless draw today.  This could be fun. Follow along with me, won\u2019t you?  "

                    "body": "Kevin De Bruyne believes Erling Haaland is so obsessed with scoring that the Manchester City striker can register 800 goals in his career. The Norwegian\u2019s opener in Thursday\u2019s 3-2 Carabao Cup win over Liverpool was his 24th strike in 19 appearances in all competitions this season. His total career tally is approaching 200.  De Bruyne said: \u201cErling is so obsessed with goals. He already has about 200 goals, so he can probably go to 600, 700 or 800 if he stays fit and does the things that he does. Erling is a top-level striker. I don\u2019t see Erling as different to a lot of people. He is a normal football player like everybody else and he doesn\u2019t take himself too seriously. \u201cWhen you talk about professional footballers or professional athletes, everybody has that little edge. I don\u2019t think you can become a professional player if you don\u2019t have that little something to become the best version you can be.  \u201cHe is still a young boy enjoying his life and he takes his football very seriously. He loves scoring goals, so I think that is the most unique thing he has.\u201d De Bruyne is highly admired by Pep Guardiola, the manager describing him as one of the greatest ever City players after the Liverpool victory. The Belgian offered a similar sentiment, stating that his manager is a genius.  \u201cI have been with him for so long, so I can understand when he changes things [in a game],\u201d the midfielder said. \u201cIt is just the way that he sees football, his football philosophy, which is to get the ball as much as possible and play good football with it. He wants to achieve that as much as possible in the game. He will be a genius in one sort of way because otherwise he wouldn\u2019t have changed football as much as he did. The way that he plays football, a lot of people do it now because of him and the Barcelona way, [Johan] Cruyff etc. It is like a chain. \u201cHe evolved it in a way that is important in football and a lot of teams are now pressing from the front, playing from the back, playing good football. He changed it in a lot of senses.\u201d De Bruyne also described Phil Foden as having a high potential. \u201cHe is probably one of the biggest talents that I have played with and his ceiling can be so high. He has already won four Premier Leagues and he is 22,\u201d De Bruyne said. \u201cHe is very smart as a player. Where there are a lot of tactics, you still have that guy who has that little bit of magic and he is one of these guys who has that magic so he can just do a lot of different stuff. [He can achieve] whatever he wants.\u201d"

                    "body": "Last week, there was a leak. More accurately, a leaked rumour. It probably didn\u2019t register with just about any person who does not play video games, but it was notable nonetheless. FIFA 23, the latest instalment of the hugely popular series, will feature the 2023 Women\u2019s World Cup. It will also make women\u2019s football more prominent than it has been since manufacturer EA Sports introduced female players to the long-running simulation game in 2015. Back then, there were only 12 women\u2019s teams, all of which were international, with no domestic leagues. FIFA 23, however, will reportedly allow players to select women\u2019s club sides for the very first time, including from the FA Women\u2019s Super League, Frauen-Bundesliga, National Women\u2019s Soccer League and Division 1 F\u00e9minine. A video game, of course, is just that \u2013 a fantasy. But it is also a fantasy with more than nine million active players across all platforms. And with the 2023 World Cup now 500 days away, there is genuine value in marketing the women\u2019s game to the global masses.  In little more than 16 months the world\u2019s eyes will fall on Australia and New Zealand, the two hosts of the first tournament to be staged in the southern hemisphere. On Monday morning there were more eyes on a car crash on the Sydney Harbour Bridge than down below in front of the Opera House, where Matildas players and football officials made a press appearance to mark the first of what will undoubtedly be a few milestone events. Though it flew under the radar, it was also important, and appears \u2013 at least on the surface \u2013 to demonstrate a commitment to ensuring this opportunity will not be viewed as one that got away once the bright lights of the tournament have faded. The word \u201clegacy\u201d has a prominent part of the countdown vernacular. Football Australia\u2019s official branding is called Legacy \u201923, a five-pillared \u201cambitious plan to ensure we deliver positive and enduring benefits for Australia\u2019s largest community sport, beyond 2023\u201d. \u201cWe know that this tournament will take women\u2019s football to another level, and we are committed to leveraging it to escalate the growth of women\u2019s football in Australia,\u201d said FA\u2019s head of women\u2019s football, Women\u2019s World Cup legacy and inclusion, Sarah Walsh. \u201cThrough Legacy \u201823 we will deliver meaningful change including 50/50 gender participation, greater female representation in leadership roles and greater access and pathways at all levels of the game.\u201d Indeed, for the first time in World Cup history, the First Nations names for the nine host cities have been weaved into the branding as part of a promise to make real, tangible improvements in the inclusion of Indigenous communities in both countries. The five Australian cities are referred to not just as Adelaide, Brisbane, Melbourne, Perth and Sydney, but also Tarntanya, Meaanjin, Naarm, Boorloo and Gadigal. The New Zealand cities are T\u0101maki Makaurau/Auckland, \u014ctepoti/Dunedin, Kirikiriro/Hamilton, and Te Whanganui-a-Tara/Wellington. Both on the pitch and off, the gestures are laudable, and the federal and state governments says they are on board. But cold hard cash is what makes the world turn and football in this part of it is notorious for having none. Last year, FA chief executive James Johnson lobbied for $275m in government funding over an eight-year period to achieve its ambitious Legacy \u201923 proposal, including $180m earmarked for a \u201cfemale community football facility legacy fund\u201d to reverse a long-standing paucity of infrastructure. He was told he would get only part of that sum. The government has offered some cash, including $12m to support high-performance objectives for the Matildas, Young Matildas and Junior Matildas such as international fixtures. It came after the Women\u2019s Performance Gap Report painted a bleak outlook for the depth of Australia\u2019s national team, a predicament highlighted by the Matildas\u2019 quarter-final exit at January\u2019s Asian Cup. And that is the elephant in the room: that Australia are expected to have eyes on the trophy but could not break the back of a confederation with no teams inside the world\u2019s top nine. It has put coach Tony Gustavsson under significant pressure, though captain Sam Kerr says that is mainly external. \u201cI think we\u2019ve always had this happen to us as a team, where maybe before the World Cup we haven\u2019t been performing or things have happened where they fired our coach, or got a changeover of coach right before the Olympics or the World Cup,\u201d Kerr told Fox Sports on Monday. \u201cFor us that would be the worst thing in the world because starting fresh again, it\u2019s just we\u2019ve done it three or four times now. It happened when we lost Hesterine [de Reus in 2014], when we lost Staj [Alen Stajcic in 2019], when we lost Ante [Milicic in 2020]. It\u2019s always a year out from a major tournament.\u201d Internationally speaking, revenue will not rely solely on the host nations\u2019 performances, and the presence of reigning world champions the United States along with Europe\u2019s heavy hitters should bring a significant economic boost, especially as the world continues to reopen from Covid-19 restrictions. Add to that the presence of new countries in the expanded, 32-team competition, including Vietnam and Stajcic\u2019s Philippines, with whom he has just signed a contract extension to guide the team through the tournament. \u201cSeven teams are now confirmed \u2013 two for the first time,\u201d said Jane Fernandez, Australia\u2019s chief operating officer for the tournament. \u201cQualification will continue to gather momentum over the next 12 months with 25 nations set to secure qualification and join us in Australia and New Zealand 500 days from now for the biggest FIFA Women\u2019s World Cup in history.\u201d"

As reported in the Guardian on Friday, the competition will have an almost tenfold rise on the \u00a3428,915 fund available to the 417 teams competing this season.  \u201cA disproportionate amount of this new fund will be invested into the early rounds of the competition,\u201d the Football Association said. \u201cThis will ensure those clubs further down the pyramid really feel the benefit.\u201d The FA Board signed off on the increase last Thursday and it will now begin discussions on how the money is allocated.

Clapton Community FC launched a crowdfunding campaign to cover their away trips on a run to the third round this season, while Lewes FC wrote to the FA in February 2019 demanding action. Last season, Chelsea collected \u00a325,000 for their win over Arsenal in December\u2019s delayed final, 1.4% of the \u00a31.8m handed to the men\u2019s winners, Leicester.

                    "body": "The only threat to Ukraine\u2019s bid to keep their World Cup campaign alive came from a level of physical and mental fatigue that was wholly understandable. When Artem Dovbyk strode forward to score in the fifth minute of stoppage time, it was clear even tiredness could not halt the Ukrainian dream.\nThere will be inevitable focus on the paucity of Scotland\u2019s showing here but Ukraine were exceptional. After Andriy Yarmolenko and Roman Yaremchuk handed the visitors a deserved two-goal lead, unlikely home hope arose from a goalkeeping blunder.\nIn plain football terms, let alone taking into account the circumstances Ukraine\u2019s players encountered before this match, late Scotland salvation would have been totally unfair. Cheers reverberated from Glasgow to Kyiv \u2013 including in many towns and cities in between \u2013 after it did not arrive. The scale of emotion as Ukraine celebrated their win was appropriate. The stars wore yellow.\n\n\u201cFocus on football\u201d had been the recurring pre-match message from within the Scotland camp. That essentially happened straight from kick-off, with every crunching tackle by those in navy met with roars of approval from the majority of the crowd. Earlier, when draped in the flags of their country, Ukraine players had clapped those supporters for their widespread applause of their national anthem.\nThe approach of everyone associated with the Scotland team to Ukraine has been on point from the moment it was clear this semi-final, initially scheduled for March, would at the very least be delayed. Ukraine had no desire to be patronised here; they duly were not.\nSteve Clarke\u2019s insistence that the scale of this football challenge had to be respected partly resonated in the knowledge that Ukraine have fine players. Within 17 minutes, the visitors had twice been denied by a superb Craig Gordon.\n\nScotland\u2019s goalkeeper saved acrobatically from Viktor Tsygankov. His next stop, when Yarmolenko looked certain to score from close range , was even better. As Gordon leapt upon the loose ball, the Ukraine coach, Oleksandr Petrakov, did nothing to mask his frustration. At age 39, Gordon remains in the form of his life.\nScotland spent those early exchanges struggling to gain a foothold in the game. Clarke had gambled with the deployment of two strikers, Ch\u00e9 Adams and Lyndon Dykes, but looked on as the opposition midfield imposed themselves on proceedings. Ukraine were the slicker, sharper, more coherent team during the opening half. And by a considerable distance.\nWhen the goal that Ukraine completely deserved arrived it was blissfully simple. A chipped pass from the deep-lying Ruslan Malinovskyi should have been swept up by the Scottish central defence. Instead, Yarmolenko was allowed to reach it first. The West Ham player showed composure to loft the ball over the onrushing Gordon. Home appeals for offside proved in vain. The sense of Scotland stage fright was both impossible to ignore and ominously similar to what transpired throughout games at this venue during last summer\u2019s Euros.\n\nClarke used the break to make the perfectly logical move to replace the ineffectual Dykes with Ryan Christie. In doing so, the manager wanted to amend a back-to-front approach that had failed to work. The problem was, Ukraine doubled their lead before Scotland had a chance to implement their new plan.\nGenerous defending was again a factor. Oleksandr Karavaev was given time and space to float a cross to the back post, where Yaremchuk was the gleeful benefactor. Neither Aaron Hickey nor Scott McTominay could beat the striker in the air. Yaremchuk nodded past the helpless Gordon from all of six yards.\n\nWhile Ukraine celebrated wildly, Scotland were hit with the stark realisation of being in deep trouble. The hosts\u2019 challenge would have been insurmountable but for a smart Gordon block from Yarmolenko.\nThe Ukraine goalkeeper, Heorhiy Bushchan, perhaps through boredom, cracked a clearance against the onrushing Callum McGregor. In summing up all that had gone before, the ball flew wide of the goal.\nJohn McGinn then passed up the kind of opportunity Scotland had desperately wanted. After Bushchan flapped at a cross, the Aston Villa midfielder had a glorious chance to head into the net from close range. Instead, McGinn inexplicably sent his attempt wide. It was no wonder he slumped to his knees.\n\nThat the erratic Bushchan played his part in a Scotland goal was little surprise. McGregor was really only trying to keep an attack alive with a lofted ball that the goalkeeper allowed to squirm through his hands. The assistant referee rightly adjudged the ball had bounced over the line before a despairing Ukraine clearance.\nScotland, who had been generally desperate until this 79th-minute juncture, had a pulse. The final act, though, belonged to Dovbyk as he marauded on to Oleksandr Zinchenko\u2019s through pass. Only the bold can assert that Wales will deny Ukraine their spot in Qatar."

                    "body": "Good morning. Transport secretary Mark Harper went to Manchester yesterday to discuss the crisis in train cancellations across the north. Jamie Driscoll, the North of Tyne mayor, attended by Zoom: the train service was too unreliable for him to make the journey. West Yorkshire mayor Tracy Brabin\u2019s train was cancelled, but she made it in the end. Her train home had only half the carriages it was meant to. There\u2019s a pattern here: it\u2019s only a month since Greater Manchester mayor Andy Burnham and Liverpool City Region metro mayor Steve Rotheram were late for a press conference on the same subject because their trains were cancelled. People who live outside the region might have their suspicions about whether these incidents were engineered for maximum political impact: surely trains can\u2019t go wrong this frequently, they might ask. \u201cLol,\u201d say the residents of the north of England, as they wearily refresh the National Rail Enquiries app yet again. There are problems with rail services all over the UK, but the issues across the rest of the country pale in comparison to those in the north. For today\u2019s newsletter, I\u2019ve spoken to Helen Pidd, the Guardian\u2019s north of England editor, about what\u2019s gone wrong, how seriously it\u2019s affecting people\u2019s lives and what can be done to fix it. Here are the headlines. Five big stories  Water | More than 70% of the English water industry is owned by foreign investment vehicles, the super-rich, businesses lodged in tax havens and pension funds, Guardian researcg has found. The disclosure comes amid calls for the industry to be held to account for sewage dumping, leaks and water shortages. Monarchy | A royal aide has resigned and apologised after a black guest, Ngozi Fulani, the founder of the charity Sistah Space, was left feeling \u201ctraumatised\u201d after repeated questioning about her heritage despite having said she was a British national at a reception hosted by the queen consort. China | One of China\u2019s most senior pandemic response officials has said the country is entering a \u201cnew stage and mission\u201d in the latest indication of the government\u2019s changing stance after mass protests against its zero-Covid policy. Vice-premier Sun Chunlan said China was taking a more \u201chumane approach\u201d. Prisons | Dominic Raab has been accused of presiding over a \u201cfoolish and unrealistic\u201d prisons policy after the justice department was forced to request the emergency use of 400 police cells for inmates for the first time in 14 years. Christine McVie | Fleetwood Mac singer-songwriter Christine McVie has died at the age of 79. Bandmate Mick Fleetwood said part of his heart had \u201cflown away today.\u201d  In depth: \u2018It\u2019s like a cloud that\u2019s permanently over everyone\u2019s heads\u2019  When I reach Helen, she is sitting on a train from Manchester to Preston. It\u2019s stationary, but you guessed that already. \u201cI need to get to court for a trial I\u2019m covering for 10am, or 10.30 latest,\u201d she said. \u201cLast night I waited to see the cancellations that would be announced, and there were 60 across TransPennine Express, including quite a few on the line I needed to take. That\u2019s probably going to be a problem, but delays on Northern, the other operator on the line, weren\u2019t as easy to see. So I got up early to leave myself time.\u201d Here\u2019s what Helen found \u2013 note the bright red exclamation marks:  This will be a familiar story to anybody living in the north of England, which has endured dismal transport infrastructure for years \u2013 yet even by that standard, the recent problems on the network look like a genuine crisis. *** How bad is the problem? Pretty bad! Across the UK, services are at a low ebb: train cancellations are at their highest level since records began in 2015, with about one in 26, or just under 4%, being cancelled across the country. But operators in the North are doing significantly worse. While TransPennine Express (TPE) will report cancellation rates of between 5.6% and 11.8% for the weeks between 23 October and 20 November, that figure takes advantage of a significant loophole which means that cancellations confirmed before 10pm the previous night don\u2019t get included: add in those trains, and the figure balloons to 20-30%. (Read more about that in this story of Helen\u2019s published earlier this week.) The 60 trains TPE cancelled on Wednesday by that method is not unusual: Transport for Greater Manchester estimates that 50-80 a day are being pulled the night before. (They are not included in Delay Repay compensation.) Meanwhile, Avanti trains between London and Manchester have been reduced from three to one an hour. In a survey published by watchdog Transport Focus yesterday, 28% of Avanti passengers said that their last journey was delayed, changed, or cancelled, as did 22% of TPE customers. Look at the forest of hands that shoot up when guests at the People\u2019s Powerhouse conference are asked by Tracy Brabin who has recently had a train cancelled. Unsurprisingly, all those missing trains mean that the ones that are still running are severely overcrowded: see this grim account of problems on Avanti trains for more. \u201cIt\u2019s coming up to my 10th anniversary of howling about trains,\u201d said Helen, who started reporting from the region in 2013. \u201cIt\u2019s been bad throughout that time, but recently it seems to be getting worse.\u201d And all of this is estimated by Transport North East to be costing the northern economy around \u00a3400m a year. *** Why is it so bad? The most pressing problem affecting the region\u2019s trains is a shortage of people to drive them. \u201cThe business model relies on drivers being willing to do extra shifts on their rest days and to do overtime,\u201d Helen said. \u201cBut because of bad industrial relations and rail strikes recently, they\u2019ve unilaterally stopped.\u201d There are high levels of sickness, too, which rail expert Christian Wolmar told the BBC was \u201creally an expression of employee dissatisfaction\u201d. Staff haven\u2019t had a pay rise in more than two years. The government has sought to blame unions for this \u2013 although RMT leader Mick Lynch says that Mark Harper has stepped away from his predecessor Grant Shapps\u2019 \u201cbellicose nonsense\u201d. But, Helen points out, \u201crelying on people to work so many more hours than they are supposed to is an unsustainable system\u201d.  Underpinning that short-term personnel crisis are deeper-rooted problems which are the product, critics say, of years of under-investment. Last year\u2019s integrated rail plan reduced capital investment by \u00a336bn across the UK, with most of that shortfall hitting the north, the Northern Powerhouse Partnership says. Jamie Driscoll, the North of Tyne mayor who Zoomed in to the meeting with Harper yesterday, told the Today Programme: \u201cThe infrastructure is Victorian, the signalling is the old-fashioned semaphore you\u2019ll see from black and white movies \u2026 You can only get six trains in and out of Newcastle an hour heading south to the rest of the country.\u201d Similarly, the line running from Liverpool to Hull is not electrified. \u201cFind me a corridor like that anywhere in Europe,\u201d Juergen Maier, vice-chair of the Northern Powerhouse Partnership, told Newsnight. *** How does all that impact people\u2019s lives? It has a profound effect, Helen says, as her train starts to crawl forwards again. \u201cIt deeply affects people\u2019s lives, and life chances.\u201d Take the seaside town of Cleethorpes, where many residents badly need an efficient rail service to get to better-paying jobs in Manchester: 77 trains on that line were cancelled in the week to 25 November. \u201cIf you want a better-paid job or the chance to go to college somewhere else, you just can\u2019t rely on it.\u201d  The choice becomes to give up on your ambitions, move away (and deal another small blow to your home town\u2019s economy), or use a car \u2013 which, Helen noted recently, is a significant factor in driving emissions. Meanwhile, even life\u2019s pleasures become an endurance test. \u201cDo I risk going to a gig, or a theatre, or a football match if I might have to get a taxi home? What about childcare? It\u2019s like a cloud that\u2019s permanently over everyone\u2019s heads.\u201d Would the situation be allowed to persist if the same thing was happening in London or the south east? \u201cNot a chance in hell.\u201d *** How can the problems be fixed? The government has sought to link a deal on pay that would put an end to strike action \u2013 and likely mean the return of rest-day work and overtime \u2013 to accepting a new seven-day rota.  The region\u2019s mayors have run out of patience with that approach, and while they described their meeting with Harper as \u201cpositive\u201d, they added that \u201cthe time for warm words is over\u201d and said that the government must not \u201creward these appalling levels of service by signing-off on contract extensions when they come up for renewal.\u201d Harper, for his part, said that he would not block a rest day working agreement but said it was an \u201cinterim step\u201d. Meanwhile, almost 100 new drivers are meant to be in place for Avanti by the time of a timetable change due on 11 December \u2013 when more trains are supposed to be added to the schedule. But, says Helen, there is little obvious reason to hope for proper investment. \u201cThe most immediate problem for the government is whether it should allow these operators\u2019 contracts to continue,\u201d she said. \u201cBut the big structural issues are not going away.\u201d Then she goes into a tunnel. She eventually gets to court 40 minutes late. What else we\u2019ve been reading   Twitter\u2019s future remains uncertain after Elon Musk told staff that bankruptcy was not out of the question.

Nimo  World Cup A tense final round in Group C finished with Argentina defeating Poland 2-0 despite a missed penalty from Lionel Messi and Mexico beating Saudi Arabia 2-1. The results were enough to put Argentina and Poland through. Poland made it by the narrowest of margins, only ahead of Mexico on yellow card count until Salem al-Dawsari scored for Saudi Arabia in the 95th minute \u2013 but even then one more goal for Mexico would have been enough to take them through. Earlier, France topped Group D despite losing 1-0 to Tunisia, while Australia made it to the round of 16 for the first time in 16 years with a famous 1-0 victory over Denmark, who finished bottom.

                    "body": "The triumphant announcement of a mixed-teams event across Australia to launch the next summer of tennis stems from a crisis of conscience three years ago. Billed as a world first \u201cshowcasing equality at the highest level of the sport\u201d, the United Cup will feature the world\u2019s best men and women and is a positive step forward for tennis. Three years in the making, the 18-team, $23m event promises to be a celebration of tennis at its best to whet the appetite leading into the Australian Open at Melbourne Park. Bar for the onset of Covid-19, it is a competition that would have started a year ago at the latest, and with good reason given the controversy that unfolded in Brisbane in January, 2020.  For an organisation that champions its commitment to equality, a point emphasised in the press release announcing the United Cup, Tennis Australia was on the defensive that summer as it attempted to fend off accusations of sexism. The introduction of the lucrative ATP Cup, an event similar to the Davis Cup, resulted in a farce that sparked a seething reaction from some of the biggest stars in women\u2019s tennis. As per a contractual agreement, the men\u2019s team event had to be played on the main stadium courts in Brisbane, Sydney and Perth, where it started on the back foot after being introduced at the cost of the long-running and popular Hopman Cup. This meant that in Brisbane, which had drawn an extremely strong WTA field, women were given the cold shoulder and sent to the back blocks for a \u201csecond-hand\u201d event. Just shy of 50 years after Billie Jean King and the Original Nine boldly took on the establishment when launching a women\u2019s professional tour, the disparity in treatment and the gulf in prize money on offer between the sexes was galling.  Ash Barty had returned to Australia a grand slam champion and the world\u2019s top-ranked woman. But what should have been a triumphant homecoming party in Brisbane unfolded in a doubles match on an outside court with makeshift stands instead of Pat Rafter Arena.  Grand slam champions Maria Sharapova, Sloane Stephens and Sam Stosur were all forced outside as well, but not world No 486 Michail Pervolarakis, who enjoyed rare stadium time. Sharapova, a five-time major champion returning from injury, described it as a \u201cstrange strategic move\u201d and said \u201cthere\u2019s a lot of girls that are deserving of that centre-court spot\u201d.  The Gold Coast-raised Stosur said the treatment was a \u201cbit rough\u201d and \u201cnot great\u201d and confusing for fans. Stephens was especially scathing when saying it was disappointing the women \u201cwere not even in the conversation to begin with\u201d. \u201cIt was what the ATP wanted,\u201d she said. \u201cThey got what they wanted. [The] girls to the side. That\u2019s kind of how it always is.\u201d In a sport where unforced and forced errors can decide the outcome of a match, this was an example of the latter, with Tennis Australia backed into a corner. With men agitating for more money, and the ATP Cup arrived at by tour officials as the vehicle to raise finances, the event was being shopped to other international markets. Sacrifices, which included the Hopman Cup, were made by Tennis Australia to protect their calendar turf and ensure that the world\u2019s best men did not start their summers elsewhere.  Of itself, the ATP Cup enjoyed some fine moments. The atmosphere inside Pat Rafter Arena as Alex de Minaur took it to Alexander Zverev, with Nick Kyrgios taunting the German from the sidelines, was electric. The finals in Sydney produced some brilliant tennis. Hopman Cup co-founder Paul McNamee credits the ATP Cup with reinvigorating doubles.   But the potential for lasting reputational damage to Tennis Australia and the sport was clear and prompted TA chief executive Craig Tiley to describe it as a \u201ctransitional year\u201d. Barty was still to play her singles \u2013 organisers waited until the ATP Cup left town to schedule her on Pat Rafter Arena \u2013 when Tiley confirmed changes would occur. This included the prospect of a second stadium court in Brisbane. With the Olympics on the horizon in 2032, that may happen.  After years of negotiations, which included some fine-tuning over the past month to ensure all parties are happy, the exclusion of Russian and Belarusian players aside, the United Cup is now alive, with lessons hopefully learnt from the tumult of Brisbane .

A City supporter was arrested and ejected from the Etihad after abusing disabled Liverpool fans on the disabled tribune. A 15-year-old girl required medical treatment after being injured by one of several objects thrown into the home crowd from the visiting section.\nIf identified, the culprit will face criminal charges as well as a ban from Anfield and the Etihad. City and Liverpool, who had worked together with respective supporters\u2019 groups before the game in an attempt to improve the atmosphere at the cup tie, issued a joint statement on Friday condemning the incidents.\nIt read: \u201cBoth clubs would like to thank the vast majority of fans for their behaviour at last night\u2019s Carabao Cup match at the Etihad Stadium. It is however hugely disappointing that there were a number of incidents during last night\u2019s match that are wholly unacceptable.\n\n\u201cThese incidents will be fully investigated, reported to the police and the individuals who are found to be responsible will be subject to the sanction process of their respective club. Manchester City FC and Liverpool FC are fully committed to working together to eradicate these issues from our fixtures. They have no place in football.\u201d\nLiverpool are working to identify those responsible for throwing objects from the away section. GMP\u2019s match commander, superintendent Gareth Parkin, added: \u201cWe are aware of a number of objects, including coins and a smoke bomb, that were thrown during the match. We will be investigating the incidents and reviewing CCTV from the night.\n\u201cClearly throwing objects in a confined area can be dangerous, and have serious and sometimes devastating consequences \u2013 GMP sends its thoughts and wishes to the girl who was injured and wish her a speedy recovery.\n\u201cTwo men were arrested on suspicion of trying to take a pyrotechnic into the ground and a male arrested for a racially aggravated public order offence. All three will be interviewed at a later date. A 53-year-old man was also assaulted after the game at the junction of Ashton New Road and Alan Turing Way. He was treated at the scene and required hospital treatment.\u201d"

Indonesia, the UAE, the Maldives, Jordan, Bahrain and Libya have joined Qatar, Kuwait, Iran, Saudi Arabia, Oman, and Afghanistan in lodging official complaints over comments from representatives of the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata party. Meanwhile hardline party members have reacted angrily to disciplinary action against the pair after their comments went viral in the Middle East. Indonesia, which has the largest number of Muslims in the world, summoned the Indian ambassador in Jakarta. \u201cIndonesia strongly condemns unacceptable derogatory remarks against Prophet Muhammad PBUH [peace be upon him] by two Indian politicians,\u201d read a tweet by the foreign ministry. Bahrain called on \u201cthe need to denounce any reprehensible insults against the Prophet Muhammad PBUH, as a provocation to Muslims\u2019 feelings and incitement to religious hatred\u201d. The BJP\u2019s attempt to quell the anger by suspending its national spokesperson, Nupur Sharma, and expelling its Delhi media head, Naveen Kumar Jindal, and dismissing them as \u201cfringe elements\u201d who did not represent the government\u2019s views has had little success in the Muslim world. And at home Hindu hardliners who have frequently targeted India\u2019s Muslim minority vented their anger over the climbdown, unusually for a party that has never faced any internal criticism in its eight years in power. Many praised Sharma, who made the remarks during a debate on a rightwing news channel, and expressed incredulity that a BJP government could buckle to pressure from Muslim countries. Jindal was expelled over a tweet he made about the prophet which has since been deleted. The hashtag \u201c#ShameOnBJP\u201d was trending on Twitter along with expressions of solidarity with the national spokesperson and, in a rare rebuke to Modi, hardliners have suggested that Uttar Pradesh\u2019s firebrand chief minister, Yogi Adityanath, might make a better prime minister. The party has contended that it cannot jeopardise India\u2019s extensive trade links with the Arab world, its need for Gulf oil, and the requirement to protect the 6.5 million Indians who live in the Gulf. Indian opposition leaders have meanwhile demanded the arrest of Sharma, who has told Delhi police she has received death threats, and Jindal, saying the action taken so far was a sham. The Congress party leader, Rahul Gandhi, accused the BJP of dividing India internally and weakening it externally. \u201cThe BJP\u2019s shameful bigotry has not only isolated us, but also damaged India\u2019s standing globally,\u201d he tweeted."

                    "body": "You might expect a feast of attacking rugby when two of Europe\u2019s great entertainers lock horns but this was a famine \u2013 played out in a flood. Harlequins will not care, for this was a gritty victory, delivered by Andr\u00e9 Esterhuizen\u2019s second-half try and founded on defensive resilience, against a thoroughly disappointing Racing 92 side. Equally, however, it was the sort of evening that makes you long for spring.  Harlequins were helped by a red card to Racing\u2019s No 8 Kitione Kamikamica after 50 minutes but after going down narrowly in Durban last week, this kickstarts their European campaign. Racing meanwhile, have lost their opening two matches and still have to play Leinster away \u2013 for the three-time finalists this is not looking likely to be their year. All be told, it was a rancid match, played out in even worse conditions. He wasn\u2019t having the best of games but that Finn Russell \u2013 whose lucrative move to Bath next season is set to be confirmed this week \u2013 was replaced after an hour summed up that it was not a day for players of his ilk. Empty seats are rarely seen here and though some supporters were evidently more interested in events in Qatar, some no doubt put off by the weather, the fact that there were plenty to be seen only adds currency to the debate that this competition is losing its allure. If organisers had hoped these two might put on a show to bust that theory, they were sorely disappointed. In the positives column for Harlequins was the performance of the 20-year-old Fin Baxter at loosehead on his first start, named man of the match for his showing up against far more heralded opposition while Danny Care\u2019s experience \u2013 as is so often the case \u2013 was significant too. As far as the neutrals are concerned, the hope can only be that things will improve in the reverse fixture in January in Racing\u2019s space-age indoor stadium. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t the prettiest and we did our best to ruin it but we\u2019re back in the hunt again,\u201d said the Harlequins coach Tabai Matson. \u201cIt\u2019s probably one of the most pleasing things when you have to defend, people putting their heads into hard places, and there was no shying away from that.\u201d Just as they did in South Africa last week, Harlequins struck early with the opening try after three minutes through George Head, who showed a turn of pace not usually associated with a hooker to take Care\u2019s flat pass and burst clear. Racing\u2019s defending left little to be desired but Head took his chance wonderfully, Tommy Allan converting for a 7-0 lead. A penalty from Russell got Racing on the board before he missed one he really ought to have scored but Harlequins were equally rueful soon after, unable to take advantage of a series of scrum penalties a few metres out from the visitors\u2019 line. Racing made them pay with their opening try in the final minute of the half, finished by Kamikamica from close range, after they had turned the screw in the Harlequins 22, enough to go in at half-time with a lead they barely deserved. It lasted less than 10 minutes after the restart, however, with Esterhuizen running on to Care\u2019s pass from the base of the scrum and bludgeoning his way over. Allan added the extras and just two minutes later Harlequins found themselves a man up when Kamikamica was sent off for a tip tackle on Nick David. It was unfortunate for Kamikamica in the sense that it was a dominant tackle on the onrushing fullback but given he lost control of David, who landed on his neck and shoulders, he could have no complaints. It seemed to galvanise Racing, to inhibit Harlequins but the visitors grew ever desperate, aware of what a second successive defeat would mean for their hopes of qualification. Harlequins, led by Alex Dombrandt and Will Evans, were at least resolute in defence and held firm for the final half an hour, eking out the type of victory that they are hardly accustomed to but as a result one that will please their coaches all the more."

                    "body": "One of the surprising and moving elements of running a football club is how regularly we hear from supporters who want to recognise and celebrate a loved one who is no longer with us. Before our first game of 2023, against Stockport County, we had a minute\u2019s celebration accompanied by a lone piper as we remembered all the supporters of the club who passed away in the previous 12 months. There isn\u2019t a week where we don\u2019t hear from a member of our community who has lost a loved one and wants them to be remembered and commemorated on a match day. In December we said farewell to Brian Taylor with a round of applause in the 63rd minute against Salford, marking his age when he passed away, and in the past couple of weeks we lost one of our oldest supporters, Milly (95) who I met with her family at our recent game against Stevenage. A lifelong commitment to a club, as Brian and Milly demonstrated, is impressive and life-affirming because it reinforces the social significance of sport and importance of emotion, memory and place. It\u2019s a privilege and is a constant reminder to me of the importance of football clubs and their ability to open an emotional space for celebration, particularly for those who might find the expression of emotion difficult elsewhere.  As the son of an absent father, some of my earliest memories are associated with playing and attending football. Outside of sport, there weren\u2019t many positive, adult male role models growing up in Grimsby in the 70s and early 80s. Certainly not many that were \u2018emotionally available\u2019. Like many places, the town was beginning the painful transition from old industrial jobs to the service economy, a fitful process and one that remains incomplete. It meant the men in our lives had worked at sea, on docks and in factories that most of us never would. It was the world Grayson Perry brought to life in his book The Descent of Man, reflecting on the kind of masculinity shaped by the harsh working environment of fishing trawlers, mining or steel mills. The mental and physical toughness needed to endure labouring jobs spilled out into the wider environment, one where hardness always threatened to erupt into violence without notice. Physical intimidation, the ability to hold your beer and take or throw a punch were the real currencies, along with playing and watching football. In town and with three brothers, I got plenty of experience of all of them. Over Christmas, I read Andrew O\u2019Hagan\u2019s book Mayflies before watching the TV adaptation. Both versions really touched me. The main theme was male friendship and love over time against the aforementioned industrial decline. It made me reflect on the role football, alongside music, plays as a primary driver of memories and opportunities to forge deep connections and relationships, particularly for men. I was struck by the physical affection of the main characters in the TV adaptation. The characters\u2019 shared experience of music replicated my experience of watching football. In my memory it was part of the only way men would be demonstrative with each other. The moments of ecstasy and abandon when a goal is scored or the final whistle declaring a result going your way. The shared experience of supporting a team through good and bad, the raising of voices together and singing in unity deeply imprints on the nature of our relationships in a way few other things can. As Professor Alan Bairner says: \u201cMen were uncomfortable with expressing their emotions, football and its spaces providing some of the few available loci for emotional outbursts.\u201d We are social creatures, driven by the need for attachment and relationships, which are proven to be the key drivers of happiness in people\u2019s lives. On a personal level it feels that physical displays of affection gradually started to find a place in our lives in the 90s. In part a combination of exposure to different cultures, the growing language and understanding of our psychology, and I imagine in no small way the prevalence of ecstasy around that time, that for some opened the male psyche to deeper, hitherto uncharted expressions of love and connection. The effects of this societal narrative are becoming clearer for men my age and we are much more aware of the challenges of mental health. We have made great strides in acknowledging the daily struggles for some people. At Grimsby Town FC we have partnered with the mental health organisation Navigo to think about how football can help men talk about and improve their mental health.  We know that men between the ages of 35-50, living alone and unemployed are at highest risk of taking their own lives. Those working in sectors such as construction and manufacturing have a higher risk and males with a Severe Mental Illness (SMI) are 2.8 to 7.1 times more likely to die before the age of 75 than males without SMI. Football clubs have a vital role to play in opening the space for deep connection. As Simon Beeton, Navigo\u2019s CEO, says: \u201cA place to be, a place to call home, a place to feel welcome and above all socialise.\u201d Football\u2019s toxic image of \u2018hypermasculinity\u2019 and outdated stereotypes have gradually been challenged and it is becoming a natural place to build positive relationships, share experiences and express ourselves. The EFL has taken steps to make the sport more inclusive, such as introducing the rainbow laces campaign which urges players and fans to show their support for the LGBTQ+ community, and since 2018 has had a partnership with Mind to create the On Your Side initiative focused on wellbeing. In our own small way, Grimsby Town are determined to play our part in building an environment of understanding, acceptance and connection that acknowledges the powerful importance of football in creating and sustaining relationships. We owe it to the memory of our loved ones, such as Brian and Milly, to ensure that football remains a place to honour and celebrate their lifelong passion for the game. It is our hope that in doing so, we can create a space for positive experiences that will make a difference to the mental health of our community. \u2022 Jason Stockwood is the chairman of Grimsby Town In the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123, or email jo@samaritans.org or jo@samaritans.ie.

                    "body": "Peter de Savary, who has died aged 78, liked to describe himself as a swashbuckling entrepreneur, adventurer and sportsman. He came to fame in the 1980s and 90s for his patriotic but unsuccessful attempts to win the America\u2019s Cup yacht race, with a series of expensive craft. A restless speculator, who would buy a derelict castle on a whim, he once owned both Land\u2019s End and John o\u2019Groats but his serendipitous business ventures could often be short-lived. He was an early Brexiter, and stood unsuccessfully for James Goldsmith\u2019s Referendum party in the 1997 general election. De Savary, a colourful and noisy figure who loved cigars and vintage cars, came close to a British triumph in the America\u2019s Cup in 1983 with his boat Victory 83, losing in the final heat to Alan Bond\u2019s Australia II. But his attempt to mount further challenges were unsuccessful and ended in 1994 when Placeton, the holding company for much of his interests, went into receivership with \u00a3200m debts and De Savary had to sell his homes. He bounced back, however, and rebuilt a rather smaller fortune, once estimated at \u00a334m, by concentrating on satisfying the tastes of the rich and famous for privacy in exclusive hotels. He transformed more than 60 hotels, seven championship golf courses, most attached to hotels, and three marinas. Most recently he had been living on a luxury houseboat on the Thames in London. De Savary was born in Burnham-on-Crouch, Essex. His father, John, who had been born in France, ran a pig farm. But when Peter was two, his parents separated and his mother, Vera, took him to live with her second husband, a Shell executive, in a Venezuelan oilfield. Despatched aged nine to Britain to board at prep school and then Charterhouse in Surrey, he never tired of saying how much he hated school. With a single O-level in scripture to his name, at 16 he was expelled after being found in bed with the headmaster\u2019s au pair. Rejecting the offer of an apprenticeship in the joinery business his father had established, he went to live with his mother in Canada and took a series of casual jobs before returning at 20 with his first wife, Marcia, and their child. Four years later, after quarrelling with his father and leaving the business, he was in so much debt that he had to sell his house and car. But his fortunes changed when in 1969 he met a widowed friend of his mother who was attempting to sell her husband\u2019s Dutch import and export business. De Savary borrowed the money to buy it from a friend and moved to The Hague where he developed the business, Afrex, much of it in Nigeria, which was in the process of rebuilding after the civil war; one of his partners was the president\u2019s brother.  Other ventures followed. His share in a Kuwaiti oil company led to a lifelong connection with the industry and he was involved with founding an ultimately unsuccessful bank in the Bahamas. Back in London, the now wealthy De Savary turned to providing hospitality for his counterparts; something that would help to define his life. Declaring that even expensive hotels were too often filled with people he did not like, in 1979 he founded the St James\u2019s Club, a boutique membership hotel for the rich, and rolled out the formula internationally (in New York, Antigua, Paris and Los Angeles), later selling out for many millions. At one point he tried to acquire the Mar-a-Lago complex in Florida, only to be outbid by Donald Trump. He bought into gaming, buying the Aspinalls casinos for \u00a390m in 1987 but selling them two years later because he said his mother did not approve of gambling. The impulsive De Savary bought and sold a long trail of country homes. In the mid-80s he bought on the Roseland peninsula in Cornwall. Though he claimed it was only intended as a private retreat, in less than two years, in a splurge, he had bought Falmouth docks, drawing up plans for a marina and residential complex there, started an oil bunkering service for passing ships, founded Pendennis Shipyard to build and service yachts, and acquired Land\u2019s End, which he turned into a theme park (it seemed inevitable that he should follow it with the purchase of land at John o\u2019Groats). It was seen as the largest investment in Cornwall for years but by 1992 he had relinquished nearly all his interests in the county, as once again he moved on. By 1985, De Savary was divorced from Marcia and had become engaged to Lana Paton, a former beauty queen whom he had met in South Carolina. But then he suddenly married his personal assistant Alice Simms in a ceremony in Gibraltar. Six weeks later, it was over and De Savary married Lana the following year. In 1987, the aircraft carrying them and his children crashed on a Caribbean reef, killing the pilot. The party were trapped in the upside-down aircraft before being rescued by a surfer. Later De Savary said, in an interview with the magazine Cigar Aficionado: \u201cAt that point my philosophy on life changed. When you genuinely look death in the eye, you know it\u2019s a pretty tenuous thing you are hanging on to.\u201d Property, with its lure of profitable development, was always a key part of De Savary\u2019s portfolio. As well as his Cornish interests, at various times he owned more than 200 acres on Canvey Island, Essex; planned a container port in Kent; invested in Southampton airport in 1988, in the then-unrealised hope of turning it into an international airport (he sold it to BAA in 1990); and acquired numerous hotel sites with surrounding land for development. The most dramatic was Skibo Castle \u2013 acquired in 1990 \u2013 a Victorian pile in Sutherland once belonging to the Scottish-American industrialist and philanthropist Andrew Carnegie. Up for auction when De Savary visited it in search of pictures connected to his wife\u2019s family, he found it so irresistible that he bought in within the week. After his financial meltdown in the early 90s, he turned Skibo into the first of a series of high-end international Carnegie Clubs, good enough to host the wedding of Madonna and Guy Ritchie in 2000, before once more selling on. In recent years, he had sold his latest country house on the basis that it should not be a burden to his wife after his death, while he also announced an apparent intention not to leave his fortune to his children: \u201cCarnegie\u2019s view was \u2018to die rich is to die disgraced\u2019; I wanted them to make their own way without that burden of my legacy.\u201d He is survived by Lana and their three daughters, and the two daughters from his first marriage.  \u2022 Peter de Savary, entrepreneur, born 11 July 1944; died 30 October 2022"

                    "body": "The first running of Newbury\u2019s most historic handicap chase in its new guise as the Coral Gold Cup is one of the most competitive renewals this century, with no fewer than five horses top-priced as 8-1 co-favourites on Friday morning and four more a point behind on 9-1.\nRemastered, a faller four out when going like the winner 12 months ago, may prove to be the pick of the market leaders, but despite the strength and depth of the field, it is a surprise to find Our Power (3.05) at a double-figure price a little further down the list.\n\nSam Thomas\u2019s seven-year-old was steadily progressive last season and put up a new career-best to win the London Gold Cup at Ascot in October, posting an excellent time in the process. Our Power remains unexposed beyond three miles, is proven on good ground and is an excellent bet at around 12-1 to give both Thomas and Sam Twiston-Davies, his jockey, a first win in this race.\nNewbury 1.20 Paul Nicholls had Kapcorse \u2013 who carries the famous colours of the late Sir Peter O\u2019Sullevan \u2013 ready to win this race run in O\u2019Sullevan\u2019s memory first time up last year and a 6lb rise in the weights may not be enough to prevent a repeat performance.\nNewcastle 1.35 Malinello has a long absence to overcome on his chasing debut but Ben Pauling has an impressive record with horses returning from a layoff and the seven-year-old\u2019s brief hurdling career in 2020-21 suggests his opening mark is more than fair.\nNewbury 1.55 Lightly-raced mare West Balboa has excellent prospects of making a winning handicap debut off 127 having finished within seven lengths of Stage Star in last year\u2019s Challow Hurdle over track and trip.\n\nNewcastle 2.10 Seven days later than planned, Constitution Hill returns to action with at least a stone in hand of his field on Timeform\u2019s ratings and anything other than a third Grade One win from four starts over hurdles will be one of the shocks of the season.\nNewbury 2.30 Nicky Henderson has two runners as he looks for a third win in this race in four years and Theatre Glory, an impressive winner off an 8lb lower mark at Kelso in March, could be the pick of them with useful conditional Nathan Brennan taking off 7lb.\n\nNewcastle 3.25 A tough assignment for L\u2019Homme Presse, last season\u2019s Brown Advisory Novice Chase winner at Cheltenham, as he returns to action in a handicap off a mark of 164. At the likely odds, Into Overdrive looks a better bet at around 4-1, as he gets 22lb from the favourite and has the benefit of a run this season.\nNewbury 3.40 Amarillo Sky has returned in excellent form and should follow up his recent win at Cheltenham\u2019s November meeting.\nChamp beats Paisley Park in thriller\nChamp and Paisley Park, the veterans in a five-horse field, produced a memorable finish to the Grade Two Long Distance Hurdle at Newbury on Friday, with Champ holding the late charge of his fellow 10-year-old, Paisley Park, by a neck ahead of what is likely to be a rematch in the Long Walk Hurdle at Ascot in three weeks\u2019 time.\nChamp set out to make all the running under Jonjo O\u2019Neill jnr and looked set for a straightforward success as Paisley Park came under pressure on the run to the second-last. The former Stayers\u2019 Hurdle winner kept finding more for Aidan Coleman, however, and the gap between the two horses was down to less than two lengths at the final flight.\nThey were separated by the width of the track as Paisley Park continued to eat into Champ\u2019s lead all the way to the line, but Nicky Henderson\u2019s runner had just enough in the tank to get over the line.\n\n\u201cOur old boy has won an RSA Chase over fences and everybody adores him,\u201d Henderson told Racing TV afterwards. \u201cHe\u2019s got the most lovely character and he\u2019s such a sweet horse. AP [McCoy] rode him in a gallop here 10 days ago and he thought he was in great form, but he does have his ailments as well. He\u2019s a bit creaky, like all of us at that age.\n\u201cYou could see we were travelling and Paisley Park was off the bridle, but you can never write him off. You can never read Paisley Park, he might stand still at the start and still come and beat you.\nHe\u2019s a bizarre character, but he\u2019s a phenomenal horse with a phenomenal team and I\u2019m sure we\u2019re going to meet again in three weeks\u2019 time.\u201d\nHenderson was completing a double after Jet Powered\u2019s impressive 11-length success in the card\u2019s novice hurdle, a performance which saw the five-year-old installed as an 8-1 chance for the Supreme Novice Hurdle at Cheltenham in March.\nThe card\u2019s Grade Two novice chase, meanwhile, produced a surprise as Sebastopol, the 22-1 outsider of four runners, stayed on strongly to beat Paul Nicholls\u2019s Stage Star, the 2-7 favourite, by five lengths."

                    "body": "Steve Clarke has admitted to serious doubts that Scotland\u2019s World Cup play-off semi-final against Ukraine will take place on its rescheduled early June date. Ukraine\u2019s visit to Hampden Park, originally set for Thursday, was postponed due to Russia\u2019s invasion of the country. It has since emerged that several of Ukraine\u2019s squad have signed up for military service. Scotland will host Poland in a friendly instead, with \u00a310 from every ticket sold being donated to Unicef\u2019s Ukrainian aid efforts.  Provisional Uefa and Fifa plans involve Scotland facing Ukraine on a June date originally intended for Nations League fixtures, with the winners to face Wales or Austria days later for a World Cup place. Clarke, while adamant the semi-final should take place if at all possible, is sceptical about that happening in little more than two months. \u201cThe very short answer is \u2018no\u2019,\u201d the Scotland manager said when asked whether there had been an update on the play-off. \u201cI would imagine everyone is waiting until this round of matches is out of the way and then see how the situation develops. But, obviously, it\u2019s not looking great at this moment. \u201cIf you\u2019re asking me now will the game go ahead in June then it\u2019s going to be difficult,\u201d Clarke added. \u201cBut it\u2019s a situation we can\u2019t control, so I\u2019ll focus on these two friendlies and make sure we get something out of the games in this camp. \u201cThen, maybe in April, we can all sit down together, look at the schedule and how it\u2019s going to pan out for us. It\u2019s difficult to see how we\u2019ll be playing them in June and it\u2019s not just about the fixture \u2013 it\u2019s the fact that they need to get together, have a training camp and get all their players on the pitch with a proper period of time to prepare for such an important game. \u201cAndriy Shevchenko, who I know from my time at Chelsea, spoke quite well about the situation and said they would want to play on the pitch. The way the situation is I think they should get as much time as possible to try to make that game happen, Scotland against Ukraine at Hampden.\u201d It remains unclear what would happen if June proves an unviable option. The game could be pushed into the September international window. \u201cWe have to be guided by Fifa, Uefa and most importantly by Ukraine themselves,\u201d Clarke added. \u201cIt\u2019s just a horrible, horrible situation and the quicker we know we\u2019re going to play Ukraine at Hampden the better because it will mean the war has stopped and we\u2019re all trying to move forward again. We have to be guided by other people and hope and pray that the situation improves enough for the fixture to go ahead at some time.\u201d  The Scotland captain, Andrew Robertson, will miss the Poland match because of illness, but the Liverpool full-back may return for the friendly against Wales or Austria on Tuesday. Clarke is expected to name his strongest available team, with Everton\u2019s Nathan Patterson likely to play at right-back despite a shortage of domestic minutes since his \u00a311m January move from Rangers. The Poland head coach, Czeslaw Michniewicz, in charge of the team for the first time, denied he would shuffle his pack drastically with next week\u2019s play-off final against Sweden or the Czech Republic in mind."

AS\u2022 Barbican Art Gallery, London, 8 September-8 January. Winslow Homer: Force of Nature This great US artist lived and painted through the American civil war and went on to paint seascapes that are mysterious allegories of history. His masterpiece The Gulf Stream, in which a man on a broken boat waits for the sharks, suggests a country doomed by racism. The American Turner. JJ\u2022 National Gallery, London, 10 September-8 January. Lindisfarne Gospels  The most beautiful manuscript of Anglo-Saxon England returns to the north-east where it was created in about AD700. It was written out and sumptuously illustrated with holy portraits and Islamic-style abstract patterns by Eadfrith, Bishop of Lindisfarne, nearly a century before the Vikings raided this sacred island.

Apartheid haunts Kentridge but he transposes his country\u2019s troubled story on to an epic global canvas of history, philosophy and science. His films and theatre works all grow out of a gift for drawing, and intensely beautiful charcoal studies underpin everything. AS\u2022 Royal Academy, London, 24 September-11 December. Hallyu! The Korean Wave  How often can you see images from Squid Game alongside 19th-century Korean paintings of courtesans? This survey of South Korea\u2019s world-conquering pop culture looks back into history as well as spanning everything from Gangnam Style to Parasite, with art including Gwon Osang\u2019s kitsch painted sculpture of a mythical dragon fight. JJ\u2022 V&amp;A, London, 24 September-25 June. Hollow Earth: Art, Caves and the Subterranean Imaginary Delve deep in this exploration of what lies beneath. Everyone from Ren\u00e9 Magritte to Robert Smithson, Joseph Wright of Derby, Jeff Wall and Brassa\u00ef are here, along with doomsday bunkers, places of magic and horror, refuge and entombment. A portable underworld, the show will travel to Cork and Exeter in 2023. AS\u2022 Nottingham Contemporary, 24 September-22 January. Forrest Bess: Out of the Blue The beautiful, queer, semi-abstract paintings of Forrest Bess are as enigmatic and strange as the Texas painter\u2019s life. Laden with private symbolism, and driven by a yearning to achieve a state of immortality by becoming a hermaphrodite, Bass\u2019s art is as inventive and rigorous as his story is alarming. AS\u2022 Camden Arts Centre, London, 30 September-15 January. Lucian Freud: New Perspectives  It is a century since Lucian Freud was born in Berlin. This exhibition tries to stand back from his fame to see his art in the bigger picture of art history and so, maybe, allow us to judge his achievements. How do his paintings look alongside the Titians and Corots he loved? JJ\u2022 National Gallery, London, 1 October-22 January. C\u00e9zanne The exhibition of the year. Paul C\u00e9zanne invented modern art by looking hard at mountains, ruins, rocks and apples. He looked beyond the impressionists to find abstraction inside appearances. His art is about the struggle to see in restless, endless glances and gazes that grasp fragments of truth in the heat. JJ\u2022 Tate Modern, London, 5 October-12 March. Kamala Ibrahim Ishag A vociferous champion of women\u2019s rights and artistic freedom, Kamala Ibrahim Ishag has lived and painted in her home city of Khartoum for most of her career, after studying at London\u2019s Royal College of Art in the mid 1960s. Now in her 80s, she has been influenced by Sudanese folklore and spiritualism, by William Blake and Francis Bacon, as well as contemporary political events.

Cerith Wyn Evans Winner of the 2019 Hepworth sculpture prize, the Llanelli-born artist returns to Wales for his largest UK show to date. With his complex works using sound and light, neon, music and language, Wyn Evans makes startling environments and situations.

Cecilia Vicu\u00f1a From bold early paintings that portray radical heroes to installations that use textiles and thread on an enveloping scale, this Chilean artist has campaigned for new ways of seeing the world since the 1970s. Her installation in Britain\u2019s biggest art space is likely to be a magic realist eco-feminist spectacular. JJ\u2022 Tate Modern Turbine Hall, London, 11 October-16 April. Hieroglyphs: Unlocking Ancient Egypt  Ancient Egypt has always inspired awe and wonder. Renaissance popes put up Egyptian obelisks and Shelley marvelled at the colossus of Ramses the Great. But what did it all mean? This blockbuster centred on the Rosetta Stone reveals how it helped decipher hieroglyphs and decode Egypt\u2019s fascinating mythology and history.

Turner prize Sculpture, moving image, photography, the voice and the image come together in what should be a real humdinger of a Turner prize, returning to Tate Liverpool this year. The shortlist, with Heather Phillipson, Veronica Ryan, Ingrid Pollard and Sin Wai Kin, makes for a show as entertaining as it is serious, affecting as it is spirited. AS\u2022 Tate Liverpool, 20 October-19 March. Hannah Starkey Belfast-born photographer Hannah Starkey has long deserved a major museum survey. Her carefully staged images have, throughout her career, sought to portray the relationships between women and the environment. Often monumentally scaled, and moving between public and private spaces, from reflective moments to street protests, Starkey reveals dramas and stillness, witnessing tension and curiosity, the unguarded and the vulnerable. AS\u2022 Hepworth Wakefield, 20 October-30 April. Lynette Yiadom-Boakye: Fly in League With the Night This engrossing survey of work by a highly original painter was so cruelly closed by the pandemic that it\u2019s getting a relaunch. Yiadom-Boakye creates imaginary portraits of Black people. Her intimate, haunting closeups bloom into epic history paintings. She is making up for centuries of exclusion with her counterfactual art museum. JJ\u2022 Tate Britain, London, 24 November-26 February. Architecture and design Objects of Desire: Surrealism and Design 1924-Today A lobster telephone, bicycle saddle chair and sofa shaped like a big pair of red lips will descend on the Design Museum this October, showing how surrealist art has influenced the world of design from the 1920s to the present \u2013 culminating in gloopy 3D-printed furniture, sketched out in mid-air using motion capture. OW\u2022 Design Museum, London, 14 October-19 February. Plastic: Remaking Our World From revolutionary wonder material to dastardly scourge of the planet, the meteoric rise and fall of plastic will be charted in this new exhibition that examines its 150-year history. Bakelite telephones will rub shoulders with trainers made with plastic harvested from the oceans, alongside a glimpse of the fungal future of bioplastics grown from mycelium. OW\u2022 V&amp;A Dundee, 29 October-5 February. Al Janoub stadium, Qatar  After decades of cities being assaulted by phallic towers, now comes the great yonic monument to swallow them all. Designed by the late Zaha Hadid, the Al Janoub stadium rises out of the Qatari desert in a magnificent vulvic bulge, its rooftop sculpted in sinuous labial lips that sweep open to frame the football pitch, cradled womblike within. Will sports correspondents struggle to find the press box? OW\u2022 Qatar, November. Horror in the Modernist Block Move over, gothic haunted house! The modernist block is where horror truly lies, according to a new exhibition in Birmingham, a city that\u2019s no stranger to the terrifying power of modernist urban planning. Here, contemporary artists will explore how modernism in architecture, fiction, film and art has been used to tap into our deepest fears. OW\u2022 Ikon Gallery, Birmingham, 25 November-1 May. Battersea Power Station After lying derelict for the past 40 years, Battersea\u2019s majestic brick temple of electricity will finally reopen its doors this autumn, now stuffed full of shops, bars and restaurants. It will be crowned with a \u201cchimney lift experience\u201d, whisking visitors 100 metres up for a perfect view of the surrounding car crash of luxury flats. OW\u2022 London SW8, autumn."

                    "body": "What a mess. Gareth Southgate knew that he needed a win to restore a measure of calm after a deeply unconvincing start to this Nations League campaign, which had brought two points from the first three ties and one goal; none from open play. What the England manager got was a new and tortuous low \u2013 the heaviest defeat of his near six-year England tenure, the nation\u2019s worst home loss since 1928 and a mutiny among the home crowd here at Molineux.\nThe fans had started to make for the exits when Roland Sallai scored his second goal of the evening to put Hungary 2-0 up, the boos ringing out, and it was at that point that everything fell apart for Southgate and his team.\n\nPreviously, England had lacked inspiration, coming to look more and more unnerved as the chuntering from the home support rose inexorably. Now Hungary put them to the sword, their substitutes rushing on to the pitch as two more goals went in. At full time, they would dance in front of the visiting enclosure, wreathed in smiles, barely able to believe it.\nIt felt almost surreal when Zsolt Nagy lashed home the third. \u201cYou don\u2019t know what you\u2019re doing,\u201d bellowed the fans at Southgate, more of them leaving, hurling abuse as they did.\n\nIt was toxic and even worse was to follow. It had been a dreadful evening for John Stones, although he was hardly alone, and the nadir came when he was sent off for a harsh second yellow card. He did not know that the substitute Daniel Gazdag was behind him; the Hungary player simply ran into him.\nSouthgate responded by introducing Harry Maguire for Bukayo Saka, which prompted yet more boos. Poor Maguire. \u201cYou\u2019re getting sacked in the morning,\u201d came the cry from the stands for the manager.\nThe humiliation was complete when another substitute, Adam Nagy, played a straight pass, Maguire stood still and Kyle Walker chased back but he could not prevent Gazdag from clipping over Aaron Ramsdale.\nSouthgate was motionless in his technical area. At full time, he walked out on to the pitch and \u2013 bravely or foolishly \u2013 applauded the crowd. He had to know what would come back and he was not disappointed.\nSouthgate had seen nothing go right from start to finish \u2013 not his 4-3-3 system in the first half, nor the 3-5-2 after the interval. Too often his players were bullied in the one-on-ones, particularly by the big Hungary No 9, Adam Szalai, and, too often, their decision-making or end product was poor. Too often, moves ran into dead ends; the inspiration absent, the tempo ponderous.\nThe closest England came to a goal was when Harry Kane looped a header against the crossbar on 77 minutes. He chased down the rebound before crumpling to the ground under no challenge; a lamentable dive that summed things up.\nEngland find themselves starring at relegation from this Nations League group, which would not only be damaging in terms of optics but also on a practical level, raising the possibility of a tougher Euro 2024 qualifying draw. The big, fat worry is what it all means for the World Cup, which kicks off on 21 November.\nIt will be a long summer of introspection for Southgate and, thereafter, he has only two more matches before the opening tie in Qatar \u2013 against Italy and Germany in the Nations League in late September. Things can unravel pretty quickly in football, particularly in volatile environments such as that which England inhabit. Southgate had promised last Friday not to overstay his welcome in the job. Those words hung heavy in the Wolverhampton air.\n\nRemarkably, this was England\u2019s fourth meeting of the season with Hungary, the previous one having come on the Saturday before last, a game that Adam Nagy had called \u201cthe debacle in Budapest\u201d. He was judging it from an England point of view, Southgate\u2019s team having been flat in the 1-0 loss. What of this?\nEngland set the tone with the first concession. Adam Lang rose with Stones to meet a Dominik Szoboszlai free-kick and Kane miskicked his attempted clearance to leave the unmarked Sallai with the shooting chance. The forward\u2019s first touch was true; he blasted the second past the exposed Ramsdale.\nJarrod Bowen had mistimed his jump on a header at 0-0 and the anxiety in the stands was tangible after the first goal, along with the sense of foreboding because Hungary are so tough to break down. When Stones dwelled in possession on 23 minutes, the home crowd howled. England were on egg shells.\nIt would have been 2-0 in the 27th minute but for an excellent goalline clearance by Reece James. When England broke quickly, Bowen fluffed the final action. England consistently lacked conviction on the ball.\nEngland were booed off at half-time. It is the rule. Their only other moment of note had been when Willi Orban headed a Saka cross towards his own goal to draw a save out of Denes Dibusz.\nThe cat calls would only grow in intensity, starting when Kalvin Phillips was robbed by the substitute Martin Adam who played in Sallai. The finish was low and lethal. England, though, had fresh depths to plumb."

Here\u2019s just some of what we learned:\n\u2022 Melbourne\u2019s Crown casino was slapped with $120m in fines for breaches of its responsible service of gambling obligations.\n\u2022 The federal government announced a review into migration, looking at the visa system, how people interact with it, the potential for criminals to take advantage of loopholes to traffic people, and whether it can address Australia\u2019s labour shortages.\n\u2022 Medibank announced to the ASX a confirmation they will not pay the ransom hackers have demanded not to release information from its data breach. Medibank also confirmed the hackers accessed the name, date of birth, address, phone number and email address for around 9.7m current and former customers.\n\u2022 Independent senators Jacquie Lambie and David Pocock called for the government to split its industrial relations bill, with the latter arguing it had been very rushed, and that splitting it would see low-paid people get pay rises faster.\n\u2022 Traditional owners from the Torres Strait built a mock seawall outside Parliament House, in a bid to get Labor to go further on climate action and protect their islands.\n\u2022 The attorney general\u2019s department told Senate estimates that it did not provide advice to Christian Porter before the then attorney general advised Scott Morrison on the way he could be appointed to multiple ministries.\n\u2022 Australian Electoral Commission disclosures revealed that Atlassian founder Scott Farquhar was the biggest donor to the six successful teal independent candidates, followed by fellow co-founder Mike Cannon-Brookes\u2019 climate campaigning entity, Boundless Earth.\n\u2022 And the head of the Fair Work Commission, Justice Iain Ross, has announced his retirement, effective 18 November.\nThanks for sticking with us. We\u2019ll be back tomorrow.\n\nUpdated at 7.43am GMT\n\n\n 7.06am  \n\nCost-cutting at the Parliament House cafeteria\nBrace yourself for a very Canberra Bubble update, but the Department of Parliamentary Services has confirmed that the decision to cut back the variety of food at the Parliament House staff cafeteria was indeed due to cost-cutting.\nIf you do not work in this palace of democracy your eyes may glaze over here, but the cafeteria used to switch up its bain-marie buffet menu in the middle of the week, with one set of food for the first few days and an entirely different one for the back end of the week.\nRecently the cafeteria upped the price of coffee and also food as inflation pressures came for Canberra too, before APH occupants also noticed the midweek menu change had also fallen by the wayside.\nA sometimes frankly baffling combination of buffet items now sticks around for a whole week. Coalition senator James McGrath asked DPS in a Senate estimates hearing this afternoon what happened to the variety?\n\u201cI\u2019m asking this on behalf of some of the staff who are in the building full-time,\u201d McGrath asked secretary Rob Stefanic, saying his question went to looking after \u201cthe brilliant staff\u201d who work in APH:\n\nI ask this with seriousness ... on behalf of staff and not my stomach.\n\nStefanic said DPS was looking to improve the level of service for building occupants, with the midweek menu change aiming to give \u201cvariety\u201d for staff. But he also noted that costs had to go up:\n\nAs part of the cost side we reduced it back to a single menu through the week.\n\n\nUpdated at 7.15am GMT\n\n\n 6.58am  \n\nHere\u2019s the Minister for Home Affairs, Clare O\u2019Neil, making a statement on the Medibank ransom demand and the company\u2019s refusal to pay it. \nMedibank\u2019s decision is consistent with Australian government advice, she says: \n\n\n\n\n 6.46am  \nRobodebt scheme was 'oversold' in briefing to Morrison: DHS official\n\nThe robodebt scheme was \u201coversold\u201d by the Department of Human Services when it was briefed to Scott Morrison, an official from DHS has told a royal commission.\nChristopher Birrer, the deputy chief executive at DHS\u2019s successor agency Services Australia, told the inquiry on Monday there had been more than 860,000 welfare debts flagged as potential overpayments in advice provided to Morrison in early 2015. But he said this was never going to lead to the budget savings promised. Morrison was social services minister at the time.\nAsked it had been \u201coversold\u201d from the beginning, Birrer replied:\n\nIt was terribly oversold, commissioner... I\u2019ve used the phrase, like a \u2018slam dunk\u2019, that this [debt] was out there to get. Even if averaging was lawful, DHS would never have recovered what was in that executive minute.\n\nBirrer added:\n\nIt\u2019s disappointing that the benefits were oversold and the risks understated.\n\nHolmes said:\n\nIt\u2019s the chemical weapons in Iraq, slam dunk sort of thing.\n\nBirrer only joined the agency in 2020, five years after the robodebt scheme was established, and also months after it had been wound up.\nWith hindsight, he said a crucial moment was the failure of DHS to emphasise the legal concerns held by the Department of Social Services in its February brief to Morrison.\nThese had shared between high ranking officials from both departments in January 2015, and then \u201cwatered down\u201d though still included in the advice provided to Morrison the following month.\nBirrer said another issue was a \u201cdemanding and difficult leadership environment\u201d with \u201caggressive and demanding leadership\u201d. He said this conduct was, according to the recollections of others, \u201cinappropriate\u201d:\n\nThere was an attempt to essentially make it look like everything was fine.\n\nThe commission continues.\n\nUpdated at 6.52am GMT\n\n\n 6.37am  \n\nMichael Manetta, the AAT member who says he was benched for deciding cases against the government, has commented on evidence in Senate Estimates that he has been reinstated to the social security division.\nManetta told Guardian Australia his complaint had been \u201cgrossly mishandled from beginning to end\u201d, but declined to say more citing the confidentiality of the process. Manetta\u2019s complaint concluded with a resolution to reinstate him on 4 October, and he\u2019ll be back hearing cases by 15 November.\nIn Estimates, officials said they couldn\u2019t say more because of the privacy of the parties.\n\n\n\n 6.36am  \nSplit the bill to help low-paid people now: David Pocock\n\nThe independent senator, David Pocock, has responded to Labor\u2019s \u201cget wages moving\u201d rhetoric by noting that the whole point of splitting the IR bill would be to help the low-paid sooner.\nPocock said:\n\nIt\u2019s good to see the government addressing many of the concerns I and others have raised with the amendments they have announced today. I\u2019m working through the details of the fairly substantial amendments the government is proposing.\nIn order to urgently deliver pay rises for the lowest paid workers, the government should move forward with the supported (low paid) and co-operative multi-enterprise bargaining streams now.\nI look forward to continuing constructive engagement with the government, including on matters not covered in today\u2019s updates and the more complex changes in the bill to make sure we get them right.\n\n\n\nUpdated at 6.55am GMT\n\n\n 6.30am  \n\nFirst Dog on the Moon has taken on robodebt today.\n\nRead that, but then also read Luke Henriques-Gomes\u2019 report from the actual robodebt royal commission hearings (spoiler: satire is dead and not remotely funny):\n\n\nUpdated at 6.38am GMT\n\n\n 6.25am  \n\nWalgett, Collarenebri and Lightning Ridge completely isolated due to flooding\nThe New South Wales State Emergency Service has sent through an update about its work in the flood areas.\nWalgett, Collarenebri and Lightning Ridge have been completely isolated thanks to major flooding, with the Castlereagh Highway closed for almost a week.\nThey have 16 helicopters assisting with supplies to communities and in partnership with emergency services, they\u2019re running regular ferry services by boat to stranded residents at Gingie and Namoi on the outskirts of Walgett.\nThere have been 268 requests for assistance in the 24 hours to 2pm today \u2013 18 of those have been flood rescues.\nThere are currently 103 NSW SES warnings current, 15 at emergency, 65 at watch and act and 23 at advice.\n\nUpdated at 6.32am GMT\n\n\n 6.13am  \nAAT officials pressed in Senate estimates over tribunal member's complaint\n\nIn Senate estimates, Greens senator David Shoebridge has interrogated Administrative Appeals Tribunal officials about the complaint of a member of the tribunal who said he was benched from hearing social security cases because he decided too many against the government.\nIn May Michael Manetta told Guardian Australia that the AAT deputy president, Karen Synon, a former Liberal senator, expressed concern in June 2021 about the number of appeals against his decisions by the Department of Social Services before he was benched in September in a bid to increase \u201cconsistency\u201d between tribunal members\u2019 decisions.\n\nOn Monday the AAT\u2019s registrar, Michael Hawkins, told Senate Estimates:\nThere was a complaint made to the president and the president has consulted with the parties and a conclusion has been reached ... I understand Mr Manetta is practising in the same field again ... He is now hearing matters in the [social security] division.\n\nHawkins refused to give any other details about the complaint, how it was handled and the conclusion - citing the privacy of the parties.\nIn May, Manetta had branded the decision to bench him \u201ccompletely incompatible with the rule of law\u201d and warned it \u201cundermines the impartiality and independence of the tribunal\u201d.\nSynon said she categorically denies \u201cany implication or inference that I have acted in any manner that is not fair, impartial and just in the exercise of my statutory duties at the AAT\u201d.\n\nUpdated at 6.23am GMT\n\n\n 6.01am  \n\nFederal immigration minister, Andrew Giles, has been speaking to the ABC where he was asked about reports published in the Australian \u201csuggesting you are being used as a fundraising machine for Victorian premier Daniel Andrews [in the Victorian state election], particularly in multicultural communities\u201d.\nGiles responds:\n\nTime to time I, like all politicians, \u2026 support other candidates for fundraising. I do so when I am asked, if I support the candidate or cause. When I do so, and always report, they are matters I have attended to by myself in my own time, driving my own car. Sharing my perspective on the portfolio issues I am responsible for, expressing, not dealing with any individual issues, I always conduct myself with integrity and carrying out my duties, that\u2019s a really critical part of any public office is to maintain a public trust.\n\n\nUpdated at 6.09am GMT\n\n\n 5.47am  \n\nQatar rejects calls for compensation for killed and injured World Cup workers\nQatar has rejected calls for a compensation fund for migrant workers killed or injured during World Cup preparations, with the country\u2019s labour minister labelling it a \u201cpublicity stunt\u201d.\nLabour minister Ali bin Samikh Al Marri said Qatar had already handed out hundreds of millions of dollars in unpaid wages and accused the Gulf state\u2019s critics of \u201cracism\u201d.\nMarri said Qatar already has a fund to deal with worker deaths and injuries. He told AFP:\n\nOur door is open. We have dealt with and resolved a lot of cases.\nIf there is a person entitled to compensation who has not received it, they should come forward and we will help them.\n\nControversy has surrounded Qatar\u2019s World Cup preparations, particularly over consistent alleged human rights abuses against migrant workers and the rights of LGBTQI+ people in the country.\nOn Friday, Football Australia was presented with a petition of almost 5,500 signatures calling on the organisation to publicly support a compensation fund to support any migrant workers injured \u2013 and the families of those killed \u2013 working on preparations for the Qatar World Cup.\nBe Slavery Free, a charity focused on ending slavery, presented Football Australia with the petition that stated:\n\nWhen Qatar was awarded the 2022 World Cup, almost 12 years ago, it had very little infrastructure (three football stadiums) or labour (one million population) to support such a mammoth global event. In the years since, thousands of migrant workers, mostly from Asia and Africa flocked to the Gulf state to make the Fifa World Cup possible.\nAlarming reports of abuse, exploitation and forced labour of workers resulting in serious harm and death have not ceased since.\nHowever, very little has been done to remedy the situation.\n\nIn a statement, Be Slavery Free said:\n\nLast week, Football Australia and the Socceroos both released statements supporting the establishment of a Migrant Workers Centre but they have stopped short of calling for reparations for the workers who have been injured and the 6,500 or more families who have lost loved ones.\nWith global partners Freedom United, Be Slavery Free is asking Football Australia to publicly support a compensation fund for migrant workers, equivalent to the prize money of US$440 million. Football Australia was given a petition of almost 5,500 signatures asking for this.\n\nLast week the president of Fifa, Gianni Infantino, took the unusual step of writing to all 32 nations competing at this month\u2019s World Cup, urging them to \u201clet football take the stage\u201d in Qatar.\nHere\u2019s some more background to this story:\n\n\nUpdated at 6.12am GMT\n\n\n 5.33am  \n\nAnother severe thunderstorm warning for heavy rainfall \u2013 this time for New South Wales and parts of the ACT. It comes on the back of more general thunderstorm warnings earlier this afternoon, though I suspect people in the region are already aware of it\u2026\n\n\n\n\n 5.27am  \n\nRudd suggests government department turned blind eye to News Corp\nFormer prime minister Kevin Rudd\u2019s staff accused an Australian government department of taking a \u201cdon\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell\u201d approach to News Corp after finding the media company did not need to register under the foreign influence scheme.\nDocuments obtained by Guardian Australia reveal the Attorney General\u2019s Department dismissed two cases that the former prime minister suggested may require News Corp to disclose activities under the scheme.\nIn a letter released under freedom of information laws, Rudd cited the reporting by the Saturday Telegraph in May 2020 about Covid\u2019s origins, which appeared under the headline \u201cChina\u2019s batty science: Bombshell dossier lays out the case against the People\u2019s Republic\u201d.\nThe details in this \u201cworld exclusive\u201d were attributed to \u201ca dossier prepared by concerned western governments\u201d. Rudd drew attention to previously published advice by Bret Walker SC.\nRudd wrote in the October 2021 letter:\n\nThis advice noted that, in the absence of an exemption for media activities, any decision of News Corp Australia to receive and distribute information on behalf of a foreign government seeking to influence political discourse in Australia would be registrable.\n\nRead the exclusive report here:\n\n\nUpdated at 5.41am GMT\n\n\n 5.15am  \nPaying ransom would \u2018increase risk of extortion for customers\u2019: Medibank chief\n\nMedibank\u2019s chief executive, David Koczkar, has been speaking to ABC\u2019s Afternoon Briefing, about the fact that the accounts of 9.7m current and former customers of Medibank and its subsidiary, AHM, were accessed in a data breach.\nMedibank announced today it will not pay a ransom to the alleged hacker. The company is, however, offering some compensation for some customers.\nKoczkar said:\n\nLast week we announced a hardship package for those particularly vulnerable customers who may be victims of cybercrime, I encourage anyone who needs support to contact Medibank through one of our dedicated cybercrime phone lines or through our scam emails. Also, if customers prefer, they can contact the government through cyber website with the reports to raise an incident if they have been a victim of cybercrime.\nWe stand ready to support our customers in the event that they become impacted by this cybercrime in the event of the criminal contacts them, in the event that they are extorted.\n\nThe fact that they refused to pay a ransom was partly due to the fact that there was only limited chance that it would make customers\u2019 data any safer, Koczkar said.\n\nBased on extensive advice we\u2019ve heard from cybercrime experts, there\u2019s only a small chance that any extortion payment would actually return the data of our customers. There is actually a strong chance that any payment would actually increase the risk of extortion for our customers and actually put more strain this is a decision that consistent with the Government policy on rent somewhere and this is why we\u2019ve made a decision to not pay this ransom.\n\nFor more on this, check out Josh Taylor\u2019s earlier story:\n\n\nUpdated at 6.23am GMT\n\n\n 5.08am  \n\nMore details on ban of political fundraisers at Parliament House\nWe\u2019ve got a little more info on the recently reported ban on political fundraisers inside Parliament House, instituted by the prime minister, Anthony Albanese.\nThe Department of Parliamentary Services told a Senate estimates hearing that nine functions called up DPS to cancel their events when news of the ban was made public before budget week.\nDPS officials also said future bookings for events inside Parliament House will include a section where applicants must confirm their shindig isn\u2019t a political fundraiser. If there\u2019s any doubt, DPS will further investigate and ask applicants to sign a statutory declaration about the event.\nRob Stefanic, secretary of the Department of Parliamentary Services, told the hearing that a final policy is currently being signed off by the presiding officers of the House and Senate.\nHe said the definition of banned political events includes:\n\n\u2026 those organised by registered political parties and/or candidates for public office and/or any third party where funds are collected in connection to the event for the purpose of donating raised funds to a political party, campaign and/or candidate.\n\n\nUpdated at 6.10am GMT\n\n\n 4.59am  \n\nDepartment rules that TikTok is OK for politicians\nThe federal Department of Parliamentary Services says it doesn\u2019t believe politicians or parliament employees need to avoid downloading apps like TikTok to their work phones, despite such recommendations being made in other parliaments.\nAppearing before a Senate estimates committee hearing on Monday afternoon, Liberal senator James Paterson \u2013 who has long raised concerns about security concerns about the Chinese-owned social media app \u2013 noted that parliaments in New Zealand and the United States had warned against the use of TikTok on political phones.\nA DPS official said they were aware of that advice from overseas equivalents, but hadn\u2019t received similar recommendations that Australia should follow suit:\n\nWe work closely with our partners at the five parliaments, the other parliaments around the world, and my understanding of that advice they provided is it was related to specific advice they\u2019d received from other agencies in their country and we haven\u2019t received an equivalent level of advice to us that would warrant us to be providing that advice to parliamentarians.\n\nPaterson, chair of the parliament\u2019s intelligence and security committee under the previous government, noted some federal departments had given such advice to their employees to not use TikTok on work phones.\nDPS said it did not make similar recommendations, and said it had not recommended employees or politicians only use social media on a personal (not work) device.\nFor some background:\n\n\nUpdated at 5.04am GMT\n\n\n 4.50am  \n\nDon\u2019t take any easing of those Melbourne storms as evidence they\u2019ve gone away, either:\n\n\n\n\n 4.43am  \nBureau issues severe thunderstorm warning for parts of Melbourne\n\nThe Bureau of Meteorology has issued a severe thunderstorm warning, with flash flooding likely in Melbourne\u2019s inner west.\n\nMetro Trains is already reporting that the subway at Ascot Vale station is inaccessible as it\u2019s full of water.\n\n\nUpdated at 4.51am GMT\n\n\n 4.40am  \n\nIn Estimates, the Australian government solicitor, Michael Kingston, has revealed fresh details of the public interest immunity claim that resulted in Afghanistan whistleblower David McBride withdrawing his Public Interest Disclosure Act defence.\nKingston said the claim was made by the Department of Defence way back in June 2021 but new correspondence on 18 October 2022 qualified the claim by identifying eight documents (two whole documents, and sections of six others) and asserting public-interest immunity over them.\nThe claim is designed to protect confidential information where disclosure would harm the public interest \u2013 such as security, defence or international relations of Australia and the proper functioning of a government.\nAdvocates are still pressuring the attorney general, Mark Dreyfus, to discontinue the prosecution.\nFor some background on this case:\n\n\nUpdated at 4.54am GMT\n\n\n 4.29am  \n\nMinister pays tribute to outgoing president of Fair Work Commission\nThe minister for employment and workplace relations, Tony Burke, has released a statement regarding the resignation of Justice Iain Ross from the Fair Work Commission, as we noted earlier. Burke describes him a \u201cman of great intellect and integrity\u201d, saying his tenure has been \u201coutstanding\u201d.\n\nHis commitment to fairness, decency and justice hasn\u2019t wavered in his ten years on the Commission.\nHis open and transparent approach has been an enormous asset \u2013 working in the interests of both workers and employers.\nJustice Ross has served governments on both sides of politics and he is held in high regard by all.\nHe\u2019s maintained the reputation of the Commission in the eyes of the public during turbulent times, particularly the lockdown period of the pandemic.\nThe Fair Work Commission is an institution the Australian people rely on and trust. As president, Justice Ross has cemented that trust.\n\nBurke also charges Ross with some responsibility for fruit pickers receiving a minimum hourly wage, the government\u2019s legislation for 10 days of family and domestic violence leave and other pay increases to workers.\n\nUpdated at 4.34am GMT\n\n\n 4.21am  \n\nKristy McBain, the minister for regional development, local government and territories has been speaking just now about flooding assistance, but there isn\u2019t very much new in there \u2013 she\u2019s just noting that a bunch of disaster payments have been made today and referring to the various other supports the government has put in place.\n\nUpdated at 4.37am GMT\n\n\n 4.14am  \n\nThere\u2019s a dixer to the assistant treasurer, Stephen Jones, about scams \u2013 which descends into an attack on the opposition:\nJones:\n\nYes we have a lot of work to do to protect people who have disadvantage and who are vulnerable to scams but it is not just them. From the highest of those in the country to the public in the regions, all have fallen victim to scams. Crypto scams, romance scams, investment scams, invoice-interception scams. This is a legacy that we have inherited.\nThe member for Deakin has had a fair bit to say throughout question time. He has just gone quiet. There is a very good reason that he has gone quiet. This issue is beyond politics. But it is not beyond incompetence and it is not beyond indifference. On his watch it doubled and then it doubled again. The member for Deakin had more people working on branch-stacking in his office. This is his legacy! This is his legacy! No wonder he had so much to say.\n\n\nUpdated at 4.27am GMT\n\n\n 4.06am  \n\nThere\u2019s some argy-bargy now about whether or not the PM is answering a question about gas prices. Peter Dutton claims he is not; Albanese claims he is.\nDutton:\n\nThe question was: prime minister, at your budget how much will gas prices go up by? Mr Speaker, he refuses to answer a basic question.\n\nAlbanese:\n\nI am certainly talking about gas which is what the question is about. Not the gas coming from those opposite. But the gas in the system that we need. And what we used to have was, we used to have questions of the minister...\n\nThere\u2019s commotion.\nAlbanese:\n\nHe\u2019s yelling. He is very angry, Mr Speaker.\n\n\nUpdated at 4.23am GMT\n\n\n 4.01am  \n\nThe prime minister, Anthony Albanese, has just finished speaking in response to a question about the government\u2019s desire to host the 2026 COP \u2013 despite Australia being \u201cone of the biggest fossil fuel exporters, with a further 114 new coal and gas projects in the pipeline.\u201d Will he now commit to not opening any new coal or gas projects?\nAlbanese:\n\nThe government will be implementing the plan that we took to the election, our Powering Australia plan and our plan to reduce emissions by 43% by 2030. Our plan to engage with our Pacific neighbours. At the Pacific Islands Forum, which the prime minister hosted in Fiji, it was clear to me that the entry card to get into discussions around the globe is action on climate change, is taking climate change seriously. The fact is that the communique from that summit, from the Pacific Islands Forum welcome the Australian government\u2019s new position, welcomed it.\n\nIt goes on much like this. No commitment, in other words.\n\nUpdated at 4.08am GMT\n\n\n 3.57am  \n\nLovely readers, this is Stephanie Convery \u2013 I\u2019m just jumping in unexpectedly because poor Amy Remeikis has lost internet at her house thanks to a big storm. Please bear with me while I attempt to catch up and with Amy while she tries to get back online!\n\nUpdated at 4.03am GMT\n\n\n 3.33am  \n\nIndependent MP Allegra Spender has one of the crossbench questions today and, like most of the crossbench questions, it\u2019s an actual question about policy.\n(It\u2019s still a surprise to hear someone ask something that matters beyond a political gotcha)\nAllegra Spender:\n\nA question for the prime minister. Do you agree that real effective wage rises in low-paid industries can be achieved through the awards as has been shown this week in the aged care awards, rather than through complex IR read legislation not taken to the election, delaying wage rises in protective negotiations?\n\nAnthony Albanese:\n\nI will start and ask the minister [for employment and workplace relations, Tony Bourke] to continue as well. I thank the member for Wentworth for her question and constructive engagement in this house. I think it is, though not credible to say to say that we did not take our policy to lift wages to the election.\nWe were very very clear, very very clear we would make clear that we would want to lift the wages and make submissions to those about those on minimum wage and the aged care workforce.\nWe were clear that we would make secure work an objective of the Fair Work Act. We were very clear that we would make gender-pay equity an objective of the Fair Work Act.\nOne of the things that is very clear on why we need to change the industrial relations system is that not only had real wages gone backwards over the previous decade, as a deliberate policy of the then-government, is that the feminised industries \u2013 people like our cleaners, our early learning educators, our aged care worker is, our disability care workers \u2013 have copped the brunt of the holding back of wages in this country.\nThat is why a fairer country deserves a fairer industrial relations system. That is what our secure work better pay bill will do. We believe there is a need to reform the system.\nThat was something we took and engaged very much with business and continue to do so, as well as with the unions.\nWe did so at the jobs and skills summit here. It is one of the challenges we need to meet and the Reserve Bank Governor made it clear that we need to lift wages, that it was something holding back the economy. And that is why our legislation is worthy of support by this parliament, because we believe very clearly we have a mandate for it\u2026\n\nTony Burke:\n\nI thank the member for Wentworth in the way she has engaged with this debate and the further conversations that are yet to happen. I do have to note as to why we do not just rely on the reward system \u2013 people with enterprise agreements [get paid] more and get more flexibility and productivity. They do provide a better outcome but are largely less available if you are a small business or medium-sized business unless available if it is a feminised workforce. If you deliver the pay rise in productivity, it is a much better outcome.\n\n\nUpdated at 4.57am GMT\n\n\n 3.28am  \n\nLiberal party deputy leader, Sussan Ley, has a prop (I think it is a front page) as she continues to find her groove as the opposition\u2019s attacker-in-chief and Milton Dick (who was once thrown out of question time for using muppets as a prop) immediately tells her to lose the paper.\nShe does not.\nLey:\n\nMy question is to the prime minister and I refer the prime minister to the front page of the Australian on May 2, 2022, entitled Life will be cheaper under me, when the prime minister says that Labor has lasting plans to cheaper mortgages and electricity and given they confirmed it will rise 55% and interest rates have gone up six times since the election, how can the prime minister seriously suggest that life is cheaper under Labor? Why won\u2019t he say sorry for yet another broken promise?\n\nDick is annoyed. Perhaps Ley could consider bringing in a muppet?\n\nI specifically asked you not to use a prop and if she does it again shall be asked to leave the house. I cannot be clearer than that. That goes to every member in the house.\n\nNice try! I give the call to the prime minister.\nAlbanese:\n\nThank you, Mr Speaker, I always read the front page of the Australian and I read the front page of every paper in the country to try to keep on top of where things are. A couple weeks later, in May, in May, the first interest rate increase occurred by the Reserve Bank and I thought they were in government at that point in time. But what we also know there was also scheduled to be an increase in energy prices, in wholesale prices, at the same time. But I didn\u2019t get to read about that on the front page of the Australian. I didn\u2019t get to read about it! I wonder why that is the case?\nBecause it was scheduled to occur, scheduled to occur, during the campaign, just like the interest-rate increase occurred during the campaign but when you know about one but we didn\u2019t know about the other one. When knew about one but not the other.\nAnd we do not know about the other because someone, someone...\nWho? Who was that! Someone, ... someone introduced, actually introduced a change in the law so that, so that people could not know that there was this wholesale price scheduled to occur.\nWhy would they do that?\nAnd what date did they pick?\nWhat date did they pick? Because election was on May 21 so did they pick the day before May 21 or after May 21? Hands up those who think they pick the day after? Hands up those who think they pick the day after? You are all correct. They pick the day after because they were not transparent. They were not transparent about what they had intended and what they had intended as a result of this...\n\n(Hands up never works well in this parliament)\nBefore the opposition can object, Albanese decides he has concluded his answer.\n\nUpdated at 3.44am GMT\n\n\n 3.21am  \nQuestion time begins\n\nPeter Dutton:\n\nMy question is to the prime minister. Last week I met with Louis and Tess who run a Cafe in Fairfield. They were promised that the Labor government would bring down power prices by $275 a year. They are facing a 56 per cent rise in power prices over the next two years and are forced to take measures like turning off the air conditioning to try and rein in surging costs. Will the prime minister apologise to families and businesses like the one Louis and Tess run for not delivering on his $275 commitment cut electricity prices?\n\nAnthony Albanese:\n\nI thank the leader of the opposition for his question. We stand by the evidence which is that renewables are the cheapest form of power. And the best way to get power prices down is to get renewables up. And that is exactly what this budget has done. Nearly $24 billion for clean energy investing in renewable energies, offshore wind, pumped hydro, community batteries and solar banks. All of it making up for a decade of neglect, a decade of denial, a decade of chaos.\nWe had on those opposite\u2019s watch four gigawatts leave the system and one gigawatt come in.\nThat is what occurred. From those opposite. Common sense tells you that with demand and supply, if you have less supply, but demand is going up then you will have pressure when it comes to prices.\nBut, of course, those opposite were too busy fighting for power amongst themselves to worry about generating power for the country. That is essentially the problem that occurred. That is essentially the problem that occurred. They had a rotation of ministers, they had every time that we had the potential of an energy policy being adopted, even ones that could\u2019ve adopted with bipartisan support, instead of adopting them they rolled the leader. That is what occurred. They were too busy worrying about their own power squabbles.\n\nPaul Fletcher steps in:\n\nMr Speaker on relevance. I ask that you follow in the tradition of Speaker Jenkins and direct the prime minister to make the material to the question at hand not some kind of historical explosion. He is looking for every reason to avoid answering the question.\n\nTony Burke counters:\n\nTo the point of order, this was hardly the type of question that went for the full 30 seconds available and asked what the impacts were on a cafe in Fairfield electricity prices. The prime minister is going to exactly why there is pressure on those families and those households and right now.\n\nDick says the PM is in order and we move on\n\nThank you very much Mr Speaker. Of course, what we know is that there are two big reasons why there are pressure on prices at the moment. One of which is I have outlined already, the failure of those opposite to actually build enough supply to generate power in the country, because they were too busy worried about power struggles within themselves. By the second of course, is \u2013 and this might be a news release for those opposite \u2013 the fact of the Russian invasion of Ukraine has led to global power prices rising that has occurred throughout the entire world. It seems oblivious to those opposite that this has occurred, but it is just a fact.\n\n\nUpdated at 3.36am GMT\n\n\n 3.17am  \nFair Work Commission boss retires\n\nThe head of the Fair Work Commission, Justice Iain Ross, has announced his retirement, effective 18 November.\nRoss, who has served 10 years and 8 months as president, was a federal court judge appointed to head the industrial tribunal during the Gillard government.\nIn a statement to FWC staff, Ross said:\n\n\u201cWe have recently concluded the review of modern awards; our digitalisation strategy is on track and we are meeting or exceeding all of our performance targets. Of course there is always more to be done. But at some point all things end. And for me, now is the right time. We are in good shape as an institution and are well placed to successfully implement any legislative change determined by parliament. Leaving now will mean that whoever is chosen as my successor will be fully involved in the implementation of those changes from the outset, rather than splitting that responsibility between myself and the next president. I think it is in the interests of the institution that there is continuity of leadership through the implementation of any legislative change.\u201d\n\nRoss\u2019 replacement will be one of the most significant appointments the Albanese government will make: with power over annual minimum wage reviews, award reviews and equal pay cases. The Fair Work Commission is an extremely powerful body, setting pay and conditions for millions of Australians.\nJust on Friday the FWC awarded a 15% pay increase to workers in the aged care sector.\n\n\nUpdated at 3.26am GMT\n\n\n 3.05am  \n\nAhead of question time is a condolence motion for the Liberal minister Tony Street.

That information seemed a bit unlikely since workers, suppliers etc would have been laid off, news that would have surfaced by now.)\nNow, Snowy isn\u2019t the most open of organisations, and that tradition seems to have continued in the wake of the resignation of Whitby\u2019s predecessor Paul Broad in late August. Perhaps ironically, Broad\u2019s exit followed issues over communication and transparency, Whitby said.\nAsked repeatedly by Senator Malcolm Roberts (who told estimates he too had worked underground; no comment) about how much 2.0 would cost, and when it would be completed, Whitby did eventually state the $5.9bn cost they had said previously remained the budget.\nParts of the work, though, were \u201c12 months behind program\u201d, Whitby conceded.\nThe work is no doubt challenging. The underground power plant is 800m below the surface and will require, he said, a cavern carved out that is 250m long, 80m high and 50m wide.\nDigging may yet accelerate (as is sometimes the case in such tunnelling). However, Snowy has not told the Australian Energy Market Operator formally of any delay (as AEMO confirmed to us today).\nThey still have December 2026 pencilled in for the commissioning of 2.0 - while adding \u201csensitivity\u201d forecasts that adjust supply projections just in case 2.0 is delayed (as is likely).\nMeanwhile, senators remain a bit sceptical about when the 750-megawatt Kurri Kurri gas plant might begin operation - and when it might be able to burn hydrogen and not just fossil gas. (Labor policy is for it to run entirely on hydrogen by 2030.)\nAnyway, Kurri Kurri is supposed to go online by the end of 2023. That\u2019s still the timetable even though flooding of the worksite has prompted construction delays. Snowy Hydro, though, continues to work towards a completion rate on time.\nWhich might be one stretch-target for whoever gets the formal CEO gig.\n\nUpdated at 3.20am GMT\n\n\n 2.46am  \n\nFlinders Liberal MP Zoe McKenzie says there will be no hold-up in passing the Respect@Work legislation through the parliament.\nShe told the ABC:\n\nThere was amendment on the floor of the house today, which likely goes to implementation, things like which is the proper body to investigate some kind of behaviour. There was a discussion about whether that should be the Fair Work Ombudsman or indeed the Human Rights Commission. I think there is broad support across the parliament for this change. A great piece of work done in the previous government, great work done by Kate Jenkins.\n\nJust a disagreement about the right organisation for investigations. Otherwise I think it will go through.\n\nUpdated at 2.54am GMT\n\n\n 2.26am  \n\nThings have been a little quiet this morning, which is usual for Monday.

That we have come this far as a society, and that\u2019s it.\nLet\u2019s make these changes and move forward with our national story.\nMr Speaker, we live in the greatest nation on earth.\nBut there is an even greater nation within our reach.\nThanks to the courage of every victim-survivor who stepped forward, we have no reason not to reach it.\nThey have shown the way.\nAnd it is something we should all embrace as part of the determination we share to shape Australia into the very best version it can be \u2013 a nation that reflects our highest ideals.\nI know that together we can build a better future, one with equality and respect at its core.\n\n\nUpdated at 2.24am GMT\n\n\n 2.15am  \n\nAnthony Albanese on introduction to parliament of the Kate Jenkins report\nThe remaining recommendations from Kate Jenkins\u2019 Respect at Work report which need legislation have been introduced to the parliament.\nThe PM has given a speech on the bill\u2019s introduction:\nThe bill will:\n\nPlace a positive duty on employers to take reasonable and proportionate measures to eliminate sex discrimination, sexual harassment and victimisation, as far as possible;\nGive the Australian Human Rights Commission new powers to enforce the positive duty, to help make sure employers are meeting their obligations;\nExpressly prohibit conduct that results in a hostile workplace environment on the basis of sex; and\nEnsure Commonwealth public sector organisations are also required to report to the Workplace Gender Equality Agency on its gender equality indicators.\n\nYou can read Katharine Murphy\u2019s preview of the report here:\n\n\nUpdated at 2.35am GMT\n\n\n 2.10am  \n\nRecord low grid demand but pain at the petrol pump\nWith a lot of wind and sun around yesterday and the generally mild temperatures on a Sunday, there was a good chance that the national electricity demand would drop to fresh lows.\nAnd voila: a record low for demand in the NEM - by more than 5%.\n\nWith more solar panels sprouting on rooftops by the day, it was also not a surprise that the share of renewable energy continues to creep higher. At the time of the record demand low, almost half the power was coming from rooftop PV, the Australian Energy Market Operator noted.\nContrast that with what awaits the motorist at the service station. Of late, petrol prices in many places have spiked above $2 a litre - with of course the end of the excise \u201choliday\u201d at the end of September adding about 25c/l. (Servos, though, were careful to phase back the increase.)\nWhat\u2019s also a factor is the fattening of the margin between wholesale and retail prices, according to the Australian Petroleum Institute. (Not great for CPI, either.)\n\nWith the next week looking dry for most of Australia most of the time (sorry Victoria, there\u2019s a bit more rain heading your way in a few days), more than a few people will be wondering why they don\u2019t have an electric vehicle powered by solar PV.\n\nUpdated at 2.17am GMT\n\n\n 2.09am  \n\nIR bill continued \u2026\nSo there have been some compromises. Tony Burke says:\nBut we\u2019ve been happy to listen to feedback about how to make sensible improvements to the practical application of the Bill. After additional consultations the Government has drafted a number of amendments we will move in the House this week, including:\n\nRequiring majority support from employees of each employer for a single interest bargaining stream authorisation;\nProvide that businesses and workers cannot be compelled into an authorisation or single interest employer agreement when they have agreed to bargain for a proposed single enterprise agreement, and a 6 month grace period where there is a history of effective bargaining;\nMaking further changes to the Better Off Overall Test to ensure new employees under an agreement are not left worse off;\nClarifying that the Fair Work Commission must be satisfied a minimum period of good-faith bargaining has occurred before moving to arbitrate;\nEstablish the Government\u2019s promised new National Construction Industry Forum as a statutory advisory body;\nGiving business 12 months to adjust to changes to fixed-term contracts.\n\n\nUpdated at 2.15am GMT\n\n\n 2.08am  \n\nTony Burke has released a statement on the IR bill\n\nThe Albanese Labor Government will adopt a range of amendments to the Secure Jobs, Better Pay Bill after a week of constructive consultations with business groups, unions and experts.\nThis bill is essential and urgent. It will promote job security, help close the gender pay gap, modernise the workplace bargaining system and get wages moving after a decade of stagnation.\nAustralians are struggling with the rising cost of living. Their wages are not keeping up with prices, and it\u2019s clear the Government has to intervene to increase access to bargaining and close the loopholes undermining wage growth.\nThe Government made a clear commitment to the Australian people at the election to get wages moving.\nThat won\u2019t happen automatically. To get wages moving we need to modernise our workplace laws.\nOne of the Government\u2019s top priorities is to fix the ailing bargaining system and get more people on to enterprise agreements.\nWorkers on agreements benefit from better pay and conditions \u2013 and employers on agreements benefit from better productivity. But today only 14.7 per cent of workers are on in-date agreements.

In fact, paying could have the opposite effect and encourage the criminal to directly extort our customers, and there is a strong chance that paying puts more people in harm\u2019s way by making Australia a bigger target.\nIt is for these reasons we have decided we will not pay a ransom for this event.\n\nThis decision is consistent with the position of the Australian government.\n\n\nUpdated at 11.32pm GMT\n\n\n 9.41pm  \nMedibank will not pay ransom to hackers\n\nMedibank have made another announcement to the ASX confirming they will not pay the ransom hackers have demanded not to release information from its data breach.\n\nUpdated at 9.44pm GMT\n\n\n 9.27pm  \n\nMultiple bills to be debated heading into Senate\u2019s final two weeks\nIt\u2019s going to be a big week in the house \u2013 the Respect@Work legislation is set to be introduced today with the privacy changes in response to the data breaches to be introduced tomorrow. Which leaves IR for Wednesday and Thursday.\nAs a blog watcher pointed out, that puts those bills in the Senate for the next two weeks (the Senate\u2019s final two weeks).\nThat leaves the National Anti-Corruption Commission bill. The report into that is due to be tabled on Thursday which means we won\u2019t see it debated this week. So it looks like a big final fortnight of sittings.\nThere is still talk \u2013 and it\u2019s just talk \u2013 of the Senate sitting for an additional week in early December if it doesn\u2019t get through everything. Some in the Coalition see that as just a threat to rush through legislation. Others on the crossbench see it as necessary to properly review everything. But we\u2019ll see whether it happens or not soon.\n\nUpdated at 9.33pm GMT\n\n\n 9.13pm  \n\nSecond shipment of monkeypox vaccines arrive in Australia\nThe second shipment of the monkeypox vaccine, Jynneos has made it to Australia and will be distributed to the states and territories.

So we need to sort that out. But there is an issue here around the visa processing system and that might sound I\u2019m sure bureaucratic and boring to people out there, but \u2026 when we arrived in government, there were a million problems.\n\n\n\nUpdated at 11.35pm GMT\n\n\n 8.45pm  \n\nConcerns raised over flaw in Labor\u2019s Respect@Work bill\nLawyers, academics and advocates have raised concerns that the Albanese government\u2019s Respect@Work legislation contains a flaw that could \u201cundermine access to justice\u201d.\nThe bill, which is expected to pass the House of Representatives this week, \u201cwill go a significant way to strengthening legal protections against workplace sexual harassment\u201d, according to a joint letter to the attorney general, Mark Dreyfus, and the minister for women, Katy Gallagher.\nBut the signatories \u2013 including the 2015 Australian of the Year, Rosie Batty, and Prof Michelle Ryan, director of the Global Institute for Women\u2019s Leadership at the ANU \u2013 have raised \u201cdeep concern at the proposed amendments to the costs provisions in the Australian Human Rights Commission Act 1986\u201d.\nMaurice Blackburn Lawyers and other signatories say the bill proposes a costs neutrality model, whereby litigants bear their own costs unless the court orders otherwise. (The court may make orders as to costs as they consider \u201cjust\u201d where \u201cthere are circumstances that justify it in doing so\u201d.)\nThe letter explains:\nWhile superficially the arrangement represents an improvement on the status quo, its design and uncertainty around its operation will in fact serve to undermine access to justice. The proposed model will ultimately make it harder for targets of sexual harassment to vindicate their legal rights; it will deter women from pursuing cases and reduce the compensation that they will achieve if they do proceed.\nTaking a costs neutrality approach to a relationship that is characterised by endemic inequality only serves to entrench that inequality. The proposed approach will also make it uneconomical for law firms to offer no-win, no-fee arrangements in discrimination matters and make it unviable to bring class actions against employers.\nWe urge you to amend the Bill to include an \u201cequal access\u201d asymmetrical costs model. Such an approach would protect a complainant from an adverse costs order, unless they have acted vexatiously or unreasonably, but enable them to recover costs should they succeed. This model would recognise the significant inequality in resources between complainants in sexual harassment matters and their employers. It would also underscore the wider public interest in those who have been sexually harassed vindicating their legal rights.\nOther signatories to the letter include Shine Lawyers, Grata Fund, Public Interest Advocacy Centre, Australian Council of Trade Unions, and Australian Women Lawyers Ltd.\n\nUpdated at 8.54pm GMT\n\n\n 8.45pm  \nGood morning\n\nWelcome back to parliament.\nThere are only three scheduled house sitting weeks left \u2013 and just eight days for the Senate, which will spend this week in budget estimates.\nSo no legislation is getting passed this week. But that doesn\u2019t mean we aren\u2019t going to see some legislative fights.\nTony Burke and the government really want to see the IR bill get through the parliament and have set a very tight timeline to make it happen. So far Burke has compromised on a couple of sticking points \u2013 including changing multi-employer bargaining from a majority across the sector to a majority in each business. There is also potential for the government to move on the introduction of the changes, with talk of a six-month grace period in the works.\nBut the government will have to spend this week trying to win over a Senate crossbencher or two. Jacqui Lambie and David Pocock are the two most likely and so far neither are budging.\nMeanwhile, Labor senators will find themselves on the other side of the table this week as Senate estimates gets under way in earnest. The Coalition are intent in poking holes in the budget and in particular anything to do with the cost of living, so that\u2019s going to be a long week for some of the Labor ministers.\nAnd it\u2019s all playing out in the shadow of the 27th Cop, being held in Egypt. Anthony Albanese isn\u2019t there \u2013 Chris Bowen is.\nAustralia doesn\u2019t have much new to say, but Adam Morton will be covering what the meeting decides \u2013 as well as poking into some of the schemes meant to improve Australia\u2019s position.\n\nYou have Katharine Murphy, Sarah Martin, Paul Karp, Josh Butler and Daniel Hurst watching all the happenings in Parliament House for you and the entire Guardian brains trust watching what\u2019s happening outside of Canberra.\nAmy Remeikis is with you on the blog for most of the day.\nReady? It\u2019s a three coffee day minimum. Hope you have yours.\nLet\u2019s get into it.\n\nUpdated at 9.13pm GMT\n"

                    "body": "As the takeover of the club goes on, Chelsea exist in a curious netherworld, both Roman Abramovich\u2019s club and not. Whatever promises the shortlist of prospective new owners may make now, nobody can be sure what sort of future Chelsea are facing \u2013 although fans can be relatively certain whoever comes in will not be pumping in the sort of money Abramovich did. The dream of a third Champions League came to an end on Tuesday, but the lesser prize of the FA Cup remains in reach. Should Chelsea lose to Crystal Palace in Sunday\u2019s semi-final, though, their season will in effect be over. There will be no glorious farewell to the oligarch \u2013 or, perhaps more appositely, to the good times he brought to Stamford Bridge. With nothing left to play for, there will have to be acceptance and then perhaps some idea of the future may begin to emerge. Reality will begin to bite. The Abramovich era began in August 2003 with a 2-0 Champions League qualifying playoff win away to MSK Zilina in the mountains of northern Slovakia. A precise endpoint is harder to locate. Symbolically, perhaps, the end came with the 2-1 win over Palmeiras in the Club World Cup final in Abu Dhabi. It completed the set of possible trophies and that it was won in the United Arab Emirates, whose interest in football only became apparent in the era heralded by Abramovich, felt highly appropriate.  The last match before Abramovich offered to hand the club over to its trustees was the 2-0 home Champions League win over Lille, and the last game before sanctions were imposed a 4-0 Premier League win at Burnley. The last game before a new owner takes charge will almost certainly be a Premier League fixture against Watford at Stamford Bridge. The FA Cup final, a week earlier, would represent a more dramatic finale. Football may already have felt hideously commercial when Abramovich arrived, but it had been only seven years since countries had been permitted more than one Champions League entrant (plus the previous season\u2019s winners, if different). The impact of the advent of the Champions League and the Premier League a decade earlier was just beginning to be felt. Porto beat Monaco in the final that season; one team from Portugal or France have reached the final since. The process of turning the competition into a rich man\u2019s pass-the-parcel had begun but was by no means as advanced as it is today \u2013 but still the superclubs want the additional security of places based on historical performance. Nobody then had heard of the term \u201csportswashing\u201d. Nobody had any real sense of why foreign money would want to invest in football. There may have been some notion Abramovich, by giving himself a profile outside Russia, was protecting himself, but the general feeling was that he was a rich man who had bought himself a new toy.  Rampant commercialism, of which the Champions League and Premier League were central pillars, and the growth in broadcast rights, were changing the landscape. The rich would have got richer and football would have been facing the consequences of that. But what Abramovich did was in effect decouple a club\u2019s capacity to invest from success on the pitch and the usual rules of commerce. Arsenal built a new stadium to try to compete with Manchester United; Abramovich just put his hand in his pocket. The \u00a31.5bn in loans, which it seems will not be paid off, is what Ars\u00e8ne Wenger meant when he referred to financial doping. Where Chelsea led, Manchester City, Paris Saint-Germain and Newcastle have followed (for all that the incredible achievements of City\u2019s commercial department in making their club the richest by revenue in the world are to be saluted). By definition, if new owners are motivated by profit they will not be so generous. Chelsea led football into that new age. Now they will have to face living in it without their benefactor. For the first few weeks, the crisis in ownership seemed to pull the squad together. They won 12 out of 13 games, the exception being the penalty shootout defeat to Liverpool in the Carabao Cup final. But then came the defeats to Brentford and Real Madrid, seven goals conceded in 90 minutes of playing time. To an extent that was freakish: five of those goals were the result of brilliant finishes. But, as Thomas Tuchel acknowledged, Chelsea\u2019s pressing had collapsed; they were more open, easier to play through, than at any previous point in his reign. He got a response away at Southampton and in the second leg in Madrid. Perhaps the defeats were just a blip. But Tuchel\u2019s downbeat response after the first leg suggested he feared something deeper. If Chelsea lose on Sunday, there is a danger their players will glance down and suddenly realise they have run out of cliff. If there is nothing left to play for, no end goal to focus on, players can not be blamed if thoughts drift to their own futures.  There is plenty of uncertainty about. Antonio R\u00fcdiger and Andreas Christensen are out of contract. C\u00e9sar Azpilicueta has triggered a one-year contract extension but continues to be linked to Barcelona. Jorginho, N\u2019Golo Kant\u00e9 and Marcos Alonso, all the wrong side of 30, have deals that expire in 2023. So does Ross Barkley. How do you begin to decide on new deals or potential replacements when nobody knows who will be in charge or even when new transfers will be possible?  Of course players will wonder whether they fit the plans of a new owner, thirtysomethings will be attracted by the security of a two- or three-year deal elsewhere, most will investigate alternatives or contingencies. Once that happens, getting them to commit to demanding pressing structures could become very difficult. The Abramovich era will have half a dozen endpoints, but a defeat to Palace would be the one that says definitively it is over, that there are no more trophies to come, just the memories of some extraordinary football and silverware. All that will remain is doubt, some great memories and a highly corrosive legacy."

                    "body": "For years, racing has wondered what it will do without Frankie Dettori, who took over from Lester Piggott as the sport\u2019s greatest headline-grabber and has now held the mantle for more than three decades. In a little less than 11 months\u2019 time we will finally find out, after Dettori\u2019s disclosure to ITV Racing on Saturday that the 2023 Flat season will be his final campaign in the saddle.\nDettori, as he always intended, will bow out at the top, probably on 4 November 2023 at the Breeders\u2019 Cup meeting at Santa Anita, the track where he steered Raven\u2019s Pass to the first \u2013 and still only \u2013 success for a British-trained runner in the Breeders\u2019 Cup Classic.\n\nThat is just one among dozens of highlights on Dettori\u2019s showreel, which opens with a big-race double at Ascot in September 1990, when he was three months shy of his 20th birthday, and includes the unforgettable afternoon at the same track in 1996 when he went straight through the seven-race card. Dubai Millennium, Swain, Ouija Board, Fantastic Light, Golden Horn, Enable and Stradivarius are just a handful of the champions that earned their place in the pantheon with Dettori holding the reins.\n\u201cIt is a very difficult decision because my heart wants to carry on riding,\u201d Dettori said. \u201cBut I have had to use my brain and I\u2019ve just turned 52 and next year I\u2019ll be 53. I want to be competitive enough to do my owners and my horses justice next year and I think I\u2019m still in that bracket of being good. It was difficult, but it is the right time.\n\u201cI spoke to my dad [the former Italian champion Gianfranco] at length. My dad stopped at 51, he is very supporting and I also had to speak to my wife and children, who are delighted because they have barely seen me for 35 years.\n\u201cI\u2019ve decided with the firepower I have next year, I can finish my career on a big note. Fingers crossed, I stay in one piece and we\u2019ll give it a good go next year. Look at Ronaldo, one day he was playing and he\u2019s on the bench the next. I don\u2019t want to end up like that and end up where I\u2019m struggling to get rides in the big races. At the moment I still have good horses to ride and I want to finish like that.\u201d\n\nFrom his earliest days as a teenaged apprentice \u2013 and the first fledgling rider since Piggott to ride 100 winners in a season \u2013 horses have always run for Dettori. His immense natural talent and horsemanship found an ideal foil in the trainer Luca Cumani, who steered him through some difficult early years in Newmarket dealing with his celebrity status, which included a caution for possession of cocaine in April 1993.\n\nThe following year, he teamed up with Sheikh Mohammed\u2019s embryonic Godolphin operation, at the start of a 20-year run of almost unbroken success on the track in their royal blue silks. The first of his three Flat jockeys\u2019 championships arrived the same year, when his final total of 233 winners was the highest for 45 years.\nThe nadir of Dettori\u2019s two decades with Godolphin was the plane crash in June 2000 which claimed the life of his pilot, Patrick Mackey. He was pulled from the burning wreckage by his fellow rider Ray Cochrane, and returned to the saddle only two months later.\nBy then, Dettori was already firmly established as one of the sporting world\u2019s most familiar names, thanks in part to his magnificent seven at Ascot in 1996 but also his natural ebullience in front of the cameras. Where Piggott, his predecessor as the betting public\u2019s go-to jockey, shied away from interviews and microphones, Dettori embraced celebrity easily and instinctively, reaching new audiences via shows as varied as A Question Of Sport and Loose Women.\nDettori was, in his later years, a flawed hero too, forced to rebuild his career in the post-Godolphin days after a six-month ban for testing positive for cocaine in September 2012. He checked in to the Celebrity Big Brother house while serving his suspension, then returned to his day job in May 2013 with his talent undimmed but a host of young and hungry rivals ahead of him in many trainers\u2019 pecking orders.\nThe 10 seasons since have seen Dettori enjoy an Indian summer in association with John Gosden\u2019s powerhouse yard in Newmarket. A typically brilliant ride from a wide draw aboard Golden Horn in the 2015 Prix de l\u2019Arc de Triomphe further cemented his status as one of the few individuals in any sport for whom no surname is required, while Enable and Stradivarius ran up long sequences of wins in Group One events.\nDettori\u2019s 11-month farewell tour will give his public every chance to say goodbye and will no doubt be emotional at times, with his last Guineas meeting, last Derby and last Royal Ascot all leading towards a final wave to the fans at the Breeders\u2019 Cup in California.\nThe last of his 14 winners at the meeting \u2013 a record for a European-based rider \u2013 came in 2018, but who would bet against one last flying dismount by Dettori against the backdrop of the San Gabriel mountains in November?"

                    "body": "The television in the club house at Coalville Town was tuned into BBC2 and all eyes were on Alan Smith and Dion Dublin as they prepared to make the draw for the first round of the FA Cup. \u201cWe were No 61 and Charlton were No 11,\u201d says Jake Eggleton, recalling that Monday night last month. \u201cWhen No 11 came out and we waited to see who\u2019d they play, all I could think was: \u2018Let it be 61, it\u2019s got to be 61.\u2019 When it was us, the whole place went mental. It was a wow moment. It felt fantastic, unbelievable, amazing.\u201d As a lifelong Charlton fan, the Coalville defender had even more reason than most to celebrate a draw which will transport his seventh-tier, Leicestershire-based team to The Valley on Saturday. \u201cAfter the draw my mum said she just knew we\u2019d get Charlton,\u201d says Eggleton. \u201cShe said she just felt it was meant to be. But it also means that, for the first time, she and dad are going to be in the away end at The Valley.\u201d  As a boy growing up in north Kent, Eggleton, now 24, belonged to a family of Charlton season-ticket holders and was part of the club\u2019s academy until his release at the age of eight. \u201cBut I kept my season ticket,\u201d he says. \u201cEven now, I\u2019m still a massive fan. Charlton\u2019s is the first result I look out for and I go and watch them whenever I can. If they\u2019re playing in the Midlands and Coalville haven\u2019t got a game, I\u2019ll be there.\u201d A boy who grew up idolising two Charlton strikers, first Darren Bent and then Yann Kermorgant, soon moved on to West Ham, doing so well that on 2 May 2015 he walked on to the Upton Park pitch at half time in a Premier League win against Burnley to sign a scholarship contract. One of the fellow academy prodigies next to Eggleton in photographs commemorating that landmark afternoon was Declan Rice. \u201cI played alongside Declan in the Under-18s,\u201d says Eggleton, who would be released by the club two years later. \u201cI haven\u2019t kept in touch with him so much but I\u2019ve still got friends at West Ham.  \u201cBeing there was a really good experience. I had a fantastic time, so leaving was hard. It had been a big part of my life for 10 years and, for a while, not being at West Ham any more was very difficult. For a period of about a year I fell out of love with football.\u201d After stints with non-league Hendon and then Hampton and Richmond Borough he began preparing for an alternative career and headed to Loughborough University, completing a degree in sport and exercise science this summer before immediately embarking on a Masters in strength and conditioning. \u201cSports science gives you a lot of options, both within football and outside it,\u201d says Eggleton. \u201cComing to Loughborough was one of the best decisions I\u2019ve made.\u201d During that initial degree course he started playing for the university\u2019s first XI and the qualities that had propelled him to Under-21 level at West Ham soon ensured he swiftly caught the eye of local scouts. \u201cWe played Coalville in pre-season and afterwards the manager [Adam Stevens] asked me if I\u2019d like to sign for him and I\u2019ve been here ever since,\u201d says the centre-back who is also comfortable at right-back. \u201cIt\u2019s been really good. There\u2019s a great sense of community. After games, we all go and have a few drinks with the supporters in the club house. It\u2019s been really nice to be able to get to know them.\u201d Semi-professional Coalville are one of several teams pushing for promotion from the Southern League Premier Division Central but a team who train two evenings a week emphasised their potential by winning 3-2 at fifth-tier Notts County in the fourth qualifying round last month.  The reward was a trip to League One Charlton where about 2,000 Ravens fans \u2013 Coalville\u2019s nickname derives from their origin in 1926 as Ravenstone Miners\u2019 Athletic \u2013 are expected to congregate at The Valley for their side\u2019s first appearance in the first round for 18 years. In November 2004, Coalville were widely regarded as somewhat unlucky to lose at Wycombe but Eggleton is not alone in believing that Saturday\u2019s tie against a former Premier League side at a famous 27,000-capacity stadium represents a somewhat bigger deal. There is also the reality that a defender cheered on by a sizeable contingent of family and friends will be back in the shop window. \u201cIf I got an opportunity to play professionally I\u2019d definitely give it a go,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I\u2019m not thinking about that at the moment. I just want to make the very most of Saturday\u2019s opportunity. \u201cI want to be sure I take it all in \u2026 and do my best to help Coalville play as well as we know we can. It\u2019s going to be really exciting.\u201d"

                    "body": "With Sunday\u2019s Canadian Grand Prix the final fly-away meeting of the spring, Formula One is about to enter its European leg proper. But the sport\u2019s very popularity may now be putting at risk some of those classic races in what used to be considered F1\u2019s heartland. Following the money as ever, F1 is signing more expensive and longer deals with circuits. But given there are a finite number of slots available on the calendar, something has to give.  This past week, the F1 CEO, Stefano Domenicali, travelled to meet the organisers of a proposed South African Grand Prix at the Kyalami circuit. No official word has been made but there is clear expectation that South Africa will be added to the calendar in 2023. It will be a welcome return, with F1 having not held a meeting in Africa since Kyalami hosted its last GP in 1993 and with drivers including Lewis Hamilton expressing a firm belief the sport should have a presence in Africa. On Thursday, F1 said it had signed a new deal for the Australian GP to be hosted at Melbourne until 2035, a 10-year extension on their current contract to 2025. It is the second-longest deal after F1\u2019s recent contract with Bahrain that extends until 2036 and is indicative of the type of business F1 is now concluding. A contract with Saudi Arabia is worth a reported \u00a350m per meeting for more than a decade. Qatar will begin its 10-year deal next season, having paid similar money. At the end of last year, Abu Dhabi renewed its contract until the end of the decade, while Miami\u2019s debut this year was its first in a 10-year deal. The surge in interest in F1 is one the sport\u2019s owners welcome but it comes at a cost. The maximum number of meetings that can be held under the commercial agreement with the teams is 25 and next year is already shaping up to surpass that. With 22 races this season \u2013 and Las Vegas, Qatar, South Africa and a return for China, if Covid regulations allow, all set for next year \u2013 at least one race has to go. Clearly F1 will not be considering dropping those big-money, long-term deals. Monaco, France and now even the Belgian GP at Spa are vulnerable. Race rotation \u2013 a circuit hosting a grand prix every other year \u2013 will be employed. The Belgian GP, which has featured in 66 years of the F1 world championship since it began in 1950, may now have to accept it cannot compete with the sport\u2019s financial demands. There is also concern at the facilities and infrastructure in Spa, as demonstrated last year when the heavy rain that scuppered the race left fans stranded with their cars stuck in muddy fields surrounding the circuit.  Monaco has been bullish it will remain a permanent feature on the calendar but even that race cannot consider its position sacrosanct. Since F1\u2019s owner, Liberty Media, has expanded the sport, particularly in North America, Monaco\u2019s place as a glamour meeting that sells the sport is no longer of great import and discussions with the organisers grind on, a far cry from the preferential treatment the race received under Bernie Ecclestone\u2019s regime. Conversely, it is believed the French GP at Paul Ricard would be open to becoming a biennial event and it is understood that Spa and France are in the running to be dropped next year. That they may become rotational meetings is indicative of the booming sport\u2019s clear ambition. Only a year ago some team principals were expressing the desire to set the season at 20 races, fearing for the toll on their personnel, especially with a relentless run of double- and triple-headers. After Canada, 13 races remain and all are either double- or triple-headers. There has also been disquiet that the sheer volume of races was diluting their impact and value. Senior figures have expressed concern that it is hard to sell a grand prix as special when they come thick and fast.  Last year, McLaren\u2019s CEO, Zak Brown, made the case for a core of 15 races, with a further 10 rotating in and out of the calendar; five one year, five the next, in a 20-race season. His plan seems hopelessly out of step with what F1 is aiming for. While Domenicali has made the case for 23 races being the optimum, the indications from what is being planned for next year are that F1 is heading toward a 24- or 25-race season. Race-hosting fees are one of the three biggest sources of income, along with TV rights and marketing, and with the global economy in a precarious position, locked-in fees are a stable source of income the sport wants to embrace. Many of Europe\u2019s venues may well maintain their place on the calendar but only as part of what will turn into an immense, gruelling season."

                    "body": "Rangers take on Eintracht Frankfurt in the Europa League final on Wednesday, an extraordinary achievement for a club in administration 10 years ago. This chance of glory is particularly remarkable given Rangers have triumphed in Europe on one previous occasion. Fifty years ago this month, they lifted the European Cup Winners\u2019 Cup in Barcelona after the most torrid, draining \u2013 and violent \u2013 football match I have attended. I fervently hope victory can be repeated but not, I pray, in similar circumstances.  In 1972, Rangers had been suffering a trophy drought that had lasted years with our great rivals, Celtic, managed by Jock Stein, monopolising Scotland\u2019s football silverware. As a young Rangers fan, I was to experience a great deal of disappointment. Europe offered a lifeline, however, and that season the team \u2013 managed by Willie Waddell \u2013 began a dramatic journey across the continent, albeit on an unorthodox route. Having dispatched Rennes in the first round, Rangers beat Sporting Lisbon 3-2 at Ibrox but lost by the same score in Portugal. In extra time each team scored another goal. Rangers should have progressed: away goals then counted double in the event of a tie, a rule that was bizarrely ignored by the Dutch referee Laurens van Ravens, who ordered a penalty shootout \u2013 which we lost. A purple-faced Waddell protested and Uefa officials backed down and awarded the tie to Rangers. Torino were beaten next, before Rangers took on Bayern Munich in the semi-final, drawing 1-1 in Germany before winning 2-0 at Ibrox against a squad that included Franz Beckenbauer and Gerd M\u00fcller. Now it was our turn to party. On 24 May, I flew to Barcelona with my friend Jan de Vries. We eschewed the delights of the Sagrada and the Palace of Catalan Music and chose instead to experience the city\u2019s cafe culture, swilling sangria in the mistaken belief it was mostly made of fruit juice and a dash of vermouth. In fact it was low on vitamin C and high on wine and brandy \u2013 which may explain a certain light-headedness we experienced as we headed to Camp Nou. Nor were we the only ones in that condition. On the other hand, we had no worries about rival fans. We were playing Dynamo Moscow in an era of Soviet travel bans. So Jan and I \u2013 along with the 20,000 Rangers fans who also made it to Camp Nou \u2013 had the stadium to ourselves. We posed for touchline photographs as the police looked on unconcerned. Rangers started the match at a pulsating pace. Colin Stein and then Willie Johnston scored. Then, minutes into the second half, goalkeeper Peter McCloy\u2019s massive punt upfield evaded the Moscow defence and Johnston smashed the ball hard and low past Vladimir Pilguy in the Dynamo goal.  Bedlam erupted. Jan picked me up and threw me into the air: a neat trick given that I am six foot tall, beefy and was also full of sangria. Three up \u2013 there was no way we could lose now. Dynamo began their fightback. Vladimir Eshtrekov scored; Dave Smith cleared the ball off our goalline; and with full time looming Aleksandr Mahovikov got a second. Our hold on the cup was hanging by a bootlace. Minutes later, the referee blew his whistle for a foul and thousands of fans invaded the pitch thinking the match was over. The pitch was cleared, the match restarted and eventually the final whistle was blown. Jubilant fans poured back on to the pitch, only to be assailed by rattled, baton-wielding police who had previously ignored our antics. Fans regrouped and fought back and as a full-scale battle unfolded Jan and I hurriedly left the stadium. By the time we reached Barcelona airport, check-in desks were surrounded by fans clutching bloody head wounds, purple bruises and torn clothes. Views about the religious persuasions of Spanish policemen were the main topic of conversation on the flight home. For the Rangers team there was no lap of honour and no showing off the cup at Camp Nou. The trophy was instead slipped to the captain, John Greig, in a backroom and he carried it home in his luggage. We got our first view of the trophy the following evening when Rangers, sporting the cup, toured Ibrox on the back of an old coal lorry that had been festooned with blue, red and white regalia.  Rangers were given a two-year European ban \u2013 later reduced to one year \u2013 because of their fans\u2019 behaviour. Was it deserved? Well, there was certainly some drunkenness but when we arrived the atmosphere in the city had been a happy carnival one. And there were no pitched battles with rival fans because there were none there to fight with. It was the sudden, panic-stricken actions of the police that was the main cause of the battle and that certainly did not justify a ban that meant Rangers could not defend the trophy they had played their hearts out to win. So yes, here is hoping for a similar result in Seville on Wednesday \u2013 but please let it be achieved in calmer conditions. Steering clear of the sangria might be a good start."

                    "body": "  9.42pm    Nick Ames was at London Road this evening, and his report has landed. Click below for that. Thanks for reading this MBM. Nighty night!      9.29pm    Pep talks to ITV. \u201cExcept for the first six minutes of the second half, the rest was really good. We know the quality Riyad has, and the thing I am most proud of is that he loves to play football. It is not a profession for him, it is a joy, and he has incredible quality up front. Jack Grealish played really well, and it\u2019s important he came back for the injury.\u201d He\u2019s then asked about a possible treble, and flatly refuses to get involved in any such discussion. And who can blame him?     9.23pm    Grant McCann, Posh and proud. \u201cI\u2019m really proud of the performance. We had to be good defensively, and we were well organised. We had some good moments in transition. We had a massive chance to go 1-0 up, and on another day we would, but against top teams they keep probing. That\u2019s a benchmark now, there\u2019s good quality in this changing room, and it\u2019s up to myself and my staff to get it out of them on a more regular basis.\u201d     9.13pm    A cheerful Jack Grealish talks to ITV. \u201cWe had most of the chances. We had a lot of the ball, but we\u2019ve had a lot of teams sitting in against us recently. It\u2019s something we\u2019ve got used to. We finally broke Everton down, and we did the same thing tonight. You know what was funny? I sat next to Phil Foden on the coach here, and was scrolling through Twitter, and a video of Messi\u2019s passing come up, and we were just watching. And as soon as Phil hits that pass, I score and when we were celebrating, he comes over to me and says: just like what we were watching before the game! Just like Messi, his pass!\u201d He also praises Oleksandr Zinchenko for his performance in these trying times.   Updated at 11.02pm GMT    9.05pm   FULL TIME: Peterborough United 0-2 Manchester City  Foden bullets a header over from 12 yards, and that\u2019s the final whistle. City are the first ball into the velvet bag for the sixth-round draw. They weren\u2019t at their best, but eventually scored two wonderful goals. Peterborough made the champions of England work for the win, and can be proud of their performance tonight. More of that, and Championship survival isn\u2019t beyond them.   Updated at 10.09pm GMT    9.02pm    90 min: Stones heads across the face of goal, left to right, teeing up his partner Laporte, six yards out. Laporte somehow flicks the ball wide right. A farcical miss here, not that it matters.     9.01pm    89 min: Grealish has a go from a tight angle on the left. Benda, who has performed very well after that comically nervous clearance after 70 seconds, tips over brilliantly. That\u2019s an excellent save.     9.00pm    88 min: On ITV, Lee Dixon names Jeando Fuchs of Peterborough as his player of the match. That\u2019s a fine choice, the Cameroonian midfielder has been here, there and everywhere, and as Dixon (a City fan) says, giving it to a City player would have been boring. Fuchs certainly deserves it on his own terms.     8.58pm    86 min: City continue to probe but not with any great intent.     8.57pm    84 min: Brown launches long down the middle in the hope of releasing Marriott. Marriott doesn\u2019t have the momentum to beat Laporte, who eases him off the ball. A shame for Posh that Jones wasn\u2019t still on the pitch to take advantage of that situation.     8.55pm    83 min: Signs that both teams would declare now if that was an option.     8.53pm    81 min: City continue to press. The ball pinballs around the Peterborough box, but doesn\u2019t quite fall for either Foden or Mahrez. It\u2019s eventually shuttled clear. But City come again, and Grealish is clipped by Fuchs, just to the left of the Posh D. A free kick in a dangerous position coming up.     8.50pm    79 min: Another couple of Posh changes. Burrows and Mumba come on for Ward and Coulson.     8.49pm    77 min: Cancelo has a whack. Blocked. Gundogan dribbles into the box from the right. He aims, like Mahrez for the opener, towards the bottom left. That one\u2019s blocked as well. City scent a third.     8.48pm    75 min: City stroke it around a bit, just because they can. \u201cLike City, the Posh had their own fly on the wall documentary back in the late 90\u2019s naturally titled There\u2019s Only One Barry Fry,\u201d writes Ian Burch. \u201cIt follows Barry as he takes over the club as Chairman and Manager promising to take them out of the then Div 2. A man of his word, Barry duly takes them straight down to Div 3. Along the way we get to see Barry effing and jeffing at his players and almost coming to blows with some of them. We also witness Barry in his office where every day is transfer deadline day as he wheels and deals, banging his gavel on his desk at the conclusion of a transfer like Leonard Sachs introducing someone like Roy Castle on The Good Old Days.\u201d     8.46pm    73 min: Peterborough could be forgiven for feeling deflated, having battled hard for so long, only to concede a quick one-two that has surely put the game out of their reach. But they continue to run, press and harry, and their fans are still giving it plenty. A great FA Cup atmosphere.     8.44pm    71 min: Posh make a triple change, replacing Jones, Szmodics and Poku with Clarke-Harris, Brown and Marriott. The latter is quickly involved, sending a rasping shot towards the top right and forcing Ederson into his first serious save of the evening. He parries strongly.     8.43pm    69 min: Knight nutmegs Mahrez out on the right. Huge cheers. The move fizzles out, and then the whistle goes, Szmodics having thrown Fernandinho to the floor during a penalty-box wrestling match. Both men are booked, Fernandinho unluckily so, having done very little, Szmodics having briefly lost his head and instigating the entire thing.   Updated at 11.09pm GMT    8.40pm   GOAL! Peterborough United 0-2 Manchester City (Grealish 67)  Foden, just to the right of the centre circle, sprays a glorious pass towards Grealish, on the left-hand edge of the Posh D. Grealish stuns the ball with one velvet touch, moves a little to the left to see off the nearby Knight, and slots into the bottom left. Benda once again had no chance. Who knew long-ball football could be so pretty?    Updated at 9.11pm GMT    8.38pm    65 min: Poku is sent scampering clear into the City box down the right ... but only because Ward had clattered into Laporte during the build-up to make space. The whistle goes for a free kick.     8.37pm    64 min: ... or was it a brilliant bit of defending by Knight? Yep. Replays show the Posh defender got across and stuck out a desperate boot, Mahrez\u2019s shot pinging off his toe and over. What a challenge! No corner, though.     8.35pm    63 min: It should be two. Jones dribbles down the Posh left but his low cross is cleared. City break. Grealish releases Mahrez down the inside right. Mahrez enters the box ... but sends his shot sailing over the bar with only the keeper to beat.      8.34pm    62 min: That was some goal by Mahrez, who has done plenty of things wrong this evening, uncharacteristically so ... but kept on keeping on, and what reward! That\u2019s a fine goal out of nothing, the cream finally rising.     8.33pm   GOAL! Peterborough United 0-1 Manchester City (Mahrez 60)  Mahrez hasn\u2019t been on top form this evening ... until now. A loose ball down the right. He picks up possession, jinks into the box, uses Coulson as cover, drops a shoulder and steers a curler across Benda and into the bottom right. That\u2019s a delightful precision finish!    Updated at 9.12pm GMT    8.31pm    59 min: Foden sprays a lovely diagonal pass to Zinchenko on the left. For a second, Peterborough look exposed, but Ward sticks to his man like glue and forces him to turn tail.     8.29pm    57 min: Mahrez crosses from the right. Too much air. Goal kick. Benda still hasn\u2019t had his palms seriously warmed this evening.     8.28pm    56 min: Poku has a run at Stones down the left. He reaches the box and dribbles a shot goalwards from a tight angle. Ederson claims easily enough. City go up the other end, Zinchenko entering the Posh box on the left and slipping while shooting. Goal kick. A great cup-tie atmosphere at London Road.     8.26pm    55 min: \u201cCan we play you every week?\u201d chorus the Peterborough fans, following up with \u201cQue sera sera ... we\u2019re going to Wembley.\u201d A classic FA Cup medley. You\u2019ve got to sing them while you can.     8.25pm    53 min: Mahrez is working hard, though. He drives down the inside-right channel, only to be eased off the ball by Fuchs, who shepherds it out for a goal kick. Nothing\u2019s quite coming off for Mahrez this evening.     8.24pm    52 min: The expected second-half City charge hasn\u2019t quite materialised yet. Fernandinho tries to release Mahrez down the right but, as the ball flies out for a goal kick, realises his team-mate hasn\u2019t made any run. Oh dear.     8.23pm    50 min: City fancy a first FA Cup since 2019, though. Mahrez grooves down the right and stands one up for Jesus at the far stick. Jesus wafts his header over the bar. This game is great fun.     8.22pm    48 min: A couple of huge chances for Posh within a minute! A throw from the right is flicked on and drops to Szmodics on the penalty spot. He scuffs wide left. Then Knight burns down the right and cuts back for Grant, who has his leg cocked back, ready to shoot, when Foden slides in to make a stunning block. Peterborough are up for their first visit to the quarters since 1965!   Updated at 11.06pm GMT    8.20pm    47 min: Kent trips Foden, and at some cost, copping a boot in the mouth as the City player flies upside down over his outstretched leg. All innocent, and thankfully it doesn\u2019t look like the Peterborough man is badly hurt. He\u2019s up and about again soon enough.     8.18pm    46 min: Fuchs brings down an in-flight Grealish. Free kick out on the left. Gundogan whistles it straight down Benda\u2019s throat.     8.17pm    Posh get the second half started. City have made two changes, swapping out their central-defensive partnership of Ake and Dias with Laporte and Stones.     8.04pm    Half-time advertisement. Sign up now! Sign up now! Sign up now? Sign up now!      8.02pm   HALF TIME: Peterborough United 0-0 Manchester City  Cancelo loops a pass down the inside right. Jesus chests down but can\u2019t connect properly with his kick. And that\u2019s that for the first half. The bottom side in the Championship are holding the champions of England! As they depart for their half-time oranges, they get the roar of approval they deserve. The magic of the FA Cup, right here!     8.01pm    45 min: There will be one added minute.     8.01pm    44 min: Szmodics launches a ball down the middle. Jones races after it. He clatters into Ake, mid jump. Ake lands on his back and doesn\u2019t move ... but thankfully he\u2019s only been winded, and is soon up again. He accepts Jones\u2019 arm around the shoulder, one of apology and friendship, with good grace.     7.58pm    42 min: Now Gundogan crosses from the left. Jesus, falling backwards, can\u2019t get a header on target. The ball sails over the bar. City have been utterly dominant, and yet Benda hasn\u2019t had to make too many saves.     7.57pm    41 min: Mahrez diddles into some space on the right, checks back and floats a cross onto the head of Gundogan, who steers a header harmlessly wide right. Big chance, six yards out.     7.55pm    40 min: City come again. Another Zinchenko shot is blocked.     7.54pm    38 min: Zinchenko curls in from the left. Poku sticks out a leg to turn the cross behind for yet another City corner. Gundogan takes ... and Benda claims with great confidence. A marked contrast to the goalkeeper of 2 mins.     7.53pm    37 min: City probe and pass. Dias then swings one in from a deep position on the right ... and hoicks it straight out for a goal kick. City aren\u2019t exactly rattled, but they\u2019re struggling to find their high gears right now.     7.51pm    35 min: A long ball down the middle forces Ederson to charge out of his box and blooter clear, with Jones and Grant sniffing around. This has been staunch stuff from the hosts so far.     7.49pm    34 min: Benda is fine to continue. Not sure that Fernandinho challenge would have been tolerated in the Six Nations.     7.49pm    33 min: Benda claims Mahrez\u2019s corner, but he\u2019s cleaned out in mid-air by Fernandinho while doing so. A foul all day long. The whistle goes and on comes the trainer to give the keeper the once-over.   Updated at 8.02pm GMT    7.48pm    32 min: Grealish has the opportunity to release Mahrez into the Posh box on the right. He undercooks his pass, though, and has to settle for a corner, Kent intercepting and poking out.     7.46pm    30 min: This doesn\u2019t go so close. Grealish has a whack from a similar position. This one finds the top-right corner of the stand behind the goal. If nothing else, that amused the home support.     7.45pm    29 min: A little bit of space for Gundogan down the inside-left channel. Gundogan whips a low curler across Benda and inches wide of the right-hand post. The keeper might have stopped it, had it been on target ... but he might not. That was close. As close as City have come.     7.44pm    28 min: Gundogan wins a corner down the right. Mahrez finds Fernandinho at the near post. Fernandinho tries to trap, spin and shoot, but only manages to complete the first two tasks. Peterborough clear yet again.     7.42pm    27 min: Jones tries to beat Dias in a footrace down the left touchline. Dias holds him off in a much more authoritative manner than Ake.     7.41pm    25 min: Mahrez sashays past Coulson in super-elegant fashion, a dizzying shuffle sending him into the box on the right. He hits ... what? A shot? A cross? Either way, it\u2019s cleared by the home defence, Coulson taking the ball up the other end and nearly finding Jones down the left. The home side are holding firm.   Updated at 7.53pm GMT    7.39pm    23 min: Grealish makes good down the left and pulls back for Gundogan, who swivels and aims for the bottom right. He doesn\u2019t get enough on his shot and the hosts are able to clear.     7.37pm    21 min: There would have been trouble here for Posh, too, had Foden not clanked a pass down the inside-right channel out for a goal kick. Grealish had made an excellent bendy run and would have been free.     7.36pm    20 min: Jones is sprung clear down the left, but the flag pops up for offside. He was indeed well off. Ake was again nowhere, though, and had the young striker timed his run better, there would have been trouble for City.     7.35pm    19 min: Cancelo sends a simple pass, meant for Mahrez on the right, straight into touch. On the touchline, Pep stares at the ground with a mixture of sadness and mild irritation.     7.34pm    18 min: Posh are doing their best to press City all they can. The champions of England know they\u2019re in a game right now.     7.33pm    16 min: Gundogan wins a corner down the left. He takes himself. Edwards clears, and Posh counter. The livewire Jones scampers down the left, and is crudely tackled by Ake, who goes into the book. Ake walking a tightrope now, having already been isolated on two occasions, and found wanting on both.     7.31pm    14 min: The corner\u2019s played all the way back to Zinchenko, whose poor pass is intercepted by Ward. He scoots down the right, then feeds Jones, who eventually ships possession ... but that\u2019s another promising break by the hosts, who look lively whenever they get the ball.  Updated at 7.31pm GMT    7.29pm    13 min: The corner\u2019s hit long. Dias competes for a header at the far post, but can\u2019t get anything on target. Posh clear their lines. City come back at them quicksmart. Mahrez, in the thick of it during these early exchanges, fires for the bottom right. Blocked. Cancelo has a go down the right this time. Another corner. This is relentless pressure.     7.27pm    12 min: Mahrez, down the right, earns City\u2019s first corner of the night. He takes it himself. The ball bobbles through a crowded mixer, and Jesus picks up possession on the other side, winning a corner on the left this time. Gundogan to take.     7.26pm    10 min: Posh finally show in the City half ... and nearly score! A brilliant run down the inside-right channel by Fuchs, who has the beating of Ake. He enters the box and sends a forensic effort towards the bottom right. It\u2019s heading in at pace, and Ederson does extremely well to tip it around the post. The keeper claims the resulting corner easily enough.     7.25pm    8 min: Cancelo enters the box from the right and performs three dragbacks in short order. Party stuff. His cross is a bit deep, though. Grealish, Foden and Jesus triangulate just inside the area on the left. The ball\u2019s eventually pulled back for Zinchenko, who sends another wild shot high over the bar. You already get the sense City desperately want their Ukrainian team-mate to score.   Updated at 7.55pm GMT    7.22pm    6 min: Peterborough haven\u2019t seen too much of the ball yet. Gundogan strides down the middle, laying off to Foden on his right. Foden shuttles it further wide for Mahrez. The ball takes a bobble and he lumps a dreadful cross deep into the stand. \u201cPremier League, you\u2019re having a laugh,\u201d trill the home fans, taking the rise out of the champions while they still can. The magic of the cup.     7.20pm    4 min: City pass it around in, well, the City style. Probing this way and that. Grealish cuts back from an advanced position down the inside-left channel to tee up Zinchenko, who slices a wild effort high and miles left. The situation in Ukraine notwithstanding, the home fans enjoy ripping him for that one.     7.18pm    2 min: Benda nearly suffers a catastrophic start in the Peterborough goal, dropping the ball to pass upfield but failing to notice Jesus closing him down at warp speed. Jesus blocks the kick, the ball rebounding and only just missing the open goal to the left. That won\u2019t settle any pre-match nerves.      7.16pm    1 min: A first touch of the ball for Zinchenko is met with cheers of support.     7.15pm    City get the ball rolling ... but only after they take the knee, while Peterborough line up along the centre circle to stand for equality. The gestures are met with warm applause all around London Road.     7.14pm    The teams are out! Peterborough are in royal blue with white sleeves and a distressed white sash. City sport second-choice white and green shorts. Zinchenko and Posh captain Frankie Kent carry a Ukrainian flag between them. We\u2019ll be off in a minute.    Updated at 7.51pm GMT    7.11pm    ITV grab a quick pre-match word with Guardiola regarding Zinchenko. \u201cOur captain decided to give the armband to him, to show how important the situation is. All the club are behind this gesture. He will represent his country.\u201d     6.57pm    Some pre-match reading for those wanting to familiarise themselves with the Posh. Ben Fisher is your guide.      6.42pm    Solidarity with Ukraine. Fans of both teams have been arriving at London Road with placards and flags supporting the Ukrainian struggle. Oleksandr Zinchenko, so emotional when Goodison got behind him four-square on Saturday, will hopefully be buoyed by another heartfelt gesture.    Updated at 6.53pm GMT    6.27pm    Manchester City defender Oleksandr Zinchenko starts his first game since his home country Ukraine was attacked by Russia. He\u2019s named as City captain, and one of six changes to the team selected for the 1-0 win at Everton on Saturday evening. \u201cI think it will be good for him to play,\u201d says his manager Pep Guardiola. Jack Grealish plays for the first time in nearly a month, when City beat Brentford 2-0 at the Etihad. Nathan Ake, Fernandinho, Riyad Mahrez and Gabriel Jesus also start.  Peterborough United manager Grant McCann meanwhile makes five changes to the XI named for the 3-0 defeat by Hull City at the weekend. Ricky-Jade Jones, 19, is the lone forward, understandable pragmatism winning the day. Jorge Grant, Kwame Poku, Jeando Fuchs and Hayden Coulson are also in the first XI.   Updated at 8.45pm GMT    6.22pm   The teams  Peterborough United: Benda, Knight, Edwards, Kent, Ward, Grant, Fuchs, Coulson, Poku, Jade-Jones, Szmodics.Subs: Beevers, Clarke-Harris, Brown, Cornell, Marriott, Burrows, Corbett, Mumba, Barker.

                    "body": "The Norwegian government has stepped in to end a strike that had threatened supplies of gas to Britain. The labour dispute had shut down oil and gasfields and was expected to cut Norway\u2019s gas supplies by almost 60% by the weekend. Gassco, Oslo\u2019s state-owned pipeline operator, had warned that \u201cin a worst-case scenario, deliveries to the UK could stop totally\u201d. Workers demanded a pay increase to handle rising inflation, which has been triggered in part by a jump in oil and gas prices since Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. However, the Norwegian government has the power to intervene to end industrial disputes. The country\u2019s labour minister, Marte Mj\u00f8s Persen, said: \u201cWhen the conflict can have such great social consequences for the whole of Europe, I have no choice but to intervene in the conflict.\u201d Gas prices had soared in recent days as the strike action threatened to exacerbate the existing supply crunch, but their rally was halted on Wednesday after the announcement. However, this respite from rising gas prices may be short lived, with the Nord Stream 1 gas pipeline from Russia to Germany scheduled for maintenance from 11-21 July. Goldman Sachs said it did not believe that flows through Nord Stream 1 would be completely restored after the work was completed. The investment bank raised its forecasts for European natural gas prices to average \u20ac153 per MW hour in the third quarter of 2022, \u20ac121 in the fourth quarter and \u20ac138 next summer. The Dutch wholesale gas contract for September delivery dropped 7.5% to \u20ac161 per MW hour on Wednesday. European countries have been scrambling to fill their gas storage sites before the winter for fear that Russia will cut off supplies altogether. Britain sources about a third of its gas from Norway and the remainder from a combination of the North Sea, other parts of Europe and imports of liquefied natural gas from the rest of the world, including the US.  Germany is far more reliant on Russian gas and fears are growing over the knock-on effect of Russia reducing gas supplies. The Deutsche Bank analyst Jim Reid said: \u201cEconomy minister [Robert] Habeck has talked about gas as potentially being a Lehman Brothers moment, so the stakes are high. Indeed, this is a heavy cloud hanging over European assets at the moment.\u201d Samuel Tombs, the chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said Britain could cope without Russian gas. He said: \u201cThe small hole that will be left by Russian imports falling to zero by the end of this year \u2013 as the UK government has pledged \u2013 should be covered easily by a pickup in liquefied natural gas imports from the US and Qatar.\u201d Separately on Wednesday, a Russian court told the Caspian Pipeline Consortium, which transfers oil from Kazakhstan to the Black Sea, to halt its activities for 30 days. The pipeline is one of the largest in the world and exports about 1.2m barrels a day. Despite the court order, exports are still flowing, Reuters reported."

                    "body": "Often the bridesmaid in big races this spring, jockey Mark Zahra was able to turn around his fortunes when triumphant aboard Gold Trip in the 2022 Melbourne Cup. Desperately unlucky when finishing second in the Caulfield Cup, the top-weight for the 162nd running of the famous race dashed clear in the straight for a decisive victory. The French-bred six-year-old, who started at 18-1, seized the lead 300 metres from the finish and was able to hold off Emissary, with stablemate High Emocean finishing third. Race favourite Deauville Legend looked the winner for a fleeting moment in the home straight but weakened to finish fourth behind Gold Trip, which carried 57.5kg to victory.  The triumph makes up for the devastation Zahra, 40, felt 12 months ago as he watched Verry Elleegant triumph while sidelined and also for the disappointment he experienced with a string of near misses over the past month. After finishing second in the Caulfield Cup on the Ciaron Maher and David Eustace-trained Gold Trip, he also finished runner-up on I\u2019m Thunderstruck in the Cox Plate at Moonee Valley. Riding in Kalgoorlie at the turn of the century, the WA-raised jockey never imagined he would have a chance to ride in the Melbourne Cup. But having established himself a top flight horseman, he was booked to ride Verry Elleegant at the start of the mare\u2019s campaign for the 2021 Melbourne Cup campaign. But the 40-year-old missed Verry Elleegant\u2019s triumph when among the jockeys banned for attending a house party in breach of Covid-19 guidelines which led to a three-month suspension. He watched in a drunken despair from Byron Bay as the champion mare produced a brilliant run. \u201cThis time last year I was in Byron Bay and I was getting told off for drinking too much, [because] it could have been my ride. [It is] redemption day today. It is a miracle,\u201d he said. \u201cTwelve months I felt terrible and I was drinking my way out of it and [my wife Elyse] was saying, \u2018Don\u2019t drink too much\u2019. I said, \u2018What do you want me to do? My horse just won the Melbourne Cup.\u2019 For today to come, and I\u2019ve got good mates in [Gold Trip], it is just unbelievable.\u201d Showing great confidence in the staying capabilities of Gold Trip, Zahra rode a heady race to claim the Melbourne Cup for the first time. But as he returned to scale, he conceded that never had a straight felt as long as the punishing finish at Flemington, as he feared Gold Trip may have hit the front too early. \u201cI got to the front a bit soon but he is a horse that, when you go for it, you have to go. You don\u2019t want to give him time to think about it,\u201d he said. \u201cI can\u2019t put this triumph into words. It is unbelievable.\u201d  Maher praised Gold Trip, which finished an unlucky ninth in the Cox Plate before rebounding strongly at Flemington to record its second win from 16 starts. The triumph makes up for a controversy a year ago when Gold Trip was scratched on the eve of the Cox Plate when stood down by stewards, a decision Maher described as \u201cpretty embarrassing\u201d given the stable believed the horse was fit to compete. \u201cTo run in three of the big ones and then present in the cup like that was fantastic,\u201d he said. \u201cMark was very good on him in the Caulfield Cup. We knew he had that good turn of foot and he was fantastic today. It is unbelievable. It is a dream come true. I am just thrilled.\u201d Maher\u2019s first memory of the Melbourne Cup was when watching the race as a schoolboy at the Mailors Flat Primary School in western Victoria. At that stage, his family was into motorbikes. But he was hooked. He pursued a career as a jumps jockey about the time Zahra moved east to Victoria. The pair became friends. After the triumph, Zahra said he could remember the beer cans lying around Maher\u2019s place after parties in their youth. He suspected the Gold Trip team might celebrate in grander style on Tuesday night.  Eustace was raised in England but has formed a formidable training partnership with Maher since moving to Victoria. \u201cObviously I am a bit overcome,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is a dream to win it. It is a pinnacle for our sport. I am so grateful to be training with him. This horse, who was so unlucky in the Caulfield Cup \u2026 it is quite incredible.\u201d Interpretation, another stablemate of the winner, did not finish, though the Maher and Eustace camp said it appeared the stallion had suffered a wind issue. Three horses were officially listed as finishing distanced \u2013 Numerian at 73 lengths behind the winner, and Camorra and Serpentine 99 lengths adrift. A field of 22 jumped after the late scratchings of Point Nepean with an elevated blood count on Monday and Lunar Flare due to lameness on Tuesday morning. Leading contenders Loft and Durston, the Caulfield Cup winner, were withdrawn prior to acceptances after stewards found soundness issues. Torrential rain that fell on Melbourne earlier on Tuesday cleared for the marquee event, but come the 3pm start time the track was hardly dry. A section near the 1,500m mark has also sustained damage in the early hours of Tuesday morning when protesters poured an unknown fluid onto the surface. The track was cleaned and repaired before being deemed fit to race on. Police say they are investigating the incident."

                    "body": "The UK economy unexpectedly grew by 0.1% in November as consumers headed to the shops in the run-up to Christmas and pubs and bars enjoyed a boost from the men\u2019s World Cup. Raising the government\u2019s chances of avoiding a long recession, City economists said hard-pressed consumers had proved more resilient than forecast despite the cost of living crisis. However, business groups warned that the economy was likely to suffer over the coming months as higher mortgage rates and the withdrawal of state support for energy bills begin to hit disposable incomes further. A downturn in the manufacturing sector also limited the strength of the economy and meant that over the three months to November the economy contracted by 0.3%, according to the Office for National Statistics. The British Chambers of Commerce said it was significant that the boost to consumer-facing industries, including retail, wholesale and hospitality, had failed to overcome a dramatic loss of sales compared with pre-pandemic levels. \u201cThe figures provide further evidence that UK economic growth is heading in the wrong direction despite this period normally being among the busiest for the retail sector. \u201cWhile month-on-month GDP grew by 0.1%, this is a volatile measure. The three-month average, standing at \u20130.3%, sends a clearer signal of the current trajectory of the economy,\u201d it said. The ONS said that sectors selling directly to consumers had suffered an 8.5% fall in income since February 2020 and that unlike other G7 countries, the whole economy remained smaller than it was three years ago. Cost of living pressures are likely to become more acute this year as tax rises and the withdrawal of government subsidies take effect.  Ministers are poised to increase unit gas and electricity prices for consumers from April, pushing the average bill to \u00a33,000, up from \u00a32,500. Meanwhile, interest rate rises by the Bank of England mean average annual payments for millions of mortgage holders will increase by \u00a33,000. The Bank of England has warned that the UK is probably set for a long recession, as defined by two consecutive quarters of contraction. The economy shrank by 0.3% in the third quarter between July and September, and figures for the October to December period will be published next month, confirming whether or not the economy entered recession at that point. Samuel Tombs, the chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said the verdict \u201changs in the balance\u201d but it was almost certain a recession was coming in the first half of 2023. \u201cLooking ahead, we continue to think that GDP will drop substantially in the first and second quarters of this year.\u201d James Smith, a senior economist at ING, downplayed the prospect of the UK suffering a bigger downturn than other developed nations. \u201cWe\u2019re looking for a peak-to-trough fall in GDP of a little more than 1.5%, which would match closest with the early 1990s recession in terms of scale,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd despite the UK\u2019s many woes, particularly in the jobs market, we aren\u2019t convinced Britain will be a serious outlier from the rest of Europe on the hit to GDP this year, even if it probably does sit in the bottom half of the pack.\u201d Analysts have warned that some of the trends in the data were difficult to judge after a series of events that distorted the usual pattern. November\u2019s 0.1% rise represented a slowdown compared with 0.5% growth in October, when the economy rebounded from a weak September, caused in part by the closure of many businesses for the Queen\u2019s funeral. A Reuters poll of City economists predicted the economy would shrink by 0.2 % in November. Jeremy Hunt said his priority was to bring down inflation to alleviate the cost of living crisis and revive the economy. \u201cWe have a clear plan to halve inflation this year \u2013 an insidious hidden tax which has led to hikes in interest rates and mortgage costs, holding back growth here and around the world,\u201d the chancellor said."

                    "body": "In the minutes before England went out to warm-up for their match against Wales last Saturday, Eddie Jones gave the team a last pep talk. \u201cThis is the day, boys, where you can really put the team forward,\u201d he told them. \u201cAnd old England and new England come together.\u201d Two hours later, they had won 23-19 but Jones, and everyone else, was still waiting for that performance he had spoken about.

They have been working on it in Bristol this week on a three-day training camp at Clifton college, before their back-to-back matches against Ireland and France, the two best teams in the tournament. England have it in them to beat both but will have to play better than they have done. England cannot afford to keep waiting for that moment when everything clicks. \u201cThat\u2019s definitely the vibe in the camp,\u201d says Harry Randall. \u201cWe feel we\u2019ve been very close, like in that first-half performance against Wales. On another day we could have scored two or three of those chances and then at half-time we\u2019d be up by 20, 25 points. So we feel like we\u2019re very nearly there.\u201d England had more than 60% of the possession in the first half against Wales, just like they did when they lost to Scotland, but did not manage to score a try in either half. So a lot of the work now, Randall says, \u201cis around what we do when we get into their 22 and we\u2019re putting them under pressure, how can we be more clinical in that area.\u201d Jones has been drilling them in this new \u201cfree-formation\u201d attack, which in theory means that after the first couple of attacking phases, everything should be unpredictable and fluid, with the playmakers making spontaneous decisions, and runners swapping in and out of positions. But as Jones has said, that depends on the understanding between the scrum-half, the fly-half, the inside centre and the men around them, who all need to be able anticipate one another\u2019s thinking and organise themselves accordingly in the split-seconds available. So far in this Six Nations, England have not seemed to have the confidence or cohesion to make it work.  Randall believes it is coming. \u201cThe more you play with someone the better connection you have,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m really enjoying playing with Marcus [Smith]. We\u2019re still learning a lot from playing with each other. It\u2019s about building that partnership and connection on and off the field, because that 9-10 axis is very important to controlling the team. \u201cI\u2019ve played four games with him now, we\u2019re slowly getting there game by game. Hopefully, we get the chance to play with each other more but training is probably the best place to keep on working at that connection. We sit down after and go through clips, talking to each other about what we both want. You get out what you put into it.\u201d England fans will not necessarily thank him for it, but for Jones, all this is a bet on being ready by the next World Cup. You can hear him thinking about it in the way he has been talking. He has described these last three matches as a quarter-final, semi-final and final and is encouraging the players to think that way. Time is getting tight there, too, given how much team-building they still have to do. Smith is 23, Randall 24 and they have played 12 Tests between them. After these two games they have the summer tour to Australia and three autumn internationals, one more Six Nations and then into the World Cup warm-up matches. Which explains why Jones has finally decided to move Randall into the starting XV, when the position has belonged to Ben Youngs for the past four years. After 115 caps Jones knows exactly what he will get from Youngs: he is steady, accurate and does not make many bad decisions. Jones trusts him to run the game. But Randall offers the promise of something different, something a little more threatening, a little \u201czip-zip\u201d Jones calls it. He brings a pace to the game and a threat around the breakdown the team have not really had in that position since Danny Care played his last game in the autumn of 2018. \u201cI was delighted,\u201d Randall says when asked how it felt to start against Wales, \u201cbut it doesn\u2019t matter if I start, he starts, or Raffi Quirke comes in. Whoever it is we\u2019ve got to do what\u2019s best for the team.\u201d Which might be true but they, and everyone else, need to grow into the new roles, with Youngs playing finisher, and \u201csquadfather\u201d, to the group, while Randall gets used to setting the tempo in the first hour of the match. Randall says they dovetail well.  \u201cWe work together a lot, do a lot of passing and kicking, always learning off each other. Ben is the most-capped men\u2019s international now so it\u2019s pretty awesome to be learning off him. We\u2019ve got a good relationship, we help each other out, we always talk and connect with each other about things. It\u2019s good to bounce off each other and give each other ideas.\u201d The idea is that one of these days all this study is going to have to pay off and England will spring forward. Jones will hope it is sooner rather than later."

Here\u2019s what Virgil van Dijk had just said:  Hard work. A lot of counters, it was an intense game, let\u2019s say that. A lot of offside goals. That rule of just keep playing on until I don\u2019t know when, it\u2019s annoying. Something we have to consider maybe taking out for next season, that\u2019s my opinion. Unnecessary metres, unnecessary challenges that come from it. The penalties were quite good, all of them, except for the last penalty.  On Matip\u2019s disallowed goal:  I don\u2019t understand this rule. I wasn\u2019t even participating in this moment, the ball went over my head, I didn\u2019t even go for the ball. It\u2019s a game full of challenges and you\u2019re allowed to block and move and do all these things, and I don\u2019t understand it. I don\u2019t want to start being negative about this game, it was very intense, we won it, the first trophy of hopefully a couple more this season.  And here\u2019s a good photograph:  And here\u2019s the match report again. Bye!   Updated at 8.11pm GMT    7.59pm    Jurgen Klopp has had a brief chat with Sky:   I would have been fine with 90 minutes, 1-0 Liverpool and we go home. I\u2019m happy for the people, in difficult times, to celebrate something like this. It\u2019s really nice. Chelsea were incredibly strong, we matched each other. You need to have luck, we needed luck tonight. The game could have been 5-5. We play Wednesday again, which I can\u2019t believe at this moment, but Anfield will be rocking and we\u2019ll give it a try.      7.53pm    <b>Here\u2019s a match report:</b>      7.49pm    \u201cNever on a football field has the selection of a player better illustrated the truth that after Hubris comes Nemesis,\u201d writes Charles Antaki. \u201cI bet Tuchel knows his classical myths now.\u201d That\u2019s a very Guardian email, thankyou for writing it. Meanwhile here\u2019s former Watford and Brentford goalkeeper Rich Lee:      7.44pm    Virgil van Dijk emerges from the presentation clutching the Alan Hardaker Trophy for man of the match. There were several outstanding performances: Luis Diaz, Fabinho, Marcos Alonso, Antonio Rudiger, both starting keepers spring to mind, but there weren\u2019t many disappointments.     7.42pm    The beauty of it is that every single player who was still on the pitch at the end of extra time took a penalty in the shoot-out. In many ways 11-10 is the perfect shoot-out scoreline.     7.40pm    After a long wait and much careful positioning, it\u2019s Jordan Henderson who takes the pot, turns and holds it aloft!     7.37pm    James Milner, who started on the bench but was on-field captain when the final was decided, leads the Liverpool team up the steps to collect their trophy.      7.35pm    My sympathies for Chelsea, who contributed so much to a gripping final. But bringing a keeper on for a penalty shoot-out only for him to let in 11 and then miss his own is just hilarious.   Updated at 7.38pm GMT    7.33pm    An email from Katya Barrett in Massachusetts. \u201cMy grandma (a recently obsessed Liverpool fan in her 80s, watching from New Jersey in the US after some struggles getting her signed into ESPN+) says, \u2018I can\u2019t believe it. Is this real?\u2019\u201d The beautiful game. It\u2019s never too late to discover it.   Updated at 7.37pm GMT    7.30pm    Twenty-two penalties, drama ratcheting ever higher with every passing second, and not a single save! The 90 minutes were phenomenal, and the shoot-out was remarkable. What a couple of hours of sport. You\u2019ll Never Walk Alone rings out. Thiago, who started the game on the bench and in tears, is on the pitch with a smile from ear to ear.   Updated at 7.34pm GMT    7.27pm   Kepa does decide it! Liverpool have won the Carabao Cup!  Missed! Chelsea 10-11 Liverpool! Kepa, brought on for the shoot-out, sends his penalty high, high over the bar!    Updated at 7.31pm GMT    7.27pm    SCORED! Chelsea 10-11 Liverpool! Kelleher scores a lovely, lovely penalty, high into the net with Kepa going the wrong way!     7.26pm    SCORED! Chelsea 10-10 Liverpool! Trevoh Chalobah makes it a full house among the outfield players, Kelleher diving underneath it. Keepers up next!     7.25pm    SCORED! Chelsea 9-10 Liverpool! Konate gives Kepa a chance, but it comes off the side of the keeper\u2019s glove and in!     7.25pm    SCORED! Chelsea 9-9 Liverpool! Thiago Silva tucks it away. Kelleher\u2019s dive was the half-hearted effort of someone who is starting to lose belief.     7.24pm    SCORED! Chelsea 8-9 Liverpool! Harvey Elliot with the 17th successive successful penalty. We could be here a while.     7.23pm    SCORED! Chelsea 8-8 Liverpool! Close! Werner goes low to his left, Kelleher goes the right way, and you hear the clear sound of glove on ball shortly before that of ball on net.     7.22pm    SCORED! Chelsea 7-8 Liverpool! Andy Robertson tucks it to his left, with Kepa diving away from it.     7.22pm    SCORED! Chelsea 7-7 Liverpool! Kante\u2019s penalty is lovely, curled into the left-hand corner with Kelleher again calling it wrong.     7.21pm    SCORED! Chelsea 6-7 Liverpool! Origi also goes low and central, with Kepa again committing early.     7.20pm    SCORED! Chelsea 6-6 Liverpool! Rudiger with the dreaded short, straight run-up. No matter, he passes it mid-height to the right, and Kelleher goes the wrong way again.      7.20pm    SCORED! Chelsea 5-6 Liverpool! So many chances in the game, none of them taken (and those that were taken disallowed). Now they can\u2019t stop scoring! Jota goes low and hard down the middle, by a distance the poorest penalty so far, but it doesn\u2019t much matter because Kepa dives out of the way!     7.18pm    SCORED! Chelsea 5-5 Liverpool! Jorginho does what Jorginho does.      7.18pm    SCORED! Chelsea 4-5 Liverpool! Salah wallops it high to his right, while Kepa goes low to Salah\u2019s left.     7.17pm    SCORED! Chelsea 4-4 Liverpool! Reece James shoots just past Kelleher, who goes the right way and got fingertips to it. He turns to the Liverpool fans, finger to his lips. It\u2019s sudden death now!     7.16pm    SCORED! Chelsea 3-4 Liverpool! Make that seven, Alexander-Arnold hitting the side netting with Kepa again going the right way.     7.15pm    SCORED! Chelsea 3-3 Liverpool! Havertz strolls up to the ball and passes it low to his right, with Keller heading the wrong way. Six excellent pennos so far.     7.14pm    SCORED! Chelsea 2-3 Liverpool! Kepa goes the right way this time, and early. But Van Dijk smashes it past him anyway!      7.14pm    SCORED! Chelsea 2-2 Liverpool! A little stutter from Lukaku sends Kelleher to his right, and the ball goes where he doesn\u2019t!     7.13pm    SCORED! Chelsea 1-2 Liverpool! You can take the Brazilian out of Brazil, etc and so forth. Fabinho dinks down the middle and lets Kepa dive out of the way!     7.12pm    SCORED! Chelsea 1-1 Liverpool! Alonso blasts low to his right, and Kelleher goes the right way but can\u2019t reach it.     7.11pm    SCORED! Chelsea 0-1 Liverpool! Kepa goes the wrong way, and the ball whistles low into the other corner!     7.10pm    James Milner wins the toss, and it looks like Liverpool will take the first penalty, in front of their own fans. Milner himself has the ball in his hands.     7.09pm    \u201cI really hope Mendy refuses to come off,\u201d wrote Matt Dony, shortly before Mendy came off. It would have been a very jolly jape, though.     7.09pm    Extra time didn\u2019t quite live up to the preceding 90 minutes, but it\u2019s been a great final. Time for someone to win it.     7.07pm   Penalty shoot-out ahoy! It's finished Chelsea 0-0 Liverpool  90+31 mins: One more hopeful punt forward from Liverpool ends with a number of players falling over and the ball going nowhere, at which point the referee blows his whistle!   Updated at 7.09pm GMT    7.05pm    90+30 mins: We are one minute away from penalties.     7.04pm    90+29 mins: Alexander-Arnold chips the ball into the penalty area, it runs behind off Origi\u2019s shin, and Chelsea make their change. Mendy has had an excellent game, but he is not going to be on the pitch when it\u2019s decided. Kepa comes on for the spot kicks.     7.02pm    90+28 mins: Robertson\u2019s low cross runs to Jota, who swings his left foot and misses it completely!     7.01pm    90+27 mins: Kepa has now put his gloves on. Liverpool should pass the ball around for the remainder of the match and make sure he stays on the bench.     7.00pm    90+25 mins: Rudiger makes his first mistake of the game, losing the ball to Salah just outside Chelsea\u2019s penalty area, but the Egyptian can\u2019t convert possession into a chance.     6.58pm    90+24 mins: On the touchline, we see Kepa come out from the dressing rooms, gloves in hand.      6.57pm    90+22 mins: Liverpool pass the ball around for a while, but when they eventually push forward Jota can\u2019t control Milner\u2019s pass.     6.55pm    90+20 mins: Another disallowed goal! Lukaku gets the ball on the left and passes inside to Havertz, who controls and drills a low shot across Kelleher and in. Very nice finish, but he was a yard offside.   Updated at 6.59pm GMT    6.54pm    90+19 mins: Liverpool have been struggling to control midfield and keep possession since Henderson went off. They have been on the back foot for the great majority of extra time.     6.50pm    90+16 mins: Peeeeeeeep! Lukaku kicks off. Will that be the day\u2019s last kick-off?     6.49pm    Romelu Lukaku seems to be delivering Chelsea\u2019s team talk. Tuchel eventually takes over. Jorginho, who was always going to come on before anyone started taking penalties, replaces Kovacic.     6.48pm   Half time in extra time: Chelsea 0-0 Liverpool  90+17 mins: A less intense period than any in the initial 90, but compelling all the same. We are 15 minutes away from penalties.   Updated at 6.57pm GMT    6.46pm    90+16 mins: Alexander-Arnold and Havertz get in a bit of a tangle, and then put foreheads together. Harvey Elliott then comes along to push Havertz in the chest. Both Alexander-Arnold and Havertz get booked.      6.44pm    90+15 mins: Havertz\u2019 cross is just too high for Werner, and James\u2019s cross that follows it bounces out for a throw-in on the other side.     6.42pm    90+12 mins: Chelsea are having their most prolonged period of possession of the game, but Liverpool are keeping them out of their penalty area. In other news:      6.38pm   GOAL? No! Lukaku's offside!  90+8 mins: Lukaku is played in down the right, runs into the area, cuts onto his left foot and shoots low past Kelleher, but the lino has a flag up. VAR checks it, and it\u2019s cigarette paper tight but is, it seems, indeed offside.    Updated at 6.41pm GMT    6.36pm    90+7 mins: Divock Origi comes on for Diaz, who might be knackered, and might just have a sore arse from that ball-falling business.     6.35pm    90+6 mins: Werner runs across the area from left to right before feeding Kante, who tries to ... well ... it\u2019s hard to know what he was trying to do, but whatever it was he didn\u2019t do it. Goal kick.     6.33pm    90+5 mins: Werner tries to curl the ball into the far corner, but doesn\u2019t get enough curl.     6.32pm    90+3 mins: In possibly his first misstep of the day, Diaz runs onto Robertson\u2019s pass, just keeps it in play, falls over, and lands on the ball.      6.29pm    90+1 mins: Liverpool kick off again.  Updated at 6.31pm GMT    6.29pm    Another change before the restart, Liverpool bringing Ibrahima Konate on for Matip.     6.26pm    Expected goals latest: Chelsea 1.72-1.80 Liverpool.     6.25pm   It's going to extra time!  90+7 mins: The whistle blows, and a bonus 30 minutes await. Nobody will be complaining (except the Liverpool fans still annoyed about the disallowed goal).     6.23pm    90+5 mins: One more save, this time from Kelleher! Alonso crosses from the byline, and Lukaku turns it goalwards from wide of the near post only for Kelleher to get his feet in the way.     6.20pm    90+3 mins: Diaz goes past Chalobah for the nth time today, winning a late corner.     6.19pm    90+1 mins: Another excellent save from Mendy! This time Alexander-Arnold\u2019s corner is headed towards the corner of the net by Van Dijk, but Mendy dives to his left to palm it away! Then Kovacic blocks Salah\u2019s follow-up shot from the edge of the area.     6.17pm    90+1 mins: There will be six minutes of stoppage time.     6.17pm    90 mins: Kovacic is booked for pulling down Salah to prevent a Liverpool break.     6.17pm    88 mins: A bit of a lull! It\u2019s the first one of those since perhaps the 90 first-half seconds when Van Dijk, Fabinho and Matip passed it around a bit.     6.13pm    85 mins: From a short corner Robertson pulls back to Diaz, whose shot is saved by Mendy and runs out to Robertson, whose shot is also saved!   Updated at 6.22pm GMT    6.09pm    82 mins: Milner plays a one-two with Salah before shooting and falling over at the same time. The ball goes very high and extremely wide.     6.08pm    81 mins: Stuart Attwell pops to the touchline to tell Jurgen Klopp to calm down.     6.08pm    80 mins: \u201cThe Liverpool goal was correctly disallowed due to Van Dijk interfering with play while in an offside position, not for a foul,\u201d pointofinformations Danny Michaux, correctly.     6.07pm    79 mins: A triple substitution for Liverpool: Harvey Elliott, promoted to the bench because of Thiago\u2019s injury, comes on for Henderson, while James Milner replaces Keita and Diogo Jota comes on for Mane.     6.06pm    78 mins: Another disallowed goal! This one doesn\u2019t last long enough to be celebrated. Diaz loses the ball and Kovacic chips it over the defence to Werner, whose cross is headed in by Havertz, despite Kelleher very nearly pulling off what would have been a truly exceptional save. Werner, though, was well offside.   Updated at 6.10pm GMT    6.03pm    76 mins: Another save! Alexander-Arnold\u2019s driven long pass, right to left, is controlled by Diaz who runs into the area and shoots low from an angle, too close to Mendy.     6.02pm    75 mins: Diaz tricks his way past James before doing a no-look pass to Mane. He\u2019s been phenomenal so far, along with Havertz the outstanding attacking players.     6.01pm    73 mins: Chelsea make a double change, taking off Mount and Pulisic and bringing on Romelu Lukaku and Timo Werner.     5.58pm    71 mins: The wind is in Liverpool\u2019s sails now. Diaz\u2019s pull-back is just too far ahead of Keita, and Thiago Silva clears.     5.57pm   NO GOAL! VAR intervenes and it's still 0-0!  The goal is disallowed for a Van Dijk foul on Reece James, who would have been more likely to challenge Mane for the initial header had the Dutchman not put an arm across him. Clearly there was contact there, but I think that\u2019s harsh.   Updated at 6.00pm GMT    5.55pm   GOAL! Chelsea 0-1 Liverpool (Matip, 67 mins)  Liverpool take the lead! Salah wins a free-kick on the right-hand corner of the area. Alexander-Arnold crosses beyond the far post, where Mane heads back across goal for Matip to touch in from a yard or two out!   Updated at 6.07pm GMT    5.52pm    64 mins: Chance for Liverpool! Mendy comes out but scuffs his clearance straight to Fabinho, and from his first-time pass Mane releases Salah. He runs into the area, draws the keeper, and chips in a shot that looked to be bouncing wide even before Thiago Silva got back to clear!   Updated at 6.12pm GMT    5.51pm    63 mins: Alonso gets forward to win a corner, Chelsea\u2019s first. Liverpool have had six, for what it\u2019s worth.     5.48pm    60 mins: Keita and Chalobah collide in midfield and the referee, who has been admirably reluctant to stop play throughout, waves play on. Liverpool\u2019s move ends with Robertson\u2019s poor cross - not the first today - which is probably just as well given replays show Keita landing studs on Chalobah\u2019s right thigh, not a red card but certainly a foul.     5.46pm    58 mins: Alonso chips the ball down the left flank into the path of Mount\u2019s run. He exchanges passes with Havertz, comes infield, and curls a shot straight at Kelleher.     5.44pm    57 mins: Azpilicueta has gone off, and James has come on.     5.43pm    55 mins: The referee calls on the Chelsea physios, with Azpilicueta struggling. It\u2019s hard to see what the problem is, but Reece James immediately starts to get ready.      5.40pm    53 mins: Great footage of Tuchel watching that Mount miss, dropping to his knees and bashing the ground in frustration.      5.39pm    51 mins: Chelsea were under the cosh for much of the first half but across the piece they have played brilliantly, defended excellently, created a few wonderful chances, and really should be winning.     5.38pm    50 mins: Now Diaz plays the ball over Chelsea\u2019s defence, but Mendy is out like lightning and reaches it before Mane.     5.37pm    49 mins: Chance of the game for Chelsea! Pulisic chips the ball over the Liverpool defence, Mount breaks the offside trap and runs clear, and he sidefoots past Kelleher but against the inside of the post!    Updated at 5.43pm GMT    5.35pm    48 mins: Ooooh! Havertz sends in a low cross from the left that goes across goal, just out of Mount\u2019s reach, and out the other side!     5.32pm    46 mins: Peeeeeep! Chelsea get the ball re-rolling.     5.32pm    The players are back out, and they look to be the same lot that ended the first half.     5.21pm    A short word as we\u2019ve got a few minutes.

It\u2019s been breathless, high-pace, high-quality stuff, but also high discipline and organisation. Liverpool have had 69% of possession and 100% of the corners, but Chelsea have created two of the three outstanding chances.    Updated at 5.31pm GMT    5.16pm    45 mins: What a chance for Chelsea! Mane gives the ball away, and Pulisic passes right to Havertz, who caresses the ball infield to Mount, who with the ball coming just behind him volleys wide from eight yards!    Updated at 5.20pm GMT    5.13pm    42 mins: Havertz nudges back to Azpilicueta, whose shot isn\u2019t far away from nestling in the far corner. Liverpool have been dominant for the last 20 minutes or so, but Chelsea have been organised enough to stand up to it, and threaten occasionally on the break.     5.10pm    39 mins: Mane plays for a free kick as Kovacic comes to challenge, but the referee waves play on and Chelsea break, Havertz finds Pulisic, and Kelleher saves his angled shot.     5.06pm    35 mins: Havertz is played through, and despite being obviously offside is allowed to run on and miss the chance before play is brought back.      5.02pm    31 mins: They\u2019ve had a chance now! Again it starts with a long ball down the left, beautifully controlled by Diaz. Mane touches his pass back to Keita, whose low drive is well saved by Mendy. The ball runs out to Mane, who looks to have a tap-in, but Mendy gets up to get something on it! That is a fantastic second save from the Chelsea keeper!    Updated at 5.16pm GMT    5.00pm    30 mins: Another beautiful first touch, this time from Salah. Liverpool have completely dominated the last 10 minutes, but remain in search of a decent chance.     4.59pm    28 mins: A shout for handball against Azpilicueta from a Liverpool corner, but there was nothing there.     4.57pm    25 mins: Mount pressures Keita and then goes down clutching his face. The referee blows his whistle, and Liverpool\u2019s players react with the kind of overblown fury that suggests they fear a teammate being shown a card. The referee, though, points for a Liverpool free-kick, which calms them down pretty fast. Keita had put an arm across Mount to protect the ball, and had made contact with the Chelsea player\u2019s chin, but with no obvious power or intent.    Updated at 5.00pm GMT    4.54pm    23 mins: More good pressure from Chelsea: Chalobah wins the ball from Diaz, and Alonso from Fabinho, and at the end of it Kante has a chance to shoot. The shot rolls limply wide.     4.53pm    22 min: Alexander-Arnold backheels for Salah, whose shot is poor and flies wide, curling ever wider.     4.52pm    21 mins: The ball is eventually played long down the left to Luis Diaz, whose first touch to bring it under control is insanely good. The move ends with a foul a few yards outside Chelsea\u2019s penalty area, and a shooting chance.      4.51pm    20 mins: Van Dijk has a moment on the ball without real pressure, and enjoys it so much he keeps it for a while, and then Fabinho and Matip do likewise.     4.49pm    18 mins: After messing up his last attempted cross, Alexander-Arnold\u2019s next effort is absolutely sublime, but Mane miscues his header.      4.48pm    17 mins: Havertz gets down the left again, but from his low cross both Mount and Kovacic have shots blocked. Then Mane beats Chalobah again, but Kante gets back to cut out the ensuing pass.     4.46pm    15 mins: Alexander-Arnold prepares to half-volley a cross with the outside of his right foot, notices there\u2019s nobody in the box to cross to, half pulls out of the cross and produces an embarrassingly useless pass to nobody.     4.44pm    13 mins: Thiago Silva is down, holding his right elbow. Turns out he\u2019s doing so to protect his left shoulder. The physios run on and hand him some kind of magic pill.     4.43pm    11 mins: Luis Diaz and Mane both successfully take on Trevoh Chalobah down the left in the space of a minute or two. Liverpool lose the ball as soon as they try to work it inside, but some encouragement there.   Updated at 4.48pm GMT    4.41pm    9 mins: Liverpool are still struggling to achieve anything, under constant pressure from Chelsea at both ends of the pitch - defenders constantly hassled, forwards under pressure the moment they receive the ball.     4.37pm    6 mins: What a chance for Chelsea! From a left-wing throw-in they play the ball across to the right - a lovely backheel flick from Kovacic along the way - from where Azpilicueta\u2019s low centre finds Pulisic unmarked on the six-yard line, but he sidefoots straight at Kelleher!   Updated at 4.51pm GMT    4.35pm    4 mins: Havertz has the ball in the middle with Alonso running to his left and Kante bombing through the middle. He misses the pass down the centre, and Alexander-Arnold beat Alonso to his ball out wide.     4.33pm    2 mins: Liverpool have had most of the ball in these opening exchanges, but with constant hounding from their opponents haven\u2019t been able to do much with it.     4.31pm    1 min: Peeeeeeep! The English League Cup final is under way!   Updated at 4.33pm GMT    4.30pm    The Thiago news is a serious blow for Liverpool. He is in tears on the bench, being consoled by Alisson.     4.26pm    The players are out, and the entire stadium is standing for a few moments in support of Ukraine.     4.25pm    Meanwhile the Telegraph is reporting that \u201ctrustees of Chelsea\u2019s charitable foundation have not yet agreed to Roman Abramovich\u2019s idea to hand them \u2018stewardship\u2019 of the club\u201d because \u201cthey have major unanswered questions\u201d and \u201cdo not want to act or be seen as a front\u201d.     4.23pm    Here\u2019s what Thomas Tuchel says about his decision to leave out Romelu Lukaku:  If you look at the history he starts a lot of matches, but today for us is a bit more about running, and running behind the line, and Kai, Christian and Mason are today, from a tactical point of view, a bit a better fit, and it\u2019s very nice to have Romelu off the bench to influence the game.      4.22pm    Thiago has been injured in the warm-up and can\u2019t play for Liverpool. Naby Keita comes in for him.     4.16pm    There look to be lots of Ukraine flags among Liverpool\u2019s supporters, while Chelsea are handing out blue-and-yellow signs to be held up by their fans, or at least those of them capable of the mental contortion involved in supporting both Chelsea and Ukraine\u2019s fight against Russia.       3.59pm    Here\u2019s Barney Ronay\u2019s pre-match preview thing:  And you shall know us by the trail of sponsors. The League Cup has always been a bird-on-a-wire kind of thing. Every year this fond old springtime ritual is menaced and marginalised and threatened with ever more imminent extinction, but still people keep turning up in February and March asking where the party is. The title branding tells a story of that picaresque progress. In the space of 40 years, English football\u2019s second-string domestic cup has gone from the quiet gravitas of being named after the entire Football League, through Coca-Cola, beer, electrical goods and the generic liquid \u201cmilk\u201d into a holding pattern of insurance and financial products and now on to its current iteration as the global face of Thailand\u2019s second-most popular energy drink. And still it marches on, enduringly popular with the people who actually go to watch and a genuinely mouthwatering prospect as Chelsea and Liverpool prepare to meet at Wembley on Sunday afternoon. This time around the headline branding looks spot-on. A perfect fit for a fizzy, colourful, fun kind of day, a little left-field but with its own peppy sense of fun; not to mention, on this occasion, a little caffeinated ignition. Not least for J\u00fcrgen Klopp\u2019s Liverpool, a great club team still in the process of writing their own story as a great club team, who really could do with winning this one.   Much more here:      3.50pm    It has been reported today that John Toshack, who scored 96 goals in 247 games for Liverpool between 1970 and 1977 and won three league titles, an FA Cup and a couple of Uefa Cups, and has gone on to manage an absolute shedload of clubs including Swansea and Real Madrid, is in intensive care in a Spanish hospital after contracting Covid 19. The liveblog\u2019s very best but almost completely irrelevant wishes go to him and his family.      3.35pm   The teams!  The teams have been announced and they look like this: Liverpool: Kelleher, Alexander-Arnold, Matip, Van Dijk, Robertson, Fabinho, Henderson, Thiago, Diaz, Salah, Mane. Subs: Alisson, Konate, Tsimikas, Milner, Keita, Oxlade-Chamberlain, Minamino, Jota, Origi.Chelsea: Mendy, Chalobah, Silva, Rudiger, Azpilicueta, Kante, Kovacic, Alonso, Mount, Havertz, Pulisic. Subs: Kepa, James, Sarr, Jorginho, Loftus-Cheek, Saul, Hudson-Odoi, Lukaku, Werner.Referee: Stuart Attwell.   Here\u2019s PA Media\u2019s take on the Liverpool line-up:  Liverpool duo Thiago Alcantara and Luis Diaz made their Carabao Cup debuts in the final against Chelsea at Wembley. Thiago was one of two changes from the midweek hammering of Leeds, with Caoimhin Kelleher resuming his place as goalkeeper in the cup competitions. It meant Mohamed Salah made only his third League Cup appearance in nearly five years, having lost his previous two appearances against Chelsea in September 2018 and Arsenal in October 2020. Diogo Jota was named on the bench after overcoming an ankle injury.       3.30pm   Hello world!  It\u2019s cup final day! Wembley is the venue as Liverpool, who have won this competition quite a lot (eight times, level at the top of the all-time table with Manchester City) if not for a decade, come up against the footballing wing of London-based charitable foundation (lol) Chelsea. Liverpool are the country\u2019s form team, with one draw (at Stamford Bridge, in their first game of 2022) and six wins in the league this calendar year, while Chelsea have only two league wins (and, to be fair, a Club World Cup) to their name since the end of 2021. Encouraging omen dept: there hasn\u2019t been a goalless draw between these teams in 39 meetings since 2008, when Liverpool\u2019s attack consisted of Ryan Babel, Dirk Kuyt and Peter Crouch so failing to score wasn\u2019t terribly surprising. Anyway, welcome! Here\u2019s some pre-match reading about Liverpool:  And here\u2019s some pre-match reading about Chelsea:   Updated at 3.51pm GMT "

                    "body": "It spoke volumes for the slog England and Italy produced on Saturday that, by the end, what did not happen seemed more telling than the little that did. England did not click in attack and did not create many clear chances; when that briefly changed, Raheem Sterling did not adjust in time to convert a cross from Reece James when gloriously positioned in front of goal. Sterling\u2019s miss jarred particularly in the aftermath, when a frustrated Gareth Southgate put it on the line that his supporting cast need to do more. England are too reliant on Sterling and Harry Kane for goals, he said, which presents an added layer of complication when one or both are misfiring. When the rarity of Kane\u2019s talent was put to him, the theme of absence dominated again. \u201cThe concern is if you don\u2019t have him for whatever reason,\u201d Southgate said.  In the event Kane came to harm, England would presumably soldier on with Tammy Abraham \u2013 although Southgate hardly glowed about the Roma player\u2019s performance at Molineux \u2013 or flirt with a false 9, perhaps Phil Foden. Kane will always provoke the most concern but the prospect of a spluttery Sterling scratched at a sore that has been developing elsewhere in England\u2019s attack. Southgate finds himself lighter on in-form alternatives out wide than he might have expected a year ago. Where England\u2019s attacking options were being feted as the most bountiful in the world, the number from whom he can reliably coax a tune has dwindled. Even though Sterling\u2019s place in the starting XI at the World Cup is virtually assured, notwithstanding some uncertainty over his status at Manchester City, most of those who could line up on the opposite flank, or even dislodge him, come with caveats and compromises. It raised an eyebrow to hear Southgate assert, without explicitly naming names, that Marcus Rashford and Jadon Sancho have \u201cgot a lot to do to get back in the squad\u201d. Only 11 months have passed since both players participated in the Euro 2020 final; Rashford is by some distance the third-highest scorer among England\u2019s probables and possibles while memories should stretch sufficiently to visualise Sancho, not called up since October, dovetailing beautifully with Kane and Sterling during some of the qualifiers for that competition.  Both struggled during an awful Manchester United season; Sancho\u2019s uptick in form towards the end of the campaign may give him greater hope of a recall but it is asking a lot for either to garner the momentum between August and October that may restore their international manager\u2019s confidence.  Of the others who may hold aspirations of dislodging this month\u2019s crop, Emile Smith Rowe cannot be discounted but needs to ally a repeat of his early-season form with a robustness that is not yet evident. Harvey Barnes has not kicked on since his debut in 2020 and Jesse Lingard\u2019s time has almost certainly passed. Callum Hudson-Odoi\u2019s next cap looks more likely to be for Ghana. Mason Greenwood is out of the picture. Suddenly the cupboard does not look as lavishly stocked and it increases the chances that Southgate will ultimately go with the group who have, by his own estimation, lacked sharpness during a slow-burning Nations League mini-series. He needs more from most of them. In recent days he has spoken in pointedly admiring terms of Mason Mount, often unprompted or in response to questions pushing competitors\u2019 claims.  Mount\u2019s versatility and tactical cuteness make him a manager\u2019s dream, even if he is less imposing on the ball than some. Southgate was delighted with his pressing from the No 10 position against Germany, where he felt Mount had nullified Joshua Kimmich, and the Italians; that looks like his eventual home, although he could be deployed in a narrow supporting role in a variant of 3-4-3. Assuming Southgate opts for a back four when England begin their Qatar 2022 campaign against Iran, that would leave a choice between Foden, Bukayo Saka, Jack Grealish and Jarrod Bowen for the other wide spot. The argument for Foden has possibly been improved by his own absence with Covid-19, given the paucity of England\u2019s offering, although there are still questions around where he fits in.   For his blend of defensive diligence, technical quality and attacking dynamism Saka ticks the most boxes: there is a sense he must impose himself more consistently, though, and it is worth noting three of his four international goals have come against Andorra and San Marino. Perhaps it is Bowen and Grealish who, set alongside each other, lay Southgate\u2019s conundrum barest. After Bowen performed respectably on his debut in Hungary, Southgate pointed out he had taken more shots than anyone else in the team. Assessing Grealish\u2019s much-anticipated start against Italy, he praised his ball-carrying qualities but observed they had only brought one goal attempt. Bowen has rough edges but is direct, sharp and, even if chances go astray, willing to come back for more. Could a path be opening up all the way into the starting lineup at Khalifa International Stadium?  \u201cI have had chances and been in positions where I am getting chances,\u201d he said of his nascent international career. \u201cIt\u2019s just about converting those chances and being really ruthless.\u201d If he goes one better against the Hungarians on Tuesday, his claim may become impossible to ignore. Bowen and Grealish spoke last week of the freedom Southgate affords them. Grealish could be seen drifting in front of his back four to take possession during Saturday\u2019s second half. That is yet to translate into fluidity and there are underlying factors beyond the wide men\u2019s varying merits: England would be so much slicker, for example, if their attackers could combine with at least one midfielder capable of taking possession on the half-turn and recycling it as quickly as their continental peers. But that situation will not change before November so the forwards must find a way to step up. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to start to spread that load,\u201d Southgate said of their goalscoring burden. That glut of wing talent must quickly become conspicuous by its end product, rather than its holes."

                    "body": "Every year the question is asked: what is the point of the FA Cup, why should we care? This is not the Premier League, with its slick production values, glamorous stars at every turn and sense of dramatic urgency. There\u2019s no great sense that it matters: you lose, you\u2019re out and it has no bearing on the race for fourth. You win the thing and your manager still gets sacked a few days or weeks or months later \u2013 between 2012 and 2018, Ars\u00e8ne Wenger was the only FA Cup-winning manager still to be in his job a year later. Yet it remains a tremendously democratic institution and, amid everything else \u2013 the landmark final, the money it diverts down the pyramid, the chance it offers smaller clubs for a day to mark indelibly in their history (the time we won at Burnley, the afternoon we drew with West Ham, the night we played at Everton \u2026), it offers a reminder of games that used to be. And for fans of a certain age, disillusioned by the transformation of clubs into commercial vehicles or tools of soft power, nostalgia may be the most important thing we have left: it\u2019s the only thing to look forward to \u2013 the past.  It was 44 years ago on Tuesday that Nottingham Forest claimed their first major trophy of the Brian Clough era, winning a League Cup final replay against Liverpool, the team they face in an FA Cup quarter-final on Sunday night. Getting to a replay had been a matter of some fortune. Forest were without three cup-tied players, including Peter Shilton, which meant a start in goal for Chris Woods who, at 18 years and 124 days, remains the youngest goalkeeper to play in a Wembley final. With Colin Barrett injured and John McGovern struggling through with a tight groin, Liverpool dominated but were thwarted by the brilliance of Woods. \u201cHe kept his cool,\u201d wrote John Lawson in the Nottingham Evening Post, \u201crevealed the immense natural talent that he possesses and stole the hearts of a Wembley crowd as well as headline acclaim.\u201d Before the replay at Old Trafford, Clough\u2019s assistant, Peter Taylor, took the squad to Scarborough, ostensibly to relax them, although the trip served a useful secondary function in helping him move some furniture up to an apartment he had bought there. Unorthodox, perhaps, but it stressed that Forest were outsiders, that they did things differently, that they were rebels against the establishment. Clough was somebody who always scorned tactical discussion, but it is remarkable how often at key moments he or Taylor would make a significant tweak. McGovern\u2019s groin was too sore to be risked and so he was replaced by John O\u2019Hare. That pushed John Robertson into a deeper role, giving Forest a more compact shape that helped cut off the supply to Kenny Dalglish, a cautious, patient approach that would offer the blueprint for the European success to come.  Woods made early saves from Phil Neal and Dalglish and Alan Kennedy had an effort ruled out for handball before Robertson got the only goal with a 53rd-minute penalty after Phil Thompson had tripped O\u2019Hare. It was, Thompson admitted, \u201ca professional foul\u201d, and today it would be a clear red card, but Liverpool were furious. \u201cI knew he was outside the area when I kicked him,\u201d Thompson said, while Tommy Smith dismissed the performance of the referee, Pat Partridge, as \u201cbloody ridiculous\u201d and suggested he \u201cshould be shot\u201d. The temptation is to see all this as another world, a knockabout place without VAR when nobody had heard the phrase \u201cdenying a goalscoring opportunity\u201d, when players acted as removal men and frustrated defenders could call for the assassination of referees without fearing some social media warrior might take them seriously, when Nottingham Forest could be a major club. But the modern game was beginning to emerge. As early as 1969, Maurice Edwards had written in the Derby Evening Telegraph of \u201ca super league within Division 1\u201d that was beginning to pull away from the rest.  There were no funds \u2013 hedge, sovereign wealth or public investment \u2013 and no oligarchs, but there was an awareness that as football\u2019s popularity grew and, thanks to Match of the Day and England\u2019s World Cup win, it became mass public entertainment, there was a risk that a self-perpetuating elite would emerge. Edwards was right. He named Liverpool, Leeds \u201cand others\u201d. If you assume by that he meant Arsenal, Everton and Manchester United, 30 of the next 35 league titles would be won by that five-team elite before Roman Abramovich\u2019s Chelsea broke the sequence. Of the other five, one was won by Aston Villa, in 1969 still the joint-third most successful side in English history; one by a Blackburn fuelled by the millions of Jack Walker; two by Derby, once under Clough and once in effect by the team he had left behind; and one by Forest. Clough\u2019s genius held off almost single-handed the emergence of an elite group of super-clubs for a decade.  Forest had no wealthy backers. In 1977, they were run by a committee headed by the chairman, Brian Appleby, a lawyer, and his deputy, Stuart Dryden, a sub-postmaster. Forest were constantly short of cash, which led to the gamble in 1979-80 on building the Executive Stand at a cost of \u00a32.5m. When the signings of Justin Fashanu, Peter Ward and Ian Wallace didn\u2019t work out, the repayments proved a crippling burden. The decline of Forest from European champions to top-six challengers in the 80s tends to be put down to Clough\u2019s falling out with Taylor, and that clearly was a major factor, but so, too, were basic issues of finance. Of course mistakes have been made, some of them major, and, of course, things might have been different had different decisions been taken, but Forest\u2019s post-Clough decline has essentially returned them to the status they held before he took over.  Their improvement under Steve Cooper has brought FA Cup wins over Arsenal and Leicester, already created memories that will be treasured by this generation, but Sunday is the reminder of another time, that more innocent age when one extraordinary manager could still hold back the tides of economic history."

                    "body": "Good morning.\nDonald Trump has been compelled to testify under oath by a congressional committee investigating the deadly attack on the US Capitol on January 6, which named the ex-president the \u201ccentral cause\u201d.\n\u201cWe have left no doubt \u2013 none \u2013 that Donald Trump led an effort to upend American democracy that directly resulted in the violence of January 6,\u201d said Bennie Thompson, chair of the committee, watched by police officers who defended the Capitol that day.\n\u201cHe tried to take away the voice of the American people in choosing their president and replace the will of the voters with his will to remain in power. He is the one person at the center of the story of what happened on January 6. So we want to hear from him.\u201d\nYesterday\u2019s House of Representatives select committee move may prove a largely symbolic gesture, given legislative time constraints before the midterms and Trump\u2019s probable legal resistance.\nTrump responded on his Truth Social platform but did not say whether he would comply. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t the Unselect Committee ask me to testify months ago?\u201d he wrote. \u201cWhy did they wait until the very end, the final moments of their last meeting? Because the committee is a total \u2018BUST\u2019.\u201d\n\n\u201cCan you believe I lost to this effing guy?\u201d said Trump a week after the 2020 presidential election was called in favor of Joe Biden, according to former White House aide Alyssa Farah. Yet at the same time, he attempted to undermine and change the results.\n\nSenator investigates Qatar link to $1.2bn Kushner property rescue\n\nA leading financial firm faces questions about whether Qatar was secretly involved in the $1.2bn rescue of a Fifth Avenue property owned by Jared Kushner\u2019s family while Kushner was serving in the White House.\nRon Wyden, the Oregon Democrat who leads the Senate finance committee, has given the chief executive of Toronto-based Brookfield Asset Management until 24 October to answer a series of questions about a 2018 deal in which Brookfield paid Kushner Companies for a 99-year lease on the family\u2019s marquee 666 Fifth Avenue property.\nWhen it was announced in August 2018, the rescue reportedly generated enough money for the Kushner family to pay $1.1bn of debt on the building and buy out a partner.\n\u201cI remain deeply concerned that funding from a foreign government was involved in the rescue of a Kushner-owned property while Jared Kushner was employed as a senior White House official closely involved in the formulation of US policy towards the Middle East,\u201d Wyden said.\n\n\u2018Committee stonewalled\u2019. Brookfield may have \u201cintentionally misled\u201d the public when it said that \u201cno Qatar-linked entity\u201d had been involved in the deal, according to Wyden. It has been alleged that Brookfield used a Qatari-backed fund to fund the transaction. A spokesperson for Brookfield did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Kushner could not immediately be reached for comment.\n\nFive people, including police officer, killed in North Carolina shooting\n\nA North Carolina mayor has announced that five people, including a police officer, were killed in a shooting in a residential area yesterday. Raleigh mayor Mary-Ann Baldwin told reporters that several people were shot on the Neuse River greenway trail around 5pm, and that the police department had told her the suspect had been \u201ccontained\u201d at a residence in the area.\nNumerous police vehicles and multiple ambulances had rushed to the Hedingham neighborhood starting in the late afternoon, and officers remained there for hours during an apparent hunt for the shooter. Details of what happened were still scant by early evening.\n\u201cState and local officers are on the ground and working to stop the shooter and keep people safe,\u201d governor Roy Cooper had tweeted shortly before 7pm ET.\n\nSource of the firearm used in shooting still unclear. The state has stronger gun laws than other southern states where people are allowed to buy and carry firearms without a permit. In North Carolina, prospective buyers are required to pass background checks before they buy a handgun.\n\nRussia to evacuate Kherson, which could become frontline\n\nMoscow has announced it will evacuate Kherson after an appeal from the Russian-installed head of the region, raising fears the occupied city at the heart of the south Ukrainian oblast will become a new frontline.\nMarat Khusnullin, a Russian deputy prime minister, told state television that residents would be helped to move away from the region, which remains only partly occupied by invading troops because of a successful Ukrainian counterattack in recent months.\n\u201cThe government took the decision to organise assistance for the departure of residents of the [Kherson] region to other regions of the country,\u201d Khusnullin said.\nIt comes after a public request by Volodymyr Saldo, a former mayor of the port city, who was installed in April by the Russian forces as head of the wider Kherson region, imploring Vladimir Putin to help those who wished to flee the fighting, claiming Ukrainian attacks were imperilling the lives of local people.\n\nSaldo, who was mayor of Kherson city between 2002 and 2012, said: \u201cWe, residents of the Kherson region, certainly know that Russia does not abandon its own, and Russia always lends a shoulder where it is difficult.\u201d\n\nIn other news \u2026\n\n\nDissidents in China detained and harassed as Beijing prepares for party congress. Authorities have stepped up surveillance of government critics as part of a crackdown on dissent before the Communist party\u2019s 20th congress, its key twice-a-decade political gathering.\n\n\n\nDutch crown princess moves out of student flat after security threats. Catharina-Amalia, 18, has moved to the royal palace after threats to her security, amid reported fears that criminal gangs may target her for kidnapping or an attack.\nBankers\u2019 bonuses in the UK have doubled since the 2008 financial crash, according to research by the unions\u2019 umbrella body that accuses the government of enriching City financiers while suppressing the pay of key workers.\nElon Musk is under a federal investigation related to his $44bn takeover of Twitter, the social media company said in a court filing made public yesterday. Twitter, which sued Musk in July to force him to close the deal, said his attorneys had claimed \u201cinvestigative privilege\u201d when refusing to hand over documents.\n\nStat of the day: 70.8bn tonnes of east Antarctic glacier melts a year\n\nResearchers from Australia\u2019s national science agency have said the Denman ice shelf in remote east Antarctica could be at risk of unstable retreat as it melts at a rate of 70.8bn tonnes a year because of an ingress of warm sea water. It was thought east Antarctica would not experience the same rapid ice loss that is occurring in the west but some recent studies have shown warm water is reaching that part of the continent, too.\nMelting of the floating part of the glacier does not add to sea level rise, writes Lisa Cox, but as the ice shelf becomes thinner or weaker it provides less resistance to the flow of ice from Antarctica into the ocean. \u201cOne of the take-home messages is when we\u2019re looking at how much sea level is going to rise into the future, we do need to take east Antarctica into account, as well as west Antarctica,\u201d said Steve Rintoul, one of the paper\u2019s authors.\nDon\u2019t miss this: I broke every bone in my face\n\n\u201cOne evening, the three of us were chilling on the balcony of my apartment, then my brothers went to bed,\u201d Justin Starks tells Daniel Dylan Wray. \u201cFrom then on, I don\u2019t know what happened. I remember waking up in a hospital and being told I had fallen off our 30ft (nine-metre) balcony. I can remember my life about 30 minutes before the fall, but nothing after that. A lot of people say: \u2018Oh my God, that must be the most painful experience imaginable,\u2019 but I don\u2019t remember.\n\u201cWhen I regained consciousness, my main concern was for my twin brother because I wasn\u2019t sure if he knew what had happened to me \u2013 he might have thought I was dead. I didn\u2019t have my phone on me, but the hospital called him. I later found out that he had seen my body on the ground. Someone on the ground floor had heard the impact of my fall and called the paramedics.\u201d\nClimate check: Egypt \u2018silenced\u2019 critical voices before Cop27\n\nEgypt\u2019s independent environmentalists have been neutralised before the country hosts this year\u2019s UN climate talks, the environment director at Human Rights Watch has said. Richard Pearshouse said a failure to address abuses by Egypt and other authoritarian regimes would hold back the introduction of the forward-thinking climate policies needed to move away from dirty energy and rein in the climate crisis, in an interview with Nina Lakhani.\n\u201cIt will be a fundamental mistake if diplomats go to Cop27 thinking they need to go softly-softly on human rights in order to make progress in the climate talks,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will not get the urgent climate action needed without civil society pressure, the situation in Egypt shows us that.\u201d\nLast Thing: the many mysteries of the magic mushroom\n\nThe time of year when not-your-average ramblers can be seen hunting for a natural \u2013 if illegal \u2013 high across the northern hemisphere is upon us once more, writes Ed Douglas. \u201cAs is usually the case at this time of year, in among the ovine poo were some familiar mushrooms: purple russulas, ones to avoid, puffballs, and the spindly stem and Phrygian cap of Psilocybe semilanceata, or the magic mushroom,\u201d he recounts of a hike in Eyam Moor, nestled in middle England.\n\u201cMagic mushrooms do particularly well on sheep pasture, thriving on all that manure and the nitrogen in sheep urine. But is it a two-way street? Some mushrooms are toxic to sheep just as they are to humans. The sheep don\u2019t know this, though, and tiny magic mushrooms must be hard to avoid. Watching the sheep grazing peacefully, I wondered how you would know a sheep was tripping? Do they have visions? Are there shaman sheep?\u201d\nSign up\n\nFirst Thing is delivered to thousands of inboxes every weekday.

                    "body": "One of the toughest aspects of building a new year fitness habit is finding the time. Even in our hybrid-working world, it can feel like carving out just 30 minutes a couple of times a week is an impossible ask. But everyone has five minutes: it\u2019s about a third as long as people spend looking for something to watch on Netflix. And although five minutes might not seem like much, if you keep your efforts focused, you will start to see results \u2013 as well as building the foundations of a longer-term habit. So pick an area to work on and get the egg timer going. Posture Desk jobs tend to build bad posture, and not everything you do in the gym will help \u2013 the typical \u201cbench bro\u201d routine can lead to a forward hunch that will set you up for problems down the line. \u201cPosture is really about back strength,\u201d says Helen O\u2019Leary, a physiotherapist and clinical pilates instructor. \u201cThe more the muscles in the back of your body work, the more they will hold you up against gravity.\u201d Use these three movements in a circuit, doing each once. Prone press\u201cA great mobility and prep exercise to start with at the end of your day,\u201d says O\u2019Leary. \u201cLie on your stomach with your hands by your chest and your nose hovering above the floor. \u201cPress your pubic bone into the floor to create a stable base. Press down into your hands and imagine you are pressing the floor away \u2013 this will start to send your upper back off the floor. Pause with your lowest ribs on the floor, take a breath and then lower back down. As you improve, try lifting your hands at the top of the movement to see if you can hold yourself up.\u201d  Pilates swimming\u201cVery much a progression of the prone press \u2013 this will test your endurance as well as your core control,\u201d says O\u2019Leary. \u201cStart as before, this time reaching your arms and legs away from each other as if you\u2019re being pulled apart in a tug of war. You should end up with both feet and hands off the floor. Pause when you are here, and make sure you are breathing \u2013 then start to \u2018paddle\u2019 the arms and legs from the shoulder and hip socket. Your body will rotate a little and this is totally fine. Ideally, build the length of time you are up towards 60 seconds.\u201d Single leg kick\u201cIt\u2019s great for posture, but this movement also includes strength work around your shoulders, and will mobilise your spine,\u201d says O\u2019Leary. \u201cPlus, your legs get involved, making it an all-in exercise. Lie on your front and press yourself up on to your elbows to make a triangle shape with your forearms, with your hands still slightly apart. Press down into your pubic bone and extend and raise one leg away from you so that it starts to hover off the floor from your lower thigh onwards. Now try to keep that leg off the floor as you start to draw a long arc upwards and outwards with your toes, bending the knee as you do. Again, keep the thigh off the floor and extend the leg out behind you before lowering it to the floor. Repeat five times on each leg, if you can.\u201d Core strength  This is important for everyday life, but tackling it the old-school way \u2013 with hundreds of momentum-heavy sit-ups \u2013 isn\u2019t efficient. Instead, remember that the real purpose of your core muscles is to keep you braced, whether you are carrying the shopping or doing a parallel turn on the ski slopes \u2013 so you need to focus on slow, controlled movements that will help them do their job. Do each of the three exercises below for 40 seconds, rest for 10-20 seconds, and repeat. Crunch\u201cAlthough it\u2019s an old exercise, when performed with correct form, the standard crunch is great, as it activates nearly all the muscles of the core,\u201d says the personal trainer Jacqui Ward. \u201cLie on your back, keeping your knees bent and feet flat on the floor, making sure your lower back is also pressed into the floor. Engage your abdominal muscles to lift your head and shoulders off the floor. I like to increase the time under tension, while at the top part of the crunch, by pausing for a second, and then slowly lowering back to the floor with control, keeping those abs contracted. If you really must put your hands behind your head, don\u2019t pull on your head or neck.\u201d  Bicycle crunch\u201cAgain, technique is everything on this movement,\u201d says Ward. \u201cGet into a regular crunch position, then lift both legs off the ground. Lift your right shoulder toward your left knee and simultaneously extend your right leg, then repeat on the opposite side without pausing. Make sure to move slowly and emphasise muscle contraction to get the most out of the exercise.\u201d This emphasises your obliques more than the standard crunch, so it\u2019s worth doing both.  Side plank raise\u201cA side plank is a great movement, as it will show up any imbalances between your two sides,\u201d says Ward. \u201cTo start, lie on your side with one forearm on the ground, your hand slightly in front of your shoulder. Put your top leg either in front or on top of the \u2018grounded\u2019 leg. As you exhale, push into your hand and feet, and lift your hips up until you are in a diagonal line. Drop your hips down, then press into your hand and feet and lift your hips back up so that they are almost in line with your shoulder. Repeat this movement, slow and controlled rather than bouncing, for 20 seconds on each side \u2013 if it\u2019s tough on your wrist, press your fingers into the floor and create a little dome in your palm.\u201d Mobility  Whether you\u2019re a runner who doesn\u2019t do much else, or an avid gamer who only has time to stretch during the loading screens, a little goes a long way when it comes to mobility exercises. For an all-round hit, try the \u201cslow burpee\u201d, which engages almost every muscle you have. Start standing with your feet just outside shoulder width apart, then squat down, placing your hands between your legs. Walk your hands out into a push-up position, directly under your shoulders. Do one push up, then reverse the movement, stand up, breathe and repeat. Do them ladder-style: one rep, one breath, two reps, two breaths \u2026 up to five or 10.  Strength It\u2019s tough to build real strength doing five minutes a day \u2013 Olympic weightlifters will often rest for up to five minutes between heavy sets \u2013 but if you want to make a start in the time you have, try staying still. \u201cIn that kind of time frame with no equipment, isometrics [the tightening of a specific muscle or group of muscles] aren\u2019t a bad option,\u201d says strength coach Joseph Lightfoot. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to warm up much, and there\u2019s basically no risk of injury.\u201d Pair the movements below a couple of times a week. Press-up holdStarting from a high plank (ie as if you were at the top of a press-up), lower yourself until your elbows are bent to a roughly 90\u2013degree angle, then hold for 30-60 seconds. Keep your elbows tucked to your body and your body plank-straight \u2013 this will also build core strength.  Squat holdsSquat down until your upper thighs are parallel to the floor and hold the position for 30-60 seconds, keeping your torso upright and head high. Too easy? Move on to the single leg squat hold by putting one leg behind you, keeping your trailing knee hovering just above the floor, without putting the foot to the ground. Hip flexibility For anyone who is not particularly active, building flexibility and mobility around the hips is key: it\u2019s the biggest bang for your buck in terms of improving overall quality of life. \u201cJust a few simple hip-openers can improve the external rotation of the femur bone in the hip socket and improve your flexibility,\u201d says Helen Gaunt, an elite runner and personal trainer. \u201cUse these three for 45-60 seconds each \u2013 or on each side \u2013 and try to do them a few times a week.\u201d  Bound angle poseYou may also know this one as the butterfly stretch: it\u2019s great for the inner thigh muscles, or adductors. In a seated position, bring the flats of the feet together, holding them in your hands with your knees out to the sides. Inhale and then exhale, dropping your shoulders as you push your knees downwards towards the ground, keeping your head tall, and back straight. This can also be done against a wall for support \u2013 or leaning forwards, pushing the elbows down on to your thighs. Figure of fourLie on the floor facing upwards, lift both legs and bend them, keeping one foot on the floor and bringing the other ankle across to rest against the opposite knee \u2013 you should feel a slight stretch in that leg. Lace your hands behind the thigh of the non-stretching leg and pull it towards you to increase the stretch, but not so much that it\u2019s uncomfortable. Hold, then repeat on the other side.  Child\u2019s poseFinish with this relaxing hip-opener position. Kneeling with your knees open and your feet together, hinge at the hips, lowering your upper body forwards, bringing your head down towards the floor and reaching your arms forwards to stretch out the upper back. Hold for at least 60 seconds, inhaling and exhaling slowly and deeply, releasing and loosening the hips and pelvis to improve range of movement. Fat loss The four-minute Tabata intervals workout programme beloved of gym classes is slightly overrated: in the studies that showed its effectiveness, professional athletes warmed up for 20 minutes before even starting the protocol, and did their sets at 170% of VO2 max (100% of V02 max is often \u201cassociated with complete exhaustion and/or vomiting\u201d). Still, if time is short and you\u2019re aiming to burn some fat, one move beats all the others: a Louisiana University study that compared kettlebell swings, cleans and deadlifts to a more traditional sprint training programme found that calorie expenditure was biggest with the bells.   To master the kettlebell swing, stand with your feet just outside shoulder-width and the kettlebell hanging from both hands. Bend your knees and hinge your hips slightly, then snap your hips forward, using the momentum to swing the bell upward. Weight-wise, don\u2019t go too light; if you can use your arms to do the reps, you can go heavier."

                    "body": "  9.56pm    Thank you so much for joining me for this stunning and scintillating match. The Arnold Clark Cup and a first home win against Germany bagged for England. Germany put up a great fight but in the end England managed to claim the win, albeit with Bright\u2019s goal being offside. If you want to recap all the action from the match, read Suzy Wrack\u2019s report here.     9.49pm    I didn\u2019t notice it at the time but Bright was actually offside for her goal. There isn\u2019t any VAR in the match and so England got away with that. Ian Wright has made a good point as the assistant referee was perfectly line up and should have spotted the error.   Updated at 9.58pm GMT    9.47pm    England manager Sarina Wiegman told ITV: \u201cThe tournament was as we expected, three top level games. We have seen different players and starting line-ups. We have seen different style. \u201cToday we weren\u2019t tight enough but then you have to be compact as a team. \u201cWhen I came in this team had a lot of experience. The eagerness to commitment and wanting to learn is immense. It has been a pleasure so far. \u201cYou want to keep all the players fit and in form at their clubs. Other teams progress too so it\u2019s hard to predict [Euros outcome].\u201d     9.44pm    Wiegman remains undefeated as England boss and has shown her brilliance with those late subs and formation changes. So many people were questioning putting Bright up front in the closing moments of the match but it paid off massively. It\u2019ll be interesting to see what the manager says, she should be facing the press shortly.     9.40pm    Yellow streamers drown the England team as they raise their arms and the crowd goes wild. A great moment for the team who have struggled for form over the past few years. Wiegman has done unbelievably well since taking the helm in 2021.   Updated at 9.56pm GMT    9.37pm    Millie Bright and Alexia Putellas have posed for a picture with the golden boot, both scoring two goals in three games. The breakthrough star of the tournament has been named as Spain\u2019s Athenea del Castillo - very much deserved. England players are putting medals around each other\u2019s neck ahead of the trophy lift.     9.35pm    It\u2019s worth remembering how close this tournament was, England have won this cup on goal difference. The only side not to claim a win was Germany and Canada and Spain only bagged a victory each. This sets up such an exciting stage for the Euros! Trophy ceremony to come ...     9.32pm    Player of the Match Millie Bright told ITV: \u201cIt\u2019s brilliant. For us in the past it was a rocky road, for us to finally be on a journey together we are on the right road. \u201cThis is just the beginning. It wasn\u2019t pretty out there but it\u2019s another element to our game that we can win dirty. \u201cWe\u2019re not bothered who scores, it\u2019s just about getting it in the back of the net. \u201cWe have shown that we can win\u201d     9.30pm    While the concentration and talk will be around England because of the dramatic late win, props need to be given to Germany. They came into this tournament without 12 players due to injury and Covid. They held Spain to a draw, lost 1-0 to Canada and suffered a late defeat to England. And my, oh my Magull\u2019s strike is something so promising for the visitors. Imagine Magull at the Euros when all of their star players return. The Euros are going to be amazing.     9.28pm    Take a look at the England goals which sealed the win:       9.25pm    England are screaming and hugging each other, such wholesome scenes! Bright, Player of the Match, embraced Sarina Wiegman and you can just see what it means to them.     9.23pm   Full-time: England 3-1 Germany  England have won the Arnold Clark Cup and defeated Germany for the first time at home. A great strike from White in the first match was cancelled out by arguably the goal of the tournament from Magull. The second half saw both teams playing well with shots coming in. But it was England\u2019s Bright who broke the deadlock and Kirby added the extra. A breath-taking match, I am so excited for the Euros!  Updated at 9.26pm GMT    9.22pm    Kirby makes a sensational break and just kept going. And going. And going! She smacks it home and seals a cracking match.    Updated at 10.03pm GMT    9.22pm   GOAL! England 3-1 Germany (Kirby, 90+3')  Wow, this is why Kirby should be at 1o     9.19pm    90 + 2 min: There are three minutes added to this match. Germany look desperate to keep England to two goals as Russo and Hemp look to shoot. The defence does enough to quell the danger     9.17pm    90 min: Player of the Match has been confirmed as Millie Bright. The defender has played well in defence and came through for England when they needed her.  She\u2019s also the joint top tournament scorer with Spain\u2019s Alexia Putellas.     9.16pm    88 min: England look to get a third as Hemp passes to Kirby but German shirts swarm. The visitors look to equalise one again, Rall is doing so well to battle with Kirby. The Chelsea star, though, ends up on the better end and wins a free kick. Germany make a change as Buhl comes off for Cerci. What a match this has been!     9.14pm    86 min: It\u2019s interesting to note that was one of the many runs Hemp made where she kept her head up. Emma Hayes mentioned the Manchester City star didn\u2019t have enough awareness but she seemed to get it just in time. What a finish from Bright as well! The camera has panned to Spain who are not happy with that score.     9.13pm   GOAL! England 2-1 Germany (Bright, 84')  England are so intent on finding a winner they have left Bright up front. And what a decision that is! A cracking ball from Hemp sees Bright tap home.     Updated at 10.01pm GMT    9.11pm    84 min: Hemp thumps the ball upfield as England throw everything at Germany to try and find a winner. But it\u2019s the visitors who look dangerous, Brand almost scores from a cracking header. This is so tense!     9.10pm    82 min: Williamson takes a shot and the attempt sails way over the bar. Possession pinballs around the midfield and it ends in a break in play. England take the opportunity to bring Russo and Toone on for White and Bronze.     9.08pm    80 min: We are back, I have a feed back up and running! England have a free kick and Kirby takes it. Bright gets a head to it but it goes wide. Wow, what a stressful few minutes!     9.06pm    75 min: I apologise for the lack of on pitch updates, the ITV Hub has decided to have a meltdown and Twitter is raging about it! According to my Twitter sources, Germany were pinging the ball in the box but couldn\u2019t quite get a shot away. England countered as Kirby saw a shot rattle the woodwork. Russo on shortly.     9.01pm    71 min: Neither side are yet to find a winner and Germany are the first to bring on their next changes. Hagel and Dallmann are on for Dongus and Magull. Interesting move taking Magull off. The goal-scorer and such a bright spark to this second half.     8.59pm    69 min: Alessia Russo is said to be warming up and will be the next England change. It will be interesting to see (if ITV wants to get their Hub back up and running) how she goes as she hasn\u2019t had the best tournament.     8.55pm    66 min: England are on the attack once again with Daly smashing a great ball in. It just beats White as the hosts look to put themselves ahead once again. I\u2019m relieved and frustrated to update you that it isn\u2019t my internet causing the issue with my feed, it\u2019s ITV Hub cutting out. I\u2019m hoping it\u2019s because so many fans are trying to watch the match. If you want to vent Hub frustrations to me, I\u2019m all ears! Email or send me a tweet!     8.52pm    64 min: A heavy challenge comes in as Hemp and Gwinn collide. The England star looks in pain, let\u2019s hope she is okay! She is on her feet and is staying on the pitch. My feed has decided to cut again, the joy. I\u2019ll be all over any updates while my laptop decides to play ball though!      8.49pm    62 min: It was a solid cross from Stanway but it pings back out to Bronze. Her cross doesn\u2019t have an affect. But Hemp is with the ball again and this time shoots, it\u2019s saved by Frohms and she was offside anyway. England make their first change as Stanway comes off for Parris.     8.48pm    60 min: Hemp is great at dribbling the ball around the box but she needs to shoot! She\u2019s in a great position but gets caught in two minds and doesn\u2019t pull the trigger. She makes up for it by winning a free kick. Stanway on the kick again ...     8.46pm    58 min: Brand concedes a free kick with a foul on Walsh. The kick goes to Bronze but her pass is cut out.  This is turning into a slightly sloppy performance from England now. Germany are really building and the mistakes are seeping into the Lionesses game. This may be the brightest Germany has played this tournament.     8.44pm    56 min: Williamson this time the one to lose the ball in the midfield but Bronze does well to get back to clear. England counter well with Hemp crossing to White but Feldkamp shuts down the attack - a great defensive move.     8.42pm    53 min: Bronze has a sloppy pass and it would have seen Buhl away but the German stops as she fouls Bronze. A lucky escape for England. Walsh passes sublime ball to Hemp who wins a corner. Stanway plays it short and low which is easy to read from Germany. Interesting the Lionesses have switched who takes the kick. Greenwood had been the taker.     8.40pm    51 min: Dongus\u2019 pass goes straight out after impressive play from goal-scorer Magull. England look to build but they spill the ball in Germany\u2019s half, a dangerous spell here for the hosts. Brand gets it into the box but a sloppy pass sees England full of relief.     8.38pm    49 min: Bronze does excellently as Germany look to shoot in a great position. She calmly intercepts the ball. Buhl has had a bright game so far and continues to be a big threat.     8.35pm    47 mins: What a fun fact, England have never drawn three consecutive matches in their international history. Hemp looks to break but it just gets away from her. Williamson gets the ball and the crowd encourages her to shoot, she doesn\u2019t. It\u2019s a high tempo star with only one change at half-time with Brand on for Germany.  Updated at 8.36pm GMT    8.33pm    We are back underway. England need to score again in order to win the Arnold Clark Cup. If Germany hold them to a draw or bag a win, the cup will go to Spain. In other news, did I grab another Skittles bag in the break? Maybe I did, maybe I didn\u2019t.     8.20pm    Here\u2019s a look at Magull\u2019s sensational strike!      8.18pm   Half-time: England 1-1 Germany  As I said before the game, don\u2019t count out Germany. White scored a beautiful opener after sustained England pressure. The hosts continued to impress and an error from Greenwood led to a German freekick. Magull then struck the perfect freekick, it superbly curled into goal with Roebuck able to do little to stop it. We are all square!     8.16pm    45 +1 min: England are retaining possession here, maybe running down the clock? There are two minutes added. Feel like my stress levels are back to normal now, phew the panic when my feed cut was very real!     8.15pm    44 min: My feed is back, huzzah! Gutted I missed that goal in real time, it was an absolute stunner. The equaliser means as things stand, Spain will win the tournament.     8.12pm    From Twitter sources it seems Greenwood was booked, giving Germany a free kick. Magull curled the shot straight into goal, now we have a match on our hands!     8.12pm   GOAL! England 1-1 Germany (Magull, 43')  Don\u2019t you just love it when the feed cuts and a goal is scores, I know I do!    Updated at 8.31pm GMT    8.10pm    39 min: Another mistake from Kirby in the midfield, unlike the Chelsea star. A pass gets away from her to gift the ball to Germany. Walsh wrestles the ball back, who passes to Greenwood and she sends it upfield. Hemp clatters to the floor to earn a free kick in scoring distance.  Greenwood takes the kick and just as she does my feed on ITV Hub cuts out. Just what I need!      8.06pm    36 min: Dabritz, what a mistake! She nabs the ball after Kirby\u2019s pass is loose in the midfield.  The German captain makes a great run but doesn\u2019t get it away to a teammate and Bright runs her off the pitch. England counter and White is almost through to double the lead.     8.04pm    34 min: Magull dribbles the ball around the top of the box and feeds Rall. She takes a shot but Roebuck calmly collects. Carter is receiving more treatment, surely she is coming off here? Yeah she is, Daly on in her place.  Updated at 8.05pm GMT    8.02pm    32 min: A lot of play in the midfield with possession exchanging hands. Carter looks to be suffering from that earlier clash, will keep you up to date on if she is taken off.     8.00pm    29 min: A clever play started by Rall sees Germany in the box for some time. Unfortunately for Germany, England manage to get the ball away. The match has so much tempo but some passes need to be more clinical for both sides.     7.57pm    27 min: Oh Stanway what a goal that would have been. White has a great pass and it looks like a bicycle kick from Stanway.  Frohms makes a cracking save to limit England\u2019s lead. Hemp wins a free kick from England\u2019s half, seeing the Lionesses build again from deep.     7.55pm    25 min: Roebuck almost loses control of the ball in front of goal but she manages to scoop it up. A shaky start from the Manchester City keeper so far. Bright gifts away a throw in to halt Germany attack. Gwinn takes the throw but England clear. Hemp now on the run who passes to Carter. The Chelsea star\u2019s pass isn\u2019t good and it goes all the way back to Roebuck.     7.53pm    22 min: The game has wound down slightly with Carter down with injury. She got back to her feet and will play on.  With the lull in the game, a recap of where we are at in the worst to best Skittles debate. We are now on yellow, green, orange, red and purple. Let me know your thoughts! An England corner sees Greenwood cross in but it goes to nothing.  Updated at 7.58pm GMT    7.50pm    20 min: Bronze concedes a corner after great play from Gwinn. Buhl takes the kick but England clear well. The ball then pinballs around the box and eventually get it away. This game is full throttle!      7.49pm    18 min: As things stand England will win the tournament on yellow cards but Germany aren\u2019t going to lay down and let the hosts take a win. The goal hasn\u2019t shaken the visitors but they will have to do something to stop the momentum soon.     7.47pm    Kirby tries to get a shot away but Germany tap it back. The lack of power on the clearance meant Kirby could pass to White who splices it home. Are England on their way to a first home win against Germany?     7.46pm   GOAL! England 1-0 Germany (White, 15')  Finally England get their opener, a great team goal!     Updated at 8.32pm GMT    7.44pm    14 min: Hemp holds onto the ball in the final third a touch too long to silence a deadly attack. And Greenwood puts a delightful pass in but again England spill the attack. This must be frustrating for England fans to watch. The German defensive wall holds strong though and the visitors look to counter.     7.42pm    12 min: Bronze deals well with a slow build from Germany, the pressure from the visitors is brilliant. Williamson concedes a corner and Buhl takes the kick. Rall gets a head to the cross but Roebuck jumps on it. Roebuck gets herself out of trouble as a pass from goal goes loose. She smothers the ball heading back to goal.     7.40pm    9 min: Carter did well to win a throw in as Germany players swarm the ball.  Germany start to counter but Walsh intercepts the ball and look to build from deep. A great start from England so far.     7.38pm    7 min: As Rall clears a great Greenwood pass, we have had more opinions on Skittles. Courtney has tweeted me: \u201cOrange deserves to be higher up that list.\u201d I don\u2019t think I would be mad if orange rose in the ranks, anything but the yellow.     7.36pm    5 min: Is there anything Hemp can\u2019t do? Every time she has played for England this tournament she has made great breaks. Her danger is dealt with well though Buhl. The hosts wins a free kick, Greenwood takes the set-piece but it goes to nothing. Rall looks to counter but Roebuck collects. Lively exchanges!     7.33pm    2 min: The Skittles debate is raging on and I have received a controversial comment. Daniel reached out via Twitter and said: \u201cI\u2018m very uncouth and just bundle a lot in and snaffle them down, so I don\u2019t really know if yellow ones are gross or not. I hate yellow Starburst and Fruit Gums though.\u201d I feel you need to do a taste test Daniel to see if your hate for yellow sweets extends to Skittles. An interesting experiment. Back to the football, England have started brightly!     7.31pm   Kick-off: England 0-0 Germany  I think this is the loudest crowd yet, huge applause and cheers for both teams! The anthems ring out and the players discard their jumpers. Here we go!   Updated at 7.48pm GMT    7.25pm    Earlier I said I was unsure who would win the tournament if England beat Germany 1-0 and pick up three yellow cards, I now have the answer - England and Spain would share the trophy. I don\u2019t know how to feel about a shared win if I\u2019m honest The players are about to come out onto the pitch with anthems to follow. Kick-off isn\u2019t far away ...     7.17pm    I am grateful to share I am not the only person who hates yellow Skittles, our very own Suzy Wrack has told me she tolerates them. Suzy went a step further and ordered them worst to best, I can\u2019t say I disagree with her. Yellow, Orange, Green, Red, Purple.  I will welcome, and challenge, any other orders or opinions on Skittles. Email me or send me a tweet @rendellx.     7.12pm    The stats are ever in Germany\u2019s favour ahead of this clash. The visitors have played England 26 times and they have only lost once. On top of that, Germany have never lost to England away from home. It\u2019s an astonishing achievement and they will look to maintain it. Kick-off in just over 15 minutes.     7.07pm    If anyone was intrigued by what snack I landed on, I went with Skittles. The only issue is I hate the yellow ones. Does anyone else share my disgust? Anyway, back to the task in hand, we are just over 20 minutes away from kick-off. Can England take the trophy? Or will Germany halt the celebrations? Get in touch and let me know.     6.59pm    I believe this is the first Arnold Clark Cup match England have played without a storm going on. First it was Eunice, then Franklin.  The weather isn\u2019t much brighter but at least it\u2019s not gale force winds and rain!   Updated at 7.45pm GMT    6.53pm    England manager Sarina Wigeman told ITV: \u201cAs we said we play three games, we will try some things. A lot of players will get minutes and after this tournament we will have a lot of information. \u201cIt is very competitive [in goal]. At the moment Mary is our first choice keeper.\u201d     6.48pm    Considering how injury hit Germany\u2019s team was heading into this tournament, they have played extremely well and it won\u2019t do England any favours if they under-estimate them. They were able to claim a late equaliser against Euros favourites Spain and just lost 1-0 to Canada. We have quite the match on our hands.     6.40pm    The biggest surprise for me there was Hannah Hampton\u2019s change. I know I should have seen it coming with the goalkeepers changing every match but Hampton did fantastically well on her debut last time out. Before the tournament decider gets underway I\u2019m going to raid my snacks cupboard, I\u2019m thinking maybe some Skittles or crisps. Do you have a go to snack for football? Let me know be emailing me or dropping me a tweet @rendellx! I\u2019ve also gone rogue and made myself a coffee past 6.30pm. Will I regret this later? More than likely.  Updated at 6.41pm GMT    6.36pm    England have made six changes following their draw with Spain and it sees Leah Williamson handed back the captaincy. England\u2019s starting XI is: Roebuck, Walsh, Greenwood, Bright, Kirby, Williamson, White, Hemp, Bronze, Stanway, Carter Substitutes: Earps, Daly, Stokes, Toone, Hampton, Mead, Parris, Nobbs, Charles, Scott, Russo, Zelem Germany have made five changes from their loss to Canada. Their starting 11 is: Frohms, Rall, Feldkamp, Kleinherne, Gwinn, Dongus, Dabritz, Magull, Anyomi, Schuller, Buhl They haven\u2019t released a list of substitutes but I will try and track them down.     6.30pm    Preamble Welcome back to the Arnold Clark Cup and we return with its concluding match. England take on Germany and the hosts have the potential to win the tournament if they can limit their disciplinaries and claim victory over their opponents. England are currently third and but with Spain beating Canada 1-0 earlier today, the Lionesses could take the crown. Germany, meanwhile, are unable to win after a draw and a loss so far in the competition. So how can England win? This is where it gets complicated ... If England beat Germany 1-0 and only get two disciplinaries they win. If they beat Germany and score more than two goals they win. I\u2019m unsure how the tournament would be decided if England beat Germany 1-0 and pick up three disciplinaries as they would then be all square with Spain. But we will cross that bridge if it comes to it! Both England and Germany will release their starting XI\u2019s shortly for the 7.30pm kick-off, so stay tuned.  "

                    "body": "For the last few weeks Paris has been gripped by stories of superstar players wanting to leave this place. For an hour at the Parc des Princes it was easy to sympathise, as a Paris Saint-Germain team with Neymar and Lionel Messi installed as a walking-football front two produced a horribly constipated performance en route to a 1-0 defeat by Bayern Munich that threatens to deadhead their season before the end of February. The emir of Qatar was in Paris to watch this last-16 first leg, hotfooting it from Rome, and perhaps, who knows, with half an eye on opportunities in the north-west of England. There has been some unease in Paris about the interest in Manchester United. The Elon Musk blather, the Saudi chat may all sound a little far-fetched. But the emir, well, he definitely does like buying stuff. Presumably he will have at least woken up for the final half-hour, where the arrival of Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 injected life and pace into this blue-shirted star vehicle. Otherwise PSG looked like an imitation of a team here, outplayed for long periods by a neat and competent Bayern.  Le Parisien had billed this match as \u201cLe Grand Soir\u201d. And it is basically the season for PSG, a year of the project, ready to do or die once again across 180 minutes of knockout football. The Parc des Princes was a thunderous place at kick-off, although as ever with a sense of being en f\u00eate, of lots of people basically singing and dancing next to a football match. Bayern went with a back three from the start, an ambitious shape that meant Kingsley Coman taking a turn as an attacking left wing-back. For PSG Mbapp\u00e9 was, as promised (by the man himself), on the bench despite a thigh injury. Warren Za\u00efre-Emery, a 16-year-old from the banlieues, started in midfield for the biggest game of the year. It says a great deal for this club that it was Za\u00efre-Emery \u2013 their best player to that point \u2013 who would eventually make way for Mbapp\u00e9, rather then the mummified entity still going by the name of Neymar. And from the start PSG just looked utterly flat, a collection of random parts trying in vain to assume the shapes of a team. For a while Bayern dominated, not just taking the ball and keeping it, but looking so much more coherent as an entity. Jo\u00e3o Cancelo fizzed a cross through the six-yard box. Towards half-time Joshua Kimmich had a shot that whipped past the post.  As for Paris, well, they had Messi. And even here when he dropped deep and ran with the ball \u2013 PSG\u2019s only noticeable attacking tactic \u2013 you still felt that thrill of recognition, the energy field of this unmistakable presence, the great mobile brain. Otherwise it was cautious stuff. Bayern tried to create patterns, to press in packs and find overloads out wide. Paris defended in two blocks and waited for their superstar front two to create an illusion of motion. It took Bayern eight minutes of the second half to score the game\u2019s only goal. Alphonso Davies had replaced Cancelo at half-time, and he made it, whistling in a hard, flat, outswinging cross from a strangely untended left touchline, left vacant as Danilo rumbled back on after an injury. Coman finished expertly on the volley, before engaging in a rather faux-humble non-celebration in front of his former supporters. The angle, the first-time finish, the colours brought to mind his winner in the Covid summer Champions League final of 2020.  As did the abrupt appearance of Mbapp\u00e9, who might have won that game, but was here now to save this one \u2013 and was desperately needed given PSG\u2019s entropy to that point. Bayern should have added another. Jamal Musiala began to fizz and twirl in tight spaces. Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting saw a close-range shot well saved by Gianluigi Donnarumma. At the other end Mbapp\u00e9 provided a first glimpse of that thrillingly effortless speed, veering in on goal, feet barely grazing the turf and drawing a fine close-range save from Yann Sommer, the ball bouncing back off his face. PSG were better in those final 20 minutes, given life by some angry driving runs from Mbapp\u00e9. He had the ball in the net but was offside, narrowly. Messi saw a shot deflected just over the bar. At the death Benjamin Pavard was sent off for a second yellow card. But really this was thin gruel for a team of such riches, which just seems to have too many room-temperature parts, too little in the way of internal structure, and a forward plan still based around wheeling its star parts into place and hoping for ignition. Even without the away goals rule Bayern\u2019s 1-0 lead looks formidable. For PSG, halfway out of elite competition for another year, there is a sense of dissonance, of key parts ageing and starting to come undone. A great deal hangs on the second leg in Munich."

Play had been stopped because fans were receiving medical treatment after disturbances in the stands, at which point a Goztepe supporter ran on to the pitch, picked up the corner flag and used it to attack the Altay goalkeeper, Ozan Evrim Ozenc, before being restrained by nearby players and security staff.\n\nGoztepe and Altay are longstanding rivals from the city of Izmir, with the derby a notoriously fiery fixture. The game had already been stopped in the 19th minute after fireworks were thrown at the home fans from the away section.\nElsewhere on Sunday, the Russian Cup tie between Zenit St Petersburg and Spartak Moscow descended into chaos when six red cards were issued after a mass brawl in stoppage time. With the scores goalless and penalties looming, a clash between Quincy Promes and W\u00edlmar Barrios prompted the referee to sprint across and forcibly separate the pair, before players and staff rushed over and a huge fracas broke out with punches and kicks being aimed from both sides.\nThree players from each team were sent off, including two who had already been replaced and and one unused substitute. Zenit went on to win the penalty shootout 4-2."

                    "body": "On 18 October, the BBC marks the 100th birthday of its foundation (one month before it started regular radio broadcasting). It will be hoping the celebrations make the case for its continuation, amid discussions with the government over the broadcaster\u2019s form and funding after the current agreement runs out in 2027. Given political pressure for the BBC to become more commercial, there\u2019s an irony that it was exactly that a century ago. The British Broadcasting Corporation, state-owned under royal charter, has only existed since 1 January 1927. From 18 October 1922 until then, it was the British Broadcasting Company \u2013 a consortium of wireless receiver manufacturers. My selection of shows from each of the BBC\u2019s 100 years aims to recognise the \u201cbest\u201d (subjective as that inevitably is) but sometimes the worst. These are part of the BBC\u2019s history, too \u2013 and sometimes threatened to end it. Some ground rules: I have picked only programmes made by the BBC, which excludes imports (Dallas, Neighbours, Das Boot) no matter how significant. And because, say, Sir David Attenborough could represent at least five years, each creative (unless part of a comedy team) features only once.  Many early BBC records are missing, so some shows have been reconstructed from Radio Times back copies, newspaper listings and reviews, and memoirs or biographies. Another important source is the Official History of Broadcasting in the United Kingdom by Asa Briggs.  1922 \u2013 Preliminary Broadcast  \u201cHello, hello. This is 2LO, the London station of the British Broadcasting Company calling! 2LO calling.\u201d The experimental network 2LO had broadcast one hour a day since 11 May. From 14 November, it was transferred to the British Broadcasting Company. This call-sign formally started BBC broadcasting, and the first voice heard was that of Arthur Burrows. He read a one-minute weather and news bulletin, then repeated it at dictation speed so listeners (estimated at 10,000) could take notes \u2013 education was a key aim of the BBC from the beginning. For this, the first licence fees cost 10 shillings, equivalent to about \u00a319 today. 1923 \u2013 Organ Recital at the Steinway Hall Broadcast at 3pm, this was the first \u201cwireless\u201d programme listed in the launch edition of Radio Times on 30 September. It kicked off five and a half continuous hours of organ music, which likely reflected the kind of material deemed appropriate for a Sunday \u2013 then sacred as the Christian day of rest.  1924 \u2013 Woman\u2019s Corner For most of its 100 years, the BBC has been accused of being too London-centric. But at the start, short and weak radio signals required 20 transmission centres around the UK, all with different schedules. Those in range of Birmingham got Woman\u2019s Corner at 4.45pm. This mother-programme to one of radio\u2019s biggest franchises featured a daily talk: subjects included topical horticultural hints and Shakespeare\u2019s heroines. 1925 \u2013 The Travelling Man Until at least the 1990s, the vast majority of broadcast dramatists were male, but one of the earliest radio playwrights was Lady Gregory, though she was more likely chosen for her aristocratic heritage than proto-feminism. The opening lines of this one-act play \u2013 \u201cWhat is it you are going to make, mother?\u201d / \u201cI am going to make a grand cake with white flour. Seeds I will put in it\u201d \u2013 spookily foresaw the future significance of baking to the BBC. 1926 \u2013 Big Ben, Weather Forecast and General News  A sequence still familiar to listeners \u2013 time signal (the chimes of Big Ben), climate news, headlines \u2013 became part of the rhythm of radio. But a news bulletin on 4 May triggered the first of many times that a government threatened the BBC over its journalism. A miners\u2019 strike led to an industrial walkout. As this included print workers, the government filled the newspaper gap with its own propaganda sheet, the British Gazette, edited by the then chancellor of the exchequer, Winston Churchill. Infuriated that news bulletins early in the dispute neutrally reported the views of government, unions and employers, Churchill sought to use emergency powers to take over the British Broadcasting Company (as it still was) as an official Downing Street mouthpiece. John Reith, the BBC\u2019s general manager, resisted this, but was forced by the government to deny a voice to opposition politicians. This tension \u2013 a broadcaster owned by the state but seeking editorial independence from it \u2013 has continued for 96 years. 1927 \u2013 The FA Cup Final  This was the first ever live commentary for an event that remains in the BBC schedules in 2022. Cardiff beat Arsenal 1-0. Curiously, the commentator, George F Allison, later became the Arsenal manager. A picture of the Wembley pitch, divided into eight squares, was printed in Radio Times; during the transmission, Allison\u2019s assistant, Derek McCullouch, shouted out which quadrant of each half the ball was in. On 1 January, after five years as a private company, the BBC became a state-owned network, its final initial now standing for \u201ccorporation\u201d. Reith became the first director general and received a knighthood. 1928 \u2013 Wish Wynne The first variety (the precursor to light entertainment) slots drew on music hall entertainers, including Wish Wynne, a comedienne \u2013 as listings billed her \u2013 with a speciality of \u201cfairytales in cockney character parts\u201d. Wynne became so devoted to radio that, insisting the show must go on despite frail health, she collapsed at the end of a Sunday broadcast in 1931 and died soon after. 1929 \u2013 The Second News Now broadcasting from 10.30am until midnight, the BBC\u2019s wireless service expanded to two daily news bulletins: the first in the early evening, the second later at night, a pattern that continues to this day. Even big news \u2013 such as the Wall Street crash in November \u2013 would wait until those slots, so scheduled shows such as More Biscuit Recipes and Elementary French could always go out as planned.  1930 \u2013 The Man With the Flower in His Mouth  The first drama broadcast in both picture and sound was an adaptation of this short play by Italian dramatist Luigi Pirandello. Co-produced with TV pioneer John Logie Baird\u2019s own company, the show had few actual viewers (hardly any sets existed) but showcased the BBC\u2019s bi-media future. In another major restructuring, from 9 March, the wireless output was divided into regional and national programming. The Man With the Flower in His Mouth was reserved for regional London audiences. 1931 \u2013 The Mary Celeste: A Mystery of the Sea This was the origin story of one of TV\u2019s superpower genres: the true-crime drama. L Du Garde Peach, a prolific writer of historical sketches for Children\u2019s Hour, recreated the mystery of the American merchant ship found floating in 1872 with its entire crew missing. \u2022 Coming up tomorrow in part two (1931-41): the king falls, peace fails."

                    "body": "  12.38pm    Well, that was intense. Congratulation to Iran, commiserations to Wales \u2013 but it\u2019s still up for grabs in Group B. I\u2019ll leave you with Ben Fisher\u2019s report from the Ahmad bin Ali Stadium, and don\u2019t forget to join Tom Davies for Qatar v Senegal at 1pm. Bye!       12.28pm         12.23pm    And that\u2019s how to lose graciously      12.23pm    \u201cI\u2019m just one simple Iranian-American fan of Team Melli,\u201d says Mehrun Etebari, \u201cbut I think I must speak for many others when I say that Wales remain an inspiration. If Iran can go forward and put together a run even half as compelling as the Welsh run to the semis of Euro 2016 I\u2019ll be ecstatic. Smaller teams live for the hope, and Wales showed that sometimes that hope can be rewarded.\u201d Now that\u2019s how to win graciously.     12.19pm    \u201cWatching the first half I turned to my mate and said \u2018this has Scotland written all over it\u2019,\u201d says Kerr Wells. \u201cHeroic, disappointing, \u2018what might have been\u2019 elimination. Stand by for Wales to beat England to add to the folklore.\u201d With Iran scoring a 104th-minute winner against the US to put Wales out.  Updated at 12.44pm GMT    12.17pm    The BBC are showing a montage of Iran putting it about. There were a few bits of naughtiness \u2013 standing on Kieffer Moore\u2019s toe at a corner, things like that \u2013 and it\u2019s probably fair to assume that a European referee would have given one or two more yellow cards. But it was hardly England 1972 (Berlin branch) or Brazil 1974, and it doesn\u2019t change the essential truth: the best team won.  Updated at 12.46pm GMT    12.16pm    There is a not inconceivable way that Wales can qualify (I think)  England beat the USA The USA draw with Iran Wales beat England B   Updated at 12.47pm GMT    12.14pm    Wayne Hennessey\u2019s red card      12.13pm   The Iran coach Carlos Queiroz speaks   It\u2019s just the beginning, we need to finish the job. It was a wonderful day for us \u2013 we [stuck] to football, and I don\u2019t have words to say thank you to the players. They were brilliant, they deserve all the respect. People will now understand that these boys love to play football. [What\u2019s your message to the Iranian people?] The players, they deserve to be supported. We did it for them, we did it for them. That\u2019s the only reason we\u2019re here, to play for the fans.  I assume he\u2019s referring to the fact that the players chose to sing the national anthem before the game. For any team, never mind one whose country is experiencing civil unrest, they played with phenomenal intensity.   Updated at 12.22pm GMT    12.12pm    \u201cCan\u2019t begrudge them,\u201d says Matt Dony. \u201cThe better team won. There\u2019ll always be a \u2018what if\u2019 around Moore\u2019s volley in the first half, but it wasn\u2019t to be. It\u2019s still Wales at the World Chuffing Cup, which is more than I dreamt of for most of my life.\u201d     12.10pm   Gareth Bale's verdict   It\u2019s gutting [boings his lips]. We\u2019re gutted, there\u2019s no other way to say it. It\u2019s difficult to take but we have to recover and try and go again. It\u2019s gonna be difficult [to qualify] for sure, it depends on the other game. I haven\u2019t seen the red card so I don\u2019t know [if it was a fair decision], but it changes the game completely.   Updated at 12.11pm GMT    12.08pm    What it all means Wales aren\u2019t out, but they need snookers now. Iran will almost certainly go through if they beat the USA and may well do so with a draw, though that depends on what happens between England and the USA tonight.     12.05pm    Let\u2019s be clear: Iran were deserved winners. They were the stronger team even before Wayne Hennessey was sent off, and kept playing with purpose and belief even when it looked like time was up. They scored in the 98th and 101st minutes, shattering the Wales players in the process.      12.03pm   Full time: Wales 0-2 Iran  I don\u2019t know what to say.     12.03pm    Wales threw everyone forward and paid the price. It was a four-on-two break, finished delightfully by the relentless, indefatigable right-back Ramin Rezaeian. Ansarifard put him through with a square pass on the edge of the area; he drew Ward and lifted the ball slowly, teasingly, joyously over him. In the circumstances, that is some finish.  Updated at 12.11pm GMT    12.01pm   GOAL! Wales 0-2 Iran (Rezaeian 90+11)  It\u2019s all over now!   Updated at 12.09pm GMT    12.00pm    Devastation for Wales, and sheer, frenzied joy for Iran. A low cross from the left wasn\u2019t dealt with properly by Joe Allen \u2013 the kind of absent-minded clearance you\u2019d expect from somebody who has been on all game in that heat, but not necessarily from a substitute \u2013 and ran to Cheshmi, 25 yards from goal. He half-controlled it on the stretch, ran after the loose ball and whistled a brilliant curling shot towards goal. It brushed the fingertips of the diving Ward, who saw it late and was at full stretch, and nestled in the bottom-right corner. My word.  Updated at 12.42pm GMT    11.59am   GOAL! Wales 0-1 Iran (Cheshmi 90+8)  What a goal from Rouzbeh Cheshmi!    Updated at 12.05pm GMT    11.58am    90+7 min All the players who started the game look completely spent, physically and emotionally.      11.56am    90+6 min Neco Williams\u2019 mishit shot almost falls for Johnson at one end; then Rezaeian\u2019s shot is blocked by Davies at the other.     11.55am    90+6 min Jahanbakhsh is booked a high challenge on Mepham; it\u2019s his second yellow so he\u2019ll miss the USA game. It also allows Wales to waste another 30 seconds.     11.54am    90+5 min Rezaeian is booked for dissent.     11.54am    90+4 min Now James is fouled just inside the Iran half. These dead seconds are precious for Wales. Davies eventually drives the free-kick into the area and Hosseini \u2013 the replacement goalkeeper who has been terrific \u2013 claims decisively.   Updated at 11.58am GMT    11.53am    90+3 min And if you want to know more about the man Wayne Hennessey inadvertently homaged with that assault on Taremi, Gary Naylor is your friend.      11.52am    90+2 min The resulting free-kick is eventually fed in towards Moore, in a bit of space in the area, but his first touch is a weary one that runs through to Hosseini. There was a sniff of a chance there.     11.51am    90+2 min Moore, who must be utterly shattered, does superbly to hold the ball up, draw a foul and buy Wales a bit of time.     11.51am    90+1 min There will be nine added minutes. Wales are on the ropes, the brink, the edge; the lot.     11.50am    90 min As my colleague Daniel Harris rather brilliantly puts it: Hell, bloody football.     11.49am    89 min: So close from Torabi! This is unreal. Ansarifard has a shot blocked, then Torabi smashes a rising drive from the edge of the area that goes this far wide of the right-hand post.     11.48am    88 min: Wales substitution The sub goalkeeper Danny Ward replaces Aaron Ramsey.     11.47am   HENNESSEY IS SENT OFF!  86 min It looks worse every time you see it. He could have been sent off twice: once for the denial of a clear goalscoring opportunity and once for poleaxing Taremi with what was essentially a knee to the face. He launched into a scissor kick, thinking he was going to get to the bouncing ball a split-second before Taremi. He was wrong. \u201cShades of Schumacher\u201d says the BBC commentator Steve Wilson. Unlike Harald Schumacher in 1982, Hennessey was going for the ball \u2013 but he didn\u2019t get it and he flattened Taremi with a combination of knee, hip and arm. Even Andre the Giant would have gone down from that.    Updated at 12.30pm GMT    11.45am   VAR CHECK  Hennessey will be sent off here.     11.45am    84 min: It\u2019s all kicking off! Taremi just beats Hennessey to a long ball forward, 40 yards from goal, and is totally wiped out. The referee gives a yellow card, which can only be because he thought Neco Williams would have got to the loose ball before Taremi. Personally I think it\u2019s a clear goalscoring opportunity. More importantly so do the entire Iran team, who are raging at the referee.  Updated at 12.29pm GMT    11.44am    83 min: Good save from Hosseini! Williams\u2019 long-range shot is unwittingly blocked by Moore, but he is alert enough to lay the loose ball off to Davies on the edge of the area. He crashes a rising drive that is pushed over by the leaping Hosseini. A good save, though one he\u2019d expect to make.     11.43am    83 min: Iran substitution And now they have none, unless the game goes to extra time: Ezatolahi is replaced by Ali Karimi.     11.42am    82 min Ezatolahi is down with cramp. Iran have one substitution remaining.      11.41am    80 min Gareth Bale has done nothing. Nada. Zilch. The square root of bugger all. If I was an Iran supporter, the \u2018it\u2019s too darned quiet\u2019 principle would be haunting me.  Updated at 11.41am GMT    11.39am    79 min \u201cIt says something about how stressed the Wales fans at the stadium must be,\u201d begins K\u00e1ri Tulinius, \u201cthat they loudly applauded winning a throw-in near the half-way line. Enjoy the last twenty minutes!\u201d     11.38am    78 min: Wales substitition Joe Allen, who has been out since mid-September, comes on for Ethan Ampadu.   Updated at 11.42am GMT    11.38am    78 min: Triple substitution for Iran After a lot of faffing, Ali Jahanbakhsh, Mehdi Torabi and Rouzbeh Cheshmi replace Gholidazeh, Hajisafi and Nourollahi.     11.35am    75 min For most of the game Iran have played on the break, but at the moment they are all over Wales like a cheap cliche. If Gareth Bale is going to write another script, now would be a decent time.     11.34am    74 min \u201cA draw is ok,\u201d pleads Matt Mony. \u201cIf this finishes even, and assuming England beat the USA, then England are guaranteed to go through as group winners. Meaning they could play a weaker team in the last game, with a Gijon-esque lack of intensity. Is it how I dreamed Wales would go through? No. Would I take it? Absolutely!\u201d      11.34am    73 min: Fine save by Hennessey! Wales are right on the edge here. Ezatolahi shifts the ball away from a Wales player in the D and sweeps a low, right-footed drive towards the far corner. Hennessey, who must have seen it late, gets down to his right and fingertips it round the post. That\u2019s an extremely good stop.  Updated at 11.35am GMT    11.32am    72 min Gholizadeh\u2019s cross is shinned behind by Rodon. The corner is taken short and eventually comes to Pouraliganji, whose shot is blocked.     11.32am    71 min Ezatolahi\u2019s angled cross beyond the far post is headed down by Pouraliganji, still up from a corner, and Hennessey is quick off his line to claim. Wales look tired now.     11.31am    70 min Sheesh, this is tense. If it stays like this the winners will be the USA, though it\u2019s pretty complicated. A draw isn\u2019t the end of the world, or the World Cup.   Updated at 11.40am GMT    11.30am    69 min Reorder these letters: SFF.      11.29am    68 min: Iran substitution Karim Ansarifard replaces Sardar Azmoun, who has run himself into the ground.     11.28am    67 min Johnson slows down in the area, then zips past Mohammadi and drives a low cross towards the near post. Bale misses an attempted flick behind his standing leg and Iran clear. That was good from Johnson, exactly the kind of no-nonsense running Wales want from him and James.     11.27am    66 min Iran have been heavy-footed at times in this hame, and Pouraliganji leaves a bit on Moore after a free-kick has been given.     11.26am    65 min The resulting corner hits the unsighted Johnson and runs to safety. Iran appeal unsuccessfully for handball. It did hit his hand, but it was pretty close to his body. VAR isn\u2019t interested.     11.25am    64 min Another very dangerous break from Taremi. He runs 40 yards, with Mepham backpedalling the whole way, then shifts the ball inside for a shot that is crucially blocked by the covering Ampadu.      11.24am    64 min \u201cI\u2019m hoping one or both of them will prove me wrong and score worldies to win the game for Wales,\u201d begins Michael Gibson. \u201cBut on the evidence of this and the match against USA, both Bale and Ramsey look past it. Ramsey in particular is a shadow of the player he once was, I\u2019ve lost count of the number of times he\u2019s given the ball away. Bale saunters around the pitch like he\u2019s on an extended lap of honour. So come on lads, prove me wrong!\u201d     11.23am    63 min Taremi leads another break and slides an angled through pass towards the unmarked Rezaeian on the right side of the area. James stretches to poke the ball behind for a corner, an important bit of defending.   Updated at 11.34am GMT    11.22am    62 min Make sure you click for the full picture.      11.21am    62 min A dangerous cross from Williams evades everyone in the middle.     11.21am    61 min As the old proverb says, it\u2019s better to be lucky than to be 1-0 down in a musn\u2019t-lose World Cup game.      11.20am    61 min Iran have a substitute ready but Azmoun wants to continue. He\u2019s put in a helluva shift today.     11.20am    60 min Azmoun is down again. I think his game might be over.   Updated at 11.33am GMT    11.19am    59 min This is the revised Wales formation, 4-2-3-1. Hennessey; N Williams, Mepham, Rodon, Davies; Ramsey, Ampadu; Johnson, Bale, James; Moore.     11.18am    57 min Mohammadi fouls Wilson, which gives Rob Page the chance to make a double substitution.  Brennan Johnson and Dan James replace Harry Wilson and Connor Roberts, which means a) pace, b) pace and c) a switch to 4-2-3-1.      11.16am    56 min Now Hajisafi has a shot blocked, I think by Mepham. Wales are hanging on.     11.15am    55 min Ramsey is fouled 35 yards from goal, right of centre. Wilson\u2019s free-kick is poor, straight into the arms of Hosseini.     11.13am    53 min At the other end, Moore beats Hosseini to Bale\u2019s cross and heads onto the roof of the net. The referee might have given a foul against Moore, I\u2019 not sure; either way, it was a half chance at best.  Updated at 11.14am GMT    11.13am    51 min: Iran hit the post twice in 10 seconds! Scenes galore! First Azmoun rumbled into the area from Nourollahi\u2019s angled through pass, held off Rodon and slapped a shot against the right-hand post. Gholizadeh kept the ball alive and shaped an extravagant long-range curler that beat the flying Hennessey and thumped off the left-hand post. It rebounded to Azmoun, who was off balance and could only head straight at a very grateful Hennessey.   Updated at 11.17am GMT    11.11am    50 min Plenty of Wales possession at the start of the second half, though it\u2019s largely in front of the Iran defence. Moore does make a run in behind, down the right, but he\u2019s flagged offside.      11.10am    49 min \u201cI\u2019m sat at my desk, with the game on an iPad beneath my work screens, just a few yards from my boss,\u201d writes Matt, erm let\u2019s change his name just in case, Bony. \u201cI would dearly love to be able to say I was on the beers, but I just don\u2019t think I could get away with it. Should have thought of an Irish coffee, though. And some strong chewing gum.\u201d     11.09am    48 min Another dodgy square pass, this time from Ramsey, puts Wales in trouble. It\u2019s stolen and fed towards Azmoun, who is well tackled by Mepham in the area.   Updated at 11.14am GMT    11.08am    47 min \u201cMorning Mr Smyth,\u201d writes Bill Hargreaves. \u201cAfter the eagle-eyed reader spotted that Tite is, in fact, the \u2018Genial\u2019 Harry Grout (Porridge), I was wondering if Rob Page might have a hint of Bernard '\u2018Orrible\u2019 Ives about him? \u201cSouthgate is, need it be said, Barraclough, making the scheming Harry Kane, Fletch; Gareth Bale being his Lenny Godber. While we\u2019re casting, is Didier Deschamps Mr. MacKay? I have John Stones down as Luke Warm. \u201cSincerely, Blanco Webb.\u201d     11.05am    46 min Peep peep! Iran begin the second half, with no changes on either side. Yet.     11.04am    More half-time reading Germany v Spain, Sunday, 8pm GMT      10.56am    Half-time reading      10.56am    \u201cHello from Swansea!\u201d says Rob Morgan. \u201cI can confirm that a number of us are indeed on the beers, a lot of pubs have kindly opened early for the match. \u201cAlso with regards to the playlist, and in honour of my hometown/team, I think we\u2019d need some SWANS on there?\u201d Well, if you insist.      10.53am    The BBC team are all saying this is a must-win game. That\u2019s not quite the case. It\u2019s a bit complicated, but if this is a draw and England beat the USA tonight \u2013 if, if, if \u2013 both Wales and Iran will still have their destiny in their own hands. (Edit: no they won\u2019t, I\u2019m a moron, but Iran would know that a win over the US would put them through unless Wales beat England.)  Updated at 11.15am GMT    10.51am   Half time: Wales 0-0 Iran  \u201cIt\u2019s hot, and Wales have been a little bit bothered by Iran,\u201d says the BBC commentator Steve Wilson. Wales have had most of the ball but Iran have been the more dangerous team on the counter-attack. Ali Gholizadeh and Sardar Azmoun combined for a fantastic goal that was ruled out for offside; at the other end, Kieffer Moore\u2019s flying volley was beaten away by Hossein Hosseini.   Updated at 11.01am GMT    10.50am    45+4 min The resulting free-kick ricochets dangerously around the area before being cleared. Then Nourollahi hits a long-range shot that is well held by Hennessey. It was straight at him but bounced awkwardly just in front.     10.48am    45+3 min Rodon is booked for an absurd sliding foul on Taremi.  Updated at 10.48am GMT    10.48am    45+2 min Iran work the ball patiently on the right, until Ezatolahi suddenly whips a fantastic cross towards the six-yard line. Azmoun and Rodon both lunge for the ball, but it evades them both and bounces to safety. Azmoun was goalside, and for a split-second it looked like he was going to score.     10.45am    45 min There will be four added minutes.   Updated at 10.46am GMT    10.44am    43 min The BBC picture disappears for a few seconds. Happily for them, Bale doesn\u2019t pick that moment to roof one from 40 yards.     10.42am    43 min The corner is claimed with authority by Hossein Hosseini.     10.42am    42 min Good play from Wales. Davies guides a good ball into Moore on the edge of the area, and he touches it off first time (or miscontrols it, I\u2019m not entirely sure) towards the onrushing Wilson. He hits a first-time shot that is blocked by Pouraliganji and spins over the bar for the first corner of the match.  Updated at 10.43am GMT    10.41am    40 min Free-kick to Iran, 40 yards out. Hajisafi overhits it slightly and it goes behind for a goalkick. Both teams look like they are ready for a breather.     10.39am    39 min Bale galumphs down the left and drives a low cross that is kicked away by Majid Hosseini.     10.38am    38 min \u201cI\u2019m an American who lives in Cardiff with my Welsh husband,\u201d writes Gwyneth Galvin. \u201cI\u2019m visiting my Ohioan family for the holidays, but I set my alarm for 5am so I could catch the match. I\u2019m currently under the covers, suffering a food hangover only made worse by the anxiety of this game. Go on Wales!\u201d     10.37am    37 min Wilson finds Williams in space on the left side of the area, but his first touch is heavy and Rezaeian makes a good tackle. That was half a chance for Wales.     10.35am    35 min Rodon is living on the edge against Azmoun. He makes another desperate last-ditch tackle to stop Azmoun running onto a long ball forward. Rodin has been left one v one quite a lot, which is slightly surprising given that Wales have three central defenders and he is theoretically the spare man.   Updated at 10.43am GMT    10.35am    35 min \u201cHi Rob,\u201d says Anshuman Pande. \u201cYou linked an excellent Gorky\u2019s song at the start of the MBM today. Over the years, lots of your Guardian colleagues on MBM duties have also linked some absolute beauts. Might I suggest a yearly playlist of some of the best MBM music? I\u2019m sure it will beat EA\u2019s playlist by miles.\u201d That\u2019s a good idea. When the group stages are over, and assuming I don\u2019t forget, I\u2019ll try to set one up.  Updated at 10.35am GMT    10.34am    34 min A bit of a quiet spell. If they didn\u2019t know before \u2013 and to be fair, I\u2019m sure they did \u2013 Wales realise now that they are well and truly in a game.     10.33am    33 min \u201cHello from the stadium,\u201d says Pierre Martins. \u201cThere is a dude with the world\u2019s most annoying vuvuzela sat next to me. Var ruling the goal offside made him sad.\u201d I wouldn\u2019t like to run into the world\u2019s least annoying vuvuzela, never mind the most annoying.   Updated at 10.35am GMT    10.31am    31 min Here\u2019s more on the slightly unexpected sight of the Iran players singing their national anthem before the game.      10.30am    31 min You could never leave Gareth Bale out \u2013 imagine the state of Twitter \u2013 but part of me wonders whether, particularly in this heat, you might get more bang for your Bale by bringing him on for the last half hour. Anyway, it\u2019s irrelevant.     10.30am    30 min Bale, hitherto anonymous, mishits a long-range volley through to Hosseini.     10.28am    28 min Azmoun is okay to continue, at least for now.     10.27am    27 min This is a concern for Iran: Azmoun is receiving treatment for the calf problem that has kept him out for the last couple of months. He\u2019s been a serious handful for Wales.  Updated at 10.28am GMT    10.27am    26 min Iran break at pace again. Azmoun tries to run the last man Rodon, who times his lunging challenge perfectly. Gholizadeh shoves Williams over, then chooses to berate him for some reason.     10.26am         10.25am    24 min Williams is limping heavily after being wiped out by Rezaeian. It wasn\u2019t a particularly malicious foul, and it was Rezaeian who alerted the referee so that he could stop play.     10.24am    24 min Here\u2019s that early chance for Kieffer Moore. I\u2019ll post the disallowed goal, which really was a gem, as soon as it appears on the BBC Twitter feed. Talking of which, treat yourself to the Joy of Six: Goals That Never Were. Not now.      10.23am    23 min Rezaeian\u2019s free-kick is headed wide by Azmoun, leaping above Rodon at the far post. He couldn\u2019t get over the ball.     10.22am    22 min Ampadu trips the raiding Rezaeian 35 yards from goal. Iran have been terrific so far.     10.21am    20 min \u201cPhew!\u201d says Matt Dony. \u201cI flipping love VAR.\u201d A quick for Wales fans \u2013 are you on the beer? I can still remember folk in suits hurrying through pre-work pints at 7am on a Friday, as if it was their national duty, when England played Brazil in the 2002 quarter-final.   Updated at 10.23am GMT    10.20am    20 min Another very dangerous Iran break ends when Nourollahi\u2019s shot is blocked by Rodon. Iran are the better team at the moment, no question about that.     10.18am    18 min Bale goes down holding his face after wearing a straight arm from Mohammadi. It was a foul but no more.  Updated at 10.18am GMT    10.17am   NO GOAL! Wales 0-0 Iran  As disallowed goals go, it was a beauty. Roberts\u2019 dodgy square pass was nicked by Gholizadeh, who played a dizzying, progressively orgiastic exchange of first-time passes with Azmoun \u2013 one, two, three, four \u2013 before walking the ball into the net. But when the last pass was played, Gholizadeth was slightly \u2013 and needlessly \u2013 offside. Azmoun could have taken the shot himself as well.   Updated at 11.03am GMT    10.16am    This will be ruled out for offside     10.15am   GOAL! Wales 0-1 Iran (Gholizadeh 16)  VAR permitting, this is a wonderful goal from Iran!   Updated at 10.19am GMT    10.13am    13 min Moore stays down for a bit, but after receiving treatment he is back on his feet.     10.13am    12 min: Good save by Hosseini! Davies sprays a crossfield pass out to Roberts, who pulls it down and shapes a lovely cross towards the near post. Moore stretches to stab an instinctive volley from six yards that is parried away by Hossein Hosseini. Had Moore\u2019s volley gone either side of the keeper he would probably have scored. To exacerbate his pain, Majid Hosseini accidentally kicks him in the face in his follow through.   Updated at 10.17am GMT    10.09am    9 min Iran\u2019s front two, Taremi and Azmoun, are looking really dangerous. An attempted give-and-go is thwarted by a sliding Wales defender on the edge of the area.     10.08am    8 min \u201cChecking in from a wonderful but grey damp Copenhagen where I shall be sporting my Welsh bucket hat in the Danish Design Museum while checking in to MBM,\u201d says Kim Thonger. \u201cMay fortune favour the Bale.\u201d If that\u2019s not an excuse to post a video of Preben Elkjaer, then I don\u2019t know what it is.      10.07am    7 min Azmoun drags a daisy-cutter through to Hennessey from about 20 yards. Iran look bright in attack.     10.06am    6 min A wicked cross from the right-back Rezaeian is headed away desperately by the backpedalling Rodon. That was very good defending.   Updated at 10.12am GMT    10.05am    5 min A long ball towards Azmoun is well defended by Mephan, who stoops to head back to Hennessey.     10.04am         10.03am    3 min Wilson plays a simple ball back to Neco Williams, who cuts inside and whistles a decent long-range shot over the bar. Hosseini wasn\u2019t troubled but it\u2019s a positive start for Wales.   Updated at 10.10am GMT    10.01am         10.00am    1 min Peep peep! Wales kick off from left to right as we watch. They are in red; Iran are wearing white.     10.00am    It\u2019s time for the football. A draw isn\u2019t the end of the World Cup for either team, but both really need a win.     9.57am   Iran players sing national anthem  Both teams line up for the anthems. For once \u2013 and this really doesn\u2019t happen very often - Hen Wlad Fy Nhadau is overshadowed by the Iran anthem. Most of the Iran players choose to sing this time, having remained silent before the England game. I think one or two players were silent this time, too, though I couldn\u2019t be sure. (In fact I suspect I\u2019ve got that wrong \u2013 I\u2019d imagine their approach was unanimous. Maybe a couple were mumbling.) There were certainly whistles, boos and tears in the crowd.   Updated at 10.04am GMT    9.54am    Here come the players. It looks ferociously hot out there.     9.53am    A reminder of the teams Wales (possible 5-3-1-1) Hennessey; Roberts, Mepham, Rodon, Davies, N Williams; Ramsey, Ampadu, Wilson; Bale; Moore.Substitutes: Ward, Davies, Gunter, Allen, Johnson, Morrell, Lockyer, J Williams, Harris, James, Thomas, Levitt, Cabango, Colwill, Smith. Iran (possible 4-4-2) H Hosseini; Rezaeian, Pouraliganji, M Hosseini, Mohammadi; Gholizadeh, Ezatolahi, Nourollahi, Hajisafi; Azmoun, Taremi.Substitutes: Niazmand, Abedzadeh, Moharrami, Khalilzadeh, Kanaanizadegan, Cheshmi, Jalali, Amiri, Ghoddos, Torabi, Karimi, Ansarifard, Jahanbakhsh. Referee Mario Alberto Escobar Toca (Guatemala)     9.53am    It\u2019s another big day for Gareth Bale. Assuming he isn\u2019t sent off before the game for wearing a OneLove onesie, he\u2019ll win his 110th cap \u2013 a record for the Welsh men\u2019s team.     9.50am     The best bit is the way Bale drawls the \u2018effing\u2019, as if he\u2019s trying to sneak it in before the watershed without anyone noticing. (NB: the below clip contains the old C-word.)      9.47am    \u201cThe Guardian fixtures page,\u201d begins Alec Gregory, \u201cshows just what Scotland thinks of this \u2018World\u2019 Cup.\u201d      9.45am    Mood music      9.44am    \u2018If we\u2019re handing out insults for being fat, let\u2019s have a go at him. Look at him!\u2019      9.44am    \u201cI am still absorbing the news that Wales beat Hungary in 1958!\u201d says Ian Copestake. \u201cI mean, it was that Hungary! From 1958!\u201d It wasn\u2019t quite That Hungary: Puskas and Kocsis were among those who did one after the Hungarian Revolution of 1956, although Hidegkuti was still playing.      9.40am    The Iran anthem will be watched almost as keenly as the football. It\u2019s a complex, evolving situation, with a lot to take in, but these two pieces are a good place to start.       9.29am    A bit more pre-match reading      9.24am    It\u2019s a sweltering afternoon in Al-Rayyan. As Gabby Logan has just said on the BBC coverage, bucket hats will come in very handy.      9.22am    \u201cMae gen i barch enfawr at Iran, a\u2019u safiad gyda\u2019r anthem,\u201d says Matt Dony. \u201cOnd, dewch ymlaen, Gymru! Joe Allen is so important to Wales. He might not have the star quality of Ramsey or Bale, but he does things that no one else in the squad can do. If he gets a good run out today, and can maybe start against England, then that\u2019s as positive as I could hope to be.  \u201cI really like Dan James, but Kieffer Moore changed the game when he came on against the USA. He\u2019s a decent striker, who seems to have an uncanny ability to raise his game when he plays internationally. Definitely the right call to start him today. Am I rambling? Who knows anymore. I feel sick. I\u2019m staring at spreadsheets, and 10:00 feels like a long way away. It\u2019s Wales, at the World Chuffing Cup!\u201d     9.20am    In other news, Rob Page and Carlos Queiroz have swapped jobs for the day     9.10am    Essential pre-match reading      9.04am   The teams in full  Wales (possible 5-3-1-1) Hennessey; Roberts, Mepham, Rodon, Davies, N Williams; Ramsey, Ampadu, Wilson; Bale; Moore.Substitutes: Ward, Davies, Gunter, Allen, Johnson, Morrell, Lockyer, J Williams, Harris, James, Thomas, Levitt, Cabango, Colwill, Smith. Iran (possible 4-4-2) H Hosseini; Rezaeian, Pouraliganji, M Hosseini, Mohammadi; Gholizadeh, Ezatolahi, Nourollahi, Hajisafi; Azmoun, Taremi.Substitutes: Niazmand, Abedzadeh, Moharrami, Khalilzadeh, Kanaanizadegan, Cheshmi, Jalali, Amiri, Ghoddos, Torabi, Karimi, Ansarifard, Jahanbakhsh. Referee Mario Alberto Escobar Toca (Guatemala)  Updated at 9.06am GMT    8.58am   Iran team news: Azmoun returns  Carlos Queiroz has changed five of the team that lost 6-2 to England on Monday. The goalkeeper Alireza Beiranvand, who suffered concussion in that match and was briefly allowed to carry on despite not knowing his name, date of birth, nationality or even the last three digits on the back of the card, is replaced in goal by Hossein Hosseini. The other changes? Ramin Rezaeian, Ali Gholizadeh, Saeid Ezatolahi and Sardar Azmoun replace Alireza Jahanbakhsh, Ali Karimi, Roozbeh Cheshmi and Milad Moharrami. That should mean a change of system, from 5-4-1 to what the traditionalists call a four-man back four. Azmoun, who has 41 goals in 66 games for his country, joins Mehdi Taremi (32 in 62) in attack. Iran (possible 4-4-2) H Hosseini; Rezaeian, Pouraliganji, M Hosseini, Mohammadi; Gholizadeh, Ezatolahi, Nourollahi, Hajisafi; Azmoun, Taremi.  Updated at 9.11am GMT    8.46am   Wales team news: Moore starts, Allen on the bench  Rob Page makes one very obvious change from the side that started against the USA on Monday: Kieffer Moore replaces Dan James up front.  Joe Allen, who hasn\u2019t played since mid-September because of a hamstring injury, is on the bench.      8.13am         8.00am   Preamble  Who fancies another ride of the emotional rollercoaster? I\u2019m afraid, if you\u2019re Welsh or Iranian, you don\u2019t have much choice. For different reasons, and in different ways, both countries ran the gamut on Monday. It\u2019ll be no different today. Let\u2019s start with the football. Iran realistically need at least a draw to have any chance of reaching the last 16; Wales could theoretically lose today and still go through. But even in the unpredictable game of snakes and ladders that is the World Cup group stage, that\u2019s not to be encouraged. Their target is simple \u2013 a first World Cup win since Terry Medwin\u2019s goal beat Hungary in a playoff on 17 June 1958, ideally with yet another who-writes-Gareth-Bale\u2019s-scripts moment. Qualification may come down to goal difference, but it would be hubristic to think of that at this stage. Iran are a better side than their 6-2 defeat to England suggested. But they also have other things on their mind. Even in this most political of World Cups, Iran\u2019s situation stands out. I won\u2019t editorialise here, and not only because I\u2019m subconsciously terrified of inadvertently saying the wrong thing and being cancelled before a ball has been kicked. It\u2019s a nuanced situation that is difficult to fully understand if you haven\u2019t been following it intently from the start. The players chose not to sing the national anthem before the England game on Monday, their latest gesture in support of those protesting against the shocking death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini in police custody in September. There are fears of reprisals when the tournament is over, but also some confusion as to whether the local celebrations of that defeat on Monday were directed against the state, the team (for \u2018insulting\u2019 the anthem) or both.  We\u2019ll come back to all that when the players line up for the anthems. I have to dash off and write some failed zingers for our rebranded daily football email, Football Daily \u2013 please su\u2019scribe! \u2013 but I\u2019ll be back with team news around an hour before kick off.  Kick off 10am GMT, 1pm at the Ahmad bin Ali Stadium.  "

She had finally got a green light to bring an initial 200 Noble Cups into the country, only to have them confiscated by the Ethiopian Revenue and Customs Authority (Erca) \u2013 over apparent paperwork issues. But Eklund was not deterred. \u201cI thought: go big or go home.\u201d So she went for 5,000 in her second shipment.  There was a new hitch. Erca categorised the product as a luxury item, and imposed a 69% tax. \u201cIt was madness,\u201d says Eklund. \u201cThe system is made to infuriate and frustrate.\u201d With some determination from Eklund, Noble Cup is now on sale in more than 30 shops across the capital, Addis Ababa, with plans to expand. At 230 birr (\u00a33.50), the cups are prohibitively expensive for most women and girls in Ethiopia, where only 28% of women report having \u201ceverything they need\u201d to manage their periods, and 25% do not use any form of sanitary product, relying instead on whatever they can find: rags, newspaper, even cloths filled with ash. Eklund hopes that promoting the product will help encourage a more open discussion, and reduce the stigma and shame around menstrual health. \u201cThis is something every single woman goes through every month,\u201d she says. But shame is deeply embedded, says Mekdim Hailu, campaigner at WaterAid Ethiopia. \u201cPharmacists still hand sanitary pads to customers in newspaper and a plastic bag. Even as young women in an urban area, my friends and I still use code words for periods.\u201d  Hailu welcomes cups as an eco-friendly alternative but says even those who could afford to buy them \u2013 and have access to clean water \u2013 may avoid them for cultural reasons. \u201cWe want girls and women to have many choices, but it\u2019s a foreign concept to put an external product inside your vagina \u2013 even tampons are not used here \u2013 so there is a lot to be done in terms of awareness of this [product].\u201d Born in Virginia to an Ethiopian mother and American father, Eklund went to high school in Ethiopia but returned to the US for college. She was inspired to start her business after her own discovery of menstrual cups, a \u201ceureka moment\u201d in her freshman year. She considered launching a charity to provide cups for free, but her mother, a businesswoman, knocked that idea down. \u201cShe told me, \u2018If it\u2019s going to be anything, it has to be a business \u2013 this concept that Africans just need free stuff is wrong.\u2019\u201d  \u201cShe was right,\u201d says Eklund. \u201cI don\u2019t think donating the cups would have had the same power. When women choose to buy a product, they are more invested in it. They will share stories about it. That\u2019s when behavioural change comes.\u201d Eklund\u2019s team runs basic biology workshops in schools, introducing children to period products. They are also active on social media. \u201cIt\u2019s no coincidence that the rise of the menstrual movement has coincided with the growth of social media,\u201d says Eklund. She cites a woman from Hawassa who contacted the team after watching a TikTok video. \u201cWe sent her some, and she\u2019s become a sort of unofficial ambassador for us,\u201d says Eklund.

Thanks for reading everyone.\nThere\u2019s only one man who could play us out\u2026\n\n\n\n\n 5.24pm  \n\nSo, West Ham boss David Moyes *thrusts mic in face*\u2026 would YOU like to have done a Chelsea and spent \u00a3320m on eight new transfers in the transfer window, ballooning your squad to 33 players?\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure I would. I think sometimes you want to build a team and take it forward. It\u2019s not an easy job. The hardest part as a manager is who to leave out,\u201d said Moyes ahead of West Ham\u2019s London derby clash with Chelsea at the London Stadium this weekend.\n\u201cIt can take time, I can tell you that with us bringing new players in. I think when you spend \u00a3600million, it should give you half a chance. But money isn\u2019t the only thing to do with football, you\u2019ve got to get the team right, you\u2019ve got to get other parts of it going well.\n\u201cHopefully we can give Chelsea a good game, obviously they are a really good team, they\u2019ve got some really talented players they\u2019ve bought in, but they will need time to gel just like the ones we brought in in the summer have taken a bit of time to gel as well.\u201d\nWest Ham are only a point above the drop zone after a difficult campaign but Moyes is looking up not down.\n\u201cI believe we can have a good season. We have still got a lot to play for. I think we\u2019re showing a little bit better signs in some areas but we\u2019re going to be challenged by good teams like Chelsea, we\u2019re going to be challenged in the European competition, which we\u2019re going into again in March, and we\u2019re in the next round of the FA Cup.\n\u201cWe want to try and keep ourselves involved in as many tournaments as we can. But our focus is solely on the Chelsea game and trying to do the best we can against Chelsea.\u201d\n\n\n\n 5.10pm  \n\nAnd here\u2019s Louise Taylor on Leeds United\u2019s hunt to replace Jesse Marsch.\n\nYou\u2019ve seen these no doubt but it seems the right time to crowbar them in.\n\n\n\n\n\n 5.01pm  \n\nHere\u2019s Jamie Jackson\u2019s piece from the Pep press conference.\n\n\n\n\n 4.56pm  \n\nRead all about it. Read all about it\u2026 the Football Daily is out. \n\u201cGuardiola swung haymakers in all directions; he presented one of the world\u2019s richest clubs as a noble, put-upon underdog; and he established a siege mentality with such coruscating precision that Football Daily instantly bet the farm on City winning the Premier League this season. It\u2019s a risky tactic, because he\u2019ll be eating mea culpas for the rest of his natural-born days if City are found guilty, but in the short-term it felt like a cynically brilliant response to unprecedented adversity.\u201d\n\nAnd, looking through the e-mails, \u2018Peter Oh\u2019s Pun Corner\u2019 brings us this: \u201cCity missed a huge PR opportunity by not signing B. Innocent from French Ligue 1 club Lorient during the transfer window.\u201d\n\n\n\n 4.46pm  \n\nBrighton boss Roberto De Zerbi is relishing his first crack at the A23 derby. The Seagulls take on Crystal Palace at Selhurst Park in one of five Saturday 3pm kick-offs in the Premier League.\nDe Zerbi said: \u201cI live for this game. It\u2019s an honour to play this game. We must play a bold game, aggressive game, but I don\u2019t want to lose our quality, our style of play. The first part of the season has been fantastic in terms of results, in terms of quality of play, and we have to continue in this way. But tomorrow is a different game.\n\u201cThe emotions are the most important part of football and we have to feel the emotion in the football. But we have to be clear to the other things, to be focused on the game, on our quality, on our style of play, but we have to feel it\u2019s a different game. We want to beat them for sure. We want to make our fans happy. It will be a very important game for us. I love this kind of game, we are ready to play.\u201d\nWorld Cup winner Alexis Mac Allister is back for Brighton following the Argentina midfielder\u2019s one-match ban for picking up five yellow cards. \u201cIt will be great to have Alexis back, he will play tomorrow,\u201d said De Zerbi. \u201cHe\u2019s a very important player for us, it\u2019s excellent to have him available.\u201d\n\n\n\n 4.36pm  \n\nFulham scored three times in six crazy second-half minutes to win 3-2 at Nottingham Forest earlier in the season. That result left Fulham sixth and Forest languishing in 19th with four points from seven games.\nFast forward to this weekend and while Fulham have continued to flourish (they\u2019re eighth), Forest have climbed to 13th, six points clear of the drop zone.\nHere\u2019s Fulham boss Marco Silva. \u201cIt will be a another tough one. They are different than when we played against them at Forest. I can say completely different, even if most of the players who started that game are going to start again.\n\u201cBut there is a slight difference in some players, they again signed good players in January. We are talking about a club that signed around 25 or 26 players this season. Of course they need time to gel, to put everything in the right direction. They are in good momentum and they want to keep the momentum for sure, but they know as well that it will be tough for them.\n\u201cEveryone that comes to play at the Cottage, normally it is tough for them to play, with the environment that we play, we like to play on the front foot every time. The players feel really well and comfortable with our style, with the way we approach the game.\u201d\nFun fact: Fulham could complete the Premier League double over an opponent for the first time since 2013/14, when they did so against both Aston Villa and Norwich City.\n\n\n\n 4.26pm  \n\nFancy a Friday quiz? It\u2019s a general sports one but has four football questions, including a beaut about Bayern Munich defender Dayot Upamecano.\n\n\n\n\n 4.20pm  \n\nBrentford start the weekend in seventh place. Perhaps even more impressive is that they\u2019ve lost just four of their 21 Premier League games this season. Only Newcastle and Arsenal have suffered fewer. \nBrentford have already won away at Manchester City this term and they\u2019ll hope to cause a similar upset at leaders Arsenal on Saturday.\nHere\u2019s boss Thomas Frank on the task in hand. \u201cI always believe that we can win, but \u2013 and it is a big but \u2013 we are facing Arsenal who are top of the league. They have been going from strength to strength and they are in a fantastic position.\n\u201c[Mikel] Arteta has done a top job in building a culture over three years, making difficult decisions and sharpening a style of play. Arsenal can smell that they have a chance to win the league. It is well deserved that they are top. They look in sync and they have all their key players fit and available. At home they play with an unbelievable intensity.\n\u201cYou can see that they are running harder and in the duels they are giving everything. They are so eager to win and that makes it even more difficult to beat them. To get anything out of this game, we need to top perform. We will probably need the best performance we have ever put out in a Premier League game.\u201d\nBut Frank knows the worth of his own side. \u201cI hope teams respect us for what we are capable of. In this group of players there are a lot of strong characters. They have been growing as individuals. It is a good feeling going into a game knowing that if we top perform then we can do something.\n\u201cWe have always been quite strong defensively, with a good structure, mentality and principles, but now we are in a spell where everything is melted together and it is just working.\u201d \n\n\n\n 4.09pm  \n\nSome more Graham Potter lines from Chelsea\u2019s press conference.\nOn the future of striker Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, who has been excluded from Chelsea\u2019s Champions League squad alongside Benoit Badiashile: \u201cNothing to report. He\u2019s been training with us this week, training really well. Conducting himself well, really good professional, supporting his team-mates. Whilst he\u2019s here he\u2019s doing exactly what I expect him to do, which is to train well and to act well.\u201d\nOn feeling the pressure : \u201cThere\u2019ll be lots of talk around pressure and time. If I\u2019d had a month of time for every time I\u2019ve been asked the question, I\u2019d be here for about 10 years. That\u2019s just the nature of it.\n\u201cI\u2019m not stupid. If the results aren\u2019t what this club should get, and I\u2019m the reason for it, then that\u2019s the job. In the meantime, I go through the process of working with the players, helping them improve, helping them come together.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a complicated situation at the moment. But I\u2019m really excited for it, looking forward to it, really looking forward to the challenge that awaits us. I don\u2019t worry too much about the absolute time scale of it all.\u201d\n\n\n\n 3.59pm  \n\nErling Haaland didn\u2019t have a single touch in the Spurs box in Manchester City\u2019s 1-0 defeat last weekend. But he\u2019s second in this list. Are we slightly surprised by the high placings of Arsenal\u2019s Gabriels given Jesus\u2019s injury absence and Martinelli\u2019s starting position on the left? Maybe Martinelli takes lots of dinky touches in there, like Salah.\n\n\n\n\n 3.52pm  \n\nIf you want to study Pep\u2019s body language \u2013 and choice of cardigan \u2013 this is the video for you.\n\n\n\n\n 3.47pm  \n\nHistory says Aston Villa boss Unai Emery is even more up against it than we think when his team travel to Manchester City on Sunday. From Opta:\n\nManchester City have won their last 12 Premier League home games against Aston Villa, coming from 2-0 down to win 3-2 and secure the Premier League title on the final day of the season.\nAston Villa manager Unai Emery has never beaten Man City\u2019s Pep Guardiola in 12 previous meetings in all competitions, drawing four and losing eight.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve played against Manchester City here and in the Champions League, it\u2019s a very difficult match. Maybe it\u2019s going to be more difficult now with the issues they are having,\u201d said Emery, using his words carefully.\n\u201cI think they\u2019re going to be together and they are going to try and respond on the pitch against us. It\u2019s a very difficult match. Manchester City are building a team to win the Champions League and they are getting close to doing it. In the Premier League they have had amazing results over the last few years. Each year it\u2019s Manchester United, Liverpool, Chelsea, Tottenham, and this year it\u2019s Arsenal, to be close to them. \n\u201cI want to play the same matches in the same competitive way at home and away. We are going to focus on this Sunday\u2019s match, trying to get the same performance away as we did before.\u201d\n\n\n\n 3.36pm  \n\nLeeds interim boss Michael Skubala secured a 2-2 draw at Old Trafford in midweek and he\u2019ll hope to go one better when he locks horns with Manchester United and Erik ten Hag again on Sunday. Skubala will remain in charge while Leeds hunt for a permanent new manager following the departure of Jesse Marsch.\nTalking of which, the PA understands they are still working on a four-man shortlist despite being turned down by Feyenoord boss Arne Slot. That doesn\u2019t seem to have registered with the bookies who still have Slot as favourite. The next four in the betting are Rayo Vallecano coach Andoni Iraola, former Wolves and Spurs manager Nuno Espirito Santo, Marcello Gallardo and Skubala himself. For the record, local news reports in Leeds say former River Plate boss Gallardo has turned down an offer. All a bit vague, isn\u2019t it.\nAnyway, Skubala said: \u201cI\u2019ve been having clear communication every day with [director of football] Victor [Orta]. I expect to be in charge on Sunday. Back-to-back games are unusual, there may be one or two tweaks to the side, but there\u2019s nothing we can change majorly. We can get work done tomorrow and a bit of shape.\n\u201cWe did really well (on Wednesday) but it\u2019s still one point. The book\u2019s closed and Sunday\u2019s a chance for three points.\u201d\nTeam news-wise, skipper Liam Cooper and Marc Roca missed out in midweek due to respective muscle strains and will be assessed. Skubala is hoping Luis Sinisterra can recover from a strain sustained at Old Trafford. Pascal Struijk will miss out under the concussion protocol. He was withdrawn on Wednesday after blocking a shot from Marcus Rashford with his head.\n\n\n\n 3.23pm  \n\nAnd now for Chelsea boss Graham Potter. Can the club\u2019s spending spree trigger a charge up the table? Or will Potter continue to carry the bafflement of a child brought up playing contentedly with wooden toys who has had a pile of shiny new PlayStations thrust upon him.\nThe good news. Joao Felix returns after serving a three-match ban for his red card at Fulham. \u201cIt\u2019s great to have him back. I think we all saw the impact that he had in his 60 minutes before the red card. You could see his quality, I see it every day.\n\u201cHe\u2019s a player that I think can make a difference for us but at the same time it\u2019s about helping him get into the team, get integrated into the team and to the team-mates around him and for him to understand what we\u2019re trying to do, but the signs are really positive.\u201d\nThe bad news. Raheem Sterling has picked up a fresh injury. \u201cWe had a little set-back with Raheem, he had a kick in training so we\u2019re assessing him. I think he\u2019s probably doubtful for tomorrow I\u2019d say. It\u2019s a new injury, he just got a kick in training on the side of his knee.\u201d\n\u2018No one else is back but they\u2019re all getting closer and closer. Wesley has been training with the team, Denis has been training with the team.\nFinally, some news on Wesley Fofana, Denis Zakaria and Mateo Kovacic. \u201cNo one else is back but they\u2019re all getting closer and closer. Wesley has been training with the team, Denis has been training with the team. Mateo\u2019s training with the team, but it will be too soon for him. So there\u2019s good news, we\u2019ve got some options.\u201d\n\nUpdated at 4.01pm GMT\n\n\n 3.08pm  \n\nEverton striker Dominic Calvert-Lewin is a major doubt for Monday\u2019s Merseyside derby at Anfield. The England international played just over an hour of last weekend\u2019s win over Arsenal but afterwards manager Sean Dyche admitted it had been a risk as the player was struggling with a hamstring problem. That has prevented him from training this week and puts his participation at Anfield in doubt.\n\u201cWe\u2019re still monitoring him. It will be touch and go, at best, I would think,\u201d said Dyche. \u201cWe\u2019re hoping it settles down as quickly as possible. He put a real shift in, his stats were very good in the last game and unfortunately he\u2019s got a niggly hamstring and we\u2019ve got to get on top of it as quick as we can.\u201d\nLosing Calvert-Lewin would be a significant blow as Dyche\u2019s only other options are Neal Maupay, who is a long way from being a target man, and 22-year-old Ellis Simms, recently recalled from a loan spell at Sunderland and with just three first-team Everton appearances to his name. But Dyche is keen to maintain the positivity and suggested it was an opportunity for someone to stake their claim.\n\u201cWe adapt to the players that we work with. The obvious two are Simmsy and Neal,\u201d he added on the effect Calvert-Lewin\u2019s absence would have. \u201cThere are different ways the team can operate. I don\u2019t look at one player to try to win games, it has to be a team collective. It is a great opportunity whoever plays next. What a game to be stepping into if he is not right. Get ready to take it on.\u201d (PA Media)\n\n\n\n 3.06pm  \n\nThanks Will. Let\u2019s open with Dyche...\n\n\n\n 3.04pm  \n\nRight, it\u2019s time for me to hand over to Dave Tindall. He\u2019ll bring you the latest from Potter and Dyche. Have a good weekend all.\n\n\n\n 3.03pm  \nArteta says Jesus 'doing really well'\n\nAsked about the timeline for Gabriel Jesus\u2019s return, with the forward sidelined since injuring his knee with Brazil at the World Cup, Arteta sounds cautiously optimistic but declines to give an exact date. \u201cHe\u2019s doing really well, he keeps pushing everyone every single day, but we need to respect some timelines. It\u2019s too far [to set a date]. You have to see now when you start to put some load through that knee, and start to get some movement and some action, how that knee reacts and whether he is comfortable to go to the next stage.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n 2.58pm  \n\nMikel Arteta, Graham Potter and Sean Dyche have taken their places in front of the assorted microphones, dictaphones and plain old phones, with all due credit to the voice memos app. Let\u2019s start with Arteta, who has to find a way past Brentford at the Emirates this weekend. Asked about last Saturday\u2019s defeat to Everton, he says: \u201cIt\u2019s not about being in a comfort zone. We are going to lose matches. Each defeat brings an opportunity to look at other things and see a reaction from the team. Tomorrow we are going to try to put in a great performance in front of our fans and try to win the game.\u201d\n\n\nUpdated at 2.59pm GMT\n\n\n 2.43pm  \n\n\u2026 and here\u2019s Jamie Jackson with more from Ten Hag, who is also delighted with Marcus Rashford\u2019s electric form.\n\n\n\n\n 2.42pm  \n\nHere\u2019s Suzanne Wrack with some analysis of the Women\u2019s Champions League draw. Chelsea have what looks like the toughest quarter-final tie on paper, having been paired with Lyon.\n\n\n\n\n 2.37pm  \n\nErik ten Hag, meanwhile, has also been speaking to the media. He has some qualified praise for Alejandro Garnacho, the teenage winger enjoying a breakout season at Old Trafford. \u201cI think he is doing well, he has an impact on our game, I think he is a threat. [In our 2-2 draw at home to Leeds] he had good actions, he was lively, created chances, but had to score. And, finally, it\u2019s about that, that you have an effect. \n\u201cAs a striker, you have to at least be on the scoring list, the assist list or key action list to have the right impact. As a Man United player, we expect you to have an impact: to influence the score, to influence the result, to positively influence the game by scoring goals and having an assist.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n 2.21pm  \n\nThere will no doubt be plenty of analysis of Guardiola\u2019s comments to come, but, for the moment, let\u2019s leave it there. Elsewhere, as reported by Voetbal International in the Netherlands, Arne Slot, the Feyenoord manager, has no intention of leaving midway through the season to succeed Jesse Marsch at Leeds.\n\n\nUpdated at 2.26pm GMT\n\n\n 2.17pm  \n\nIt should be noted that, as opposed to being found \u201cinnocent\u201d when their Champions League ban was overturned, City were still fined \u20ac10m for failing to cooperate with the investigation, while other aspects of Uefa\u2019s case were found to be time-barred.\n\n\n\n\n\n 2.08pm  \nGuardiola says 'there are no enemies or friends, just interests'\n\nGuardiola pointedly lists the nine teams that wrote to Cas in support of City\u2019s Champions League ban. \u201cIn this world there are not enemies or friends, there are just interests,\u201d he says, which seems like a vaguely terrifying sentiment. He jokes that, if City are relegated to League Two, they will call up Paul Dickov and Mike Summerbee, get the band back together and bounce back to the Premier League. \u201cBut we should wait, because at the end, OK, the Premier League are going to decide and, OK, we are going to defend ourselves like what happened with the Uefa situation.\u201d\n\n\nUpdated at 2.39pm GMT\n\n\n 2.04pm  \n\n\u201cI would love to wait and see,\u201d adds Guardiola. \u201cTime will see, or time will dictate, what\u2019s going to happen. Just in case we are not innocent, we will accept what the judge, the Premier League, decides. But what happens if, in the same situation as with Uefa happened, we are innocent? What happens to restore or pay back our damage?\u201d\n\n\n\n 2.01pm  \n\nThere\u2019s more where that came from. \u201cAnother side I would say is that we are lucky we live in a marvellous country and society where everyone is innocent until proven guilty. We didn\u2019t have this opportunity, we are already sentenced, and \u2018tough\u2019. What happened, I don\u2019t know. On the other side, personally, I am happy that we are here, like Uefa happened. OK, we have a chance to defend [ourselves] \u2026 I think we have good lawyers, Uefa had good lawyers, and the Premier League \u2013 with 19 teams \u2013 are going to take up good lawyers too to defend their position, like we are going to defend our position.\u201d\n\n\n\n 1.57pm  \n\nGuardiola launches into a fierce defence of the club, referencing City\u2019s Champions League ban being overturned in 2020 and the nine clubs that wrote to the court of arbitration for sport calling for the ban to be upheld. \u201cYou have to understand that 19 teams of the Premier League are accusing us without the opportunity to defend [ourselves]. The word of my club, my owner, my chairman, my CEO, my people, who have explained everything over these three or four years\u2026 you know exactly on what side I am.\u201d\n\n\n\n 1.47pm  \nGuardiola's press conference gets under way\n\nRight, here he is. Straight to the point, he\u2019s asked whether, having pledged to leave City if the hierarchy lied to him, he still has confidence in the club. He starts by conveying his and the club\u2019s sympathies to the victims of the earthquakes which have hit Turkey and Syria. \u201cMy first thought is that we have already been condemned,\u201d he says, in reference to the Premier League charges. \u201cWhat\u2019s happening right now, what happened on Monday is the same as what happened with Uefa \u2026 we\u2019ve had already accusations and now we have just \u2018charged\u2019.\u201d\n\n\nUpdated at 1.47pm GMT\n\n\n 1.27pm  \n\nBefore anyone sends me an email containing the words \u201cbias\u201d or \u201cagenda\u201d, it\u2019s best to just repost Max Rushden\u2019s take on the subject. It feels like this piece would dovetail nicely with the \u201cdon\u2019t make me tap the sign\u201d meme.\n\n\n\n\n 1.17pm  \n\nJamie Jackson, our very own Manchester football correspondent, is in situ. Popcorn just out of shot.\n\n\n\n\n 1.12pm  \n\nNot been keeping up with the latest City furore? Here\u2019s some light reading to get you up to speed.\n\n\n\n\nUpdated at 1.13pm GMT\n\n\n 1.08pm  \n\nHello all. Me again, just in time for the day\u2019s big press conference at Manchester City. Here\u2019s a reminder of why it\u2019s so hotly anticipated. Namely, the Premier League charging the club with allegedly breaching its rules on more than 100 occasions.\n\n\n\n\n 1.02pm  \n\nI\u2019m going to tag in Will Magee, as I need to scrutinise Pep\u2019s body language for the purposes of our Football Daily email. Thanks for your company, ta-ra. \n\n\n\n 12.58pm  \n\nWatch Cristiano Ronaldo score his 500th league goal (and nos 501-503)\nI have no idea what to make of this. Historic? Endearing? Odd? Tragicomic? Pathetic? Poignant?\n\n\n\n\n 12.55pm  \n\nA question that has the square root of bugger all to do with football, but to which an answer would be nonetheless appreciated.\nDoes anyone know how I can watch Poker Face in the UK? Legally, ideally, but I\u2019ll try anything once.\n\n\n\n 12.53pm  \n\nOne of the items on Sky Sports\u2019 breaking news ticker is\u2026 Patrick Vieira press conference coming up. I can\u2019t lie to you: I\u2019m not entirely sure this is the future that Walter Cronkite envisaged when he interrupted As The World Turns on 22 November 1963.\n\n\n\n\n 12.48pm  \n\nLook, it\u2019s not us, it\u2019s you\nThis piece from Max is spot on. To suggest an organised conspiracy gives far too much credit to an essentially shambolic industry. In 23 years of this nonsense, I\u2019ve never come across a deliberate or conscious agenda.Except against me, obviously, which is why I\u2019m being paid six figures to write one nerdy yet inexplicably compelling longread a month.\n\n\nUpdated at 12.50pm GMT\n\n\n 12.42pm  \n\nNever mind the WCL, there\u2019s a huge game in the WSL tomorrow: Manchester City v Arsenal. \nThere\u2019s a serious chance that one of these teams will finish outside the top three for the first time since 2014. That would mean missing out of the Champions League. \nIn that sense, it\u2019s a mustn\u2019t lose game. But if they want to maintain their title challenge, it\u2019s probably a must-win game.\n\n\n\n\n 12.30pm  \n\nOn this day in 1996\u2026 Tino Asprilla\u2019s memorable debut takes Newcastle closer to the Premier League title. Or so we thought.\n\n\n\n\n 12.30pm  \n\nPep Guardiola\u2019s press conference is at 1.30pm. I don\u2019t know about you, but I usually despair when people preview press conferences, even more so when they then call them \u201cpressers\u201d. But given the week Manchester City have had, this should be worth following.\nI can see Pep\u2019s weary face now as he\u2019s asked for the 48th time about the minutiae of his employment contract, when all he really wants to talk about is overloads in wide areas. \n\n\n\n 12.25pm  \n\nOn this day in 2002\u2026 Sylvain Wiltord\u2019s freak goal kickstarts the greatest winning run in Arsenal\u2019s history.\n\n\n\n\n 12.23pm  \n\nSo, the dream domestic final is still on. But enough about PSG v Lyon, because Arsenal and Chelsea could also meet in Eindhoven on 3 June. Ho ho ho however it plays out, there are going to be some cracking games over the next few months.\n\nUpdated at 12.24pm GMT\n\n\n 12.21pm  \nThe WCL semi-final draw\n\n\nParis Saint-Germain/Wolfsburg v Bayern Munich/Arsenal\nLyon/Chelsea v Roma/Barcelona\n\n\n\n\n 12.16pm  \nThe full WCL quarter-final draw\n\n\nBayern Munich v Arsenal\nLyon v Chelsea\nRoma v Barcelona\nParis Saint-Germain v Wolfsburg\n\n\n\n\n 12.15pm  \n\nParis Saint-Germain v Wolfsburg\n\n\n\n 12.15pm  \n\nRoma v Barcelona\n\n\n\n 12.14pm  \n\nLyon v Chelsea\nHello!\n\n\n\n 12.13pm  \n\nBayern Munich v Arsenal\n\n\n\n 12.13pm  \n\nHere comes the WCL quarter-final draw\u2026\n\n\n\n 12.12pm  \n\nOn this day in 1991\u2026 Sampdoria continue their glorious march towards the club\u2019s only league title, with the great man getting the second goal in their 3-0 win at Bologna.\n\n\n\n\n 12.12pm  \n\nWomen\u2019s Champions League draw\nAny minute now. They\u2019re going through the usual preamble.\n\nUpdated at 12.12pm GMT\n\n\n 12.06pm  \n\nA reminder of last season\u2019s WCL final, when Ada Hegerberg inspired Lyon to a famous win over the holders Barcelona.\n\n\n\n\n 12.03pm  \n\nWomen\u2019s Champions League draw\nIt\u2019s coming up any minute now.

I say heavy lifting, it\u2019s only a few keystrokers really.\n\n\n\n\n 11.57am  \n\nOn this day 50 years ago\u2026 John Radford scored one of the great forgotten goals.\n\nIf you want a bit of context, you can read more on my Substack.\n\n\n\n 11.39am  \n\nFrom the archive (II)\n\nFor some reason the original matador-and-bull dance never became part of the canon, despite the Match of the Day cameras having also witnessed Manchester United\u2019s impotent shame. The most underrated passage of play in the history of English football? Yes\n\n\n\n\n\n 11.39am  \n\n\u201cGood to see the league table, thanks, and remind myself that it\u2019s not all doom and gloom,\u201d writes Matt Dony. \u201cIf Liverpool win their game(s) in hand, they\u2019ll be up to 8th, and only just behind Brentford and Brighton! Dizzy heights! I mean, the word \u2018If\u2019 is doing a lot of work there, but still. Something to hang on to\u2026\u201d\nDelusio- sorry, hope springs eternal. I think they\u2019ll finish the season really strongly, like they did after another winter breakdown in 2020-21, but they\u2019ve probably left it too late to finish in the top four.\n\nUpdated at 11.53am GMT\n\n\n 11.36am  \n\nWomen\u2019s Champions League draw\nThe draw for the quarter-finals (and the semis) will take place around midday UK time. As you\u2019d expect, it\u2019s a cracking line-up.\nGroup winners Chelsea, Wolfsburg, Arsenal, Barcelona\nGroup runners-up Paris Saint-Germain, Roma, Lyon, Bayern Munich\nChelsea can\u2019t draw PSG, who they met in the group stage; ditto Arsenal and Lyon. \n\n\n\n 11.22am  \n\nOn this day 30 years ago\u2026 emergency forward Paul Warhurst continues a remarkable run of form as Sheffield Wednesday win 4-2 at Blackburn in the first leg of their Coca-Cola Cup semi-final.\n\nThirty years though.\n\nUpdated at 11.23am GMT\n\n\n 11.16am  \n\nFrom the archive\n\nIn a magnificent maelstrom of a match that featured 12 yellow cards, one red and a clatter of controversial penalty calls, Gerrard may well have got himself hurt or sent off: certainly he wouldn\u2019t have conjured the magic that McAllister mustered in the last minute.\n\n\n\n\n\n 11.15am  \n\nA reminder of the Premier League table ahead of the weekend fun and games.\n\n\nUpdated at 11.24am GMT\n\n\n 11.08am  \n\nOn this day in 1990\u2026 Spurs won a league game at Stamford Bridge for the only time between 1986 and 2018. And yes, that is the people\u2019s commentator, Richard Keys, providing the soundtrack.\n\n\n\n\n 11.08am  \n\nLiverpool v Everton\nAnd here\u2019s more on Jurgen Klopp\u2019s press conference this morning, including his decision to give the players two days off after their grisly defeat at Molineux last weekend.\n\n\n\n\n 11.06am  \n\nBournemouth v Newcastle\nHere\u2019s Eddie Howe on the prospect of returning to the club where he has spent most of his adult life.\n\n\n\n\n 11.00am  \n\nOn this day in 1988\u2026 Ted McMinn scores a belter, and Gordon Strachan invites Peter Shilton to have a little sit-down (14m56s if it doesn\u2019t start in the right place).\n\n\n\n\n\n 10.52am  \n\nCrystal Palace v Brighton (Saturday, 3pm)\nHere\u2019s Ed Aarons\u2019 preview of the big game at Selhurst Park. Palace, who haven\u2019t won at home since October, are in danger of being dragged into a relegation struggle. They are 12th, which looks very snug, but they are only six points clear of Everton in 18th.\n\n\n\n\n 10.49am  \n\nQatar x Man Utd \n\nThe redevelopment of Old Trafford is long overdue, but anybody who visited the grotesque and soulless domes of Qatar\u2019s World Cup will testify that money can buy you a lot of things, but it doesn\u2019t buy you taste.\n\n\n\nUpdated at 10.53am GMT\n\n\n 10.48am  \n\nContinental Cup\nChelsea will play Arsenal in the final on 5 March after marmalising West Ham in last night\u2019s semi-final. In a surprising development, Sam Kerr scored four of their seven goals.\n\n\n\n\n 10.42am  \n\nLiverpool v Everton (&amp; other stories)\n\nLiverpool are in a truly horrible slump, however, having scored twice in their past five games in all competitions \u2013 both goals coming from Harvey Elliott \u2013 and conceded eight, leaving J\u00fcrgen Klopp to cut an increasingly resentful figure. The odds still favour the hosts on Monday, but good luck to all those in the post-match press conference if Klopp\u2019s side, like Arsenal last weekend, succumb to the grinding might of Dycheismo.\n\n\n\n\n\n 10.39am  \n\nCrystal Palace v Brighton (Saturday, 3pm)\nIf you want to know how Crystal Palace v Brighton became such a combustible fixture, this old piece from Simon Burnton is well worth a read.\n\n\n\n\n 10.36am  \n\nLincoln play Bristol Rovers at home tomorrow. This, one must confess, would not ordinarily merit inclusion in the Friday football blog \u2013 but have you seen their home record in League Two?\nP13 W2 D11 L0 F13 A10 P17\nDespite, or perhaps because of, that record, Lincoln could be relegated this season. This led to a cracking question in this week\u2019s Knowledge, which I had the abundant pleasure of researching.\nI promise, if you\u2019re a league-table nerd, this isn\u2019t clickbait; it\u2019s clickbloodyoxygen.\n\n\n\n\n 10.16am  \n\nFulham v Nottm Forest (Saturday, 3pm)\nAlthough they have not won a league match in nearly a month, there is no doubting Fulham\u2019s gathering sense of purpose this season. Narrow league defeats by Newcastle and Tottenham were followed by a goalless draw against Chelsea before this week\u2019s FA Cup fourth-round replay win at Sunderland (despite nine changes) that set up a fifth-round tie against Leeds.\nThe manager, Marco Silva, will be back in the dugout for the visit of Nottingham Forest, another side finding their feet in the top division, having served a one-match touchline ban. \u201cOf course I want to be with my players \u2026 to feel the emotions of the game in a different way,\u201d Silva told the BBC on Wednesday after paying his dues. \u201cThe view is much, much better \u2026 you can see everything in a different way,\u201d Silva said of his evening in the Stadium of Light stands.\nHe might be saying the same of Fulham\u2019s lofty league position if they can successfully unlock Steve Cooper\u2019s miserly defence: victory could potentially lift them up to sixth place. Forest were arguably fortunate to keep Leeds at bay in their 1-0 win last Sunday, and there will be plenty more defending to do in south-west London. Based on their own confidence-boosting Premier League run, Cooper\u2019s side will approach the match without fear. Luke McLaughlin\n\nUpdated at 10.18am GMT\n\n\n 10.15am  \n\nEddie Howe on Christian Atsu, who is still missing after the earthquakes in Turkey and Syria\n\nIt\u2019s hugely worrying. Really, really enjoyed working with Christian [when he was on loan at Bournemouth] \u2013 great lad, great player. Thoughts are with him and his family. We hope there\u2019s some good news. We hope he\u2019s okay. But we\u2019re really concerned for him and his welfare. It\u2019s been difficult because they have been conflicting stories about his whereabouts\u2026 I can\u2019t imagine how his family are feeling. From the bottom of our hearts we wish him well and hope there\u2019s a positive ending.\n\nThen, after a slightly awkward segue, Howe confirmed that Alexander Isak has passed concussion protocols and will be in the squad for Newcastle\u2019s trip to Bournemouth.\n\nUpdated at 11.05am GMT\n\n\n 10.06am  \n\nLiverpool\u2019s Jota may return against Everton\nJurgen Klopp is getting his press conference out the way so he can enjoy his Friday, like Alvy Singer and Annie Hall having their first kiss before the meal so that they can digest their food better.\nHe seems amiable enough, if a little coiled, and says that the intensity of Liverpool\u2019s training has been extremely good this week. Diogo Jota was among those training with the requisite intensity, and Klopp says he could be involved against Everton on Monday night. Roberto Firmino may also be in the squad, but it\u2019s too early for Virgil van Dijk. Thiago Alcantara is also doubtful because of a hip problem.\nOh, and Klopp had absolutely nothing (say it again) to say about Manchester City.\n\n\nUpdated at 10.21am GMT\n\n\n 10.01am  \nPreamble\n\nRight, who\u2019s got that Friday feeling? I\u2019ll tell you who hasn\u2019t: Pep Guardiola. For a start he\u2019s working the weekend, again, and before that, at around 1.30pm, he has to endure a press conference in which the first 474 questions will all be about Manchester City\u2019s alleged financial tomfoolery.\nAt the best of times Pep fulfils his media commitments with all the loquaciousness and joie de vivre of an introvert on a stag do. These, emphatically, are not the best of times.\nAs well as a forensic study of Pep\u2019s face as he processes yet another passive-aggressive reminder of his pledge to quit City if they ever lied to him, we\u2019ll have the usual hype and bullishness ahead of an important weekend in the Premier League. It\u2019s a pretty good set of fixtures, including some of English football\u2019s bigger rivalries.\nSaturday (3pm unless stated)\n\nWest Ham v Chelsea (12.30pm)\nArsenal v Brentford\nCrystal Palace v Brighton\nFulham v Nottingham Forest\nLeicester v Tottenham\nSouthampton v Wolves\nBournemouth v Newcastle (5.30pm)\n\nSunday\n\nLeeds v Man Utd (2pm)\nMan City v Aston Villa (4.30pm)\n\nMonday\n\nLiverpool v Everton (8pm)\n\n\nUpdated at 1.18pm GMT\n"

                    "body": "Round about a year and a half ago, Mois\u00e9s Caicedo was playing for Independiente del Valle in his native Ecuador, making a name for himself as a skilful and physical all-round midfielder. As such, he was offered to Manchester United, who\u2019ve been in desperate need of that since God was a lad, and Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r was keen, only for those above him to deem the deal too complicated, demanding, as it did, the payment of money. So Caicedo went to Brighton, whose negotiators somehow navigated the torturous path of handing over the asking price, and has been excellent ever since. He stood out in his new side\u2019s 4-0 thrashing of United last season and also in their opening-day win over them, such that United now want to sign him in what would be yet another triumph for football\u2019s most-fabled recruitment department. However, Arsenal, West Ham, Juventus, Atl\u00e9tico Madrid and Bayer Leverkusen are also monitoring the situation. Nor is he United\u2019s only target \u2013 they are also feigning interest in Espanyol\u2019s Ra\u00fal de Tom\u00e1s. Expect them to be enthusiastic right until they discover the price is determined, not by the buyer but by the seller. Meanwhile, the astute decision to first buy Cristiano Ronaldo, then retain him against his will, continues to bear fruit. Ronaldo, it is said, is knocking about Carrington with all his usual grace and humility, so United have offered him to both Milan clubs. Amazingly, neither are keen to disturb their playing system or dressing-room equilibrium for a past-it prima donna, so he remains at Old Trafford \u2013 at least until his contract is cancelled, at which point the number of clubs keen on him, currently zero, is expected to increase. But all the discussion of United\u2019s behaviour should not distract us from that of Barcelona. They\u2019d like to rid themselves of Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang \u2013 some might say they have no choice but to, given their general indebtedness and the wages they owe Frenkie de Jong \u2013 but have rejected a \u00a312m bid from Chelsea. In the meantime, Xavi is acting with all the sensible frugality of a man who spent six years playing and managing in Qatar, mithering Joan Laporta to resign \u2013 sorry, to re-sign\u00ad \u2013 Lionel Messi from Paris Saint-Germain.  But all the discussion of Barcelona\u2019s behaviour should not distract us from that of Chelsea, blazing money despite exchanging an owner who is one of the richest men in the world for an owner wanting to cosplay director of football. As well as offering for Aubameyang, Todd Boehly is also interested in signing Anthony Gordon from Everton, while Everton would like to relieve Chelsea of Armando Broja \u2013 who they are reluctant to lose. All in a day\u2019s work for an expert of Todd\u2019s standing. But all the discussion of Barcelona and Chelsea\u2019s behaviour should not distract us from that of Nottingham Forest, who are busy swapping the squad that got them promoted for a squad of expensive randoms \u2013 such activity having such a strong history of success. The latest player on whom they\u2019re keen is Houssem Aouar of Lyon, who it appears, actually exists \u2013 like Leandro Dami\u00e3o and Nico Gait\u00e1n before him, there were strong rumours that he was a figment of the now-sentient transfer window\u2019s imagination \u2013 but it now looks that, at long tedious last, he is heading for Premier League."

                    "body": "An overambitious schedule, a heavy cold and mental fatigue finally caught up with Magnus Carlsen at the Oslo Esports Cup this week. The world champion had won the previous two legs of the online Meltwater Champions Tour and was expected to make it three in his home city, but it was Poland\u2019s Jan-Krzysztof Duda who edged ahead in Thursday\u2019s final round. Leading scores were Duda (Poland) 14/21, Le Quang Liem (Vietnam) 13, Carlsen (Norway) and Rameshbabu Praggnanandhaa (India) 12, Shak Mamedyarov (Azerbaijan) 11.  A novel format was that the eight grandmasters were all present in the same studio and sat at the table as in an over-the board tournament; but instead of a chessboard between them there were computer screens. Coincidentally or not, the incidence of unintended mouse slips and clicks seems to have been higher than normal. Carlsen has rarely performed at his best in Oslo, which was the scene of one of his most devastating defeats when he lost 2.5-13.5 to Wesley So of the US in the 2019 Random Chess final. This time he was still in contention on Thursday despite two previous mini-match losses but played limply against Mamedyarov and the world No 7 won 2.5-0.5. Afterwards Carlsen apologised for his performance: \u201cIt\u2019s not nearly good enough \u2026 I have no energy in my body whatsoever.\u201d The No 1\u2019s setbacks began early on and reflected his busy schedule. In the afternoon before his round two match he led the Norway team in a solidarity match against Ukraine where viewers could donate to war relief. Carlsen beat his old rival Vasyl Ivanchuk but lost to Yuriy Kozubov and Kirill Shevchenko as Ukraine won 11-5. He then arrived, late and with a heavy cold, for his Esports Cup match and lost 1.5-2.5 to Le Quang Liem. Carlsen recovered and trounced Praggnanandhaa, who had beaten him earlier this year, by 3-0. The 31-year-old then looked set for a comfortable tournament victory until disaster struck against Jorden van Foreest, the winner of Wijk 2021 and a member of Carlsen\u2019s world championship backroom team.   The position at move 20 is complex, but Carlsen had a winning tactic available in 20 Bxa6! Bxa1 21 Nxb7!. Instead he chose 20 Ra2??, only to be shocked by the simple capture 20\u2026Bxa2. This is an example of how long-distance diagonal queen and bishop moves are among the hardest to visualise, which applies even more if a backward capture is involved. Van Foreest drew their other three games to win the mini-match 2.5-1.5, but Carlsen caught up next day with an easy win against the Canadian streamer Eric Hansen. Their third game began with a Grunfeld (1 d4 Nf6 2 c4 g6 3 Nc3 d5) where Carlsen\u2019s 7 Qa4+ is rare. The queen later went to c2 and f2 to join an attack on the king which became decisive when Black missed the defence 25...exf4 26 Bxf4 f5! The drawing of lots to decide the pairings for the Fide Candidates, to be played in Madrid in June, was made in Abu Dhabi on Thursday. Starting numbers are: 1 Duda, 2 TBC, 3 Fabiano Caruana (US), 4 Teimour Radjabov (Azerbaijan), 5 Alireza Firouzja (France), 6 Hikaru Nakamura (US), 7 Ian Nepomniachtchi (Fide/Russia), 8 Richard Rapport (Hungary). Place two remains subject to Sergey Karjakin\u2019s appeal against suspension. If that appeal fails, the place will go to Ding Liren (China). One pairing already stands out \u2013 Caruana and Firouzja, the two pre-tournament favourites, will meet in the 14th and final round. The American Cup, a knockout event between eight top US players, ended on Thursday night at St Louis with victory for the world No 4 and 2018 title challenger, Caruana, who successively defeated Jeffery Xiong, Samuel Sevian, Leinier Dom\u00ednguez and Levon Aronian to take the $50,000 first prize. Several of Caruana\u2019s games lasted more than 50 moves as the 29-year-old took the opportunity to hone his play before the Candidates. The American Cup for Women, with a $25,000 first prize, included a contestant with a potentially significant future. Alice Lee, who lost to the US No 1 woman, Irina Krush, in Thursday\u2019s final, is only 12 years old and has made a rapid advance in the past year, gaining over 300 rating points and qualifying for the WIM and FM tites.  Lee has won four gold medals in world youth championships, has a Fide rating of 2348 which ranks her as No 1 under-16 girl in the world, and scored her first international master norm at open level in February at Fort Worth, Texas. This last result, achieved at 12 years four months, may be the second youngest IM norm ever by a female, behind only the legendary Judit Polgar, who did it at 11. The Beth Harmon of the 2020s? Time will tell. England\u2019s Zoe Veselow (girls under nine), Kushal Jakhria (under seven) and Bodhana Sivanandan (girls under seven) all won gold medals at the European Schools Championships, which finished in Rhodes on Friday. The trio will now compete this weekend in the World Cadets Rapid (Saturday-Sunday) and Blitz (Monday-Tuesday) Championships. Games can be followed live at chess24.com. 3813: 1 Rd6! and if Qxf7 2 Rxh6 mate, or Rxe5 2 Qxc4 wins."

                    "body": "We will probably have to wait until he has left the job to hear exactly what Eddie Jones thinks about how club and country co-exist in England but he gave a clue shortly before he was appointed. \u201cHow can you manage your players when they are controlled by other organisations?\u201d the Australian asked in late 2015. \u201cIn my opinion, that\u2019s the single greatest task ahead of whoever is going to be appointed as the next England coach.\u201d It is a task Jones initially met with belligerence \u2013 as demonstrated with his \u201cDonald Trump of rugby\u201d jibe at the Bath owner Bruce Craig \u2013 but one that he has learned to grin and bear, and while the Rugby Football Union rarely behaves like Jones is kept on any sort of leash, it seems obvious he is now under strict instruction when it comes to criticising that particular arrangement. It is up for renewal soon enough, after all.  Having said that, the subtext this week of Jones declaring Ireland, where the union enjoys far more autonomy over its players, the most cohesive side in the world was clear. But perhaps his comment that the playing field is levelled at the World Cup is more instructive. Because, at times, Jones gives the impression of someone impatiently counting the days until early next summer and the first day of the 2023 World Cup campaign. There was a telling line, buried deep within an RFU announcement last year that the Premiership would be allowed to halt relegation, which said that, in return, the union would have more preparation time in the build-up to the World Cup. Indeed, it is understood the RFU has discussed urging the Premiership to host its 2022-23 final as early as mid-May, and if Jones was not leading those negotiations then rest assured he will have approved. The rub, however, is that Jones has already proven to his employers what he is capable of when allowed to spend time knocking his players into shape. Yes, the 2019 World Cup budget was overspent by nearly \u00a31m, and in the current climate you cannot see that happening again, but he has a body of evidence to demonstrate he can achieve the cohesion he so covets next summer, and for that reason it is hard to see him being sacked even if England lose on Saturday and in Paris next Saturday. You sense Jones knows it, too. The mind goes back to the bowels of Twickenham after one of England\u2019s 2019 warm-up fixtures in which Jones waxed lyrical over the physique of Billy Vunipola, conducting a TV interview on the other side of the room. Go back over the highlights reel of England\u2019s quarter-final win over Australia and Jonny May \u2013 who scored two tries that day \u2013 looks more like a turbo-charged flanker such is the bulk he had put on. Above all else, with uninterrupted access to his players, Jones was able to get Manu Tuilagi in peak shape for the rigours of an arduous campaign. If conditioning was key for Jones, off the field he achieved cohesion too. Jones discusses the booze-fuelled flare-up between Mike Brown and Ben Te\u2019o at a camp in Treviso in his book and pointedly says that was far from the only conflict within the squad. It is believed there was one particular incident when a player\u2019s comedy routine went down so badly he and a teammate had to be pulled apart, and it has been suggested that at one point the rifts were so deep they seemed irreparable. By the latter stages of the tournament, however, players were lining up to explain how it was the most harmonious environment they had been involved in. At first it came across as empty rhetoric but increasingly it seemed genuine.  All of which brings us to Twickenham on Saturday, when the majority of the 82,000 supporters in attendance could not care less about England\u2019s pre-World Cup camps next year. They do not want to hear that the current side is a work in progress, that they are on a journey towards France 2023 and that they are heading in the right direction. They do not want to hear that their side are not favourites or that progress is not always linear, and they cannot countenance England being out of the Six Nations title race before the final weekend again. Rather, they simply want to see England perform as the richest union in the world should and to hell with tomorrow. Twickenham is, after all, expensive \u2013 it is understood that next season more than two-thirds of tickets are set to cost more than \u00a3100 \u2013 so supporters expect value for money. But it was telling this week to hear Jones say the difference for England is that they are not immune from criticism even when they win; you almost wonder if that has encouraged his World Cup preoccupation. That is, of course, not to say that Jones is unmoved about Saturday\u2019s outcome and obviously a resounding victory, founded on power and poise, will boost England\u2019s chances both in this Six Nations and at the World Cup. Jones always publicly insists that he is only bothered about the next game \u2013 to the extent that the phrase has lost all meaning \u2013 and though he will relish adding the final touches next summer, the cohesion he strives for on the field needs to develop over the next 12 months. The average paying punter, though, cares little beyond the next 80 minutes.  It should be acknowledged that the groans that greeted performances in late 2020 and early 2021 have largely dissipated. Granted, England have come from a low base \u2013 when the ball was described by George Ford as a \u201cticking timebomb\u201d \u2013 but there was a swagger, as well as a good slice of fortune, to last autumn\u2019s win over South Africa and there are some encouraging signs around this team, even if there is a fogginess to it all as well. Jones has complete conviction it will clear by next year and though he has lost two finals, his World Cup record stands scrutiny with the best. Defeat on Saturday, however, and the clouds above Twickenham will darken. Jones, just as 12 months ago, will have another storm to ride."

                    "body": "Flightline delivered the performance that fans on both sides of the Atlantic were hoping to see in the Breeders\u2019 Cup Classic at Keeneland on Saturday, powering eight-and-a-quarter lengths clear of his field in the home stretch after cruising through the first mile behind a white-hot pace. We will never know for sure if Flightline is as good as Secretariat, the legendary Triple Crown winner in 1973, but the four-year-old now has a very strong claim to be the best American racehorse since.\nLife Is Good, who took the Dirt Mile at last year\u2019s Breeders\u2019 Cup, scorched through the opening half-mile in 45 seconds in an attempt to burn off Flightline, who had won his five starts before Saturday\u2019s race by an average margin of 12\u00bd lengths.\n\nIt was a futile exercise, and Life Is Good paid the price late on as he faded into fifth place in the stretch while Flavien Prat and Flightline streaked clear. Prat barely moved in Flightline\u2019s saddle as he extended his margin to a record for the Classic, confirming John Sadler\u2019s four-year-old, already the top-rated dirt horse of the last 20 years, as an all-time great.\n\u201cHe\u2019s been brilliant,\u201d Sadler said, \u201cbrilliant is his normal. He didn\u2019t disappoint. He never has.\n\u201cThis is a rare horse, it happens every 20 or 30 years. One of the best American racehorses we\u2019ve seen in a long, long time, and I\u2019m talking back to Secretariat, Seattle Slew. You go through the list.\n\u201cI\u2019ve tried to be a good steward with him, be fair with him. And if you\u2019re good with your horses, they\u2019re good with you.\u201d\nAn injury shortly after Flightline arrived at Sadler\u2019s yard delayed his racecourse debut until April 2021 and cost him the chance of testing himself against the best of his generation in America\u2019s Triple Crown races. But he has scaled the heights in just six races since, and the question now is whether he will continue his brief career into a third season on the track.\n\nFlightline\u2019s brilliance was the abiding memory of the 39th Breeders\u2019 Cup, but it was also an outstanding meeting for runners trained in Europe, as the visitors took six of the seven races on turf.\nThere were three more victories on Saturday\u2019s card after a hat-trick on Future Champions Friday, as Rebel\u2019s Romance and Modern Games completed a double for Charlie Appleby in the Turf and Mile respectively and Tuesday, the Oaks winner at Epsom in June, stormed down the home straight to win the Filly &amp; Mare Turf for Aidan O\u2019Brien.\nAppleby and O\u2019Brien finished the weekend with three winners apiece, and Appleby\u2019s success with Rebel\u2019s Romance \u2013 a first winner at the Breeders\u2019 Cup for James Doyle \u2013 means that he has now won six of the last eight races at the meeting in which he has saddled a runner. O\u2019Brien, meanwhile, left Keeneland with three winners at a single Breeders\u2019 Cup for the first time, and Ryan Moore, his No 1 rider, won the Bill Shoemaker Award for the top jockey at the meeting.\nMoore delivered Tuesday with an irresistible charge down the home straight, beating the front-running In Italian by a length.\n\u201cShe had a beautiful trip,\u201d Moore said. \u201cThe pace was strong and I was in a good spot. I was able to go where I needed to go.\n\n\u201cShe won the Oaks and I thought she would win Group One\u2019s all year, and for whatever reason, things worked against her. She was beaten by [subsequent Arc winner] Alpinista, which was a huge run in hindsight. But today she showed up and put in a really good and professional performance.\u201d\nWilliam Buick also left his challenge until the closing stages on Modern Games, running down Shirl\u2019s Speight well inside the final furlong as Kinross and Frankie Dettori also finished strongly into third from a difficult draw in stall 13.\n\nIt was a second win at the meeting for Appleby\u2019s colt, following his success in the Juvenile Turf at Del Mar 12 months ago.\n\u201cHe\u2019s the ultimate professional, he does what it says on the tin, basically,\u201d Appleby said. \u201cHe\u2019s a typical [son of] Dubawi, he won\u2019t lie down. He\u2019s not the biggest but he seems to grow an extra inch when he\u2019s over here.\u201d"

                    "body": "The end of Formiga\u2019s career is in sight but her battle will not be over then. The 43-year-old is the only player (male or female) to have played in seven World Cups and seven Olympics and while she is still playing club football for S\u00e3o Paulo she is also aware that there is a job to be done once she stops playing. Formiga is known as the indefatigable player of Brazilian women\u2019s football. She has always talked about her commitment to the sport and how she has taken care of herself to enjoy such longevity on the pitch. Now, though, her voice is starting to become as prominent as her game.  \u201cI was always really reserved,\u201d she tells the Guardian before revealing that for every year that passed she became more and more aware of the importance of what she represented as a black, lesbian footballer. \u201cWe now have the freedom and respect of people who admire our work \u2013 and that gives me the confidence to speak up.\u201d Formiga has suffered prejudice throughout her career and that has made her wary of public attention. But with growing support towards women\u2019s football, she feels that the world is now a safer space to share pictures and videos of herself and her wife, Erica, and to talk about her race and sexuality to the media. By doing so, she hopes to inspire others. \u201cI believe there are girls that may still be afraid to come out,\u201d she says. \u201cWhen we show our lives to people, we can also inspire a family member to think differently, and that they can accept their children the way they are. What we really hope and wish for is to have 100% respect. That we can go anywhere without prejudice, to restaurants and cinemas, that we can be seen with good eyes, because like it or not, we\u2019re doing good for each other.\u201d For most of her life Miraildes Maciel Mota had to deal with many challenges, not only related to the attitudes towards her being an athlete but also because of her sexuality. There has been a rise in awareness towards the LGBTQ+ population in Brazil and their rights but there is still a lot of violence. \u201cI\u2019m not saying that this prejudice is over. But there\u2019s no way for us to hide any more,\u201d she says. \u201cWe live in a different era.  \u201cWhen I started playing football we didn\u2019t have the protection we have today. Back then people\u2019s minds were really bad. Now we live in a different era, in a new world. So I think we need to show ourselves and earn the respect that didn\u2019t exist before.\u201d Even though Formiga has seen a lot of changes in Brazil, she wants more to be done. It is not only female footballers who are abused. Recently the Flamengo forward Gabriel Barbosa was the subject of racist abuse from Fluminense supporters. \u201cIt is extremely unfortunate that we still see these racist issues,\u201d Formiga says. \u201cIt should have been eradicated from society by now, not only in Brazil but in the rest of the world too. I think there needs to be stricter punishments for these attitudes so that it becomes a deterrent for people, a lesson that this can\u2019t happen any more. \u201cPeople need to respect other human beings, respect people who are doing some good things. It doesn\u2019t matter if some fans don\u2019t want to accept that another team is better but they need to see that they are human beings, that we are all the same, and we need to respect that. The law needs to improve, it needs to be stricter.\u201d  Formiga says she has felt the need to join fellow players in their battle to end discrimination in football. She believes the Brazilian FA (CBF) can do more and become a role model for other areas of the world. \u201cWe can become an inspiration for other countries, a reference,\u201d she says. \u201cThe football associations need to campaign [against the prejudices] all the time, as do players, not only from football but from all sports. There needs to be a joint effort to make sure that our law changes as quickly as possible so that we can deal with this. \u201cPeople need to be educated. Sometimes they don\u2019t see what their actions are doing to another person. So we can start something, together with the government and the justice system, to have more severe punishments to fight racism once and for all.\u201d When Formiga was born, in 1978, women\u2019s football was still banned by law in Brazil. That changed a year later and, four decades on, she knows her personal story is connected to the history of the women\u2019s game. She also feels she is worthy of people\u2019s respect because of her achievements.  The midfielder, who played an incredible 234 times for her country, was part of the most successful generation of Brazilian female players, winning two Olympic silver medals. She has played for years alongside legends such as Marta and Cristiane but for a long time it was not easy to know the real Formiga. She avoided the spotlight and only used the attention to ask for better support for her fellow players. Having played in Brazil, Sweden, the United States and France, she is now using her experience to advise younger players how to navigate their careers. \u201cI tell them to never stay in the comfort zone,\u201d she says. \u201cNothing is going to happen if they don\u2019t put the effort in or if they\u2019re not committed. I always wanted to encourage the girls I had the opportunity to play with so that they can believe in their potential and appreciate our sport at all times, because it is a constant struggle. We hold hands and keep fighting to improve the women\u2019s game worldwide. That way we can fight for equality, for our rights and to be more recognised every day.\u201d Formiga is content at the moment. She is happy to focus on her club and happy to consider everything that she has done. \u201cI feel fulfilled knowing that everything I do can change lives.\u201d"

Heather Knight remains an unappreciated inspirational captain, Dunkley a brilliant young cricketer and Ecclestone a superstar. I\u2019m going to bed before I get sucked into South Africa v India - Deepti has just bowled a beauty and South Africa are 2-0 after two overs. Thanks for all the emails, see you on Wednesday at an ungodly hour!     5.58am    Sophia Dunkley wins the player of the match award for that 67 off 72 balls on a slow pitch. Bangladesh finish seventh in the table in their first World Cup, and with more exposure will come increased ambition.  And finally, Raf\u2019s maths says that \u201cEngland are through and probably 3rd. India would need to bowl South Africa out for 147* to overhaul them on NRR.\u201d That chase is about to start over in Christchurch.  Updated at 5.59am BST    5.52am    Ok - so as for the semi-finals... England join Australia and South Africa, and will be joined by one of India or West Indies, depending on the result in Christchurch later on today. If, as looks likely, India beat South Africa then we are looking at South Africa v England at Wellington on Wednesday and <i>Australia v India at Christchurch on Thursday.</i> but nothing is yet certain....     5.45am   WICKET! Ritu c Cross b Davies 11 (Bangladesh 134 all out) England win by 100 runs  48th over : Bangladesh 134 all out (Jahanara 3) An over-pitched ball from Davies is cover-carved by Ritu for four, before she shovels to mid-off and that is that!       5.40am    47th over : Bangladesh 129-9 ( Ritu 7, Jahanara 2) Dean whizzes through another.     5.39am    46th over : Bangladesh 128-9 ( Ritu 7, Jahanara 1) We glance at the England team who look as if they\u2019ve all been put in cold storage. Katherine Brunt, incidentally, is no-where to be seen and has been off the field for two thirds of this innings.  India have finished 274-7 over in Christchurch. I will be getting back to you on the semi-finals, belatedly, too much happening!     5.36am   WICKET! Fahima run-out 0 (Bangladesh 128-8)  Bangladesh fly for a quick single, Wyatt flings the ball in to Jones, who takes it a foot above the stumps but whips the bails off and Fahima is out by a nose.      5.33am    45th over : Bangladesh 127-8 ( Ritu 7, Fahima 0) Dean finishes a productive over. On comms, Alex Hartley points out that if Dean pockets the last two wickets, she\u2019ll have an international five-fer before Sophie Ecclestone.     5.31am   WICKET!  Nahida b Dean 0 (Bangladesh 127-8)  Yorked! Nahida can\u2019t get bat on a straight one and the stumps are coconut shied.     5.29am   WICKET! Lata  c Cross b Dean  30 (Bangladesh 126-7)  An emboldened Lata goes big but can only slop the ball to Cross at mid-on. Sweep to disaster in this game.      5.27am    44th over : Bangladesh 126-6 ( Lata 30, Ritu 7) With 109 need off 36 balls this is all rather a formality, but Lata looking impressively frisky with the bat.     5.26am    43rd over : Bangladesh 122-6 ( Lata 28, Ritu 5) A couple of runs off the smiling Dean.  \u201cHi Tanya, just to say hi from Bahia! Got home now after a good night dancing to some great samba... just caught up with the score. All will be well right? Am not even gonna talk about the boys, the girls are gonna do it, aren\u2019t they? Beijos Cressida\u201d Cressida, is Bahia, northern Brazil? One day I\u2019ll come dancing in the small hours to the great samba with you. In the mean time, rest those dancing feet.     5.22am    42nd over : Bangladesh 121-6 ( Lata 28, Ritu 4) A sudden glut for Bangladesh, and Lata, as two boundaries come off Davies over: a cut and a lofted drive which beats a stodgy jam roly-poly bit of fielding on the rope.     5.19am    41st over : Bangladesh 112-6 ( Lata 20, Ritu 3) Knight whips through an over, and gets away with a full toss.      5.16am    40th over : Bangladesh 108-6 ( Lata 17, Ritu 2) The boundary shackles are broken, as Lata pulls Davies to the rope. A vague run-out chance, but the throw isn\u2019t pin-point and Ritu gets back.     5.13am    39th over : Bangladesh 102-6 ( Lata 12, Ritu 1) The game slip-slides away.     5.10am   WICKET! Salma c Davies b Knight 2 (Bangladesh 101-6)  Yet another top-edged sweep, yet another catch for Davies!  Updated at 5.12am BST    5.09am    38th over : Bangladesh 101-5 ( Lata 12, Salma 1) Ecclestone finishes her sublime spell with a maiden and figures of 10-4-15-3.     5.07am    37th over : Bangladesh 101-5 ( Lata 12, Salma 1) Five pinched singles off Knight.     5.05am    36th over : Bangladesh 96-5 (Lata 9, Salma 0) Tis Ecclestone, doing what Ecclestone does: long sleeves, flash of cream across her nose and... yes... another wicket! She currently has 3-15. \u201cGreetings from sunny Wellington! Very much enjoying my first ever Women\u2019s ODI today, especially the way it seems to be going. Bangladesh are running out of time and ideas. Jones doing an exceptional job standing up to the stumps for Davies. \u201cDo we know yet which teams play at which venue in the semis? Hoping to come back on Wednesday to see England at the Basin but websites are being very coy about how it all shakes out!\u201d You lucky thing, Ed Kay - looks like a great atmosphere. As far as I know the semi-finals look like this (to be continued...)  Updated at 5.07am BST    5.01am   WICKET! Jota c Davies b Ecclestone 22 (Bangladesh 96-5)  A top-edged sweep swooped and held at short-fine leg by a smiling Davies  Updated at 5.02am BST    4.57am    35th over : Bangladesh 95-4( Joty 22, Lata 8) A mere single from Knight as the players gather for the last DRINKS break o the match. I think we can safely say England have won this game as Bangladesh plump for batting out the overs rather than risk-taking.     4.55am    34th over : Bangladesh 94-4( Joty 22, Lata 7)     4.52am    33rd over : Bangladesh 91-4( Joty 22, Lata 4) Heather Knight twirls her arm over, the wind buffeting her long-sleeved jumper. Tap, tap, tap, Bangladesh bundle through their singles as the dog side-eyes me for accidentally kicking her.  \u201cJust trying to wake you up from Brisbane,\u201d bellows Evelyn Williams, \u201cwhere I\u2019m following the OBO while preparing to go to an NRL game (Queensland derby - Broncos v Cowboys). Good time for us to watch the cricket but sometimes other sports interfere.\u201d Enjoy! And thanks for the ear tweak, my eyelids are definitely struggling tonight.  Updated at 4.54am BST    4.47am    31st over: Bangladesh 87-4( Joty 20, Lata 1) A fistful of runs off Dean. \u2018Hi Tanya,\u201d Finbar Anslow, hello! \u201cHow are you doing, have woken up impossibly early having foolishly volunteered to help with the breakfast at a local boarding school, have also been fiendishly robbed of another hour\u2019s sleep by some faceless beauracrat; please give me some good news.\u201d I hope you are rewarded with a beautiful dawn and freshly-brewed coffee. Good news, you say? In this tainted world, the best I can come up with is that England are going to make the semi-finals, having picked their campaign out of the dust. Shall we ignore events in Grenada?     4.41am    30th over: Bangladesh 81-4( Joty 16, Lata 0) Lovely bowling by Davies, justly rewarded as Bangladesh start to slip and slide.     4.39am   WICKTE! Rumana b Davies 6 (Bangladesh 81-4)  Rumana flings the bat and gets only an inside edge onto the stumps. An offcutter to smooch to.     4.36am    29th over: Bangladesh 78-3 ( Joty 16, Rumana 4) I love New Zealand grounds - cricket perfection. Kids running around on the grass, friends picnicking while chewing the cud.      4.34am    28th over: Bangladesh 76-3 ( Joty 15, Rumana 3) Just a single from Davies\u2019s over at idyllic, green, green Wellington     4.32am    27th over: Bangladesh 75-3 ( Joty 14, Rumana 3)) A wicket for Dean and then a small flurry of runs as Joty flings the back and edges behind. Mine eyes are heavy - if you\u2019re out there, do drop me a mail for a chat about this and that.     4.27am   WICKET! PInky c Sciver b Dean 11 (Bangladesh 70-3)  Step and drive to mid-on, where Sciver is lurking.     4.26am    26th over: Bangladesh 69-2 (Pinky 11, Joty 11) Davies, in for the rested Shrubsole, hair tied back in a high ponytail, bounds in: a wide and three runs through mid-wicket and fine-leg. Some helpful confirmation from the radio - whichever of India or England win their game (assuming they do) by a bigger margin will avoid Australia in the semis.  Updated at 4.28am BST    4.21am    25th over: Bangladesh 65-2 (Pinky 8, Joty 11) Joty sweeps a laggardly leg-side ball from Dean for four, and repeats off the last ball, with the same result.  Updated at 4.28am BST    4.18am    24th over: Bangladesh 57-2 (Pinky 8, Joty 3) Freya Davies has a bowl in her first competitive game since February 8. Short steps, like a horse dancing, as she approaches the crease. Five dots, and just a couple off the last ball as Pinky tipples her off her pads.   Updated at 4.28am BST    4.13am    23rd over: Bangladesh 55-2 (Pinky 6, Joty 3) Dean in her sunglasses zips through another over, and a watchful Bangladesh pick up four singles.     4.11am    22nd over: Bangladesh 51-2 (Pinky 4, Joty 1) An Ecclestone maiden, as Pinky edges just short of Knight at slip.     4.10am    21st over: Bangladesh 51-2 (Pinky 4, Joty 1) Knight throws the ball to young Charlie Dean and Bangladesh are characteristically cautious. A single here, a single there, dib-dab as the run-rate disappears sky-ward.     4.07am    20th over: Bangladesh 49-2 (Pinky 3, Joty 0) Pinky picks up a couple through point, but another smashing over from Ecclestone: England\u2019s not-at-all secret, but highly effective weapon.  Updated at 4.08am BST    4.04am   WICKET! Shamima c Cross b Ecclestone 23 (Bangladesh 47-2)  Scoreboard pressure gnaws away at Shamima who throws the bat at Ecclestone but only sends the ball up and to Cross at mid-off.  Updated at 4.08am BST    4.02am    19th over: Bangladesh 47-1 (Pinky 1, Shamima 23) At this stage, the TV stats tell us, England were 68-2. A better over for Bangladesh though, as they pick up five, with Shamima swinging for glory, but not making the rope as the balls slows before the rope.     3.58am    18th over: Bangladesh 42-1 (Pinky 0, Shamima 19) A wicket maiden for Ecclestone, as she collects her 12th wicket of the World Cup and they pause for drinks.     3.54am   WICKET! Supta b Ecclestone 23 (Bangladesh 42-1)  Skids off that shiny pitch and through the defences  Updated at 3.56am BST    3.53am    17th over: Bangladesh 42-0 (Supta 23, Shamima 19) Another boundary as Shamima throws the kitchen sink at Cross and the ball flies over mid-wicket and over the rope.     3.49am    16th over: Bangladesh 37-0 (Supta 22, Shamima 15) Shot of the innings as Shamima shimmies down to Ecclestone and picks up and hits for four over mid-on. Four beautiful balls follow with Shamima lucky not to be snaffled and on her way.     3.46am    15th over: Bangladesh 33-0 (Supta 22, Shamima 11) I run to the kitchen to find something -anything- to eat and return, disappointingly, with a hastily-grabbed bag of Krisprolls. Just in time to see Cross collect four from a thick edge though the slips.     3.41am    14th over: Bangladesh 29-0 (Supta 18, Shamima 11) Shamima defends Ecclestone, then misses a sweep, mistimes a hit over midwicket and returns to first gear.Another maiden.  Updated at 3.43am BST    3.39am    13th over: Bangladesh 29-0 (Supta 18, Shamima 11) Cross fiddles with her hair and bounds in, all sports\u2019 captain enthusiasm. Only a couple of singles and Bangladesh are at risk of becoming marooned here.   Updated at 3.42am BST    3.37am    12th over: Bangladesh 27-0 (Supta 17, Shamima 10) The first drop of the innings as Danni Wyatt sprints in at deep square to pick up Shamima\u2019s top-edged sweep, but fluffs it uncharacteristically, I think it flies off her thumb. Ecclestone turns pensively.     3.34am    11th over: Bangladesh 23-0 (Supta 17, Shamima 8) A bustling Cross, moves through her first over without incident.     3.29am    10th over: Bangladesh 23-0 (Supta 16, Shamima 7) Ladies and gentlemen, we have spin. Ecclestone, in sunglasses and long-sleeves has the ball, long blond plait creeping down her back. Shamima picks up a couple from a top-edged sweep and that\u2019s the end of the power play with England well on top.     3.25am    9th over: Bangladesh 20-0 (Supta 15, Shamima 5) Shamima is batting like a woman nervously prodding the long grass for snakes. Another maiden for Brunt folded neatly and tucked into her trouser pocket.      3.22am    8th over: Bangladesh 20-0 (Supta 15, Shamima 5) Suddenly delicious for Bangladesh, as Supta on-drives and square-drives for four in successive balls as Sciver over-pitches.   Updated at 3.24am BST    3.18am    7th over: Bangladesh 12-0 (Supta 7, Shamima 5) The pitch is mirror shiny, the sky blue and the cool wind running in behind Katherine Brunt, who serves up another maiden.  Updated at 3.24am BST    3.15am    6th over: Bangladesh 12-0 (Supta 7, Shamima 5) Ooof, a nasty top edge into Shamima\u2019s grill as she tries to pull Sciver but miscues. The physio runs out and does the usual checks and all is ticked off to carry on.   Updated at 3.24am BST    3.10am    5th over: Bangladesh 11-0 (Supta 7, Shamima 4)Brunt has ants in her pants this afternoon, fizzing with aggression as she rattles along. Just a couple of runs from her over as Bangladesh start most sedately.     3.05am    4th over: Bangladesh 9-0 (Supta 5, Shamima 4) Over in Christchurch, India are making hay - 91 for one after 15 overs, though Shafali Verma has just been run out for 53. Should India win at a suitable clip, they can overtake England\u2019s net run-rate and England could find themselves facing Australia in the semi-finals. Sciver rattles through a second maiden.      3.02am    3rd over: Bangladesh 9-0 (Supta 5, Shamima 4) A maiden from Brunt, marred by a strangely aggressive throw from Brunt to Supta after her fifth ball, which a surprised Supta blocks away. Brunt is suitably chastised by the umpire.      3.00am    2nd over: Bangladesh 9-0 (Supta 5, Shamima 4) Sciver gets the new ball at the other end, in the absence of Shrubsole who has been rested. The win predictor hands England a whopping 94 per cent chance as Sciver is on the money straight away.     2.55am    1st over: Bangladesh 5-0 (Supta 4, Shamima 1)Bangladesh start with the dodgiest of singles but Dunkley uncharacteristically freezes in the covers and throws to the wrong end so a dead-cert run out becomes a just-in run. Brunt\u2019s final ball is shimmied into the leg side for four.     2.50am    Right, here we go. Katherine Brunt has the ball and we\u2019re off.     2.47am    Thanks Jim and welcome to British Summer Time! England have celebrated in pretty good time- my hunch says 235 is too many for Bangladesh, admirably though they stuck to their task. Admittedly, my hunch has been wrong before. Win this, remember, and England are through to the semi-finals.      2.41am    That\u2019s it from me. I\u2019ve just glanced at the clock and become very confused by the clocks whizzing forward an hour. The brilliant Tanya Aldred is here to take you through Bangladesh\u2019s chase - if England can stop them hauling down the target of 235 runs then the semi-finals await.  Thanks for your company, goodbye!     2.38am    Here\u2019s some interval reading on the star of England\u2019s innings:       2.37am         2.23am   50th over: England 234-6 (Brunt 24, Ecclestone 17)  The last ball of the innings brings the first six for England! Sophie Ecclestone getting a good contact on a swipe into the leg side. England finish strongly but credit to Bangladesh who bowled and fielded well and kept to their task admirably. Game on!      2.17am    49th over: England 221-6 (Brunt 21, Ecclestone 6) One over to go, England more or less throwing the Belfast at everything.      2.14am   Wicket! Dunkley st Nigar Sultana b Salma Khatun 67  End of a highly impressive innings. Dunkley trots down the wicket to heave one away into the leg side but misses the ball and is out by acres as Sultana swishes off the bails. The young batter has got England into a solid position with that knock.  48th over: England 214-6 (Brunt 20, Ecclestone 2)     2.10am    47th over: England 210-5 (Dunkley 67, Brunt 18) Dunkley on the attack once more, she rocks back and pulls for four. Another fruitful over for England is worth nine runs to the total.      2.06am    46th over: England 201-5 (Dunkley 60, Brunt 16) 14 scrappy runs from the over! Mis-cued hoicks, mis-timed drives and misfortune for the bowler as a series of edges fly away.      2.01am    45th over: England 187-5 (Dunkley 54, Brunt 8) England pick up seven off the over. Five to go - what can they get up to here? Anything 230 or above would help them breathe a bit easier when they take the field.   Updated at 2.06am BST    12.59am    44th over: England 180-5 (Dunkley 50, Brunt 5) Fifty for Sophia Dunkley! She\u2019s played a gem of an innings here. She gets there with another drive to the cover fence and a well judged single. Well batted!     12.55am    43rd over: England 172-5 (Dunkley 44, Brunt 3) Katherine Brunt is the new batter. This is definitely worth a read:       12.50am   Wicket! Jones ct Salma Khatun b Lata Mondal 31 (England 168-5)  Gone this time though! Jones leans back on a drive and is caught at cover.      12.47am    42nd over: England 168-4 (Jones 31, Dunkley 44) Drop! Jones gets a meaty edge to a wide-ish ball from Nahida but the keeper can\u2019t cling on stood up to the stumps.      12.44am    41st over: England 167-4 (Jones 30, Dunkley 44) Back to medium-pace as Jahanara returns to the attack. Amy Jones drives her on the up through the covers for four! Shot of the day for my moolah. Dunkley then finds the fence with a powerfully struck drive. 12 from the over, England on the move.      12.39am    40th over: England 155-4 (Jones 25, Dunkley 37) Four off Salma\u2019s seventh over. Big final ten overs. England have a chance to go through the gears here with six wickets still in hand.      12.36am    39th over: England 151-4 (Jones 24, Dunkley 34) Shot! Dunkley launches a drive over the fielders and holds the pose. If you can\u2019t get through \u2018em... go over \u2018em. Singles worked off the rest.  Fifty-partnership for Jones and Dunkley. 150 up for England.   Updated at 12.37am GMT    12.33am    38th over: England 143-4 (Jones 22, Dunkley 28) Just a couple from it, Dunkley drives powerfully a couple of times but finds the fielder on both occasions.      12.28am    37th over: England 141-4 (Jones 21, Dunkley 27) Seven from the over, this pair beginning to up the intent slightly, rotating the strike well.      12.26am    36th over: England 134-4 (Jones 19, Dunkley 24) Salma Khatun is back into the attack, Dunkley manages to back-cut her away for four. The youngster is playing another meaningful innings here.      12.22am    35th over: England 129-4 (Jones 18, Dunkley 18) Roly-poly-ever-so-slowly. Just a single to Amy Jones.      12.19am    34th over: England 128-4 (Jones 17, Dunkley 18) Three taken from Rumana\u2019s over. Lydia Greenway on comms wants Dunkley and Jones to keep rotating strike until at least 40 overs before having a dart.       12.15am    33rd over: England 125-4 (Jones 16, Dunkley 18) Buzzers! Dunkley picks up a bonus few runs thanks to some sloppy backing-up straight away after drinks. One-becomes-three as the Spice Girls didn\u2019t sing.      12.10am    32nd over: England 121-4 (Jones 15, Dunkley 15) Drinks. Single to each batter off the new bowler, leg-spinner Rumana Ahmed. 18 overs to go and England need to finish strongly in the last third of their innings. It\u2019s been tough going so far. Bangladesh have been impressive.    Updated at 12.11am GMT    12.05am    31st over: England 119-4 (Jones 14, Dunkley 14) Dunkley releases the pressure valve ever so slightly with a lofted drive over mid-on for four. Shot! Better over for England with seven taken from it. Ritu Moni finishes with 1-36 from her ten overs.  Updated at 12.06am GMT    12.03am    30th over: England 108-4 (Jones 11, Dunkley 10) There have been 105 dots so far in the innings and just the six boundaries. It\u2019s been another constriction job by Bangladesh. 20 overs to go.       12.01am    29th over: England 108-4 (Jones 10, Dunkley 7) Just a single to Dunkley.       11.58pm    28th over: England 107-4 (Jones 10, Dunkley 6) Sophia Dunkley sweeps for four. Two new batters at the crease and at the risk of a JINX they both look in good knick, reading the pace of the pitch well and playing their shots confidently.      11.55pm    27th over: England 100-4 (Jones 9, Dunkley 0)      11.51pm   Wicket! Sciver lbw b Fahima Khatun 40  Sweep for four by Sciver. Welcome boundary. England\u2019s first since the 17th. Amy Jones then makes it another with a fantastic in-to-out drive through the covers. BUT then Nat Sciver is given out on review! WOW. It looked innocuous, Sciver was down the track and looking to flick away but she missed the ball and Bangladesh review more in hope... but three reds and it is whoops of delight for the fielding side. Sciver can\u2019t believe it. She shakes her head as she departs for the hutch.  26th over: England 96-4 (Jones 5, Dunkley 0)   Updated at 11.53pm GMT    11.44pm    25th over: England 86-2 (Sciver 35, Jones) Wicket maiden for Ritu Moni. She has 1-24 from seven overs. Amy Jones is the new batter. we\u2019re halfway through. Cagey. Cautious. Can England creep to a par score?      11.41pm   Wicket! Beaumont ct Fahima Khatun b Ritu Moni 33 (England 86-3)  Call me Nostrajamus... Beaumont tried to go aerial but her bottom hand comes off the bat and she plinks to cover. 69 balls for her 33, a patient but largely frustrating knock for the opener.      11.38pm    24th over: England 86-2 (Beaumont 33, Sciver 35) Three singles. Get the feeling Beaumont is starting to get frustrated here. She keeps finding the fielders.      11.35pm    23rd over: England 83-2 (Beaumont 31, Sciver 34) No fireworks but five singles.       11.32pm    22nd over: England 78-2 (Beaumont 28, Sciver 32) Four singles, England happy to cautiously compile. As an aside - Bangladesh have never chased more than 211 runs in a fifty over match.      11.28pm    21st over: England 74-2 (Beaumont 26, Sciver 30) A late, teasingly late cut by Sciver, so late she basically glided it out of the keeper\u2019s gloves. She has finesse to go with the power and will need all of it on this slightly stodgy wicket.      11.25pm    20th over: England 70-2 (Beaumont 25, Sciver 27) Nearly a run out! A quick single results in Tammy Beaumont on the turf enacting a full length dive for her ground. It would have been close, as it happens Nahida missed the stumps after she\u2019d gathered the ball at the non-strikers end.   Updated at 11.28pm GMT    11.22pm    19th over: England 68-2 (Beaumont 24, Sciver 26) Sciver goes for a big yahoooo into the leg side, the ball goes soaring and swirling in the wind... and lands safe.      11.19pm    18th over: England 64-2 (Beaumont 23, Sciver 23) England happy to nudge and nurdle. Bangladesh happy for them to do so.       11.17pm    17th over: England 60-2 (Beaumont 21, Sciver 22) The BIG shot does come! Nat Sciver drives over the top for four. Lovely, she kept her shape and was always in control. There\u2019s a couple of singles too but Ritu gets out of the over with three dots.      11.13pm    16th over: England 54-2 (Beaumont 20, Sciver 17) Still no boundaries coming for England, there\u2019s a slight sense of frustration creeping in, especially for Nat Sciver. Wonder if a big shot is in the offing. That\u2019s exactly want Bangladesh want of course.      11.09pm    15th over: England 51-2 (Beaumont 18, Sciver 16) Fifty up for England. Both batters are just struggling to get used to the pace of the wicket. The ball isn\u2019t coming on, especially as Ritu Moni is just placing it on a length, stump to stump. Stifling stuff.      11.03pm    14th over: England 47-2 (Beaumont 16, Sciver 14) Drinks. A cagey first installment of this game. Someone is going to take it by the scruff of the neck in the next hour or so. Time for a brew.      11.00pm    13th over: England 44-2 (Beaumont 15, Sciver 12) Just a single off Ritu\u2019s first. Bit of a plod so far for England, they are going at 3.38 runs per over.   Updated at 11.01pm GMT    10.56pm    12th over: England 43-2 (Beaumont 15, Sciver 11) England can\u2019t break the shackles. Ritu Moni is going to float down some medium pacers with the keeper stood up to the stumps.      10.52pm    11th over: England 39-2 (Beaumont 14, Sciver 8) Just a couple from the over. 19 year old left-arm spinner Nahida Akter is coming into the attack.     10.47pm    10th over: England 37-2 (Beaumont 13, Sciver 7) Powerplay done and dusted. Sciver looks busy, cutting and driving to pick up five from the over. The suns is fully out now in Wellington, so that\u2019s something.      10.45pm    9th over: England 32-2 (Beaumont 12, Sciver 3) Beaumont picks up two with a well placed clip through mid-wicket. She\u2019s been consistent in this World Cup without yet posting a match defining score. Today Tammy eh?  Updated at 10.45pm GMT    10.42pm    8th over: England 30-2 (Beaumont 10, Sciver 3) Two early wickets gone for England then, that won\u2019t settle the jitters. Nat Sciver is the new batter and she\u2019s into her work with a single to fine leg and a whip off the pads for two.      10.39pm   Wicket! Knight ct Nigar Sultana b Salma Khatun  The captain is gone! Caught by her opposite number behind the stumps. Salma Khatun bowled her the doosra and it was too close too cut, a spike on the snicko betrays Knight and she has to trudge off.      10.36pm    7th over: England 24-1 (Beaumont 9, Knight 4) Just a couple from a Knight sweep. Bangladesh bowling tidily, keeping the pressure on England.   Updated at 10.41pm GMT    10.30pm         10.29pm    6th over: England 20-1 (Beaumont 9, Knight 4) Cat and mouse stuff from Salma and Tammy Beaumont, the batter looking to attack but the bowler landing the ball on a dime. A paddle to the vacant \u201845 area brings a couple. The pitch looks a bit two-paced, Nasser reckons a score of 220 would be decent.   Updated at 10.41pm GMT    10.25pm    5th over: England 18-1 (Beaumont 7, Knight 1) Skipper Knight is at the crease early again. She\u2019s off the mark immediately with a flick to mid-wicket for a leisurely single.   Updated at 10.41pm GMT    10.23pm   WICKET! Wyatt ct Fahima Khatun b Jahanara Alam 6 (England 16-1)  Gone! England lose Wyatt - scything in the air to point and the catch is taken! England remain the only side in the tournament not to post an opening partnership of fifty so far in the tournament.   Updated at 10.24pm GMT    10.21pm    4th over: England 14-0 (Beaumont 7, Wyatt 6) Tight over from Salma, just a Wyatt single off it.   England will go through with a win. How they do it, net run-rate wise could affect who they end up playing in the semis, with obviously Australia the side to avoid. Whoever finishes in fourth place will face Meg Lanning and co. At the moment it could be England, India or, if one of those two lose today, West Indies.      10.14pm         10.13pm    3rd over: England 13-0 (Beaumont 7, Wyatt 5) A nicely timed push for two through the covers from Beaumont brings the only runs from the over.     10.10pm    2nd over: England 11-0 (Beaumont 5, Wyatt 5) Salma Khatun\u2019s spin. Salma starts with four dots before she drops short and Wyatt pounces to carve her square for four.   Updated at 10.11pm GMT    10.06pm    1st over: England 7-0 (Beaumont 5, Wyatt 1) Beaumont nudges one into leg to get England\u2019s cause underway. Jahanara struggles with her run up slightly as she did in the windy conditions against Australia. It looks a lot brighter and less blustery in Wellington today. Wyatt gets off the mark with a single too. Four! Beaumont drives through cover for the first boundary of the game. England are up \u2018n\u2019 runnin.      10.02pm    Danni Wyatt and Tammy Beaumont take guard on this used Wellington wicket. Jahanara Alam has the ball in hand. Let\u2019s play!     9.56pm    The players head out for the anthems. There\u2019s just about enough blue sky to make a sailor a pair of trousers, as my ol\u2019 Ma would say. No idea either, she lives in landlocked Derbyshire.      9.52pm    Nasser says it is \u201ccloudy, windy and cold\u201d in Wellington.   Speaking of Nasser...     9.50pm    England: Tammy Beaumont, Danielle Wyatt, *Heather Knight, Natalie Sciver, +Amy Jones, Sophia Dunkley, Katherine Brunt, Sophie Ecclestone, Kate Cross, Charlotte Dean, Freya Davies. Bangladesh: Sharmin Akhter, Shamima Sultana, Fargana Hoque, *+Nigar Sultana, Rumana Ahmed, Ritu Moni, Lata Mondal, Salma Khatun, Fahima Khatun, Nahida Akter, Jahanara Alam.      9.46pm   England win the toss...  They\u2019ll have a bat     9.44pm   Preamble  Hello and welcome to the night of nights for England\u2019s female cricketers. A win against Bangladesh, who incidentally they have never met before in 50 over cricket, will see them grab a spot in the semi-finals.  It\u2019s been a topsy-turvy campaign by England. They were gaping down the barrel of an early World Cup Exit after three defeats at the start of the tournament, ever since then it\u2019s been pressure on - effectively playing elimination cricket in every match since.  Heather Knight will be desperately hoping that her side\u2019s 2022 World Cup journey in New Zealand continues to go the way of the tortoise and the hare. That their ugly duckling early performances of dropped catches and wayward bowling continue to transform into something swan-like as the competition reaches the sharp end. Lose against Bangladesh today though and it will be Goodnight, Moon.  The signs are promising, some of those who had been having a \u2018quieter\u2019 time of it have stepped up. Danni Wyatt was in the runs and Katherine Brunt the wickets in the defeat of Pakistan. Kate Cross, Sophie Ecclestone, Nat Sciver and Sophia Dunkley have all performed consistently, so to the skipper herself.  \u201cEveryone is peaking at the right time going into this game and then hopefully the semi-finals\u2026 it\u2019s not how you start, it\u2019s how you finish,\u201d declared opener Tammy Beaumont in the run up to today\u2019s match at the Basin Reserve in Wellington.  They won\u2019t be taking Bangladesh lightly. Nigar Sultana\u2019s side have beaten Pakistan and pushed both West Indies and India close. They nearly pulled off the shock of the tournament at a blustery Basin Reserve just a couple of days ago, reducing the unbeaten Aussies to 70-5 chasing a tricksy target of 135. If they\u2019d been more proactive with the bat earlier on the piece then they could have pulled off a spectacular upset. They have a spin contingent that could damage England, especially with all the pressure on pale blue shoulders. I predict a bum-squeaker.  Play starts at 10pm GMT/11 AM local time. Jim here with the call for the first half before Tanya takes over in the wee small hours. I\u2019ll be back shortly with news of the toss and the teams. As ever do get in touch with your musings and mirth. You can whang me an email or fling me a tweet.  "

                    "body": "Good morning. Last year, the Cop26 climate summit in Glasgow kept alive the target of holding global temperatures to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels; but, conference president Alok Sharma said, \u201cits pulse is weak\u201d. The vital question for the Cop27 summit at Sharm-el-Sheikh in Egypt, which began yesterday, is whether it will prove to be an emergency room or a hospice. If Cop27 is to have any chance of renewing global commitments after a year of extremely limited progress, the work of the negotiators who will take over once world leaders have departed at the end of today will be crucial. I spoke to the Guardian\u2019s environment correspondent Fiona Harvey about the fascinating, byzantine, surprisingly dramatic and extremely nerdy process of climate diplomacy \u2013 and why, as deeply frustrating as it might be, it matters so much. That\u2019s after the headlines. And a quick note to say that I\u2019m off the rest of this week \u2013 Nimo and recurring guest star Dan Milmo will be in your inbox. Five big stories  Economy | Jeremy Hunt will announce \u00a325bn worth of tax rises and \u00a335bn in spending cuts at the autumn statement, the Guardian understands. The scale of the measures has grown significantly after the Bank of England\u2019s dire forecasts last week of the longest recession since the 1930s. Ukraine | The Biden administration has reportedly warned Kyiv that allies\u2019 \u201cUkraine fatigue\u201d could worsen if Volodymyr Zelenskiy continues to be closed to negotiations with Russia. Climate crisis | An assessment by Carbon Brief has found the US, UK and Canada have fallen billions of dollars short of their \u201cfair share\u201d of climate funding for low-income countries. This comes after the UN\u2019s World Meteorological Organization said the past eight years were the eight hottest ever recorded, putting the internationally agreed 1.5C limit for global heating \u201cbarely within reach\u201d. Politics | Rishi Sunak is facing further questions over his political judgment after it emerged he was made aware of a complaint against his political ally Gavin Williamson before appointing him. Sunak was said to have been unaware of the contents of hostlile texts sent to former chief whip Wendy Morton. Housing | More than 138,000 properties in England and Wales are owned by offshore companies. In London the offshore holdings are worth as much as \u00a355bn.  In depth: \u2018It\u2019s awful and frustrating \u2013 but you can\u2019t solve the climate crisis without Cop\u2019  There are \u201cperiods of intense activity and huge longueurs\u201d at climate summits, says Fiona Harvey in Sharm-el-Sheikh; happily, I reach her during one of the longueurs. She emphasises that this is not a \u201cdecision summit\u201d like Glasgow. Instead, the focus will be on holding countries accountable for their commitments last year against the backdrop of the global energy crisis brought about by Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. In this piece from May, UN climate adviser Rachel Kyte describes the task as \u201cimplementation, implementation, implementation\u201d. \u201cWe won\u2019t get an agreement or a new treaty at the end of it,\u201d Fiona said. \u201cBut it\u2019s incredibly important we see progress.\u201d This piece explains why it\u2019s looking so tough, while this one sets out the vital importance of \u201closs and damage\u201d financing for developing nations \u2013 which was finally confirmed as part of the agenda for the talks after \u201cfractious\u201d discussions that dragged late into the night and delayed the opening of the conference proper. In the Guardian\u2019s Down to Earth newsletter (sign up here for twice-weekly updates throughout Cop27), Fiona writes: \u201cThis year\u2019s Cop will be arguably the hardest yet.\u201d The only path to success is through the endless minutiae of negotiation \u2013 \u201ca lot of horrible absurdity\u201d, Fiona said. \u201cPeople arguing in rooms for hours.\u201d Here\u2019s how it works. *** What is the framework for the summit?  \u201cThe first two days are about world leaders being there and having their photos taken and talking,\u201d Fiona said. \u201cAfter that, the negotiators get on with it. In the second week, next Tuesday, we get the \u2018high-level segment\u2019 \u2013 that\u2019s when ministers join the talks.\u201d All Cop summits take place under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, a treaty agreed almost 30 years ago. Everything that happens in Sharm-el-Sheikh \u2013 \u201cthe fact of the meeting, setting the agenda, the texts agreed at the end of it\u201d \u2013 is a product of the UNFCCC. \u201cIt was a massive achievement,\u201d Fiona said. \u201cIt is full of frustrations, but you can\u2019t redraw it now \u2013 you just wouldn\u2019t get people to sign up to it. The important thing is that it means that once things are agreed, countries have a legal obligation to see them through.\u201d *** Who are the negotiators? Countries are represented individually, but blocs of nations with common interests \u2013 like the Africa Group, the Least Developed Countries, and the Small Island Developing States \u2013 seek to increase their negotiating power by clubbing together. \u201cThe big countries have teams of negotiators who do nothing all year round but these talks,\u201d Fiona said. \u201cThey will have someone in every workstream, in every room. The poorer ones can\u2019t do that \u2013 they will send one country to one event, another to another, and compare notes.\u201d For a sense of what it\u2019s like negotiating on behalf of those most vulnerable to the impact of the climate crisis, see this riveting fly-on-the-wall account of the work of Giza Gaspar-Martins, chair of the Least Developed Countries group at the Paris summit in 2015. He dashes from meeting to meeting across the impractically vast site, pausing only to \u201ctalk to my wife\u201d (smoke a cigarette) and \u201cdo the things I cannot delegate\u201d (go to the loo). *** What do they negotiate over? \u201cIt\u2019s hilarious on one level, awful on another,\u201d Fiona said. \u201cIt just sounds incomprehensible to anyone outside of this bizarre bubble. There are non-papers, \u2018informal informals\u2019, acres of square brackets, rows about the placements of semicolons. They sit for hours hammering it all out.\u201d But these arcane points really matter. As Giza Gaspar-Martins says of a draft of the final Paris agreement: \u201cWe need to do some detective work. Some good brains have been working hard to hide things in here.\u201d Also in Paris, a last-minute row over whether a \u201cshall\u201d ought to have been a \u201cshould\u201d was only resolved with the dubious claim that a \u201ctypographical error\u201d had been made, allowing the US to overlook a stronger commitment than it wanted on mitigation efforts in the final text. (Here\u2019s a terrific account of that drama by the Guardian\u2019s then-environment editor John Vidal.) In Glasgow, Alok Sharma fought back tears as he apologised to delegates over a late change, forced by China and India, changed a commitment to \u201cphase out\u201d coal to the looser promise to \u201cphase down\u201d its use. \u201cDid I appreciate we had to adjust one thing tonight in a very unusual way?\u201d John Kerry said afterwards. \u201cNo. But if we hadn\u2019t done that, we wouldn\u2019t have a deal.\u201d *** How do these agreements get reached? The country holding the presidency \u2013 Egypt this year \u2013 will assign countries responsibility for managing negotiations over particular areas. \u201cThere\u2019s an \u2018ad hoc working group\u2019 for every key part of the process that will meet in their own little rooms,\u201d Fiona said. \u201cSo the Cop president will say on climate finance, for example, let\u2019s have one developed and one developing country go away and convene other countries for talks.\u201d Also helpful, Fiona added, is the way the summit allows for accidental interactions of key players. \u201cThis is the only forum which puts the developing countries on a somewhat level playing field,\u201d she said. \u201cThey can catch a minister from an EU nation in a corridor, and say, with moral authority, \u2018come on, mate\u2019. That\u2019s important.\u201d None of this is very glamorous. Pictures abound from previous Cops of windowless shoeboxes with uncomfortable looking chairs shoehorned around a table covered in cold pizza and heavily annotated drafts. But it\u2019s necessary work ahead of the final stage of discussions in the plenary session, which all countries attend. *** How does the text get finally agreed? One criticism of the consensus model of the Cop summits \u2013 which sees the text agreed in a final session involving every country \u2013 is that it enforces the \u201cwill of the laggards\u201d: the argument is that is easy for countries that are reluctant to adopt crucial climate change measures to put a spanner in the works. \u201cThat\u2019s not really fair,\u201d said Fiona. \u201cThey don\u2019t get their own way all the time \u2013 they didn\u2019t in Glasgow or Paris. Saudi Arabia and Russia are happy to be the people in closed rooms making criticisms, but they don\u2019t want to put themselves out there like that. So the process of consensus can force the laggards to catch up, and it outs those who won\u2019t agree.\u201d She points to the example of Durban 2011, where the treaty that became the Paris agreement was born. \u201cEveryone was on board except China and India, and the EU forced a showdown \u2013 the talks went on for days, and in the end the EU called out China and India, and said, are you going to stand up? And they didn\u2019t.\u201d Does all of this add up to a process that meets the vast crisis already under way? Hardly. \u201cYou sit there and you talk about five-year review processes \u2013 we haven\u2019t got five bloody years,\u201d Fiona said. \u201cBut while Cop won\u2019t solve the climate crisis, you can\u2019t solve the climate crisis without Cop. It\u2019s awful and inadequate and frustrating, but it\u2019s still essential. These discussions are incredibly important because they\u2019re the only discussions we\u2019ve got.\u201d What else we\u2019ve been reading  Aaron Carter, the teen heartthrob of the noughties, was just 34 when he died this Saturday.

                    "body": "International pledges of emergency aid have poured in for Turkey and Syria, leading to calls for the international community to relax some of the political restrictions on aid entering north-west Syria, the country\u2019s last rebel-held enclave and one of the areas worst hit by the earthquake. With the support of Russia at the UN, the government in Damascus allows aid to enter the region through only one border crossing. The Syrian Association for Citizens Dignity said all crossings must be opened on an emergency basis. The crisis is likely to be a test of whether a divided international community riven by the war in Ukraine and conflicts in the Middle East can temporarily bury its differences in the interests of addressing a humanitarian emergency. The Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, who is facing an election in a few months, said offers of aid to Turkey had come from 45 countries ranging from Kuwait to Israel, Russia and the UK. Syria said it had received offers of help from China, Russia, Lebanon, Algeria and the United Arab Emirates. But the scale of the aid being offered will require a large coordination effort, as well delicate diplomatic manoeuvres to supply aid to Syria where the leadership of Bashar al-Assad is not recognised in the west. By Monday afternoon the number of dead in northern Syria had reached 840, about a half of the fast-rising death toll in Turkey of 1,541. The Syrian side of the border may provide a greater aid challenge since some of the worst-affected areas contain hundreds of thousands of Syrian refugees locked in a war zone and facing attacks from Syrian government forces. Aid agencies reported that some of the roads from Turkey into Syria were blocked, including the main cross border crossing used by international aid agencies. The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, said the US was already assessing its comprehensive response options, \u201cand had directed my team to remain in close contact with our Turkish allies and our humanitarian partners in the coming days to determine what the region needs\u201d. He added: \u201cWe are determined to do all that we can to help those affected by these earthquakes in the days, weeks, and months ahead.\u201d The EU said it had mobilised its emergency coordination centre and rescue teams in the Netherlands and Romania. The bloc\u2019s foreign affairs chief, Josep Borrell, said: \u201cTen urban search and rescue teams have been quickly mobilised from Bulgaria, Croatia, [the Czech Republic], France, Greece, the Netherlands, Poland [and] Romania to support the first responders on the ground. Italy and Hungary have offered their rescue teams to Turkey as well.\u201d The EU\u2019s Copernicus satellite system has been activated to provide emergency mapping services.  Other countries offering help included Ukraine, whose president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, sent a message offering condolences. The French President Emmanuel Macron said he was despatching a 139 strong civilian rescue team and the US announced it was sending two search and rescue teams each 79 strong. Soldiers from Azerbaijan were the fist to arrive in Turkey to offer practical support sending 400 fully equipped soldiers. Russia said it had emergency rescue Ilyushin-76 planes on standby to fly to the two countries. Its defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, ordered Russian forces in Syria to help with the rescue effort, including from the naval base at Tartus. Tobias Billstr\u00f6m, the Swedish foreign affairs minister, tweeted: \u201cI deeply regret the terrible consequences of the earthquake in Turkey and Syria with a high loss of lives. As Sweden holds the EU presidency we are going to reach out to the Turkish foreign affairs minister, Mevl\u00fct \u00c7avu\u015fo\u011flu, and to Syria for the coordination of EU efforts to aid these countries in this disaster.\u201d Sweden has been at loggerheads with Turkey over Erdo\u011fan\u2019s refusal to allow it into Nato. Erdo\u011fan\u2019s ability to oversee the crisis and to cooperate with countries that he sometimes antagonises will be a critical test for him before the presidential election due on 14 May. The opposition, seeking to capitalise on the dire state of the economy, was due to select its candidate next Monday, but depending on how the crisis unfolds in the next few days it may have to postpone making its choice. The White Helmets, the western-backed NGO that has rescued thousands of people from bombed buildings during the Syrian civil war, said adverse weather conditions including freezing temperatures had compounded the crisis. It urged the Assad regime and Russia to refrain from military activity in the affected areas to allow international groups to unify to help people affected. A spokesperson in Syria said: \u201cOur teams responded and until now many families are under the rubble. Our teams are trying hard to help all the casualties. North-west Syria is now a disaster area. We need help from everyone to save our people.\u201d Last month, the UN security council agreed to allow aid into north-west Syria from Turkey across one border crossing, at Bab al-Hawa. Syria has been resistant to allowing aid into a region serving more than 4 million people because it regards the aid as undermining Syrian sovereignty and reducing its chances of winning back control of the region. \u201cThe areas worst affected by the earthquake inside Syria look to be run by the Turkish-controlled opposition and not by the Syrian government,\u201d said Mark Lowcock, the former head of UN humanitarian affairs. \u201cIt is going to require Turkish acquiescence to get aid into those areas. It is unlikely the Syrian government will do much to help.\u201d It is hoped that the relatively sophisticated network of aid agencies that operate in Syria and southern Turkey means help can arrive relatively quickly. But the infrastructure of some of the aid groups themselves has been disrupted. The epicentre of the initial earthquake was near Gaziantep, where aid agencies including Syria Relief, the UK\u2019s largest Syria relief charity, have their offices. Video from a hospital posted by the Syrian American Medical Society (SAMS) on Monday showed it immensely crowded. The society said: \u201cOur hospitals are overwhelmed with patients filling the hallways. There is an immediate need for trauma supplies and a comprehensive emergency response to save lives and treat the injured.\u201d Initial needs are for tens of thousands tents, heaters for the tents, tens of thousands blankets, thermal clothes, ready-to-eat food and basic first aid kits. Rick Brennan, the World Health Organization\u2019s regional director of emergencies for the eastern Mediterranean, said the UN body would increase the number of its staff in Gaziantep and is looking at options for sending emergency medical teams to the region. \u201cI think we can expect the death toll to increase significantly,\u201d he said. Tanya Evans, the Syria country director for the International Rescue Committee, said: \u201cMany in north-west Syria have been displaced up to 20 times, and with health facilities strained beyond capacity even before this tragedy, many did not have access to the healthcare they critically need\u201d. She said the Syria humanitarian response plan for this year was already severely underfunded, with less than 50% of the required $4bn funded. The UK said it was sending 76 search and rescue specialists, four dogs and equipment to arrive in Turkey on Monday evening. An emergency medical team will also be sent to assess the situation on the ground. Ministers said they were in contact with the UN about the provision of emergency humanitarian support to those affected in Syria. Germany\u2019s Federal Agency for Technical Relief (THW) is preparing to deliver emergency generators, tents and blankets to Turkey. Emergency shelters and water treatment systems could also be provided, the German interior minister, Nancy Faeser, said. Greece, Israel, Egypt, Qatar and the UAE have also offered aid."

                    "body": "My friend Bill Russell, who has died aged 87, combined success in both football and teaching throughout his career. He was born in Hounslow, Middlesex (now the London borough of Hounslow), to Doris (nee Smith) and William Russell, a professional footballer and manager. Shortly afterwards, the family moved to north Wales, where William became manager of Rhyl United and Doris ran a boarding house. Bill went to Rhyl grammar school. As a result of his sporting and academic talents he was awarded one of only two national bursaries, which funded his degree in geography and German at University College Wales, Aberystwyth (now Aberystwyth University). He followed this with a one-year teacher training course at Loughborough College, Leicestershire (now Loughborough University), focusing on language teaching. Simultaneously with his university studies and afterwards, when he started teaching, Bill was a serious footballer and an athlete \u2013 he ran for Welsh Universities against Roger Bannister, then at the peak of his career, in 1954. Remaining an amateur allowed him freedom of movement between football clubs, including Bangor City, Rhyl and Manchester City reserves. In 1957 he scored the first goal, for Bishop Auckland, in the Amateur Cup final at Wembley in front of a crowd of 90,000, helping his team win the trophy. Soon afterwards he signed for Sheffield United and, over six seasons, made 175 appearances, scoring 75 goals and reaching the FA Cup semi-finals in 1961. He also won four England caps as an amateur. Alongside his football career, Bill pursued a parallel academic path, teaching languages at several schools around Manchester. After retiring from football in 1970, having also played for Bolton Wanderers, Rochdale, Scarborough and Chorley, he became head of languages at South Trafford Further Education College in Altrincham (now Trafford College). There, he met Cathie Cornish, who in 1994 became his second wife.  The following year he retired from teaching, but nearly 20 years later one of his former students contacted the \u201cthank you\u201d slot on Radio 4\u2019s Saturday Live programme to acknowledge how Bill\u2019s teaching had changed her life by helping her get into university. The fact that many old students kept in touch is another testament to his dedication. Bill returned to north Wales after his retirement, living in Dyserth, near Rhyl, where he was known for his hospitality. He then had more time to complete the Guardian\u2019s cryptic crossword every day and to add Welsh to his German and Russian, the Spanish and Italian he learned at evening classes, and self-taught Swedish.  Bill is survived by Cathie, his daughter, Mandy, from his first marriage, to Deirdre (nee Barnett), which ended in divorce, and by his grandchildren, Freddie and Max."

                    "body": "\n 2.00am  \nSummary\n\nOne of the greatest footballers to ever play the game \u2013 perhaps the greatest \u2013 has died.\nHere is our news report: \n\nAnd here is Richard Williams\u2019s long read on the great man.\n\n\n\n\n 2.00am  \n\nI\u2019m going to bring this blog to a close very soon. Beofre I go, here\u2019s an email from Ben Bagga.\n\nA boy, in Scotland, born in 1983, with no knowledge of Pel\u00e9, no elders to impart the genius or impact of the best, grew to enjoy playing football by an early age. My instinctive talent, many coaches/teammates exasperated by what I would (or try to) do, led me to believe that I didn\u2019t understand the game that I so enjoyed (I must add that I never played any higher than amateur level). I was given a video of numerous \u2018old\u2019 Brazil teams &amp; especially Pel\u00e9. Watching the instinctive skills of Pel\u00e9 showed me that football could be played in such a manner, that joy could be had (&amp; shown) within a successful football team. I realised I didn\u2019t just enjoy football, I loved it, I needed it. \nTonight I have shed more than a few tears, for the loss of someone I never knew or met, the loss of the greatest player of the game I love, the loss of an incomparable Brazilian icon &amp; more importantly the loss of an incredible person who showed, not only his family, but the world as a whole, an inconceivable amount of love &amp; joy. \n This is the first (&amp; I expect last) time that I cry due to the passing of someone not a friend or family member. Tonight my boys, (8 &amp; 4), learned of the passing of \u2018the greatest\u2019. If I have explained to them even half the reverence Pel\u00e9 had on my enjoyment, love (need) for football (the way \u2018he\u2019 played it) they will to an extent pass that on to their children.\nWith the greatest respect &amp; regret, Edison Arrantes do Nascimento has died. PELE IS ETERNAL.\n\n\n\n\n 1.46am  \n\nWhile today the tributes flow, it will not be long before Pel\u00e9\u2019s career is sliced and diced into oblivion as first-hand accounts of his greatness diminish and the fascination with anointing one true footballing deity consumes the game. Last year Barney Ronay cautioned against sidelining the Brazilian in this exercise in futility.\n\nPel\u00e9 did not have to exist. He was born as Brazilian sport was still struggling to overcome the colour bar. He played barefoot. He worked as a shoe-shiner and a vendor of stolen peanuts.\nWith nothing but talent to guide him, the boy from Minas Gerais became the first black global sporting superstar, and a source of genuine uplift and inspiration. Pel\u00e9 won the World Cup aged 17, moving like someone from the future, seeing different things, running through a different kind of air.\nThe idea he did this while somehow having it easy compared to the captive princelings of modern elite-tier football is just silly. But it is also self-defeating. The fact remains those Santos friendlies were what much of the Champions League is now, a treadmill, a way of monetising talent by showing it to the world.\nIs it harder to score a hat-trick against Atl\u00e9tico Madrid in a tour game in 1966, or against Viktoria Plzen in a hometown semi-dead rubber in 2011? Who knows. But they both definitely involve scoring a hat-trick.\nWhat is certain is that Pel\u00e9 invented this game, the idea of individual global sporting superstardom, and in a way that is unrepeatable now. Forget the giant cakes, the solid silver sombreros, the urge to sweep these icons aside. That part of him, core Pel\u00e9, is a gift to all of us. It will remain untouchable.\n\n\n\nUpdated at 1.52am GMT\n\n\n 1.35am  \n\n\nThe piece (from back in 2003) and the headline are both excellent, Simon. I especially enjoyed this paragraph. Today we mourn Edson; Pel\u00e9 is immortal.\n\nHe was born Edson Arantes do Nascimento, and often talks of Pele in the third person. It\u2019s as if they are two different people, and Edson is Pele\u2019s representative on earth, I say. \u201cYes, I feel like that. I used to go out and people said Pele! Pele! Pele! Pele! all over the world, but no one remembers Edson. Edson is the person who has the feelings, who has the family, who works hard, and Pele is the idol. Pele doesn\u2019t die. Pele will never die. Pele is going to go on for ever. But Edson is a normal person who is going to die one day, and the people forget that.\n\n\n\n\n\n 1.29am  \n\nNot unrelated to Pel\u00e9\u2019s relationship with African football was the colour of his skin. Here\u2019s Tom Phillips, The Guardian\u2019s Latin America correspondent:\n\n\n\n\n 1.24am  \n\nPel\u00e9\u2019s standing in African football seems destined to remain unchallenged. Although his oft-quoted premonition that: \u201cAn African nation will win the World Cup before the year 2000\u201d never came true, he championed football in the continent, with a succession of African stars taking his name in honour. \n\n\n\n\n 1.13am  \n\nThis particular tribute brought a lump to my throat. My own personal shorthand for footballing greatness has forever been Pel\u00e9, Maradona, and Cruyff. \n\nA good time to revisit Sad Steps by Philip Larkin. \n\n\n\n 1.06am  \n\nSuperb goal, extraordinary commentary. \n\n\n\n\n 1.01am  \n\nPel\u00e9\u2019s impact on the United States was profound, acting as a de facto ambassador for both Brazil and football. Presidents past and present have been sharing their memories. \n\n\n\n\n\n 12.57am  \n\nFans in New York have paid tribute to Pel\u00e9 who brought the curtain down on his career with a stint in the city playing for the fabled Cosmos. \u201cYou can say now to the world that soccer has finally arrived in the United States,\u201d he said when he signed his contract at the 21 Club before 200 photographers and press.\n\n\n\n\n 12.53am  \n\n\n\n\n\n 12.49am  \n\nContinuing from the previous post, Pel\u00e9 played his first match in England against Sheffield Wednesday at Hillsborough in 1962. A decade later Santos toured again, producing this memorable image:\n\nRemarkably, kick-off for this exhibition was 2.30pm on a Wednesday afternoon, a time chosen to avoid the disruption of floodlights not working during a miners strike. One can only guess at the level of truancy in South Yorkshire that day.\n\n\n\n\n 12.43am  \n\nAs well as surviving an era of uncompromising defending, Pel\u00e9 also played an absurd number of matches in a schedule that would make modern sports scientists faint. From the end of the 1950s to the early 1970s Pel\u00e9 was the star attraction of his club side Santos and their globetrotting money-making circus.\n\u201cWe were in demand,\u201d wrote Pel\u00e9 in his autobiography. \u201cThe suits were very keen to cash in.\u201d And cash in they did, but at some points their schedule was absolutely preposterous. For example, between the end of May and beginning of July 1959, they played 22 matches in eight countries around Europe, including encounters with Real Madrid, Barcelona, Hamburg, Feyenoord and Sporting. \u201cIt was ridiculous,\u201d wrote Pel\u00e9. \u201cThere was no time to relax; there was barely enough to travel from stadium to stadium.\u201d\nThat excerpt is taken from Nick Miller\u2019s story on Santos reaching England for the first time in 1962, a piece that contains further references to the ludicrous expectations heaped upon Pel\u00e9\u2019s shoulders.\n\nPel\u00e9 and his colleagues were basically being flogged silly by the Santos hierarchy, particularly when it became clear that he was going to leave when his contract expired in 1974. \u201cThe bird that laid the golden eggs was about to fly the coop,\u201d wrote Pel\u00e9, \u201cand they were really going to make him play, make him bank some money for the club \u2026 In an 18-month period we toured South America, the Caribbean, North America, Europe, Asia and Australia \u2026 Never in my life have I had my time so filled with airports, hotels and different countries. I had already played my 1,000th game for Santos, against Transvaal in Paramaribo, Surinam, and it seemed they were determined to get a few more hundred out of me before I went.\u201d \n\nHugh McIlvanney, writing in the Observer when Santos visited England in 1972, agreed:\n\nNow more than ever the justification for these profit-making excursions by Santos is the name of Pel\u00e9 \u2013 his name rather than his prowess, because he has no chance of displaying that adequately when he is being asked to play three or four games in as many countries in the same week. Pel\u00e9 is now as much an icon and an industry as he is a footballer \u2026 These tours have no more relevance to Pel\u00e9\u2019s reality as a great player than a jaunt round the American lecture circuit has to the work of a serious writer \u2026\nHe smiled and joked with those of us who had met him in Rio, Mexico and elsewhere and even when he spoke of the the impossible pressures of the tour his expression was wry rather than bitter. \u2018Too many planes, too much football,\u2019 he said. \u2018How can we play well?\u2019\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n 12.32am  \n\nInfantino\u2019s comment about Pel\u00e9 being kicked to shreds is not a throwaway remark. He played in an era where attackers were afforded far less protection from referees, as this clip attests.\n\nSimon Burnton has written about Pel\u00e9\u2019s brutal treatment at the 1966 World Cup, a tournament that proved a nadir in the Brazilian\u2019s international career. \n\nTheir best player, Pel\u00e9, was kicked so much in the first game against Bulgaria (\u201cI think every team will take care of him in the same manner,\u201d said their coach) that he could play no part in the second, a 3-1 defeat by Hungary when Brazil had two goals disallowed, and he then spent much of the third as a virtual spectator after Portugal\u2019s Jo\u00e3o Morais fouled him and, when he tried to get up and play on, fouled him again a bit harder. Morais was not cautioned. Brazil\u2019s first game had been refereed by a West German, the other two by Englishmen.\n\u201cWhen I first came back to Brazil after the World Cup games of 1966, my heart wasn\u2019t in playing football,\u201d Pel\u00e9 later said. \u201cThe games had been a revelation to me in their unsportsmanlike conduct and weak refereeing. England won the games that year but in my opinion she did not have the best team in the field.\u201d On another occasion he said that in 1966 \u201cfootball stopped being an art, stopped drawing the crowds by its skills, instead it became an actual war\u201d.\n\n\n\n\n\n 12.23am  \n\nThank you Michael, and I will begin by continuing the tribute from FIFA, who have distributed an official statement attributed to the organisation\u2019s president, Gianni Infantino, under the headline Pel\u00e9: Immortal - forever with us.\n\nFor everyone who loves the beautiful game, this is the day we never wanted to come. The day we lost Pel\u00e9.\n\u201cO Rei\u201d was unique in so many ways.\nHe was the only player to have won the FIFA World Cup three times and his skill and imagination were incomparable. Pel\u00e9 did things that no other player would even dream of, such as the famous dummy in the 1970 FIFA World Cup semi-final that became known as the \u201cPel\u00e9 run-around.\u201d Or the goal he scored in the 1958 FIFA World Cup final as a 17-year-old when he flicked the ball over a defender and volleyed it into the net.\nThe sight of him punching the air in celebration is one of the most iconic in our sport, and is etched into our history. In fact, because televised football was still in his infancy at the time, we only saw small glimpses of what he was capable of.\nMost importantly, \u201cThe King\u201d rose the throne with a smile on his face. Football could be brutal in those days, and Pel\u00e9 was often on the receiving end of some rough treatment. But, while he knew how to stand up for himself, he was always an exemplary sportsman, with genuine respect for his opponents.\nI had the great privilege of meeting him in several occasions. In 2016, already as FIFA President, we were side by side for the premiere of Pel\u00e9\u2019s movie, which reminded me of when I sat next to my father in 1981 when he brought me to watch \u201cEscape to Victory\u201d in which Pel\u00e9 starred alongside Silvester Stallone and other famous actors.\nI was 11 years old and my father told me what a great player Pel\u00e9 was. The fantastic goal he scored in that movie was the only way, at that time, to have a glimpse of his incredible skills.\nThe moments spent with him will forever remain in my memory and in my heart.\nPel\u00e9 had a magnetic presence and, when you were with him, the rest of the world stopped.\nHis life is about more than football. He changed perceptions for the better in Brazil, in South America and across the world.\nHis legacy is impossible to summarise in words.\nTo his family and friends, to CBF, to Brazil and to all football fans who loved him so much, I express my sincere condolences.\nToday, we all mourn the loss of the physical presence of our dear Pel\u00e9, but he achieved immortality a long time ago and therefore he will be with us for eternity.\n\n\n\n\n 12.18am  \n\nTime is getting on here in the UK, so going to hand over to Jonathan Howcroft in Australia, who will continue to bring you the best updates, tributes and reaction to Pel\u00e9\u2019s death. I just want to say what a privilege it\u2019s been to be working tonight. \nDo send any thoughts or memories to Jonathan via email, or by tweeting @JPHowcroft. \n\n\n\n\n 12.02am  \n\nThis is the Guardian\u2019s front page in the UK tomorrow. \n\n\n\n\n 11.56pm  \n\nI preferred Ossie Ardiles\u2019s tribute, but each to their own. \n\n\n\n\n 11.34pm  \n\nOssie Ardiles, World Cup winner with Argentina and co-star in Escape to Victory, has his say:\n\nWhile we\u2019re here \u2026 oh go on then. Michael Caine and Pel\u00e9? Delicious.\n\nIf you haven\u2019t seen Escape to Victory, I implore you to watch it. An irresistable mix of good v evil, football, Bobby Moore and Sylvester Stallone (among others).\n\nFor those that have watched it, you might enjoy this David Squires cartoon.\n\n\nUpdated at 11.39pm GMT\n\n\n 11.13pm  \n\nSometimes, less is more. \n\n\n\n\n 11.12pm  \n\nAmazing to think about how rapidly the world changed over Pel\u00e9\u2019s career. Being a young man in the eye of that storm must have been a seismic undertaking. In 1958, days after winning the World Cup, he had to radio his father to tell him he had won the World Cup. By 1970, his third World Cup triumph was transmitted to the globe by colour TV. \nThis is an email from Darryl Accone, in Johannesburg.\n\nSouth Africa introduced television only in the mid-1970s, so it was as a 10-year-old that I listened to the 1970 World Cup Final with my parents, grandparents, uncles, aunts and cousins at my grandparents\u2019 home. On my grandfather\u2019s splendid old radio/ gramophone player we were tuned in to the BBC\u2019s commentary, and the litany of Brazilian names rings in my ears till today: Pel\u00e9, Rivelino, G\u00e9rson, Jairzinho, Tost\u00e3o, Carlos Alberto (that goal!). As tributes to Pel\u00e9 emphasise, he brought love and togetherness to football, family and people - one of whom remembers as if it were today those few hours when a game in Mexico was played out on the sunny porch of a home in Johannesburg, and Pel\u00e9 won imperishable fame, adulation and respect.\nTo the King, from South Africa with love.\n\n\n\n\n 11.08pm  \n\nThe gallery also features a striking image of Pel\u00e9 with his father, Dondinho, around the family dinner table. Pel\u00e9 was just nine years old when Brazil lost the 1950 World Cup Final to Uruguay. \n\u201cIt was the first time I ever saw my father cry, and all because of that defeat,\u201d he told Fifa in 2014. \u201cI remember saying to him: \u2018Don\u2019t cry, Papa. I\u2019ll win the World Cup for you.\u2019\u201d\nEight years later, as a 17-year-old, he achieved that dream. Even the Swedish players were in awe. \u201cAfter the fifth goal I didn\u2019t want to mark Pel\u00e9 any more. I wanted to applaud him,\u201d said midfielder Sigge Parling.\n\u201cMy first thoughts were about my family,\u201d Pel\u00e9 wrote in his autobiography. \u201cDid they know that we were champions? I wanted to speak to my parents but there were no telephones, so I kept on saying, \u2018I\u2019ve got to tell my dad, I\u2019ve got to tell my dad.\u2019\n\u201cI only managed to speak to him in the following days, using an international radio. I can remember saying things like: \u2018Did you see me with the Swedish king? Over,\u2019 and \u201cI shook the king\u2019s hand. Over.\u2019 \u201d\nWhen the pair were reunited, Pele recalled: \u201cI saw my father cry again... this time with happiness.\u201d\n\n\n\n 10.55pm  \n\nI am biased, of course, but I do believe this is the greatest gallery of Pel\u00e9 on the internet. Has a bit of everything: World Cup glory, quiet family moments, being stuck in a traffic jam in Bolton, and even a portrait from our own photographer, Tom Jenkins. Enjoy.\n\n\nUpdated at 11.01pm GMT\n\n\n 10.53pm  \n\nRegarding that Bobby Moore quote, I\u2019ve received this email from George Evanko. Turns out Pel\u00e9 did actually play in goal, as well. \n\nI believe I have a somewhat unique memory of Pel\u00e9. In 1973, his Santos club played a friendly in my hometown of Baltimore against a local pro team, the Bays. As you might expect, it was a hopeless mismatch, which Santos won, 4-0. I remember thinking that Pel\u00e9 wasn\u2019t doing anything special and, in the end, he had scored two goals, one on a corner kick. He made it look effortless. \nI have to be one of the few people who can say I saw him play goalie! He did so for the final few minutes, when their keeper went down with an injury. \nFor confirmation of this, I found an Associated Press story from that date:\nClaudia, the substitute goal keeper for Santos, was injured with nine minutes, 36 seconds remaining. The regular goalie, Cejas, went back to Brazil after being injured in a game against the Bays last Friday, so Pel\u00e9 took over the duties for the remainder of the game.\n\n\n\n\n 10.49pm  \n\nI\u2019ve nicked some (old) quotes from this excellent Antique Football thread on Twitter.\n\u201cPel\u00e9 is one of the few who contradicted my theory. Instead of 15 minutes of fame, he will have 15 centuries.\u201d \u2013 Andy Warhol.\n\u201cI told myself before the game, \u2018He\u2019s made of skin and bones just like everyone else\u2019. But I was wrong.\u201d \u2013 Tarcisio Burgnich, the Italy defender who marked Pel\u00e9 in the 1970 World Cup Final.\n\n\u201cAbsolutely everybody wanted to shake his hand, to get a photo with him. Saying you had partied with Pel\u00e9 was the biggest badge of honour going.\u201d - Mick Jagger.\n\u201cPel\u00e9 was the most complete player I\u2019ve ever seen, he had everything ... I remember Saldanha the coach being asked by a Brazilian journalist who was the best goalkeeper in his squad. He said Pel\u00e9. The man could play in any position.\u201d- Bobby Moore.\nI\u2019ll end with this from Shep Messing, who was a goalkeeper with the New York Cosmos. If there is not a meeting tomorrow at Vogue about commissioning a long read into Pel\u00e9\u2019s threads in the 1970s (specifically lapels) then I am putting my hand up to write it.\n\n\nUpdated at 11.09pm GMT\n\n\n 10.28pm  \n\nNo liveblog from the Guardian would be complete without an update or two from Manchester. Here\u2019s Sir Bobby Charlton with a few words: \n\u201cPel\u00e9 was a truly magical footballer and a wonderful human being. It was an honour to have shared a pitch with him and I send my sincerest condolences to his family, friends and the Brazilian people.\u201d\nCharlton\u2019s former Manchester United teammate Denis Law added: \u201cThis is very sad news indeed. Pel\u00e9 was an \u00adunbelievable footballer; he had style, grace, flair and made everything look so easy. The precision in the way he played made him such a joy to watch. However, more than anything, he was a good man with a great \u00adpresence and a fantastic smile.\u201d\n\n\n\n 10.14pm  \n\nGreat detail from Alex Bellos, who wrote one of Pel\u00e9 autobiographies. We\u2019ll have a nice piece from Alex on Friday about Pel\u00e9\u2019s complicated relationship with Brazil, on and off the field.\n\n\n\nUpdated at 10.16pm GMT\n\n\n 10.11pm  \n\nSaturday/Sunday: NYE party.\nSunday: Lula\u2019s inauguration.\nMonday: Pel\u00e9\u2019s wake.\nGood luck to anyone out there in Brazil doing the early work shift on Tuesday.\n\n\nUpdated at 10.17pm GMT\n\n\n 9.58pm  \n\nMore reaction from around the grounds \u2026\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 9.45pm  \n\nFrom that moment, a friendship between Pel\u00e9 and Banks was born. The Brazilian led the tributes to the Englishman when he died in 2019:\n\nI scored many goals in my life but people always like to ask about the one I didn\u2019t score, because of that save. While it was indeed phenomenal my memory of Gordon is not defined by that but his friendship. He was a kind, warm man who gave so much to people. I am glad he saved my header because it was the start of a friendship I will always treasure. Whenever we met it was like we had never been apart.\u201d\n\n\nUpdated at 10.17pm GMT\n\n\n 9.42pm  \n\nPel\u00e9 was known for his preposterous goal record but two of the biggest moments that come to mind were two near misses at the 1970 World Cup. Or rather, one miss and one save (from England\u2019s Gordon Banks). Two pieces of absolute genius, whichever way you look at them.\nThis dummy against Uruguay in the semi-final.\n\nAnd this, against England, in the group stage. Pel\u00e9 actually shouted \u201cgoal!\u201d before realising that Banks had actually saved his header.\n\n\nUpdated at 9.50pm GMT\n\n\n 9.28pm  \n\nMore tributes are coming in from both former teammates and opponents.\nFranz Beckenbauer, Germany legend and now Bayern Munich\u2019s honorary president, wrote: \u201cToday, football lost the greatest man in its history \u2013 and I lost a unique friend. Born in Tr\u00eas Cora\u00e7\u00f5es, Pel\u00e9 had three hearts: for football, for his family and for all people. Someone who played with the stars and always stayed down to earth.\n\u201cI went to the US in 1977 because I really wanted to play on a team with Pel\u00e9 at New York Cosmos. This time at his side was one of the greatest experiences of my career. We became champions together right away, and Pel\u00e9 then just called me his brother. It was an unimaginable honour for me. Football will always belong to you! You will always be here. Thank you for your game, O Rei!\u201d\nSir Geoff Hurst, who won the World Cup in 1966 with England and also played in the 1-0 defeat to Brazil at the 1970 World Cup, had this to say:\n\n\nUpdated at 9.33pm GMT\n\n\n 9.22pm  \n\nSantos, the club Pel\u00e9 played at for almost the entirety of his club career, have posted this.\n\nSantos were a relatively small club when Pel\u00e9 came through the team. In the late 1950s, with the world\u2019s biggest star in their ranks, Santos realised they had a method of printing money by sending the squad out on the road. And, for the next decade, they sent them to every corner of the globe.\n\n\n\nUpdated at 12.49am GMT\n\n\n 9.15pm  \n\nThis is the current scene outside the Albert Einstein hospital in S\u00e3o Paulo, as police, fans and news teams scramble for positions. \n\n\n\n\n 9.12pm  \nKey event\n\nFor Brazil, this is a death of a historic figure on a scale similar to that of Queen Elizabeth II in Britain. All the major news channels and web portals immediately switched to wall-to-wall \u2013 often white-on-black-headlined - coverage of his death and legacy.\n\u201cAdeus, Pel\u00e9! Brazil bids farewell to the greatest footballer in history\u201d noted a sombre yet celebratory lead story on the UOL site, which described him as not just a footballer but the most important icon in the country\u2019s history.\n\u201cThe death of Pel\u00e9: the King of Football\u201d ran the headline of Brazil\u2019s most popular news site, Globo, which foregrounded a gallery showing the football-loving child in a poor backwater rising to win three World Cups and standing shoulder to shoulder with Queen Elizabeth and Nelson Mandela.\nOutgoing president Jair Bolsonaro was initially silent amid rumours about whether he will leave the country before the transfer of power on 1 January. Others quoted Neymar\u2019s post: \u201cPel\u00e9 changed everything. He transformed football into an art.\u201d\nAs usual, the legendary football writer Juca Kfouri put it best in a touching personal reminiscence for Folha: \u201cPel\u00e9 kicked magnificently with both feet, headed with his eyes open, scored goals like no one else, made passes that surprised even his teammates, killed the ball on his chest as if he were cradling it like a baby in his arms.\u201d\n\nUpdated at 9.27pm GMT\n\n\n 9.04pm  \n\nOf course, football is a global game \u2013 the most global game \u2013 and Pel\u00e9 didn\u2019t need to be playing in front of you to be your hero. Here\u2019s another excellent email from Zaven Aharonian, who grew up in Yerevan, Armenia in the 1960s, when it was part of the Soviet Union.\n\nI\u2019m 64 now. I have been living this game since I was five. We did not see them, until 1970, but all the boys kicking the ball on asphalt or on dusty turf of our growing city wanted to be like those guys whose pictures we saw on the walls of a small booth of the shoemaker down the street, a lucky guy who somehow got them from foreign visitors \u2013 Pel\u00e9, Garrincha, Didi, Vava\u2026.\nPel\u00e9 was the best, the brightest, who made the football and entertainment a show. Every kid wanted to be like him. Learning the tricks, the dribbles the shots from scarce tv clips. Brazil friendly with USSR in Moscow in 1965 was No 1 event of the summer \u2026 and finally 1970, in colour, it was a revelation to see that Brazil team, arguably the best in World Cup history, with Pel\u00e9 as a Crown Jewel part of unforgettable magnificent five \u2013 Pel\u00e9, Tost\u00e3o, Jairzinho, G\u00e9rson, Rivellino.\nHe taught me how to play intelligent football \u2013 as Cruyff formulated later, \u201cyou play it with your head and help with your feet\u201d. Pel\u00e9 was the first who did it. His intelligence, with his physical and technical prowess, made him the first and the only King of football.\nHe is eternity now.He was the first and best.Thank you for your game you made an art.\u201d\n\n\nUpdated at 9.08pm GMT\n\n\n 8.55pm  \n\nFittingly, this is an email I have just received from Ken Brucker in San Diego.\n\nPel\u00e9 was a member of the first visiting soccer team I ever went to see play in a professional match. He and Franz Beckenbauer are the only members of the New York Cosmos whose names I remember right off hand. At six or seven years of age, I really didn\u2019t have any idea about how special this match was. Some kids growing up wanted to be like Mike (Michael Jordan). When I tried playing soccer, I wanted to be Pel\u00e9.\u201d\nHa! Imagine going to your first game, and it\u2019s Pel\u00e9 and Beckenbauer strutting their stuff. Reminds me of the first season I supported Blackburn Rovers, and we won the Premier League. It can only be downhill from there.\n\n\nUpdated at 9.09pm GMT\n\n\n 8.51pm  \n\nBarack Obama is the latest to pay tribute.\n\nPel\u00e9\u2019s legacy on football (or soccer, of course) in the US should not be underestimated. He signed for the New York Cosmos in the twilight of his career and transformed the league there. Here is some nice detail from the Guardian\u2019s obituary.\n\nHe played his last game for the club in October 1974 but, with financial clouds still hanging over him, he came out of retirement a few months later after receiving an offer he simply could not refuse. To the astonishment of football fans, particularly in Brazil, he went to play for New York Cosmos in the fledgling North American Soccer League (NASL). They would pay him $7m for three years as a player, plus another three as a \u201cgoodwill ambassador\u201d.\nAs well as a salary that would make him the highest-paid sportsman in the world, he was also tempted by the offer of a new challenge laid down by the Cosmos manager, Clive Toye, perhaps one that suited a footballer past his peak: \u201cI told him don\u2019t go to Italy, don\u2019t go to Spain, all you can do is win a championship. Come to the US and you can win a country.\u201d\nAnd so it proved: Pel\u00e9 and the Cosmos were a perfect fit. The astonishing skill that had beguiled football fans in almost every country in the world was a revelation to a new American audience, and he loved the razzmatazz of the NASL \u2013 his easy charm was a gift to sports marketing men who were selling, in effect, a brand new product.\nOver three seasons he scored 65 goals in 111 games for the Cosmos, and led them to the 1977 American championship. The team became a huge commercial presence and regularly sold out their 60,000-seater stadium \u2013 unthinkable before his arrival. His last game came in October 1977, an exhibition match in New York between his two clubs, Santos and Cosmos, broadcast to dozens of countries, in which he played one half for each side, and scored his last goal, his 1,283rd in 1,367 games. Those figures are remarkable in themselves, but the fact that more than 500 of those games were friendlies played all over the world is testament to his popularity and box office appeal.\n\n\nUpdated at 8.57pm GMT\n\n\n 8.40pm  \nFrom Tom Phillips, our Latin America correspondent\n\nPel\u00e9\u2019s death has sparked a huge outpouring of emotion in his native Brazil, with politicians, celebrities and sporting icons uniting to celebrate Brazil\u2019s departed king.\nThe Brazilian government led the tributes tweeting: \u201cFootball perfection; the King was almost synonymous with his homeland. Generations to come will remember him as a gentleman off the field, and a magician on it\u201d.\nBrazil\u2019s incoming president, Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, said he believed Pel\u00e9 would join a heavenly kickabout with football greats such as Garrincha, Socrates and Maradona.\n\u201cFew Brazilians carried our country\u2019s name so far,\u201d Lula tweeted. \u201cHowever different their language was to Portuguese, foreigners from all over the planet always found a way of pronouncing the magic word: \u2018Pel\u00e9\u2019\u201d\n\u201cThank you Pel\u00e9 for all the happiness you gave us!\u201d tweeted the samba star Zeca Pagodinho.\nPel\u00e9\u2019s former club Santos tweeted an image of a crown alongside a single word: \u201cEternal\u201d.\nThe mayor of Rio, Eduardo Paes, described Pel\u00e9 as an everlasting football icon and a unique ambassador for Brazil on the world stage. \u201cThe genius and talent of the planet\u2019s most popular King of Sport will enchant and inspire generations to come,\u201d Paes wrote.\n\u201cThank you, Pel\u00e9! Thank you for the smiles you gave us. For the tears of emotion. For the cheers of goal Thank you for the happiness you gave the Brazilian people and the people of the world. Never was there such a beloved king,\u201d wrote the former president Dilma Rousseff.\nBrazil\u2019s new culture minister, the singer Margareth Menezes, said her country had lost \u201cthe greatest player in history\u201d.\nBrazil\u2019s most famous football commentator Galv\u00e3o Bueno tweeted: \u201cMy friend \u00c9dson has gone!! ... But not Pel\u00e9!! Pel\u00e9 is eternal!!\u201d\n\nUpdated at 8.43pm GMT\n\n\n 8.37pm  \n\nSpeaking of tributes, here are two significant messages. Lionel Messi leads with a very simple message \u2013 \u201cRest in peace\u201d \u2013 while Cristiano Ronaldo has posted:\n\nMy deepest condolences to all of Brazil, and in particular to the family of Mr. Edson Arantes do Nascimento. A mere \u201cgoodbye\u201d to the eternal King Pel\u00e9 will never be enough to express the pain that currently embraces the entire world of football. An inspiration for so many millions, a reference from yesterday, today, forever.\nThe affection he always showed for me was reciprocal in every moment we shared, even from a distance. He will never be forgotten and his memory will live on forever in each of us football lovers. Rest in peace, King Pel\u00e9.\u201d\n\n\n\nUpdated at 8.37pm GMT\n\n\n 8.28pm  \n\nThis made me smile. When Maradona died in 2020, Pel\u00e9 was one of the first to pay tribute: \u201cOne day, I hope we can play football together in the sky\u201d. \n\n\nUpdated at 8.30pm GMT\n\n\n 8.26pm  \n\nA few emails are trickling through from readers.\n\u201cI was fortunate to see the 1958 World Cup final, live on television, and it is still to this day the most extraordinary game I have ever seen, and Pel\u00e9 was at the heart of it,\u201d Peter Rist writes. \u201cI couldn\u2019t believe the things that were done by the Brazilian players, especially Pel\u00e9 \u2013 how he was able to control the ball with his feet, legs, shoulders and head. And, having won three World Cups, He is surely the real GOAT \u2013 and a wonderful human being, to boot.\u201d\nIt\u2019s worth remembering that HE WAS JUST 17 when he won football\u2019s greatest prize for the first time. Imagine that: 17. He scored twice in the final against Sweden, a remarkable 5-2 victory. Here is the Guardian\u2019s report from 1958, courtesy of WR Taylor.\n\n\nUpdated at 8.33pm GMT\n\n\n 8.17pm  \n\nThe GOAT (greatest of all time) debate is a tiresome, futile exercise, but it has reignited over recent years with the exploits of Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo. Different players in different eras can never truly be compared: the standard of opponents, training, pitches and even equipment (balls, boots) have completely transformed the sport. Pel\u00e9, Maradona and Messi should be seen only in the context of their own time.\nPel\u00e9\u2019s legacy looms large over all who have followed him. Maradona, Cruyff, Iniesta, Zidane, Messi, CR7 have all borrowed something from his wheelhouse. The video below is evidence of that. Everyone should bow down to The King.\n\n\nUpdated at 8.19pm GMT\n\n\n 8.05pm  \nThe Guardian's obituary\n\n\n(features a sensational photo of him at the 1981 Cannes Film Festival!)\n\n\n\n 8.02pm  \n\nIt is worth remembering that Neymar equalled Pel\u00e9\u2019s scoring record for Brazil at the World Cup. Both players have 77 goals for their country.\n\nUpdated at 8.03pm GMT\n\n\n 7.58pm  \n\nNeymar, the player who now wears the Brazil No 10 shirt made famous by Pel\u00e9, posted on Instagram:\n\nBefore Pel\u00e9, \u201c10\u201d was just a number. I\u2019ve read this phrase somewhere, at some point in my life. But this sentence, beautiful, is incomplete. I would say before Pel\u00e9 football was just a sport. Pel\u00e9 has changed it all. He turned football into art, into entertainment He gave voice to the poor, to the blacks and especially: He gave visibility to Brazil. Soccer and Brazil have raised their status thanks to the King! He\u2019s gone but his magic remains. Pel\u00e9 is FOREVER!!\n\n\n\nUpdated at 8.01pm GMT\n\n\n 7.53pm  \n\nThe emergence of the teenaged Pel\u00e9 during the 1958 World Cup opened a door to a new dimension of football. The brief televised highlights of the matches in Sweden were broadcast in a black and white that was actually more like blurred shades of grey but already the Brazilian prodigy seemed to be sharply focused and bathed in a golden glow.\nThe skinny 17-year-old with the flat-top haircut scored six goals, several of them executed with an impudent wit and a hitherto unimaginable level of technique, and then wept openly on the shoulder of Gilmar, the team\u2019s goalkeeper, when the triumph was secured. For many of his new fans in foreign lands, Edson Arantes do Nascimento was the first complicated foreign name they committed to memory.\nTwelve years after that first eruption of genius he won his third World Cup winner\u2019s medal. The 1970 tournament was watched by many viewers on colour television sets, a high proportion of them purchased specially for the occasion. Football has never seemed as splendid as when Pel\u00e9 \u2013 now a mature man of 29 \u2013 was at the heart of a team including Tost\u00e3o, Jairzinho, G\u00e9rson, Roberto Rivellino and Carlos Alberto, an ensemble of masters surrounded by their own golden aura as they took the game to a new level of creative interplay, with the No 10 as their conductor.\nRead the full tribute here:\n\n\nUpdated at 7.53pm GMT\n\n\n 7.46pm  \n\n\n\n\n\n 7.45pm  \n\nFrance\u2019s Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 called Pel\u00e9 the \u201cking of football\u201d in a social media post.\n\n\nUpdated at 7.52pm GMT\n\n\n 7.45pm  \n\nAnother England footballer, Sir Geoff Hurst, said he was \u201cproud\u201d to have shared a pitch with him.\n\n\n\n\n 7.39pm  \n\nFormer England footballer Gary Lineker has posted on Twitter paying tribute to the \u201cdivine\u201d Pel\u00e9.\n\n\nUpdated at 7.51pm GMT\n\n\n 7.35pm  \n\nA hospital statement read: \u201cThe Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein regretfully confirms the death of Edson Arantes do Nascimento, Pele, today, December 29, 2022, at 3:27 pm, due to the failure of multiple organs, a result of the progression of cancer of colon associated with his previous clinical condition.\n\u201cHospital Israelita Albert Einstein sympathizes with the family and everyone who suffers from the loss of our dear King of Football.\u201d\n\n\n\n 7.35pm  \n\nA statement on Pele\u2019s official Instagram account said: \u201cInspiration and love marked the journey of King Pele, who peacefully passed away today.\n\u201cOn his journey, Edson enchanted the world with his genius in sport, stopped a war, carried out social works all over the world and spread what he most believed to be the cure for all our problems: love.\n\u201cHis message today becomes a legacy for future generations. Love, love and love, forever.\u201d\n\n\nUpdated at 7.38pm GMT\n\n\n 7.22pm  \nPel\u00e9 has died\n\nOne of the greatest footballers to ever play the game \u2013 perhaps the greatest \u2013 has died.\nHere is our news report:\n\nAnd here is Richard Williams\u2019s long read on the great man. \n\n\nUpdated at 7.23pm GMT\n"

                    "body": "  9.35pm    So that is all from us this evening, thank you for joining us for yet another astonishing England win. Four goals from Mead, a hat-trick from Toone and goals from White and Stanway continues England\u2019s fantastic run in the World Cup qualifiers. If you want to re-live any of the action or have a recap, read Suzy Wrack\u2019s report here.     9.33pm    Thank you for all your contributions this evening, it was great to know it\u2019s not just me who has a clumsy five minutes! My carpet is almost dry (four hours later!) and there appears to be no stain. I credit my blotting skills. Were they as impressive as England\u2019s 10-0 win? Maybe, just maybe.     9.30pm    England manager Sarina Wiegman has confirmed in her post-match press conference that Beth England and Niamh Charles have tested negative. They will both be in contention for Tuesday\u2019s qualifier. It\u2019s thought captain Leah Williamson will also be fit for the fixture. No update so far on Alex Greenwood and Lotte Wubben-Moy who picked up injury worries ahead of this match.     9.25pm    So are England contenders for the Euros title? They definitely are but they\u2019ll have fierce competition, namely in the Netherlands, Spain and Sweden. Of course Sarina Wiegman\u2019s team have the home advantage but it will be a difficult task for them and all countries involved to get their hands on the trophy.     9.20pm    What a night for Ellen White, surpassing Harry Kane and Bobby Charlton in the all-time England scorers. She is in touching distance of eclipsing Wayne Rooney\u2019s record of 53 goals. Will she break it on Tuesday against Northern Ireland? If she doesn\u2019t she will have ample opportunity this summer with three friendlies and then the Euros. Rooney is now the only other player to reach 50 goals for England. Such an amazing achievement for the Manchester City star.      9.15pm    England manager Sarina Wiegman told ITV: \u201cAn opponent that compared to us isn\u2019t great but we have make the game. We have to speed up the game. That\u2019s what we tried to do. We scored 10 goals which is nice. \u201cIt\u2019s hard. We created lots of chances and sometimes we should have been more patient.\u201d     9.10pm    This isn\u2019t the end of England\u2019s international spell as they will play Northern Ireland on Tuesday. There could be more squad rotation in that match too with the likes of Beth England and Niamh Charles potentially being available. Will they go for consistency or experimentation? With a more difficult side on Tuesday you\u2019d think Wiegman would put out her strongest side.     9.06pm    Ellen White told ITV after scoring 50 England goals: \u201cI think it\u2019s pleasing to score. The overall performance, the standard is remaining really high. We wanted those three points. \u201cIt\u2019s a massive privilege [to be among Harry Kane and Wayne Rooney]. It\u2019s a dream for me to play for England. For me it\u2019s any way I can contribute to the team... It\u2019s an incredible feeling to be among those amazing players.\u201d     9.02pm    A player who was impressive when she came on was Nikita Parris. She was causing all sorts of trouble for the defence and she secured a lot of free kicks. The only thing she was missing was a goal which she would have had if she wasn\u2019t offside. It will be interesting to see if she gets a starting shirt for their qualifier against Northern Ireland on Tuesday.     8.56pm   Full-time: North Macedonia 0-10 England  England continue their flawless run in these World Cup qualifiers as they keep another clean sheet. Beth Mead got four, Ella Toone scored a hat-trick with Ellen White and Georgia Stanway also among the scorers. It was a dominant performance with almost 40 shots at goal but there were scores which should have been converted by the visitors. But a win is a win and another three points sees them stay top of Group D.  Updated at 8.58pm BST    8.53pm    90 + 3 min: England build from deep on their pursuit of number 11 and it makes its way to Panchurova, who smothers the ball. Carter sends the ball to Toone and it pings around the box. Zelem gets a shot away but it sails over the bar.  It may be staying 10-0 here, with goals definitely left out on the pitch by England.     8.50pm    90 + 1 min: Markovska is now booked, the fifth yellow for the hosts this evening! There will be five minutes added and so England could find another here, they definitely have the time.      8.49pm    89 min: Velkova is back to her feet after a lengthy break and will stay on the pitch. And while it may be late in this match England continue to fish for another goal.     8.47pm    87 min: Russo almost scores again but the keeper makes a great save after a defensive blunder saw England pounce. The Lionesses remain relentless and keep hammering North Macedonia\u2019s door. The latest chance ends in a goal kick. Velkova is now down with injury. I can imagine there will be a good few added minutes.     8.44pm    84 min: Parris is chopped down on the edge of the box with Velkova getting a yellow card. The Arsenal player has been clinical since coming on. Carter takes the kick but can\u2019t find anyone in the box. England still in possession and building once again. Parris looked as though she had scored but she was offside!     8.42pm    82 min: Russo almost gets among the scoring action but Panchurova collects well. There\u2019s a break in play as Boseska is on the ground after helping to defend that Russo shot.     8.40pm    80 min: I predicted 10-0 before kick-off but I think there are a few more to come. The Lionesses record away win is 13-0 and I could see them at least equalling it here as North Macedonia tire. England have another free kick and they are building from halfway. North Macedonia make a change as Petrushevska comes on for Nikolovska.     8.38pm   GOAL! North Macedonia 0-10 England (Toone, 77')  Now Toone gets among the hat-trick action. It was too easy as Parris makes an open run into the box and it\u2019s passed back to Toone who slices it.   Updated at 8.46pm BST    8.36pm    76 min: Salihi has been given a yellow card for a foul on Mead and England immediately launch an attack. It\u2019s hard to find new words to describe the Lionesses brutal forward play.  Parris has earned them a free kick just outside the box but it\u2019s well blocked by North Macedonia. Huge 62 goals across seven games in these qualifiers. A staggering statistic.     8.34pm   GOAL! North Macedonia 0-9 England (Toone, 73')  The ball pin balls around the box with Russo doing so well to keep it in play. Toone finds her second as she is unmarked in the box. Just as a say there\u2019s a lull, there\u2019s a goal!     8.33pm    73 min: Mead and Stokes link up in the box but the hosts manage to close down the attack. Parris gets a cross in the hope of finding Scott but her long legs go a bit high and possession is given away. There\u2019s definitely been a lull in this game in the last ten minutes but England will be encouraged as they still haven\u2019t conceded in the World Cup qualifiers.     8.30pm    70 min: North Macedonia have a free kick and they force Hampton into a catch. The most the keeper has been threatened this evening. England make a triple change as Russo, Zelem and Daly coming on for Walsh, Bronze and White. White will have to wait to equal Rooney\u2019s record but she has reached 50 goals for her country this evening. Just to give an update on my carpet stain, for those interested haha, it seems to be clearing up. Thank goodness! My clumsy moment hasn\u2019t led to permanent damage.     8.27pm    67 min: An England corner sees Mead take up the set-piece duties. Bronze got a touch to it and she just can\u2019t get the header on target. If the visitors capitalised on all their chances the scoreline would be even more punishing for North Macedonia.     8.25pm    65 min: Bronze\u2019s cross has too much on it and England\u2019s attack stalls. But once more they are easily back in possession in seconds. Parris tries to get a cross in but it\u2019s well blocked. Mead does get a cross in with her getting a slick pass across goal with it just evading White.     8.23pm    63 min: You won\u2019t be surprised as I tell you the Lionesses are continuing their onslaught of attack. North Macedonia must be so tired at this point, England have had 28 shots at goal. And there\u2019s no sign of them stopping any time soon with Parris attempting to score but it goes just wide.     8.20pm    60 min: England make their first changes as Parris and Scott come on for Hemp and Stanway. Hemp has been great with multiple assists and Stanway has slotted two goals.  Updated at 8.21pm BST    8.18pm    58 min: This is a mirror of the start of the game, the first three goals were scored early doors and then England let up slightly. Can the Lionesses keep up this pressure? England again on the attack but White clashes with Panchurova and North Macedonia get the free kick.     8.16pm   GOAL! North Macedonia 0-8 England (Stanway, 55')  Okay I am struggling to keep up! Another great cross from Hemp sees Stanway put her second of the match away. She turned and smashes home, wow!   Updated at 8.32pm BST    8.15pm    55 min: North Macedonia are making changes with Rochi and Petrovska make way for Salihi and Stojkovska. England running up to goal once again in search of their eighth.     8.13pm   GOAL! North Macedonia 0-7 England (Mead, 52')  Oh that slice was perfect as Hemp\u2019s attempt is saved and Mead pounces for her fourth. One more goal would equal an England record for the most goals in a single game.   Updated at 8.23pm BST    8.12pm    52 min: Wow, so so close! Bronze gets a shot away and White flies through the air to try and get a head to it but she just misses. I have received a few messages about these matches being a waste of time due to the scoreline. A lot of people are discussing whether the World Cup qualifiers need to be adapted to avoid these huge scores but for now it\u2019s the route to the world stage.     8.10pm    50 min: Panchurova is down injured, she looks in pain and is crying on the floor. Let\u2019s hope that\u2019s not as bad as it looks. She\u2019s receiving treatment and looks to be staying on the pitch.     8.08pm    48 min: Stanway tries to get a long-range shot away but it\u2019s deflected for a corner. Hemp takes the kick, a set-piece taker change with Stanway taking them in the first half, with White getting a head to it. It\u2019s cleared on the line but a foul goes against England.     8.07pm   GOAL! North Macedonia 0-6 England (Mead, 46')  And there\u2019s the hat-trick for Mead! A great hit into the corner sees the first goal of the second half. No changes for England at half-time but the hosts have with Mustafa off for Shemsovikj.   Updated at 8.19pm BST    8.05pm    And we\u2019re back underway!  It\u2019s worth noting there are 124 places between these teams in the world rankings. In terms of the fan question I was asked earlier, my colleagues are unsure as to why there aren\u2019t many supporters in the stadium. So I am presuming it isn\u2019t Covid related. But I may be wrong. If I hear anything concrete I\u2019ll let you know.     7.52pm    Did you know The Guardian has a women\u2019s football newsletter called Moving the Goalposts? If you haven\u2019t seen it yet, check it out and sign up! Great contributors like Suzy Wrack, J\u00falia Belas and Sophie Downey bring you all the major stories happening in the sport and sum up the big talking points.  Click here to sign up so it drops right into your inbox!       7.50pm   Half-time: North Macedonia 0-5 England  Well, what a half that was! North Macedonia haven\u2019t been able to stop the relentless England attack. Mead has had two goals with Toone, White and Stanway getting amongst the action. How many more goals will we see? Huge 45 coming up.     7.49pm    45 + 3 min: It was three added minutes and so half-time is looming. North Macedonia have a free kick but Toone collects the ball well. Rochi is getting frustrated and she has started to have words with the ref. She needs to be careful as she is on a yellow.     7.47pm    45 +1 min: I have missed how many minutes have been added but play continues. England, you guessed it, are still attacking. The peddle is not letting up with Hemp\u2019s chance the latest.     7.45pm   GOAL! North Macedonia 0-5 England (Stanway, 44')  The power on that finish! Toone, Hemp and Stanway get touches on that with the Manchester City star smashing it home. Nothing the keeper could do.   Updated at 8.00pm BST    7.44pm    43 min: That goal takes White beyond Sir Bobby Charlton and Harry Kane in England\u2019s all-time scorers. She needs just three more to equal Wayne Rooney\u2019s record. North Macedonia have a free kick in a great position with Rochi the taker. But England manage to defend well and in the spell Rochi is given a yellow card. So frustrating for the playmaker who tries to make an impact before half-time.     7.42pm   GOAL! North Macedonia 0-4 England (White, 41')  A 50th England goal for White! She finally gets the luck and gets the final touch after Stanway launches the ball in from a corner.   Updated at 7.51pm BST    7.40pm    40 min: It\u2019s more of the same with England keeping their tempo up. Mead floats a ball in with Hemp running in but she concedes a foul in her attempt. The Lionesses aren\u2019t without the ball for long and this time England get the free kick. Three players loom over the ball for England and Stanway plays it short. It pings around the box with Maksuti doing well to defend. It remains in England\u2019s possession as they hunt for their fourth.     7.36pm    36 min: Panchurova makes a great save with the Mead chance and so concedes a corner. Stanway sends it in again but the hosts manage to clear well. Hemp makes another good run and she trips after a foul. The ref keeps the game going until Hemp loses the ball for a free kick. Stanway takes the set-piece and it\u2019s another fantastic save from the hosts keeper.     7.33pm    33 min: Maksuti is on the ground with an injury and it sees a big break in play. It seems she had a clash with Bronze in the air. I believe she is staying on the pitch and props to her as that looked painful. England now on attack once again and Mead almost gets a hat-trick with her shot just sailing over the bar.     7.30pm    30 min: A free kick for England almost sees a fourth goal with White heading across goal but Carter and Bright don\u2019t get to it. They are on the attack again and it feels that will be the tale all evening. Daniel has been in touch on Twitter asking if I was able to save my juice drink. Sadly all but one mouthful was spilled on the carpet, it\u2019s still drying and I spilled it almost two hours ago. I fear the carpet may be ruined.     7.27pm    27 min: Oh Ellen White, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s her night tonight! This time she slips on a chance she would have been through. She is getting in all the right places but she just needs the last touch to come off. Don\u2019t worry I haven\u2019t forgotten about the fans question, I\u2019ve asked a few colleagues. I do know the capacity at the stadium is 33,000 but as soon as I get an answer on the supporters I\u2019ll update.     7.24pm   GOAL! North Macedonia 0-3 England (Toone, 24')  What a finish by Toone! She was outside the box and running but got her shot away. England running away with it already.   Updated at 7.35pm BST    7.23pm    23 min: England continue to hammer North Macedonia\u2019s defence Ron has been in touch and asked a very valid question: \u201cWhy aren\u2019t there any fans in the North Macedonian Stadium tonight?\u201d I have to be honest, I\u2019m not too sure. I shall put feelers out and get back to you ASAP.     7.21pm    21 min: The confidence of this England side is optimised by keeper Hampton as she is so far out of her goal but she chips the ball over North Macedonian players heads! England get back into the box with Hemp pulling the trigger but her shot goes wide. The visitors could be a lot further ahead if they managed to convert these masses of chances. Again Stanway gets the ball at her feet but she skies the chance.     7.19pm    19 min: White is edging closer to her goal as once again her header comes inches away. It rattles the woodwork and her frustration is starting to show. Petrovska makes a good break and sends the hosts\u2019 first cross into the box. But no teammates were there to help her convert the chance. In terms of clumsy moments so far we\u2019ve had spilt drinks, stained shirts and a ran over laptop. Want to add yours to the list? Let me know via Twitter or email!     7.16pm    16 min: England are their own worst enemy at times with Stanway in a position to shoot just outside of the box but she doesn\u2019t take the opportunity. It came out to Toone who\u2019s pass is loose to go out for a goal kick. Mead, who\u2019s having a cracking game, slides the ball through to Toone who seems to slip to see the shot go wide. More goals are coming but little errors are halting the visitors at the moment.     7.14pm    14 min: Mead is chasing a hat-trick already with less than a quarter of this match gone! England are pressing again, not letting up despite their dominance. Hemp is causing more problems, earning a free kick which is taken quickly. But North Macedonia do well to get the ball back around the box to clear. Sadly their hard work is given away as England easily recover possession. This evening is going to be a hard graft for the hosts.     7.12pm   GOAL! North Macedonia 0-2 England (Mead, 12')  Wow that was so close! Stanway crosses it to White who\u2019s chance goes just wide. North Macedonia thread some passes in the midfield but England manage to close down the play to launch another attack. Mead looks to cross to White but the pass goes straight into goal!     7.10pm    10 min: North Macedonia\u2019s first spell of possession ends in England wrestling the ball back and passing it back to Hampton. Will the Aston villa keeper be troubled at all this evening? England run it up the pitch through Stokes. Mead and Stanway get a touch in the box but the chances go awry. Hemp again crosses in but it just escapes White once more. The keeper concedes another corner with Stanway the taker. Nikolovska does well to clear, the North Macedonia player is having a good game so far.     7.07pm    7 min: That didn\u2019t take long did it? The hosts are immediately under pressure once again following that opening goal. The ball finds itself in the box again with Bronze having a chance but she passes, wasting the opportunity. There\u2019s another corner here. Stanway is the taker once again and North Macedonia clear.     7.05pm   GOAL! North Macedonia 0-1 England (Mead, 5')  That was too easy for Mead who pounces on a ball which just escapes White. The keeper does well to defend White\u2019s shot and Mead capitalises on an open goal.   Updated at 7.16pm BST    7.04pm    4 min: So close, again Hemp crosses in with White\u2019s head connecting. The shot goes just wide, the Manchester City striker evidently hungry for goals tonight. Walsh has a sloppy touch in the midfield but England recover and get to the box once again. Nikolovska concedes the first corner of the match. Stanway takes the kick with White\u2019s head connecting once again but it\u2019s not a clean touch.     7.02pm    2 min: Predictably England have a strong start to this qualifier with all the possession so far. Hemp is making some great runs and she feeds Stanway to give England their first shot. North Macedonia deal with it well but there is a sense it could be a long evening for the hosts.     7.00pm   Kick-off! North Macedonia 0-0 England  We are underway after the teams take a knee.  How many goals can the Lionesses score this evening? And will North Macedonia\u2019s defence hold up? Kari has emailed me with a clumsy moment, saying: \u201cOnce I had to take the train to a different city for an onstage event. It was in the late afternoon, but the only train I could take arrived at noon. So I figured I\u2019d get lunch near the train station.  \u201cThe train was hours late, so when I got there I was famished, and in a hurry, and went into the first restaurant I saw, which was Italian. I ordered pasta in sauce. Anyway, before I could go on stage I had to buy a new shirt.\u201d Pasta sauce is always going to have consequences, but the taste is worth it right?     6.53pm    The teams are out and the anthems are about to begin! Just five minutes now until kick-off in this qualifier.   Updated at 7.04pm BST    6.50pm    The clumsy moments continue and Lucy is on my level with spilling drinks! She has got in touch and said she got so excited in a club because a great tune came on that she threw her drink. It bounced off the wall, onto a chair and went all over the floor.  Her story is much better than mine and she really painted a picture! Keep the clumsy moments coming, I\u2019m comforted that I am not the only person doing this. If you\u2019re confused by this discussion, I shared earlier I spilled a pint of juice on my cream carpet while trying to charge my laptop. What a start to my shift!     6.45pm    Other discussions have been around why Wiegman would play Ellen White instead of giving Alessia Russo experience. It\u2019s a difficult decision as you want to put your best foot forward, no matter the opposition, but players do need that experience - especially ahead of a big tournament. What do you think? I\u2019d love to hear your opinions.     6.40pm    England selection has a lot of discussion around it among fans and media just though the pure strength in depth the Lionesses have. One of the positions which is highly contested is goalkeeper with Hannah Hampton getting the shirt this evening. Manager Sarina Wiegman told ITV when asked who is her number one choice in goal was: \u201cAt this moment Mary Earps is our number 1, the goalkeepers are pushing each other very hard.  \u201cIt\u2019s a luxury to have [many] keepers at this level. Hannah has been playing well at her club [Aston Villa] and she hasn\u2019t had that much experience at this level.\u201d     6.33pm    I\u2019ve had some responses on the clumsy front and it has made me feel better! Francesca has said she once ran over her laptop with her car.  I have so many questions and I don\u2019t know if we have time before kick-off at 7pm! How did this occur? Was the laptop okay afterwards? Why was the laptop on the floor in the first place? Get you clumsy moments in via Twitter or email!     6.28pm    Leah Williamson may not be involved this evening due to concussion protocols but it has been a proud week for the Arsenal star. Sarina Wiegman has named her as the permanent captain for the Lionesses. Steph Houghton has been plagued with injury and the manager is looking for some continuity ahead of the Euros this summer. Today\u2019s skipper Millie Bright is the vice-captain with record scorer Ellen White the third in line.  Williamson said of being named captain earlier this week: \u201cI am honoured to be asked to lead us at the Euros.  \u201cSteph Houghton is one of this country\u2019s all-time greats and to follow in her footsteps - and all of those special names who have led the team in the past - means so much.\u201d Read the full story here.     6.22pm    Frankie has got in touch with some concern about what flavour of juice is that I\u2019ve spilled all over my cream carpet. It was a refreshing peach so the stain isn\u2019t as bad as it would have been with a blackcurrant. But it wasn\u2019t the best moment of my day! Share your clumsy stories with me or stain advice on Twitter or email.     6.15pm    Ellen White starts this evening and could add another record to her name. She is already the Lionesses\u2019 top-scorer but she could also catch Wayne Rooney\u2019s record of 53 goals. The Manchester City star has 49 scores and so she has the fixtures against North Macedonia and Northern Ireland to either equal Rooney\u2019s record with four goals or beat it with five. It will be a tall order but, with the Lionesses beating North Macedonia 8-0 the last time the two teams faced on another, it\u2019s not an impossible feat.     6.07pm    Just before the blog went live I opened my juice which I treated myself to at the coffee shop. I jumped up to charge my laptop and managed to clip the juice with my heel, I don\u2019t know how, and it\u2019s gone all over the carpet. I\u2019ve whacked vanish on it, hopefully it doesn\u2019t stain as I\u2019m renting and that will come out of my deposit! So to make myself feel better please tell me some of your clumsiest moments. Or if you know how to get a juice stain out that would be much appreciated! Let me know via Twitter (@rendellx) or by email.     6.02pm    England have revealed their line-up for tonight\u2019s qualifier and it sees Millie Bright captain the side. Leah Williamson is out due to concussion protocols. The starting XI is: Hampton, Bronze, Stokes, Walsh, Carter, Bright, Mead, Stanway, White, Toone, Hemp. Substitutes: Earps, Daly, Zelem, George, Parris, Nobbs, Russo, Scott, Roebuck.  North Macedonia, who host this evening, have also announced their squad. The starting 11 is: Panchurova, Boseska, Petrovska, Nikolovska, Joshevska, Velkova, Jakovska, Mustafa, Andonova, Maksuti, Rochi. Substitutes: Veleska, Gjorgjevska, Shemsovikj, Markovska, Saliihi, Samardzievska, Nikolova, Stojkovska, Petrushevska, Choneva, Pavlovska.  Updated at 6.10pm BST    6.00pm   Preamble  Hello and welcome to England\u2019s World Cup qualifier against North Macedonia!  The Lionesses are currently sat at the top of Group D with their opponents this evening in fifth. Sarina Wiegman\u2019s women are favourites to bag another win but North Macedonia will be looking to stem the bleeding of goals.  The last time these two sides met England raced to a 8-0 victory but they will be without many stars in this qualifier. Beth England and Niamh Charles had to withdraw after testing positive for Covid. Captain Leah Williamson has travelled with the team but she won\u2019t be playing due to concussion protocols.   Alex Greenwood and Lotte Wubben-Moy are also both out with injury.  Some fans may also be wondering where Fran Kirby is, she is being rested by Chelsea and so won\u2019t participate in today\u2019s qualifier or Tuesday\u2019s against Northern Ireland.   Despite the absences, England have a lot of stars to choose from and the team have released their starting XI so stay tuned for updates ...  Updated at 6.04pm BST "

                    "body": "The luxury carmaker Porsche could be valued at as much as \u20ac75bn when it floats on the Frankfurt stock exchange later this month, which would make it one of the largest European public offerings to date, according to the pricing of shares by its parent company, Volkswagen. Volkswagen, which is planning to float 12.5% on 29 September, has priced the shares in Porsche at between \u20ac76.50 (\u00a367.14) and \u20ac82.50. The \u20ac70bn to \u20ac75bn valuation range, the midpoint of analysts\u2019 expectations, will result in Volkswagen receiving \u20ac8.7bn to \u20ac9.4bn.  The company has said it intends to use 49% of the proceeds to pay a one-off special dividend to shareholders, with the remainder to help fund the costly shift towards electric vehicles and battery technology. The listing will comprise 911m shares, a nod to the historic car brand\u2019s most famous model, divided into 455.5m preferred shares and 455.5m ordinary shares. Up to 113.8m of the preferred shares, carrying no voting rights, will be placed with investors in what will be Germany\u2019s second largest initial public offering to date. If Porsche hits its upper-end valuation it will become Europe\u2019s third largest stock market float on record, according to Refinitiv data. The sovereign wealth funds of Qatar, Abu Dhabi and Norway as well as the mutual fund company T Rowe Price will subscribe up to \u20ac3.68bn worth of preferred shares. \u201cWe are now in the home stretch with the IPO plans for Porsche and welcome the commitment of our cornerstone investors,\u201d the Volkswagen chief financial officer and chief operating officer, Arno Antlitz, said. As part of the partial float, the Porsche-Pi\u00ebch families, who are VW\u2019s anchor shareholders, will buy a further 12.5% of Porsche, at a premium of 7.5% on the price of the shares offered to the general public.

                    "body": "So whose side are you on in the fallout following Kylian Mbapp\u00e9\u2019s decision to stay with Paris Saint-Germain? Watching the extraordinary outrage in Spain, with the press accusing the Frenchman of lacking class and La Liga branding the deal as \u201cscandalous\u201d, has raised eyebrows. But not as many as PSG being able to stump up a \u20ac200m-plus package for the world\u2019s best player \u2013 despite making a \u20ac224m loss last year.\nThere are no good guys here, only a gnawing unease that the laws of economic gravity are being defied to the further detriment of the game we love. As La Liga put it in an unprecedented attack, the transfer showed that state-owned clubs, such as the Qatar-run PSG, \u201cdo not respect and do not want to respect the rules of a sector as important as football\u201d and that \u201csporting integrity\u201d was at stake.\n\nThey are big claims and La Liga has backed them up with a vow to file a complaint to Uefa and the EU. Yet Real Madrid are hardly paragons of virtue in this area. Last year they were central to the European Super League project, which threatened the sporting integrity of European football far more than Mbapp\u00e9 staying with PSG. Recently they were also one of four Spanish clubs ordered by the EU\u2019s highest court to pay back millions of euros after it ruled they had benefited from state aid.\nPSG have privately brushed off La Liga\u2019s attacks, with one executive insisting to me that its \u20ac224m loss was allowed under the current Uefa financial fair play rules, which were loosened because of the pandemic. It is also understood that at a PSG board meeting this month it was revealed that Lionel Messi made the club \u20ac15m last season, even after all his costs were taken into account.\nThe message was clear. Yes, Mbapp\u00e9\u2019s deal is crazily expensive. But the club believe they can make that money back and abide by Uefa\u2019s new financial fair play rules that come into effect in 2025.\nPerhaps. But cynics will hope the rules are more robust than the previous incarnation, which proved easier to circumvent than the Maginot Line \u2013 with PSG and Manchester City among those found guilty. There are also well-founded fears that state-run clubs are creating inflationary pressures in the transfer market, while PSG\u2019s chief executive Nasser al-Khelaifi\u2019s enormous influence across Uefa and the European Club Association is also impossible to ignore.\nTo my mind, though, the reaction to Mbapp\u00e9\u2019s new deal goes beyond the understandable squeamishness about sovereign wealth funds running clubs. It is also about how easy it is for the teams to entrench their advantage and ruin leagues. Would anyone bet against PSG, who have won eight of the past 10 Ligue 1 titles, winning next year? And the year after that? Or Bayern Munich, who have won 10 Bundesliga titles in a row, another procession?\n\nOf course there are exceptions \u2013 look at Manchester United. But while English football is certainly more unpredictable, as was seen again on a dramatic final day, Manchester City have still won four Premier League titles in five years and just eight clubs have finished in the top three in the past 25 years. Eight! \u2013 the same number as in the first five years of the Premier League between 1992-93 and 1996-97, when Norwich, Blackburn and Aston Villa all challenged for the title.\nData from the website Sporting Intelligence, which tracks player salaries across multiple leagues and sports, shows there is a strong link between the amount a club spend on wages and where they finish in the table. But it does not have to be that way.\nIn the US, where salary caps, luxury taxes and drafts for college players ensure that the major leagues are kept spicy and dicey, the difference is stark. Major League Baseball has had eight World Series winners in the past decade and five further teams finishing as runners-up. In other words, 13 of the MLB\u2019s 30 teams have fought for the sport\u2019s biggest prize in the past 10 years.\nIn the NHL, meanwhile, 14 of the league\u2019s 32 clubs have played in a Stanley Cup final since 2012. In the NFL the figure is 13 out of 32, with some teams able to go from also\u2011rans to Super Bowl contenders within a couple of years.\nCuriously, though, that lack of football\u2019s competitive balance has not dented the game\u2019s popularity. One explanation, based on detailed analysis of the data by the economists Dr Babatunde Buraimo and Dr Rob Simmons, is that TV audiences are far less interested in watching competitive matches than they once were \u2013 and instead they want the big names, regardless of the opposition.\nAnd there is no one bigger than Mbapp\u00e9 right now. According to one football executive I spoke to, the deal emphasises an even bigger shift in power in favour of players, more of whom are content to run down their contracts deliberately so they get all the money from a new deal.\n\nThat executive also pointed out that it made sense for Mbapp\u00e9 to wait and play off PSG and Real Madrid. And also for PSG to pay a huge signing-on fee rather than have to sign another player from a competitor club.\nIt is hard to argue with that. But whether football\u2019s ghoulish freakonomics is as beneficial for the rest of us is another matter entirely."

                    "body": "J\u00fcrgen Klopp believes Fenway Sports Group\u2019s search for fresh investment is necessary to allow Liverpool to compete for the best talents on the market. The Liverpool manager, who will miss today\u2019s meeting with Southampton after being handed a one-match ban for his red card against Manchester City last month, has welcomed the decision of the club\u2019s owner to seek investment. While Klopp is unsure about the size of the stake that could be sold or the timeframe, is confident it will increase his spending power. With Jude Bellingham likely to be priced at \u00a3100m or more next summer, should Borussia Dortmund decide to sell the Liverpool target, Klopp admits the club may need to change its spending model to continue to sign proven quality.  \u201cIn the structure we had we were obviously able to spend money but we always had to look and say: \u2018What did we earn?\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cThat was always the situation. The two biggest transfers we did in the past with Ali [Alisson] and Virg [Virgil van Dijk], we all know how it happened. We got some money from Barcelona [\u00a3142m for Philippe Coutinho] and spent it wisely, I would say. \u201cHow we did it so far brought us to where we are, fine, but fresh money is no mistake, let me say it like this,\u201d Klopp added. \u201cNothing gets cheaper. There is the inflation rate for all of us and in football as well. Sometimes you have to spend. \u201cWe are really happy, really happy, to give all our young kids a chance. I am so positive about the impact they will have in the future whenever that starts. Like Harvey [Elliott] now, Stefan [Bajcetic], Calvin [Ramsay], Ben Doak, Bobby Clark \u2013 really interesting. They all are. But from time to time you have to throw in proven quality. And in an ideal world, they are young as well and not 35. \u201cFrom time to time you have to take some risk and we will see. I have no idea what will happen but I am positive about it. If in the end it is not positive, then I can start worrying, but I just think everything will be fine.\u201d  Klopp believes potential investors will be attracted by Liverpool\u2019s global stature and the prospect of buying into a stable club with a young generation of talent coming through. \u201cThat is my feeling as well,\u201d he replied when asked whether Liverpool, with Anfield\u2019s redevelopment to be completed next year and a new training ground in place, were positioned to achieve more success. \u201cWe are not in the table like it should be, so the football could be more stable, but the club itself is incredibly stable. The stuff we put together in the last years is outstanding. \u201cWe have a coaching staff and manager who have committed long term, all really stable, and everybody is on fire. This club is already one of the biggest in the world but we have to keep going. Setbacks are normal but when you are stable you can go from there again and that is what is going through my mind.\u201d Klopp will miss Liverpool\u2019s final Premier League game before the winter break, at home to Southampton on Saturday, after being handed an immediate one-match suspension by the Football Association.  The FA successfully appealed against the \u00a330,000 fine originally imposed on Klopp, arguing the punishment was too lenient. Klopp was dismissed for haranguing the assistant referee, Gary Beswick, in the closing minutes of Liverpool\u2019s 1-0 win over Manchester City on 16 October. Liverpool are understood to be disappointed by the decision but accept the outcome, with Klopp having already admitted to a charge of improper conduct. The club are also unhappy with an appeal process that led to their manager being banned within 24 hours of kick-off."

                    "body": "Good morning. As winter arrives in Ukraine, sleet and snow will become a daily fact of life. Depending on the severity of the weather, the ground will become impassably muddy, or freeze over. Civilians in parts of the country will be left without power, heating or water as a result of Russian attacks on infrastructure, and could face frostbite, hypothermia and pneumonia. Temperatures will get as low as -20C. While the months ahead look grim, the question of how these drastically changing conditions will impact the progress of the war is more complicated. For today\u2019s newsletter, I spoke to Julian Borger, reporting for the Guardian from Kyiv, about how both sides will hope to use the circumstances to their advantage \u2013 and how the prospects for diplomacy could be shaped by the facts on the ground. Here are the headlines. Five big stories  China | Hundreds of demonstrators and police have clashed in Shanghai as protests over China\u2019s stringent Covid restrictions flared for a third day and spread to several cities. The BBC said its accredited reporter Ed Lawrence was beaten when he was detained by police in Shanghai for several hours. NHS | Brexit has worsened the UK\u2019s acute shortage of doctors in key areas of care and led to more than 4,000 European doctors choosing not to work in the NHS, new research reveals. The NHS in England alone has vacancies for 10,582 physicians. Labour | Keir Starmer has categorically ruled out the return of free movement between Britain and the EU if he were to become prime minister, despite supporting the policy three years ago. Transport | One of the north of England\u2019s main railway companies, the TransPennine Express, has been using an \u201coutrageous\u201d legal loophole to significantly underreport cancellations. Trains preemptively cancelled up to 10pm the night before are not included in official statistics, turning a rate of 20-30% to reported figures as low as 5.6%. Television | Former health secretary Matt Hancock finished third on I\u2019m a Celebrity ... Get Me Out of Here!, with retired footballer Jill Scott the eventual winner. Hancock, who lost the Tory whip over his appearance, was left with a toad sitting on his head at the end of the final challenge, \u201cFlood Your Face\u201d.  In depth: \u2018Winter will bring fairly heavy attrition with death and illness\u2019  *** The situation today: \u2018stop-go phases to the conflict\u2019 To date, the Pentagon estimates that around 100,000 Russian soldiers have been killed or wounded during the war, and about the same number of Ukrainian troops. Around 40,000 civilians are also thought to have died. That devastating toll continues to grow, but \u201cthere are real stop-go phases to the conflict now\u201d, Julian Borger said. While Ukrainian troops have been in the ascendancy for some time, \u201cafter the Russians made the decision to abandon Kherson and regroup on the left bank of the river Dnipro, we are in a slower phase\u201d. If Ukraine is to continue its counter-offensive in the south, its forces could attempt to advance in neighbouring Zaporizhzhia oblast, where it already holds the left bank of the Dnipro. \u201cZaporizhzhia may be the next focus. But the pace of the conflict isn\u2019t by any means uniform,\u201d Julian said. And, as weather worsens, what happens next may be decided in part by forces beyond the control of either side. *** The front: will the ground be muddy or frozen? Biden administration officials expect the winter months to bring \u201ca slowdown in military advances on both sides\u201d that could last as long as six months, the New York Times reported earlier this month \u2013 though that is not a universal view. In a 10 November assessment, the respected US thinktank the Institute for the Study of War (ISW) said that it \u201cdoes not assess the fighting in Ukraine will halt or enter a stalemate due to winter weather, despite faulty western assumptions\u201d. The ISW says it expects that \u201cwell-supplied Ukrainian forces are unlikely to halt their counteroffensives due to the arrival of winter weather\u201d. In the short term, the ISW said on Saturday, the pace of operations has slowed in recent days because of bad weather but is likely to accelerate as the ground freezes because of a forecast temperature drop this week. To a large extent, the nature of the conflict on the front lines will continue to depend on the severity of the weather. \u201cIf it\u2019s really boggy, you can\u2019t go anywhere with armour,\u201d Julian said. \u201cThat was the thinking behind the original invasion \u2013 Russia went in February at one of the coldest points because of worries about what muddy terrain would mean north of Kyiv.\u201d But while frozen ground would make equipment more manoeuvrable for both sides, very cold weather would also be punishing for poorly supplied and inexperienced Russian troops. \u201cNothing could be worse than being a Russian conscript sent to the front,\u201d Julian said. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen footage of them camping outside, in very thin tents \u2013 it\u2019s miserable. And you would imagine winter will bring fairly heavy attrition with death and illness.\u201d *** Russia\u2019s response: \u2018freeze Ukraine to death\u2019 If there is a slowdown at the front, Russia will seek to use the pause to mobilise those 300,000 conscripts, whatever the cost, and hope to bring into play the Iranian missiles that they have ordered to replenish their depleted stocks. \u201cWe don\u2019t know if those are in Russia yet,\u201d Julian said. The other part of their strategy appears to be \u201cto freeze Ukraine to death\u201d, Julian said. Russia is attacking Ukrainian energy infrastructure and may intensify its assault on the country\u2019s water supply, with both power and water out in 15 regions including Kyiv last week. Nato countries are stepping up the delivery of power transformers and electricity generators in response. On Thursday, Julian wrote, 70% of Kyiv was without power, and \u201cthere was water everywhere, but very little to drink\u201d. The severity of that approach is also apparent in Kherson, as reported in this piece by Lorenzo Tondo and Isobel Khoshiw: they write that civilians are gathering firewood but have been warned not to head into the woods without consulting the military \u201cbecause Russian troops may have left behind mines, tripwires and unexploded shells\u201d. But, they add: \u201cWith the price of firewood rising, many have no choice but to take the risk. If a mine doesn\u2019t kill them, the cold might.\u201d *** Ukraine\u2019s response: press advantage, maintain morale  Ukraine wants to maintain the momentum of its recent battlefield successes for as long as it can. The head of Ukraine\u2019s national security and defence council, Oleksiy Danilov, was \u201cabsolutely insistent that the weather isn\u2019t an issue and they will press on\u201d, Julian said of a conversation with the official last week. Ukraine may be less hampered by the winter because its supply lines are shorter than Russia\u2019s. If there is a pause, \u201cthat will arguably allow them to regroup and re-arm faster than the Russians if they can keep the flows of equipment coming from the west\u201d, Julian said \u2013 pointing in particular to air defence systems needed to blunt Russian attacks on infrastructure. Western analysts also expect an increase in sabotage operations, and even targeted assassinations, behind Russian lines. The other key question for Ukrainians is whether widespread opposition to a negotiated peace will persist. \u201cThe stories we\u2019re writing are not about smiley, happy people defying Putin,\u201d Julian said. \u201cBut it is almost impossible to imagine an upswell in demand for some kind of peace deal with territory given away. The kind of punishment meted out by the Russians will be miserable, but they know who to blame.\u201d As one Kyiv resident told him last week: \u201cDo you remember the siege of Leningrad? They lived through that and we can live through this. We can live through anything.\u201d *** Will there be new pressure for talks? Earlier this month, General Mark Milley, the chairman of the US joint chiefs of staff, said the winter would present a \u201ca window of opportunity for negotiations\u201d \u2013 and while he later walked those remarks back, \u201cit shows that that view is out there in Washington\u201d, Julian said. \u201cThe Ukrainians very vehemently reject that.\u201d In an analysis published by the thinktank Rusi last week, Jack Watling and Nick Reynolds wrote that while some western allies were pressurising Kyiv to consider negotiating a truce, that would be \u201ctactically advantageous for Russia in stabilising its control over the occupied territories\u201d and was unlikely to end Russia\u2019s ambition of subjugating Ukraine. Even if Milley\u2019s remarks do not represent the view of the Biden administration at the moment, the Republican party\u2019s control of the House of Representatives after the midterm elections may change the calculus, Julian said. \u201cBiden is getting a lot of aid out of the door during this lame duck session. I think the balance of views is that those in the Republican party who would end support are not dominant, but there is a question mark. At the moment, the single biggest worry for Ukraine\u2019s ability to wage this war is the politics in Washington.\u201d What else we\u2019ve been reading  Bethan McKernan spoke to entrepreneur Rasha Khouri and Palestinian chef Fadi Kattan about their new restaurant, Akub, which focuses on bringing the essence of Palestinian food to London. \u201cThat\u2019s really what I want this to be,\u201d says Khouri, \u201ca celebration of the nuances of Palestinian food and cooking and heritage.\u201d Nimo Claire Armitstead\u2019s piece for the Observer about the contested present and surprising history of pronouns is a fascinating, vital account of how a \u201cgrammatical convenience\u201d became \u201cso much more than that\u201d.

In the early 20th century, European archeologists relied on the work of teams of Kenyan excavators to find ancient monuments during archeological digs. The white scholars would then write books on these digs, taking sole credit without mentioning the dozens of native people whose expert local knowledge about the ancient sites had led to the discoveries. It was a common colonial practice to \u201cforget\u201d the crucial contributions of Africans to uncovering their own history. To rectify this, exhibitions which are due to take place in museums in Mombasa and London, are showing unseen photographs of previously nameless and faceless people that place them at these digs. The photographs are a key part of correcting historical records and will hopefully begin the process of giving these excavators their deserved recognition.

                    "body": "GOING TO THE MATCH \u2026 2023\nThe Fiver didn\u2019t get where it is today planning things well in advance. Why, just this afternoon we\u2019d sat through a 13-minute Gary O\u2019Neil press conference on YouTube with a view to writing some biting satire about tonight\u2019s match between West Ham and the Bournemouth side he remains in caretaker charge of through his third prime minister, only for the arrival of an email in our inbox to prompt the kind of U-turn to rival those of the most self-serving Tory lickspittles in the past 24 hours.\nSo, while we leave Gary to \u201cget the boys ready for West Ham \u2026 go again and continue to work hard and improve\u201d, it behoves The Fiver to give the work of our good friends at the Football Supporters\u2019 Association some big licks, and not simply because it\u2019s getting towards that time of year when they empty the contents of their bulging ballot boxes in order to honour various Big Papers, writers, podcasters and cartoonists named Squires among other categories, all of whom can be voted for here.\nNever happy unless there\u2019s a giant bee buzzing around their football-supporting bonnet, today the FSA raised the hoary old issue of TV scheduling and the Premier League\u2019s almost total disregard for matchgoing fans. It is a drum they have beaten more often and more violently than Keith Moon in his pomp but the powers that be in Premier League Towers have covered their ears with noise-cancelling headphones in order to drown out the unseemly din.\n\n\u201cSupporters groups from across the country have expressed their anger at the Premier League and its broadcasters for the latest delay in releasing TV fixtures,\u201d thunders the FSA in an article they flagged up to the great, the good and The Fiver about 30 seconds before the Premier League finally hit the button on said TV fixtures. \u201cThe TV selections for December and January covering the busy Christmas and New Year schedule were due to be published by Friday 11th October but at the time of publishing [this story] were 13 days late. This has meant many fans wanting to book travel to games in the busy December period are potentially losing out on cheaper travel options.\u201d\nA cursory look at the now-announced fixtures shows that on 3 January, Bournemouth play at Old Trafford at 8pm, while at the same time several thousand Geordies will be in That London for Arsenal v Newcastle. Both sets of travelling fans will make it because they always do (though some might not make it back given the last trains home will have long gone), and it is no doubt on this blind loyalty that the Premier League and various TV networks count as they dither over which matches to show and when. On the plus side, at least they got their act together in order to schedule West Ham v Bournemouth on Monday night, a match potential viewers with no affiliation to either team will almost certainly be ignoring in their droves.\nLIVE ON BIG WEBSITE\nJoin Will Unwin at 8pm for red-hot minute-by-minute updates on West Ham 1-0 Bournemouth.\nQUOTE OF THE DAY\n\u201cAt first he seems standoffish but he\u2019s the sweetest, humblest person you\u2019ll ever meet.

                    "body": "It took less than a minute to reignite the feud. Hans Niemann v Magnus Carlsen at the Julius Baer Generation Cup opened conventionally with 1 d2-d4 Ng8-f6 2 c2-c4. But then Carlsen disappeared from the screen, the commentators were aghast, while Niemann shrugged and then also disconnected. The world champion\u2019s father, Henrik Carlsen, had already announced that his normally media-friendly son would give no press interviews during the tournament. The action was captured live on the chess24 broadcast.\nMonday\u2019s cameo was the sequel to the controversial incident earlier this month across the board at the $350,000 Sinquefield Cup in St Louis. Carlsen was outplayed by Niemann, suffering a rare defeat as White, and withdrew from the tournament.\nHe then published a cryptic tweet alongside a video of the football manager Jos\u00e9 Mourinho saying: \u201cIf I speak, I am in big trouble.\u201d\n\nNiemann admitted to being banned twice by chess.com for cheating online, but denied cheating over the board. The St Louis organisers explained all their many anti-cheating procedures and emphasised there had been no wrongdoing at their event.\nNorway\u2019s world champion eased his way to the semi-finals by a 3-1 margin against the world No 10 Levon Aronian, but the controversial US 19-year-old was eliminated by a 2.5-1.5 score against Le Quang Liem, 31, the current Asian champion and a former world blitz champion. Their fourth and final game proved decisive when Vietnam\u2019s top player created a passed central pawn and advanced it victoriously.\nAttention now shifts to the statement which Carlsen has promised for Monday, the day after the Julius Baer Cup ends, explaining the reasons for his withdrawal from the Sinquefield Cup earlier this month and for his resignation on move two against Niemann this week.\nMonday\u2019s bizarre occurrence is almost without precedent in international chess. Bobby Fischer and Vlad Kramnik defaulted games in world championship matches, but their protests were against organisational decisions. The nearest precedent is probably the 1 c4 Resigns of Fischer v Oscar Panno at the 1970 interzonal, when the Argentinian grandmaster resigned in protest at changes in the schedule to accommodate the religious beliefs of Fischer and Samuel Reshevsky.\n\nEngland\u2019s leading female player, Jovanka Houska, accused Carlsen of \u201cpouring more fuel on the fire\u201d of the controversy. On Norwegian TV, Carlsen\u2019s former teammate and aide, Jon Ludvig Hammer, called for sanctions. \u201cIt\u2019s the most unacceptable behaviour to lose on purpose,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s the most unsportsmanlike thing you can do.\u201d\nIt is believed Carlsen chose to make a single move rather than none at all so as to technically fulfil his contract with the organisers. If one or both players fails to make a move, the game counts as a default and not as a completed game.\nCarlsen finally broke his silence on Wednesday night when he told Norway\u2019s TV2 that he is likely to make a statement on Monday, after the end of the Julius Baer Generation Cup. The world champion added that he understands very well \u201cthat the situation is unfortunate for many\u201d. In another interview, with chess24\u2019s Kaja Snare, Carlsen was asked directly: \u201cWhat was the reason you withdrew from the Niemann game?\u201d and replied: \u201cUnfortunately I cannot particularly speak on that, but people can draw their own conclusions and they certainly have.\u201d\nIn a new Chessbase article, Prof Ken Regan, widely regarded as the leading authority on anti-cheating, reveals he has examined all Niemann\u2019s over the board and online games for the past two years and found no evidence against the American. In particular, Regan analysed Niemann\u2019s games at the 2022 Capablanca Memorial in Cuba, where there had been several claims of cheating, and found that while Niemann\u2019s accuracy rate was normal, his opponents had underperformed, in a similar way to games of Mikhail Tal and Alexei Shirov in past decades.\n\nIn his streaming broadcasts, Hikaru Nakamura, the world No 6, has claimed Niemann\u2019s rate of improvement has been faster than other prodigies and is therefore suspect. The reality is that Niemann, at age 19, is far from the top prospect among the fast-rising teenage generation. He is the same age as Alireza Firouzja, fresh from his brilliant success at the Sinquefield Cup, but is around 90 rating points behind the Iranian-born Frenchman. He has a similar rating to Uzbekistan\u2019s Nodirbek Abdusattorov and the Indian pair Rameshbabu Praggnanandhaa and Dommaraju Gukesh, but the trio are all two to three years younger than the American. Gukesh is playing in the Spanish League, where he won in fine style against England\u2019s Gawain Jones on Sunday.\nNiemann wants to be world champion, but his four rivals have the same ambition. That probably means, in terms of his spat with Carlsen, their paths are likely to cross less frequently in future and that will be accentuated by organisers knowing they cannot include them both.\nIn Monday\u2019s fifth round, immediately before the fateful rendezvous with Carlsen, Niemann was paired with the tournament leader, Arjun Erigaisi, and (see board above) made the kind of basic error a 1700 player should be ashamed of, let alone a 2700.\nIn complete contrast to the above disaster, Niemann had scored brilliantly in 21 moves against world No 10 Levon Aronian on Tuesday night to initially keep his quarter-final hopes alive. At the end 21...Kd7 22 Qe7+ Kc6 23 Nd4 is checkmate.\n3834 1 Qxe5! and mate next move."

                    "body": "I think the Ireland rugby union captain and head coach, Johnny Sexton and Andy Farrell, have a valid point about lowering the tackle height to the waist, a variable anatomical landmark (Johnny Sexton criticises RFU for lowering tackle height for amateurs, 23 January).  My experience includes playing amateur schools rugby at a high level in Ireland and being the doctor for Launceston Rugby Club and Cornwall RFU. (This included time when Launceston were at a high level, playing professional teams.) I have seen the game get faster, more physical, and sometimes indisciplined. As a doctor, I am most concerned about the risks of long-term neurological damage. As a spectator, I love to see good, open rugby. Having studied and taught anatomy, could I suggest a better option: all rugby shirts should have a clear horizontal line at the level of the junction between the upper, backward angled section of the breastbone (the sternum) and the lower, long part. Then every player, from child to veteran, could see that line and tackle below it. This would give more clarity to match officials. I believe this would reduce head and neck injuries.Dr Danny LangDeal, Kent \u2022 I have followed the debate about rugby tackling height rules with interest (RFU\u2019s Bill Sweeney facing calls to resign over tackle height rule-change debacle, 27 January). At my boys\u2019 secondary school in 1960s Middlesbrough, our one hour per week PE lesson used to alternate between football and rugby. The first 15 minutes of the latter was tackling practice, and involved one of us \u2013 selected randomly \u2013 standing side-on at the end of the gym while, one at a time, the other 30 would charge from the other end and launch themselves horizontally to hit you in the middle of the thigh with their shoulder. Any tackle higher or lower was called as a foul. It was easy to spot who had been the tackle \u201ctarget\u201d the next day, as they always had an angry bruise visible under their shorts. Not surprisingly, we all preferred football weeks.Andrew KeeleyWarrington, Cheshire \u2022 With reference to the RFU\u2019s decision to lower the legal tackle height at amateur level, in the 1930s, when WH Auden wrote the school song for Raynes Park county grammar, he recognised in verse three that tackling high was unmanly, which remained the case for many years: \u201cMan has mind but body also; / So we learn to tackle low / Bowl the off-breaks, hit the sixes, / Bend the diver\u2019s brilliant bow.\u201d When did it become unfashionable to be taught otherwise?Michael BurnsNew Malden, London \u2022 Thank you for your reporting on the growing concern about brain injuries affecting rugby players (Amateur players launch lawsuit against rugby authorities over brain injuries, 19 January). As a spectator of international and club rugby, I feel increasingly conflicted that the entertainment that I have enjoyed watching in the stands and on TV may have contributed to players developing neurodegenerative diseases. Injuries are part of a contact sport like rugby, but brain injuries that lead to young men and women not being able to live normal lives after retirement from the sport are not acceptable. Short of boycotting the game altogether, what should supporters do to put pressure on rugby authorities to make it safer?Ian ColtartThoiry, France"

                    "body": "Key Netball Australia sponsors have denied reports they are considering walking away from the code after Gina Rinehart\u2019s mining firm Hancock Prospecting pulled out of a $15m funding deal, because of player concerns about its record on Indigenous affairs. The saga over the mining billionaire\u2019s sponsorship of Netball Australia came to a head on Saturday after her company announced it was withdrawing from its $15m funding deal. It followed reports Indigenous player Donnell Wallam and her Australian Diamonds teammates had expressed discomfort about wearing the company\u2019s logo on their uniforms, due to concerns about its record on Indigenous issues. The decision to withdraw the funding \u2013 as well as sponsorship agreements with Netball Western Australia and the West Coast Fever team \u2013 is a severe blow to the code, which has suffered losses of more than $7m in two Covid-affected years.  Reports on Monday suggested other sponsors were considering pulling out, quoting anonymous sources suggesting the saga could cost the code an additional $10m. But major sponsors have confirmed they intend to stand by the sport. Principal sponsor Suncorp said it was \u201cvery proud\u201d to be associated with the sport. \u201cSuncorp is very proud of our longstanding principal partnership of Netball Australia, as the leading women\u2019s team sport in participation and our commitment to supporting the game from the grassroots community level through to Suncorp Super Netball, and the national Diamonds team,\u201d a company spokesperson said.  Sign up for our free morning newsletter and afternoon email to get your daily news roundup  \u201cAs a sponsor, Suncorp is not responsible for the sport\u2019s commercial and operational decisions that fall under Netball Australia\u2019s governance.\u201d Other major sponsors echoed those comments. Insurance firm HCF said it was \u201cproud\u201d of its partnership with the code, which had seen it \u201cempower those within the netball community to lead healthier, more active lives\u201d over the last four years. \u201cWe\u2019re proud of this partnership and are currently in commercial discussions with Netball Australia regarding future seasons of sponsorship,\u201d HCF said. Naming sponsor Origin Energy confirmed it would remain an active supporter.  Major sponsor Nissan said it recently extended its sponsorship for a further five years. \u201cWe are proud this support spans from grassroots to international competition for the biggest female sport in Australia,\u201d a spokesperson said. It comes as the head of the Netball Player\u2019s Association, Kathryn Harby-Williams, said a compromise had been struck between the code\u2019s governing body and the Diamonds prior to Hancock\u2019s decision. Harby-Williams told ABC\u2019s grandstand that the players had been willing to wear the company\u2019s logo on its uniforms during the Constellation Cup against New Zealand, which the Diamonds won on Sunday. \u201cWe had come to an agreement with Netball Australia where everyone was comfortable that would happen and that Donnell and the players would not be required to wear the logo against England in the three-match series starting shortly,\u201d Harby-Williams said. \u201cAt no point in time did the players seek to have the deal fall off the table but we were certainly willing to come to a compromise and had agreed to that shortly after the players stood by Donnell.\u201d  In two lengthy statements issued over the weekend, Hancock and Rinehart defended their record on Indigenous affairs, pointing to separate funding initiatives, saying it was \u201cunnecessary for sports organisations to be used as the vehicle for social or political causes\u201d. It said there were \u201cmore targeted and genuine ways to progress social or political causes without virtue signalling or for self-publicity\u201d. In 1984 Rinehart\u2019s father, Lang Hancock, the founder of Hancock Prospecting, suggested Indigenous Australians be sterilised to \u201cbreed themselves out\u201d. In the interview, Hancock said: \u201cThose that have been assimilated into, you know, earning [a] good living or earning wages amongst the civilised areas, those that have been accepted into society and they have accepted society and can handle society, I\u2019d leave them well alone\u201d. \u201cThe ones that are no good to themselves and can\u2019t accept things, the half-castes \u2013 and this is where most of the trouble comes \u2013 I would dope the water up so that they were sterile and would breed themselves out in future and that would solve the problem.\u201d"

Pogo also likes to race up with the pace, should get a good position from stall one, and his form behind Kinross \u2013 a 4-1 chance for this \u2013 in August suggests he should not be four times the price of Ralph Beckett\u2019s gelding, who is drawn in the parking lot in stall 13.\n\nWincanton 12.40 ITV Racing\u2019s 10-hour marathon could kick off with a win for Paul Nicholls\u2019s Sabrina, who gets 15lb from the unbeaten Lady Adare and has promising conditional Freddie Gingell taking off another 10lb.\nDoncaster 12.50 This Listed sprint looks tailor-made for the ultra-consistent Commanche Falls after a third-place finish at Group Three level last time.\nAintree 1.01 Gericault Roque reverts to hurdles after a solid chasing campaign last season and remains unexposed after just three starts over timber.\nWincanton 1.15 Useful hurdler McFabulous makes his chasing debut here but Sebastopol ran to a decent level several times last season and could well put his fencing experience to good use.\nDoncaster 1.30 Sweet Believer has form on heavy ground and looks overpriced at around 4-1 to beat the early favourite, Life Of Dreams.\nWincanton 1.50 Frodon is tricky to weigh up, as he goes well fresh but was a little underwhelming for much of last season. A wind op may help, but Lord Accord, a winner at Cheltenham last month, could be a more solid option.\nAintree 2.11 Lifetime Ambition ran to a high level when second in a Grade One in April and is feasibly weighted on that form.\nDown Royal 2.32 It will be interesting to see how Envoi Allen gets on stepping up to three miles but Galvin, with a race under his belt already this season, should get the better of his former stable companion.\nAintree 2.45 Dashel Drasher is better known as a chaser but has decent form over hurdles too and is likely to get his own way in front.\nWincanton 3.00 The progressive Knappers Hill is one to keep onside after shrugging off a big weight to win a valuable handicap at Chepstow last time.\nDoncaster 3.13 Cemhaan, a thorough stayer who acts on heavy ground, looks to have been saved for this by a shrewd yard and makes plenty of appeal at around 12-1.\nKeeneland 3.50 Ce Ce was a convincing winner of this race at Del Mar 12 months ago, has drawn well in stall four and is attractively priced at around 5-1 for a repeat.\nKeeneland 4.29 Europe\u2019s best sprinters have already succumbed to Highfield Princess at Group One level this season and she may well prove good enough to deny Golden Pal a third Breeders\u2019 Cup success.\n\nKeeneland 5.10 Cody\u2019s Wish made a successful step up to Grade One level last time and is a solid favourite to follow up.\nKeeneland 5.50 Nashwa heads the market for the Gosdens and Hollie Doyle but 6-4 looks short in such a competitive race. Joseph O\u2019Brien\u2019s Above The Curve is lightly-raced and still improving, and good value at around 5-1 to give her trainer a second win in four years in this race.\nKeeneland 6.30 A wide draw could make things a little trickier but the favourite, Jackie\u2019s Warrior, should have enough in hand.\n\nKeeneland 7.55 Nest, runner-up in the Kentucky Oaks in May, could edge out her stable-companion Malathaat in what looks like a Todd Pletcher head-to-head.\nKeeneland 8.40 Apart from a sub-par run in the Derby, Nations Pride has done little wrong this season and can give Charlie Appleby his second Turf win in a row.\nKeeneland 9.40 All eyes on Flightline as he bids for legend status and anything close to his astonishing dominance at Del Mar in September should be more than enough."

                    "body": "Wales have been warned to expect a fast and furious welcome from England at Twickenham on Saturday in a game the home team are billing as a knockout eliminator. With Manu Tuilagi and Courtney Lawes back, Eddie Jones\u2019s side are determined to up the tempo and improve their chances of claiming this year\u2019s Six Nations title. According to Jones\u2019s assistant Martin Gleeson, the former Great Britain rugby league international who is now England\u2019s attack coach, there is a realisation among the players that, as at a World Cup, they must now win their final three games to hoist the trophy.  \u201cIt\u2019s a massive game for us,\u201d Gleeson said. \u201cIt\u2019s the first time crowds have been back for a Six Nations game for a couple of years and we\u2019re treating it like a quarter-final. If we don\u2019t get the result on Saturday, we\u2019re out.\u201d Gleeson will be urging his side to take the game to Wales from the outset, having rated their training session on Tuesday as the best he has seen since he took the job last August. \u201cWe want to take it to them as quickly and early in the game as possible,\u201d he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to be playing in our shell. We want to play the brand of rugby we want straight from the kick-off. We need to have some line speed in defence and hit hard. When we\u2019ve got the ball there\u2019s a few opportunities we can see. We want to play with intent and go after teams.\u201d This go-faster mission statement would appear perfectly suited to a player like Tuilagi, set to feature for the first time since damaging a hamstring against South Africa in the autumn. The statistician Russ Petty has even dug into the archives and found that England have not lost at Twickenham with Tuilagi in their matchday squad since November 2012. \u201cManu can just take the ball, make metres and get us quick ruck ball by himself. Not everyone can do that,\u201d Gleeson said. \u201cThat\u2019s why Manu is the player he is. He\u2019s a guy who can add another dimension to your attack. You don\u2019t always have to create overlaps or gaps in defences; he can punch holes on his own. His acceleration and the power with that is phenomenal. He\u2019ll be good to have in the mix.\u201d  The winds of change, though, continue to blow, with two experienced Joes \u2013 Marchant and Launchbury \u2013 released from the squad last night. In recent days, too, two members of England\u2019s matchday squad from their 2019 Rugby World Cup semi-final win over New Zealand have signalled their retirements, with George Kruis set to join Mark Wilson in stepping away from the game at the age of 32. Both Kruis and Wilson were popular squad men and highly valuable players, with 68 caps for England between them. The former is quitting to devote more time to his burgeoning business career while injury has finally caught up with the latter but, in their different ways, both underline the fierce dedication and sacrifice required to stay at the top of the professional game. It also shows just how swiftly the picture can change from a team-building perspective. There had been talk of Kruis returning to the Premiership with a view to chasing a place in next year\u2019s World Cup in France. Instead Jones and his assistants will have to hope their forward options remain deep enough for it not to matter unduly if they lose any more big men between now and the autumn of 2023. Equally important, though, is to bed in some lasting combinations in key areas rather than simply adding random individuals to the mix here and there. Ben Youngs is set to become England\u2019s most capped player in history this weekend but will be 34 by the time next year\u2019s World Cup kicks off. England\u2019s other two scrum-halves, Harry Randall and Raffi Quirke, have barely started their Test careers and no team in history has won the Webb Ellis Cup with a relative rookie in the No 9 jersey.  Tuilagi and Henry Slade, however, are already a proven midfield double act and, with Owen Farrell still sidelined by injury, the big centre has been seeking to establish a good understanding with Marcus Smith. The pair roomed together during England\u2019s training camp in Jersey and Tuilagi has been trying to put the squad\u2019s younger players at ease. \u201cYou don\u2019t want them to feel pressure,\u201d the 30-year-old said. \u201cWe were just relaxing with nice tea and a couple of biscuits, nice shortbread. That\u2019s the important thing \u2026 to connect and get to know each other.\u201d"

                    "body": "1) Games that should have been held last week The Premier League should not have postponed last weekend\u2019s fixtures. If people are working, it is wrong to confiscate their recreation, and that\u2019s before we consider fans who\u2019d taken time off or paid for transport in order to watch their team. Moreover, there are families relying on football-related income to pay bills and eat food who had their right to earn removed without warning, while cricket, rugby union and \u2013 among others \u2013 polo had the self-confidence to continue. Football is called the people\u2019s game because it was started for the people by the people \u2013 people who sought a bit of weekend fun to escape the drudgery of regular life and forget their place in the order of things, just for a few hours. The suits who\u2019ve expropriated it since would do well to remember that. Daniel Harris  2) Will Forest bounce back from embarrassment? Having allowed Bournemouth to come from two goals behind to beat them, Nottingham Forest face more fellow newcomers in Fulham as they attempt to halt a run of three consecutive defeats, the most recent of which was greeted by rare but audible booing from the City Ground stands. Despite playing without an out-and-out striker, Forest scored twice in the first half against Bournemouth but proved utterly unable to cope with Gary O\u2019Neil\u2019s half-time switch to a back three, when he replaced left-back Jordan Zemura with the more attack-minded wing-back Ryan Fredericks. Having had an extra week on the training ground to put things right and get a better idea of what constitutes his best XI, Steve Cooper will be expecting a reaction from his team in what should be an entertaining game between two attacking teams. With three of their following four games away from home, recent evidence suggests a failure to get one will be a source of worry for all concerned heading into the international break. Barry Glendenning  Nottingham Forest v Fulham, Friday 8pm (all times BST)  3) A possible Villa keeper conundrum Five years ago Filip Marschall hadn\u2019t even worn a pair of goalkeeping gloves but, if injuries do not abate as Steven Gerrard anticipates by the time Southampton visit Villa Park on Friday, then the 19-year-old could start between the sticks. Marschall joined Villa in 2018 from Cambridge City, for whom he played as a defender until the age of 13. Emi Mart\u00ednez missed training on Thursday owing to illness and Robin Olsen because of a knee problem, while Jed Steer is a long-term absentee with an achilles injury. Gerrard hopes Mart\u00ednez will be fit in time. Marschall was part of Gerrard\u2019s squad on Villa\u2019s pre-season trip to Australia and recently signed a new long-term contract, but the teenager who was on loan in the sixth tier with Gateshead last season could finish the weekend with a Premier League debut to his name. \u201cHe\u2019s prepared to be ready,\u201d Gerrard said. Ben Fisher  Aston Villa v Southampton, Friday 8pm   4) Costa to be let off Wolves\u2019 leash? The bar has been set. Wolves announced the signing of Diego Costa until the end of the season with a superb video of the chiselled striker keeping three snarling wolves, James, Alice and Gray, shackled and now Bruno Lage must ponder whether to let the 33-year-old off the leash. That clip has gone viral and Costa will be hoping to hit the ground running on his return to England, his last appearance coming for Chelsea in the 2017 FA Cup final defeat by Arsenal. Costa is working to a tailored training programme and said he required \u201ctwo or three weeks to get in shape\u201d, but Lage must be tempted to throw him in against Manchester City. \u201cIf I had ever doubted my potential, I wouldn\u2019t have accepted this challenge,\u201d Costa said this week. \u201cI can bring something to the table.\u201d BF  Wolves v Manchester City, Saturday 12.30pm  5) The highest of standards for City Picking holes in Manchester City and finding fault with Pep Guardiola are foolish things to do, given the former have won three of the last four league titles and the latter is an all-time great manager if he retires tomorrow or never claims another trophy. But the feeling persists that City could and should be even better than they are, not just in defence \u2013 a weak point in all Guardiola teams \u2013 but in attack. It may well be that Leroy San\u00e9 and Raheem Sterling had to be let go, but the fact remains that without them, City lack balance and speed. Of course, they are brilliant at compensating, whether through the rhythm of their passing or ability to conjure a goal out of nothing, but any team willing to stay narrow and defend with discipline and aggression have a chance at frustrating them \u2013 especially if, like Wolves, they also have pace on the counter. DHa  6) Howe urges Newcastle players to aim higher It took Newcastle until 30 November last year to reach the seven-point mark. After only six games they have arrived there this season, but have won only once \u2013 against Nottingham Forest at St James\u2019 Park \u2013 and Eddie Howe is not overjoyed. \u201cI\u2019m not happy, I want more points,\u201d said Newcastle\u2019s manager before giving his squad an apparently stern talking to about the need to achieve and maintain consistently high standards. Despite the likely absence through injury of two key creative players in Allan Saint-Maximin and Bruno Guimar\u00e3es, he will be particularly keen to beat Bournemouth at home on Saturday. Admiration for Howe on Tyneside currently knows few bounds, but the manager is aware Newcastle\u2019s Saudi Arabian owners have spent more than \u00a3200m on new players in less than a year and will feel entitled to see that investment translated into wins. Small wonder Howe is doing everything in his power to ensure his side do not stumble against the team he led to three promotions in six years, but who are still without a permanent manager. Louise Taylor  Newcastle United v Bournemouth, Saturday 3pm  7) Bees to test Arsenal durability Brentford Community Stadium will summon difficult memories for Arsenal, who suffered a chastening defeat there on the opening night of last season, even if it came with Covid-related caveats. Mikel Arteta\u2019s side are a different proposition now but the Bees feel more comfortable as an established top-flight unit, too, so the margins come Sunday lunchtime are likely to be fine. It will be a test for Arsenal\u2019s ability to bounce back after the slightly harsh 3-1 defeat at Old Trafford a fortnight previously, which ended their winning start but did not affect their status as league leaders. Victory this time would ensure they finish this weekend top of the pile and that would be handy given any pretensions at a title bid will be examined thoroughly in the subsequent home meetings with Spurs and Liverpool. Arsenal are about to see their durability scrutinised and would feel well set if they leave west London with three points. Nick Ames  Brentford v Arsenal, Sunday 12pm  8) Conte needs greater stability from Bissouma Antonio Conte intends to rotate his personnel for the visit of Leicester \u2013 after the mentally and physically draining Champions League defeat at Sporting on Tuesday \u2013 but it does not sound as if he is ready to call upon Yves Bissouma. It felt like a coup when Spurs took the Mali midfielder from Brighton for \u00a325m over the summer; here was a player that could add a new dimension in midfield, running with the ball, breaking the lines and creating chances. But it is not simple to play in the middle of Conte\u2019s 3-4-3 formation and the verdict so far on Bissouma, to quote the manager, is that he is \u201cstruggling a bit with the tactical aspect. With the ball he\u2019s really good; defensively he has to pay more attention.\u201d It goes a long way to explain why Bissouma has started only once and totalled 121 minutes in all competitions. He needs time to adapt. David Hytner  Tottenham v Leicester, Saturday 5.30pm   9) Time running out for Rodgers? Brendan Rodgers is an excellent coach \u2013 if you\u2019re not sure, just ask him \u2013 but it might be that he\u2019s running out of road at Leicester, who sit bottom with one point from six games, and travel to unbeaten, third-placed Tottenham this weekend. The malaise is not all his fault, as his board gave him little scope to reinforce this summer, citing FFP regulations and ground improvements as the reason. But it is hard to not to wonder if the pandemic was also influential, reduced travel meaning reduced duty-free income for the King Power group \u2013 a line the club would never speak in public, because who\u2019s going to excuse a parsimonious billionaire during a cost-of-living crisis? Rodgers, though, must also justify any funds allowed to him, which is to say it\u2019s time for him to coax or force tunes out of Patson Daka and Boubakary Soumar\u00e9, players bought amid fanfare last summer but who\u2019ve contributed little since. DHa 10) The importance of Calvert-Lewin Dominic Calvert-Lewin\u2019s status as Harry Kane\u2019s understudy looked secure in the England hierarchy 14 months ago, when he replaced the captain in the Euro 2020 quarter-final win over Ukraine. He has not played for the country since, and this week saw Brentford\u2019s in-form Ivan Toney named in Gareth Southgate\u2019s squad for England\u2019s final internationals before the World Cup. Qatar now appears a distant hope for the 25-year-old, who has been restricted to just 18 appearances for Everton since winning his last cap due to toe, thigh and knee injuries. Frank Lampard has been desperate for Calvert-Lewin\u2019s presence all season and, despite signing Neal Maupay, claimed the centre-forward\u2019s return diminished the need to add another striker in the transfer window. Goals remain a serious problem for a team without a Premier League win this season but, having resumed training during the enforced break, Calvert-Lewin should soon have opportunity to repay his manager\u2019s faith and perhaps send a late message to Southgate.

                    "body": "Across the battlefields of the Middle East, the ground is shifting. New alliances mitigate old enmities. Revised calculations of national advantage, evolving priorities and cautious diplomatic bridge-building conjure tantalising hopes of peace on multiple fronts. But change driven by fear has shallow roots. And fear, rather than faith in any wider vision, still permeates this contested landscape. The context, as ever, is a great power struggle between a newly aggressive Russia, an expansionist China, and a US determined to get back in the game. Growing security and economic alignment between Israel and the Arab states is one of the most spectacular shifts. Benny Gantz, Israel\u2019s defence minister, has confirmed the creation of a regional military alliance to deter Iran\u2019s missile and drone attacks. The US-backed pact reportedly involves the UAE, Bahrain, Jordan and Egypt, plus Qatar and Saudi Arabia, with which Israel has no formal diplomatic relations. It builds on the 2020 Abraham accords between Israel and four Arab countries, including Sudan and Morocco. Rapprochement is also fuelled by shared concern about Tehran\u2019s presumed nuclear weapons ambitions. It will gain added impetus in July when US president Joe Biden visits Israel and Saudi Arabia and comes as nuclear talks with Iran teeter on the brink of collapse. Biden\u2019s planned meeting with Mohammed bin Salman, the Saudi crown prince whom he deemed a \u201cpariah\u201d after the 2018 murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, is already attracting sharp criticism. This supposedly pragmatic act of realpolitik marks another stunning shift.  Biden will encourage normalisation of Israel-Saudi relations and seek to ease Palestinian tensions \u2013 he is due to visit the occupied West Bank. But fundamentally, the visit, his first to the Middle East as president, is intended to reassert US influence after the neglect of the Trump years. Russia\u2019s attack on Ukraine provides crucial context. Biden will press the Saudis and other producers to raise oil output to ease the global energy crisis and reduce Moscow\u2019s revenues. He remains mindful meanwhile of his other big overseas challenge: containing China, Russia\u2019s strategic ally and Iran\u2019s oil buddy. \u201cIf Biden reduces the war in Ukraine to a mere geopolitical struggle, the autocrats of the world will have cause to rejoice,\u201d warned Kenneth Roth of Human Rights Watch. \u201cThey will argue that democracies proclaim their values but then sell them for a cheaper tank of gas.\u201d The visit has big implications for Yemen and Syria, too. Ending the Yemen war, which produced the world\u2019s worst humanitarian emergency after the 2015 Saudi intervention against Iran-backed rebels, is a key Biden aim. The hope is that Salman will make permanent the current truce there. In what would be another big shift, the US may also offer economic incentives to a second pariah, Bashar al-Assad, in an attempt to counter Russian influence in Syria. They could even include an easing of sanctions to help Damascus to import Iranian oil.  That prospect links to another tantalising possibility: a last-gasp rescue of the nuclear pact with Iran. Indirect Iran-US talks in Qatar last week flopped. But Tehran, desperate for sanctions relief even as it develops its nuclear capabilities, insists agreement is still possible. Leading Israeli military figures now reportedly argue, contrary to the stance taken by the past and possible future prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu, that a bad Iran deal is better than no deal at all. And the US has an added incentive. Agreement could treble the amount of Iranian oil on global markets. Watching Biden, Vladimir Putin is waging a parallel influence campaign. Russia\u2019s president last week made his first trip abroad since the Ukraine invasion, meeting Iran\u2019s anti-western president, Ebrahim Raisi, in Turkmenistan. According to the Kremlin, Putin applauded a rapid expansion of bilateral trade since 24 February. \u201cWe have truly deep, strategic relations \u2026 and are working in such hotspots as Syria,\u201d he told Raisi. Like China, Russia has refused to condemn Iran\u2019s recent blocking of UN-run nuclear inspections. As usual, Iran\u2019s intentions appear opaque and contradictory. Alarmed by the new Arab-Israeli military alliance, it is flirting with a truly seismic geopolitical shift of its own: detente with Saudi Arabia, its great rival. Tehran said last week it was ready to resume Iraqi-mediated direct talks. While improbable at this stage, a defusing of nuclear and Iran-Saudi tensions could have huge positive implications for Tehran\u2019s ties with Europe, the US and all its Arab neighbours. If it reduced Middle East instability and discouraged Russian and Chinese encroachment, it would be doubly welcome in Washington. Yet the prospect of Iran\u2019s rehabilitation is an alarming one for Israel. It continues to view Tehran as an existential threat, particularly through its support for Hezbollah in Lebanon and Hamas in Gaza. Israel continues to assassinate regime figures and attack Iran\u2019s facilities, and recently intensified its so-called \u201cshadow war\u201d in Syria. This potentially puts it at odds with Biden\u2019s agenda. Whatever hopeful outcomes may or may not emerge as regional sands shift, it\u2019s already clear there will be plenty of losers. They include the Kurds of northern Syria, beset by an overbearing Turkish regime unchecked by Washington, and the independence fighters of Western Sahara.  Democracy campaigners who deplore Biden\u2019s Khashoggi volte-face will also point to countless other victims of serial human rights abuses by western-backed Middle East autocrats and dictators. But it\u2019s the Palestinians who stand to lose most from a partial, highly selective \u201cpeace in our time\u201d. Abandoned by Arab allies, manipulated by Iran, patronised by the US, ignored by wartime Europe, divided among themselves and preyed upon by the Israeli state, the cause of Palestinian independence has never looked bleaker. Times are changing. But Palestine\u2019s betrayal is timeless.  Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

                    "body": "Facing the two-time defending champion Tampa Bay Lightning put the Colorado Avalanche at a sizeable experience disadvantage going into the Stanley Cup final.  When the puck dropped, the Avalanche showed they could use their speed to offset Tampa Bay\u2019s players who have been here, done that. And it doesn\u2019t hurt to have a guy who also hoisted the Cup. Andr\u00e9 Burakovsky scored 1:23 into overtime to give Colorado a 4-3 victory in Game 1 on Wednesday night and put the Avs up in a series that\u2019s shaping up to be a classic. Burakovsky is one of only two Colorado players with Stanley Cup rings, and that came in handy. \u201cI\u2019ve been there, and I kind of know the situation,\u201d said Burakovsky, who also scored two big goals in Game 7 of the East final against the Lightning in 2018 when he won it all with Washington. \u201cI\u2019ve been though it, and I kind of know what to expect and the pace and what\u2019s at stake here.\u201d  The pace? Furious. The stakes? Either Tampa Bay finishing off the first NHL three-peat in almost four decades or this Colorado core\u2019s first championship after years of playoff disappointments. The Avalanche with a fast start how they can use their speed to knock even the most seasoned opponents back on their heels. Backstopped by Darcy Kuemper, the no-doubt after all choice to start in goal now that he\u2019s healthy, the penalty kill was aggressive in going a perfect 3 for 3 against the Lightning\u2019s potent power play. \u201cWe had a great forecheck and we were pretty good on clearing pucks when we had the chance,\u201d forward Artturi Lehkonen said. An early penalty kill built momentum for Colorado, which opened the scoring on captain Gabriel Landeskog\u2019s goal 40 seconds after Josh Manson\u2019s penalty expired. Manson \u2013 one of general manager Joe Sakic\u2019s expensive trade deadline pickups \u2013 more than made up for a holding the stick minor with several big hits. Lehkone, the Avalanche\u2019s other deadline acquisition, also kept up his knack for scoring key goals. He had their third goal of the first period after Valeri Nichuskin scored the second as part of a dominant performance all over the ice. \u201cHuge X-factor,\u201d coach Jared Bednar said. \u201cHe\u2019s been doing that type of thing for us for a couple years now.\u201d  Tampa Bay\u2019s latest additions also played a major role, with Nick Paul outracing Colorado defenseman Jack Johnson to a loose puck for a goal in the first that limited the damage and kept the defending champs in the game. Brandon Hagel, who has been banged up and was a question mark to play, got beaten to a loose puck by Landeskog, an uncharacteristic goal for reigning playoff MVP Andrei Vasilevskiy to give up by letting the initial shot sneak through under his left arm. Of course, the Lightning counterpunched. In another example of what has made the Lightning the NHL\u2019s best team over the past three years, they turned the tide in the second period with goals by Ondrej Palat and Mikhail Sergachev 48 seconds apart. \u201cWe\u2019re playing a really good team and they\u2019re not going to roll over and lay back,\u201d Bednar said. \u201cThey\u2019re going to have push back.\u201d So did his Avalanche, clamping down with another big kill in the third period to finish what Landeskog called a \u201cresilient win.\u201d Colorado outshot Tampa Bay 38-23, and there was no argument from the losing side about the result of the series opener between two evenly matched opponents. \u201cThere\u2019s some positive signs for us in this game,\u201d Lightning coach Jon Cooper said. \u201cBut the right team won the game, so give them credit for pulling it out.\u201d The arena was rocking from the start of warmups for the first Stanley Cup final game in the city in 2001 \u2013 also the last year the Avalanche won the Stanley Cup, with Sakic serving as captain. Fans chanted, \u201cWe want the Cup!\u201d throughout the leadup and at times during the game, which was a showcase of the high-scoring hockey that has been the standard all season. Tampa Bay\u2019s most prolific goal-scorer from each of the past two title runs was back, with center Brayden Point returning to play his first game since injuring his right leg a month ago. Colorado has a series lead despite playing without forwards Nazem Kadri (right thumb) and Andrew Cogliano (right hand), who were injured last series in a sweep of Edmonton in the Western Conference final. The Avalanche swept Nashville in the first round, as well, and dispatched rival St Louis in six before taking out Connor McDavid and the Oilers. If anything, Game 1 against the Lightning showed this series won\u2019t be easy for either team. \u201cI don\u2019t think by a country mile we gave them our best game,\u201d Cooper said. \u201cTo beat a team like that, we need to have better in us.\u201d"

                    "body": "Two unexpected figures \u2013 one a famed international, the other a journeyman goalkeeper \u2013 played the pivotal roles in helping the Los Angeles Football Club win its first Major League Soccer championship. Reserve goalkeeper John McCarthy stopped two penalty kicks as LAFC won MLS Cup 2022 by defeating the Philadelphia Union on penalties, 3-0, Saturday in front of 22,384 at the Banc of California Stadium. Both teams played to a 3-3 draw following 90 minutes of regulation and 30 of extra time. McCarthy entered the game in the second half of extra time after starting goalkeeper Maxime Crepeau received a red card. As a result of his unexpected efforts, McCarthy was named the game\u2019s most valuable player in just his third appearance this year. \u201cJohn is an excellent goalkeeper,\u201d LAFC coach Steve Cherundolo said. \u201cHe\u2019s the best number-two in the league. He could be a number-one elsewhere. He could be a number-one for us.\u201d McCarthy\u2019s heroics punctuated an emotional game featuring the dramatic and the unpredictable. \u201cFor 10, 15 minutes, it was like a Halloween movie,\u201d said LAFC forward Carlos Vela, one of two members of the original roster still with the team. \u201cThen we finished with a Hollywood (ending), like dreaming things, like something that you can\u2019t imagine can happen, does happen.\u201d Union coach Jim Curtin described that drama powerfully. \u201cI lived through the 130 minutes and I think I aged probably about five or six years,\u201d Curtin said about the combined amount of playing and added time. \u201cIt was chaotic. It was end-to-end. We were probably about two or three minutes away from lifting the MLS Cup trophy. I\u2019m gutted for our players.\u201d Making McCarthy\u2019s heroics possible was Gareth Bale, the former Tottenhan Hotspur and Real Madrid forward who will serve as Wales\u2019 captain during this month\u2019s World Cup. Bale scored the tying goal in stoppage time of the second overtime half, just four minutes after the Union took a 3-2 lead. \u201cIt\u2019s special,\u201d Bale said of the championship after two teammates doused him with champagne during the post-game press conference. \u201cThe reason why I came here was to try to help the club win a trophy and to win the MLS Cup. Obviously, they\u2019ve come close in the past but never got to the final and won it.\u201d Before this year, LAFC\u2019s biggest chance came in 2019, when the team won its first Supporters\u2019 Shield and tied a league record for most goals scored. But the Seattle Sounders beat LAFC in that year\u2019s conference final on the way to winning MLS Cup. Though Bale signed with LAFC on June 27, injuries limited him to just two goals in 12 regular season games. He had not played since Oct. 2 when he replaced Carlos Vela in the 97th minute. \u201cI\u2019m not 100% at the moment,\u201d Bale said. \u201cI haven\u2019t trained too much over the last three or four weeks. But we spoke about if I\u2019m needed for the last 20, 30 minutes, I\u2019m available.\u201d Bale\u2019s availability provided dividends in the 128th minute, when he headed Diego Palacios\u2019s left-wing cross into the net from seven yards while defender Jack Elliott tightly marked him. But four minutes earlier, Elliott appeared to give Philadelphia the championship. Kai Wagner sent a right-wing cross that hit LAFC\u2019s Ilie Sanchez in front of the goal. McCarthy deflected the ball but Elliott converted from two yards for his second goal of the game, culminating a rally from a 2-1 deficit. With the score tied, McCarthy went to work after Daniel Gazdag, the first of Philadelphia\u2019s penalty takers, launched his shot high over the crossbar. Gazdag tied for second among the league\u2019s regular-season scorers with 22 goals. Then McCarthy dived to his right to deflect Jose Martinez\u2019s shot at the left post. Next, he dived to his left to divert Wagner\u2019s attempt. \u201cI\u2019m not going to say I didn\u2019t have some type of idea,\u201d McCarthy said. \u201cLiterally, as I was sitting in the hot tub for pregame warming my body up, I watched a 9-minute clip of PK\u2019s.\u201d Denis Bouanga, Ryan Hollingshead and Sanchez converted for Los Angeles, with Sanchez\u2019s shot bouncing under diving goalkeeper Andre Blake to ensure the championship. Ironically, the 30-year-old McCarthy grew up in Philadelphia and played four seasons for the Union as a reserve before joining the United Soccer League\u2019s Tampa Bay Rowdies in 2019. McCarthy then spent the past two seasons with Inter Miami. \u201cI\u2019m a Philly kid through and through,\u201d he said. \u201cI grew up in Philly, went to grade school, high school, college. I know the people from that city. I know a lot of guys on that team, some of the fans. If we weren\u2019t in and Philly was in the final, I would for sure root for them.\u201d McCarthy replaced Crepeau in the 117th minute, when the starter received his red card. Crepeau charged off his line and slid out the penalty area to trip Philadelphia\u2019s Cory Burke on a breakaway. Both players went sprawling, and Crepeau had to leave the field on a motorized cart before being taken to the hospital. But while leaving, the Canadian international gave a \u201cthumbs up\u201d sign to the home fans. \u201cThese 911 moments as I call them are part of our game plan,\u201d Cherundolo said. \u201cWe tried to keep our larger stature players on the field for set pieces and crosses, and it worked.\u201d LAFC used Kellyn Acosta\u2019s 26-yard free kick in the 28th minute to move ahead, 1-0. After Martinez fouled Cristian Arango, Acosta\u2019s free kick ricocheted off the head of Philadelphia\u2019s Jack McGlynn, who leapt with the defensive wall. Blake, playing the expected angle, found himself out of position as the ball trickled between him and the left post. After the goal, Martinez used his jersey to hide the bottom half of his face. McGlynn started for midfielder Alejandro Bedoya, the Union\u2019s captain. Bedoya injured his hip flexor Sept. 17 against Atlanta and missed three of the ensuing five matches, including the final and the Oct. 20 playoff match against FC Cincinnati. \u201cIf you take your captain off any team in this league, you\u2019re going to get significantly weakened,\u201d Curtin said. \u201cTo have the kind of performance we did without Alejandro was pretty big.\u201d Gazdag tied the score in the 59th minute. Wagner began the scoring sequence with a left-wing corner kick that LAFC\u2019s Jesus Murillo headed away. But Philadelphia\u2019s Olivier Mbaizo secured the ball at midfield and passed to Martinez, who found an unmarked Gazdag in the penalty area. Gazdag beat his marker and converted a rising 11-yard shot that settled under the crossbar. LAFC regained a 2-1 lead in the 83rd minute. Vela\u2019s corner kick from the right wing found Murillo, whose glancing header from just outside the right side of the goalkeeper\u2019s crease settled inside the far post. But two minutes later, the visitors again tied the score. Wagner sent his 38-yard free kick from the right wing to Elliott, whose 10-yard header beat Crepeau."

                    "body": "1) A planned impromptu drinks break Although it may be coincidence, someone far more observant than this column recently noticed that Southampton appear to have devised a clever, completely legal mid-game tactic that involves one of their players going down \u201cinjured\u201d and in apparent need of medical attention between the 60th and 70th minute, at which point their teammates adjourn to the sideline to receive energy gels and tactical instruction from Ralph Hasenh\u00fcttl and his backroom team. Should it occur on Friday evening, we can but hope it won\u2019t be the most interesting talking point to arise from their match against Norwich, but it has piqued our curiosity and is the first of our now traditional 10 things to look out for this weekend. BG  Southampton v Norwich City, Friday 8pm (all times GMT)  2) Toffees still in sticky situation With Liverpool otherwise engaged at Wembley, Manchester City have a chance to reopen a six-point lead at the top. In Frank Lampard they take on a former City player; the manager\u2019s single, 2014-15 season in Manchester a forgotten coda to his long spell at Chelsea. Beating Leeds 3-0 two weeks ago lent optimism to his new Everton regime, only for last week\u2019s 2-0 defeat at Southampton to reintroduce the Goodison gloom. Leeds conceding nine goals in their next two matches further deepened it, and all four of the teams below Everton in the table have been in better form over the past five matches. That Leeds and Brentford are on more of a slide may ease some of the nerves but Everton are in their deepest relegation trouble since the 2001-02 season when David Moyes was brought in to escape the drop. In such a situation, a wounded, motivated City feel the opposite of the ideal opponents to face. JB  Everton v Manchester City, Saturday 5.30pm  3) Watford need another turning point When Watford beat Manchester United 4-1 at Vicarage Road in November to bring down the guillotine on Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r\u2019s spell in Old Trafford\u2019s managerial hotseat, they sat 16th in the league, as close to eighth-placed United as they were to the bottom three with the season nearly a third of the way through. It was a turning point in both sides\u2019 campaigns: since then only Manchester City and Liverpool have outperformed United, who have taken 29 points from 14 games, while not until last Saturday did Watford win another game, and their five points from 13 is, on a points per game basis, not far off twice as bad as Everton, the next worst-performing team in the division (0.38 v 0.63). It goes without saying that the Hornets desperately need another turning point but though Roy Hodgson has brought greater defensive organisation, he has not eliminated individual mistakes, has reduced the side\u2019s attacking ambition, and salvation looks as distant as ever. SB  Manchester United v Watford, Saturday 3pm   4) Weary resignation at Elland Road Antonio Conte and Marcelo Bielsa have both recently admitted they are struggling to justifying their large salaries and when Leeds host Tottenham on Saturday, the game is likely to be a Derby della Despair for one of them in the event of any outcome other than a draw. While Tottenham go into the game as hot favourites, only a wild optimist would bet heavily on them to prevail despite the porousness of their hosts\u2019 defence. While Bielsa\u2019s future is constantly clouded in uncertainty, Friday\u2019s press conference will reveal if his opposite number has calmed down since his very public existential crisis in the wake of midweek defeat at Burnley. As rare as the sight of elite managers falling on their swords might be, it would be massively surprising if the result of this Saturday\u2019s lunchtime game prompted one of the Premier League\u2019s two more impassioned leaders to decide the jig is up. BG  Leeds v Tottenham, Saturday 12.30pm  5) Bees crying out for saviour to lead them to safety At some point during this relegation six-pointer, Christian Eriksen is expected to make his first appearance for Brentford. Almost certainly as a substitute, he will return to top-level football eight months after he suffered his cardiac arrest during Euro 2020. And the stakes will almost immediately be sky high. Brentford are crying out for a saviour, having collected just one point from a possible 21 since beating Aston Villa on 2 January. Newcastle are heading in the opposite direction, having taken 10 from a possible 12, and on last week\u2019s visit to London had West Ham on the ropes before having to settle for a point. A win at the Community Stadium can leapfrog Eddie Howe\u2019s team over that of Thomas Frank, who hope to have Ivan Toney back leading the line. Toney, cast aside from Newcastle during Rafael Ben\u00edtez\u2019s reign, was a scorer when the teams drew 3-3 in November, Howe\u2019s first match in charge. JB  Brentford v Newcastle, Saturday 3pm  6) Villa to offer Brighton home comfort? They might be ninth but last week\u2019s defeat to Burnley was not entirely out of the blue for a Brighton side who boast only one home win in five months now. Encouragingly this weekend\u2019s opponents, Aston Villa, have lost to Newcastle and Watford in their past two games, managing only one shot on target in each fixture, which led Steven Gerrard to this intriguing analysis last week: \u201cWe\u2019ve had 19 shots but only managed one on target, so we haven\u2019t worked [Watford goalkeeper] Ben Foster anywhere near enough and that falls on my shoulders. That\u2019s on me and my staff to be more inventive and creative in the final third. We\u2019ve got talented players in there. We\u2019ve got internationals, Brazilians, Argentinians and England internationals. Players have got to want to get in the right areas and people have got to want to create and score. The result falls on me, I\u2019ll take that and I\u2019ll take the heat to protect the players but moving forward you need to be better in the final third.\u201d Which appears to translate fairly clearly as: \u201cIt\u2019s my fault we haven\u2019t been more creative. Although obviously it\u2019s the players\u2019 fault. Just to be clear, I\u2019ll take the blame for this, but it\u2019s on them.\u201d SB  Brighton v Aston Villa, Saturday 3pm  7) Will Wolves cash in at West Ham? West Ham\u2019s wobble since the turn of the year could have been more costly: they are still four points behind fourth-placed Manchester United, but their stalled form has fans grumbling. A failure to freshen up the squad in January is likely to be costly. That Michail Antonio, Tomas Soucek and Pablo Fornals have flagged is understandable given their workload in a thin squad. As well as a Champions League place \u2013 a publicly stated target from the club\u2019s ownership when they moved to the London Stadium in 2016 \u2013 it could cost them an extra year of Declan Rice. Wolves, Sunday\u2019s opponents, have refreshed their squad by cashing in assets to bring in fresh talent with an efficiency not reflected in the Hammers\u2019 tentative steps into the transfer market. And with Newcastle now also flush, the chance to top the Premier League\u2019s middle class may already have been squandered. JB  West Ham v Wolves, Sunday 2pm  8) A Burnley side set in its set-piece ways It\u2019s been a little under three years since Burnley last won back-to-back-to-back Premier League matches but Sean Dyche\u2019s men can make it three on the spin against a Crystal Palace side that have managed successive wins only once this season. That the first of those two triumphs came at Manchester City tells you all you need to know about Palace\u2019s progress under Patrick Vieira \u2013 they are a team capable of beating the best on their day but are maddeningly inconsistent and often don\u2019t get the results their performances deserve. The corresponding fixture at Turf Moor earlier this season was one such game, with Palace gifting Burnley a share of the points in an entertaining 3-3 draw through their inability to defend set pieces. It is a frailty Sean Dyche will look to exploit again, having seen his players score once and go close with at least two other headed opportunities from dead-ball situations against Tottenham. BG  Crystal Palace v Burnley, Saturday 3pm   9) Reds back on way to Wembley The time when Liverpool fans would call Wembley \u201cAnfield South\u201d lies long in the past. J\u00fcrgen Klopp has concentrated his squad\u2019s efforts on winning the Champions League and Premier League during his time in England, choosing to blood youth in the domestic cup competitions. Sunday\u2019s Carabao Cup showpiece will be only the second English cup final Klopp has presided over, the last coming in February 2016, when he had been in charge for barely four months. Liverpool lost that League Cup final to Manchester City on penalties and \u2013 of Klopp\u2019s squad that day \u2013 only Jordan Henderson, James Milner, Roberto Firmino and Divock Origi remain. The overhaul that Klopp has carried out in those six years is reflected in names such as Simon Mignolet, Nathaniel Clyne, Alberto Moreno, Mamadou Sakho, Philippe Coutinho and Emre Can, all of them decent, talented players but expendable to a manager who has transformed the club and widened their horizons. JB  Chelsea v Liverpool, Sunday 4.30pm  10) Chelsea calling for shots? Chelsea have had 20 shots on target and scored six goals in the Premier League this calendar year; Liverpool have had 19 shots on target and scored nine goals this week. While defensively the two teams have been comparable this season (Chelsea have conceded 17 goals to Liverpool\u2019s 19, and 76 shots on target to Liverpool\u2019s 72) the Reds\u2019 attack is not so much streets ahead of their opponents\u2019 as entire motorway networks more advanced. Meanwhile J\u00fcrgen Klopp said after Wednesday\u2019s thrashing of Leeds that in midfield \u201cmore often than not you need really fresh legs\u201d and has been putting those words into practice \u2013 Liverpool\u2019s two matches this week featured entirely different starting midfield threes, two of them later being substituted on each occasion. This makes it hard to guess whose legs will be freshest come Sunday but though the remainder of the team could feasibly be unchanged some kind of reshuffle here seems likely. SB "

                    "body": "  3.35pm   Closing summary  Time for a recap. The boss of Goldman Sachs has warned that there are \u2018bumpy times ahead\u2019, with the risk of recession next year as central bankers battle inflation. Speaking to Bloomberg TV, David Solomon said we face a \u2018very uncertain time\u2019, with monetary and economic conditions changing very quickly, which is slowing economic activity. Britain\u2019s construction sector had a tricky November, with new orders falling as rising borrowing costs spooked clients. The hospitality industry has warned that business will suffer as rail workers strike later this month. But German factories have reported a bounceback in new orders, despite the economic pressures from high energy prices. It could mean Germany\u2019s downturn will be shallower than feared. Here\u2019s the rest of today\u2019s main stories:               3.25pm     Ratings agency Moody\u2019s has put UK commercial landlord Canary Wharf\u2019s ratings under review for downgrade due to what it said was the worsening outlook for the real estate sector and the more difficult funding environment, Reuters reports. Moody\u2019s said it expects drops in office values that could be as high as 10-15% alongside materially increased funding costs and weaker demand for occupational space, and a challenging environment for asset disposal because of weak real estate markets.      3.14pm   WTO urges countrie to resist trade restrictions  Trade restrictions across the world economy have increased, according to a new report from the World Trade Organisation (WTO). It warns that WTO members are introducing restrictions at an increased pace, particularly on food, feed and fertilizers, in \u201ca context of economic uncertainty\u201d exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, the war in Ukraine and the food security crisis. WTO Director-General Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala is calling on WTO members to refrain from adopting new trade-restrictive measures, particularly export restrictions. She warns that such curbs could hurt the global economic outlook.  Countries should cooperate to keep markets open and predictable in order to allow goods to move around the world to where they are needed, Okonjo-Iweala argues, saying:  \u201cMembers have increasingly implemented new trade restrictions, in particular on the export side, first in the context of the pandemic and more recently in the context of the war in Ukraine and the food security crisis. Although some of these export restrictions have been lifted, many others persist. Out of the 78 export restrictive measures on food, feed, and fertilizers introduced since the start of the war in late February, 57 are still in place, covering roughly USD 56.6 billion of trade. These numbers have increased since mid-October, which should be a cause for concern.\u201d   India, for example, has just lifted a three-month long ban on rice exports, judging that it now has enough production to fulfill its domestic demand.     3.08pm   Wall Street opens lower  The New York stock market has dipped at the start of trading, as investors worry that the US Federal Reserve may raise interest rates by another 75 basis points next week. The S&amp;P 500 shares index has dropped by 0.75%, losing 30 points to trade around 3,968 points. Tech stocks are weaker, pulling the Nasdaq Composite down by 1.25%. Traders are jittery about further interest rate rises, and not convinced the Fed will achieve that \u2018soft landing\u2019 which David Solomon mentioned. Susannah Streeter, senior investment and markets analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, explains:  \u2018\u2019Worries that the Fed could unwrap an unwelcome present of another super-sized rate hike when policymakers meet next week are sprinkling Christmas fear on indices. Wall Street registered its worst day in almost a month [on Monday] after a snapshot from the services industry showed consumer resilience was strong. This has fuelled speculation that the US central bank will have to be more Scrooge-like and make borrowing even more expensive to rein in inflation. Companies still appear to be dealing with pent-up demand with the ISM reading showing the services sector is expanding merrily. With central bank policies so far having meagre impact on the jobs market, the chances of a 0.75% rate hike being announced on the 14th are now considered to be higher. The potential effect of another rapid tightening round has led to jitters about repercussions for the global economy.   Updated at 3.08pm GMT    2.47pm   Goldman CEO warns of 'bumpy times' ahead and recession risk  The boss of Goldman Sachs has warned that there are \u2018bumpy times ahead\u2019, as central bankers try to crush inflation without crashing economies. Speaking to Bloomberg TV, David Solomon said we face a \u2018very uncertain time\u2019, with monetary and economic conditions changing very quickly, which is slowing economic activity. \u201cI think you have to assume that we have some bumpy times ahead\u201d, Solomon explained, with activity levels likely to be constrained in a \u201ctougher economic environment\u201d. Goldman\u2019s economists predict global growth will slow in 2023, to 1.9% growth, Solomon explained. The big question is whether central banks can orchestrate a soft landing, as they tighten monetary policy to combat inflation, Solomon warns:  I think that\u2019s so uncertain. I think there\u2019s a possibility of that [a soft landing].  But I certainly think we could see a recession in 2023 also, so I think you\u2019ve got to be cautious and prepare.  Faced with this darkening outlook, Solomon signals that Goldman staff should expect lower compensation (ie: bonuses) this year, as 2022 was not as strong as 2021 \u2013 which was a record year for Goldman. He says:  2022 is a different year, so naturally compensation will be lower. We\u2019re still early in the process of making those decisions. But just like every year, we pay for performance and we will pay people based on the overall performance of the firm.   There\u2019s a clip here.     2.15pm    Sacha Lord, night time economy adviser for Greater Manchester, fears the UK\u2019s train strikes will have a devastating impact on the hospitality sector:       2.14pm    Here\u2019s a handy thread on today\u2019s US trade report, from Chad Moutray, chief economist at The National Association of Manufacturers:             1.53pm   Oil tankers queue up off Turkey as price cap on Russian crude begins  A traffic jam of oil tankers has grown off Turkey after the imposition of a price cap on Russian crude by western powers attempting to hurt the Kremlin\u2019s coffers. The vessels have come to a halt after Turkish authorities in Ankara demanded that insurers prove that the ships heading through its straits are fully insured. EU sanctions on Russian oil prices came into force on Monday after tense negotiations last week. The rules state that tankers carrying Russian crude oil must not carry western maritime insurance unless it is sold under the $60 ($49) a barrel G7 price cap. The cap has been introduced in an attempt to curb Russia\u2019s fossil fuel revenues while ensuring oil continues to flow and the maritime insurance industry, which is dominated by companies in London, was not damaged. Russian oil transferred via a pipeline is not covered by the cap. About 19 crude oil tankers were waiting to cross Turkish waters on Monday, stopping near the Bosphorus and Dardanelles, which link Russia\u2019s Black Sea ports with overseas markets, the Financial Times reported. It said one tanker had been waiting for six days.       1.47pm   Oil price dips  Recession fears have knocked the oil price lower today. Brent crude has fallen by 1.3% to $81.57 per barrel, towards last week\u2019s 10-month low. Susannah Streeter, senior investment and markets analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, says this week\u2019s PMI reports have shown economic activity slowing  A wider snapshot of business activity across the Eurozone showed that optimism is also low, with activity falling for a fifth month in a row in November.  It is clear that surging inflation, combined with higher interest rates, is eating into budgets. The data is a fresh indication that the Eurozone is heading into a shallow recession, but a much colder winter and high demand for oil and gas could see energy prices shoot up again, piling on more pressure for companies. For now, the oil price is being pushed lower, with a barrel of Brent Crude trading below $82, as concerns about the effect of central bank tightening on demand across the global economy take precedence over supply concerns.\u2019\u2019       1.43pm    The US trade deficit has widened to $78.2bn in October, up around $4.0bn from the $74.1bn recorded in September. US exports dropped by $1.9bn during the month, while imports rose by $2.2bn in the month. Natural gas exports dropped by $1.4bn while the value of crude oil exports jumped by $1.6bn in the month. The Commerce Department reports that:  The deficit with the European Union increased by $7.1bn to $23.1bn in October. Exports decreased $1.2bn to $28.8bn and imports increased $5.9bn to $51.9bn The surplus with Singapore decreased by $1.9bn to $0.7bn in October. Exports decreased $0.8bn to $4.0bn and imports increased $1.1bn to $3.3bn. The deficit with China decreased by $6.0bn to $26.1bn in October. Exports increased $1.4bn to $13.6bn and imports decreased $4.6bn to $39.7bn.        1.26pm   Full story: UK households will spend 10% more on Christmas dinner, research finds  Households will typically have to spend nearly 10% more on Christmas dinner this year, despite data showing growth in supermarket prices slowed for the first time in nearly two years. The figures from the market research firm Kantar shows the cost of a traditional Christmas dinner for four \u2013 including frozen turkey, carrots, cauliflower, potatoes and Christmas pudding \u2013 has risen to \u00a331 this year, up 9.3% from 2021. That is despite data showing that the rate of grocery price inflation dipped 0.1 percentage points to 14.6% over the past four weeks, thefirst time the annual growth in prices has slowed in 21 months. \u201cAs we move into the busiest time of the year for supermarkets, there are signs that the pace of grocery price inflation is easing off slightly,\u201d Fraser McKevitt, the head of retail and consumer insight at Kantar, said.      1.09pm    Asda is planning to open 300 small convenience stores and create 10,000 new jobs in the next four years as it tries to grab a bigger share of the grocery market and potentially overtake rival Sainsbury\u2019s to become the UK\u2019s second largest supermarket. The retailer, which is controlled by the billionaire Issa brothers and private equity firm TDR Capital, currently has just two Asda Express stores \u2013 in Sutton Coldfield, near Birmingham, and Tottenham Hale, in north London. It has already said it plans to have 30 by October next year and has now laid out a much bigger ambition. The 300 planned Asda Express sites will be in addition to the 132 convenience stores the group is acquiring from the Co-op.      1.08pm    The UK economy could be hit by an \u2018influx of insolvencies\u2019 in early 2023, according to Owen Bassett, retail expert and underwriter at credit insurers Atradius UK. He warns that retailers will be ht by plumetting demand in the first quarter of 2023, with a \u2018bumpy road\u2019 ahead for British retailers and hospitality businesses alike.  Bassett says:  Black Friday and the World Cup will have tempted people to loosen their purse strings, take advantage of discounts, and encouraged them into their local pubs. Retailers will need to pull out all the stops over the next few weeks to boost sales before demand plummets in January. \u201cThe first quarter of the year is usually one to watch for retail and hospitality insolvencies following the post Christmas slump. To avoid getting swept up in what could be an influx of insolvencies in early 2023, businesses will need to make sure they\u2019re effectively managing their supply chains and doing what they can to avoid holding onto excess stock. We \u2013 at Atradius \u2013 continue to underwrite retail firms on a case-by-case basis, but it\u2019s crucial that firms have robust and updated financial insight and forecasts. To guard against the domino effect that crumbling supply chains can have on firms, a trade credit insurance policy can play a very important role in maintaining a company\u2019s confidence in its trade debtor book. In a time of high volatility this could be a determining factor as to whether a company flourishes or fails.\u201d      12.47pm   FT: EC to propose sanctions on Russia\u2019s mining industry  The European commission is to propose a ban on new investments in Russia\u2019s mining sector, according to the Financial Times. The curbs would be part of a fresh package of sanctions against Moscow aimed at further eroding the country\u2019s economy and the Kremlin\u2019s ability to fund its war against Ukraine. Here\u2019s the details via the FT:  The mining investment ban, which will have exceptions for some specific products, is part of a ninth EU sanctions package that officials plan to discuss with member states in the coming days and hope to have agreed by the end of next week, three people with knowledge of the discussions told the FT. The package, which requires unanimous approval by the 27 EU states and could still be amended, also includes export controls on technologies that Brussels believes Russia is using to support its arms factories, a ban on transactions with three more Russian banks and targeted sanctions against another 180 individuals, the people said.       12.21pm    More strike news: Thousands of ambulance workers and other NHS staff are to strike on 21 December in a dispute over pay, the GMB, Unison and Unite unions announced. Our Politics liveblog has the latest developments:      12.21pm    Night time industries such as nightclubs also fear losing business due to rail strikes over the festive period. Michael Kill, CEO of the Night Time Industries Association, has warned the strike action announced by the RMT yesterday will be \u201cthe death knell\u201d for many NTE businesses. Kill says the government must provide more support for the sector:   \u201cThese businesses are suffering heavily, with thousands of bookings being cancelled and some attempting to bring bookings forward to avoid strike action, creating further chaos.\u201d \u201cIn previous strike action days, we have seen in some cases up to 40% lost in trade, with billions of pounds in revenue in the balance over the holiday period, which they are relying on to survive.\u201d \u201cIt is clear public opinion is shifting, with many angry at being unable to enjoy a traditional festive period after 3 years of disruption.\u201d \u201cThe actions of the unions and rail companies in reaching a resolution at such a critical time is unacceptable.\u201d  \u201cOur sector will not survive the current cost inflation crisis and further industrial action, and will require a Government intervention and further support for businesses at the sharpest end of this crisis.\u201d  A Yougov poll published last Friday found that trade unions are seen more negatively following 2022\u2019s summer strikes, but Britons are now more supportive of certain profession\u2019s right to strike, including train drivers and nurses.      12.10pm   Airlines warn of higher fares as industry moves to net zero target  Airline passengers face higher ticket prices as the industry moves towards its target of reducing emissions to net zero by 2050, the head of a global trade association has said today. Willie Walsh, the director general of the International Air Transport Association, which includes most of the world\u2019s big airlines, called for swifter action in Europe to drive up scarce production of greener sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). Air fares have jumped this year as a result of higher prices for conventional fossil-based jet fuel. Walsh told reporters at an annual media briefing that:  \u201cYou cannot expect an industry making on average $1 profit per customer to absorb the increases we\u2019ve seen.\u201d        11.49am    The UK housing sector has also been hit by Rishi Sunak\u2019s decision to drop compulsory housebuilding targets to see off an embarrassing rebellion by his backbench MPs. My colleague Aubrey Allegretti reported last night that:  The capitulation, which comes in the middle of a national housing crisis, will spark fresh concerns that the prime minister is too weak to take on unruly Conservative backbenchers. It followed up to 100 Tory MPs threatening to back an amendment that would in effect force the government to abolish the target of building 300,000 homes a year in England. Instead, the target will be \u201cadvisory\u201d and councils will be allowed to build fewer homes if they can show hitting it would significantly change the character of an area, an exemption expected to particularly apply to rural and suburban communities. The move was described as \u201cextremely worrying\u201d by housing campaigners but saves Sunak and the housing secretary, Michael Gove, a humiliating showdown in the Commons. They were forced to pull a vote on the levelling up and regeneration bill last month when the rebellion first came to light.        11.38am    Here\u2019s a handy guide to the Christmas dinners on offer at hospitality venues around the UK (strikes permitting), by the intrepid Rich Pelley:      11.26am   RSM: Construction industry hit by recession  The drop in the UK construction PMI to a three-month low shows that the building industry is being hit by the recession, says Kelly Boorman, partner and national head of construction at RSM UK:  \u2018Following a surprising uptick in September and October, the latest fall in the headline construction PMI for November paints a truer picture of the major disruption faced by the industry, as business confidence drops to the lowest level in two and a half years.  There has been a significant slowdown in construction activity, with higher borrowing costs adding another layer of financial pressure for businesses as they grapple with reduced demand. In addition, as an energy-intensive industry, energy prices remain a real concern, especially with the impact of inflation on the supply chain. \u2018The government has curbed spending on large infrastructure projects, which \u2013 along with house building stalling \u2013 explains why business confidence is plummeting as the recession takes hold. Commercial activity was the only index to rise slightly, although this is likely due to renegotiation of pricing and power within the supply chain, as costs to retender would be at a significant increase. This is further reflected in input buying sitting at the highest level since July, as raw material availability also improved.\u2019   Boorman adds that the UK\u2019s troubling economic outlook is certainly dampening future activity and business confidence in the sector.  With November 2022 seeing the highest number of insolvencies since February 2020, further challenges lie ahead. There\u2019s significant risk within the supply chains due to higher borrowing costs and falling cash flows, and it\u2019s likely that restructuring activity will continue to accelerate in the marketplace. Now more than ever, the industry needs government investment to help drive long-term improvement and innovation.  The CBI warned yesterday that the UK has fallen into a recession that will last until the end of 2023:      11.08am    People struggling to pay their energy bills, or mortgages or rent, are more likely to experience depression than other UK adults, new data from the Office for National Statistics shows. The ONS reports that around 1 in 4 (or 24%) of those who reported difficulty paying their energy bills experienced moderate to severe depressive symptoms, which is nearly three times higher than those who found it easy to pay their energy bills (9%). Overall, around 1 in 6 (16%) adults experienced moderate to severe depressive symptoms in the period from 29 September to 23 October, the ONS reports. That\u2019s similar to rates found in summer 2021 (17%), but however higher than pre-pandemic levels (10%). Adults who were economically inactive because of long-term sickness were more likely to experience depression (at 59%), as were unpaid carers who performed at least 35 hours of caring responsibilities each week ( at 37%), disabled adults (35%), adults in the most deprived areas of England (25%), young adults aged 16 to 29 years (28%) and women (19%). Around 1 in 4 (27%) adults who reported difficulty in affording their rent or mortgage payments had moderate to severe depressive symptoms; this is around two times higher than those who said it was easy to meet housing costs (15%).        10.54am   UK construction slowdown may lead to legal disputes  Ally MacKenzie, Construction Disputes Partner at law firm Addleshaw Goddard, predicts there will be a lot of disputes in the construction sector next year, as the economic downturn hits builders.  MacKenzie explains:  Contractors tend to operate on very slim margins so any downturn risks creating a sort of domino effect of cash-flow issues and insolvencies.  \u201cThe best thing companies can do right now is ensure that any contracts they have in place properly meet the demands of the current market, particularly in regard to rapid price fluctuations.  Contractors should also stay as close as possible to their supply chains and immediately act on any warning signs.\u201d      10.35am   UKHospitality: rail strikes will hurt our sector  Britain\u2019s hospitality sector fears it will lose out on vital Christmas takings as railway workers hold strikes this month. The RMT union has announced fresh rail strikes starting in Christmas eve, which will disrupt celebrations and travel plans over the festive weekend. RMT members will walk out from 6pm on 24 December until 27 December as the dispute over pay and conditions escalates.  UKHospitality chief executive Kate Nicholls says the industrial action will hurt hospitality firms, such as bars and restaurants, in the crucial festive season:  \u201cThese further rail strikes will be hugely damaging for hospitality businesses, their workers and their customers as it seems almost guaranteed that we will be facing a heavily disrupted Christmas for the third year in a row. \u201cOur estimate of the cost of these strikes already stood at \u00a31.5 billion in lost sales and it\u2019s incredibly frustrating that a solution has yet to be reached to avoid this disruption during the golden month of trade for our sector. \u201cWe\u2019re continuing to urge all parties involved in the negotiations to reach a solution imminently to avoid these harmful strikes.\u201d  The RMT\u2019s general secretary, Mick Lynch, has defended rail strikes across the UK over Christmas and said unions have a \u201cduty to coordinate what they do\u201d, saying the government is sending a message that pay rises will only come with worse terms for workers.      10.06am   Uk construction sector growth hit by rising borrowing costs  Growth at UK construction firms has hit a three-month low, as the surge in borrowing costs hit house-building. Data firm S&amp;P Global reports that UK construction companies experienced a renewed slowdown in business activity growth during November, due to subdued demand and reduced risk appetite among clients. A number of survey respondents noted that higher borrowing costs and worries about the economic outlook had curtailed construction activity. This pulled the S&amp;P Global / CIPS UK Construction Purchasing Managers\u2019 Index down to 50.4 in November from 53.2 in October, close to the 50-point mark which shows stagnation.  That shows the weakest performance since August. Mortgage costs surged after September\u2019s mini-budget, which scuppered some people\u2019s hopes of buying a house. The Bank of England raised interest rates to 3% at the start of November, as it tried to fight inflation. Business optimism slumped to the lowest for two and-a-half years, as builders worried that the jump in borrowing costs would hurt the sector. Employment numbers continued to increase in November, but the rate of job creation fell to its slowest since February 2021. Tim Moore, economics director at S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence, says the jump in mortgage rates led to some house-building projects being \u2018curtailed\u2019:  \u201cStalling house building activity contributed to the weakest UK construction sector performance for three months in November. Survey respondents noted that new residential building projects had been curtailed in response to rising interest rates, cancelled sales and worries about the economic outlook. \u201cConstruction growth was largely confined to the commercial segment, but even here the speed of expansion slowed considerably since October as client confidence weakened in response to heightened business uncertainty. At the same time, a lack of new work to replace completed projects resulted in another fall in civil engineering activity.   Updated at 10.13am GMT    9.49am     SSP, which operates food outlets at UK railway stations and airport, has returned to profitability thanks to the pick-up in passengers this year. The owner of the Upper Crust chain has reported a pretax profit of \u00a325.2m in the year to 30 September, up from a loss of \u00a3411m the previous year when Covid-19 restrictions hit the travel sector. It told shareholders that:  A rapid recovery in passenger demand through the year and disciplined cost management has resulted in SSP delivering a strong set of results. We remain well-positioned to benefit from the continued recovery and further growth of the global travel market over the medium-term.  Revenues jumped by 162% to \u00a32.18bn, and were 78% of 2019 levels. SSP said the recovery in passenger numbers has been led by \u201cstrong leisure travel demand over the summer holiday season\u201d, which has continued well into the autumn. The group also reported a particularly strong performance in North America, where business benefited from the sharp recovery in domestic air travel this year.     9.38am   UK Statistics Authority looking into train cancellation loophole  The UK Statistics Authority, which provides independent regulation of all official statistics produced in the UK, has said it is investigating how train cancellation statistics are reported, following a series of Guardian stories.Some train companies \u2014 with Transpennine Express (TPE) the worst offender \u2014 are taking advantage of a loophole which means that cancellations don\u2019t \u201ccount\u201d in official statistics if they are announced the night before, by 10pm. They use something called a p-code, originally designed to allow companies to cancel trains for reasons beyond the operators\u2019 control, for example after a landslide.  But the p-code is open for operators to interpret, meaning some only use it for circumstances that are not their fault, while others, such as TPE, use it when they simply don\u2019t have enough staff. This results in misleading data which only includes on-the-day cancellations.  TPE actually cancelled around 20% of services last month but will only have to report on-the-day cancellations of around 6%. Work is also underway with the Department for Transport and the Office for Rail and Road to \u201cbetter display\u201d pre-planned cancellation data.     9.24am   German factory orders rise, lifting hopes of milder recession  Over in Germany, factories have reported a larger than expected increase in orders, which may cool recession worries. German factory orders rose by 0.8% in October, driven by increased demand for heavy-duty machinery and equipment. These capital goods orders jumped 3.2% in October, despite the impact of higher energy costs hitting Europe\u2019s economy. Makers of intermediate goods saw a 1.4% drop in new orders, while demand for consumer goods was down 6.3%. Economists had forecast a smaller rise in factory orders of just 0.1%, so this indicates the downturn in Europe\u2019s largst economy could be milder than feared. Germany\u2019s economy ministry says:  \u201cIn addition to the slightly improved sentiment indicators, this is a further indication that the recession could be weaker than feared, even if the outlook for the industrial economy remains subdued,\u201d        9.04am   UK risks sleepwalking into food supply crisis, says farmers\u2019 union  The government risks \u201csleepwalking\u201d into a food supply crisis unless it provides crucial support for British farmers struggling with the soaring cost of fuel, fertiliser and feed, the National Farmers\u2019 Union has warned. Rising costs could result in supply problems for energy-intensive crops including tomatoes, cucumbers and pears \u2013 which are on track for their lowest yields since records began in 1985 \u2013 and rationing at supermarkets as recently experienced with eggs, the union said. The union said milk prices were also likely fall below the cost of production and that beef farmers were weighing whether to cut down on the number of cows being bred for slaughter in light of surging costs. Surging input costs linked to the war in Ukraine as well as the pandemic were to blame, the NFU said, having more than tripled the price of fertiliser since 2019, and pushed the cost of fuel and feed up by about 75%. That is on top of a six-fold increase in wholesale gas rices, and increased checks and red tape for importers linked to Brexit. The union is calling for state support for farmers, who it said had been forced out of business since the Covid outbreak, noting that the UK had lost about 7,000 agricultural businesses since 2019.      8.58am         8.25am   Kantar: no big World Cup effect at the supermarkets yet....  The excitement around England\u2019s performance and Wales\u2019 first World Cup showing in 64 years hasn\u2019t translated into rapid sales rises at the supermarkets, Kantar reports. Beer sales were up in November, but that\u2019s mainly due to higher prices, but sales of snacks have jumped: Kantar says:  We haven\u2019t seen a big World Cup effect \u2013 at least not yet. Take-home beer sales nudged up slightly in the last four weeks, covering the first week of the tournament, by 5% to \u00a3230 million, but mostly due to increased prices. Many people are taking the chance to enjoy a social pint while watching the games in bars and pubs, whereas last year we were in the middle of a COVID resurgence so consumers were limiting their movements and going out less. We\u2019re likely to be marking the impact of that comparison with higher at-home volumes one year ago. Crisp and snacks have fared better this winter, however, with sales up by 18%.      8.21am   The cost of a traditional Christmas dinner up 9.3%  The cost of a traditional Christmas dinner has jumped due to soaring food inflation, market research group Kantar reports. Grocery price inflation in November has dipped by 0.1 percentage points to 14.6% which is the first decline in 21 months, Kantar\u2019s latest grocery report shows. However, food inflation still remains near record highs and the cost of a traditional Christmas dinner for four has hit \u00a331 this year, with the cost of turkey and vegetables having climbed.  Sales of mince pies and Christmas puddings are down year on year based on the number of people buying them and the overall number of purchases made, Kantar reports, suggesting the cost of living squeeze is hitting festive spending. The surge in food inflation means shoppers will have to spend an extra \u00a360 in December to buy the same items as last year. December is set to be a record-breaking month for supermarkets, with sales expected to exceed \u00a312bn mark for the first time. Discount supermarkets have seen another jump in sales over the last month, Kantar reports:  Lidl has achieved a new record market share of 7.4% while Aldi remains the fastest growing retailer with sales up 24.4%.  Fraser McKevitt, head of retail and consumer insight at Kantar, says Friday 23 December is likely to be the busiest day for pre-Christmas shopping. McKevitt adds:  Sales of mince pies, Christmas puddings and Christmas confectionery are worth 2% more than last year, but this rise can largely be put down to higher prices. If we look at the amount of people buying these items and the overall number of purchases made, then sales are actually down on 2021.   Updated at 9.13am GMT    7.56am   Introduction: World Cup boost for Marston's  Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the financial markets and the world economy. The World Cup has lifted beer sales at pub chain Marston\u2019s, as England and Wales fans flocked to the bar to drink in the action from Qatar. Marston\u2019s has told shareholders that the World Cup has benefited trading, with like-for-like drink sales up around 50% for England\u2019s first two World Cup games (against Iran and the US). Marston\u2019s also reports that current trading to the end of November has been \u201cpositive with encouraging levels of Christmas bookings\u201d, in the first festive season without Covid restrictions since 2019. In its latest full-year financial results, Marston\u2019s reports that like-for-like sales were 99% of its 2019 levels despite disrupted trading last Christmas due to the Omicron variant. Revenues rose to almost \u00a3800m in the year to 1 October, up from \u00a3401.7m the previous year, towards its target of a billion pounds. Pretax profits rose to \u00a3163.4m, up from a loss of \u00a3171.1m a year earlier. Andrew Andrea, Marston\u2019s CEO says the company had a a strong performance over the last 12 months.  Demand for our predominantly community-based pubs continues to be encouraging despite ongoing macro uncertainty and our estate is well-placed to benefit from changing patterns in consumer behaviour. We are managing cost inflation well and remain confident that our commitment to continue to reduce the Group\u2019s debt and return sales to back to \u00a31 billion will drive NAV [net asset value]and shareholder value.   While pub chains are getting a boost from the football, UK retailers have seen a surge in sales of \u2018winter warmers\u2019, such as coats, hot water bottles, and hooded blankets to help them through the cold weather. In its latest snapshot of high street and online spending, the British Retail Consortium (BRC) said sales growth picked up last month compared with October, lifted by higher prices due to inflation. Retail sales were 4.1% higher in November than a year ago, up from 1.2% in October, although that masks a much larger drop in volumes once inflation is accounted for. Victoria Scholar, head of investment at interactive investor, tells us:  Discounts around Black Friday encouraged shoppers to do their Christmas shopping early in November to make the most of the sales. With the cost-of-living crisis and squeezed household budgets, customers are arguably hungrier than ever for a bargain while retailers have been aggressively discounting in an attempt to attract a slice of the slimmed down pot of overall consumer spending. Despite November\u2019s jump, sales are still falling short of inflation with volumes lower versus last year as the macroeconomic pressures from a looming recession and rising prices continue to weigh on demand. As we approach the most important few weeks of the calendar for retail, it looks like it could be a slimmed down festive season this year for many.\u201d   The agenda  7am GMT: German factory orders for October 8am GMT: UK grocery inflation report from Kantar 8.30am GMT: Eurozone construction sector PMI report for November 9.30am GMT: UK construction sector PMI for November 1.30pm GMT: US trade report for October   "

By spectacularly avoiding relegation, they achieved that rare thing in the Premier League era: a memorable campaign, one for the ages to go alongside the time they avoided relegation in 1998, and the time they avoided relegation in 1994, and the year they finished proudly above Rafael Beneath-Us who then won Big Cup a couple of weeks later. But the best players set their sights even higher than these lofty goals, which explains why Richarlison wants out, up and away. He\u2019s leaving to pursue tangible reward and glory with [Fiver pauses, adjusts pince-nez] yep, it says Spurs, right enough. Whether Tottenham Hotspur is the ideal destination in the Brazilian\u2019s quest for success and silverware is a moot point, given they\u2019ve been waiting even longer than the Ev (and Forest, Derby and Ipswich) for the title. But they are playing in Big Cup next season, have just signed Yves Bissouma, are managed by Antonio Conte, are not managed by Frank Lampard, and haven\u2019t posted losses of \u00a3372m in the last three years. So it\u2019s all relative. An upgrade\u2019s an upgrade\u2019s an upgrade, ain\u2019t that the truth.  Everton are desperate to get the deal done by close of play on Thursday, in the hope of including the \u00a350m fee in this year\u2019s column of their tattered old account book, as they seek to comply with the Premier League\u2019s seemingly arbitrary profit and sustainability rules. Spurs had offered Harry Winks and Steven Bergwijn in part exchange, but Everton wanted the chance to waste the money themselves. And so Richarlison leaves Goodison on good terms, having scored 53 goals in 152 appearances, six of them at crucial points during the recent relegation battle. Not a bad return for the \u00a350m they paid Watford. No silverware, of course, and no profit on the deal, but the way things have been going for Everton lately, this counts as a rare success.

                    "body": "Australia would benefit from a lifting of China\u2019s ban on its coal but any gains would likely be modest as miners have largely redirected supplies elsewhere, analysts said. Shares of ASX-listed coalminers shot up on Wednesday after reports China was considering lifting its restrictions on coal imports from Australia from April. The ban was imposed in mid-2020 amid deteriorating bilateral relations that have since begun to improve.  Investors pared back their expectations of a significant boon for exporters on Thursday. Whitehaven Coal shares ended the day down 1.5%, while New Hope fell 0.7% and Yancoal closed flat. The overall market rose 0.6%. The Albanese government said the resumption of normal trade across the board between Australia and China was \u201cin both countries\u2019 best interests\u201d. \u201cThe Australian coal industry has been successful in finding alternative markets,\u201d a spokesperson for the resource minister, Madeleine King, said.  China-Australia relations have warmed since the change of the federal government in May, with the foreign minister, Penny Wong, last month making the first visit to Beijing by an Australian minister in three years. China has its own motivation to resume coal imports after a severe drought reduced hydropower last year, resulting in a depletion of stockpiles of the fossil fuel. Beijing\u2019s imposition of restrictions on commodity imports from Australia \u2013 such as coal, wine and barley, but not iron ore \u2013 resulted in exporters finding alternative markets.  Sign up for a weekly email featuring our best reads  The chief executive of the Queensland Resources Council, Ian Macfarlane, said the industry would welcome any easing of restrictions and would be keen to tap any revived export opportunities.  \u201c[I]t is worth noting that increased exports to other countries, particularly India and [elsewhere] in Asia, over the last two years have seen long-term relationships built with these countries,\u201d Macfarlane said. \u201cThese alternative markets to China are now seen by Queensland coal exporters as stable, long-term customers for Queensland coal.\u201d The chief economist at Betashares, David Bassanese, said China may be reconsidering its ban on Australian coal because of ongoing uncertainty about global supplies given the war in Ukraine and resulting sanctions on energy exporter Russia. Since banning coal from Australia, China has had to source supplies from more distant sources or increase its reliance of lower-quality coal from Chinese mines. A resumption of coal imports from Australia \u201cshould help our coal export prices to a degree, as the price premium for better quality coal that Australian tends to produce is enhanced\u201d, Bassanese said.  According to the government\u2019s latest quarterly report on resources and energy exports, shipments of metallurgical coal used in steelmaking should rise from 164m tonnes in 2021-22 to 163m tonnes by 2023-24. Soaring prices meant export revenues for the material tripled in 2021-22 to $68b. Thermal coal, burned mostly in power stations, has been more disrupted by the sanctions on Russia, with global supply chains \u201cnow longer and less efficient than they were in 2019\u201d, the report said.  \u201cHigh grade thermal coal (mostly originating from Australia and Russia) has been particularly affected by longer freight distances, and the price premium for high grade coal grew notably larger in 2022,\u201d it said. Thermal coal prices are likely to slide from historic highs of US$360 (A$523) a tonne in 2020 to about US$200/t (A$293) by 2024, the government report said.  The increasing difficult to obtain finance and insurance for coal \u2013 particularly as investors shy away from fossil fuels \u2013 means the sector could be in \u201ca permanent higher price phase\u201d, it said. \u201cThis is expected to reduce its competitiveness relative to other energy sources over the longer term.\u201d Australia exported $13.7bn worth of coal to China in 2019, almost $10bn of which was metallurgical coal. Analysis by data firm EnergyQuest has found Australia\u2019s exports of liquefied natural gas (LNG) were unchanged in 2022. Higher prices meant revenues jumped 86% in the year to about $92.8bn. \u201cThe huge growth in export revenue in 2022 is set to drive strong growth in taxation and royalties paid by Australian LNG projects, as well as helping pay for Australia\u2019s imports,\u201d EnergyQuest\u2019s chief executive, Graeme Bethune, said. The exports placed Australia among the top three LNG exporters, with Qatar and the US. LNG exports from Western Australia and the Northern Territory were up 2.1%, while those from Queensland \u2013 which make up slightly less than a third of the total \u2013 fell 3.3%, EnergyQuest said."

                    "body": "Good morning. You\u2019ve probably had enough of the febrile politics of Westminster for a bit, so may I present you with: the intractable politics of Northern Ireland. Because of its objections to the Northern Ireland protocol \u2013 the arrangements governing post-Brexit trade \u2013 the Democratic Unionist party has refused to take up its place since elections in May, and the deadline for doing so is tomorrow. Barring a sudden breakthrough in talks, a new election now looks almost inevitable \u2013 but the likelihood is that it won\u2019t solve anything. Some of the reaction to Rishi Sunak\u2019s arrival in Downing Street has been to claim that the era of Brexit defining politics is over; not in Belfast, it isn\u2019t. As the slow-motion protocol crisis likely enters a new phase, today\u2019s newsletter \u2013 with the Guardian\u2019s Ireland correspondent, Rory Carroll \u2013 will explain why. Here are the headlines \u2013 and scroll down for a brief dispatch from our occasional new feature, Extremely Online. Five big stories  Politics | Rishi Sunak has dismantled what was left of Liz Truss\u2019s legacy on his first full day as prime minister, abandoning fracking and refusing to guarantee the pensions triple lock or a defence spending rise. Sunak also delayed the autumn statement for a further fortnight. Suella Braverman | Rishi Sunak\u2019s decision to reappoint Suella Braverman six days after she was forced to resign for a security breach is facing fresh questions after a former Conservative minister claimed the home secretary was responsible for \u201cmultiple breaches of the ministerial code\u201d. Climate crisis | Current pledges to cut greenhouse gas emissions will lead to global heating of 2.5C, a level that would condemn the world to catastrophic climate breakdown, the UN has warned. Most countries have not updated their emissions plans as agreed at the Cop26 summit last year. Ukraine | Kyiv is advising refugees abroad not to return until spring amid fears over whether the country\u2019s damaged energy infrastructure can cope with demand this winter. The plea comes as officials warned that the coming winter may herald the heaviest fighting of the war. Education | Schools are being warned not to penalise or exclude pupils for wearing their hair in natural afro styles, as well as braids, cornrows and plaits, in new guidance intended to prevent hair discrimination.  In depth: \u2018There\u2019s a real sense of malaise in Northern Ireland\u2019  There\u2019s nothing new about political dysfunction at Stormont, Rory Carroll points out: \u201cIt\u2019s been one crisis after another. The assembly hasn\u2019t functioned for four of the last six years.\u201d A period of relatively routine operation since 2020 ended with assembly elections in May this year, when Sinn F\u00e9in became the largest party for the first time.  The DUP, led by Sir Jeffrey Donaldson (above), promptly escalated its campaign against the Northern Ireland protocol by pulling out of the powersharing agreement, leaving the assembly paralysed. (Sinn F\u00e9in thinks it may have been equally motivated by the desire to stop the installation of a Republican first minister for the first time.) Talks yesterday got nowhere. The deadline for powersharing to resume is tomorrow \u2013 and the secretary of state for Northern Ireland, Chris Heaton-Harris (kept in his job by Rishi Sunak), has said he will call an election at \u201cone minute past midnight\u201d if it doesn\u2019t happen. \u201cIt adds to a real sense of malaise in Northern Ireland,\u201d Rory said, \u201cbecause nobody sees a solution coming out of it. And the continued inability to make it work, for years, has raised this big question mark over the viability of the institutions of the Good Friday agreement, and whether they\u2019re fit for purpose.\u201d Here\u2019s what else you need to know. *** What\u2019s happening today? The assembly will, in fact, meet at noon, after Sinn F\u00e9in launched a recall petition to debate the cost of living crisis and won the support of the centrist Alliance party \u2013 but the DUP will use its veto to block the election of a speaker, stopping formal proceedings. \u201cIt\u2019s a stunt, really, though they would say that the DUP\u2019s refusal to sit is also a stunt,\u201d Rory said. \u201cNothing has changed in the circumstances.\u201d *** Why is the DUP blocking Stormont? As leverage in its campaign to force the British government to meet its demands on the Northern Ireland protocol, which it says must be reformed so that there is no trade border in the Irish Sea. Earlier this month, Donaldson told his party\u2019s conference that \u201ceither the prime minister delivers the provisions of the protocol bill by legislation or by negotiation and ensures that our place in the United Kingdom is restored \u2026 or there will be no basis to re-enter Stormont\u201d. The British government (this one, and the last one, and the one before that) would like the DUP to take the progress of the protocol bill, which is in the House of Lords and would allow the UK to unilaterally tear up the agreement covering Northern Ireland, as sufficient reason to restart powersharing. But the DUP says it has to be in law, and potentially in use, to be worth anything. *** Is there any prospect of powersharing being restored? \u201cI think the chances of that are negligible,\u201d Rory said. \u201cThere is just a tiny chance that Heaton-Harris will look for some kind of fudge \u2013 there have been deadlines in the past which were legally binding, and a way has been found to kick the can down the road a bit. But he\u2019s been so vocal and specific, with that \u2018one minute past midnight\u2019 line, that his credibility will take a hit if he doesn\u2019t stick to it.\u201d The trouble with the prospect of an election is that it doesn\u2019t carry much of a sense of threat for the DUP, which would probably still finish second to Sinn F\u00e9in but do no worse than last time around: in other words, as political commentator Alex Kane wrote for the Irish Times this week: \u201cIt will have confirmed the mandate it has for its continuing boycott and keeping its veto.\u201d \u201cTheir position has been quite popular with their supporters,\u201d Rory said. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say they want an election, but they aren\u2019t worried about it. Their biggest electoral worry is even flintier, less compromising unionists like Traditional Unionist Voice \u2013 so their calculation is that going \u2018soft\u2019 on the protocol is what would present a risk to their position.\u201d (For more on Traditional Unionist Voice, see this piece of Rory\u2019s from May.) Sinn F\u00e9in \u201cseems equally confident it would match or exceed its previous result\u201d because nationalists would want to keep the DUP in second place, Rory wrote yesterday. The losers in such an outcome would be more moderate parties like the Ulster Unionists (UUP) and the Social Democratic and Labour party (SDLP). *** What impact does all of this have on people in Northern Ireland? Stormont\u2019s paralysis does not stop the basic functions of the state in the region, Rory notes: \u201cCivil servants still do their jobs, the money from London still flows and is still spent. But there are impacts. There are pools of money to help with the cost of living crisis that are not being spent because of the boycott \u2013 there is a dispute over how much, but Sinn F\u00e9in claims it\u2019s \u00a3300m.\u201d Meanwhile, business leaders say that the paralysis is discouraging investment in the region. And there is some dismay that MLAs continue to be paid in full \u2013 though they continue to carry out their non-parliamentary duties. *** What happens next? An election would likely be held in December. There is also a question over whether continued paralysis will lead to \u201cdirect rule\u201d from Westminster as in the past: yesterday, Irish Taoiseach Miche\u00e1l Martin said that if no agreement is reached, Dublin will \u201cfully pursue its consultative role under the Good Friday Agreement\u201d and take a joint role in administering Northern Ireland. Unionists have said that they would refuse to accept that arrangement. If an election does maintain the current balance between the parties as expected, the DUP will presumably reiterate its demands for the Northern Ireland protocol bill to become law before any movement. That is likely to take time, Alex Kane points out: if the House of Lords makes changes to the bill that are not acceptable to the DUP, Sunak would have to force it through in its original form using the Parliament Act, which can\u2019t happen until next June. The question in the meantime is whether the UK and EU manage to strike a compromise. \u201cThen it\u2019s about whether the DUP will try to sell it as a success, as something they can work with and accept,\u201d said Rory. \u201cThe suspicion is that Donaldson is a pragmatist at heart \u2013 but he\u2019s been painted into a corner by his base.\u201d That would not appear to be in the DUP\u2019s interests in the long-term either. \u201cThey can see that all of this is fraying the union, and the longer it goes on the more that will be the effect,\u201d Rory said. In that, at least, they have something in common with every other player in the saga, and in particular the Northern Irish public: a desire for it to be over.  \u201cEverybody wants a deal to put this to bed,\u201d Rory said. \u201cThere is huge fatigue. They\u2019ve seen this movie too many times. It\u2019s normalised, but it\u2019s abnormal, it\u2019s exhausting. But there are still enough people who are willing to back Sinn F\u00e9in and the DUP.\u201d Extremely online  Ahead of Friday\u2019s deadline for Elon Musk to take over Twitter, users suspect that the social media site is about to lose whatever remains of its former lustre. Overnight, the US journalist Ben Collins started this thread inviting people to join in some collective nostalgia, writing: \u201cOkay everybody it\u2019s Zero Hour for this website, post your favorite tweets and give them a little kiss goodbye.\u201d The above tweet, included in the replies, remains a classic example of Twitter actually being funny (and how it, and the internet, went wrong somewhere along the line).

                    "body": "It is difficult to describe the uniqueness of the Breeders\u2019 Cup to anyone who has not experienced it first hand. European racegoers are lucky to see the horses for five minutes in the parade ring before a race. At the Cup, all but a few of the runners in the 14 Grade One event exercise on the track each morning of the week before the meet, decked out in their big-race saddle cloths for easy identification and under the watchful gaze of \u2026 well, anyone and everyone who is minded to turn up.\nEvery horse with the famous purple saddle cloth is an elite racehorse, one of a tiny handful from the six-figure global foal crop good enough to run at the Cup, and there are around 200 stabled at Keeneland in Kentucky this week. But there is still an irresistible buzz that sweeps around the track when a real monster of the dirt heads out to breeze in the early light, and the excitement will have been at fever pitch this week as Flightline prepares to defend his unbeaten record in Saturday\u2019s Breeders\u2019 Cup Classic.\n\nCigar, the dual winner Tiznow, Zenyatta and American Pharoah are among the outstanding champions - with a presence to match - that have lived up to their advance billing over the last 30 years, and Flightline is long odds-on to emulate them this weekend. And, perhaps, to overtake them too on the Breeders\u2019 Cup\u2019s 39-year-old honour roll of all-time greats.\nThe relative merits of champions past and present will always be a source of fierce and unavailing debate among fans, but Flightline\u2019s official rating of 139 after his astounding performance in the Pacific Classic at Del Mar in September already suggests that he is the best dirt runner of the recent decades. Flavien Prat, his jockey, was easing off for much of the final furlong but he still beat Country Grammer \u2013 the Dubai World Cup winner back in March \u2013 by 19\u00bc lengths.\nIt was as remarkable as any performance by a dirt horse since Secretariat\u2019s 31-length destruction of his field in the 1973 Belmont Stakes. For nearly half a century, the style and the detail of \u201cBig Red\u2019s\u201d Belmont has also been the big stick with which pretenders to his greatness have been soundly beaten. He covered the mile-and-a-half at very close to sprinting pace from the off, hit the quarter-pole in a faster time than he had when winning the Kentucky Derby five weeks earlier, and eventually stopped the clock in 2min 24sec. Along with his winning times in the Derby and Preakness Stakes, the other two events in the US Triple Crown, it remains a record to this day.\nAn injury shortly after arriving at John Sadler\u2019s barn as a juvenile robbed Flightline of the chance to emulate Secretariat\u2019s achievements as a three-year-old, and he did not see a track until 24 April 2021, a week before the best of his contemporaries went to post for the Kentucky Derby.\nFlightline\u2019s owners, including the California-based brothers Kosta and Pete Hronis who have a 37.5% share, would have been dreaming of a run at Churchill Downs when they paid $1m for the son of Tapit at the Fasig-Tipton yearling sale in 2019. But they knew they had a good horse on their hands, and he started favourite before finishing 13 lengths clear of his six rivals. \u201cHe just floats over the ground,\u201d Hronis texted the veteran US turf writer Steve Haskin afterwards.\n\u201cWe knew early on that he was something special that no-one had ever seen before.\u201d Four-and-a-half months later, Flightline won another minor event by 13 lengths, and then stepped straight up to Grade One company in the Malibu Stakes at Santa Anita on 26 December. He won that by 11\u00bd, then waltzed through his four-year-old debut in a Grade One at Belmont by six before heading off to his \u2013 so far \u2013 career-defining run in the Pacific Classic.\nIt has been a meteoric ascent through the ranks, a concentrated burst of brilliance that sees Flightline already sitting just 1lb behind Frankel\u2019s mark of 140 at the end of a 14-race career, with an opportunity to push on Sir Henry Cecil\u2019s great, unbeaten champion on Saturday.\nEuropean fans will point out, quite fairly, that Frankel posted several 140-worthy performances over the course of his career, while Flightline could well retire to stud with just six starts in the book after Saturday\u2019s Classic. There will, inevitably, be a sense of unfinished business should he do so.\n\nBut before there can be any debate about a five-year-old career, Flightline needs to confirm his supernatural brilliance on American racing\u2019s grandest stage. His draw in stall four is ideal but the opposition is far stronger than any field he has faced to date. Epicenter, who confirmed himself the best three-year-old around with a decisive win in the Travers Stakes in August, is a clear second-favourite, while Life Is Good, last year\u2019s Dirt Mile winner at Del Mar, is another new and high-class opponent for the odds-on favourite.\nBoth of Flightline\u2019s most obvious rivals are well-travelled and experienced, while the favourite has made only one start outside California and could find an autumnal Kentucky is a different, potentially unsettling experience.\nRepeated viewing of his Pacific Classic victory, though, takes none of the shine off the excitement. He already looks like a horse for the ages and the Classic could prove it beyond all doubt.\n\nSilver Knott best of raiders on Breeders\u2019 Cup day one\nRunners trained in Europe still head the market for all three of the turf events on Future Stars Friday at the Breeders\u2019 Cup in Kentucky but the draw has not been kind to either The Platinum Queen, in the Juvenile Turf Sprint, or Meditate, clear favourite for the Juvenile Fillies\u2019 Turf, which leaves Silver Knott (9.40) as the likeliest winner for the visitors in the Juvenile Turf.\nCharlie Appleby won this race for the third time in nine seasons last year with Modern Games and Silver Knott arrives with a similarly progressive profile.\nThere is no standout contender among the locally-trained runners and Major Dude, the best of them on ratings, has an outside draw so Aidan O\u2019Brien\u2019s Victoria Road may be able to complete a 1-2 for the Europeans in a race they have won eight times in 13 runnings.\nDown Royal 1.30 Saylavee is Willie Mullins\u2019s second-string on jockey bookings but Danny Mullins is no stranger to that and she is over-priced at 5-1 to follow up her impressive hurdling debut in September.\nExeter 1.50 He is now 20lb higher than for the first success in his current three-race winning streak but The Height Of Fame has been posting some decent times along the way and could have scope for at least one more victory.\nDown Royal 2.05 Little to choose on the ratings between stable-companions Pied Piper and Fil Dor, but the former\u2019s race fitness may tip the balance after an impressive return at Cheltenham last month.\nExeter 2.25 His two opponent have experience over fences on their side but top-class staying hurdler Thyme Hill has always looked like a chaser in waiting and is hard to oppose on his debut over the bigger obstacles.\nDown Royal 2.40 Gladiatorial is prone to the odd mistake but his jumping was mainly sound at Kelso last time and he has an obvious chance on that form.\n\nExeter 3.00 Joe Tizzard has his string in excellent form, with five wins from his last 10 runners, and Killer Kane remains fairly weighted on his form in the spring.\nExeter 3.35 Harry Cobden, understandably, is on the Grade One-winning Greaneteen but his stable companion Dolos, an 8-1 shot, gets 20lb from the top weight and finished a close second in this race three years ago off a 9lb higher mark.\nKeeneland 7.00 Richard Fahey\u2019s The Platinum Queen tops the ratings and the betting but Hollie Doyle will need to draw on all of her considerable talents to win from stall 12 and Love Reigns, fourth home in the Queen Mary at Royal Ascot, makes much more appeal at the prices to give Wesley Ward a fourth straight win in this race.\n\nKeeneland 7.40 A slow start left Chop Chop in a hopeless position in the Grade One Alcibiades Stakes over track and trip last time, but she charged through the field from three out to go down by a nose behind Wonder Wheel and can reverse the form here.\nKeeneland 8.20 Meditate is the clear pick on form but stall 10 is a major concern while Delight, the second-favourite, has fared little better in nine so the improving Spirit Gal, a comfortable winner at Dundalk last time, could be worth chancing at double-figure odds.\nKeeneland 9.00 Cave Rock is a dual Grade One winner already and is impossible to oppose in his attempt to give Bob Baffert a record-breaking sixth win in the Juvenile."

                    "body": "The view in Old Trafford on Wednesday afternoon was far more subdued than expected after the Glazer family quietly announced plans to sell Manchester United after 17 years of ownership late on Tuesday. The disparaging banners and burning effigies of Malcolm Glazer of past protests were nowhere to be seen. In fact, the grounds were almost empty. Those who did speak to the Guardian, however, were scathing about the outgoing owners. \u201cGood riddance, I think every Manchester United fan will say,\u201d says Babak Tabrizi, 64, the manager of United Cafe. \u201cThey\u2019ve never really invested any money into United but they\u2019ve taken lots of money out of the club.\u201d  The Glazers bought the club for \u00a3790m in 2005 through a leveraged buyout, meaning borrowed money is used to finance the acquisition of a company. Prior to its purchase, Manchester United had no debt. By September 2022, the club had a net debt of \u00a3514.9m. In the same year, \u00a333.6m of shareholder dividends were paid out. Daniel Gooch, 30, said the Glazers had \u201cruined the club\u201d. \u201cThey take the dividends. They\u2019ve done nothing else.\u201d Tabriri added: \u201cIn recent years, the stadium has been neglected. To be fair they\u2019ve always spent money on players but really the investment that\u2019s needed hasn\u2019t been there.\u201d Hours before the Glazers\u2019 announcement, Cristiano Ronaldo left the club after an incendiary interview with Piers Morgan in which he criticised the lack of investment by the club\u2019s owners. \u201cNothing changed since I left [in 2009]\u201d, he said. \u201cThe pool, the Jacuzzi, even the gym, even some technology,\u201d he said. \u201cI thought I would see new technology, infrastructure. I saw things I saw when I was 20.\u201d It has been 17 years since the Glazers\u2019 takeover prompted a breakaway group of Manchester United fans to set up a new supporter-owned club, FC United of Manchester, prompting scorn from Sir Alex Ferguson and others. There was little sense of glee from FC United figures on Wednesday about the potentially imminent departure of the American multimillionaires, despite being largely vindicated for abandoning Old Trafford in 2005. Natalie Atkinson, FC United\u2019s chief executive, said the Glazers\u2019 ownership had been an \u201cunmitigated disaster\u201d for Manchester United and their exit would be \u201ccautiously celebrated\u201d by some. However, she said many would be worried about being taken over by a state autocrat such as Qatar. Any sale would not change the \u201cdeep-rooted issues in modern football, where supporters are regularly treated with disdain\u201d, she added. Nick Duckett, an FC United co-founder and chair of its London branch, said he had completely lost interest in professional football since he severed his family\u2019s 100-year ties to Old Trafford back in 2005. \u201cI can\u2019t go back there and worse than that, I don\u2019t want to go back.\u201d Duckett, 67, said he would not be celebrating any selling of the club: \u201cMan United now is about making money and whoever takes it over will probably make more money than the Glazers did.\u201d Matt Farnworth, an FC United member and former chair of its youth branch, said the Glazers had \u201ctaken the club back 10 years\u201d and their failure was \u201cin one sense\u201d a vindication of the fans who had set up the rebel club. Farnworth, 30, said \u201cit still hurts\u201d to think \u201cwhat if\u201d the Glazers had not taken over United and it had remained one of Europe\u2019s premier clubs. As for who could take over, the success of the city\u2019s other team has not gone unnoticed. \u201cOil money. Someone who would go: \u2018I want this player, here you go, go on and buy him,\u2019\u201d said Graham Murdoch, 29, a fan visiting from Glasgow. Tabrizi said: \u201cIf a Gulf country with loads of money \u2013 [as happened at] City, PSG or Newcastle \u2013 buys the club, they might invest more money. The area around City has been completely regenerated. It would be good if something like this happened here. \u201cUltimately, it all depends on if they actually believe in Manchester United.\u201d"

We\u2019ll be here, there and everywhere over the weekend, starting with a live MBM from the King Power where Leicester take on champions Manchester City (12.30pm kick-off). Routine away win? Tomorrow never knows.\n\n\n\n 5.22pm  \n\nWolves caretaker boss Steve Davis admits that five defeats in the last six Premier League games have knocked his team\u2019s morale, especially the 4-0 home defeat to Leicester last weekend that left the Molineux side second from bottom. \n\u201cResults have definitely affected the players, they were very reflective after the game and we are putting huge demands on everyone because we all want to do better,\u201d said Davis ahead of Saturday\u2019s trip to Brentford.\n\u201cI haven\u2019t seen a lack of effort or commitment, everyone is pulling together and working hard to turn it around. When you look at the table, back-to-back wins can make such a difference. We know how hard it is to get points in this division but we know if we can get something tomorrow things can change very quickly.\u201d\n\n\n\n 5.13pm  \n\nErm, 16th time lucky for David Moyes?\nOpta stat: Moyes has never won away against Manchester United in the Premier League, drawing four and losing 11 of his 15 visits. His sides have scored just 10 goals across these 15 visits, with 40% of those coming in a single 4-4 draw with Everton in April 2012.\nOn the plus side, he could have Jarrod Bowen back in the squad for Sunday\u2019s trip after the forward missed Thursday night\u2019s Europa Conference League win over Silkeborg with an ankle injury.\n\u201cHe\u2019s done a little bit of running on the grass today, so we will need to see how he is,\u201d said Moyes. \u201cWe will need to see if he can do many things, see if he can twist and turn and all of the other parts that come with it.\u201d\nMeanwhile, PA Media report that West Ham have been fined 20,000 by the Football Association following the 1-1 draw at Southampton earlier this month. The Hammers\u2019 players were incensed as they felt referee Peter Bankes had impeded Bowen in the build-up to Romain Perraud\u2019s goal for Saints.\n\n\n\n 5.04pm  \n\nBrentford boss Thomas Frank insists he and his team were quick to shake off last week\u2019s humbling 4-0 loss at Aston Villa.\nThe Bees will look to bounce back when hosting Wolves on Saturday afternoon.\n\u201cIt was a tough 24 hours,\u201d admitted Frank. \u201cIt was something I had never experienced in my career, even as an under-8\u2019s coach, being 3-0 down after 12 minutes. But it\u2019s football, it happens, I know this group of players are a remarkable bunch of guys mentally and they are committed to bouncing back against Wolves.\n\u201cI do my very best to be consistent. Winning 4-0 at home to Manchester United or losing 4-0 at Aston Villa, we need to be consistent in the way we do things. We evaluated it, we looked back at the game, which was very quick, the three goals and the fourth goal, boom! That\u2019s it.\n\u201cI truly believe we win, or we learn, and last time we definitely learned a lot. Sometimes the learning can be very painful but we will come back from it, no doubt.\u201d\n\n\n\n 4.54pm  \n\nReady for The Fiver? Antony takes centre stage. Chance for a clever Shakespeare link. Nah, we\u2019ll go with this\u2026\n\nComin\u2019 atcha!\n\n\nUpdated at 4.58pm BST\n\n\n 4.43pm  \n\nSome surprising symmetry\u2026\nLeicester\u2019s home record: Points 8, Scored 9, Conceded 5Man City\u2019s away record: Points 8, Scored 9, Conceded 5\nAfter shipping goals left, right, top corner, bottom corner and centre, Leicester are on a run of three straight clean sheets and have moved out of the bottom three.\nDefender Timothy Castagne has been speaking to the club\u2019s website ahead of Saturday\u2019s 12.30pm kick-off against Pep Guardiola\u2019s men: \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a very tough game, but we\u2019re going in with nothing to lose to be honest. They\u2019re the team to beat. We\u2019re just going to play and we\u2019ll see what happens, but it\u2019ll be a very interesting game.\n\u201cWe can also have some different tactics, different plans, that can hurt a different style of team. That\u2019s good and we have a lot of quality at the front where we can score. Even when we\u2019re not in a good game, we can turn around and score two goals in 10 minutes.\n\u201cIf we can just keep the clean sheet, we know we are going to score at the other side. I think we knew that we weren\u2019t supposed to be that low in the table. It\u2019s good to see that, now, the results reflect the qualities that we have. It\u2019s also been much better defensively and that\u2019s been an emphasis point in the last few weeks.\u201d\n\n\n\n 4.29pm  \n\nIf Antonio Conte sounds worryingly grumpy and on the brink of jacking this lark in and heading off down the Amalfi Coast on a scooter, he also declared he was happy at Spurs as his first anniversary at the club approaches.\n\u201cI\u2019m enjoying my time at Tottenham. I think in one year we had a great path together with the club, the players and the fans. I\u2019m enjoying every single moment with my adventure in Tottenham,\u201d he tooted.\n\u201cFor sure, I discovered a modern club, a club with fantastic training ground, amazing stadium, the passion of our fans and at the same time also the demands of our fans. Because with our fans the demand is very high! Yeah, I continue to enjoy every day to stay here, to work here for this club.\u201d\n\n\n\n 4.21pm  \nAntonio Conte blasts VAR again\n\nTottenham manager Antonio Conte continued his tirade against VAR on Friday by insisting it is cutting the emotion of the game and joked he could make better decisions from his own home.\n\nSpurs were left furious during Wednesday\u2019s Champions League fixture with Sporting Lisbon when Harry Kane was denied a stoppage-time winner after he was adjudged to be marginally ahead of the ball and therefore offside.\nConte lambasted the technology and accused it of being dishonest against his team following the draw with Sporting, which means Tottenham still need a point in Marseille on Tuesday to qualify for the Champions League last 16.\nHe remained unhappy when he spoke at a press conference ahead of Saturday\u2019s trip to Bournemouth and said: \u201cWhat happened in the last game was incredible, incredible. You score, you are already qualified for the next round, you are celebrating and then you have to stay for five minutes to look at the situation with VAR and you take the decision and you don\u2019t know if its right or wrong.\n\u201cThis is not football in this way also because you cut the emotion, the emotion of everybody and especially the players because you don\u2019t know.\n\u201cYou score a goal and you don\u2019t know what happens later. Did someone commit a foul one minute before? Or discover a foul one minute before and then they go to disallow this? It happened this. It happened but it only happened when they want (it) to happen. This is the difference.\n\u201cBut when I stay at home and I see the image, I am watching another game and I see the image, the VAR, then for me it is easy to take the best decision. Instead then you see for example they take the opposite decision. Oh, I don\u2019t know football or maybe who stays in the VAR, they are seeing another image.\u201d\nThe Italian reiterated in his mind it was \u201cimpossible\u201d for VAR to make mistakes given the time and extra images the official gets to view. (PA Media)\n\nUpdated at 4.28pm BST\n\n\n 4.11pm  \n\nBack to the report on English football clubs failing to meet six of their eight diversity targets.\nCrystal Palace boss, Patrick Vieira, the only black manager in the Premier League, hopes Friday\u2019s findings will lead to more concerted action.\n\u201cYeah, I saw the FA communication and what they are trying to do and what is their target,\u201d he said. \u201cI would like them to be a little bit more ambitious on that side because I don\u2019t think that the numbers that they wanted to achieve are high enough.\u201d\nJust 10.3 per cent of the candidates hired for senior leadership roles at clubs came from black, Asian or mixed heritage background, well below the 15 per cent target.\nAll Premier League teams and 32 English Football League clubs have signed up to the code, which was introduced in 2020 to increase equality of opportunity and encourage recruitment of diverse talent across senior leadership teams, team operations and coaching set-ups.\nWhile the FA, Premier League and EFL produced strong results and exceeded in seven of the eight targets for the 2021-22 campaign, the lack of those in top jobs was still glaring.\nVieira has in recent weeks pointed to the absence of people from ethnic backgrounds in those positions, highlighting the imbalance between who is on the pitch and those with decision-making roles.\nAsked if he had any plans to help influence more progress, Vieira, now in his second season at Palace, said: \u201cI think the best way is to use the voice I have at the moment and to talk about it.\n\u201cThe positive aspect about it in this country is that there is a conversation. People are talking about it. So now the next level, I believe, is to be more ambitious than the report that has been put in place by the FA and something has to be done.\u201d (PA Media)\n\n\n\n 4.01pm  \n\nAm I the only person who didn\u2019t know Steve Cooper\u2019s dad was Keith Cooper? Passed me by that one despite a decent knowledge of former refs and where they came from. George Courtney, Spennymoor, etc.\n(From PA Media). Nottingham Forest boss Steve Cooper says his Football Association charge for post-match comments about referee Thomas Bramall is still being processed but admits the pressure of the job sometimes makes it hard to control emotions. Cooper said Bramall was known for being inconsistent after the 1-0 Premier League loss at Molineux where both sides had a penalty awarded after VAR intervention, while there was another incident in the first half.\nHe was sanctioned by the FA and had until Thursday night to respond. However, he said he was not in a position to talk about it ahead of Sunday\u2019s visit to Arsenal. \u201cI will talk when I can, but at the moment it is still going through the process so I am not thinking too much about it, I am focused on the game,\u201d he said.\nCooper, whose dad Keith is a former Premier League referee, said that the pressure of managing in the Premier League makes it hard to control emotions. \u201cIt is difficult for everybody involved, supporters, managers, players. I do my very best to try and stay in control whetever emotions you are feeling and in general I like to think I am OK at that,\u201d he said. \u201cYou aim to be the best version of yourself, whatever that might be.\n\u201cThey are emotional jobs, they take you to places you might not have felt before. You try and stay true to what you believe in and what you feel is right. Sometimes that might mean standing up for your club or for your team or something that you may do or say and that is how it is. Game in, game out you try and be at your best and I will try and do that on Sunday.\u201d\n\nForest head to the Emirates Stadium on Sunday fresh from the high of beating Liverpool last weekend. \u201cAlways when you win a game you hope to back it up with another positive performance and result, that is the intention going into this weekend, a incredibly tough game, especially away from home,\u201d he said. We always prepare for a team to be at their best and having looked at Arsenal in a bit more depth, you can see why they are where they are. It is more than a start now, we are futher down the line than that. They are really good for it, a lot of credit goes to Mikel [Arteta] and the team. Really tough game, as tough as it gets, but one we have to really focus on ourselves.\u201d\n\nUpdated at 4.04pm BST\n\n\n 3.52pm  \n\nAs former Sevilla and Villarreal boss Unai Emery prepares to take over at Aston Villa (presumably he\u2019s currently sat in his villa in Vilamoura listening to The Villagers), Villa caretaker boss Aaron Danks has heaped praise on the Spaniard.\n(Per PA Media): \u201cYou just have to look at his pedigree, what he\u2019s done and where he\u2019s worked to know he is a top coach. He is a high performer,\u201d said Danks. \u201cI really enjoyed watching his Villarreal team in the Champions League, like many supporters and coaches did. We\u2019re just really excited to welcome him to the club. There\u2019s been no contact, for me it\u2019s been head down and full focus on preparing the team for the game. I can only go on my own experience and when I moved to Belgium (as assistant to Vincent Kompany at Anderlecht), I had a month to prepare and there was a lot to get through. For someone and their staff to have seven days, I totally understand.\u201d\nLucas Digne has returned to training following a stress fracture but Boubacar Kamara (knee), Diego Carlos (knee) and Ludwig Augustinsson (hamstring) are out. Danks dropped skipper John McGinn for the 4-0 win over Brentford on Sunday after taking over following Steven Gerrard\u2019s dismissal but has been impressed with how the Scot has responded.\nHe said: \u201cJohn\u2019s a super professional and he\u2019s a great human being. His reaction has been nothing but positive. He came into the game excellently as we envisaged he would. Training has been fantastic, no issues whatsoever. I knew that with John, that\u2019s why he\u2019s contributed what he\u2019s contributed to this club. That\u2019s why the fans respect him the way they do and why his team-mates respect him so highly.\u201d\n\nUpdated at 4.05pm BST\n\n\n 3.42pm  \n\nMore on the shocking story involving Arsenal defender Pablo Mar\u00ed.\n\n\n\n\n 3.32pm  \n\nTottenham Hotspur have been fined \u00a320,000 after their players protested the decision to award Newcastle United the opening goal in the London side\u2019s 2-1 home defeat over the weekend, the FA said on Friday.\nSpurs goalkeeper Hugo Lloris was involved in a collision with Callum Wilson when attempting to deal with a long ball, with the Newcastle striker chipping the ball into an unguarded net.Spurs players immediatel y surrounded referee Jarred Gillett in protest and the decision to award the goal after a VAR check also found nothing wrong left the home side furious.\n\u201cTottenham Hotspur FC admitted failing to ensure that its players conducted themselves in an orderly fashion during the 31st minute, and also accepted the standard penalty,\u201d the FA said in a statement. (Reuters)\n\nUpdated at 4.05pm BST\n\n\n 3.23pm  \n\nAdama Traore is a man of the people!\nWould it be poor to say he then tried to put a supermarket trolley away in the bay but missed? Anyway, good on him. This from Reuters:\nA video showing Wolverhampton Wanderers winger Adama Traor\u00e9 challenging some young fans to a race in supermarket car park has been viewed more than a million times on social media.\n\nThe Spanish player, one of the fastest in the Premier League, was spotted by 12-year-old Charlie Smith and his cousins who asked the former Barcelona player for a photo. They then got more than they bargained for as Traor\u00e9 asked them if any of them could run faster than him, and challenged them to a dash across the car park. Traor\u00e9 showed no mercy as he sprinted ahead with the chuckling boys trailing in his wake.\n\u201cAs soon as we went off, I thought \u2018I might actually win this\u2019 because he was level with us,\u201d said Charlie Whitehouse, one of the youngsters in the video. \u201cBut then he gave it two seconds and was off. It was great. He smoked us.\u201d\nWolves fan and grassroots club chairman Darryl Smith, who posted the video of his son and cousins, said: \u201cAdama actually talks to the fans and I don\u2019t think all players do that. It\u2019s a great connection between the players and the fans. What a down to earth top man!\u201d\n\nUpdated at 4.05pm BST\n\n\n 3.12pm  \n\nPep Guardiola says Julian Alvarez will be the first option to replace Erling Haaland if the Norwegian striker isn\u2019t fit for Manchester City\u2019s trip to Leicester.\nAlvarez has scored only two league goals this season but Guardiola is not concerned given the Argentine striker\u2019s limited playing time.\n\u201cPlay 90 minutes every game and he will score goals, maybe not like Erling, but he will score goals,\u201d Guardiola said. \u201cI don\u2019t judge. I know how many minutes he plays and how difficult it is when you are not used to playing regularly ... since day one, we are really impressed with many things about him.\u201d\n\nUpdated at 4.05pm BST\n\n\n 3.03pm  \n\nIf you missed Antony\u2019s double spin showboat against Sheriff, here it is. Beautifully pointless? Pointlessly beautiful? Has Roy Keane passed comment yet?\n\nThe former Ajax winger scored in his first three Premier League games for Manchester United but hasn\u2019t registered in each of his last five matches in all competitions. His last goal at Old Trafford came on 4 September.\n\n\n\n 2.57pm  \n\nArsenal goalkeeper Aaron Ramsdale has called for the Gunners to go back to basics after they slipped to Europa League defeat at PSV Eindhoven. Arsenal were deservedly on the wrong end of a 2-0 loss as goals from Joey Veerman and Luuk de Jong secured the win for the hosts.\nIt was just a second defeat of the season for Arsenal, who sit top of the Premier League with their single loss coming at Manchester United last month. Defeat in Eindhoven follows a 1-1 draw at Southampton last weekend and, with Nottingham Forest the visitors to the Emirates Stadium on Sunday, Ramsdale is keen to get back on track.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a reality check,\u201d he told the Evening Standard. \u201cI just think we need to go back to what we were doing, our basics better than what we have shown in the past two games. What has gone on on the pitch we can\u2019t change right now, so Sunday it is full focus on the Premier League and getting back to winning ways we hope.\u201d\nRamsdale admits he made an error which led to de Jong\u2019s goal and refused to blame any other factors for the loss. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t help when you come away from home, goalkeeper makes a mistake, 2-0, uphill battle and it is one we have got to get back from,\u201d he added. \u201cThere are plenty of things we can take from this, as a team and individually. But we are a good enough team not to be blaming things, obviously the pitch, etc. There is no point talking about that. We just didn\u2019t really compete too well off the ball. Credit to them as well obviously, they were good with how they set up.\u201d (PA Media)\n\nUpdated at 4.06pm BST\n\n\n 2.48pm  \n\nAnd here\u2019s Graham Potter on the man who replaced him at Brighton, Roberto De Zerbi.\nDe Zerbi has yet to taste victory in five matches despite taking a 2-0 lead and drawing 3-3 at Liverpool in his opening game. Asked if that first win could come against Chelsea, Potter replied: \u201cOf course, they are capable of that. I think they have been unlucky, that is the only thing I can say, the performances have been good, there are positives there. You need luck and I don\u2019t think they have had any.\n\u201cI think Roberto has been in a few weeks now, you can see the ideas, the differences, there is definitely change there I would say. There is a new manager, new ideas and there is always something to learn, something to surprise.\u201d\n\nUpdated at 4.06pm BST\n\n\n 2.40pm  \n\nChelsea boss Graham Potter returns to his former club Brighton this weekend and has reported no new injury concerns for the trip south.\nChelsea are unbeaten in nine games under Potter so far, a sequence stretched by a 2-1 win away to RB Salzburg on Tuesday. Mateo Kovacic came off early in that game but isn\u2019t a concern. \u201cWe\u2019re pretty much the same as Salzburg,\u201d said Potter. \u201cMateo has no problem with his calf, it was more fatigue. [Kalidou] Koulibaly has an outside chance for Wednesday [Champions League game with Dynamo Zagreb] but not tomorrow.\u201d\nReece James, Wesley Fofana and N\u2019Golo Kant\u00e9 are all long-term injury absentees, with Potter previously reporting that the trio were unlikely to feature before the World Cup break.\n\nUpdated at 4.06pm BST\n\n\n 2.26pm  \nManchester City to assess Haaland fitness\n\nBut what of Erling Haaland\u2019s fitness after the striker came off at half-time against Borussia Dortmund?\nManchester City boss Pep Guardiola said after the 0-0 draw in Germany that the striker had a slight problem with his foot and a fever, making him a doubt for the weekend trip to Leicester.\nHere\u2019s the very latest from Pep: \u201cHe feels better, but we train this afternoon, and we will assess in these few hours. We will see how he feels. After we will decide \u2013 I will know it in two hours if he can play.\u201d\nGuardiola has also offered updates on England duo Kyle Walker and Kalvin Phillips. \u201cThey are not ready for Leicester,\u201d said Guardiola. \u201cThey are better, Kalvin especially. Apparently, when he came to Dortmund, he said he feels really well. He started to train with contact with the ball \u2013 he has not trained with his team-mates yet, but he feels really well, and we are surprised.\n\u201cIf he is fit and can play [at the World Cup] he can play, but right now, we don\u2019t know. They [Walker and Phillips] are optimistic. They are in touch with Gareth [Southgate]. Hopefully they can be ready and get selected.\u201d\n\nUpdated at 2.31pm BST\n\n\n 2.16pm  \n\nErling Haaland, the world\u2019s best footballer by a mile, has scored one goal from open play in three Manchester City matches since 8 October and fired blanks in his last two away games. By contrast, ungainly overpriced hot-head, Darwin Nunez, has scored in each of his last four starts for Liverpool.\nOkay, facts can be twisted but Nunez perhaps deserves more credit than he\u2019s getting. His manager, J\u00fcrgen Klopp, certainly seems pleased with the Uruguayan striker\u2019s efforts.\n\n\u201cDarwin came here after a short break, flew straight to Asia, didn\u2019t speak English, new team, and the price - and then everyone judges straight away. Started well, scored v City/Fulham, then red card. He was embarrassed. Confidence was knocked.\n\u201cHe\u2019s involved in a lot, a lot of finishing moments. It was a great month for him.\n\u201cDarwin is so exciting but he has to stay fit and be available all the time. We work on all different areas and the potential is incredible. Speed, attitude, a real worker, it\u2019s all possible to develop and learn. It\u2019s really exciting.\u201d\n\n\n\n 2.04pm  \n\nSome lines from the J\u00fcrgen Klopp press conference.\nOn being fined \u00a330,000 by the FA for improper conduct: haranguing assistant referee Gary Beswick in the win over Manchester City at Anfield: \u201cI know what I said and with a different face it would have been completely fine. It\u2019s the most expensive face! A lot of money but I heard it will be invested in something good which is fine.\u201d\nInjury updates on his team: \u201cI expect Jordan Henderson to be okay. Thiago will return too. It\u2019s still soon for Naby Keita and [Joel] Matip is still out. You don\u2019t have to ask about Diogo [Jota] or Luis [Diaz] for a while.\u201d\nHenderson took a knock to the knee in the 3-0 win over Ajax in midweek. Klopp also answers a question about central defender Ibrahima Konate\u2019s fitness: \u201cHe was not really ready for this [Ajax] game. In a very serious situation in the last five minutes maybe, but he\u2019s available now.\u201d\n\n\n\n 1.55pm  \n\nFrank Lampard has warned Everton cannot think last week\u2019s victory over Crystal Palace means they have solved their problems.\nThe Toffees ended a run of three straight defeats by beating Patrick Vieira\u2019s side 3-0 at Goodison Park in a performance Lampard described as a \u201ctemplate\u201d for his side going forward.\nBut despite that positive feeling, Lampard knows consistency will not come easily as he looks ahead to Saturday\u2019s trip to Fulham.\n\u201cIn a really small passage of time that I\u2019ve been here we\u2019ve been working towards something and you get games where things come together and there are a lot of positives,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThere are always things you can improve and as much as it was good, it\u2019s important to reflect on what can be better.\n\u201cOn the back of the results going into that game, we needed a result and a performance and the lads delivered, but we need to do that consistently now and improve...\n\u201cFor sure that\u2019s the next challenge. This league is hard, it won\u2019t be easy to do, not many do except the top teams. We were in a good moment last week but we go to a difficult opponent who are playing well themselves so it all starts again.\u201d\nLampard knows he must continue to adapt his tactics each week, but what encouraged him against Palace was the way the players executed what was asked of them.\n\u201cWhen I say \u2018template\u2019, let\u2019s not replicate those exact tactics or that system every game,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are different challenges, different threats every week in this league and you have to adjust but the way the players worked, the idea of how we wanted to play was there.\n\u201cThere\u2019ll be tweaks for Fulham who are different to Palace but I was pleased with the level of application from the lads, in every position, in every relationship on the pitch, the way they took on what we wanted to do and did it really well.\u201d (PA Media)\n\n\n\n 1.47pm  \n\nErik ten Hag believes Cristiano Ronaldo can again score 20-plus goals for Manchester United this season.\nRonaldo scored his third of the campaign in Thursday\u2019s 3-0 Europa League victory over Sheriff at Old Trafford.\n\n\n\n\n 1.38pm  \n\nOf course, Liverpool v Leeds brings this to mind. Kevin Keegan v Billy Bremner in the 1974 FA Charity Shield.\n\n\n\n\n\n 1.28pm  \n\nJ\u00fcrgen Klopp will be talking to the press at 1.30pm so we\u2019ll have news from the Liverpool boss coming up.\nA couple of Mo Salah stats ahead of Saturday evening\u2019s game with Leeds at Anfield: one fairly-well known but the other a slight surprise.\n\nSalah has been involved in six goals in two home Premier League appearances against Leeds United (5 goals, 1 assist) \nSalah has created more chances from open play than any other player in the Premier League this season (28). He\u2019s creating 2.6 chances per 90 minutes on average this season, his best rate in a single campaign in the competition\n\n\n\n\n 1.19pm  \n\nOver to Everton goalkeeper Jordan Pickford offering praise to \u201cbrilliant\u201d England boss Gareth Southgate. \n\u201cGareth is a brilliant manager,\u201d Pickford told the PA news agency.\n\u201cHe is brilliant and we will go to the World Cup positive. We will give it our best shot and hopefully bring the cup home.\n\u201cI think for us it is about making the nation proud and doing our best in the tournament. We know what we are capable of doing and we have great squad togetherness.\n\u201cTogetherness gets you so far, so I think if we haven\u2019t won in six, it is not the end of the world and we will still be going to Qatar as positive as anything after the last two tournaments.\u201d\n\nAfter he started the games with Hungary and Germany in June, the Everton goalkeeper was rested for the second set of matches during the same month before a thigh injury ruled him out of September\u2019s fixtures.\nHe added: \u201cI can\u2019t wait. I was injured for the last camp, which was unfortunate, but I have got myself fit and I am raring to go.\n\u201cI am playing for Everton again now so in a good run of form leading up to the World Cup and looking forward to the World Cup itself.\u201d\nThe Toffees embarked on a six-match unbeaten run before narrow defeats to Manchester United, Tottenham and Newcastle were followed by a 3-0 thrashing of Crystal Palace.\nBut Pickford insisted: \u201cThe manager (Lampard) is really good. His staff around him are brilliant as well.\u201d (PA Media)\nPickford was speaking at the launch of Activision\u2019s Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II. Which was brilliant.\n\n\n\n 1.10pm  \n\nLet\u2019s start with an incredible fact. Well, maybe not.\nHere\u2019s a thing. Scan the Premier League table and no team has accrued more points on the road than at home so far.\nThat\u2019s quite a contrast to the lockdown season when nine of the top 11 had better away records. Fans make a difference I guess.\nLiverpool are perhaps the most extreme \u2018homers\u2019 this season having banked 14 of their modest tally of 16 points at Anfield.\nThis all sounds a little like a Partridge \u2018crab sticks\u2019 fact so best move on. \n\n\n\n 1.03pm  \n\nThanks John. Hope you enjoy that Coldplay album Max sent you.\n\n\n\n 1.01pm  \n\nRight, lunch calls, and David Tindall will be taking over from here. \n\n\n\n 12.51pm  \n\nThe World Cup draws near and we will be hearing plenty more of these types of stories. And hopefully, such issues won\u2019t be allowed to fade away when the football kicks off. \n\nWe have committed every effort to ensuring that this World Cup has had a transformative impact on improving lives, especially for those involved in constructing the competition and non-competition venues we\u2019re responsible for. Protecting the health, safety, security, and dignity of every worker contributing to this World Cup is our priority.\n\n\n\n\n\n 12.25pm  \n\nReport released on Friday shows clubs are not doing enough and without radical transparency there is no short-term solution, says Sanjay Bhandari. \n\nFor many people from under-represented or minority communities, much of the last 50 years has been a depressing cycle of promises, raised hopes and disappointment. Football is at a crucial point and needs to make the right choices so the FLDC does not become the latest entry in a 50-year catalogue of missed opportunities, turning initial positive intent into resentment and distrust. If the collective energy and impetus generated by George Floyd\u2019s death have run out already, what will drive sustained change?\n\n\n\n\n\n 12.17pm  \n\nWhat was it like playing for Ars\u00e8ne Wenger? Sylvinho tells all. \n\nAnd, above all, whatever happened in the team, Ars\u00e8ne was there. He didn\u2019t neglect any detail. He had everything under control. It was the first time I saw a coach making decisions on something like a new training ground, which Arsenal were building at that time.\nHe had his hands in everything: how the players arrived for training, where we put our boots, the food we would be eating. Everything was very well planned by him. He was a very experienced person who had worked all over the world. Ars\u00e8ne also knew how to control everything around the player, but without overwhelming you. Today this is easier to see, but in the years I was at Arsenal \u2013 from 1999 to 2001 \u2013 very few coaches did this.\n\n\n\n\n\n 11.51am  \nEnglish football clubs failed to meet six of eight diversity targets\n\nImportant story from Paul Macinnes. \n\nResults from the second year of the FA\u2019s leadership diversity code show a step change in representation has not been achieved, despite an increased focus on equality by players and organising bodies. Roughly a third of men\u2019s clubs in the top four divisions are yet to sign up to the charter.\n\n\n\n\n\n 11.39am  \n\nMore detail on the Pablo Mar\u00ed story from PA Media.\n\nMonza president Adriano Galliani, who visited Mari along with the Serie A side\u2019s head coach Raffaele Palladino, told Gazzetta: \u201cPablo is an amazing guy. He had the strength to joke and tell me that he will be back on the pitch on Monday (for a scheduled league match against Bologna). I brought him greetings from (club president Silvio) Berlusconi and everyone else. His team-mates wanted to come here but obviously it was not possible.\n\u201cThe Monza squad are in shock about Mari and so we have asked for the game against Bologna to be postponed.\u201d\nSpeaking further about the attack, Galliani added: \u201cIt is shocking news. My thoughts are with the families - what happened today seems impossible for a city like Milan. It can\u2019t be possible that someone gets up in the morning to go to work and then loses their life because of the actions of a criminal.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe Corriere della Sera says former Napoli and Inter Milan player Massimo Tarantino was among those who immobilised and disarmed the attacker, with the 51-year-old quoted by the paper as saying: \u201cI\u2019m not a hero. I didn\u2019t do anything special.\u201d\n\n\n\nUpdated at 12.41pm BST\n\n\n 11.22am  \n\nAnother week, another Eddie Howe complaint about people talking about the money. He celebrates a year in the job on 8 November. \n\nMoney doesn\u2019t guarantee success. It certainly helps, but it doesn\u2019t guarantee anything. You can recruit very badly and these days, that will cost you a huge sum of money, so it\u2019s about a mixture of things.\nTime flies. It\u2019s incredible to think as the months have ticked by that it\u2019s nearly led to a year for me here. We\u2019ve enjoyed it, but it\u2019s gone so quickly.\nI do feel there\u2019s an element of just starting with the team and we\u2019ve got so much more to achieve and more to do. But I if am sat here in another year\u2019s time, I\u2019d probably be saying exactly the same thing.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n 11.08am  \n\nMax Rushden goes on a hunt for the nice things in life.\n\nIt\u2019s hard not to get disheartened. But even if football is destined to be run by people who don\u2019t have its best interests at heart, can we find enough kernels of hope in the gloom? This week I asked on Twitter for examples of people in the game \u2013 clubs, players, fans, whoever \u2013 doing good, however small. Thanks to those who replied about people picking up litter all the way to caring for footballers seeking political asylum. It\u2019s not exhaustive and it won\u2019t win a Pulitzer. You may find it a bit twee but here\u2019s a list in no particular order that may restore your faith for five minutes:\n\n\n\n\n\n 10.50am  \n\nWolves travel to Brentford on Saturday afternoon. They have scored five goals all season.\n\n\n\nUpdated at 12.41pm BST\n\n\n 10.46am  \nJesse Marsch: 'I'm sick of it'\n\nJesse Marsch is not a happy man. Oh no. Quite the rant here ahead of Leeds\u2019 visit to Liverpool on Saturday night.\n\nIf we go game to game and you look at the fact we haven\u2019t won in eight games based on how we\u2019ve performed over the eight games, it\u2019s almost impossible to believe that two points is all that we\u2019ve earned.\nBut that\u2019s our reality right, in those eight games and all the phases in those games? What if Luis (Sinisterra) scores at Brighton on the two-inch line and it doesn\u2019t go wide?\nWhat if we score the penalty against Arsenal? What if - you can go through what ifs, but it doesn\u2019t matter, right? You could still look at the metrics and you could look at different things and you could say, we\u2019re actually doing OK, which I believe. But in the end again, right now, if we continue losing matches, then everything in the entire project is in jeopardy. We\u2019ve got to figure out a way to stop that.\nI\u2019m a little angry right now. I\u2019m tired of playing matches where we\u2019re in the match and in many cases we\u2019re better than the opponent and walking away with nothing. I\u2019m tired of not capitalising on moments when we\u2019re the better team and I\u2019m tired of giving away goals too cheaply, tired of not getting results we should be getting.\nFourteen years as a player, 13 years a coach and I\u2019ve never lost this much in my career. I\u2019m sick of it. So I\u2019m trying to figure out which guys can be counted on at the highest level right now, what kind of decisions need to be made in terms of match plans. I need to help find the group confidence and find the guys who are ready to fight for everything right now in these next matches, to do everything we can to get the points we need.\n\n\nUpdated at 10.52am BST\n\n\n 10.41am  \n\nA reminder that Newcastle have climbed to fourth without their big summer signing and their prime attacking force. We won\u2019t be seeing Alexander Isak for a bit, but Allan Saint-Maximim looks likely to be back this weekend. \n\nPer PA Media.\nNewcastle boss Eddie Howe has revealed record signing Alexander Isak has undergone injections in a bid to resolve the thigh injury which has sidelined him since the middle of last month\nThe 60million Sweden striker, who will not play again before the World Cup, last turned out for the Magpies in the 1-1 Premier League draw with Bournemouth on September 17.\nHowe said: \u201cAlex has been having a couple of injections into his injury, into his thigh. I believe that\u2019s gone well and the medical team are happy with where he currently stands. But it is a longer-term injury - I think it\u2019s a five, six-week injury, so as I said before, he won\u2019t be back before the World Cup break. But we\u2019re hopeful that as we begin our second pre-season, he\u2019s there ready to train.\u201d\nMeanwhile, Howe provided an update on Allan Saint-Maximin\u2019s recovery from a long-standing hamstring problem with the Frenchman hoping to return to the squad for Saturday\u2019s home clash with Aston Villa. \nHe said: \u201cCurrently Maxi is very good, he\u2019s in a really good place. The recent setback he had with his hamstring was a huge blow to him, but I think it almost reset him mentally to go, \u2018Right, I\u2019ve got to really look after myself and get my recovery right\u2019. He\u2019s been having really intense treatment, three sessions a day - two at the training ground, one at night at home - so a real dedication to his profession to try to get himself back as quickly as possible for what is a intense period of games now before the break.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n 10.24am  \n\nJacob Steinberg on Graham Potter\u2019s tactical revolution at Chelsea. \n\nWith Potter, though, part of the fun is trying to work out where the players are going to be when the starting XI is announced. In reality the former Brighton manager\u2019s system against Salzburg had Jorginho screening the defence, Mateo Kovacic and Conor Gallagher driving forward from central midfield, Kai Havertz accompanying Aubameyang up front and, most fascinatingly, Raheem Sterling and Christian Pulisic as the wing-backs.\n\n\n\n\n\n 10.17am  \n\nShocking news from Italy last night. \n\n\n\n\n\n 10.17am  \n\nTen things to look out for this weekend, including this. \n\nMarsch on the brink at Anfield\nAnfield is no place for a struggling visiting manager in need of respite. Last season Marcelo Bielsa arrived under pressure at Leeds and looked condemned following a 6-0 defeat. The end was confirmed following another heavy loss at home to Tottenham three days later. His replacement, Jesse Marsch, faces Liverpool in a similar but arguably weaker position given fans have turned in a way that did not happen under the revered Argentinian. Two points from the last 24 available has also fuelled the unrest. Leeds\u2019 strongest performances have come against the stronger sides this season, however, notably Chelsea and Arsenal, and their manager desperately needs a repeat as he strives to win support and time. It is a considerable task at a precarious moment. Liverpool are unbeaten in 29 Premier League home games. Andy Hunter\n\n\n\n\n\n 10.11am  \n\nHere\u2019s today\u2019s hot topic of debate: Antony showing off his lollipops last night against Sheriff. \nSome people are getting very heated indeed about this one. \n\n\n\n\n 10.06am  \nPreamble\n\nThe Premier League trains churns on, now not far from reaching its World Cup destination. A very full Saturday awaits, getting underway when improved Leicester take on Manchester City. Will Erling Haaland be fit? Find out here. Possibly.\nTottenham\u2019s slump to con\u021binue at Bournemouth? Gary O\u2019Neil\u2019s team are in a slump, too, and the two managers can compare VAR notes. Has Antonio Conte calmed down yet?\nLiverpool, having lost last week at Nottingham Forest, take on Leeds on Saturday night and a win could place Jesse Marsch in real jeopardy. Meanwhile, Unai Emery will be in the stands, awaiting work permit, as his new club, Aston Villa, who he takes over on 1 November, visit Newcastle, the club he turned down last year.\nBrighton v Chelsea is a quick return for Graham Potter, he is still unbeaten at his new club while his old club have not won a game since he left. Brentford are in mid-table, but coming off a defeat to Villa last week. Can Wolves, still managed by Steve \u201cInteresting he\u2019s still in charge\u201d Davis, score a goal?\nFrank Lampard\u2019s Everton travel to Fulham off the back of last week\u2019s defeat of Crystal Palace, whose match with Southampton is a meeting of the Premier League\u2019s great enigmas.\nAnd the Europa League candidates both play on Sunday, with Manchester United welcoming West Ham while Arsenal, poor against PSV last night, welcome Nottingham Forest, fresh off that Liverpool win.\nA look ahead to all that, with press conferences and teams to come, too, plus the very latest from the world of soccer. Join me. Join us.\n\n"

                    "body": "News magazines from Time to Austria\u2019s Profil have put Volodymyr Zelenskiy on their covers as Person of the Year 2022. The business weekly Forbes\u2019s choice was a little more surprising: naming Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, \u201cthe world\u2019s most powerful woman\u201d. A good choice. After a weak start three years ago, the former German defence minister is becoming Europe\u2019s crisis manager par excellence. With her somewhat formal, stiff demeanour, Von der Leyen may have won few hearts and minds, but during the pandemic, and especially since Vladimir Putin\u2019s invasion of Ukraine in February, she has established a reputation for getting things done in Europe. VDL, as she is also known, \u201cis a machine\u201d, a senior official in the commission told me. \u201cShe\u2019s tough, focused and extremely efficient.\u201d  The \u201cQatar-gate\u201d corruption scandal unfolding in the European parliament may have put Von der Leyen on the spot for not having proposed a stronger EU ethics body. But that criticism is unfair. She has worked on it, but the parliament has so far rejected the much stricter rules that apply to the commission. For EU governments, which find parliament a nuisance anyway and are in no mood to subject their own institution \u2013 the law-making European Council \u2013 to the commission\u2019s transparency standards either, VDL\u2019s worth lies elsewhere. In a turbulent world, Europe\u2019s self-perception \u2013 as a peaceful, values-based community with a relatively open market and scant geopolitical clout \u2013 is sorely tested and requires urgent adjustment. Without the commission they cannot even begin to do this. With Russia waging an economic and information war against the EU, China trying to squeeze political capital out of economic dependencies and the US embarking on a protectionist path, Europe\u2019s successful model needs protection. So Europe\u2019s leaders are now taking steps towards \u201cmore Europe\u201d that they were previously unwilling to take. During the pandemic, they agreed on joint vaccine procurement and large financial injections to stricken economies. Since February, they have beefed up common security and border controls, welcomed millions of Ukrainian refugees, relaunched the EU\u2019s enlargement process and moved to secure common energy supplies. Meanwhile, Europe is seeking to become the world\u2019s first carbon-neutral bloc. European governments do not like to \u201cEuropeanise\u201d powers held at national level \u2013 unless, as the founding father Jean Monnet once said, there is a crisis and \u201cthey do not know what to do\u201d. Now is such a moment. National leaders face huge problems they cannot solve on their own. They look for joint solutions, with Von der Leyen both service-provider and midwife. The commission\u2019s first female president\u2019s secret is neither that she occupies an unchallenged powerful position, nor her charisma. EU decision-making has become increasingly intergovernmental in recent years, with a corresponding loss in power for \u201cBrussels\u201d. The member nations\u2019 leaders may agree to European solutions, even on issues that are politically sensitive for their citizens, such as security, monetary policy, health or migration. But they want to keep their implementing body, the commission, on a short leash. They constantly ask the commission to submit to them draft proposals for new European laws and regulations. At the same time, they weaken EU institutions \u2013 and often bypass parliament \u2013 by cutting budgets and keeping control of the implementation of policies to themselves. During the pandemic, they agreed to jointly borrow more than \u20ac700bn to support affected countries, while insisting that all 27 heads of state and government co-decide what to allocate to whom. The same is now happening with energy security, migration and foreign policy. Last week, all 27 had to sign off on an \u20ac18bn aid package for Ukraine \u2013 which Hungary threatened to veto unless its own funding from Brussels was unblocked. Thus, the EU is becoming one big bazaar for national governments, complete with haggling and dramatic walkouts. This renders compromises more byzantine and complex, less transparent and less accountable. But more than ever, member states need the expertise of the European Commission, legal and otherwise, to draw up common policies, plans and compromises. Von der Leyen is supplying this around the clock. A commission official tells me she is \u201cbetter\u201d than her famous predecessor Jacques Delors. This remark underlines how the EU is evolving. Delors drove the single market and monetary union, sealed in the Maastricht Treaty. He was a visionary. Von der Leyen is more of a pragmatist. Member states demand more than ever of Brussels \u2013 from cheap gas and tougher anti-corruption rules to a new state aid policy to prevent companies moving to the US.  To deliver on all these things, Von der Leyen oversees the commission like a military operation. She sleeps in a small space next to her office (for which she pays rent), regularly asking staff on Friday evenings to prepare reports for Sunday morning meetings. In policy terms, she runs a tight ship, keeping everything close to her chest (including Brexit talks), often leaving other commissioners in the dark. This does not make her popular among staff. Employees complain they are chronically overworked. Vacancies stay open for months because appointments have not had VDL\u2019s imprimatur.  This, however, is how the former physician delivers. National diplomats, always ready to scapegoat the commission, now praise it for giving them the service they demand. Occasionally, she uses that trust to steer them as in the old days when the commission was a more powerful force. She has nudged them, for example, towards controversial decisions they disliked \u2013 such as withholding more than half of Hungary\u2019s European funding for violating the EU\u2019s rule of law conditionality. This principled stance has earned Von der Leyen much respect in the parliament, whose members had started the first procedures against Hungary years ago and were keen to see them bear fruit in the end. Herding the 27 governments towards common decisions should be a task for the president of the European Council, Charles Michel. He commands little respect in European capitals, even less in Brussels. So heads of government often turn to the commission president to perform this role too. In VDL, Europe seems finally to be getting that single telephone number that Henry Kissinger always said he needed if he wanted to call Europe.

                    "body": "The Melbourne Cup slogan \u2013 \u201cthe race that stops a nation\u201d \u2013 has seemed faintly ridiculous in the past two years, when the pandemic brought much of Australia to a grinding halt for months \u2013 rather than just an afternoon in November. But even before Covid stopped the crowds turning up to Flemington, attendance numbers were dwindling. This was taken by some as a sign of a broader loss of affection for the race. Some blame increasing animal welfare concerns after the deaths of horses. Others point to the higher awareness of the ills of gambling. Still others say that the Australian tradition of a punt on the horses has been subsumed by the rise of international, fly-in, fly-out winners and the focus on flash frocks and glamorous celebrities at the track. Dr Katie Greenaway, a psychology lecturer at the University of Melbourne, says language such as \u201cthe race that stops a nation\u201d tries to bake in a sense of unity.  Sign up for our free morning and afternoon email newsletters from Guardian Australia for your daily news roundup  \u201cBut maybe that was from a time when there weren\u2019t the more negative associations with this particular event,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s an event that can be branded as Australian, when people think it says something about who we are as a nation, a nation that has a day off for a horse race. What other country would do that? It implicates a national identity that distinguishes us from other groups. \u201cIn recent years, though, the meaning of the race has changed in people\u2019s minds. It\u2019s become controversial, associated with things people don\u2019t want to be associated with, like animal cruelty, gambling problems and wealth disparity.\u201d  The Melbourne Cup \u2013 the Lexus Melbourne Cup \u2013 is a world away from most other races in Australia, with its $8m prize pool. And its fatal legacy. In 2020, Derby winner Anthony Van Dyck became the seventh horse to die in recent years. Jockey Kerrin McEvoy was fined $50,000 for excessive use of the whip. Cup-related deaths and injuries have prompted a fierce backlash, along with a review and a promise by Racing Victoria to do better. The Greens\u2019 animal welfare spokesperson, Mehreen Faruqi, is a vocal supporter of the #nuptothecup campaign, which has been running for a decade but has gained much wider visibility in response to recent deaths.  She says the racing industry\u2019s social licence is \u201cclearly fading\u201d, and describes the cup as \u201cthe most lavish symbol of the gambling-fuelled animal cruelty of horse racing\u201d. New Greens-commissioned polling by Lonergan Research found more than half those surveyed (54%) thought horses should not be raced for gambling and entertainment. Even more (59%) thought it was cruel. \u2018It really delineates the haves and the have-nots\u2019 It\u2019s hard to judge the cup\u2019s popularity by attendance numbers at Flemington. Thanks to Covid they were capped last year and no spectators were allowed in 2020. In 2019, the last pre-pandemic year, 81,408 people turned up for the cup and 276,186 to the carnival overall. That\u2019s a significant drop from a decade before when it was 102,161 to the cup and 368,929 overall. The number of those watching on television has also been shrinking, but there are so many confounding factors \u2013 such as the rise of streaming and of working from home \u2013 it\u2019s almost meaningless to compare. But there\u2019s no doubt in recent years it has become increasingly controversial \u2013 and not just because of animal welfare and gambling concerns. Our Watch has warned about an increase in domestic violence after major sporting events, including the cup. This year, residents complained that the wall built to save Flemington from flooding had done so at the expense of their homes. That chimes with the growing sense that, rather than being representative of a \u201cclassless\u201d nation, the race is emblematic of wealth disparity. \u201cIt really delineates the haves and the have-nots,\u201d Greenaway says. \u201cIt can bring up a lot of political divisiveness, and that can undermine people\u2019s enjoyment of the simple bygone era.\u201d \u201cThe cup really exposes the power and influence of the gambling and racing industries,\u201d Faruqi says. \u201cThe industry\u2019s profits are protected and advanced over and above animals and people. \u201cThose harmed by the gambling, violence and alcoholism associated with the cup are all considered collateral damage.\u201d While the anti-racing campaign #nuptothecup springs into action again in preparation for Tuesday\u2019s race, it now has a counterpart in #kickupforracing, started by Vicky Leonard, who promotes thoroughbred racing in Australia. She plans to build up an \u201carmy of ambassadors\u201d to counter the anti-cup sentiment and to promote horse racing. But even she is not an unequivocal supporter of the cup, saying it is in danger of ruining the rest of the industry. \u201cOne of the things that\u2019s devastating for people in the industry is that the one race the public pay attention to has monumentally let us down,\u201d she says. \u201c[The Melbourne Cup] is not indicative at all of what horse racing in Australia is like. It\u2019s the safest country in the world to race horses. \u201cIt is in danger of ruining our industry. It\u2019s gutting. It\u2019s so offensive that the industry is [receiving] vitriol when it\u2019s completely untrue.\u201d Leonard says she does not represent Racing NSW or any other racing body. She arrived in Australia from New Zealand a decade ago, and says she was \u201cshocked\u201d by what the people she met believed about racing, so she went on a mission to counter their arguments. \u2018The race that segments a nation\u2019 A 2020 Essential poll found about one in three Australians have never been interested in the Melbourne Cup and will not place a bet. Of the 1,063 people surveyed, 16% said they \u201cregularly bet\u201d on horse races and would place a bet on the Melbourne Cup, while 26% said they \u201crarely bet\u201d on horse races but would place a bet on the Melbourne Cup. The same proportion would watch but not bet. Three in four people said the cup was \u201ca unique part of Australia\u2019s national identity\u201d but almost half said they had \u201cbecome less interested\u201d in it because of concerns about animal cruelty. Another 27% said they were less interested because of concerns about gambling.  Data from an earlier Essential poll (with similar results) was used as the basis for an article in the journal Animals last year, which called the cup \u201cthe race that segments a nation\u201d. The study found people\u2019s attitudes were \u201cmuch more complex than simple binary views of being for or against thoroughbred horse racing, gambling or animal cruelty\u201d, and that they varied depending on gender, employment status and age. Men were more likely to be regular gamblers, as were those in full or part-time employment. Women were more likely to be losing interest in the cup because of animal cruelty concerns, but \u201cintentions to place a bet appeared to be unaffected by gender or income\u201d.  The authors point out that \u201cnot all those who are against animal cruelty perceive horse racing as cruel\u201d. Racing Victoria has tightened up its rules, and says its aim is to \u201creduce the rate of race-day fatalities in flats [as opposed to steeple-jumping] racing towards 0%\u201d.  The regulator has committed $25m over three years on an equine welfare action plan, and a spokesperson says it is \u201cseeing positive outcomes as a result\u201d. Each horse in the cup must have passed two veterinary inspections and a CT scan of its limbs, and more research is being done on injury prevention and early detection of problems. \u201cAll within the Victorian thoroughbred racing industry share a common love of the horse and are committed to ensuring the best possible welfare outcomes for the sports\u2019 equine athletes before, during and after racing,\u201d the spokesperson said. Greenaway says the way people think of big events can change over time. \u201cIt can change and move away from saying something good about who we are, something positive\u2026 getting together at the pub, having a day off work, things that make people feel good,\u201d she says. \u201cIt can drive a sense of oneness with the nation\u2026 but then it can start being associated with bad things.\u201d"

                    "body": "Southampton have confirmed Nathan Jones as their manager on a three-and-a-half-year contract. He has joined from Luton Town and will be in the dugout for Saturday\u2019s trip to Liverpool after watching Wednesday\u2019s Carabao Cup shootout win over Sheffield Wednesday at St Mary\u2019s from the stands. Southampton and Luton had broadly agreed a compensation package for Jones, believed to be \u00a32.5m, before he took charge of his final game for the Championship side on Tuesday, at his former club Stoke.  \u201cI\u2019m really proud to be given this opportunity,\u201d Jones said. \u201cI know a lot about the club from back in the days of The Dell, to coming here to St Mary\u2019s, and it\u2019s a wonderful football club. \u201cA lot of my family are Southampton fans, which doesn\u2019t half help, and I feel really, really proud to be given the opportunity, and I\u2019m really looking forward to getting started. Obviously, I wanted to manage in the Premier League, I\u2019ve dreamt of that since I\u2019ve become a coach or a manager, but this club in particular \u2013 because of how it\u2019s run, because of the structure, because of how they look deeper than just results \u2013 really appeals to me.\u201d Jones, a former Brighton, Southend and Yeovil defender, has been highly successful at Luton across two spells. In the first he took them from League Two strugglers to the promotion spots in League One before leaving for Stoke in January 2019. On his return he saved them from relegation back to League One in 2020 and after two years of progress led the club into last season\u2019s Championship playoffs. Jones has been joined at Southampton by his assistants Chris Cohen, with whom he played at Yeovil, and Alan Sheehan. Jones, 49, admitted to being \u201cflattered\u201d by Southampton\u2019s interest in him after Luton\u2019s 2-0 defeat at Stoke. \u201cI know my strengths and if a group buys into that, then I can manage at any level,\u201d he said. Jones posed for pictures with Saints fans in the stands before kick-off, but then saw his team fall behind when Josh Windass latched on to a Fisayo Dele-Bashiru pass and thumped the ball beyond Alex McCarthy in Southampton\u2019s goal. The equaliser came just before half-time when James Ward-Prowse converted from the penalty spot after Moussa Djenepo was brought down by Marvin Johnson. That proved the end of the scoring, leaving Jones to extend his trip on the south coast to watch the penalties. He will get to take charge of the Saints in the next round after they beat Wednesday 6-5 in the shootout, after McCarthy saved Dominic Iorfa\u2019s spot-kick. \u2022 This article was amended on 10 November 2022. An earlier version incorrectly stated that Nathan Jones led Luton to back-to-back promotions."

                    "body": "Virgin Atlantic has withdrawn its support for Heathrow\u2019s third runway plans amid an ongoing row over the cost of flying from Britain\u2019s biggest airport. The carrier had been one of the most prominent airline backers of expansion before the pandemic. But on Monday its chief executive, Shai Weiss, hit out at Heathrow\u2019s proposal to increase landing charges by 120% and called on the aviation regulator, the CAA, to reform a \u201cbroken\u201d system and \u201cpay closer attention to the abuse of power by a de facto monopolistic airport\u201d. He added: \u201cUntil that happens, it is difficult to see how expansion at Heathrow can be supported.\u201d  The CAA said this summer Heathrow would be allowed to raise charges by 56% next year, to more than \u00a330 a passenger, but would have to trim them by 2026 \u2013 a proposal that Heathrow said \u201cunderestimated\u201d the need for investment. Weiss said Heathrow\u2019s plan to raise charges was \u201cgreat for the airport and its mostly foreign shareholders\u201d - including Qatar and China\u2019s sovereign wealth fund \u2013 but \u201ca bad deal for consumers, airlines and the UK economy\u201d. Speaking at the Airlines 2022 conference in central London on Monday, Weiss said that, along with other carriers, \u201cwe have fought long and hard to ensure the CAA uses its powers to ensure this would not happen and encouraged the UK government to pay closer attention to the abuse of power by a de facto monopolistic airport\u201d. The row has festered following a difficult summer in which Heathrow forecast lower demand and then blamed airlines for not staffing up sufficiently to accommodate all flights, imposing a 100,000 passengers a day cap. Weiss added: \u201cThis is not just about the next price control period in four years\u2019 time. Everyone in this room will recognise the damage to consumer confidence that summer disruption caused. \u201cA repeat of this in summer 2023 is completely avoidable if honest and accurate passenger forecasts are used now for resource planning and building resilience.\u201d Appealing to the CAA and British government, he said: \u201cThe regulatory framework and process is simply not working. It is broken and must be reformed.\u201d Questioned afterwards, Weiss told the Guardian he would still back expansion at the airport, including the controversial third runway, if conditions were met, including lower charges so it \u201cremains competitive consumers are protected\u201d, as well as \u201cmassive renovation\u201d of Heathrow\u2019s Terminal 3 where Virgin is based. While the airline had been one of the runway\u2019s biggest airline cheerleaders, Weiss said there was \u201cno longer unequivocal support\u201d. He ruled out a return to Gatwick, which Virgin left during Covid, however, saying there was \u201cno connectivity\u201d. Weiss said the carrier had become more efficient since focusing all its operations on one London airport. John Holland-Kaye, the Heathrow chief executive, told the Guardian he expected to continue to \u201chave a constructive relationship and conversations\u201d with Virgin, and that redevelopment of Terminal 3 or a move to the new Terminal 2 was in the airport\u2019s medium-term plans. A Heathrow spokesperson said: \u201cTo deliver the airport service passengers expect, two things are needed: for our regulator to give us the ability to invest in the airport; and for all the operators at the airport to work together building back capacity. These are our focus right now.\u201d Willie Walsh, head of the International Air Transport Association, backed Weiss\u2019s calls to change how Heathrow\u2019s funding is decided. He said: \u201cHeathrow was lowballing its forecasts and talking down the demand because it was in their interests to convince the CAA that passenger numbers will be lower. It shows that the system isn\u2019t fit for purpose.\u201d "

                    "body": "England versus South Africa. A World Cup semi-final that \u2013 if the rest of the tournament is anything to go by \u2013 is likely to go to the wire. Heather Knight at the helm, facing off against Marizanne Kapp, Laura Wolvaardt and co. If that all sounds familiar, it\u2019s because it was exactly the situation faced by England on their path to world domination five years ago, at home in 2017.\nOn that occasion, at Bristol, England were left relying on an unlikely hero with the bat \u2013 Anya Shrubsole. With England eight wickets down and needing two runs to win from the last three balls, Shrubsole stuck out her bat and flayed a boundary through point: cue heartbreak for South Africa and relief for England. The good news, if you are English, is that Shrubsole will be available for selection in Thursday\u2019s repeat of the 2017 semi-final, at Christchurch, after being rested against Bangladesh.\n\nDespite Shrubsole\u2019s availability, Knight is hoping that this time around the semi-final will not be decided by England\u2019s No 10. \u201cIt\u2019d be a little bit nicer if it wasn\u2019t as close, because that\u2019s one of the most nervous finishes of a cricket game I\u2019ve ever had,\u201d she said on Monday. But this is a tournament in which England lost their first three matches before just about jittering across the line in must-win games against India and New Zealand. Meanwhile South Africa have experienced four final-over finishes; their most recent \u2013 against India \u2013 came down to the final ball. Another close match may well be in the offing.\nKnight brushed off England\u2019s poor start to the tournament, saying that her side are \u201cin a very good place\u201d. She said: \u201cIt\u2019s been a remarkable turnaround. It shows the character that we\u2019ve got in this group to pick ourselves up after a poor start to the competition. We\u2019ve built a bit of momentum in the last few games. We feel like we\u2019re peaking at the right time.\u201d\nIt is true that England have now won four matches on the trot, facing down the ignominy of being eliminated at the group stage as defending champions. But given that their only convincing wins have come against bottom-placed Pakistan and Bangladesh, a semi-final against a South Africa side who finished above them in the table is going to be a stern test.\n\nEngland have deployed the same approach throughout the tournament: hand Shrubsole and Katherine Brunt the new ball and build the team around that, whether they make breakthroughs or not. Freya Davies bowled a consistent, nagging line and length against Bangladesh, returning two for 36, while the left-armer Tash Farrant remains on the sidelines. Nonetheless, Knight has already indicated that England will be reverting to the usual suspects for Thursday\u2019s semi-final.\nBizarrely, Charlie Dean\u2019s selection also remains up in the air, despite the fact that she has taken more wickets for England in the tournament (10) than any other bowler bar Sophie Ecclestone.\nKnight has been effusive in her praise of the young off-spinner, who was brought into the side last summer based on the captain\u2019s own hunch after playing alongside her at London Spirit in the Hundred. \u201cSometimes going into these big world events, you don\u2019t know how players are going to react,\u201d Knight said. \u201cThe way she\u2019s come in, she\u2019s taken wickets, she\u2019s dealt with the pressure, has been a big positive for her.\u201d Nonetheless, she refused to confirm whether Dean would play on Thursday, saying that it depended on pitch conditions.\n\nWith no shake-up on the cards, it looks likely that South Africa will face an almost identical team to the one they beat by three wickets in the group stage. England have overcome some of their failings since then \u2013 their fielding has dramatically improved, while the number of extras conceded has fallen too. But their new opening partnership of Tammy Beaumont and Danni Wyatt, whose best stand this tournament is 20 against Pakistan, will once again come under scrutiny against a South African bowling lineup widely considered the best in the world. Kapp proved England\u2019s nemesis last time, bagging her first five-wicket haul in international cricket and scoring 32 from 42 balls after South Africa\u2019s run-chase had stalled. The seamers Shabnim Ismail and Ayabonga Khaka, who are two of the top five wicket-takers in the tournament to date, are also potent threats.\nShould England succeed in reaching the final, it will constitute a dramatic turnaround of fortunes. But for Knight, this semi-final is a chance to look forward, not back. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to go crazy and make a huge deal of it,\u201d she said of her side\u2019s earlier run of losses. \u201cWe go in as equals, and start afresh on Thursday.\u201d\n"

                    "body": "A year and a day since his installation as Newcastle\u2019s manager, Eddie Howe endured a nailbiting cup tie culminating in a penalty shootout. Thanks to Nick Pope\u2019s excellence it ended well.\nThe England goalkeeper\u2019s saves from Luka Milivojevic, Jean-Philippe Mateta and Malcolm Ebiowei atoned for misses from Sven Botman and Bruno Guimar\u00e3es to send the home side into the fourth round after a 90 minutes in which Marc Gu\u00e9hi and the rest of Patrick Vieira\u2019s back five relished frustrating their hosts.\n\n\u201cWe got through a very difficult, tight game,\u201d said Howe. \u201cThat\u2019s the important thing. I don\u2019t think it was a great performance but Nick Pope is a very commanding figure. He\u2019s a great size and his saves were top-drawer.\u201d\nHowe had earlier been both amused and inspired to learn that Newcastle last won a trophy \u2013 the 1969 Fairs Cup \u2013 before humankind walked on the moon. Neil Armstrong\u2019s pioneering steps were made in July that year, a month after Newcastle overcame Hungary\u2019s Ujpest Dozsa 6-2 on aggregate.\nThe chances of something shiny and new finally being displayed alongside it in the St James\u2019 Park trophy cabinet were enhanced on Wednesday when Newcastle\u2019s Saudi Arabian-led owners revealed they have invested a further \u00a370m in the club, to be divided between infrastructure improvements and player recruitment.\nHowe evidently felt sufficient confidence in his squad to make eight changes to the side who won 4-1 at Southampton on Sunday. Callum Wilson, Newcastle\u2019s first-choice centre-forward, did not even feature on the bench on the eve of an expected call-up to England\u2019s World Cup squad.\n\nWith Chelsea due on Tyneside for a Premier League match on Saturday, Wilson\u2019s in-form fellow forward, Miguel Almir\u00f3n, began on the bench and attracted loud cheers as he took a light jog down the touchline. Howe\u2019s largely second-string XI were starting slowly and looking a little uncertain defensively, with Pope required to make an excellent save to keep a low, left footed shot from Mateta out.\nAlthough Vieira had also heavily reshuffled his team, with Wilfried Zaha and Eberechi Eze not even featuring on the bench, Palace shaded a low-key first half during which a record League Cup attendance at St James\u2019 Park of 51,660 could have done with a bit more entertainment.\nJames Tomkins and Chris Wood combined to very nearly offer them some at the outset of the second half but, although Wilson\u2019s deputy intercepted the Palace defender\u2019s ill-advised back-pass, Sam Johnstone reacted smartly to save Wood\u2019s ensuing shot. Almost immediately, Palace responded. A rapidly counterattacking Jordan Ayew left a trail of home markers in his wake only for the striker\u2019s eventual shot to fly just over the bar.\nAllan Saint-Maximin frequently frustrated Vieira when he played for him at Nice and the Newcastle winger, recently recovered from injury, threatened to further annoy his old manager as his fancy footwork conjured a fine chance ultimately headed into the ground by Dan Burn.\n\nHowe had seen enough and ordered his Brazil midfielder and local cult hero Guimar\u00e3es to prepare to come on alongside Kieran Trippier and Botman in a triple substitution.\nOnce Guimar\u00e3es had seized control of midfield, Almir\u00f3n was also sent on. His arrival coincided with Palace starting to indulge in a little time-wasting, which ultimately succeeded in forcing penalties.\nThe scene was set for Pope\u2019s heroics, and Jordan Pickford\u2019s England international deputy rose to the challenge, in the process offering Gareth Southgate a timely reminder that he is a shootout specialist.\n\u201cIt was a tough one,\u201d said Vieira. \u201cBut we just have to battle on.\u201d"

                    "body": "Countries around the world are pouring funds into new natural gas facilities that could destroy the chances of limiting global heating, in response to soaring energy prices and the war in Ukraine. Governments including the US, Germany, the UK and Canada are investing in new gas production, distribution and use as they seek to sanction Russia over the invasion of Ukraine, according to new research. The findings, from the Climate Action Tracker research initiative, show a dash for gas under way that will lock countries into fossil fuel use at a crucial time, when scientists have warned that a decisive turn towards lower-carbon alternatives within the next few years is the only way to stave off climate breakdown. Niklas H\u00f6hne, of NewClimate Institute, one of the partners behind the Climate Action Tracker, said: \u201cWe\u2019re about to witness a \u2018gold rush\u2019 for new fossil gas production, pipelines and LNG [liquefied natural gas] facilities, locking us into another high-carbon decade.\u201d The report highlighted the US, which has signed a deal to export additional LNG to the EU, through an increased effort on fracking. Germany and Italy have also signed deals with Qatar as a gas supplier, as has Egypt, the host of the world\u2019s next climate summit, Cop27 in Sharm El-Sheikh this November. Canada also plans new LNG production, fast-tracking construction to meet export demand. Overall, fossil fuel production has increased in Canada, the US, Norway, Italy and Japan, according to Climate Action Tracker. The UK is also facing a massive expansion of oil and gas production in the North Sea, as the government has imposed a windfall tax on the industry that contains a loophole encouraging companies to invest in new production. Developing countries are getting in on the act, too. Nigeria is reviving gas pipeline projects that had been shelved, and Senegal and other countries are hoping to explore their gas reserves. Oil and gas companies around the world are enjoying a bonanza after the war in Ukraine sent energy prices \u2013 already rising as the world recovered from the economic shock of Covid-19 \u2013 to fresh highs. The dash for gas comes as scientists have warned it is \u201cnow or never\u201d on the climate. Global greenhouse gas emissions must be halved by 2030, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, to give the world a chance of limiting global temperature rises to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels, the target agreed at last year\u2019s Cop26 climate summit. Some countries have argued that gas production has a role in the transition to a clean energy future, as gas produces less carbon dioxide than coal. But the International Energy Agency warned a year ago that no new oil and gas exploration could take place from this year on, if the world was to limit global heating to 1.5C. Separate research has also found that moving directly to renewable energy from coal is cheaper than using gas as a \u201ctransition\u201d fuel. Bill Hare, chief executive of Climate Analytics, also a partner in the Climate Action Tracker, said the world was compounding the mistake made after the Covid-19 pandemic struck, when despite soaring green rhetoric, few countries made a decisive shift in favour of a low-carbon economic recovery. He warned: \u201cSomething has to change: we cannot go on responding to short-term shocks, be they pandemics or energy shocks from conflict, by taking steps that would increase emissions, ignoring the looming crisis of climate change.\u201d Hare also pointed to the many alternative policies governments should use, such as improving energy efficiency, ramping up renewable energy, boosting public transport and imposing windfall taxes on the bumper profits of fossil fuel companies. These have been largely neglected in many countries, the CAT report warned, which have focused on short-term energy supply responses instead."

Martial made only a second start and sixth appearance in Thursday\u2019s 4-2 Carabao Cup win over Aston Villa, scoring United\u2019s opener for his fourth goal of the season. Ten Hag\u2019s team have managed only 32 goals in 26 games and the manager was asked whether keeping Martial fit was key.  \u201cYes, definitely,\u201d the manager said. \u201cIn the front line, the availability of the players is a concern for us. We have too many games like Newcastle United \u2013 Marcus Rashford is ill then, and we had to play some other games too where we have [to adjust] our offensive line. So if he [Martial] can\u2019t be fit it is really difficult to get in the first four.\u201d Martial has also been injured in previous seasons. \u201cOf course we analyse that \u2013 what can we do to change that,\u201d Ten Hag said. \u201cWe made some measures to do that as it is always when you are often injured \u2013 illnesses too \u2013 there is a reason. Sometimes it is bad luck. He was really in a good way in pre-season and then in last 10 minutes versus Atl\u00e9tico Madrid [in pre-season] he got an injury and that threw him back.\u201d Ten Hag\u2019s other main centre-forward options are Cristiano Ronaldo, who was ill on Thursday, and Rashford but he stated Martial was his preferred choice. \u201cHe plays very well in a lot of aspects of football. I am happy with that, except his availability. But we have others. When we play with Marcus Rashford as the 9 we have a good part of the game.  \u201cWe have Cristiano and we have options there but quite clear to my way of playing, I like a player like Anthony. He can hold the ball, he can finish and is a good presser.\u201d  Jadon Sancho also missed the Villa game because of illness. The winger has been in uneven form, with three goals and an assist in 14 appearances, and was not selected in England\u2019s World Cup squad. \u201cHe was up and down \u2013 some really good performances \u2013 but the last weeks he struggled with illness and then it is normal that you don\u2019t get the nomination,\u201d Ten Hag said. Antony is a doubt for Sunday\u2019s trip to Fulham but Ten Hag said the Brazil winger would \u201cdefinitely not\u201d miss the World Cup. Donny van de Beek made a third consecutive start against Villa and Ten Hag indicated the No 10 would not go on loan in January. \u201cA loan doesn\u2019t make sense. Either he finds himself or he proves himself in this atmosphere or he goes but for me there is still a way for him,\u201d the manager said. \u201cBut it is not going to be easy as the competition here is strong.\u201d"

That pressure could be about to increase.\nAs Russia began its assault on Ukraine, prices rose again. The UK benchmark was up 32% to 281p per therm on Thursday, while the closely watched Dutch future gained 31% on contracts for March delivery. One analyst predicted UK household energy bills could surge past \u00a33000 later this year. So, could Europe\u2019s energy crisis become a catastrophe?\nHow vulnerable are the UK\u2019s gas supplies?\n\u201cWe must collectively cease the dependence on Russian oil and gas that for too long has given Putin his grip on western politics,\u201d Boris Johnson said on Thursday.\nThe good news, for the UK\u2019s security of supply at least, is that less than 5% of our gas comes from Russian imports. About half comes from vast, though rapidly dwindling, North Sea reserves. Another third is sourced from Norway, while the rest comes in via pipelines connecting the UK to Europe, or in the form of liquefied natural gas (LNG), which is transported by tankers typically from Qatar or the US. All of this means, according to a report by the Oxford Institute of Energy Studies, that Britain is \u201cunlikely to face a physical shortage of supplies\u201d.\n\nThe bad news is that Russia typically supplies 30-40% of Europe\u2019s gas, meaning it still wields huge influence over prices, which are already eye-wateringly high. The UK\u2019s market is closely connected to markets in Europe, so a price rise in Germany or the Netherlands means British suppliers must pay more to get hold of it. In January, the US bank Goldman Sachs said it expected gas prices to be twice as high as normal until 2025 and that was before Russia launched its attack on Ukraine. On Thursday, analysts at Investec said they believe the gas and electricity price surge of recent days could force the regulator Ofgem to take the household bills price cap \u201csoaring above \u00a33000\u201d, hot on the heels of this month\u2019s 54% increase to \u00a31971.\nNor can the UK turn to stored reserves of gas for relief from market prices. Storage capacity is very low by international standards since British Gas\u2019s owner, Centrica, shut down the Rough facility off the coast of Yorkshire.\nHow vulnerable are Europe\u2019s gas supplies?\n\nVery. Russian gas flows into Europe via a complex network of pipelines that run through Ukraine, Belarus and Poland to Germany, including Yamal and Nord Stream 1. From Germany, pipelines carry gas to the rest of western Europe and through to the UK.\nIf war in Ukraine were to damage or choke off those supply lines, it could cause severe market volatility and a shutdown of European factories to help conserve gas.\n\u201cIt\u2019s possible to use other routes, particularly the Yamal pipeline through Poland and Germany,\u201d said Michael Bradshaw, professor of global energy at Warwick Business School.\n\u201cBut that depends on Russia being willing to do that.\u201d\nDoes the UK government have a contingency plan?\nSo far, the government has stuck to the line that \u201cthanks to our diverse mix of nuclear, natural gas and renewable technologies, the UK has one of the most reliable energy systems in the world\u201d.\nBut while security of supply does not appear to be at risk, price pressure could have huge ramifications. The efforts of the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, to help households cope with rising costs involves giving them \u00a3200 off their energy bills, with this \u201cloan\u201d paid back at a rate of \u00a340 a year over five years from 2023. The idea is that part of the cost is postponed until markets return to normal. If the Ukraine conflict is prolonged, prices could remain higher for longer, meaning bills will still be high when households have to start repaying the government.\nWhen it comes to securing alternative supplies, LNG from the US and Qatar is one option. Officials were reportedly in talks late last year with Qatar over a deal that could result in the gas-rich nation supplying extra cargoes of gas in the event of an energy emergency, according to the Financial Times. But the government denied requesting that Qatar act as a \u201csupplier of last resort\u201d.\nBradshaw warns that if LNG become a fallback option for Europe and the UK, particularly amid increasing demand for it in Asia, the maths might not add up.\n\n\u201cThe problem might then be that there isn\u2019t enough LNG to make up for shortage of pipeline gas,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re in uncharted territory.\u201d\nHow high could gas prices climb?\nAt 280p per therm, UK short-term gas prices are already more than seven times higher than this time last year and Tom Marzec-Manser, a senior gas expert at ICIS, thinks they could return to the record levels above 450p, reached in December last year.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s unreasonable to believe that gas markets could return to the highs we saw late last year if things were to escalate to the point that gas supplies were affected,\u201d Marzec-Manser said.\nFor now, a few lucky breaks have helped to keep soaring gas markets in check, he added. Gas demand in Asia is lower, which allowed Europe to receive a record number of LNG deliveries from January.\nHowever, a major gas supply disruption could be enough to cause gas prices to soar back to record levels and the weather is always a factor.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to hope we don\u2019t have another cold spell,\u201d said Bradshaw."

                    "body": "I have a shocking admission to make. I am a chess cheat. Or at least world champion Magnus Carlsen would brand me a chess cheat. Occasionally, in online games where I have been testing out particular openings, I have used a chess engine (a dedicated computer program) to look for the best moves to try to get an understanding of positions. Strictly speaking, that is cheating and if the chess platforms on which I play found out, I would be banned. But they never have, because after the first 15 or so moves I abandon the engine and just play on my wits, usually making the litany of blunders for which my chess is noted. Any suspicions anti-cheating systems have about my perfect play up to move 15 are allayed by my decidedly imperfect play over the next 30 or 40. I am a cheat who has got away with it.  The 19-year-old American grandmaster Hans Niemann has not been so fortunate. The world\u2019s biggest chess platform chess.com, which recently bought Carlsen\u2019s Play Magnus company, has exposed Niemann as an online cheat \u2013 it reckons he cheated in more than 100 games.  Niemann has admitted to cheating in online games as a 12- and 16-year-old. Mostly he says they were \u201crandom\u201d games, but money was at stake in some. He had to pay rent and was also keen to win by any means to boost his chess profile and draw people to his internet stream, which he was seeking to monetise. It is all very unedifying, and the world chess governing body, Fide, has convened an inquiry.  There had clearly been gossip in elite chess circles about Niemann\u2019s behaviour because when Carlsen lost to Niemann in an over-the-board tournament last month the world champion immediately withdrew, dropping dark hints that Niemann had been getting computer assistance. Carlsen shared a short clip in which football coach Jos\u00e9 Mourinho says: \u201cIf I speak I\u2019m in big trouble.\u201d His supporters were only too eager to join the dots and accused Niemann of using artificial assistance. Elon Musk, with zero evidence, repeated speculative claims that Niemann might be employing vibrating anal beads to alert him to moves. Niemann countered by offering to play naked. The plot thickened late last month when Carlsen and Niemann played again, this time in an online tournament, and Carlsen resigned after just one move. A few days later, the world champion went public with his suspicions. He said Niemann\u2019s demeanour at the board during their previous encounter had been strange, that he had barely been concentrating, and also drew attention to the \u201cunusual\u201d trajectory of Niemann\u2019s career: he was good but no world-beater in his early teens, an age when most top players are already grandmasters, but has enjoyed a meteoric rise over the past two years. None of Carlsen\u2019s claims, however, would stand up in court. Lots of players behave oddly at the board and don\u2019t appear to be concentrating: the strongest player at my club has been trying to teach the rest of us to look away from the board while playing \u2013 stare at the ceiling instead, he suggests, and try to visualise all the possible moves instead, as Beth Harmon does in The Queen\u2019s Gambit. As for the trajectory of Niemann\u2019s career, well maybe he\u2019s just a late developer. The onus is on Carlsen to produce proof that Niemann is an over-the-board cheat, and he needs to do it soon, because the young American is suffering what former world title contender Nigel Short has called \u201cdeath by innuendo\u201d. How can Niemann, who is currently competing in the US championship, be expected to play well when he is subjected to this kind of pressure? It may be that I am hopelessly naive, but for the moment I am siding with Niemann. Carlsen, whom I once played in a blitz (very short) game that I lost in embarrassing fashion, would perhaps say that cheats stick together. But Niemann was young, rebellious, and says he was living alone and needed money when he cheated online. \u201cThis is the single biggest mistake of my life, and I am completely ashamed,\u201d he says now. I am willing to take him at his word and accept he has learned his lesson. Cheating over the board in elite events is almost impossible. Cheating does occur in big tournaments \u2013 even grandmasters have been exposed \u2013 but it would be incredibly difficult in the rarefied events in which Carlsen and Niemann play. Fields are small and anti-cheating protocols virtually watertight. Even if you got away with it once, you would eventually get found out. Over time, it will become clear how good a player Niemann is and whether the win against Carlsen was a one-off. The bigger picture for chess is an odd one: it may have hit the headlines for all the wrong reasons, but for a sport that has spent the past 40 years in the doldrums the sudden attention is energising. The tousle-haired Niemann is on his way to becoming a global superstar, and chess, we were told in the Guardian this week, is hip and happening. The Guardian reporter even said there were now \u201cchess groupies\u201d, though none has yet made an appearance at Kingston or Surbiton, where I play alongside other ageing aficionados of the 64 squares. Chess is a beautiful game, but for the most part it has not been played by beautiful people. That could, it seems, be about to change, and how bizarre that a cheating scandal may be one factor in bringing it back into the cultural mainstream. The odd couple of Carlsen and Niemann, with a bit of help from Beth Harmon, have made chess fashionable again, and pot-bellied saddos like me, lurking in draughty church halls and the sticky-floored upstairs rooms of pubs, can once more speak openly of our obsession with the Nimzo-Larsen and the G\u00f6ring Gambit. Paradoxically, despite the occasional use of dodgy devices, we are respectable again.

                    "body": "On the plane It looks certain that Jordan Pickford will keep his place as No 1 in Qatar. Southgate has made clear that Kyle Walker is one of the leaders who makes his squad tick and he believes the same of Harry Maguire, even if the boo boys think otherwise. John Stones will also be an influence on and off the pitch. Kieran Trippier is another who has been namechecked as a pillar of the dressing room, and can fulfil both full-back roles. Although Reece James faces a stern battle for the right-back berth, it is inconceivable he will be overlooked for at least a squad spot. Mason Mount looks a guaranteed starter, Southgate having gone out of his way to highlight his importance to England\u2019s pressing game recently. Declan Rice, whose driving runs cannot be replicated, is also sure to travel and Kalvin Phillips can be confident of starting alongside him even if a subpar showing against Hungary is fresh in the memory. Jordan Henderson\u2019s presence was missed over the past fortnight and he will not be overlooked.  Although neither hit form during this month\u2019s Nations League slump, it virtually goes without saying that Harry Kane and Raheem Sterling are nailed-on picks. As Southgate asked last week: where else are England going to find goals? Phil Foden and Bukayo Saka will be asked to help on that front. Foden offers ingenuity that Southgate cannot find anywhere else and the manager sees Saka as a model professional who can contribute in a range of positions, even if the Arsenal winger had clearly run out of steam when the June internationals came around. In the departure lounge Aaron Ramsdale will travel as England\u2019s second keeper unless domestic form deserts him. He impressed against Italy and few can operate comparably with their feet. At the end of last week Nick Pope had expected to play in the home match against Hungary but ended up bereft of Nations League action. He is firmly viewed as No 3 and will hope the spectre of Championship football with Burnley does not complicate his prospects. It was a surprise not to see Conor Coady play at Molineux but he is well-liked in the setup and has a clear edge on the rest of those pushing Maguire and Stones. Luke Shaw and Ben Chilwell will need to prove their fitness but, with England crying out for at least one specialist left-back, Southgate will select both if he can. Trent Alexander-Arnold\u2019s status will be a point of conjecture until the squad is picked: he should squeeze in if, as expected, 26-man parties are permitted but Southgate has clear doubts about selecting a de facto playmaker at right-back within his structure.  Jude Bellingham struggled in both Hungary games but performed with appetite when deployed early on in Germany. Any clamour for him to start in Qatar may have dampened but he looks too lavish a talent to leave at home. So too Jack Grealish, who clearly does not convince his manager as a starter but can shift England through the gears when he comes off the bench and would need a disastrous early-season spell to fade from the picture. Although England do not have a backup striker to compete seriously with Kane, Tammy Abraham is ahead of the rest for that spot. He did not shine against Italy, though, and cannot afford a dip in the new Serie A season. Hoping for a ticket If England travel with five specialist centre-backs then one of Ben White, Marc Gu\u00e9hi and Fikayo Tomori will miss out. It appears a toss-up, although White\u2019s absence from the June camp was unfortunately timed. Tomori may hold a slight edge on Gu\u00e9hi after impressing Southgate against Italy. James Ward-Prowse felt unfortunate to miss the cut for Euro 2020 but looks similarly borderline for Qatar. He did little to move the dial when given a chance against Italy, although Southgate professed himself happy. Conor Gallagher\u2019s energy was particularly apparent early on against Hungary and he could prove a useful, flexible analogue of Mount, but his time may be likelier to come at Euro 2024.  In a shot-shy team there has been plenty of temptation to press Jarrod Bowen\u2019s claim. He offers something different and attractive in attack, but made some poor decisions on the ball during Tuesday\u2019s debacle and still has everything to prove at this level. Emile Smith Rowe will feel he can step back up from the under-21s if he starts the season strongly at Arsenal. There is even more intrigue in the status of Marcus Rashford and Jadon Sancho. Southgate has suggested the Manchester United pair face a long road back into his affections, but Sancho flickered into life towards the end of last season and Rashford would offer proven goal threat to a struggling attack. There may yet be room for one of them. Those travails at the business end mean Dominic Calvert-Lewin and Ollie Watkins will be quietly hopeful of giving Southgate something to ponder during the early weeks of next season. Calvert-Lewin, in particular, has the tools to unseat Abraham. Watching from the sofa Dean Henderson, Sam Johnstone and Fraser Forster may sense vulnerability in Pope\u2019s position but Southgate\u2019s goalkeeping options look set. It is hard to see James Justin building on an iffy debut at Hungary in the near future, especially as alternative picks return to fitness. Now that Tyrone Mings, who had become a stalwart until this month, has been displaced by younger options in Tomori and Gu\u00e9hi he seems unlikely to be tasked with a backup role. Eric Dier would have improved several England sides of the past but apparently not today\u2019s. Kyle Walker-Peters and Tyrick Mitchell will be thwarted by the surfeit of full-back options unless an injury crisis hits.  There is a sense Jesse Lingard\u2019s chance has passed, even if he revives his club career, and Harvey Barnes looks a long way from the sweet spot that might bring a return. Patrick Bamford is miles from the running and the same may apply to Callum Wilson, although the freshlyfit Newcastle man could be an intriguing dark horse for a call from Southgate if he begins next season as he finished 2021-22."

Huddersfield Town will still be smarting as a result of their promotion play-off experience, in which they won two penalties but were not permitted to take either of them. Not allowed. They go again against Burnley, who are now managed by Not Sean Dyche, a fact that will be mentioned in every match report until the turn of the calendar year at the very least, February or March if things go badly for Vincent Kompany. We\u2019re pretty sure the new guy will breeze it, though, on account of his record at Anderlecht, who he took to a couple of third-place finishes in the historical two-horse race of the Belgian league, once a mere 13 points behind a club playing in the top flight for the first time in 48 years. All hail Not Sean Dyche!  Burnley have a tough start, because after that chastening opening-day defeat, they host another defeated play-off outfit in Luton, then travel to Watford the week after. But newly-relegated teams usually bounce back immediately these days. Norwich, past masters of this increasingly tedious state of affairs, begin their latest utterly futile title-winning campaign at Cardiff City, who according to reports will have to somehow accommodate Gareth Bale, 73 and now in possession of a blue badge. And speaking of Qatar\u2019s freshly painted festival of human rights, the season will pause for the best part of a month for it, after which the grind grinds again until early May, presumably no longer featuring Bale, who, having done his bit for the old country in Qatar, will turn his attention to securing a place on the LIV Tour.

The Turkish legend got his revenge early the following season when he was invited back to do the half-time draw.

                    "body": "Over lunch in Hensol on Friday Robert Page could not resist indulging in a replay or two of Gareth Bale\u2019s irresistible free-kick, even if every viewing descended into the pair giggling at the sheer magnificence of it. \u201cI just burst out laughing,\u201d the interim Wales manager says. \u201cHe was laughing about it as well. It is the best free-kick I\u2019ve ever seen in my life \u2026 if he stood in the corner with the ball in his hand, you couldn\u2019t place it any closer into the corner. To do that when the pressure\u2019s on, in a big game, it speaks volumes about him, not only as a player but as a person and as a character.\u201d His character has been lampooned in Spain, the newspaper Marca branding the Wales captain a \u201cparasite\u201d alongside a graphic depicting Bale as an insect sucking blood from the Real Madrid badge on the eve of Thursday\u2019s win over Austria. It perhaps explains why Bale celebrated his two extraordinary goals in Cardiff by repeatedly beating the dragon crest on his shirt. On Friday he took aim in a lengthy social media post at \u201cparasite\u201d journalists, pointing out the damage negative articles can cause and calling for change in the way \u201cwe publicly talk about and criticise people\u201d for not meeting \u201coften unrealistic expectations\u201d.  Bale\u2019s timely masterclass on the pitch makes his exile in Spain all the more mystifying and his agent, Jonathan Barnett, has suggested the 32-year-old\u2019s future will be dictated by whether Wales reach Qatar in November. Page may have been pushing it when saying Bale would walk on broken glass down the M4 to play for Wales but it is impossible to question the forward\u2019s contribution. \u201cHe\u2019s the first one on camp, every camp,\u201d Page says. \u201cHe leads by example. He is a massive part of the culture that Gary [Speed] created and Chris Coleman inherited and built on. \u201cHe is the model professional, and I mean to the nth degree. He looks after what he eats, his sleep, his rest, recovery, that detail. It is no coincidence that he can still deliver performances like that at international level against a top, top team. Players like him can just turn it on when they want and adrenaline would have helped him.\u201d He was not the only one. Aaron Ramsey went the distance on his sixth successive Wales start. Neco Williams, who did not make a league start this season until joining Fulham in February, furrowed with vigour down the left and Joe Rodon put in a gutsy display. He has not been given a Tottenham start since playing Morecambe in January. \u201cHow, after performances like that, I don\u2019t know,\u201d Page says.   A statistic lost amid the celebrations \u2013 strobe lights returned at full time to prolong the party \u2013 is that Wales have not been beaten in Cardiff in 17 games since November 2018. It underlines how tantalisingly close they are to a first World Cup since 1958.  \u201cIt\u2019s lovely to be on Welsh turf,\u201d Connor Roberts said, looking down the camera, before Thursday\u2019s game and Scotland or Ukraine, who will head there in the rearranged playoff final, will do well to cope with another supercharged atmosphere. Austria\u2019s fidgeting players did not know where to look as supporters linked arms for a rousing rendition of Hen Wlad Fy Nhadau. \u201cIt is phenomenal and the supporters have to take a massive amount of credit for that,\u201d Page says of the unbeaten home run. \u201cIt was a hairs-on-the-back-of-your-neck moment again when they were singing the anthem. All right, the luck of the draw has said we\u2019ve got another home draw for the final, which is great, but we won\u2019t just take our foot off the gas now and expect the stat to help us out.\u201d  Some fans were broken by the time Dafydd Iwan performed Yma o Hyd, a patriotic song about survival. A teardrop slowly rolled down Iwan\u2019s cheeks as he pointed towards those in the Canton Stand singing every word back at him. One supporter consoled a blubbering friend but the most apt lasting image is the freeze-frame of Roberts celebrating behind Bale as the four Austria players in the wall, including a wincing Xaver Schlager, hands clasped behind his back, swivel in astonishment, the ball about to nestle in the top corner. That Bale goal felt ridiculous and yet at the same time almost natural. His Wales teammates have come to expect the sublime. It is why they regard free-kicks as penalties. \u201cCheers Gaz,\u201d Roberts said in a tweet. \u201cOne more game.\u201d"

The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) said 25,200 cases of the caffeinated drink, carrying 12 bottles per case, were recalled starting 28 January after glass was detected inside the 13.7oz bottles. That means officials requested more than 300,000 bottles to be returned. Starbucks did not immediately respond to a request for comment from the Guardian. PepsiCo distributes the popular coffee chain\u2019s beverages. The expiration dates for the affected bottles are 8 March, 29 May, 4 June and 10 June, all for this year. Starbucks Vanilla Frappuccinos are not sold in Starbucks stores. But customers can find them at several retail chains across the country, including Walmart, Amazon and Target. The recall was categorized as class two, meaning the affected product \u201cmay cause temporary or medically reversible adverse health consequences or where the probability of serious adverse health consequences is remote\u201d, according to the FDA. The North American Coffee Partnership told Insider that \u201cthe removal of these products from the marketplace is currently under way\u201d. This is the second time since last year that a Starbucks product has been recalled. In August, PepsiCo had to recall 221 cases of Vanilla Espresso Triple Shot drinks in seven states after metal fragments were detected in the products. That recall was labeled class two as well."

The Lionesses are second in the four-team friendly tournament, level on two points with Spain. Canada top the standings having beaten Germany after a 1-1 draw with England.  Wiegman brushed aside concerns about the team\u2019s lack of goals from the front, with the centre-back Millie Bright\u2019s volley England\u2019s only goal of the competition, but she conceded they do need to be more clinical. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t really matter who scored the goals as long as we score a goal,\u201d the manager said. \u201cWe want to do better in the final third and that\u2019s about decision-making, about connection, about scanning the situation and then being ruthless. \u201cSo yes, of course, we want to do a little better because we created lots of chances. We played really well, created those chances and now we want to score them, too, and that\u2019s just the final touch, the hardest thing.\u201d Germany are the highest-ranked team in the competition, at third in the world, but are missing key players, including Wolfsburg\u2019s Almuth Schult, Svenja Huth, Alex Popp and Tabea Wa\u00dfmuth and Olympique Lyonnais\u2019s Dzsenifer Marozs\u00e1n. \u201cThey still have a very strong squad,\u201d Wiegman said. \u201cThey are always a very good team and, even though they are missing very good players ,they still have very good players. We expect a good Germany, a very competitive game with a lot of speed and power, so we\u2019ll be prepared like we were for Canada and Spain.\u201d Wiegman rotated heavily between England\u2019s 1-1 draw with Canada and 0-0 against Spain, making nine changes, and she confirmed she would continue to experiment. \u201cWe want to continue what we were doing but make that even better against another good opponent again. We want to see some slight changes in positions.\u201d  Wiegman has been impressed with how the squad has held up against the toughest challenges faced during her tenure. \u201cI\u2019ve seen a lot from us and the team. When I came in I knew the England squad was very good but it\u2019s even better than I thought. \u201cThe players already have so much experience and there are lots of personalities within the team. How we want to add some things, to get clarity about our style of play and development, is going really well.\u201d"

                    "body": "The first time Ian Burchnall and Graham Potter duelled on the touchline it was for a much-anticipated match between their respective Leeds University and Leeds Metropolitan University teams. Almost two decades on, the pair renew an old rivalry on Wednesday when Potter brings his Brighton side to Forest Green Rovers in the Carabao Cup second round. \u201cThey were always good games,\u201d Burchnall says. \u201cA lot of the other students rock up and it could get a bit lively, because they\u2019ve all been at the SU [student union] bar drinking. Whenever we played Leeds Met we couldn\u2019t get the ball off them and that was Graham training a team twice a week. Even back then you could see his identity.\u201d  Little did either think such a period would kickstart their careers in coaching. Burchnall was 22 and had just finished his sports science degree, his Uefa B licence and was juggling part-time roles coaching Leeds United\u2019s under-nines with working on the club\u2019s community programme, putting on sessions for disadvantaged children and getting results in the British Universities Premier Division North. \u201cAll I wanted was to be able to have one job in football coaching rather than five to try and pay the bills,\u201d he says. \u201cI didn\u2019t think that would be as a manager but it just evolved.\u201d It is why being asked for autographs and photos feels so strange. \u201cYou\u2019re thinking: \u2018Oh my God, really? Are you sure?\u2019\u201d The symmetry between Burchnall and Potter does not end in Leeds. They worked together on the England universities\u2019 football programme through which Burchnall met Kieran McKenna, whose Ipswich side he faced this month, and when Potter left \u00d6stersund for Swansea after an extraordinary seven years in Sweden he recommended Burchnall to Daniel Kindberg, the former \u00d6stersund chairman. Burchnall was viewed as a natural successor and at Forest Green this summer the 39-year-old former Notts County manager was the only person interviewed after Rob Edwards\u2019s exit for Watford. Forest Green commissioned a data report that showed his teams\u2019 xG and possession statistics would suit their style. So how would Burchnall describe his relationship with Potter? \u201cWe\u2019re friends. We don\u2019t ring each other every week but we\u2019ll text each other when things are going well. To be honest, I ask him more for advice than he asks me \u2026 I don\u2019t think he needs me for advice.  \u201cGraham and Billy Reid, his assistant, have been great. I actually moved into Billy\u2019s apartment when I first moved to \u00d6stersund. I needed some advice on the washing machine and he left a few cans of Irn-Bru for me,\u201d he says, breaking into laughter. \u201cFor me it was an impossible job to follow. It was impossible to improve it. It was about rebuilding and trying to keep the club safe in that top league and I did that.\u201d By that point Burchnall had five years in Norway\u2019s top division under his belt, initially as assistant to Brian Deane at Sarpsborg 08 then as head coach at Viking FK. During one international break Burchnall took Viking to \u00d6stersund for a friendly. \u201cWe were 1-0 down at half\u2011time \u2013 and we were a decent team in Norway \u2013 and I just said to Graham: \u2018Any chance of lending us the ball?\u2019 \u201cStyle of play is one thing and coaching is one thing, but Graham\u2019s leadership is top\u2011class and that\u2019s why he\u2019ll end up managing one of the top six or be England manager, 100%.\u201d Burchnall recalls Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r playing his trump card when Molde visited Viking for a league game in 2017. \u201cWe were down to 10 men early, it was 2-2, we were playing a great game and then he brought [Erling] Haaland on for the last 25 minutes and he scored the winner. \u201cI\u2019d seen him a lot at Bryne, where he came through. I was at Viking in Stavanger and Bryne is just up the road, a rival club but a small club. We tried loads of times to take him but he wasn\u2019t interested to come to us because he was playing at Bryne and he had his mates there.  \u201cHis dad, Alfie, is a Bryne guy and I don\u2019t think he wanted him to come to Viking because they\u2019re rivals and there\u2019s a bit of history there. \u201cI remember telling scouts in England about him when he was 15, 16. He didn\u2019t play the first time we played Molde away and I remember speaking to Mark Dempsey [Solskj\u00e6r\u2019s assistant at Molde and now Manchester United\u2019s Under\u201123s coach]. I said to him: \u2018How good is he?\u2019 Demps had been at United for 15 years working in the Under-21s and academy and he went: \u2018Best No 9 I\u2019ve ever seen, by a mile.\u2019 And then he scored the winner against us and I was like: \u2018OK, he\u2019s pretty good.\u2019\u201d Burchnall embraced the culture in Scandinavia \u2013 he had Norwegian and Swedish lessons \u2013 and \u00d6stersund staff were contractually obliged to star in an end-of-season production designed to take everyone out of their comfort zone. Potter sang the Lapland national anthem a cappella and his players performed the ballet Swan Lake. \u201cThere was one scene with Abba, so our lads are dressed as Benny and Bj\u00f6rn,\u201d Burchnall says. \u201cIt\u2019s quite something to get some players who would be shaking and terrified singing initiation songs finishing the year singing in front of 500 people in an auditorium. \u201cFor one part I was dressed as the lead singer of the Sex Pistols; I sang God Save the Queen with a wig and everything \u2026 I\u2019ve come to Forest Green and they explained a few quirky, cultural things and I\u2019m like: \u2018That\u2019s no problem.\u2019\u201d  The climate in Nailsworth is not as harsh as in \u00d6stersund, where temperatures drop to -20C. \u201cThe chairman was like: \u2018We never cancel training for the weather, we go out in the snow, it\u2019s character-building.\u2019 \u201cI remember seeing a coach going out with a pair of Ugg boots on and I\u2019m going: \u2018What are they?\u2019 He\u2019s saying: \u2018You need these to keep your feet dry.\u2019 I went: \u2018Listen mate, I\u2019m a football coach, I\u2019m wearing my Copa Mundials and I\u2019m going out.\u2019 After about two minutes I remember thinking: \u2018Oh my God, I cannot feel my feet, my toes, this is torture.\u2019\u201d Burchnall and Potter exchanged messages when the draw was made and are looking forward to a long overdue catchup. \u201cTo be managing in League One and have a cup game against a Premier League team, it feels like I have done a lot of work to get to this point and hopefully I can still go on further,\u201d Burchnall says. \u201cIt was probably the same for Graham. \u201cSome people think you\u2019ve popped up out of nowhere but it has been 17, 18 years work. It is nice to look back on that and it will be nice to compete again, though it will be a tough game, because they\u2019re pretty good.\u201d"

                    "body": "Gina Rinehart\u2019s Hancock Prospecting has withdrawn a lucrative funding deal from Netball Australia after a players\u2019 revolt against the company. The mining company announced on Saturday that it would withdraw its $15m funding from Netball Australia. It has instead offered short-term funding until the organisation finds a new sponsor. The Diamonds played without Hancock branding in their match against New Zealand this week, despite the sponsorship deal signed last month that was believed to give Hancock uniform branding rights.  That prompted speculation that the players had taken a stand against Hancock Prospecting. The team were reportedly siding with squad member Donnell Wallam, an Indigenous netballer, who had reportedly raised concerns about the company\u2019s record on Indigenous issues. In its statement, Hancock said its partnerships with Netball Australia were based on \u201cthe unwavering enthusiasm that Hancock and its executive chairman for over 30 years have demonstrated for the athletes who proudly represent our nation\u201d. \u201cHancock appreciates Netball Australia\u2019s warm welcome and support, and because of this Hancock and Roy Hill have advised Netball Australia and Netball WA respectively, that it will instead provide a four-month sponsorship should they and their players wish to accept it, to continue funding the athletes and to help netball as it arranges alternative funding and sponsorships,\u201d the statement said.  Sign up for our free morning newsletter and afternoon email to get your daily news roundup  It also said that Hancock and Rinehart considered it \u201cunnecessary for sports organisations to be used as the vehicle for social or political causes\u201d. \u201cFirstly because sport is at its best when it is focussed on good and fair competition, with dedicated athletes striving for excellence to achieve their sporting dreams and to represent our country at their very best,\u201d the company said. \u201cSecondly, because there are more targeted and genuine ways to progress social or political causes without virtue signalling or for self-publicity.\u201d Netball Australia said prior to Sunday\u2019s game that the new squad uniform had been delayed \u201cpending the resolution of outstanding matters relating to the player interim agreement and certain sensitivities\u201d. Netball Australia has suffered losses of more than $7m in two Covid-impacted years. Hancock agreed a $15m sponsorship deal over four years. In its statement, Hancock Prospecting said the sponsorship deal would have increased players\u2019 pay. It also said it did not want to add to \u201cdisunity\u201d within Netball Australia. \u201cHancock and Roy Hill were not made aware prior to the proposed partnerships, of the complexity of existing issues between Netball Australia and the Players Association,\u201d the statement said.  \u201cThis includes the Players Association\u2019s endeavours to gain a very substantial increase in wages during a time the sport is reeling financially, and unable to provide such an increase. \u201cHancock\u2019s proposed sponsorship would have enabled a generous increase in wages for the players which would not have otherwise been possible given netball\u2019s financial situation.\u201d The company also criticised recent media reporting. \u201cSadly, recent media does not help encourage sporting sponsorships,\u201d the company said. \u201cNeither Hancock nor Mrs Rinehart have ever requested or insisted that athletes provide any thank you videos or messages \u2013 although thank you videos and messages have certainly been received. Hancock and Mrs Rineheart would only ever want athletes to wear the Hancock logo if the athletes were proud to do so. \u201cRecent media misreporting has been disappointing, particularly given at no stage did Hancock insist its logo to be worn on the Australian Diamonds\u2019 playing dress for recent games in New Zealand, nor did the Australian Diamonds refuse to wear the Hancock logo.\u201d Rinehart and Hancock sponsor many other sports, including the the Australian Olympic Committee, Volleyball Australia, Rowing Australia, Synchronised Swimming Australia and Swimming Western Australia. Netball Australia has been approached for comment."

                    "body": "British footballers will stage their first on-pitch protest against the effects of gambling harm this weekend, with more than 100 players showing support for a ban on advertising by bookmakers. Players in FA Cup, Scottish Women\u2019s Premier League Cup, Women\u2019s Championship and non-league matches will wear yellow laces as they try to heighten the pressure on government to take action.  The League One side Forest Green will be part of the protest during their FA Cup first-round tie at South Shields, a match being shown live on the BBC. The club\u2019s owner, Dale Vince, said his club were proud to support the initiative, organised by the pressure group The Big Step. \u201cGambling companies are exploiting football and football fans, making huge profits at the expense of people\u2019s lives,\u201d Vince said. \u201cTheir overwhelming presence in our national sport is hyper-normalising an addictive harmful product, with only self-regulation to protect the millions of young fans exposed. This is something Forest Green Rovers stands against. \u201cWe will proudly wear yellow laces this weekend to reinforce our support for the campaign to end all gambling advertising in football.\u201d Also wearing the laces will be Lewes Women, Glasgow City and the men\u2019s non-league sides Dulwich Hamlet, Billericay Town, Llantwit Major, Headingley AFC and, on Tuesday, the Lewes men\u2019s team. League Two Tranmere will warm up in yellow T-shirts before Saturday\u2019s FA Cup first-round match against Carlisle. The Big Step calls for an end to gambling advertising and sponsorship in football, a sport where young fans and viewers can be subjected to more than 700 gambling-related messages during a televised Premier League match. Recent Gambling Commission data showed that while overall levels of participation in gambling had remained stable over the past year, the percentage of 16- to 24-year-olds who identified as problem gamblers had more than trebled. A review of gambling laws was commissioned by the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport in 2020, with a ban on bookmakers\u2019 logos on football shirts one mooted outcome. Two years later a white paper proposing reforms has been delayed four times and is yet to be published. James Grimes, the founder of the Big Step and a former gambling addict, said: \u201cThis weekend is a bold reminder to the government that campaigners for gambling reform and our supportive football clubs are not going away until people can go to a match and support their heroes without being encouraged to gamble.\u201d"

                    "body": "Good morning. Keir Starmer\u2019s policy of ending the VAT exemption for private schools is not all that new, and not all that radical: it\u2019s been Labour policy for five years, Michael Gove suggested the same thing in 2017 (\u00a3), and Gove\u2019s former policy adviser Sam Freedman says that a tiny number of independent schools would be threatened by the change. It\u2019s a popular, progressive idea, but it\u2019s not going to transform the UK\u2019s education system. It has, nonetheless, come under furious attack. First, the Daily Mail conjured two front pages about it from thin air. Then Starmer leaned into the row by bringing it up at prime minister\u2019s questions. This weekend, the furore reached its predictable zenith: a search for hypocrisy on Starmer\u2019s part by the Mail on Sunday. The resulting story felt, in all honesty, pretty thin: Starmer sends his children to \u2026 state school. But that school, in the Mail on Sunday\u2019s telling, is a \u201cstate-run prep school for the middle class\u201d. Gotcha! The thing is: cartoonish though the Mail on Sunday\u2019s account was, there is something complicated, and important, here. Starmer has every right to send his kids to the outstanding primary in question, Eleanor Palmer, having lived a stone\u2019s throw away since 2004 \u2013 but it\u2019s also true that the better it\u2019s done by its disadvantaged pupils, the fewer of them there have been. Today\u2019s newsletter, with Lee Elliot Major, a leading expert on education and social mobility and a former Eleanor Palmer parent, is about what the story of one school has to tell us about the vexed question of what middle-class parents owe to their own children, and to everybody else. Here are the headlines. Five big stories  Housing | Rishi Sunak is to drop compulsory housebuilding targets to see off an embarrassing backbench rebellion, prompting criticism he is putting party unity above the national interest. Around 100 Tory MPs had threatened to back an amendment rejecting the 300,000 homes a year target. Strikes | Hopes of a deal to avert severe Christmas rail disruption were dashed on Monday night when the RMT union announced additional strike dates and rebuffed a pay offer from Network Rail just before the industry\u2019s deadline. Politics | Matt Hancock has claimed that the Conservative peer Michelle Mone pressured him using \u201cextraordinarily aggressive\u201d lobbying tactics for a company bidding to supply Covid tests during the pandemic. Monarchy | A black British charity leader who was asked where she \u201creally came from\u201d by an aide at a Buckingham Palace royal reception has said she has suffered \u201chorrific abuse\u201d on social media. Ngozi Fulani said that she and her family had felt \u201cimmense pressure\u201d since the incident. Television | Kirstie Alley, the TV and film star known for her roles in Cheers, Veronica\u2019s Closet and Look Who\u2019s Talking, has died at the age of 71. Ted Danson, her co-star in Cheers, called her \u201ctruly brilliant\u201d.  In depth: \u2018An amazing school on our doorstep\u2019  Lee Elliot Major is the former chief executive of education charity the Sutton Trust, the UK\u2019s first professor of social mobility, and holder of an OBE. When he moved to Tufnell Park \u2013 the neighbourhood of Starmer\u2019s Holborn and St Pancras constituency where Eleanor Palmer is based \u2013 in 2003, he was none of those things. \u201cWe were part of that last generation who didn\u2019t have high salaries but could just about get a house somewhere like that,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd then we realised there was this amazing school on our doorstep.\u201d Eleanor Palmer has been an amazing, and popular, school for years. Before the current top designation of \u201coutstanding\u201d was introduced in 2005, it got a 2002 report (PDF) that called it a \u201cgood and effective school that gives good value for money\u201d. After the 2003 arrival of a universally praised head teacher, Kate Frood, a 2011 inspection (PDF) graded it as outstanding, exempting it from further inspections, and approvingly quoted a parent\u2019s summary: \u201cEleanor Palmer is an absolutely wonderful school \u2013 warm, nurturing, extremely well led and managed, with excellent teaching and a very inclusive ethos.\u201d As well as its results, this farewell video put together for Frood\u2019s retirement in 2021 suggests what a wonderful place it obviously still is. I lived nearby until recently and would regularly walk past \u201cKate Gate\u201d, pictured above, which was installed for the same occasion and urges pupils: \u201ctake risks\u201d, \u201cpersevere\u201d, \u201cdon\u2019t be late\u201d, and \u201cinclude everyone\u201d. *** How the school changed: \u2018sharp-elbowed warriors\u2019 The story of Tufnell Park since Elliot Major arrived there is a microcosm of London in the same period: unrelenting gentrification, with mixed consequences for the disadvantaged residents who remain. As you would expect, that change was visible in Eleanor Palmer, too. In 2002, about one-third of pupils were eligible for free school meals; by this year, that figure had dropped to 16%, against a nationwide total of 23%. Elliot Major\u2019s children arrived there in the late 2000s. \u201cAs an older cohort, we were aware that the nature of the school was fundamentally shifting,\u201d he said. \u201cYou could see it. There was a close-knit community, all down the local pub together \u2013 it was a lovely time in our lives. And then that sense of community did not quite seem to be there in the same way.\u201d One measure of the increased competition for places: in 2010, the school had to move the point from which the catchment area was measured (\u00a3) from the school gates to the centre of the playground after complaints that some applicants were gaining an unfair advantage. A new cohort, who Elliot Major describes as \u201csharp-elbowed warriors obsessed with getting the best education for their children\u201d, were ready to take extreme measures to secure a place. In 2013, the Evening Standard reported that disappointed parents were aggrieved at being beaten to a spot by others who had temporarily rented nearby accommodation \u2013 a phenomenon I experienced personally when, lacking the offspring to capitalise on my own proximity, I received two unsolicited but lucrative offers from would-be parents to temporarily rent my flat. (Fearing a lifetime of shame when going past the school gates, I said no.) In 2014, Kate Frood described this phenomenon as \u201cannoying\u201d; I\u2019ve heard an Eleanor Palmer teacher use riper language than that. In 2015, Times columnist and local resident Giles Coren \u2013 pictured here judging an Eleanor Palmer baking contest two years earlier \u2013 wrote a frothingly angry piece decrying the \u201clying, cheating, hypocritical, Guardian-reading, middle-class, north London, Corbynite scum\u201d renting nearby and forcing him to send his daughter private. \u201cA lot of the community took real umbrage at that,\u201d Elliot Major said. \u201cOther people didn\u2019t have that same option if they didn\u2019t get in.\u201d *** What the changes meant for the children who didn\u2019t get in On one level, the consequences for the disadvantaged children who might once have attended schools like Eleanor Palmer are obvious: fewer of them get in, and so fewer of them get places at an outstanding school. But it\u2019s complicated. \u201cYou have to remember with this debate that a lot of good results at highly popular \u2018destination\u2019 state schools are down to the children that go there in the first place,\u201d Elliot Major said. \u201cA lot of the variation is down to the home environment.\u201d Some argue that sharp-elbowed parents can help raise standards for everyone, not just their own kids. As Frood said in that 2014 interview, Eleanor Palmer has \u201ca critical mass of high-achieving \u2026 middle-class kids \u2013 so all my working-class or refugee kids get caught up\u201d. On the other hand, Elliot Major said, \u201cone of the quandaries in the research is that in some high-performing schools, poorer children don\u2019t do that well. It may be that mixed schools are more expert in helping children from disadvantaged backgrounds. \u201cWhat you want, in the end, is more mixed schools, and mixed communities, where everyone benefits,\u201d Elliot Major said. \u201cThat\u2019s how you get real social mobility.\u201d *** What privileged parents owe their schools Elliot Major is not surprised at the attacks on Starmer: \u201cTaking on the private school sector is always going to generate a backlash,\u201d he said. And, honestly, it looks pretty hard to justify in this case. Starmer lives so close to Eleanor Palmer, and has been a resident for so long, that the only functional argument against his children\u2019s right to a place there is to say that they should be forcibly sent to private school to free up spots for others. At the same time, Elliot Major said: \u201cThere is a lot of hypocrisy among liberal elites on this subject. People use their money in different ways to stay ahead, and buying a house is a way of doing that. We\u2019re all hypocrites to some extent \u2013 I\u2019ve paid for tutoring for my own children. You have to be really careful about judging people.\u201d In the end, he says, the best a school with little control over its composition can hope for is \u201cgenuinely reflecting the community, and having parents who are committed to that. One thing we see in some of these cases is very individualistic behaviour, where parents are not necessarily interested in the school community as a whole \u2013 they just want to know how it will help their child.\u201d *** How to fix the bigger problem Castigating the Labour leader for sending his children to their local school seems unlikely to do very much for the education system; nor does the marginal measure of charging VAT on private school fees. But more radical steps seem a long way off. One suggestion to help close the attainment gap between rich and poor, from the Association of School and College Leaders last year, is to ringfence places for disadvantaged pupils who live further away from oversubscribed schools. Elliot Major takes a similar view: \u201cWe have to do more to challenge this situation \u2013 prioritising [disadvantaged] pupils in the admissions process, or having lotteries for places.\u201d In the end, though, there is a bigger picture, perhaps illustrated by the expectation that, even if Keir Starmer\u2019s children hadn\u2019t been entitled to a place at Eleanor Palmer, they would have been absolutely fine. \u201cI know kids who went there who haven\u2019t gone on to university, who haven\u2019t had those chances,\u201d Elliot Major said. \u201cWe don\u2019t do well enough by those children. That\u2019s the problem that gnaws away at me.\u201d What else we\u2019ve been reading   Who doesn\u2019t love a cheesy made-for-TV Christmas film?

                    "body": "TUNNEL VISION\nYou probably haven\u2019t heard of Marcel Ries, the Lausanne-based metalsmith who since 2009 has been tasked with engraving the winner\u2019s name on to major Uefa trophies in the moments after the final whistle blows, while someone charges the glitter-cannons and the victors prepare to hoist their freshly personalised pot aloft. Perhaps it was to Ries that Uefa turned on Tuesday, to find out if he is as adept with the Tipp-Ex brush (ask your grandparents) as he is with an engraving pen, and as efficient at taking names off stuff as he is at indelibly adding them.\nIt is curious that Uefa, in contrast to the other major Swiss institution Guardian readers have been reading about this week, are so very keen on publicly putting names on everything. But though it insisted on Tuesday that \u201cat present there are no plans to change the venue\u201d, it might at this point be regretting the decision to emblazon the name of St Petersburg, the city whose Gazprom Arena the Gazprom-sponsored organisation for some reason chose to host the 2022 Big Cup final, on every single ball used in the competition this year.\n\nWhatever its statements say, Uefa is universally predicted to eventually conclude that, as tousle-haired party organiser Boris Johnson put it a little earlier, \u201cit is inconceivable that major international football tournaments can take place in Russia\u201d. Such news will be particularly, and in numerous ways, deflating for these suddenly obsolete balls, who will have to take their thermal bonding, rhombus carcasses and high-grade butyl bladders to the nearest discount bin. Meanwhile it might be time to order a few official Road to Saint Petersburg 22 skips in which to dump the enormous quantity of suddenly obsolete stickers, signage and even bespoke tunnel carpets the continent\u2019s leading clubs are about to have on their hands. Perhaps it is even time to accept that the need for bespoke tunnel carpets is not as great as it once appeared.\nLater on Tuesday, eyes turn to Villarreal and Chelsea, hosts of the evening\u2019s two last-16 games, to see quite how much of this signage has already been quietly cupboarded. Thomas Tuchel\u2019s European champions host Lille, currently 11th in Ligue 1, with Romelu Lukaku the focus of particular attention after his anonymous performance in Saturday\u2019s win over Crystal Palace, in which he touched the ball only seven times, one of those from kick-off. \u201cIt\u2019s of course not what we want,\u201d Tuchel said, \u201cbut it\u2019s also not the time to laugh about him, make jokes about him.\u201d Have no fear, Thomas \u2013 this is The Fiver, there\u2019s absolutely no chance of that.\nLIVE ON BIG WEBSITE\nJoin Scott Murray at 8pm (GMT) for hot Big Cup MBM coverage of Chelsea 2-0 Lille, while Barry Glendenning will be on hand for Villarreal 1-1 Juventus.\nQUOTE OF THE DAY\n\u201cIn life our ego can kill us more than help us.

Given the winner of that tie would play Spurs for a place in the group stages of Tin Pot, it\u2019s now gutting to think that the worst performance of six games on our European journey stopped us from witnessing Spurs in all their Spurs-iness at close quarters. By the way, Aarhus were not happy at losing\u201d \u2013 Bryce Brennan.\n\u201cWhile not letting the fact that it isn\u2019t really that central get in the way, I have long thought that the Aarhus tourist board have missed a trick not bringing Madness in to sell the town.

                    "body": "Good morning. As Britain prepares to flood to the pubs and the parks to enjoy the blue, cloudless skies and catch some rays, it\u2019s hard to ignore the troubling implications of heatwaves that constantly break records. The problem isn\u2019t that yesterday was the hottest day of the year, or that today looks like being, too: the problem is that days like these used to be rare, and now they aren\u2019t. The pattern of this week\u2019s weather is being repeated in many parts of the world, but the outcomes can be significantly more extreme: in the US extreme heat is the leading cause of weather related death. It\u2019s also having a deadly effect on livestock in Kansas, one of the country\u2019s top three producers of beef, as the state reports 2,000 cattle dead. And the climate crisis will only continue exacerbate the sweltering temperatures, and make them come more often. Below, Archie Bland and I take a look at the impacts of extreme heat on five different cities. First though, the headlines. Five big stories  Economy | The Bank of England has raised interest rates to 1.25% to tackle inflation and the cost of living crisis, the fifth month in a row the bank has raised the rate.  Conservatives | Boris Johnson is considering scrapping the role of ethics adviser after the resignation of Lord Geidt from the role. The PM\u2019s spokesperson said Johnson would not immediately start looking for a replacement, but would instead review the system of enforcing the ministerial code. Brazil | The family of Dom Phillips have spoken of their heartbreak over the murder of the British journalist and the Indigenous activist Bruno Pereira as colleagues said the men\u2019s work would be an inspiration to others. Gymnastics | British Gymnastics enabled a culture where young gymnasts were starved, body shamed and abused in a system that ruthlessly put the pursuit of medals over the protection of children, a devastating report has found. Espionage | A Russian spy tried and failed to secure an internship at the international criminal court (ICC) using the false identity of a Brazilian citizen that he had built up over more than a decade, Dutch intelligence said. Sergey Vladimirovich Cherkasov is accused of being an agent of Russia\u2019s GRU.  In depth: From Arizona to Pakistan, humans are feeling the heat  With every passing year, understanding the effect of extreme heat becomes more relevant to more people. Researchers who used to focus on the victims of nuclear power station disasters or distance runners in the Sahara are now shifting to ordinary people in previously temperate environments; the BBC is running explainers on ways to stay safe in extreme hot weather and warning of the risks of heat exhaustion. But for all these universal consequences, the climate crisis is felt in specific ways depending on where you are \u2013 and its impacts are doled out unevenly. Here are a few examples of the consequences of extreme weather patterns that have been felt across the world in recent days: *** London, UK | 29.3C yesterday While a great deal of coverage of good weather in the UK dwells - understandably - on beaches and ice cream, the growing health risks associated with historically abnormal temperatures are real. The UK Health Security Agency has issued several heat health alerts covering much of England for Friday, warning that the elderly and people with chronic health conditions are particularly at risk. 3,000 \u2018excess deaths\u2019 were linked to heatwaves in the UK in heatwaves between 2016 and 2019. And while the 34C that is expected in the south east tomorrow - and the 29C in London today - are not unprecedented temperatures, that 34C level has been reached three times in the last six years - a consistency that alarms climate scientists. *** Doha, Qatar | 44C yesterday If common sense hadn\u2019t prevailed and prompted a shift to a winter tournament, the World Cup would have begun last Friday in Qatar \u2013 when the temperature hit 49C, only 0.3C from the June record. Yesterday, the high in Doha was 44C, compared to a historic June average of 41.7C. Recent legislation has greatly expanded rules prohibiting outdoor work in the middle of the day, a response to intense criticism over the number of migrant workers dying due to heat stress. But there are still concerns about cases where those rules are ignored in ways that marry the demands of the on-demand economy with rising temperatures. On Wednesday, for example, Doha News reported that delivery drivers are (illegally) being given only the \u201coption\u201d not to work between 10 and 330, but feel they have no choice \u2013 because most orders come at lunchtime, when nobody wants to go outside to get their own food. *** Jacobabad, Pakistan | 45C yesterday On 14 May, the temperature in Jacobabad hit 51C, making it the hottest city in the world at the time. A summer season that used to begin in May now begins in March. Last month, Rahmat Tunio reported on the consequences of that change for a city of 300,000. Hospitals are being overrun with heatstroke patients, huge crowds go to cold-water stations, and those who can afford to are moving away; trees which used to provide shade have mostly been cut down and sold or used as fuel. \u201cThe heat is becoming unbearable,\u201d said Muhammad Akbar, who sells dried chickpeas and has suffered heatstroke three times. \u201cI\u2019m scared that this heat will take our lives in the coming years.\u201d  *** Seville, Spain | 42.4C on Wednesday Swathes of southern France and Spain have been enduring the second extreme heat event of the year, with temperatures that aren\u2019t usually experienced until July or August already hitting; it is Spain\u2019s most extreme June heat in 20 years. Seville has regularly been hitting highs above 40, against an average maximum at this time in June of around 33C, according to data provided by Metdesk. Last year, the city became the first to start naming and ranking its heat waves, treating them like tropical storms and hurricanes as a way to raise public awareness of the danger they pose and how to prepare for them better. *** Phoenix, Arizona | 44C yesterday A heat dome has formed over the western part of the US this week, and one of the hardest hit states has been Arizona. Even at midnight, temperatures were still hitting 38C in the state\u2019s capital, Phoenix. To the dismay of residents in the city, the temperature has not dropped past 27C for over a week. Yesterday, the mercury hit 44C, bringing a severe weather warning. But it\u2019s not just about the highs \u2014 the hot season is starting earlier, finishing later and the frequency of dangerously hot days are increasingly common. As higher temperatures reduce moisture in arable land, wildfires not only become more common they become more severe. Earlier this week one broke out in Flagstaff and within a day more than 24,000 acres had been burnt to the ground. To try to deal with the problems caused by extreme heat, the city has appointed a dedicated heat tsar (although there isn\u2019t a dedicated budget for it yet.) What else we\u2019ve been reading: the journalism of Dom Phillips  With the terrible news about Dom Phillips and Bruno Pereira confirmed, we thought it was a good time to look back on Phillips\u2019 journalism \u2013 and his dedication to the environmental harm being done in his adopted homeland of Brazil. That damage was only accelerated by the election of Jair Bolsonaro as president, something Dom had warned about before his victory. Dom was a big part of revealing the links between JBS, the world\u2019s biggest meat company, and Amazon deforestation in an investigation by the Guardian, the Bureau of Investigative Journalism and R\u00e9porter Brasil, and Greenpeace and Amnesty International: \u201cthe evidence raises serious questions about JBS\u2019s review of its own complex supply chain, at a time when the Brazilian government is being taken to task by international investors over rising deforestation and fires\u201d. It was a subject he would return to, together with Michael Standaert in China, as Dom drew attention to the ever-growing appetite for beef and how it was driving the environmental crisis in the Amazon: \u201cRavenous demand from China has helped Brazilian beef sales rocket to record levels \u2013 but the boom comes at a high environmental cost \u2026 the country is the world\u2019s biggest beef exporter.\u201d But he was also committed to finding the positive stories out of Brazil too, such as the thriving sustainable agriculture enterprises being explored in the country: \u201cThe culture here is slash and burn, and we\u2019re trying to change that,\u201d Scannavino Netto says. And this unforgettable piece about indigenous fishermen is testament to the work Dom will be remembered for, in which he talked about the threat to the Brazilian government\u2019s indigenous agency, Funai, which Bruno Pereira worked for: \u201cMonths earlier, a Funai team were shot at by another group of fishermen. Agency staff are not normally armed, nor do they have clear rules on arrests. \u2018It is dangerous to go after fishermen or hunters who are armed and in teams of six people,\u2019 de Souza says.\u201d  Sport Football | A volley from Rachel Daly and two own goals ensured England eventually eased past Belgium in the first of their three pre-Euros friendlies. Manager Sarina Wiegman demanded more ruthlessness from her team. Football | The French official investigating the Champions League final chaos in Paris in which Liverpool fans were teargassed admitted there were \u201cmany regrets\u201d over what happened. But Michel Cadot told France\u2019s senate that preparations had been robust. Golf | Four time major champion Rory McIlroy played an almost perfect game for the first six holes but McIlroy also showed some serious anger after he smashed a bunker at the 5th before saving par. Canadian golfer Adam Hadwin sat at the leaderboard\u2019s summit at minus four. The front pages  The Guardian print edition leads with \u201cJohnson may scrap role of ethics adviser after Geidt\u2019s resignation\u201d while the Financial Times has \u201cUkraine\u2019s drive to join EU gains impetus from European leaders\u201d.

Bye!      4.17pm    And the player of the match is\u2026      4.03pm     And since you asked, here\u2019s Alex Ferguson\u2019s record in his first 24 league games: W10 D8 L6 Pts 38.  Updated at 4.06pm GMT    3.57pm    Still want more? Course you do.       3.55pm   Full time: Man Utd 3-0 Leicester City  An imaginative chip from Bruno Fernandes lands on the roof of the net, and that\u2019s the end of an ultimately comfortable victory for Manchester United.  Marcus Rashford continued his volcanic streak with two more goals, and the substitute Jadon Sancho \u2013 who played superbly in the No10 role \u2013 added a lovely third. Leicester were the better team in the first half, even though they were 1-0 down, but United romped to victory after the break.     3.52pm    90+2 min Maddison\u2019s long-range shot is held to his right by de Gea. The victory looks comfortable now, but United needed to outstanding stops from de Gea at 0-0.     3.51pm    90+2 min \u201cWhat a joy it is to see Marcus Rashford looking like the player he can be again,\u201d says Tom Hopkins. \u201cHim and Saka rampaging down the wings for England for the foreseeable future is a mouthwaterer.\u201d You say \u2018again\u2019, and I know what you mean, but I\u2019m not sure he\u2019s ever been this good. He had periods of being United\u2019s talisman, particularly before Bruno Fernandes arrived, but there\u2019s a ruthlessness to his finishing that I can\u2019t recall seeing in the past.     3.50pm    90 min Elanga\u2019s shot from a tight angle is saved with his legs by Ward. Four minutes of added time.  Updated at 3.50pm GMT    3.49pm    89 min Weghorst plays a fine reverse pass to Sancho on the left side of the area. He turns and finds Fernandes, whose attempted lay-off to Weghorst is cut out.     3.48pm    89 min Jadon Sancho\u2019s best position is No10, discuss.     3.48pm    88 min: Great chance for Weghorst! The big man should have scored his first Premier League goal for United. McTominay played a good ball to find Sancho in space between the lines. He ran at a backpedalling defence and timed a through ball perfectly for Weghorst, whose low shot was saved by the legs of Ward. It was a good save, but he should have scored.     3.46pm    87 min Three of United\u2019s next four league games are tough away fixtures \u2013 Liverpool, Brighton and Newcastle. If they win all three, they\u2019ll be well and truly in a title race.     3.45pm    83 min \u201cCheers for the viewing tip,\u201d says Simon McMahon. \u201cAfter what happened at Tannadice yesterday with our centre half and Mr In Between (the sticks), I\u2019m all about Ac-Cent-Tchu-Ateing the positive this weekend.\u201d Oh my word, this is outstanding.      3.43pm    83 min Praet\u2019s shot deflects behind. The match is starting to peter out.     3.40pm    80 min: United substitution The crowd are enjoying a bit of ol\u00e9 football. Meanwhile, the 17-year-old Kobbie Mainoo makes his Premier League debut, replacing Marcel Sabitzer. Seventeen years old.     3.36pm    77 min Here\u2019s the league table as things stand.      3.35pm    76 min: Double substitution for Leicester Dennis Praet and Jamie Vardy, whose introduction leads to chants of \u201cJamie Vardy, your wife is a grass\u201d, replace Kelechi Ihenacho and Tete.     3.34pm    75 min \u201cWhen we talk about players we think well he failed because of manager/tactics etc,\u201d says Yash Gupta. \u201cBut we ignore one important factor - rehabilitation after injury and being gradually introduced into the team. Rashford last season was injured at the beginning of the season and was then rushed back. \u201cOle was under pressure so he did what he did best - running players into the ground. In Rashford\u2019s case that meant no gradual reintegration which resulted in setback and confidence loss, more small injuries and whole season was wasted. This season he\u2019s fit again, not just physically but mentally as well and he looks a proper player again. Who knew players after injury need time!\u201d I agree totally about rehab, though I\u2019d say it\u2019s a bit harsh on Solskjaer \u2013 I think Rashford only started three games under him last season. It is interesting how untimely injuries can derail a career, even if the player isn\u2019t out for that long. Wayne Rooney was never quite the same player after he went through a sliding door in Munich in March 2010.  Updated at 3.34pm GMT    3.32pm    73 min Castagne makes a crucial interception to stop Weghorst scoring (probably) from Wan-Bissaka\u2019s low cross.     3.31pm    71 min Fernandes\u2019s free-kick is headed wide from 14 yards by the stretching Weghorst. It was a pretty decent effort, but the ball swerved wide of the far post.     3.30pm    70 min: Chance for Sancho! Weghorst plays a fine reverse pass to put Sancho through on goal. He slides a shot across goal that is superbly blocked by the stretching Faes, then volleys the rebound into orbit.     3.29pm    69 min: Double substitution for United Anthony Elanga and Aaron Wan-Bissaka replace Marcus Rashford and Luke Shaw, two key players for the upcoming games against Barcelona and Newcastle.     3.26pm    67 min Leicester were terrific in the first half but United have been even better in the second. Erik ten Hag really has done a remarkable job, which is why I\u2019m remarking upon it.     3.25pm    65 min Jadon Sancho looks a really interesting option at No10: technically excellent, comfortable in tight areas, low heart rate.     3.23pm    63 min United are flying now. Luke Shaw dances infield, all the way to the edge of the area before dragging a right-footed shot that is comfortably held to his right by the falling Ward.     3.22pm    That was an Ajax goal. Martinez bullied Iheanacho off the ball on the halfway line \u2013 Leicester thought it was a foul \u2013 with Rashford collecting the loose ball. He moved it forward to Sancho, just outside the D, and he played in the unmarked Fernandes on the right side of the area. Fernandes shaped to shoot and then returned it to Sancho, who tapped it gleefully into the open net.   Updated at 3.27pm GMT    3.21pm   GOAL! Man Utd 3-0 Leicester (Sancho 62)  What a beautiful goal!   Updated at 3.32pm GMT    3.21pm    60 min This is turning into one of the great feelgood stories. Last season he scored five goals and looked like somebody who loathed football. This season he has 24 goals!     3.19pm    59 min: Double substitution for Leicester Youri Tielemans and Boubakary Soumare replace Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall and Nampalys Mendy.     3.18pm    59 min: United substitution Scott McTominay replaces Fred, whose last act was to make that second goal.     3.18pm    What a season he is having. It was a really smooth move from United: Martinez into Fred, who took a touch and slid the ball behind the defence. Rashford\u2019s pace took him away from Souttar, and then he slid the ball through Ward\u2019s legs.     3.17pm   GOAL! Man Utd 2-0 Leicester (Rashford 58)  The goal is given!     Updated at 3.34pm GMT    3.17pm    57 min: Rashford has a goal disallowed for offside! Fred played him through in the inside-left channel, and the rest was a formality, but the flag went up as soon as the ball hit the net. It\u2019ll be checked by VAR. It\u2019s tight but I think he\u2019s just offside.  Updated at 3.17pm GMT    3.16pm    56 min Scott McTominay, who has been out for three weeks through injury, is about to come on.     3.15pm    55 min \u201cIs it unreasonable to suggest that Sabitzer should have seen red simply because of the intent?\u201d says Stephen Carr. \u201cContact seems irrelevant in this context. That was a nasty one.\u201d  No, not at all \u2013 if they thought it was deliberate, he would (should) have been sent off. Cristiano Ronaldo was sent off at City in 2006 when he fresh-aired a flying tackle on Andy Cole. Graeme Souness thought Sabitzer meant it. I\u2019m not sure \u2013 the one thing I can\u2019t reconcile is why a player would take such a risk when VAR is in use. It\u2019s not 1984 anymore.     3.15pm    54 min Dalot surges infield again and finds Fernandes on the right of the area. His deep cross is headed back across goal by Fred towards Weghorst, eight yards out by facing away from goal. Weghorst goes down in instalments and blooters overhead kick into the Stretford End. He has plenty of virtues, but elegance and athleticism are not among them.     3.13pm    53 min Maddison\u2019s free-kick hits the wall. Souttar heads the rebound back to Maddison, who slices a shot so badly that it stays in play on the far side. The bounce made it a very difficult ball to hit.     3.12pm    52 min Sabitzer fouls Maddison just outside the area, to the left of centre. I think we know who\u2019ll take this\u2026     3.11pm    50 min: Chance for Rashford! Tete gives the ball away to Sabitzer, who releases Rashford on the left. He surges infield, beating Souttar and Dewsbury-Hall with ease on the edge of the area, but then throttles a drive straight at Ward. He blocks the shot with his left knee, a slightly perculiar but ultimately effective, and moments later Fernandes has a stinging volley well blocked.     3.09pm    50 min Fernandes works Ward with a left-footed shot from 25 yards. A comfortable save.     3.09pm    50 min United have started the second half really well. Weghorst\u2019s shot from the edge of the area spins behind off Souttar. Shaw\u2019s corner is headed away.     3.08pm    49 min: Martinez hits the bar! Shaw curls a delicious free-kick onto the head of Martinez, who powers a header over Ward and off the top of the crossbar. That was a great chance.     3.07pm    48 min Mendy is booked for a foul (sic) on Rashford. I\u2019m not sure it was a free-kick.  Updated at 3.07pm GMT    3.06pm    46 min Dalot turns Kristiansen inside out and flashes a superb cross that is put behind by Castagne.     3.05pm    46 min Leicester begin the second half. United have made a half-time substitution: Jadon Sancho for the ineffectual Alejandro Garnacho. That means a few positional changes \u2013 Weghorst up front, Rashford left wing, Sancho as the No10.  Updated at 3.05pm GMT    3.03pm    \u201cIs United\u2019s tawdry summer transfer business (which cost them in the first two games) going to end up becoming one of the great big ifs?\u201d wonders Digvijay Yadav. \u201cGet business done quick and United would\u2019ve been right in amongst them.\u201d I suppose there\u2019s an argument that they needed the shock of that Brentford shambles to snap everyone into action \u2013 the enough\u2019s enough moment, like Middlesbrough in December 1998 or Manchester City in November 2002.  Updated at 3.04pm GMT    3.01pm    \u201cLeicester City had top-class glovesmen for quite a long time: the true greats Banksie and Shilts, then later Mark Wallington and Ian Walker who were well thought of,\u201d says Jeremy Boyce. \u201cAfter that there were good keepers \u2013 Tim Flowers, Kasey Keller - and eventually the other great, Kasper Schmeichel, but none of the latter three came through the production line. What happened ? Opening up the league to overseas players ? Something they stopped putting in the school lunches in the Leicester area? I\u2019m sure Danny Ward is a perfectly competent goalminder, but if you ever saw Banksie (I saw him once live) you\u2019d have to say he was an artist just like his latter day namesake, and worth far more.\u201d Maybe it\u2019s time to start trying outfield players in goal.      2.58pm    Graeme Souness, a leading expert in the field of studs-up challenges, thinks Sabitzer should have been sent off for that tackle on Faes. \u201cI don\u2019t care what some referee who has never played the game thinks. If that\u2019s not dangerous play, what is? He\u2019s turned side-on \u2013 ask any professional footballer, that\u2019s a classic case of setting yourself up to do someone.\u201d        2.49pm   Half time: Man Utd 1-0 Leicester City  United lead through another ruthless finish from Marcus Rashford, but the scoreline flatters them a touch. Leicester were the smoother side, with James Maddison to the fore, and David de Gea had to make two seriously good saves to deny Harvey Barnes and Kelechi Iheanacho.   Updated at 2.50pm GMT    2.48pm    45+2 min Faes is booked for an absurd lunge at Fernandes.     2.46pm    45+1 min After a poor ball from Fred, Maddison cracks a drive wide of the near post from 22 yards. De Gea had it covered.     2.46pm    45 min Two minutes of added time. United have been a bit more comfortable defensively in the last 15 minutes or so, though Leicester do still look dangerous.     2.45pm    44 min Weghorst declines the opportunity to put Garnacho through on goal. He thought Garnacho was offside, but Gary Neville, commentating on Sky, thinks Faes was playing him on.     2.42pm    41 min Fred flattens his teammate Rashford with an errant long-range drive. Rashford\u2019s fine, but Faes is down. He was caught on the shin by Sabitzer\u2019s studs, a pretty poor challenge for which Sabitzer should at least have been booked. It wasn\u2019t a particularly forceful tackle, which is why VAR didn\u2019t get involved, but it still wasn\u2019t great.  Updated at 2.43pm GMT    2.41pm    41 min Garnacho has been very quiet, as he often is when he starts a game. Mind you, you could say the same of all the United attackers bar maybe Fernandes. Even Rashford has been peripheral apart from the goal.     2.40pm    40 min I think Alexandra Ashton has settled the ten Hag debate, or should I say Ten Hag. \u201cAccording to the Modern Language Association Style Manual: \u2018Particles in Dutch surnames\u2014such as van, van den, van der, de, and ter\u2014are lowercased in prose when the whole name is given. When using only the last name, capitalize the particle.\u2019 So, Ten Hag, Van Dijk, but Erik ten Hag, Virgil van Dijk.\u201d      2.39pm    39 min Barnes plays a neat one-two with Maddison in the area but then lobs his cross over the head of Iheanacho at the far post. Leicester are playing through United so easily.     2.37pm    37 min: Sound the comedy-miss klaxon! Diogo Dalot has missed from six yards. He started the move himself, surging infield and finding Fernandes on the right side of the area. Fernandes shaped a beautiful cross back towards Dalot, who went with his wrong foot, the right, and poked the ball wide of the far post.   Updated at 2.52pm GMT    2.36pm    36 min Leicester continue to probe, and Weghorst has to make an excellent sliding tackle on Iheanacho in the D. The goal hasn\u2019t really changed the pattern of the game; if anything, it has cemented it.     2.34pm    34 min \u201cThe problem is often caused by an auto-correct function that insists on capitalising initials,\u201d says Piers Spence, \u201cbut the \u2018V\u2019 in van Dijk is otherwise only capitalised by people who don\u2019t know any better.\u201d Ah, well. Now. This is from the Guardian style guide. But then, this is the Guardian.  Van Gogh, Vincent(1853-90) Dutch artist; note that as with most Dutch names it is Van Gogh when just the surname is used (a Van Gogh masterpiece) but van Gogh with the forename (a masterpiece by Vincent van Gogh)      2.33pm    32 min Fernandes\u2019s free-kick is only half cleared to Garnacho, who launches a snapshot into orbit from the edge of the area. He had time to take a touch there.     2.32pm    31 min Tete\u2019s crossfield pass finds Maddison on the left edge of the area. He flicks it back to the onrushing Dewsbury-Hall, who sweeps a shot wide of the far post. This isn\u2019t news, but James Maddison really is a class act. In my painfully humble opinion, he\u2019s good enough for any team in the world.   Updated at 2.54pm GMT    2.30pm    30 min \u201cCasemiro,\u201d says Jeff Sax, \u201cshould not have tried to strangle someone.\u201d It was just physical banter. (But seriously, I thought he was a bit unlucky to be sent off.)     2.28pm    27 min \u201cEcho all the plaudits for this superlative series,\u201d says, erm, Mammillaria Hahniana of Mr Inbetween. \u201cAmazed it didn\u2019t get picked up by a mainstream broadcaster in UK. I wonder which Prem manager\u2019s post-match interview technique is inspired Ray\u2019s \u2018I don\u2019t answer questions\u2019 to the coppers?\u201d I\u2019ll give you a clue: he\u2019s also bald.     2.27pm    26 min The scoreline is a travesty, not that United will care.     2.26pm    It was another clinical finish. Souttar tried to play offside at the wrong moment, which meant Rashford was comfortably onside as he ran onto Fernandes\u2019s pass from the right. Rashford slowed down to get his bearings, considered a pass across goal to Garnacho - and then rammed the ball into the far corner.  Updated at 2.29pm GMT    2.25pm   GOAL! Man Utd 1-0 Leicester (Yep 25)  Marcus Rashford\u2019s purple patch continues!    Updated at 2.52pm GMT    2.24pm    24 min Maddison is holding his groin, which is a big concern for Leicester. He\u2019s been terrific in the first quarter of the game.     2.23pm    22 min \u201cI gave ten Hag (the \u2018t\u2019 not capitalised, as it\u2019s his proper name, so that language\u2019s conventions are used and not ours) a pass for pretty much sticking to his starting XI through that three-game cup stretch in January,\u201d says Eric Peterson. \u201cThey went into that stretch winless in two games against Crystal Palace and Arsenal (ohh, what a game that was!).  \u201cPlus, Manchester United were still only a month removed from the impact of purging that toxin that was present-day Cristiano Ronaldo from the club. They were at a point in getting their squad to mesh together that most teams reach in September and October. And now here they are, on the heels of an extraordinary first leg against Barcelona and unbeaten since that Arsenal game. Hindsight tells me Casemiro and the rest of the first squad needed to play more than they needed to rest \u2013 one more tough decision that ten Hag has absolutely nailed.\u201d I completely (and politely) disagree. More importantly, is that right re: ten Hag? If so, why is Van Dijk capitalised when we only use his surname?      2.22pm    21 min See 14 min.     2.22pm    20 min: Another great save from de Gea! Leicester continue to create chance. Castagne gets to the byline and flips a cross towards the unmarked Iheanacho beyond the far post. His downward header zips off the turf and is clawed away to his right, Inspector Gadget-style, by de Gea. Brilliant save.     2.19pm    19 min \u201cI don\u2019t think you can compare the situation of United with that of Newcastle,\u201d says Mark Rossell. \u201cUnited have, as i understand it, a much more powerful and vociferous Supporters \u2018Union\u2019 and the FA might find it harder to let that deal go through as they did with Newcastle. Newcastle fans were just so fed up and desirous of better days, that most were acquiescent, cynical, &amp; indifferent (to sportswashing), but United fans want their club back, and will put up a bigger fight. will be interesting to see how it all pans out.\u201d I\u2019d love to share your optimism. Anyway, let\u2019s talk about something else; it\u2019s too depressing.     2.18pm    18 min Tete cuts inside Lindelof on the right of the area and wallops a cross shot that just evades Barnes at the far post. Leicester are the better team here.     2.16pm    16 min \u201cHere\u2019s hoping Garnacho has a better game as starter than he did against Leeds,\u201d says Adam Roberts. \u201cI\u2019d like to see Pellistri given more game time - he looks very promising.\u201d I agree, he\u2019s looked really sparky whenever I\u2019ve seen him for United or Uruguay. At this stage Garnacho is much better as a substitute, isn\u2019t he.      2.15pm    15 min Tete runs at Lindelof and clips a dangerous cross that is kicked behind by Fred, facing his own goal. Good defending.     2.15pm    14 min This game is really open, and yes this is the bit where I mention the absence of Casemiro.     2.14pm    13 min \u201cMr. Inbetween is indeed superb, the best series on TV during its three series run,\u201d says Michael Guest. \u201cI read a very nice story that Dame Helen Mirren and her husband watched it, and enjoyed it so much that they sent it to their agent, who then agreed to represent creator/writer/star Scott Ryan. \u201cRyan has, as far as I know, only ever played Ray \u2018The Magician\u2019 Shoesmith in Mr. Inbetween and the preceding film The Magician and has no other roles on his CV.\u201d Yep, that\u2019s right. And he\u2019s fantastic! I think that\u2019s why there was such a gap, 15-odd years, between The Magician and Mr Inbetween, because every TV company wanted somebody else to play Ray.      2.11pm    10 min: Chance for Leicester! Maddison pokes a nice pass through to Iheanacho, who moves into the area but then mishits a shot that hits the sliding Lindelof and dribbles just wide of the near post. Iheanacho\u2019s first touch was poor, which made the angle much tighter, and the second wasn\u2019t a classic either.  Updated at 2.11pm GMT    2.10pm    10 min The resulting corner is headed over by Souttar, a half chance, and then Rashford has a volley blocked at the other end. This is a cracking start to the game.     2.10pm    8 min: Great save by de Gea! Leicester have started to play. Fred gives the ball to Barnes on the halfway line, and he runs 30 yards before finding Iheanacho on the edge of the D. Iheanacho returns the ball to Barnes, who zooms through a small gap and into the area. He takes the shot very early, and de Gea shows brilliant reflexes to thrust out his right hand and push the ball behind for a corner.  Updated at 2.11pm GMT    2.07pm    7 min Castagne gets away down the right and slides a low cross that is cleared by the off balance Sabitzer. That was an important touch because Leicester had a number of players forward.     2.06pm    6 min \u201cI\u2019m going to enjoy this one,\u201d says Shane Oleary. \u201cTwo slickly aggressive teams and I don\u2019t care who wins, although a United win would annoy Pep... So, come on United!\u201d The Premier League got to you as well.     2.05pm    5 min Sabitzer wins possession high up the field, with the ball ricocheting to Rashford on the right side of the area. He rattles an early shot that hits Souttar (I think) and goes behind for a corner. Nothing comes of it.     2.04pm    4 min United have made a bright and breezy start, with most of the game taking pace in the Leicester half at the moment.     2.02pm    2 min Fernandes wins an early corner. Shaw takes, Souttar heads away.     2.01pm    1 min United have started, as expected, with Wout Weghorst as the No10, Marcus Rashford up front and Bruno Fernandes roaming from the right.     2.00pm    1 min Peep peep!     1.55pm    The players are in the tunnel, the Stone Roses are on the tannoy. It\u2019s time for business.     1.54pm    \u201cEngland has shown that only money counts,\u201d says Jeff Sax, \u201cand they will find a way to let Qatar buy Man Utd ... just like they let Saudi Arabia buy Newcastle. Enjoy the game.\u201d Well, I was hoping to until that email.  Updated at 2.02pm GMT    1.54pm    \u201cNice to see Ten Hag not moaning about United having less recovery time ahead of this fixture than their opponents,\u201d says Rick Harris. \u201c That said it is clearly an advantage for Leicester that United had to play just 65 hours ago in Spain against the La Liga leaders. If United do take the three points then they are definitely in the title race.\u201d You have to think the schedule will catch up with United eventually. My one criticism of ten Hag this season (should I cap up the T, as with Van Dijk, when I don\u2019t use his first name?) is that he didn\u2019t rotate enough in the easier cup games. Casemiro v Reading FHS.     1.52pm    \u201cMr Inbetween...what a show!\u201d says Ronan O\u2019Brien. \u201cI thought I was the only one that appreciated it.\u201d It might be my favourite show since the Sopranos. And as somebody who aspires to write something decent one day, the story behind it is really inspiring \u2013 no artistic compromise at all, married with a complete lack of pretension.       1.44pm    United have two huge games coming up: Barcelona in the Europa League on Thursday, then Newcastle in the Carabao Cup final a week today. Here are a few appetite whetters from the archive.        1.44pm    \u201cFunny how Maddison is a critical darling, as opposed to another player (Mr Martial) who also pops up for a time, does well, but then is injured for twice as long,\u201d says Duncan Edwards. \u201cOn that note, if Martial is fit to face Barca next week will, indeed should, Ten Hag keep him instead for the Carabao final?\u201d That\u2019s a bit harsh on Maddison \u2013 he played 53 games like season! I think he\u2019s pretty wonderful. As for Martial, goodness knows: it sounds like he hasn\u2019t been 100 per cent fit all season, so I suspect he\u2019ll be on the bench at best. I would start Rashford up front against Barcelona; not sure about Newcastle as they will defend deep, but then Wembley is a biggish pitch.     1.39pm    A word from the managers       1.33pm    This is a terrific interview with Leicester\u2019s new centre-back Harry Souttar, who has been through extreme emotions in the past six months: he starred at the World Cup, and got a move to the Premier League, but those career highs` were overshadowed by the death of his brother Aaron from motor neurone disease.  On the vague subject of Australia and motor neurone disease, I cannot recommend the TV show Mr Inbetween highly enough. The performance of Nicholas Cassim, who plays somebody with MND, is among the best acting I\u2019ve ever seen.  Updated at 1.34pm GMT    1.29pm    Imagine going downhill from the Glazers      1.07pm   Team news  Erik ten Hag makes five changes from the draw in Barcelona on Thursday. Diogo Dalot, Victor Lindelof, Lisandro Martinez, Marcel Sabitzer and Alejandro Garnacho replace Aaron Wan-Bissaka, Raphael Varane, Tyrell Malacia, Casemiro and Jadon Sancho.  Leicester, as you\u2019d expect of a team in such sparkling form, are unchanged. Manchester United (possible 4-2-3-1) de Gea; Dalot, Lindelof, Martinez, Shaw; Sabitzer, Fred; Fernandes, Weghorst, Garnacho; Rashford.Substitutes: Heaton, Malacia, Varane, Wan-Bissaka, Mainoo, McTominay, Pellistri, Elanga, Sancho. Leicester City (4-2-3-1) Ward; Castagne, Souttar, Faes, Kristiansen; Mendy, Dewsbury-Hall; Tete, Maddison, Barnes; Iheanacho.Substitutes: Iverson, Ricardo, Amartey, Ndidi, Soumare, Tielemans, Praet, Daka, Vardy. Referee Craig Pawson.      12.45pm   Preamble  Right, are Manchester United in this title race or what? They\u2019re eight points behind the leaders Arsenal, but if they beat Leicester today they\u2019ll be only three behind Manchester City \u2013 the team who most people regard as favourites to win the league. Most logic, and all instinct, suggests it\u2019s too much, too soon, especially with a thinning squad and an imminent fixture pile-up. Even so, it\u2019s an extraordinary achievement from Erik ten Hag to have United sitting comfortably in third, especially after such a diabolical start to the season. And if they do somehow become champions, he\u2019ll be immortal. All United can do is keep winning and see where it takes them. That won\u2019t be easy this afternoon against a Leicester side who \u2013 surprise, surprise \u2013 have been rejuvenated by the return of James Maddison. They\u2019ve scored eight goals in their last two league games, and their front four of Maddison, Harvey Barnes, Tete and Kelechi Iheanacho will give United\u2019s defence a good test today. Erik wouldn\u2019t have it any other way. Kick off 2pm   Updated at 12.54pm GMT "

                    "body": "Elon Musk has warned that a US recession is \u201cmore likely than not\u201d to come soon as the Tesla chief executive confirmed plans to cut 10% of salaried staff at the electric carmaker over the next three months. The world\u2019s richest man said a recession in the US was inevitable but would most probably come in the short term. \u201cA recession is inevitable at some point. As to whether there is a recession in the near term, that is more likely than not,\u201d Musk said in an interview via videolink at the Qatar Economic Forum in Doha on Tuesday.  Musk said Tesla was planning to reduce salaried staff numbers by 10%, confirming plans revealed in an internal email this month by Reuters. \u201cTesla is reducing its salaried workforce by roughly 10% over the next probably three months or so,\u201d Musk said at the event hosted by Bloomberg. \u201cWe expect to grow our hourly workforce. But we grew very fast on the salaried side, and we grew a little too fast in some areas.\u201d Tesla employs just under 100,000 people but Musk said the cuts would amount to a reduction of about 3.5% because salaried workers represent around one-third of the workforce, while Tesla is increasing the amount of staff it employs on an hourly basis, who account for about two-thirds of the workforce. Musk\u2019s outlook echoes comments from other executives, including JPMorgan boss Jamie Dimon, who warned this month that a \u201churricane is right out there down the road coming our way\u201d. The US president, Joe Biden, reiterated on Monday that he felt a US recession was not inevitable, even as the world\u2019s largest economy struggles to tackle high petrol prices and inflation, which is at its highest in 40 years. Former US treasury secretary Lawrence Summers told NBC News on Sunday that he too expected a recession. Musk also spoke about his $44bn (\u00a336bn) bid to buy Twitter, which received a formal endorsement from the social media firm\u2019s board on Tuesday.  Musk said there were unresolved issues, including the debt portion of the deal and the number of spam users. Lawyers representing the Tesla boss have warned he could walk away from the deal due to a dispute over how Twitter calculates the number of fake or spam accounts on its platform. \u201cWe\u2019re still awaiting resolution on that matter, and that is a very significant matter,\u201d he said, reiterating doubts over Twitter\u2019s claims that false or spam accounts represented fewer than 5% of its 229m daily active users. Musk also expressed doubt about the debt funding for the deal, which is being raised from a consortium of banks that have pledged $13bn. \u201cAnd then of course, there\u2019s the question of, will the, the debt portion of the round come together? And then will the shareholders vote in favour?\u201d Musk said he would like to get 80% of North America and half the world on Twitter. \u201cMy aspiration for Twitter is to be as inclusive as possible,\u201d he said."

                    "body": "In February 2020, as Elena Rybakina\u2019s rise up the rankings became impossible to ignore, she and her coach, Stefano Vukov, made a mischievous bet during the Qatar Open. If she won Wimbledon, he said, he would get a tattoo of her name. She recorded his pledge, but then forgot about it. Covid struck soon after, and instead she spent the next two years trying to recover her form. Today, Vukov carries Rybakina\u2019s name and the date of this year\u2019s Wimbledon final in indelible ink on his right arm, a permanent reminder of this golden summer. A month ago, Rybakina capped off her startling rise to the big stage in July by winning her first grand slam title at Wimbledon.  \u201cI already forgot [about the bet] \u2013 we were laughing around,\u201d Rybakina says. \u201cBefore the final, he told me that he would do it. So, he did it. For me, it\u2019s still crazy, I can\u2019t believe it. But it is what it is. We had a bet.\u201d Rybakina\u2019s run to the Wimbledon title was not at all shocking, but it was still remarkable. She scuppered two grand slam title winners in Bianca Andreescu and Simona Halep, then was ice cold in her first grand slam final as she overpowered Ons Jabeur, the second seed. Her destructive serve, which regularly hits 120mph, was always present in the big moments. The days that followed were a blur. Rybakina was greeted by masses when arriving home, then received an Order of Friendship medal from the prime minister of Kazakhstan, Alikhan Smailov. She pledged to donate the bonus she received from the Kazakh Federation to dog rescue and junior tennis in the country. For a calm, introverted person, the spotlight was intense.  \u201cIt was really nice to see, especially kids, how happy they were to see me. They were hugging, taking pictures. But it was actually very tough for me, just because there were many activities. I didn\u2019t have much rest, to be honest.\u201d Rybakina\u2019s time at Wimbledon had provided enough outside noise. With the All England Club remaining steadfast on its ban on Russian players because of the invasion of Ukraine, the deeper she went into the tournament the more her identity as a Moscow\u2011born player who chose to represent Kazakhstan to advance her career was interrogated. In Kazakhstan, Rybakina responded to a question by showing her passport to the audience. Even beyond her identity, Rybakina\u2019s path is noteworthy. While her peers were preparing for the professional tour as children, she was playing for fun in group sessions after high school. \u201cI was always wanting to go after school because my friends are there, we are having fun on court. I never thought that, in the end, I\u2019m gonna stay professional,\u201d she says. Rybakina\u2019s trajectory changed after a fruitful junior career yielded offers to play at US colleges. As she stood at that crossroads, she convinced her concerned father to let her try the professional game. After financial problems and a nationality switch, the structure provided by her first private coach, Vukov, in 2018 led to her rise up the rankings.  Watching the pair in practice is always noteworthy. Rybakina is as calm and understated as any athlete, while Vukov is frantic and intense, delivering criticism and feedback constantly. The week before Wimbledon produced a particularly memorable sight on the practice courts at Eastbourne when she became exasperated by his nagging while returning 135mph service bombs of Alexander Bublik. The current world No 47 noticed the tension and closed off the session by suggesting Vukov step up to face the fastballs. There was more than a smirk on Rybakina\u2019s face as the aces flew past her coach. \u201cI\u2019m a very calm person and he is very active,\u201d Rybakina says. \u201cHe has so much energy and I think it works well for us because we are completely different. He\u2019s always pushing me to be better and this works. I\u2019ve had great results with him. We\u2019ll see how long and how many more achievements we can make together.\u201d Despite fulfilling a lifetime goal, tennis provides no opportunity for rest and introspection. Rybakina returned to competition a few weeks after Wimbledon, losing 6-0 in the third set of her opening\u2011round match in San Jose against Daria Kasatkina. She fared considerably better at the Western &amp; Southern Open in Cincinnati, reaching the quarter-finals.  As a result of the WTA\u2019s removal of ranking points from Wimbledon in response to the ban on Russian and Belarusian players, Rybakina has fallen two spots to No 25 in the world despite her triumph. She must now consolidate her success while being at risk of drawing top players early at the US Open, which starts on Monday, and beyond. \u201cIt\u2019s never enough, I think. The goal is to win many more grand slams. For this year, my goal was to be top 10,\u201d she says and then laughs. \u201cStill it\u2019s the same goal because I didn\u2019t move in the ranking. It\u2019s just the last grand slam of this year, to try and get as far as I can.\u201d"

                    "body": "Chinese media have largely ignored widespread protests across the country, with prominent state newspaper front pages instead choosing to focus on Taiwan\u2019s local elections, a Chinese-built solar plant in Qatar and the rising number of Chinese women choosing to get tanned in beauty salons. Protests flared across Chinese cities over the weekend, with calls for political freedoms and an end to Covid lockdowns. Some demonstrators have even demanded the resignation of China\u2019s president, Xi Jinping, in a wave of civil disobedience that has been unprecedented in mainland China over the past decade. However, none of that was evident on the front pages of some of the country\u2019s most prominent newspapers, or on broadcast channels on Monday. After a night of unrest, CCTV spent most of the morning covering the announcement of the planned launch of the Shenzhou-15 spacecraft to China\u2019s space station on Tuesday. The English language Global Times\u2019 main headline focused on the weekend\u2019s local elections in Taiwan, while Shanghai media reported on the latest industrial revenue figures.  The country\u2019s efforts to contain Covid were, however, heavily featured across the news, analysis and editorial pages of the country\u2019s papers. Most of Hong Kong\u2019s mainstream media, normally fast to respond to news on mainland China, meanwhile delayed the reporting of the ubiquitous protests across China by one day and led the stories from the official angle. Most led with the Covid case numbers, or official insistence of the Covid control and played down on the details and colour of the protests themselves. Promises to fine-tune the zero-Covid strategy to limit the disruption caused by lockdowns featured in a number of mainland media outlets on Monday, in what some analysts interpreted as a subtle nod to the protests. Multiple outlets, including Communist party mouthpiece the People\u2019s Daily, ran editorials urging \u201cunswerving adherence\u201d to the zero-Covid policies, which they said was the only correct path. A front page story on the Global Times warned of \u201can extremely challenging winter\u201d as the country \u201cfine tunes\u201d its Covid measures.  Acknowledging some problems in China\u2019s response, the report urged readers to think beyond the two \u201cpolarized yet erroneous tendencies\u201d to infection control: \u201ceither a complete lockdown or a \u2018lying flat\u2019, meaning no pandemic precautions at all.\u201d The outlook, though, remains gloomy, as the paper reports that, \u201ccompared with the past two years, China is facing a much tougher battle against the virus\u201d. The authors of the article quote an unnamed expert who warns that authorities may have to take \u201cexcessive measures\u201d.  The supposed need for these measures is demonstrated in a comment piece published by news agency Xinhua. \u201cChina has pulled out all the stops to put the people and their lives above everything else, managing to keep the death rates and the number of serious cases low,\u201d the opinion article reads. \u201cWithout those resolute measures, the consequence could be disastrous for a country with 1.4 billion people, including 267 million aged 60 or above and more than 250 million children.\u201d  In what could be read as a rare criticism of China\u2019s health system, the article quotes a pharmaceuticals analyst as saying that a full reopening of China may \u201cthreaten a health system that currently has far fewer ICU beds than those of other developed countries\u201d. The catalyst for this weekend\u2019s public anger was a deadly fire in a building in the western city of Urumqi last week, which was reported to be under Covid restrictions.  State newspaper China Daily reported a statement from a government official that Covid restrictions weren\u2019t, in fact, related to the fire deaths.  While acknowledging public anger over the fire, the report quoted an unnamed local official as claiming without evidence that videos circulating online showing sealed up doors were filmed elsewhere and \u201cput together with footage of the accident with ill intention\u201d. Other state media also covered the decision to lift some Covid restrictions in Urumqi on Monday, without mentioning public anger over the fire. Additional reporting by Chi Hui Lin and Verna Yu "

                    "body": "  6.53am   England have hope, just.  That sound? A huge sigh of relief being breathed in unison by England\u2019s players, coaches and supporters. Aaaaah. They got over the line today thanks to a much tighter performance in all three disciplines. Heather Knight played a captain\u2019s knock to see them home after a shaky start, she was there at the end to make sure the points went into the bag.  They still have plenty to do but it isn\u2019t inconceivable England can go on a bit of a run to secure a slot in the semi-final. They\u2019ll have to overcome New Zealand, Bangladesh and Pakistan to stay alive in the tournament. The fact they made quick work of that pesky run chase today will stand them in good stead with the number crunchers if it comes down to that at some point too.  India were below par today, England bowled well but you don\u2019t win many games when skittled for 134. They never got going with the bat and Ecclestone and Dean were simply too good.  That\u2019s me handing in my OBO badge and gun for the day, thanks on behalf of Tanya and myself for joining us for England\u2019s first win for five long months. We\u2019ll be back to bring you the next game in a couple of days time. We\u2019ll see if England\u2019s World Cup wagon can keep on rollin\u2019. Until then, goodbye!      6.34am    No wonder Heather Knight was feeling relieved:      6.33am         6.32am    The captains are next up:  Mithali Raj: \u201cWe definitely didn\u2019t have partnership at the top of order... despite getting what we wanted after losing the toss. We\u2019ll look to address that in the next match. She goes on to congratulate Jhulan Ghoswami for taking 250 ODI wickets.  Heather Knight: \u201cIt\u2019s a bit of relief, we needed that! Our bowlers were outstanding, it wasn\u2019t an easy pitch to bat on but Ecclestone and Dean made it difficult. The pitch was slow and tricky and I really wanted to finish it off today. Congratulations to Goswami for her milestone. The cricket gods seemed to be on our side. Nat(Sciver) was outstanding, she took the pressure off me on a tricky wicket.\u201d     6.22am    Charlie Dean is Player of the Match  The greenhorn spinner took 4 for 23 and in a touching moment thanks her parents: \u201cI can\u2019t imagine you\u2019d be up, but this is for you\u201d     6.18am         6.17am         6.15am   England win by 4 wickets  There it is, Ecclestone crunches a pull shot away into the vacant square leg boundary. England are up and running!      6.13am    30th over: England 131-6 (Knight 53 Ecclestone 1) England one hit away, four runs needed to chalk up their first win of the tournament.      6.10am    Injury scare for India - Harmanpreet Kaur gets her knee caught in the turf and it looks as though she jars it slightly. Thankfully she stands up and walks off the field with the physio. Hopefully it is more precautionary and nothing more serious.      6.06am    29th over: England 129-6 (Knight 52 Ecclestone) Just six more needed for England. Sophie Ecclestone joins Knight in the middle.      6.03am   WICKET! Brunt c Ghosh b Meghna Singh 0  Another! England spluttering over the line here. Brunt hacks a short ball straight up in the air and is comfortably caught by the keeper Ghosh. A layer of gloss just coming off this England run chase.      6.01am   WICKET! Dunkley ct Ghosh b Meghna Singh 17  Has to go now though! Dunkley steers one straight into the keeper\u2019s gloves.      5.59am    28th over: England 128-4 (Knight 51 Dunkley 17) Lovely little cameo from Dunkley this, she runs down and dismissively swats Rana away past mid off! England a couple of hits away now.      5.57am    27th over: England 122-4 (Knight 50 Dunkley 12) Huge, decisive over for England! Surely they\u2019ve done this now. 13 runs coming from it. First up Heather Knight goes to fifty! Another classy off drive through the covers. Well batter skipper! Dunkley then upper cuts a bouncer for four, both feet in the air as she goes aerial over point. A thin edge off a forward prod also brings a third boundary from the over! Just 13 needed now.     5.53am    26th over: England 109-4 (Knight 45 Dunkley 4) Dunkley won\u2019t be dictated too though, she runs down and clatters Gayakwad back over mid on for four! Nasser is saying how impressed he was with Amy Jones, putting the team before herself as she tried to get the job done quickly, perhaps with an eye on net run rate which could come in to play later in the competition.      5.49am    25th over: England 104-4 (Knight 44 Dunkley 0) Sophia Dunkley is the new batter and she pats back a maiden. India on the squeeze, trying to make it as uncomfortable as possible for England to get over the line.      5.47am   WICKET! Jones c Kaur b Gayakwad 10  Amy Jones plays the shot of the day to dispatch Gayakwad for SIX back over her head. But then she falls trying to do the same again! Doesn\u2019t quite get it the second time around and the ball plinks up in the air where Kaur takes a fine catch pedalling backwards.  India need six wickets. England need 31 runs. 25th over: England 104-4 (Knight 44 Dunkley 0)      5.41am    24th over: England 95-3 (Knight 41 Jones 4) Knight sweeps powerfully for four more! Conventional sweep this time but same result. Seven runs in total off Sharma\u2019s over. England close in on a hundred and there\u2019s a bit of chirrup starting outside my window. Staccato squawks. More dawn-beatbox than chorus.      5.35am    23rd over: England 88-3 (Knight 35 Jones 3) Maiden from Goswami, keeping England, and Amy Jones honest.      5.34am         5.33am    22nd over: England 88-3 (Knight 35 Jones 3) Lovely shot! Knight gets her reverse sweep on and nails it. The ball pinging off the bat, wide of the sprawling fielder and away for four. Classy from the captain. A couple of nudged singles take England that bit closer too. 47 more runs needed.     5.29am    21st over: England 82-3 (Knight 30 Jones 2) Just a couple off Goswami\u2019s over. Deepti Sharma is coming into the attack.     5.28am    Here\u2019s a shot of that Sciver moment of fortune from earlier on. #HeavyBails      5.26am    20th over: England 80-3 (Knight 29 Jones 1) Six runs off Gayakwad\u2019s latest over. Knight again showing she is in good touch, steering a full ball down to the point boundary. Jones gets off the mark with a push too. Goswami is coming back into the attack. India sensing that they need to remove England\u2019s captain to really ramp up the pressure here. 20 overs done.     5.22am    19th over: England 74-3 (Knight 24 Jones 0) Knight leans on a full ball and gets it away for a well timed boundary.   (Sorry)     5.19am    18th over: England 69-3 (Knight 19 Jones 0) A maiden from Gayakwad. Is there another twist here? It has nothing, repeat nothing to do with my coffee intake, OK?!     5.17am   Nat Sciver c Goswami b Vastrakar 45  Whoops! Sciver goes! She mistimes one of those short arm jabs and it loops off a leading edge to mid on. She had just smeared another boundary too and was looking to get this done in quick time. Amy Jones is the new batter. England have seven wickets left and need 66 runs to stay alive. 17th over: England 69-3 (Knight 19 Jones 0)  Updated at 5.18am GMT    5.12am    16th over: England 60-2 (Knight 14 Sciver 41) Gayakwad returns and starts tightly, just a single from it as the sun begins to set in in Tauranga. There\u2019s an of hour or so before dawn might start to creak here in south London.  Just FYI... I decided against any more coffee at the drinks break, so confident am I that England are going to wrap this up in good time and I\u2019ll be able to get a bit of shut eye before the baby awakes. Obviously me typing this will have no effect on the result. Obviously.      5.06am    15th over: England 59-2 (Knight 13 Sciver 41) Fifty partnership up for this pair. Sciver the aggressor as again she plays a short arm jab off Rana that whistles away to the fence. She then does well to get some blade on a very wide ball outside off stump, but gets enough and the ball trickles into the sponge for another welcome boundary! 11 runs in total taken from the over. 15 gone and time for a drink.      5.00am    14th over: England 48-2 (Knight 12 Sciver 32) Sciver bunts a full bunger from Vastrakar straight to the fielder and is annoyed with herself for missing out. Next ball she makes sure, rocking back and powefully scything the ball through mid-wicket to leave the boundary rider with no chance. Four runs.      4.57am    13th over: England 43-2 (Knight 10 Sciver 28) Two more off Sneh Rana\u2019s spinners. Things have calmed down out there but the game is still on a knife edge. England\u2019s skipper and vice skipper are showing all their experience, calmly accumulating, trying to break the back of this tricky little chase.      4.54am    12th over: England 41-2 (Knight 9 Sciver 27) England manage just a couple off Vastrakar. Sneh Rana is coming on for a twirl at the other end.      4.51am    11th over: England 39-2 (Knight 9 Sciver 26) A deft late cut from Sciver brings her two. She has great touch as well as power. A deft sweep gets her two more. These two sides sparring at the moment, who is going to land a decisive blow? Remember if England lose this game it is curtains for their World Cup campaign.      4.47am    10th over: England 34-2 (Knight 9 Sciver 21) End of the first ten/powerplay. India were 37-3 at this stage. Vastrakar into the attack and starts tightly, just a single taken. A pulsating first ten overs.      4.44am    Errr...  Pressure does strange things...     4.42am    9th over: England 33-2 (Knight 9 Sciver 20) Spin from Gayakwad and Sciver is sweeping effectively, picking up two fours from the over by paddling the ball into the vacant deep square leg. Excellent batting. Nine runs off the over.      4.39am    8th over: England 24-2 (Knight 9 Sciver 11) England deal in singles as India show off some excellent fielding skills. Four from the over. Chipping away...     4.38am         4.36am    7th over: England 21-2 (Knight 8 Sciver 9) Knight pulls Goswami away for four! Sciver also drops and runs for a single.  <sub>Whisper it... but these two batters look in good knick. </sub>     4.32am    6th over: England 16-2 (Knight 4 Sciver 8) A maiden from Singh. The TV replays are showing Sciver\u2019s stroke of luck with the belligerent bails but also her freak dismissal from the other day against South Africa where she perished through a combo of hip and back of the bat. Funny how these things even themselves out.      4.27am    5th over: England 16-2 (Knight 4 Sciver 8) Nat Sciver is underway with a cover drive for four too! The outfield looks to have got a tad quicker, she didn\u2019t get all of it but it scorched away over the turf. Woweee! Sciver then squeezes a full ball from Goswami onto her back pad and the ball rolls into the stumps with a thunk! BUT THE BAILS DON\u2019T FALL OFF! What a stroke of luck. Sciver has a wry smile, then cashes in by bunting the final ball of the over for four! OK, I\u2019m awake now!      4.22am    4th over: England 8-2 (Knight 4 Sciver 0) Knight is watchful, understandably, blocking resolutely. But then she unfurls a lovely cover drive to bring up England\u2019s first boundary. A welcome breather.      4.19am   Wicket! Beaumont lbw b Goswami 1  3rd over: England 4-2 (Knight 0 Sciver 0) Heather Knight is the new batter. Goswami starts with another wide down the leg side to Beaumont but is then on the money, joining five dots in a row. Appeal for lbw! And Beaumont has to go! The ball clipping the pad before bat and the dreaded three reds appear to show the ball would have hit the stumps. England lose another!      4.11am   Wicket! Wyatt ct Rana b Meghna Singh 1  Wyatt fences at a lifter and is pouched by a leaping Rana at slip! England lose their first and India are in raptures. Rana starts with a wicket maiden. You didn\u2019t think it would be straightforward did you?! 2nd over: England 3-1 (Beaumont 1 Knight 0)  Updated at 4.13am GMT    4.07am    1st over: England 3-0 (Beaumont 1 Wyatt 1) England get their chase underway through a wide ball first up from Goswami. Beaumont and Wyatt then both scamper singles.  Thanks very much Tanya, Jim here picking up the reins for this chase, will it be a nerve-jangler or will England try and do it at a canter? Get in touch if you are out there and tuning in!     4.01am    The two teams are out on the field as I handover to James Wallace who is primed with caffeine to take England over the line. Thanks for tuning in, bye!     3.57am    I must tell you the teams, following that slight technical hitch early this morning: England: Danni Wyatt, Tammy Beaumont, Heather Knight, Nat Sciver, Amy Jones (wk), Charlie Dean, Sophia Dunkley, Katherine Brunt, Sophie Ecclestone, Kate Cross, Anya Shrubsole. India: Smriti Mandhana, Yastika Bhatia, Mithali Raj, Deepti Sharma, Harmanpreet Kaur, Richa Ghosh(wk), Sneh Rana, Pooja Vastrakar, Jhulan Goswami, Meghna Singh, Rajeshwari Gayakwad.  Updated at 4.02am GMT    3.42am    \u201cHi Tanya.\u201d Hello Phil Cavanagh! \u201cTHIS is the England everyone has been expecting (I\u2019m just thankful that Australia has already played them!). If they keep this up, they can really \u2018put the cat among the pigeons\u2019 for the rest of the tournament.\u201d Well exactly! I\u2019d almost written them off, thought they were too downhearted to find a performance like this.     3.39am   England need 135 to win!  A transformation by England! What did they do with that butter-fingered, head-dropping, length-miscalculating crew? Great catching, sprightly fielding, even better bowling and galactic drift by 21 year old Charlie Dean.  India seemed to get stuck after those two early wickets and when Mandhana fell under the pressure of dot balls, the end was nigh.  A short break now while the players dine.      3.33am   WICKET!  Meghna b Dean 3 India all out 134!  Meghna sweeps, desperately, misses, inelegantly, and is bowled! That\u2019s 4-23 for Charlie Dean, career best figures and the second best bowling of the tournament behind Marizanne Kapp\u2019s five-fer.  Updated at 4.03am GMT    3.29am    36th over :India 133-9 ( Gayakwad 0, Meghna 3) Ecclestone is back for her ninth. A super take from Jones behind the stumps to prevent a wide drifting down leg for four.  I\u2019ve just realised that the link on my email isn\u2019t working - do get in touch on tanya.aldred.freelance@theguardian.com if you have things to say.      3.26am    35th over :India 130-9 ( Gayakwad 0, Meghna 1) Nasser chastises Knight for not giving herself a slip, as she rattles through her over. On comms they point out that England need to finish this off asap - all grist to the mill of the net-run rate.   Updated at 4.21am GMT    3.25am    34th over :India 129-9 ( Gayakwad 0, Meghna 0) Cross picks up her first wicket as India crumble into the Mount Maunganui dust.      3.23am   WICKET!  Goswami c Wyatt b Cross 20  (India 129-9)   Nicely taken at neck height by Wyatt at backward point as Goswami has another swing for runs. Just the ink to dry now.     3.20am   WICKET!

A confidence injecting take.     1.28am    5th over: India 25-1 (Smriti 14, Mithali 1) Huge apologies for the tardy OBO start to this match , I somehow managed to sleep through my alarm.

A hundredth ODI wicket for Shrubsole as Yastika Bhatia edges behind.    Updated at 4.11am GMT    12.17am    India, who thrashed West Indies and Pakistan but lost to New Zealand, currently lie in third. Centuries from Smriti Mandhana (123 off 119) and Harmanpreet Kaur (109 off 107) against West Indies will put the wind up England, as will India\u2019s wily spinners: Rajeshwari Gayakwad and Sneh Rana . Meanwhile England\u2019s Amy Jones was in bullish mood: \u201c\u201cOur backs are up against the wall and we have all the motivation we need,\u201d Jones told BBC Sport. \u201cWe all know we can perform at this level. It\u2019s more about mindset and still believing. \u201cWe have an opportunity to do something incredible.\u201d Time for me to have a very quick forty winks, back in twenty minutes.     12.00am    Raf\u2019s reading of England\u2019s possible path to redemption:      12.00am   Preamble  Good morning from a cold and lonely Manchester living room. The action is far away, in gorgeous Mount Maunganui, where England\u2019s task is a tricky one. On their arses after three games without a win (v Australia, West Indies and, more recently, South Africa - as well as a disastrous Ashes campaign) they need to win this game - and the rest of the qualifiers. Then, if the results go their way, they\u2019re in with a chance of making the semi-finals. High risk stakes, especially with their fielding having gone to pot and a couple of the seamers not quite in top form There is some good news for England.  But Sophie Ecclestone can\u2019t do it on her own.  "

                    "body": "So will the Easter getaway herald the resurrection of British Airways and its owner International Airlines Group (IAG), or will the computer say no? The first big holiday break of the year and the start of the summer season should, according to IAG forecasts, bring a bumper crop of passengers after the grim first two years of the pandemic. The flag carrier expects to fly at full capacity on its most lucrative transatlantic services this summer, and last week returned to some outposts it had deserted at the height of the pandemic: Sydney in Australia, and London\u2019s Gatwick and City airports. But if the fear of Covid \u2013 if not the actual rate of infection \u2013 is receding, it has become clear that BA has yet to rid its systems of bugs. Customer service has been a recurrent complaint \u2013 shedding thousands of staff can\u2019t have helped \u2013 and was again put to the test in recent weeks. A series of IT failures led to the airline suffering ripples of apparently self-inflicted cancellations. BA has history with IT problems. Even if Covid has overshadowed any previous nightmares, the reappearance of this particular problem will have agitated investors as well as infuriating passengers. A pandemic is a decent excuse, but BA and IAG have had years to sort out these dodgy tech issues.  The biggest failure, in days when such disruptions were front-page news, came five years ago, with thousands of passengers stranded at Heathrow and around the world. The response to the crisis of the then relatively new BA boss \u00c1lex Cruz, criticised \u2013 fairly or not \u2013 as sluggish, appeared to spell the beginning of the end for the Spaniard. The current leadership has seen bigger problems, but solving this one could prove a headache for IAG boss Luis Gallego, who once worked under Cruz in Spain. His predecessor, Willie Walsh, angrily rejected claims that outsourcing the IT had been the problem; a single worker had accidentally tripped the power. With Walsh gone, the hapless engineer who pulled the plug in 2017 is presumably no longer quivering in the toilets. Eighteen months into his tenure, Gallego, obviously less combative and markedly less public, has yet to win over industry observers. But the change at the top underlines that Spain is now officially where the IAG action is, especially since Brexit. IAG insists this issue has long been put to bed, but prominent voices disagree. HSBC analyst Andrew Lobbenberg has not budged from his view that EU ownership and control rules could come back to bite the group, even though IAG wearily repeats that it has done everything necessary to satisfy regulators. Regulators may not be the issue, though. Ryanair chief executive Michael O\u2019Leary, wickedly stirring the pot last month, said that state-owned rivals Air France-KLM and Lufthansa were still \u201cgunning for the breakup\u201d of IAG, adding: \u201cAt European level, whatever the French and Germans want, they get. I think it is inevitable that BA will be forced out of IAG.\u201d An IAG without BA might seem like the Beatles without Lennon and McCartney, but the group\u2019s latest talks have been about bolstering its Madrid hub, with a deal that keeps options open for bid target Air Europa. Madrid is certainly cheaper, as Gallego has noted, than Heathrow, which has pitilessly raised charges. Both Heathrow and IAG have strong links with Qatar, which owns 20% of both, and Qatar Airways has been forging closer operational partnerships with BA. Meanwhile, the backdrop of war in Ukraine and rising jet fuel prices have clouded a summer revival: the Russian invasion sent IAG\u2019s share price to its lowest since 2020. The good news for IAG appears to be that customers are defying predictions that global uncertainty and the spiralling cost of living would dampen demand. This summer, at least, BA planes look set to be filled by Brits who really can\u2019t take it any longer and would rather spend their dwindling pounds on flying abroad than on insane energy bills. With luck, they and IAG will get there."

                    "body": "The latest bombshell in the scandal that has rocked the chess world to its foundation dropped on Tuesday when an investigation into the games of Hans Niemann found the American grandmaster has cheated far more frequently than previously disclosed.\nThe 72-page report, conducted by Chess.com and initially reviewed by the Wall Street Journal, found that Niemann \u201clikely received illegal assistance in more than 100 online games\u201d as recently as 2020, including in events where prize money was at stake.\n\nThe suspicions around Niemann, a 19-year-old who has made a meteoric ascent into the world\u2019s top 50 over the past four years, were initially amplified last month when the world champion Magnus Carlsen first suggested, then outright declared, the American was winning through illegitimate means.\nNiemann has mounted a vigorous denial of the allegations, though he did confess to violating the rules of fair play at least twice in the past by using the assistance of chess engines: first as a 12-year-old in an online tournament, and then as a 16-year-old playing unrated games while streaming.\nBut the Chess.com report, which relied on cheating-detection tools including a comparison of a player\u2019s moves to those recommended by powerful supercomputers, has offered compelling data-driven evidence that dramatically contradicts those statements. The investigation made no conclusions regarding Niemann\u2019s over-the-board games, but did flag contests from six of his stronger in-person events, stating they \u201cmerit further investigation based on the data\u201d.\nThe full investigation, which was made public on Tuesday evening, stated that Niemann privately confessed to the allegations, and that he was subsequently banned from for a period of time from Chess.com, the world\u2019s most popular chess platform.\n\nThe scandal erupted in September when Niemann beat Carlsen while playing with the black pieces at the $500,000 (\u00a3433,000) Sinquefield Cup in St Louis, ending the current world champion\u2019s 53-game unbeaten streak in classical over-the-board games. The shocking defeat and Carlsen\u2019s withdrawal ignited a maelstrom of comments and allegations that Niemann was cheating including from Hikaru Nakamura, the American grandmaster once ranked No 2 in the world.\nUnsatisfied by Niemann\u2019s explanation that he had somehow guessed what opening the Norwegian would play, Carlsen abruptly withdrew from the tournament, a virtually unprecedented decision for a sitting world champion that was interpreted as an act of protest. \u201cIf I speak I am in big trouble,\u201d Carlsen tweeted, making a strong allusion to impropriety on his opponent\u2019s side.\nThe controversy redoubled two weeks later when Carlsen and Niemann met again in the sixth round of the online Julius Baer Generation Cup and the world No 1 sensationally resigned after making just one move. Carlsen finally clarified his cryptic allusions with an official statement one week after, saying he was unwilling to \u201cplay against people that have cheated repeatedly in the past\u201d and that he believed Niemann had cheated \u201cmore than he has admitted\u201d.\n\n\u201cWhen Niemann was invited last minute to the 2022 Sinquefield Cup, I strongly considered withdrawing prior to the event,\u201d Carlsen said. \u201cI ultimately chose to play. I believe that Niemann has cheated more \u2013 and more recently \u2013 than he has publicly admitted.\n\u201cHis over-the-board progress has been unusual, and throughout our game in the Sinquefield Cup I had the impression that he wasn\u2019t tense or even fully concentrating on the game in critical positions, while outplaying me as black in a way I only think a handful of players can do. This game contributed to changing my perspective.\u201d\nThe Chess.com report backed up Carlsen\u2019s assessment of Niemann\u2019s uncommonly rapid climb up Fide\u2019s world ratings \u2013 a gain of 350 Elo points in four years and an astonishing surge from 2500 to 2600 in just three months \u2013 describing his rise as \u201cstatistically extraordinary\u201d while stopping short of concluding that he\u2019s cheated in any over-the-board games.\n\u201cOutside his online play, Hans is the fastest rising top player in Classical [over-the-board] chess in modern history,\u201d the report said. \u201cLooking purely at rating, Hans should be classified as a member of this group of top young players. While we don\u2019t doubt that Hans is a talented player, we note that his results are statistically extraordinary.\u201d\nThe report further explains the methodology behind Chess.com\u2019s cheat-detection tools, which include: \u201canalytics that compare moves to those recommended by chess engines; studies of a player\u2019s past performance and strength profile; monitoring behavior such as players opening up other browsers while playing; and input from grandmaster fair play analysts\u201d. Notably, it revealed that \u201cdozens\u201d of grandmasters have been caught cheating on Chess.com, including four of the world\u2019s current top 100, all of whom confessed.\n\nIt also addressed Niemann\u2019s curious postgame analysis of his stunning win over Carlsen in St Louis, which top players at the time characterised as \u201cat odds with the level of preparation that Hans claimed was at play in the game and the level of analysis needed to defeat the World Chess Champion\u201d.\nNiemann has steadfastly denied any wrongdoing at any point in recent years, stating one day after his win over Carlsen at the Sinquefield Cup that he\u2019d only cheated twice in the past.\n\u201cI cheated on random games on Chess.com,\u201d Niemann said. \u201cI was confronted. I confessed. And this is the single biggest mistake of my life. And I am completely ashamed. I am telling the world because I don\u2019t want misrepresentations and I don\u2019t want rumours. I have never cheated in an over-the-board game. And other than when I was 12 years old I have never cheated in a tournament with prize money.\u201d\nFide, the sport\u2019s world governing body, issued a statement last week saying it will convene its own three-person panel to look into the allegations.\n\u201cThe focus of the investigation would be twofold: checking the world champion\u2019s claims of alleged cheating by Niemann and Niemann\u2019s self-statement regarding online cheating,\u201d it read. \u201cThe panel will ensure a fair ruling, protecting the rights of both parties during the investigation.\u201d"

                    "body": "Good morning. The House select committee investigating the January 6 Capitol attack is expected to show at its fourth hearing today that Donald Trump and top advisers coordinated the scheme to send fake slates of electors as part of an effort to return him to the White House. The panel is also expected to examine Trump\u2019s campaign to put pressure on top officials in seven crucial battleground states to corruptly reverse his defeat to Joe Biden in the weeks and months after the 2020 election. At the afternoon hearing, the select committee is expected to focus heavily on the fake electors scheme, which has played a large part in its nearly year-long investigation into Trump\u2019s effort to overturn the results of the election at the state level. The panel will show how the fake electors scheme \u2013 which may have been illegal \u2013 was the underlying basis for Trump\u2019s unlawful strategy to have his vice-president, Mike Pence, refuse to certify Biden\u2019s win in certain states and grant him a second term.  What happened with the fake electors? After the authorized Democratic electors met at statehouses to formally name Biden as president, in seven battleground states, illegitimate Republican electors arrived too. The Trump electors were turned away but they signed fake election certificates that declared they were the \u201cduly elected and qualified\u201d electors certifying Trump as the winner. What has this got to do with what happened on January 6? The scheme was conceived in an effort to create \u201cdueling\u201d slates of electors that Pence could use to pretend the election was in doubt and refuse to formalize Biden\u2019s win at the congressional certification on January 6.  Texas school shooting: heavily armed police with ballistic shields were there \u2018within 19 minutes\u2019  Police officers armed with rifles and at least one ballistic shield were at the site of the Robb elementary school mass shooting in Texas within 19 minutes, earlier than previously known, according to a timeline in documents reviewed by local media. The information revealed by the Austin American-Statesman and KVUE-TV is to be presented to a public Texas senate hearing in Austin on Tuesday. Concerns have been raised about how police handled the 24 May shooting in Uvalde in which 19 children and two teachers were shot dead by a gunman. Officers did not confront the gunman for more than an hour, even as anguished parents outside the school urged officers to go in. According to the outlets, which did not indicate the source of the documents, investigators said the latest information indicated officers had more than enough firepower and protection to take down the gunman long before they finally did.  Delays in the law enforcement response have been the focus of the federal, state and local investigation of the massacre and its aftermath. Questions about the law enforcement response began days after the massacre. On 2 June, the state senator Roland Gutierrez said there was a \u201csystem failure\u201d.  Ukrainian missiles hit Black Sea gas platforms, say Russian officials  Russian officials have said Ukraine launched missile strikes against three gas rigs in the Black Sea south of Odesa, in an apparent escalation of Kyiv\u2019s attempts to weaken Russia\u2019s maritime dominance. Seven people were missing and three injured after the strikes, according to the head of occupied Crimea, Sergey Aksyonov, who said a \u201crescue operation with the participation of patrol ships and aviation\u201d was under way. The three offshore platforms, the Boyko towers, were seized by Moscow from Ukraine in 2014. Kyiv believes they are used for military reconnaissance and to help assert control of a larger portion of the Black Sea. Meanwhile, The Nobel peace prize that the Russian journalist Dmitry Muratov was auctioning off to raise money for Ukrainian child refugees has sold for $103.5m (\u00a384.5m), shattering the record for a Nobel. \u201cI was hoping that there was going to be an enormous amount of solidarity,\u201d Muratov said after the sale. \u201cBut I was not expecting this to be such a huge amount.\u201d  What else is happening? Here\u2019s what we know on day 118 of the invasion.  In other news \u2026   The fashion industry has been told it must wean itself off cotton from China\u2019s Xinjiang region, as a new law comes into force giving US border authorities greater powers to seize goods linked to forced labour in China. About 20% of the world\u2019s cotton comes from China, and 84% of that comes from Xinjiang. Unidentified operatives have been using the fitness tracking app Strava to spy on members of the Israeli military, tracking their movements across secret bases around the country and potentially observing them as they travel the world on official business. Taiwan has accused China of bullying after organisers of the World Cup in Qatar listed the nationality of Taiwanese visitors applying for an identification card as \u201cChinese Taipei\u201d. China\u2019s foreign ministry expressed its \u201cappreciation\u201d to the Qatari government while Taipei expressed its anger about the references. The confluence of two holidays, Father\u2019s Day and Juneteenth, and a season of \u201crevenge travel\u201d continued to heap pressure on the already stretched airline industry as 4,200 additional US flights were delayed and 900 canceled, pushing the total number of flights interrupted since Thursday to 19,000.  Stat of the day: Russian emails appear to show \u2018network\u2019 holding $4.5bn assets linked to Putin  Palaces, yachts and vineyards reportedly provided to Vladimir Putin by friends and oligarchs can now be linked to what appears to be an informal network holding assets worth more than $4.5bn (\u00a33.7bn). A digital paper trail appears to suggest that an array of holiday homes and other assets reportedly used by the Russian president, which, according to available records, belong to or have been owned by separate individuals, companies and charities, are linked through a common email domain name, LLCInvest.ru. Don\u2019t miss this: Are we responsible for the things we do wrong?  The question of whether we are responsible for the harm we cause goes to the heart of who we think we are, and how we believe society should run, writes Farrah Jarral, Taking a binary approach, whichever path one chooses can lead to difficulties very quickly. On the one hand, if we are solely responsible for the things we do wrong, some genuinely malevolent parties get off scot-free. On the other, if we locate responsibility entirely outside the individual, we relegate ourselves to sentient flotsam buffeted by currents beyond our control. \u2026 Or this: Juneteenth celebrations over time \u2013 in pictures  The abolitionist Frederick Douglass asked in a famous speech in 1852: \u201cWhat to the American slave is your fourth of July?\u201d For formerly enslaved persons, Juneteenth, celebrated in the US today, was their freedom story. Today, it\u2019s commemorated by their descendants and an entire nation. Last year, Joe Biden signed a law designating 19 June (Juneteenth, for short) as a federal holiday. Here\u2019s a look at the celebrations over time. Climate check: Truthful climate reporting shifts viewpoints, but only briefly, study finds  People\u2019s views of the climate crisis can be influenced by the media, according to new research. But accurate scientific reporting has limited impact on people who already have a fixed political viewpoint, particularly if they are opposed to climate action. Researchers who ran an experiment in the US found that people\u2019s views of climate science really were shifted by reading reporting that accurately reflected scientific findings and were more willing to back policies that would tackle the problem. But the effect quickly faded.

                    "body": "If you drink one of the 2bn cups of coffee consumed each day worldwide, you may have seen headlines last month celebrating the coffee pod, a single-serving container \u2013 typically made of plastic or aluminum \u2013 that can be inserted into a machine to brew a cup of coffee.  New analysis found that coffee pods may be more environmentally friendly than filter coffee, making headlines in the Washington Post and the BBC. But could it really be true? Some experts and coffee enthusiasts questioned how good for the planet pods actually are, especially given the waste that coffee capsules notoriously produce. But some scholars maintain that \u2013 even though it\u2019s important to consider how capsules are disposed of \u2013 most greenhouse gas emissions happen while coffee is being grown. So reducing how much coffee you use, even if that takes using a coffee pod, can decrease the emissions of your coffee habit. \u201cIt hurts to know that we create so much waste,\u201d Luciano Rodrigues Viana, one of the researchers behind the new study and a doctoral student in environmental sciences at the University of Quebec at Chicoutimi, said in an email. But even if there were no coffee capsules in the world tomorrow, abandoning them \u201cwould make no contribution to reducing greenhouse gas emissions\u201d. The original analysis Last month, a team of researchers at the University of Quebec at Chicoutimi published an analysis looking at the greenhouse gas emissions associated with making a cup of coffee four different ways: with a French press, instant coffee, filter or single-serving capsule. What they found surprised many readers. In certain cases, a traditional filter coffee machine can produce 1.5 times as many emissions as a coffee pod, despite the aluminum or plastic waste users are left to toss in the trash.  That\u2019s because \u201ccoffee capsules avoid the overuse of coffee and water\u201d, the article\u2019s authors write, by precisely measuring the correct amount of ingredients. Left to measure on their own, many coffee drinkers use 20% more coffee and twice as much water as is actually needed to brew a cup of filtered coffee. And growing that extra coffee emits more greenhouse gases than manufacturing and throwing away coffee capsules, the analysis found. Producing 11g of Arabica coffee in Brazil \u2013 the amount that can be saved by using a coffee pod \u2013 emits about 59g of CO2 equivalent, about twice as much as the 27g of CO2 equivalent emitted by creating and disposing of those same pods. It makes sense that we intuitively think \u201cpods are obviously worse for the environment because we use them and throw them in the waste\u201d, but that \u201cusing double the amount of coffee to make a filter coffee is not a problem\u201d, said Viana. But the work that goes into producing coffee beans is actually \u201cmuch more polluting\u201d. The difference is that consumers don\u2019t see it. However you prepare your coffee, the production of the coffee beans is the most greenhouse gas-emitting phase in the coffee lifecycle, contributing between 40% and 80% of coffee\u2019s total emissions. That\u2019s a result of how the agricultural sector uses intensive irrigation, fertilizers and pesticides to increase the yield of coffee plants \u2013 and contributes to vast deforestation in the countries where coffee is grown. What do other scientists say? Viana said he wasn\u2019t surprised by his team\u2019s findings, but was surprised by the media attention they received, because \u201cwe are not the first to report similar findings\u201d. The Conversation \u2013 where the article was originally published \u2013 is a nonprofit newsroom focused on sharing academic stories with the general public, but is not an academic or scientific journal. Viana expects that he and his colleagues will publish a peer-reviewed paper on the same subject later this year. But the results are hardly new: an engineering professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison conducted a similar analysis in 2017, and a team of Swiss researchers published similar results in 2007. Although most researchers agree that coffee pods produce fewer emissions than filter coffee, that\u2019s not to say there aren\u2019t other, more environmentally friendly ways of making a cup of coffee \u2013 or that the impacts of coffee pods are equal in every city or country. In 2021, a team of Italian researchers found that using a Moka pot, a stovetop coffee maker popular in Europe and Latin America, can produce significantly fewer greenhouse gasses than a capsule. (The study said that because of the extra packaging and post-consumer waste disposal, \u201cthe preparation of a cup of coffee with a coffee with a coffee pod or capsule machine would result in extra emissions of 27.6 or 12.6g CO2e with respect to those emitted with an induction Moka pot, respectively\u201d.) Even the Canadian team\u2019s analysis found that instant coffee had fewer emissions.  Mauro Moresi, an engineering professor at the Accademia dei Georgofili and one of the researchers on the 2021 Italian study, agreed that in all cases he and his team examined, \u201cthe coffee bean cultivation and green coffee production phase represented the primary hotspot.\u201d He notes that production-related emissions can vary from country to country, depending on how vast the scale of deforestation for example, so it\u2019s important to consider where your coffee comes from. But the waste! Just because capsules produce fewer greenhouse gases than filtered coffee doesn\u2019t mean the waste they produce isn\u2019t a problem, says Viana. Globally, coffee capsules make up about 576,000 metric tons of waste. The number of Keurig cups alone thrown away in 2014 could circle the earth 12 times. Studies like the one Viana and his team are conducting are important, says Andrew Gray, an assistant professor of watershed hydrology at the University of California-Riverside. \u201cIt\u2019s just that, oftentimes, researchers seem to tend to focus in on using one of these kinds of indices for environmental or climate impact \u2013 like CO2 emission to the atmosphere \u2013 and then potentially overlook other kinds of potential impacts on the environment \u2013 like the production of pollution, in this case, plastic pollution.\u201d \u201cA hallmark of the era that we\u2019re living in now, and have been living in for the past couple of decades, is the increasing use of plastic for lots of single-use applications,\u201d said Gray. \u201cPlastics, for a long time, have been thought of as inert substances,\u201d but scientists are starting to increasingly understand their potential impacts on human and animal health, as carcinogens and endocrine disruptors. \u201cThere\u2019s lots of potential cause for concern, especially since we\u2019re finding microplastics everywhere.\u201d The impact of packaging waste \u201cis quite complex and varies according to the disposal scenario used on a local or national basis\u201d, said Moresi. While Keurig Dr Pepper uses plastic derived from fossil fuels to manufacture its pods, Nespresso produces capsules made out of aluminum, which can be recycled in some, but not all, cities. And just because coffee pods can be recycled doesn\u2019t mean they always are \u2013 one study found that only 11% of capsules were recycled in Brazil in 2017. That\u2019s why some cities, like Hamburg, Germany, have banned coffee pods. In an attempt to combat that, the Swiss company Migros launched a new \u201ccoffee balls\u201d machine late last year. Instead of using plastic or aluminum, Migros\u2019 coffee balls are coated in a seaweed-based covering, which it says makes the balls fully compostable. Viana explains that coffee could become one of the \u201cmain victims\u201d of the climate crisis, as the amount of the world\u2019s land area suitable for coffee production diminishes. It\u2019s key, he and his coauthors write, that coffee producers and suppliers \u201ctake action to reduce the environmental and social impacts of coffee production\u201d."

                    "body": "The UK has drastically increased the volume of natural gas being pumped to the EU amid Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine, powering a record monthly rise in goods exports to the continent despite Brexit. Figures from the Office for National Statistics show EU goods exports rose for the third consecutive month to \u00a316.4bn in April, the highest monthly level in current prices since comparable records began in 1997. Reflecting the impact of the war in Ukraine as EU nations seek to diversify energy supplies away from Russia, the data suggests the UK is acting as a hub for liquified natural gas (LNG) imports from the rest of the world before pumping it through pipelines to the continent.  UK fuel exports rose by \u00a3500m on the month, driven by gas and crude oil to the Netherlands and Ireland, in a sign of heightened demand on the continent to refill gas storage sites in the run-up to winter. Much of the rise in total goods exports was driven by the rising value of fuel prices rather than volumes of other products. After adjusting for inflation, goods exports were the highest since December 2020, the last month before the Brexit transition ended. Vladimir Putin\u2019s invasion of Ukraine has contributed to a dramatic rise in global energy prices amid concern over the security of supply, fuelling the highest rates of inflation for decades in several countries including the UK. EU nations reliant on Russia for much of their energy have sought alternative supplies while reducing imports in response to the war. Analysts said EU countries such as Germany lacked LNG terminal facilities. Jack Sirett, the head of dealing at Ebury, a financial services firm, said: \u201cThe UK is a key global importer of the fuel which it then exports to Europe via pipeline, particularly given small storage capability in the UK.\u201d The UK is home to three of the largest terminals in Europe for converting LNG back into gas, two at Milford Haven in Pembrokeshire and the other at the Isle of Grain in north Kent. Imports to these sites have risen sharply from the US and Qatar as western governments move to reduce their reliance on Russian supplies.  The ONS said UK exports to Russia fell to the lowest monthly value since January 1999, while monthly imports fell to the lowest since March 2004. Although the UK has among the highest LNG terminal capacities in Europe, it has among the smallest storage facilities to build stockpiles in the run-up to winter. The UK\u2019s biggest gas storage plant, the Rough facility in the North Sea, was closed in 2017 after the government refused to subsidise maintenance and upgrades needed to keep it open. HSBC estimates Europe\u2019s four biggest storage holders \u2013 Germany, Italy, the Netherlands and France \u2013 have capacity equivalent to more than a quarter of annual consumption, while the UK has only 2% of annual demand. This makes the UK more dependent on domestic production, pipeline and LNG imports."

                    "body": "It is more than 30 years since I saw Pablo Picasso\u2019s Guernica face to face, as it were, in Madrid\u2019s Prado Museum, shortly before it was moved into the Museo Reina Sofia, where it still hangs. Painted in 1937 in furious protest at Germany\u2019s bombing of the Basque town of Guernica at the behest of Franco\u2019s nationalist forces during the Spanish civil war, Picasso had refused permission for it to be housed in Spain until the return of democracy. I had seen dozens of images of the painting. But nothing could prepare me for standing in front of it. There was, first, its overwhelming size, something no image can portray. Guernica stands more than 3.49m x 7.76m. You don\u2019t so much view the painting as the painting wraps itself around you and you are drawn into its emotions and intensity. The compression of space, the ambiguity of perspective, the splintering of the bodies, all seem far more pronounced when you view the work in real life. Painted in black and white and muted greys, the absence of colour, again, seems so much more visible in the gallery than it does in any reproduction. I saw details that had otherwise eluded me: the bull\u2019s third eye looking directly out of the canvas; the tension in the arm of the dismembered man clutching a broken sword; the barely visible, half-rubbed-out dove. Standing in front of Picasso\u2019s masterpiece, I was overwhelmed by a sense of dislocation and horror that no reproduction could convey. Thirty years on, the visceral power of Guernica still lives with me. I saw Guernica around the time that a new way of viewing art was coming into being \u2013 the internet. Over the past 30 years, museums and galleries from the Metropolitan Museum in New York to the Museum of Islamic Art in Qatar, from the National Museum in New Delhi to the tiny Lynn Museum in Norfolk, have put much of their collection online, making them available to millions, cultural treasure that would otherwise be denied them. However, the growth of online collections has also generated a fierce debate about the virtues of the physical v the virtual museum, of how the digital should relate to actual. Last week, that debate received a new twist when New York\u2019s Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) announced that it was auctioning off 29 of its physical paintings, including masterpieces by Picasso, Monet and Bacon, to help \u201cestablish an endowment for digital media and technology\u201d. What that means in practice is unclear. What MoMa\u2019s move has done, though, is revive the debate over the merits of the actual and the virtual.  The idea of a virtual museum is not new. Fifty years ago, long before the world wide web came into being, the French novelist, critic and one-time culture minister, Andr\u00e9 Malraux, wrote of a \u201cmuseum without walls\u201d, which collated every person\u2019s ideal collection of art. Writing decades before the internet, the technology that Malraux imagined might make this possible was primitive. The ability that the internet provides museums and galleries to put their collections online brings us closer to a museum without walls; a museum not confined by physical space or by opening and closing times but allowing any number of people access to the collection they want at any time. Online collections also allow us to access information about the object or painting, place it in historical and social context, and link to stories about it, in a way that no physical museum can. And, yet, just as no number of images of Picasso\u2019s Guernica could prepare me for the experience of the actual painting, so no degree of sophistication of a digital experience can reproduce the actuality of seeing a work of art in front of you. Partly, it arises from physical differences, from the importance of texture and size, qualities inherent in a physical object but not in an image on a screen. More importantly, perhaps, there is what the American curator Ann Mintz calls a \u201cmetaphysical\u201d quality in viewing an actual object that is absent from a virtual reproduction. One relates to a physical work of art in a different way to a virtual object. Studies have shown that people spend more time viewing a physical object in a museum than that same object online and often have an emotional response to it in a way that rarely happens in a virtual space. It\u2019s a distinction not confined to art. There is an analogous difference between listening to music at home and experiencing it at a live gig or in an opera house. The music would undoubtedly be far better sonically at home, but there is an inexpressible quality to watching music being produced and performed live, and in the company of others, that no record or CD or stream can imitate. Or take the distinction between watching live sport and watching on TV. There is much to be said for TV sport; not just the comfort of one\u2019s sofa, but also the ability of the camera to pick out moments and details that you would never have seen in a stadium. And yet, nothing can take away from the emotional charge of watching a match in real life, of seeing Mo Salah or Venus Williams perform their miracles in the moment, crammed with thousands of others engaged in the same pursuit. Or even, in its own way, consider the importance for so many people of ritual and physical connection that we have seen this past week. All this tells us something about being human; of the significance of the materiality of our world to our appreciation of it. The importance, too, of the social context in which we engage with the world, of being able to engage with it not as individuals but as part of a crowd or a collective. The internet has transformed our lives and democratised our relationship to art. But in doing so, it has also revealed the significance of the physical and the actual. It has shown us how, paradoxically, the materiality of life embodies an ineffable quality that the virtual cannot match. \u2022 Kenan Malik is an Observer columnist"

The Northern Territory Racing Commission, which regulates most online gambling companies in Australia as they are registered in the territory, described the breach as serious and a warning to other wagering operators. Amused Group, which runs the BetNation brand, emailed 7,713 people as part of its \u201cWho wants to be a millionaire?\u201d campaign, telling them it would accept bets of up to $1,000 on any horse in the Melbourne Cup. Seven hundred and seventy-two people who had asked to be banned through the commission or directly by the company were among the group contacted.  The company then told customers that they could win bonus payments up to $50 if the horse they selected ran second to 10th. In a decision, the commission said it had almost immediately received a complaint from someone who had self-excluded. A further 10 complaints were received from people with \u201cvarying levels of distress and anger at having received the email\u201d. The NT\u2019s responsible online gambling code requires companies \u201cto ensure they have in place suitable procedures to ensure correspondence or promotional material is not sent to any persons who are either excluded from their services, or who request that this information not be sent to them\u201d.  Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup  Guardian Australia contacted Amused for comment. According to thedecision published online, the company told the commission that \u201cemails [were] sent to the wrong client list due to human error\u201d. \u201cAmused promptly sent an email retracting the promotional email, apologising for the error, and advising how to make a complaint about the error,\u201d the decision said. \u201cNo self excluded persons were able to open or reopen an account and place a bet. \u201cCorrective and preventative measures have now been put in place to prevent a recurrence of this type of error in the future.\u201d The commission noted the promotional material had not been sent intentionally. The $13,770 fine is half the maximum amount. \u201cThe commission considers this to be a serious breach, noting the potential for harm to persons who have admitted that they have a gambling problem and have taken positive steps to prevent themselves from opening and operating a betting account,\u201d the decision said. Matt Stevens, an honorary fellow at the Menzies School of Health Research specialising in gambling policy, questioned whether the fine would enforce compliance. \u201cThe fine of $13,770 is a minute amount in comparison to what the companies take from gamblers and particularly those who struggle with problem gambling, such as people who have self-excluded,\u201d Stevens said.  \u201cIn addition to increasing fines to actually make them a real penalty for the company, consideration should be given to suspending licences for a period of time. That would be more effective as a compliance approach.\u201d The commission is able to suspend or cancel gambling licences but decided not to in this case. Dr Samantha Thomas, a gambling expert at Deakin University, raised concerns about a lack of national regulation for online gambling. \u201cA national gambling regulator is urgently needed and should be carefully considered by the current parliamentary inquiry into online gambling,\u201d Thomas said. \u201cConsistent standards should be applied across the country to ensure that companies not only comply with robust regulations for these potentially harmful products, but also that they are appropriately penalised if they do not meet regulator standards.\u201d"

                    "body": "  6.40pm   Match report  Time to sign off for today \u2013 I\u2019ll leave you with Jamie Jackson\u2019s match report from Old Trafford, and we\u2019ll have more reaction and analysis to come on The Guardian dot com. Thanks for joining me, and enjoy your evenings.      6.38pm    Here\u2019s Erik ten Hag: \u201cWe made a great goal, magnificent. Great cross from Eriksen, and Rashford really hammered his header! Second half, we have to manage it better, that\u2019s clear. It turned into, I call it a tennis match, one end to the other \u2013 but we have great defenders, and a great keeper.\u201d The Manchester United manager bristles slightly at suggestions United were hanging on. \u201cWe played Thursday, West Ham rested their team [against Silkeborg], so they had more power in the end. We had to manage the game. The moment for Fred was there, when he hit the post.\u201d He is also not keen to discuss Harry Maguire in detail: \u201cThe team do their job \u2013 defend the goal \u2013 together, as a back four but also, the team defend as 11 players.\u201d Ten Hag is more effusive on Diogo Dalot. \u201cI\u2019m really happy with his development. He\u2019s growing from game to game, he\u2019s really good in possession\u201d \u2013 and Casemiro. \u201cYou can see why he wins Champions Leagues. He is the absolute top of world football.\u201d On Ronaldo: \u201che did quite well \u2013 we asked him to drop deeper, make runs and move defenders around.\u201d What did he make of Pep Guardiola\u2019s claim that United are \u201ccoming back\u201d. \u201cThe spirit we have is fabulous, we have the quality to score goals. But [to catch City] we have a long way to go.\u201d I quite enjoy these pitchside chats with the pundits getting involved \u2013 better than a roll-call of questions from Geoff Shreeves, for me, Clive.  Updated at 6.39pm GMT    6.24pm    \u201cI don\u2019t think we played our best today,\u201d says Marcus Rashford. \u201cDavid was excellent, I don\u2019t know how we saved Zouma\u2019s header. It was tough, but it feels good to come through it.\u201d He is shown a breakdown of his 100 United goals, seven of which are headers. \u201cI need to score more! I\u2019ve got a decent jump, I just need to work on attacking the ball, getting in the right areas.\u201d On his return to form this season, he adds: \u201cIt\u2019s a completely different energy around the whole club [this season], and I feel more motivated now. I\u2019m in a better headspace \u2013 I struggled at times [last year], more mental things, not my performance but things off the pitch \u2013 that\u2019s the biggest difference.\u201d     6.17pm    West Ham will wonder how they failed to find an equaliser, but credit is due to Manchester United\u2019s backline, who produced the kind of gritty, backs-to-the-wall display that\u2019s becoming their trademark under Erik ten Hag.  Lisandro Mart\u00ednez and Diogo Dalot were excellent, and Harry Maguire held his own on his return to the team. When the visitors got beyond them, they found no way past David de Gea. The concern for ten Hag is that the hosts ended up having to dig deep rather than build on their half-time lead.     6.10pm   FT: Manchester United 1-0 West Ham  Areola comes up for a final corner, but Manchester United clear their lines and the referee blows his whistle. Marcus Rashford\u2019s first-half header proves to be enough after a frantic final 10 minutes, with David de Gea making three superb saves.   Updated at 6.12pm GMT    6.08pm    93 mins: Double ooooooof! With time running out, Declan Rice lashes a shot from 30 yards out \u2013 and De Gea makes a sprawling save to deny the midfielder a spectacular leveller!   Updated at 6.10pm GMT    6.07pm    92 mins: Oooooof! Jarrod Bowen connects with Fornals\u2019 low ball across goal but his shot, destined for the far corner, is blocked by Maguire and pinballs off Dalot to safety!     6.05pm    90 mins: Another West Ham delivery is muscled clear, and then from a corner, Frederico Fred is able to bustle downfield. Rather than hold it, he tries a Hollywood ball across goal that floats through to Areola.     6.03pm    89 mins: Fernandes is booked for a weary hack at Soucek\u2019s shins \u2013 it\u2019s his fifth of the season, and means he will miss United\u2019s next league game at Aston Villa.     6.02pm    88 mins: This has been a helter-skelter final 10 minutes after a largely unremarkable second half. United try to break again, but Zouma cuts out Ronaldo\u2019s attempted through ball to Rashford. Three added minutes \u2026     6.00pm    86 mins: Fred hits the post! Manchester United almost release the pressure through an unlikely combination \u2013 McTominay scoops a cross towards the penalty spot, and Frederico Fred\u2019s header clips the outside of the post with Areola on his heels!     5.59pm    84 mins: Another nervy moment as McTominay wrestles with Zouma in the area. The VAR doesn\u2019t intervene, and there wasn\u2019t really enough in it on first viewing.     5.57pm    82 mins: Bigger save from De Gea! West Ham win the ball back from the corner and Cresswell\u2019s cross is met at the near post by Zouma. It looks a certain goal, but De Gea somehow claws it away! Manchester United are living dangerously \u2026   Updated at 6.00pm GMT    5.56pm    80 mins: Big save from David de Gea! This is the closest West Ham have come, with Antonio bending his shot towards the far corner. The keeper springs across and turns the ball behind!     5.53pm    77 mins: Ten Hag takes further steps to tighten things up, completing the \u201cred wall\u201d by replacing Christian Eriksen with Frederico Fred. The hosts are now set up to try and soak up attacks and hit West Ham on the break \u2013 it works here and Kehrer is forced to haul down Rashford, earning a booking.  Updated at 5.55pm GMT    5.51pm    76 mins: Cresswell\u2019s dangerous free kick is flicked across goal, but the unflappable Martinez holds off Dawson at the back post and heads clear.     5.50pm    75 mins: Fernandes wins a free kick, backing into Dawson, but Manchester United again fail to find a killer delivery. At the other end, Casemiro clips Benrahma and West Ham will have a chance to punish them. A second change from Moyes \u2013 Flynn Downes is replaced by Pablo Fornals.     5.47pm    74 mins: Ronaldo drops deeper to collect the ball, turns and sees an ambitious shot blocked. He\u2019s not been bad today by any means, but it still feels like he\u2019s playing a slightly different game to his teammates.     5.46pm    72 mins: Luke Shaw nutmegs Soucek, who hauls the left-back down and gets a booking for his trouble. A chance for Eriksen to whip the ball in, and he floats it towards Maguire at the back post, who opts to nod it backwards rather than across goal.     5.43pm    70 mins: McTominay thuds the ball away and although Benrahma works it back to Cresswell on the left, the full-back\u2019s cross drifts out of play.     5.42pm    68 mins: De Gea gratefully clings on to Benhrama\u2019s slippery shot, with Antonio closing in. The substitute striker has made West Ham look more dangerous, and they have another corner here \u2026     5.41pm    66 mins: From the corner, Benrahma can\u2019t connect with Bowen\u2019s looping ball back into the box. West Ham get it back and Antonio tees up Craig Dawson, who sees his name flash up in lights before slicing his shot into the crowd.     5.39pm    65 mins: United\u2019s corner is cleared and Declan Rice skips away from Rashford and gallops upfield. He plays it wide to Kehrer, whose cross looks destined for Antonio\u2019s head until Dalot makes another impeccably-timed intervention.     5.37pm    63 mins: Another, trickier chance for Ronaldo, who skewers an attempted lob just over the bar. Manchester United are sensing a second goal would probably wrap this up.   Updated at 5.41pm GMT    5.35pm    61 mins: Two chances come and go for Ronaldo! First, he gets on to Shaw\u2019s cross, but can\u2019t steer his header on target. Moments later, he\u2019s played in by Rashford but slaps his shot into the side netting with Fernandes begging for the ball to be cut back.     5.34pm    60 mins: Maguire muscles Bowen off the ball on the edge of the area, and Ten Hag opts to make a change with the visitors getting forward too easily. The peripheral Anthony Elanga is replaced by Scott McTominay, who will shore up the midfield.  Updated at 5.37pm GMT    5.32pm    57 mins: Dalot again gets his head to a cross first \u2013 impressive work, but both times he\u2019s been in the area that should be marshalled by Maguire. At the other end, Casemiro\u2019s cross is blocked by Zouma, leading to cat-calls for handball from the home fans.     5.29pm    55 mins: Dalot races infield to head away a dangerous deep cross from Kehrer. Moyes sacrifices Scamacca, hauling him off in place of Antonio.     5.27pm    52 mins: It\u2019s been a scrappy start to the second half. David Moyes, perhaps fortunate to still have 11 players at his disposal, appears to be readying Michail Antonio to come on.     5.24pm    49 mins: Scamacca gets a sight of goal from Benrahama\u2019s cut-back, but Martinez blocks his shot. Going after the high ball, Scamacca\u2019s boot connects with the centre-back\u2019s head. Free kick, but no second booking for the Italian \u2013 he\u2019s been given the benefit of the doubt by Chris Kavanagh, a decision that looks generous to me.   Updated at 5.29pm GMT    5.20pm    47 mins: Maguire, who is stationed on the right side of defence today, moves across to deal with Scamacca and snuff out an early West Ham attack.     5.18pm   Peep!  The second half begins, and West Ham have changed their keeper. Lukasz Fabianski, who landed awkwardly after making a clearance in the first half, is replaced by Alphonse Areola.   Updated at 5.23pm GMT    5.17pm    The players are heading back out for the second half. In other news, it\u2019s dark outside and I\u2019ve just seen my first Christmas ad of the year. Wake me up in Feb, please.     5.13pm    A half-time question: with Marcus Rashford back in form, should he start England\u2019s World Cup opener with Iran? With Bukayo Saka potentially injured and Raheem Sterling out of form, a path is opening up \u2013 and Gareth Southgate is at Old Trafford today.      5.08pm    \u201cRemember when footballers had time to star in Christmas pantos?\u201d asks Justin Kavanagh. \u201cToday, I suppose Ronaldo would inevitably be cast as Peter Pan or, given his frequent demeanour toward his teammates, Puss in Boots. Speaking of felines, a certain West Ham defender would surely be given the lead in Dick Whittington and His Cat.\u201d     5.02pm    Pertinent half-time reading      5.02pm   Half time: Manchester United 1-0 West Ham  Manchester United lead at the break through Marcus Rashford\u2019s bullet header, and probably just about deserve to be in front. West Ham have had their moments but unlike Ian Holloway\u2019s Blackpool, have lacked a cutting edge. Back soon.   Updated at 5.04pm GMT    5.00pm    44 mins: Manchester United continue on the aerial route, with Fernandes\u2019 cross towards Ronaldo just overhit. There\u2019ll be one minute of added time.     4.58pm    41 mins: West Ham almost strike back immediately, Bowen\u2019s cross-shot looping over De Gea and intercepted by Martinez with Scamacca lurking at the far post.     4.56pm    There seemed to be little danger as Dalot took a throw-in on the right, but Eriksen plays a lovely one-two with Fernandes and then whips a cross towards the back post. Rashford looks isolated in the middle but climbs high above Kehrer and thudded his header beyond Fabianski. Emphatic.   Updated at 6.27pm GMT    4.54pm   GOAL! Manchester United 1-0 West Ham (Rashford 39')  The deadlock is broken by Marcus Rashford, who scores his 100th United goal with an absolutely colossal header!    Updated at 5.00pm GMT    4.53pm    36 mins: The cross is passed back to Shaw, whose cross is flicked off Ronaldo\u2019s forehead by Zouma and lands at the feet of Elanga. His wild effort ends up by the corner flag, where Rashford wins a cheap free kick from Scamacca, who is booked. Eriksen\u2019s delivery is poor, dealt with at the near post.  Updated at 5.22pm GMT    4.51pm    35 mins: Rashford plays in Luke Shaw, in marauding territory down the left \u2013 his cut-back is well blocked by Rice, and Manchester United win another corner \u2026     4.49pm    33 mins: Martinez is posing problems with raking long balls upfield \u2013 this one forces Fabianski to head clear on the edge of his area under pressure from Eriksen, although the Dane is subsequently flagged offside.     4.48pm    31 mins: Ronaldo finds space but his prod forward in the general direction of Bruno Fernandes is easily intercepted. The first murmurs of frustration are heard from around Old Trafford.     4.46pm    30 mins: At the moment it\u2019s West Ham who look the more likely to score, with Manchester United\u2019s early intent petering out slightly. I should qualify that by adding: West Ham don\u2019t actually look that likely to score either.     4.44pm    \u201cWouldn\u2019t it be fairer to the true meaning of the word \u2018United\u2019 if we used it to mean West Ham?\u201d asks James Lacoss. \u201cMaybe Manchester United can be Ronaldo+10 \u2026\u201d     4.43pm    27 mins: West Ham come again, with Thilo Kehrer taking advantage of some defensive hesitancy and slaloming skilfully into the area. He lays the ball off to Bowen, whose shot is saved \u2013 but the flag goes up, anyway.     4.41pm    25 mins: De Gea has to race off his line to clear the danger, with Benrahma again the furthest player forward in tangerine shorts \u2026     4.39pm    23 mins: Benrahma gets another chance to run at Mart\u00ednez one-on-one, the centre-back doing enough to bundle the ball behind from a corner, which is cleared before Benrahma is flagged offside.     4.37pm    21 mins: Another West Ham attack comes to an end as Declan Rice\u2019s hopeful pass is cut out, and Flynn Downes fouls Casemiro to stop a Manchester United break.     4.35pm    19 mins: Zouma heads it clear with Fabianski flailing and West Ham break away, Benrahma prodding the ball into Rice\u2019s path down the left touchline. The ball is ruled to have gone out of play, however. Replays quickly confirm that it had not.     4.34pm    17 mins: Sa\u00efd Benrahma produces a tasty bit of trickery to evade two markers, but he\u2019s lacking support upfield. At the other end, Ronaldo\u2019s cross is turned behind for a corner.   Updated at 4.49pm GMT    4.32pm    15 mins: Manchester United turn up the pressure, with Rashford skipping into the area and seeing his shot deflected just over the bar. Moments later, Rashford rises to meet Elanga\u2019s cross, but his header is straight at Fabianski.     4.30pm    14 mins: Wallop! Casemiro shrugs Benrahma off the ball and finds Ronaldo, who larrups a 25-yard swerving shot in trademark style. Fabianski is right behind it, though.     4.29pm    12 mins: Manchester United\u2019s full-backs are pushing up very high, with Rashford (on the left) and Elanga drifting in from either flank. Eriksen is looking to find space in behind, with Benrahma on hand to nod an attempted through ball back to Fabianski.     4.27pm    10 mins: The game has settled down a touch, with West Ham happy to sit back as their hosts stroke the ball around midfield.     4.25pm    8 mins: This West Ham kit is a bit strange \u2013 it looks like a Blackpool away kit. Memories of the 2010-11 season flooding back.  Updated at 4.25pm GMT    4.23pm    6 mins: Eriksen lifts the ball beyond the visiting defence and Elanga, onside but under pressure, drags his shot wide of the far post. A lively start from both sides, with plenty of attacking intent.     4.21pm    4 mins: A first sight of goal for United* as Casemiro finds Dalot on the right. His low cross lands at Rashford\u2019s feet, but his awkward effort drifts wide. *During this MBM I may, on occasion, refer to Manchester United as United. West Ham United fans, please accept my apologies in advance.     4.19pm    Arsenal 5-0 Nottingham Forest: Here is Simon Mail\u2019s match report from the Emirates.      4.18pm    2 mins: Ronaldo wins a free kick but West Ham pinch the ball back and break away. Benrahma gets beyond Maguire but opts to shoot instead of playing in Jarrod Bowen on the right, and his shot is charged down by Mart\u00ednez.     4.16pm   Peep!  West Ham, in their white-and-peach away kit, quickly win a throw-in deep in Manchester United territory, but nothing comes of it.   Updated at 4.22pm GMT    4.14pm    Both sets of teams are out on the pitch, the Old Trafford crowd in fine voice. Let\u2019s do this \u2026     3.57pm    By the way, this is Manchester United\u2019s final home game in the league until 27 December, when they host Forest. Meanwhile, Qatar v Ecuador kicks off in exactly three weeks\u2019 time. There are many, far more serious issues with this World Cup, but dropping it into the middle of the domestic season is still far from ideal.  Updated at 4.00pm GMT    3.52pm   Full time: Arsenal 5-0 Nottingham Forest  A fine day at the office for Arsenal, although Bukayo Saka going off injured will be a concern for Mikel Arteta. His replacement, Reiss Nelson, scored twice with Gabriel Martinelli, Thomas Partey and Martin \u00d8degaard also on target. Arsenal are back on top, Forest stay bottom.      3.48pm     A strange quirk in our automated stats feed \u2013 Fred\u2019s full name is Frederico Rodrigues de Paula Santos, but it\u2019s fair to say he\u2019s never been known as Frederico Fred. Except for today, in this blog, from this moment forward.     3.46pm    GOAL! Arsenal 5-0 Nottingham Forest It\u2019s a fifth for the league leaders, with Martin \u00d8degaard adding to Forest\u2019s misery. This game is, somewhat curiously, not being shown live in the UK.     3.42pm    Here\u2019s David Moyes: \u201cWe\u2019ve won 10 of the last 15 games \u2013 not a bad run, but we didn\u2019t start well so we\u2019re playing catch-up. Some games we\u2019ve deserved more, others we\u2019ve had good fortune \u2013 but players are getting back into form.\u201d West Ham are currently 13th, but a win today would lift them above Liverpool and into the top half. Last season, they finished only two points behind Manchester United.   Updated at 5.14pm GMT    3.36pm    With Arsenal v Forest not on telly, Sky are giving this one the big pre-game build-up, with players and managers heading out to their pitchside podium for a pre-game chat. Here\u2019s the West Ham captain, Declan Rice:      3.31pm    So, Harry Maguire and Cristiano Ronaldo both start for the hosts today. Erik ten Hag tells Sky Sports that Maguire, who will be captain, \u201cis ready to play\u201d after injury with Victor Lindel\u00f6f unwell. As for Ronaldo, ten Hag says: \u201cwe played a very good game on Thursday, he did well, and that\u2019s why we chose him.\u201d Antony is not in the match day squad, but it\u2019s not punishment for showing off. \u201cHe\u2019s injured, not too bad, I hope it will just be a couple of days,\u201d his manager confirms. Asked about the recent coverage of Ronaldo and Antony, he says: \u201ca lot of issues, never a dull moment! [But] we are making progress, going in the right direction, and there is a good spirit overall.\u201d Ronaldo offered a hug and handshake to Louis Saha before the game, but gave the cold shoulder to fellow former teammate and pundit, Gary Neville. Ouch!   Updated at 5.15pm GMT    3.22pm   Team news  Manchester United (4-2-3-1): De Gea; Dalot, Maguire, Mart\u00ednez, Shaw; Casemiro, Eriksen; Elanga, Bruno Fernandes, Rashford; Ronaldo. Subs: Malacia, Fred, Sancho, Pellistri, Dubravka, van de Beek, McTominay, Garnacho, Bishop. West Ham (4-2-3-1): Fabianski; Kehrer, Dawson, Zouma, Cresswell; Soucek, Rice; Bowen, Downes, Benrahma; Scamacca. Subs: Areola, Johnson, Coufal, Fornals, Antonio, Lanzini, Areola, Ogbonna, Coventry, Emerson.  Updated at 3.22pm GMT    3.17pm    GOAL! Arsenal 4-0 Nottingham Forest And now it\u2019s four, Thomas Partey getting on the scoresheet. It\u2019s turning into a long afternoon for the visitors, the optimism gained from victory over Liverpool disappearing fast.     3.15pm    Premier League latest: Arsenal 3-0 Nottingham Forest In Sunday\u2019s earlier kick-off, Arsenal are on course to regain top spot in the table \u2013 they lead the bottom club, Nottingham Forest, 3-0 early in the second half. The bad news for Arsenal, and possibly England too, is that Bukayo Saka went off in the first half with what looked like a knee injury. Saka set up Gabriel Martinelli to open the scoring after five minutes, but was replaced by Reiss Nelson 20 minutes later. Nelson has taken his opportunity with both hands, scoring twice after the restart to put the hosts in total control.     3.15pm   Preamble  There are plenty of places David Moyes would rather spend a Sunday afternoon than Old Trafford. In 17 visits here, he has picked up just one win \u2013 throw in the eight home defeats suffered in his solitary season as Manchester United manager, and you can understand why he might have preferred a brisk walk and pub lunch today. Worse news for Moyes: the trips are getting ever more frequent. This is West Ham\u2019s sixth visit to Old Trafford since the post-lockdown resumption in 2020. On the bright side, every game has been a tight tussle. The Hammers won 1-0 in last season\u2019s League Cup while the other four meetings ended in a 1-1 draw and three 1-0 defeats, one an extra-time loss in the FA Cup. We can probably expect another close encounter today, with both teams recovering well from iffy starts to the season. West Ham have one defeat in their last 11 games, while the derby defeat was Manchester United\u2019s only loss in eight. Admittedly, both those records are boosted by some Europa stat-padding, with neither side\u2019s retooled forward lines quite clicking into gear yet. Moyes may also have a sympathetic word or two for Erik ten Hag, who is making tangible progress in what looked an impossible job: turning his rabble of disgruntled superstars into a well-drilled collective. All while fielding questions on Cristiano Ronaldo\u2019s state of mind and Antony\u2019s soccer skills workshop against Sheriff Tiraspol. Who\u2019d be a manager, eh? Kick-off is at 4.15pm, GMT.  "

                    "body": "When Everton football club kicked off its latest project to build a new stadium, its owner, Farhad Moshiri, promised supporters he would do whatever it took to get it built. \u201cI\u2019ll throw as much money as needed,\u201d the businessman told the club\u2019s annual meeting in 2019. \u201cIt is no luxury, we have to get it done. If we want to have a big club we need a modern stadium and we will get it.\u201d The \u00a3500m project represented the club\u2019s latest effort to leave its famous, if creaking, Goodison Park home \u2013 where one of the original 12 founding members of the Football League first played in 1892. Previous attempts to move, dating back to the 1990s, had been aborted. But, as Moshiri addressed supporters and shareholders, Everton fans felt reassured, as they now had an owner whom the Sunday Times Rich List valued as a billionaire plus the backing of a city council promising a \u00a3280m loan to help fund the project. Many must have believed that their once glorious club, which last lifted a trophy by winning the FA Cup in 1995, was finally on the brink of a new dawn.  Only now \u2013 with Moshiri reportedly in talks to sell a stake in the club and problems mounting at Goodison Park \u2013 some fans are debating if that new dawn may turn into a false one. The chosen new site at Bramley-Moore Dock \u2013 the northernmost point of the Liverpool Maritime Mercantile City \u2013 was cited by Unesco as one reason for stripping the city\u2019s historic trading zone of its world heritage site status in 2021. Then, an agreed \u00a330m naming rights option for the new stadium with Moshiri\u2019s long-term business partner, Alisher Usmanov, was cancelled \u2013 after the oligarch was sanctioned in March following Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine.  But, perhaps most significant of all, Everton backed away from the 2018 local authority funding deal and, in May 2022, Everton agreed to pay \u00a3502,000 of the \u00a3841,000 in costs Liverpool city council expended in exploring the loan. The events surrounding that deal also drew official scrutiny from Liverpool city council commissioners, who were imposed by central government last year to oversee improvements at the local authority. They concluded that local officials had \u201cincurred significant expenditure to investigate the possibility of a loan to EFC without any formal approval and without any budget provision approval\u201d. All of this raises questions about the new 52,888-seat stadium and how this grand old football club is financed.  No backers Everton has been attempting to find financial backers to build its new stadium for years \u2013 eventually hiring the US investment bank JP Morgan and Japan\u2019s largest bank, MUFG, to help raise the \u00a3500m required in January 2020. Despite those two financial institutions searching for funds, financial backing has still to be secured almost three years on \u2013 and Everton has chosen an unorthodox route to start construction. Experts told the Guardian that the usual method of financing new stadiums was to secure all the funds required before a shovel is thrust into the ground \u2013 even though clubs then typically refinance projects at a later date. Everton alighted on a different course: relying on Moshiri\u2019s backing to start work before all the investment capital was raised \u2013 which the club argues should now allow it to access cheaper debt to complete the project, as it has been made less risky. Certainly the site presents unusual challenges that may warrant an unorthodox funding model, as few football grounds are constructed over water. Built in 1848, Bramley-Moore Dock was primarily used for coal \u2013 both for export and to supply it for steamships. The site was in use for 140 years, but as coal-fired steamships fell out of use, and then the coalmines in south Lancashire closed, demand disappeared, leading to its shuttering in 1988. Everton then \u201cinfilled\u201d the dock with sand and compacted the upper six metres by dropping a nine-tonne weight at a frequency of 60 times a minute, in order to prepare the surface for the construction project. Despite those quirky surroundings and the resultant construction challenges, Everton is confident about its big project, repeatedly showcasing progress to fans over recent weeks. And why not? Assuming the final tranche of funding arrives, there should be no problem for either Everton or Moshiri, who owns 94% of the club\u2019s shares.  But the search for funds to finish the stadium \u2013 especially in the current financial climate and as neighbour Liverpool potentially seeks a buyer \u2013 threatens to become a larger issue with each day that passes without a deal, as it seems Everton could face a big bill if, for some reason, the project is not completed. The Guardian understands that if the stadium is not finished, Everton is obliged to pay to return Bramley-Moore Dock to the condition in which it found it. Experts suggested that such a bill could run to tens \u2013 if not hundreds \u2013 of millions of pounds. Everton said it was highly improbable it would have to pay those costs and declined to disclose its current estimate of this liability.  All of that means that while funding to complete the stadium is being sought, financiers expect searching questions about the club\u2019s accounts to be asked by its auditors \u2013 whoever they prove to be. In October, the Guardian revealed that Everton was searching for a new auditor after its existing firm, BDO, had refused to work on the current accounts and was considering walking away. Everton is now understood to be looking for a replacement, in order to meet a March deadline to publish its figures. Its lawyers said: \u201cThe club\u2019s audit will be published in line with normal practice and within the regulatory timetable.\u201d  Offshore loans The questions being raised about the club\u2019s finances are not confined to Bramley-Moore Dock: the source of funds fuelling the Premier League team\u2019s day-to-day operations is also not entirely clear. An analysis of Everton\u2019s publicly available filings suggests the club has run up a debt of about \u00a3150m with an opaque lender of offshore funds. Using specialist sports funders \u2013 which are typically more expensive than conventional banks \u2013 is common within football, as mainstream lenders have grown reluctant to lend to clubs, fearing a backlash from fans if financial relations sour. However, Everton\u2019s reliance on this type of credit line is a noticeable switch from the early part of Moshiri\u2019s reign at the club. Shortly after the businessman acquired an initial 50% share in 2016, Everton\u2019s lenders consisted of well-known banks including Barclays, Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, and Spain\u2019s Santander.  Today, the majority of Everton\u2019s current external loans \u2013 largely secured on property around Goodison Park \u2013 have been taken out with a company called Rights and Media Funding Limited (RMFL), a small player in the world of financing that has also lent money to West Ham United, Nottingham Forest and Spanish top-flight teams. However, while it has two directors, the company does not possess a single employee, according to its latest set of unaudited accounts. Nor does the lender have a website, a phone number or a Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) registration \u2013 although Everton erroneously claimed to the Guardian that the firm was regulated. RMFL, meanwhile, said it did not need to be regulated, \u201cas it is not undertaking regulated activity\u201d. But what RMFL lacks in corporate accoutrements, it makes up for in confidence. Lawyers for the Cheshire-based firm said its client competed with some of the largest names in sports financing, and stated: \u201cRMFL\u2019s competitors in this area are \u2026 the likes of Ares, Blackstone, Apollo, Macquarie, MSD, CVC, TPG \u2026\u201d All of those companies have many billions of dollars under management, yet RMFL had just \u00a3190m by June 2021, itself borrowed from anonymous sources based in offshore secrecy jurisdictions including the Bahamas, the Isle of Man and the British Virgin Islands, official filings suggest. Having borrowed \u00a3190m, RMFL then lent that money out again. Strikingly, at that point, more than half of it \u2013 about \u00a3100m via three loans \u2013 was owed by Everton, according to official records. Everton would not say if it knew the identity of the ultimate source of the funds bankrolling its operations \u2013 but its owner and board appear to have been confident enough in the money\u2019s provenance to have gone back for more. Since June 2021, the team\u2019s debt to RMFL is believed to have ballooned to \u00a3150m, with the extra borrowing revealed by two further charges on the club\u2019s assets filed at Companies House.  While the first four of Everton\u2019s five RMFL loans are guaranteed against property, the collateral on the most recent debt is unclear. Neither Everton nor RMFL would disclose exactly what underpins that final loan \u2013 but both said the debt complied with Premier League rules. RMFL added: \u201cThe Premier League is fully aware of, and has approved, every single facility advanced by RMFL to Premier League clubs.\u201d But the statement appears confusing for two reasons: first, loans secured against real estate do not need Premier League consent; and, second, RMFL\u2019s claim that its loans are all approved was directly contradicted by the Premier League to the Guardian. RMFL later said it was its \u201capproach\u201d that had been approved by the league. So why would a prestigious top-flight football club \u2013 with an owner whose wealth is estimated at \u00a31.7bn and whp therefore should have a phonebook of top banking contacts \u2013 choose to finance itself in this way? Again, the responses pose as many questions as they answer.  Moshiri said that Everton had been borrowing from RMFL before he bought into the club, in a relationship that dated back 11 years. \u201cOver these 11 years and 12 seasons, the club has worked with RMFL in all but three seasons,\u201d he said through a spokesman. Yet RMFL started appearing in Everton\u2019s financial filings only seven years ago in 2015. An analysis of the club\u2019s Companies House filings suggests that Moshiri\u2019s statement could make sense if Everton\u2019s owner considers RMFL to be linked to Vibrac, a controversial former lender of offshore funds to football clubs whose business model was cited as a reason behind a 2018 change in Premier League rules. Such a link has long been rumoured within football finance circles, but RMFL\u2019s lawyers flatly denied it . They told the Guardian there was \u201cno common ownership or control at all between those entities\u201d and said the lender had its own sources of funding.  Everton added it was confident its overall finances were robust and that the stadium would be built on time.   A spokesman for Moshiri said he was \u201cperplexed\u201d by the Guardian\u2019s questions about the club\u2019s finances and suggested there was no public interest in analysing the club\u2019s funding. He added that Everton was in rude financial health with access and relationships to a range of well-known lenders. As evidence of the club\u2019s robust finances, the owner also said that Everton had low borrowings \u2013 pointing to net debts of \u00a358.2m to the end of June 2021. That figure is correct and comes directly from the club\u2019s accounts \u2013 but it is arguably not quite the full story as it masks the size of the owner\u2019s contribution: arcane accounting standards mean that a further \u00a3248.2m in \u201cloans\u201d owed to Moshiri when the accounts were filed have been classified as \u201cequity\u201d."

Before I go, let\u2019s recap the day\u2019s big stories:  Aged care workers will get a 15% pay rise, the Fair Work Commission has announced. The impact of the most recent NSW floods eclipses the February-March flooding. Flood water is running into Forbes CBD with homes expected to be inundated. The federal government is prepared to take action if energy suppliers do not cooperate on power prices, the prime minister, Anthony Albanese, says. The Greens call for an electricity bill freeze, paid for by a windfall tax on coal, oil and gas companies. NSW records 24 Covid deaths and 809 people in hospital. Victoria records 24 Covid deaths and 231 people in hospital. Queensland records 14 Covid deaths and 105 people in hospital. The ACT records one Covid death and 37 people in hospital. Thousands more seniors are to get access to the healthcare card. Anthony Albanese says Scott Morrison was \u201calone\u201d among world leaders in not denouncing the US Capitol riots. Daniel Andrews courts the votes of Victorian dog owners with a $13m commitment for six new parks. The Reserve Bank of Australia says inflation will peak at 8%.

Updated at 8.14am GMT    7.31am    Queensland Star casino investigators expect \u2018outcome\u2019 in coming month The federal money-laundering watchdog is expecting to have an \u201coutcome\u201d from a joint investigation into Star Entertainment\u2019s Queensland casinos in the next month, AAP reports. The Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre (Austrac) and Queensland police have confirmed an investigation into Star, launched in January with the state\u2019s gaming regulator, is still under way. The watchdog says the probes, which involve \u201ccomplex issues of fact and law\u201d, and enforcement actions, can take two years. The agency says it will soon finalise the investigation into the ASX-listed casino operator in Queensland. \u201cAustrac\u2019s investigations into Star are nearing completion, with an outcome expected in the coming month,\u201d the watchdog said in a statement on Friday. The results of that probe will come close to the 25 November deadline Star\u2019s been given to show cause as to why it should not face disciplinary action after being declared unfit to hold its two Queensland casino licences.   Updated at 7.42am GMT    7.23am    Australian share market ends week on a high note The local share market has turned around a lacklustre morning with a respectable afternoon performance to finish the week on a high note, AAP reports. The benchmark S&amp;P/ASX200 index finished Friday up 34.6 points, or 0.5%, to 6,892.5, while the broader All Ordinaries gained 38.7 points, or 0.55%, to 7,089.3. \u201cIt actually performed pretty well, driven by pretty strong resource and energy gains,\u201d the Tribeca Investment Partners portfolio manager Jun Bei Liu said. \u201cThere is a bit of money being deployed back into the market into a small way,\u201d with those funds going into the larger names, she said. Liu said that there wasn\u2019t much news driving the market on Friday ahead of key US monthly jobs data that will be released late Friday night Australia time. For the week the ASX200 rose 106.8 points, or 1.57%, its second winning week in a row.  Updated at 7.30am GMT    7.15am    Labor to reassess 18 proposed oil and gas projects Federal environment officials have agreed to look again at 18 proposed new coal and gas projects after a Queensland environment group submitted requests to have the effects of climate change considered.  None of the 18 projects has been approved under the country\u2019s environment law, but have been through a process where the environment minister determines the nature and scale of their likely impacts.   Updated at 7.21am GMT    7.04am    Aged &amp; Community Care Providers Association welcomes 15% pay rise The ACCPA CEO, Tom Symondson, said:  We note the decision does not cover staff not involved in direct care such as kitchen, laundry, recreation activities and administrative staff, and we look forward to a further decision by the Commission which addresses their pay.ACCPA has been engaged with the work value case since late 2020 and we are delighted that the federal government has committed to fully fund the pay increase for aged care workers resulting from this case.We look forward to working with the relevant unions and the government on the implementation and timing of this important decision so that funding from the government flows at the same time as the pay increase.Higher pay for aged care workers is a key step towards achieving successful and long-lasting aged care reform as identified by the Royal Commission into Aged Care Quality and Safety.A better paid workforce means we can attract more workers into aged care and make our sector an employer of choice. This decision also helps recognise the incredible value that that aged care workers provide to older people.Most importantly, a better paid workforce means a higher quality of care for older Australians enabling them to live their best lives.   Updated at 7.07am GMT    6.54am    WA reports 6,874 new Covid cases, 17 deaths since September The statement from WA Health:  WA Health is reporting a total of 6,874 new cases in the past week to 4pm yesterday 3 November 2022. As of 4pm yesterday, there were 4,387 active cases in Western Australia. Sadly, this week\u2019s report to 4pm yesterday includes 17 deaths, dating back to 23 September 2022, which were reported to WA Health in the last week, aged from 67 to 96 years. Total PCR tests for the timeframe were 8,674. Total positive PCR tests for the timeframe were 1,621. Total positive rapid antigen tests (RATs) in this period were 5,253. WA has recorded 1,181,640 cases since the COVID-19 pandemic began.   Updated at 6.59am GMT    6.43am    Forbes faces worst flooding in 70 years Water is lapping behind shops in Forbes as stressed locals wait for the worst flooding in the central-west NSW town in 70 years, AAP is reporting. Emergency services have 22 emergency evacuation warnings out across the state including for Wagga Wagga, Gunnedah and Moama. Some evacuations have been in place for more than two weeks.  Premier Dominic Perrottet visited Forbes on Friday where the overflowing Lachlan River could by evening exceed 10.8 metres, a mark not reached since 1952. About 1,000 people have been told to leave for higher ground. \u201cFollow those evacuation orders, even if you don\u2019t see flooding around you,\u201d Mr Perrottet said. \u201cThat\u2019s the best way to keep you and your family safe.\u201d He said 50 Australian Defence Force personnel will be deployed in Forbes, with about 200 available for flooded communities around NSW. SES senior manager Ashley Sullivan said the ADF is helping with night-time rescue capability, and support is on the way to communities in preparation of significant expected flooding. \u201cThe ground that we\u2019re standing on here will be inundated later today,\u201d Sullivan said from Forbes, where floodwaters could be seen behind him. The flood peak about 20km upstream of Forbes on Friday morning was expected to reach the township by evening, the Bureau of Meteorology said.  Updated at 6.51am GMT    6.29am    And a statement from Health Services Union on pay rise \u2026 The Health Services Union has welcomed the 15% interim pay rise awarded to parts of the aged care workforce but says a larger and broader increase is needed to stem the industry\u2019s crisis.The interim decision relates to the HSU equal value case in the Fair Work Commission, which the union launched two years ago.The Commission made clear today\u2019s decision which applies to direct care workers but excludes some classifications, is only stage one of three stages in its decision. Gerard Hayes, HSU national president said:  This is a reasonable start but we need the Commission to go further and permanently end the poverty wage settings that dominate aged care. Fifteen percent is a down payment but nobody should be mistaken. This will not fix the crisis. We still have massive unfinished business in aged care. For the last decade this industry has relied on the goodwill of an exploited, casualised workforce. Today represents progress, but the legal, political and industrial fight continues. We won\u2019t rest until we get some semblance of decency and sustainability into aged care.   Updated at 6.35am GMT    6.17am   Fair Work Commission confirms 15% pay rise for aged care workers  Aged care workers will get a 15% pay rise after a Fair Work Commission decision accepted the arguments the sector\u2019s workers were underpaid. The FWC released its decision on Friday afternoon. It is not the full 25% unions had wanted, but it will go some of the way to address one of the biggest issues in the sector \u2013 the underpayment of staff. Workplace minister Tony Burke said it was a step in the right direction. \u201cAged care work is hard work \u2013 but it\u2019s undervalued work,\u201d he said.\u201cThis result is the first step in changing that. \u201cWe fought for this pay rise because our government is committed to getting wages moving again \u2013 particularly in low-paid female-dominated industries like this one.\u201d  The pay rise is good news for aged care workers, but will put pressure on other areas within the care sector, including childcare, with fears a pay rise in one part of the sector will cause further shortages in others.  Updated at 8.13am GMT    5.58am    Football Australia urged to back compensation fund for migrant workers injured or killed in Qatar Football Australia has been presented with a petition of almost 5,500 signatures calling on the organisation to publicly support a compensation fund for migrant workers injured \u2013 and the families of those killed \u2013 working on preparations for the Qatar World Cup.  Be Slavery Free, a charity focused on ending slavery, presented the petition to Football Australia on Friday. The petition states:  When Qatar was awarded the 2022 World Cup, almost 12 years ago, it had very little infrastructure (3 football stadiums) or labour (1 million population) to support such a mammoth global event. In the years since, thousands of migrant workers, mostly from Asia and Africa, flocked to the Gulf state to make the Fifa World Cup possible. Alarming reports of abuse, exploitation and forced labour of workers resulting in serious harm and death have not ceased since. However, very little has been done to remedy the situation.  In a statement, Be Slavery Free said: \u201cLast week, Football Australia and the Socceroos both released statements supporting the establishment of a Migrant Workers Centre but they have stopped short of calling for reparations for the workers who have been injured and the 6,500 or more families who have lost loved ones. \u201cWith global partners Freedom United, Be Slavery Free is asking Football Australia to publicly support a compensation fund for migrant workers, equivalent to the prize money of US$440m. Football Australia was given a petition of almost 5,500 signatures asking for this.\u201d Controversy has surrounded Qatar\u2019s World Cup preparations, particularly over consistent human rights abuses against migrant workers, and the rights of LGBTQ+ people in the country. The president of Fifa, Gianni Infantino, took the unusual step this week of writing to all 32 competing nations at this month\u2019s World Cup, urging them to \u201clet football take the stage\u201d in Qatar.  The Be Slavery Free directors Fuzz Kitto and Carolyn Kitto met with Football Australia\u2019s chief operating officer, Mark Falvo, and shared their first-hand experiences of lives being transformed and slavery prevented through football. Before the last World Cup, Carolyn Kitto met with the Street Child World Cup team in Bujumbura, Burundi. Fuzz and Carolyn Kitto have both seen football be a healer of tensions between communities in places like Egypt, the Palestinian territories and Israel. \u201cIt is remarkable how a round ball and a piece of shared flat earth can bring down barriers and grow community and even friendships. It can cross ethical tensions, political and religious differences and even overcome barriers to peace,\u201d Fuzz Kitto says. In India, they have seen how the charity Oasis uses football as a means to build positive behaviour and strengthen character and purpose among children at risk of being recruited into begging gangs and other forms of slavery. Carolyn Kitto says:  Football builds confidence and a positive sense of future in places from refugee camps to slums as well as being one of the most elite and well-paying sports in the world. A positive legacy of this World Cup must include Fifa contributing to make right some of the abuse now undeniably associated with them.   Updated at 6.31am GMT    5.48am    NSW parliament to debate land tax following inquiry An inquiry that delayed the debate of a NSW government plan allowing more first home buyers to avoid stamp duty has recommended debate go ahead, AAP has reported. The upper house had already referred the Property Tax (First Home Buyer Choice) Bill 2022 to an inquiry before it passed the lower house last month. The bill seeks to begin a two-year trial in January allowing first home buyers to choose an annual land tax rather than paying upfront stamp duty on properties up to $1.5m. Existing concessions and exemptions are available for first home buyers purchasing property under $800,000. The government says it will help more first home buyers get their first property sooner by removing the need for them to save up more money for stamp duty. Labor has smeared the bill as placing a \u201cforever tax\u201d on the family home that will cost the government revenue. The committee received 15 submissions and held one public hearing, making one recommendation for the upper house to proceed with a debate, addressing concerns identified by stakeholders in the inquiry.  Updated at 5.57am GMT    5.36am    School in northern Victoria evacuated over flood levee fears A school in northern Victoria was evacuated amid concerns about the integrity of a nearby flood levee, AAP reports. Emergency Victoria strongly advised people in and near the Koondrook primary school to evacuate due to flood waters encroaching towards the top of the levee and the school\u2019s location on an effective riverside peninsula. \u201cThere\u2019s a danger that if the levee is breached, water could isolate the school to become an island and then it might be hard to get people off there,\u201d a Victorian State Emergency Service spokesman said. The warning triggered a response from the state education department to officially close the school and parents were contacted to collect their children. There was no immediate threat to the broader area. There are more than 50 flood hazard warnings active across Victoria and more than 460 roads remain closed. Major warnings remain in place at Echuca, Lower Moira, Barmah and the Murray downstream of Tocumwal to Barham.  Updated at 5.53am GMT    5.22am    Refugee from Sierra Leone named Tasmania Australian of the Year A migrant and refugee advocate who escaped war-torn Sierra Leone 19 years ago has been named the Tasmania Australian of the Year for 2023, AAP reports. John Kamara, who started a new life in the island state after arriving as a refugee, was on Friday recognised for his work assisting migrants, refugees and people from culturally diverse communities. Kamara, 38, co-founded the Culturally Diverse Alliance of Tasmania, as well as the African Communities Council of Tasmania which strives to build relationships between African Australians and the wider community. He and wife, Mavis, also established Kamara\u2019s Heart Foundation, a charity to assist children in Sierra Leone. Kamara sits on multiple boards, helps migrants with resumes and house hunting and founded a community choir to share and explore music of different cultures. The Tasmania Senior Australian of the Year award was given to the doctor, frontline Covid-19 worker and prisoner advocate Frances Donaldson.

Justice Melinda Richards ordered VicForests on Friday to carry out full surveys of areas for greater gliders and yellow-bellied gliders before logging, and to include buffers around habitats.   Updated at 5.29am GMT    4.57am    Queensland\u2019s Callide coal power station taken offline by equipment failures A major Queensland coal power station connected to the national grid has been taken offline by equipment failures, sparking fresh concerns about blackouts in the sunshine state, AAP reports. State-owned electricity generator CS Energy says all four units at the Callide power station, near Biloela, were offline at one point on Friday morning. One unit has been out of action since a catastrophic explosion in May 2021, then another turbine unit was taken offline as a precaution after a cooling tower partially collapsed on Monday. CS Energy says a third turbine unit was tripped out during routine testing on Tuesday, while the mining and energy union says the fourth unit was tripped on Friday morning. The company has confirmed the third unit had automatically tripped after high temperature gas release during a scheduled test. \u201cIn addition to the unit\u2019s automated control system response, the onsite team acted quickly to make the unit safe,\u201d a CS Energy statement on Friday said. \u201cNo one was injured and an investigation into the incident is being completed.\u201d  Updated at 5.43am GMT    4.47am    South Australia to ban almost all single-use plastics over next three years  The South Australian government has outlined an ambitious plan to ban more single-use plastics, with almost everything to go over the next three years, AAP has reported. The government will draft legislation to cover a range of items, with its first targets including single-use plastic plates and bowls to be outlawed by September next year. Plastic coffee cups and lids, produce bags and single-use food containers will get the chop in the following year, along with a host of other items. The final wave will ban plastic fruit stickers, soy and fish sauce containers, straws and cutlery attached to pre-packaged food from September 2025. \u201cWith dire predictions that our oceans will contain more plastic than fish by 2050, time\u2019s up for single-use plastic,\u201d the environment minister, Susan Close, said. \u201cSingle-use plastics are often used for moments but they last a lifetime in our environment. \u201cMoving away from single-use items has been welcomed by South Australians, and our community consultation has left no doubt the public expects more action on more items.\u201d  Updated at 5.28am GMT    4.37am    Native fish at risk in polluted flood waters of Murray River Conservationists are working to save unique fish at risk of dying as muddy waters filter into the Murray River, AAP has reported. Murray cod and crayfish are suffocating and jumping out of the river gasping for clean air in a phenomenon known as hypoxic blackwater, where oxygen levels drop due to bacteria sucking oxygen from polluted flood waters. Major flooding is still occurring at Echuca-Moama and other Victorian-NSW border towns after the Murray River peaked at record levels in October. Recreational fishing charity OzFish has deployed an emergency team to rescue the fish in partnership with state fishing regulators and the Murray-Darling Basin Authority. The OzFish founder and chief executive, Craig Copeland, said groups had rescued 250 freshwater crayfish at Barham this week and been deployed at Nyah and Swan Hill. \u201cCoordinating these collaborative rescue efforts is vitally important and we are proud to be playing a part alongside so many like-minded and committed individuals and their organisations,\u201d he said in a statement on Friday. \u201cGiven the situation affecting native fish we have a further Fish Emergency Recovery Team deploying from today to relocate as many native fish, including Murray cod, to safe water.\u201d  Updated at 5.41am GMT    4.20am    Businesses that can throw millions at a campaign should be paying workers better, PM says Anthony Albanese has taken aim at business groups threatening a multimillion-dollar advertising campaign against industrial relations changes, saying they should spend the money on paying workers better. The Australian Resources and \u00adEnergy Employer Association fired a warning shot against the government over its plans for pay deals across multiple workplaces. This from Daniel Hurst and Paul Karp:   Updated at 4.34am GMT    4.09am    Labor takes step towards new religious discrimination laws The Labor government has asked the Australian Law Reform Commission to review anti-discrimination laws as a step towards improving protections for LGBTQ+ students (and staff) at religious schools. The terms of reference for the review, which is due back at the end of April, include meeting Labor\u2019s commitments that religious schools:  Must not discriminate against a student on the basis of sexual orientation, gender identity, marital or relationship status or pregnancy. Must not discriminate against a member of staff on the basis of sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, marital or relationship status or pregnancy. Can continue to build a community of faith by giving preference, in good faith, to persons of the same religion as the educational institution in the selection of staff.  So protections for students, some protections for staff while balancing religious organisations\u2019 desire to run their schools in line with their doctrines. It\u2019s going to be a tough ask. Justice Stephen Rothman of the NSW supreme court has been agreed to head up the review. Rothman is a former president of the Great Synagogue and made headlines when he announced he would be voting in favour of the marriage equality plebiscite, which he said he viewed as a civil matter, and not something which would impact religious beliefs. But don\u2019t expect legislation any time soon. The review isn\u2019t due to return until April and it will take some time before the government responds. Still, it is a step.

Updated at 4.07am GMT    3.52am    Major gas line bursts, cutting off supply to Bathurst, Lithgow and Oberon A major gas line under the Macquarie River has burst due to flooding, according to the NSW Rural Fire Service. As a result, gas supply to towns west of the Blue Mountains, including Bathurst, Lithgow and Oberon, has been cut off. The fire service is currently going from house to house to shut gas taps as a safety measure.   Updated at 3.55am GMT    3.44am    Ship with Covid passengers to dock in Tasmania A cruise ship carrying passengers with Covid-19 is set to arrive in Tasmania following a disruption brought on by extreme weather across eastern states, AAP has reported. About 2,000 passengers aboard Carnival Australia vessel Coral Princess will call into the port of Burnie on Saturday after an outbreak of the virus. A spokesman said a \u201csmall number\u201d of guests have been impacted but could not confirm the exact number. The company said in a statement on Friday:  As a result of continued and proactive testing, the Covid-19 situation onboard Coral Princess has improved considerably in recent days with a significant number of guests being released from isolation after returning a negative Rapid Antigen Test.  The company added that all cases have been asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic and that anyone who plans to go ashore must undertake a Rapid Antigen Test 24 hours prior to disembarking. Saturday will mark the first major cruise ship to visit Burnie in nearly three years after the pandemic shut down borders in 2020.   Updated at 4.09am GMT    3.33am    And the NSW health announcement on Japanese encephalitis \u2026 NSW has widened access to free Japanese encephalitis (JE) vaccine to a broader group of people from today, Friday 4 November. JE vaccine is now recommended for people aged two months or older who live or routinely work in 39 Local Government Areas with identified JE risk in the west of NSW who:  Spend significant time outdoors (four hours per day), for unavoidable work, recreation, education, or other essential activities, OR Are living in temporary or flood damaged accommodation (e.g. camps, tents, dwellings exposed to the external environment) that place them at increased risk of exposure to mosquitoes, OR Are engaged in the prolonged outdoor recovery efforts (clean up) of stagnant waters following floods  The Executive Director of Health Protection NSW, Dr Jeremy McAnulty, said the key to protecting yourself from JE and other mosquito borne infections is avoiding mosquito bites. For those people who will be exposed to mosquito bites in affected areas, vaccination also helps protect against JE infection. Dr McAnulty emphasised that supply of vaccine continues to be constrained in Australia, but that people most at risk should get vaccinated with the supply available in NSW:  I encourage those people at highest risk because they spend a lot of time outdoors in affected areas to take advantage of the free access to the vaccine as soon as possible, particularly as it can take two weeks or more following vaccination to develop a protective immune response to the virus.  NSW Health has placed orders for additional vaccines that are expected to arrive in the first part of 2023.  Updated at 3.36am GMT    3.21am    Victoria and NSW to expand access to Japanese encephalitis vaccine The NSW and the Victorian governments have just announced they will expand access to the Japanese encephalitis virus vaccine. I\u2019ll bring you the Vic announcement first. From the Health Dept: While there are currently no confirmed cases of JEV in Victoria, flooding and heavy rainfall across the state can mean greater risk of infections spread by mosquitoes this season. Vaccination against JEV is now available for anyone aged two months or older who:  lives, or routinely works, in a high-risk area and spends significant time outdoors (four hours per day), for unavoidable work, recreational, educational or other essential activities, or is living in temporary or flood-damaged accommodation that places them at an increased risk of exposure to mosquitoes, or is engaged in the prolonged clean-up of stagnant waters following floods.  Victoria\u2019s Deputy Chief Health Officer Associate Professor Deborah Friedman said:  While getting vaccinated is important, everyone should focus on preventing being bitten by mosquitoes. This includes wearing long, loose-fitting, light-coloured clothing, using insect repellents, clearing stagnant water around your home, and avoiding areas with lots of mosquitoes, especially at dusk and dawn. We know mosquitoes don\u2019t breed in initial flood waters, but that the risk increases as these waters recede and leave behind pools of stagnant water.  People living in areas experiencing mosquito activity should undertake these protective measures now and over the coming months to protect themselves against not just JEV, but other mosquito-borne diseases for which no vaccine is available \u2013 including Ross River virus, Barmah Forest virus and Murray Valley encephalitis.  Updated at 3.36am GMT    3.10am   Alan Joyce to get millions in bonuses and stay on as Qantas chief until at least end 2023  Qantas boss, Alan Joyce, will pocket millions in bonuses despite customer fury over service failures, lost bags, cancelled flights and union anger over staff pay. Joyce will also stay on as chief executive officer until at least the end of next year, Qantas chair, Richard Goyder, confirmed at the airline\u2019s annual general meeting today. Joyce\u2019s take-home pay last financial year was $2.27m, up from $1.98m the year before. On top of that base salary, shareholders voted overwhelmingly in favour of awarding him bonus performance rights worth about $4m. They also voted in favour of him receiving long-term rights amounting to about $5m. He has deferred converting those rights and vesting them into shares for now. Other short-term bonuses, deferred during the pandemic, could also be added depending on performance.  Goyder took the opportunity at the AGM to slam the federal government\u2019s planned industrial relations changes, saying multi-employer bargaining would \u201ceffectively lead to centralised wage setting\u201d, which would in turn affect productivity. The Transport Workers\u2019 Union called the AGM a \u201cfarce and a wasted opportunity\u201d, because the board would have delivered Joyce a bonus in cash even if shareholders voted against the bonus shares. TWU national secretary, Michael Kaine, said:  It was literally impossible for Joyce not to walk away multi-millions richer. Shareholders should have been able to cast a genuine vote on the reinstatement of illegally sacked workers, costly legal battles, and a post-Joyce future for the tarnished airline.  Goyder also warned that a new Covid wave could see another spike in sick leave, although he said there was more resilience in the system now to cope. Ahead of the meeting, Qantas issued a statement saying its performance had improved after \u201chitting a low point\u201d in July. Flight cancellations are happening in 2.2% of flights, which is below pre-Covid levels, the airline said. In June, 7.5% of flights were cancelled. \u201cMishandled\u201d bags are at six in 1,000 passengers, which is \u201calmost\u201d back to pre-Covid levels. Twice that many were mishandled in April.  Updated at 4.22am GMT    3.00am    ATO official sent DHS \u2018cease and desist\u2019 request over robodebt, inquiry hears A tax office official sent a \u201ccease and desist\u201d request to the Department of Human Services at the initial height of controversy over the robodebt scheme in 2017, a royal commission has been told. But the inquiry was told on Friday that emails showed the department essentially refused the demand by citing the Coalition government\u2019s support for its debt recovery activities, which turned out to be unlawful. The ATO\u2019s involvement in the scheme was crucial because it held the annual income data that was shared with Centrelink staff in order to raise debt through the unlawful \u201cincome averaging\u201d method. Emails aired at the commission on Friday showed that as media attention about the scheme increased during 2017, ATO officials began having concerns about how the data was being used. That led to an email in July 2017 from a tax official asking that DHS \u201ccease and desist\u201d from using the data while it sought assurances that it was being used in accordance with the law. The documents do not indicate which aspect of the law the official was concerned about. The inquiry heard that within a couple of hours, a DHS official responded suggesting a working group meeting to discuss the \u201ctechnical aspects\u201d of the program. But the DHS official also noted that \u201cthere are currently a range of measures the government has asked us to deliver which rely on data matching capabilities\u201d. It added that \u201cthis work needs to continue\u201d. Senior counsel assisting, Justin Greggery, said the emails indicated that DHS had invoked the government in order to apply \u201cpolitical weight\u201d and push back against the request. Under questioning, Jeremy Hirschhorn, second commissioner at the Australian Taxation Office, noted the email reflected the concerns of one official at the ATO. \u201cI don\u2019t know which law he might be referring to,\u201d Hirschhorn said, noting the ATO official was not a lawyer. Hirschhorn was not involved in the discussions around robodebt but has been called to give evidence on behalf of the ATO to explain its understanding of the situation at the time. The nature of the data meant the ATO was under no obligation to provide the data being used under the robodebt scheme, and thus was doing so voluntarily, the inquiry has been told. However, at the time the \u201ccease and desist\u201d was sent, a significant amount of tax office data had already been provided to DHS. The inquiry continues.  Updated at 3.33am GMT    2.47am    That\u2019s me signing off for the day. The fabulous Amy Remeikis will be back on the blog next week with parliament sitting, so I won\u2019t see you back here for a little while. As for the rest of the afternoon, the wonderful Cait Kelly is taking over!     2.39am   Greens call for electricity bill freeze, paid for by windfall tax on coal, oil and gas companies  The Greens are calling on the government to freeze electricity bills for the next two years, proposing a windfall super profits tax on coal, oil and gas companies to pay for the move. Parliamentary Budget Office costings commissioned by the Greens show a temporary windfall tax would raise close to $50bn over the next two years, with about half going to cover the cost of the bill freeze. The Greens leader, Adam Bandt, said that energy corporations were \u201cwartime profiteers\u201d and the government needed to make them pay more tax rather than give them concessions. \u201cCoal and gas corporations are driving up power bills and profiteering from people\u2019s pain,\u201d Bandt said. \u201cWith these greedy power companies paying the difference on electricity bills, prices are frozen for households but won\u2019t hold back investment in the clean energy generation we urgently need to get prices down.\u201d Under the proposal, retail electricity bills would be frozen for households for two years at the same rates as prior to the invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, with any price difference covered by the windfall profit tax. The median household across the country would save a forecast $776, the PBO analysis shows. The proposal would increase the budget balance by around $25bn, with an increase in revenue of around $49.6 billion, and the cost of freezing electricity bills at $24 billion. The PBO modelled the cost of temporarily paying retailers the total difference between retail prices per kilowatt-hour as of 24 February 2022 and the prevailing increased retail price for households. It noted there was \u201csignificant uncertainty\u201d in modelling the proposal because of a range of factors.  Updated at 2.45am GMT    2.29am    WA farewells emergency Covid-19 powers Western Australia\u2019s Covid-19 state of emergency has come to an end as the country braces for a new wave of infections. WA\u2019s emergency powers expired overnight after more than two and a half years. They had been used by the McGowan government to take drastic measures earlier in the pandemic, including declaring border closures. In a surprise move, the government has opted not to immediately enact replacement powers rushed through the Labor-controlled parliament last month. The temporary Covid-19 declarations can be used to enforce mask-wearing and isolation requirements but do not allow for interstate travel bans. Premier Mark McGowan has said the measures will only be activated when necessary but could be triggered by a spike in infections or the emergence of new variants. He told reporters this week:  It\u2019s there and available should we require it.  Public hospitals will individually manage mask and visitor restrictions while still requiring staff and visitors to stay away when acutely unwell. \u2013 from AAP  Updated at 2.30am GMT    2.20am   ACT records one Covid death and 37 people in hospital  There were 910 new cases in the weekly reporting period, and one person is in intensive care.      2.10am    Victorian government has \u2018questions to answer\u2019 on reported anti-corruption probe: opposition Victoria\u2019s opposition leader, Matthew Guy, says the Andrews government has \u201cquestions to answer\u201d around a reported anti-corruption probe. The Herald Sun on Friday reported that the state\u2019s anti-corruption watchdog has been investigating a $1.2m contract awarded to a training organisation controlled by the Health Workers\u2019 Union ahead of the 2018 election. It reported that former employees of the then health minister, Jill Hennessy, and the premier, Daniel Andrews, were among government staff interviewed. The report in the Herald Sun came after the state\u2019s supreme court granted the Independent Broad-based Anti-corruption Commission an interim injunction order against Nine Newspapers to prevent the publication reporting on details of a \u201cproposed report\u201d. Guy said the report of another corruption probe was \u201cextraordinary\u201d:  This is the fourth time this government is involved in an anti-corruption commission investigation. It says a lot about why, I believe, the anti-corruption commission should have its powers increased and its financial support increased as well.  The Victorian opposition has promised to boost Ibac\u2019s funding by $10m per year and give it broader powers for public hearings if it wins this month\u2019s state election. A joint inquiry by Ibac and the Victorian ombudsman, released earlier this year, uncovered extensive misconduct by Labor MPs, including widespread misuse of public resources, nepotism, signatures being forged and attempts to interfere with government grants.Two more Ibac inquiries in which the premier has reportedly given evidence continue. They involve land deals in the city of Casey and state\u2019s fire services reform.  Updated at 2.19am GMT    2.06am    Large dams may threaten survival of platypus populations, research finds Floods continue to put dams on the agenda. At that recent press conference in Forbes, NSW premier Dominic Perrottet was asked about the raising of the Warragamba Dam and said once the business case was complete, he would be working closely with the federal government on a joint funding arrangement. However, my colleague Lisa Cox has this concerning report out today about the effect that major dams have on the platypus:  Major dams have disrupted gene flow between platypus populations, making them more vulnerable to threats, according to new research. Scientists from the University of New South Wales examined the genetic makeup of platypuses in free-flowing and dammed rivers in that state. Their results, published in Communications Biology, found there was greater genetic differentiation between platypus populations located above and below dams compared to populations in free-flowing rivers.    Updated at 2.13am GMT    1.55am    114 flood rescues in NSW this week: SES      1.44am    RBA provides an inflation forecasting \u2018mea culpa\u2019 The RBA\u2019s quarterly statement holds lots of data that is worth a good comb through, such as its view that \u201cthe prospects of a significant slowing in the global economy have intensified over the past three months\u201d with all those rate rises, Europe\u2019s \u201cenergy crisis\u201d and \u201cvarious headwinds affecting China\u2019s recovery\u201d. But one of the most interesting parts comes at the end, with a special box on (drum roll, maestro): \u201cWhat Explains Recent Inflation Forecast Errors?\u201d Note, there is no \u201cour\u201d in the headline, but I suppose that\u2019s fair. As John Hawkins, a former senior official within both the RBA and Treasury and now a lecturer at the University of Canberra, tells us, pretty much every forecaster misfired. Anyway, the RBA says:  As one of the largest economic shocks in a century, the inflationary effects of the pandemic-driven imbalance between supply and demand for goods both globally and domestically played an important role in the forecast miss. Other unforecastable shocks \u2013 such as the effects of Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine and the Australian east-coast floods \u2013 also contributed.  To limit the risk of future errors, the bank has made \u201cupward adjustments [in its models] based on liaison, surveys and international experience\u201d. Still, the RBA admits not all the errors were eliminated, implying that there are limits to what models can predict. (It\u2019s a bit like \u201chind-casting\u201d used to test climate models. You get more confident about your model if it accurately mimics what has been observed in the past.) The mea culpa might be a bit of pre-emptive explaining on the part of the RBA, which is in the midst of its first formal review in decades. Hawkins, though, welcomed the RBA\u2019s \u201cself-criticism\u201d, saying it showed it was \u201ckeen to learn from past mistakes\u201d, even if no other forecasts saw how much inflation would accelerate.

Andrews told Sky News:  It seems as if the Labor government was quite happy for there to be a lot of speculation about the monitoring of these women, when in reality there seems to be little to nothing.  We already brought you the home affairs minister, Clare O\u2019Neil\u2019s comments this morning about the repatriated families of Islamic State fighters. O\u2019Neil said: O\u2019Neil\u2019s response to whether the families repatriated from Syria are being monitored:  The same considerations applied in 2019 when the Coalition did the same thing, as has done the governments of Canada, the US, Denmark, the Netherlands and many other countries. They are difficult problems, we handle them calmly and methodically.      1.20am    NSW/Queensland border rivers reach major peak       1.06am    RBA\u2019s core inflation measure nudged higher Among the slew of figures in the 85-page RBA quarterly statement is the uplift in the central bank\u2019s forecast for underlying inflation. The awkwardly named \u201ctrimmed mean\u201d inflation rate that stripped out the more volatile price movements will peak at 6.5% at the end of 2022, up from a 6% peak expected in the RBA\u2019s August assessment. That change was not unexpected since the trimmed mean was already at a record 6.1% in the September quarter. Of note, however, is that the RBA predicts this inflation measure will only slow to 3.25% by December 2024, the end of the forecast period. That\u2019s outside the 2%-3% target band the RBA aims to have for inflation, implying it won\u2019t be relaxing its hawkish stance on interest rates any time soon. That\u2019s in contrast to some banks, such as CBA, that expect the RBA to be cutting its cash rate before the end of 2023.  Updated at 1.07am GMT    12.58am   Impact of recent NSW flood event eclipses February/March event  Steph Cooke gives a bit more detail about those primary producer grants Perrottet mentioned.  These are grants of up to $25,000 available to primary producers in the 66 local government areas.  She says the number of local government areas affected by recent flooding has now reached 66, which overtakes the 60 affected by the event earlier in the year.  We have extended overnight the number of local government areas covered by natural disaster declaration by an additional 11, taking the total number covered by this event to 66. To give some context, in our February event, they were just 60 local government areas impacted so this event now eclipses what we have seen earlier this year. What I have said in recent weeks is that we\u2019re now seeing flood upon flood upon flood. The layering of one flood on another.  Cooke vows to continue to offer more financial aid support in partnership with the federal government.  We know that there is a lot of work to be done in terms of restoration and public infrastructure. We will continue to support councils, continue to work with primary producers and communities and importantly, we will continue to work with the federal government to unlock more layers of support as the need becomes apparent to us.   Updated at 1.05am GMT    12.52am    \u2018Nine river systems in major flooding\u2019: NSW emergency services minister Steph Cooke, says record breaking floods expected in Forbes are part of extensive flooding across inland NSW. She says even as the state\u2019s weather conditions ease, the risk of flood does not.  We do have over 100 emergency warnings in place today, right across NSW.  Nine river systems are in major flooding at present. We\u2019ve not only got the real risk here in Forbes, in the Lachlan Valley, but major flooding in the Murray, Murrumbidgee and the river systems out west like the Barwon, the Darling, the Namoi, etc.      12.45am    NSW and federal government offers rural assistance grants of up to $25,000 for flooded communities The NSW premier, Dominic Perrottet, has stepped up to speak in Forbes, the central west town expecting its worst flood in 70 years. Together with the NSW emergency services minister, Steph Cooke, it\u2019s their second visit in recent weeks as the town has seen continuous inundation. Perrottet says he will be travelling to Wagga Wagga later today which is also experiencing major flooding.  I want to reiterate to everybody to continue to follow the instructions of the emergency services, whether that is in Forbes or anywhere else across our state. You wouldn\u2019t drive into a bushfire, do not drive through flood waters. We have seen too many lives lost because people do not follow that simple rule.  Perrottet announces rural assistance grants of up to $25,000 will be offered together with the commonwealth government, and that 50 ADF personnel have been deployed to provide support in Forbes.

He conceded the airline hadn\u2019t been living up to expectations. He said:  There were too many delayed flights, long call centre wait times, and too many mishandled bags. There were good reasons why this happened. But they weren\u2019t good enough.  Joyce said service levels were at, or near pre-Covid levels now but warned that there could be another spike in sick leave if another Covid wave hits.  Updated at 12.48am GMT    12.33am   RBA says inflation will peak at 8%  The Reserve Bank expects inflation to peak at 8% in the December quarter, propelled by rising energy costs, while wage increases are only forecast to reach a top rate of 4% by June 2024. In its latest quarterly statement on monetary policy, released on Tuesday, the central bank confirmed the annual consumer price index would accelerate from the 7.3% recorded for the September quarter. If achieved, 8% would be the highest since the first three months of 1990 when it was 8.7%. More to follow.  Updated at 12.35am GMT    12.26am   Andrews courts votes of Victorian dog owners with $13m commitment for six new parks  The Victorian premier, Daniel Andrews, has announced $13.4m to build six new dog parks in Melbourne and upgrades for an additional 22 if re-elected later this month. Speaking at Pawfield Park in Caulfield, Andrews also pledged $2m to support low-cost vet clinics and $5m for the animal welfare fund in honour of Oscar, the dog behind the state\u2019s laws banning puppy farms, who recently died. He told reporters pet ownership is up by 8% since Covid:  Sixty-nine per cent of families have got a pet. There\u2019s never been a more important time to invest in new dog parks, upgraded dog parks, to support the amazing work that so many community volunteers do.  The new parks will be located in Armstrong Creek, Wollert, Sydenham, Mount Waverley, Wantirna and Endeavour Hills. Pawfield Park will be upgraded. Caulfield is one of the state\u2019s most marginal seats and is currently held by Liberal MP David Southwick. An electoral redistribution sees it become a Labor seat held by a razor-thin 0.2% margin. And yes, for those wondering, there\u2019s a lot of pics of the premier with dogs.  We\u2019ve also had our first heckler of the campaign. A man walking a dog has shouted, \u201cyou\u2019re a disgrace\u201d at the premier then walked away.  Updated at 1.26am GMT    12.21am   Government prepared to take action if energy suppliers do not cooperate: Albanese  The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, is speaking on the Sunshine Coast in Queensland on the topic of surging energy prices:  We know that people and businesses need for some of this pressure to be taken off and are working through the issues. There will be discussion again next week at our cabinet and that is what the treasurer [Jim Chalmers] is doing, working with our energy minister, Chris Bowen, the resources minister, Madeleine King, minister for industry and manufacturing, [Ed Husic], all working to make sure we get an appropriate outcome. We want this to be cooperative. But that should not be read as we are not prepared to take action if the energy suppliers are not prepared to cooperate here. We know that there has been substantial increases in profits at the same time as families and businesses are hurting from the increased charges and that is why we want to work for a solution as a matter of priority.   Updated at 12.34am GMT    12.18am    Australian Cyber Security Centre\u2019s threat report released We mentioned the Australian Cyber Security Centre\u2019s annual threat report quite a bit this morning on the blog, with responses from the cybersecurity minister, Clare O\u2019Neil, and the defence minister, Richard Marles. If you want to read that report for yourself, you can find it here:      12.10am    RBA clues on inflation and wages coming up At 11.30am AEDT, we\u2019ll get the RBA\u2019s latest quarterly statement on monetary policy. It\u2019s likely we\u2019ll have the usual wording about the central bank being primed to raise its key interest rate as high and as long as possible to slay that inflation dragon*. The focus, though, will likely be the confirmation that the RBA expects annual inflation to peak at 8% (or thereabouts) in the December quarter. That would be the highest since the consumer price index was running at 8.7% in the March quarter of 1990. (No idea who was \u201ctop of the pops\u201d.) Also of interest (pun!) will be how high the central bank expects wages to rise and when, finally, they might overhaul the impact of inflation. (We get the September quarter wage price index on 16 November, curiously \u2013 or annoyingly \u2013 three weeks after the CPI landed.) Watch out for the bank\u2019s updated view on how high electricity and gas prices are rising, and what that might mean for inflation. (There\u2019s reason not to panic, as we showed here:)  As for what the RBA might do about interest rate rises to come, here\u2019s what the markets were telling us yesterday:  *As for dragons being slain, the concept rankles those in cultures where dragons are generally beneficent creatures, such as in China. As it happens, prices generally seem to be on the skids, along with the country\u2019s gargantuan property market, so they might welcome an inflation dragon.  Updated at 12.17am GMT    12.04am   Thousands more seniors to get access to healthcare card  Tens of thousands more seniors will be able to access to the commonwealth seniors health card from today, after last week\u2019s budget increased the income threshold for the card. The Albanese government committed almost $70m in funding to increase the income threshold from $57,761 to $90,000 for singles and from $92,416 to $144,000 for couples. The social services minister, Amanda Rishworth, said the measure will help seniors amid the cost-of-living crisis to access to medicines and see their GP.   Updated at 12.08am GMT    11.46pm   Water running into Forbes CBD with homes to be inundated soon  Residents of the central west NSW town of Forbes are bracing for their worst flood in seventy years, as the Lachlan River is predicted to reach the 10.8 metres of the 1952 floods. The Forbes mayor, Phyllis Miller, told ABC News the community is doing the best it can to prepare for the rising floodwaters.  Unfortunately there is not many of us that were around in 1952, so we are doing the very best we can with the information that we have got at hand. As a community, we are all pulling together and helping one another. This morning we had a beautiful sunrise but we also had water starting to run into our CBD. Our iron bridge is sitting at 10.31 metres and of course the prediction is 10.8 metres. That rose 0.6 metres over a two-hour period. That water will start to come in right through today and certainly will go into the business district as well as homes. Farmers have lost enormous amounts of crops. They are doing a tough, really tough.   Updated at 11.55pm GMT    11.29pm    Victorian school ordered to evacuate over levee fears A school in northern Victoria has been told to evacuate with concerns over the integrity of a nearby flood levee. Emergency Victoria strongly advises people in and near the Koondrook primary school to evacuate immediately. With the surging Murray River at peak flow as it passes the small township, the water level is reaching the maximum levee height and there are concerns a breach could happen. There are currently more than 50 flood hazard warnings active across Victoria while some 400 roads remain closed. Emergency service volunteers are also undertaking preventative sandbagging and doorknocking on the Murray at Albury, where inflows from the Kiewa River combined with increased outflows from Hume Dam to cause moderate flooding. Conditions have eased in Rochester, where at least 900 people have been displaced and many more are assessing damage to homes after sandbagging efforts were overwhelmed by flood waters in October. - from AAP  Updated at 11.33pm GMT    11.21pm   Victoria records 24 Covid deaths and 231 people in hospital  There were 10,226 new cases in the last reporting period, and seven people are in intensive care.      11.12pm   NSW records 24 Covid deaths and 809 people in hospital  There were 12,450 new cases in the weekly reporting period, and 17 people are in intensive care.      11.01pm    Victorian opposition promises $160m for bus expansion On day three of Victoria\u2019s election campaign, the opposition leader, Matthew Guy, is in Sunbury in Melbourne\u2019s north-west. The opposition has pledged that, if elected, a Coalition government would deliver $160m across four years to expand bus services across the state. Sunbury is a safe Labor seat, but there are fears the party could suffer significant swings against it in this area, due to growing frustration that infrastructure has not kept up with the region\u2019s ballooning population.  Guy said Melbourne and regional Victorian hubs needed more bus networks:  Rewarding hard working families is part of my agenda and making sure there is a greater number of public transport options is a key part of that.  It\u2019s so important we get bus services right. It\u2019s so important that they compliment our large rail and tram network.  The opposition\u2019s bus package would include 45 new routes and a further 20 under review. The opposition\u2019s transport spokesperson Danny O\u2019Brien said there were too many public transport deserts in Victoria.   Updated at 11.55pm GMT    10.54pm    Police continue search for man swept away in flood waters as companion\u2019s body discovered Emergency services have issued 22 emergency warnings across NSW including for Wagga Wagga, Gunnedah, Moama and Forbes, which awaits the worst flooding in the central west NSW town in 70 years. Meanwhile, police divers are continuing to search for the body of a man swept out of a ute tray and into a flooded river in the Southern Tablelands. The man was one of two flung from the tray on Monday night when the ute was driven across a causeway. Police divers found the other man\u2019s body on Thursday afternoon. - from AAP  Updated at 11.00pm GMT    10.41pm    Police pressure remains high at key mining event The International Mining and Resources Conference is wrapping up its third and final day in Sydney on Friday, with a \u201cfocus on workplace culture in the mining and extraction industry\u201d. The security has been pretty intense with organisers telling the 7,500 or so delegates that \u201cappropriate security measures\u201d are in place to ensure \u201cattendance is safe and secure\u201d. The organisers warned that \u201cvarious groups are planning protests\u201d. Well, so far, the biggest protest has been this one this morning:  And there\u2019s a bit more of the police presence here. (Inside, there are layers of delegate check, roaming police, including plainclothes officers.)  Security seemed particularly twitchy. Yesterday afternoon, staff were busy making phone calls to determine if protesters had somehow infiltrated the W Hotel construction site to hold some sort of stunt. (Unfurl a flag, perhaps ... that would have been viewed by almost nobody ...) Anyway, organisers were satisfied with the results so far to confirm the event will return to Sydney from 31 October to 2 November next year. \u201cMining has never been more essential,\u201d Anita Richards, Imarc\u2019s managing director said. \u201cA decarbonised global economy depends on it, and as a truly global event, Imarc is all about bringing together industry, government, and community leaders from all over the world to lead the conversations the world needs for a clean energy future.\u201d Wonder if \u201ccommunity leaders\u201d will include environmental groups next time. Odds don\u2019t look great.  Updated at 11.38pm GMT    10.28pm    Rennie underwhelmed by Anzac team talk Plans for a combined Wallabies-All Blacks \u201csuperteam\u201d to tackle the British &amp; Irish Lions appear to have left Australia coach, Dave Rennie, somewhat underwhelmed. Following reports the NZRU and Rugby Australia have been discussing the possibility of the best players in both countries teaming up for a one-off spectacular against the Lions on the 2025 tour, Rennie admitted he hadn\u2019t heard anything about the prospect. And when asked whether that might be a team he\u2019d be interested in coaching, given he is a New Zealander who\u2019s overseen the Wallabies, he offered a half-smile and noted:  Jeez, don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll be coaching Australia then ... It\u2019s above my pay grade. Probably more important is sorting out a domestic competition between the two countries as opposed to picking a team that represents both countries, so I\u2019d be interested to see if there\u2019s any validity in that.  The players were caught by surprise too with Wallabies prop Matt Gibbon enthusing \u201cit would be pretty cool\u201d. Veteran Bernard Foley couldn\u2019t envisage playing in three years time, never mind in an \u2018Anzac XV\u2019.  But could the great trans-Tasman rivals put their Bledisloe rivalry behind them and join forces in perfect harmony? Foley said:  I\u2019m sure they could. You see the Lions guys able to do it. Australians and New Zealanders \u2013 as much as we are competitors, if there was the opportunity I\u2019m sure the guys would get along fine.  - from AAP  Updated at 10.32pm GMT    10.12pm    Politics to become completely devoid of anyone \u2018who has ever done anything interesting\u2019 Albanese predicts Albanese said \u201cmuch of the debate in politics generally has got far worse\u201d during his quarter of a century in parliament, with social media among the trends driving the polarisation:  I can look, at any time, at a \u00adsocial media feed of mine and find something [in response] that is completely over the top.  Albanese said this has a damaging effect on politics itself, with young people likely to be turned off entering politics in the first place.  It undermines people\u2019s participation in the process. I think for young people considering going into politics, they\u2019ve got to worry about what will be said about them. They\u2019ve also got to worry about what\u2019s on their social media feed from 30 years ago. We\u2019re going to end up with no one who has ever done anything interesting participating.  Albanese called for greater \u201csophistication\u201d in political dialogue.  Sophistication in political dialogue is an asset. It\u2019s something that we have that differentiates us from the lack of political discourse in Russia, for example.   Updated at 10.16pm GMT    10.08pm   Albanese says Morrison was 'alone' among world leaders in not denouncing Capitol Hill riots  The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, has told the Australian that \u201cfragile\u201d democracy is under threat in a wide ranging interview on foreign policy and national security. Albanese called the hammer attack on US Speaker Nancy Pelosi\u2019s husband, Paul, a \u201chorrifying\u201d symptom of the increased polarisation of political discourse. In this environment, the PM said:  Democrats have to stand up for democracy; we can\u2019t duck these issues.  Albanese criticised Scott Morrison for not denouncing former US president Donald Trump\u2019s inciting the riots on Washington\u2019s Capitol Hill last year on January 6.  Then prime minister Scott Morrison was alone, really, among democratic leaders in not calling it out; in the UK, France, Germany, Canada, it was called out and it should have been. The circumstances in the US, with people almost in paramilitary gear, is a concern. That concern has been expressed, quite rightly, by President [Joe] Biden.   Updated at 10.12pm GMT    10.06pm    Warnings intense rainfall could lead to flash flooding in the Northern Territory      9.48pm    Queensland casinos issued with show cause notices Show cause notices have been issued to the licensees of two Queensland casinos following a determination they are unsuitable to hold licences. The state\u2019s attorney general, Shannon Fentiman, says major failings at The Star Gold Coast and Treasury Brisbane were highlighted in a review conducted by former judge Robert Gotterson.His inquiry was ordered after the NSW gaming regulator found Star Entertainment repeatedly breached the law, misled banks and allowed criminals to operate with impunity and gamble almost without restraint.That probe also heard serious allegations about Star\u2019s conduct in the northern state.Fentiman says the notices issued late on Thursday provided the two entities with the opportunity to show cause as to why disciplinary action should not be taken against them.Their responses are due by 25 November. The attorney general said:  While it is important that we do not pre-empt the outcomes of these show cause notices, new legislation ensures the government has a range of disciplinary options available following that process.  These include increased fines of up to $100m and the appointment of a special manager. - from AAP  Updated at 9.51pm GMT    9.45pm    Taxing gas companies won\u2019t bring down energy prices: Marles If you were watching the blog yesterday you know the industry minister, Ed Husic, accused gas companies of a \u201cglut of greed problem\u201d as Australian households face rising energy bills. The deputy PM, Richard Marles, is asked if he also believes gouging by energy companies is behind the rising prices:  I think there is a way to go and we\u2019re open minded about what steps we can take here. We\u2019re engaged in this right now to try and get an outcome which places downward pressure on gas prices.  The treasurer, Jim Chalmers, spoke on Q+A last night about the problem, saying a windfall tax on coal and gas (recently implemented by the UK) was one of three options he had in front of him to try encourage energy companies to bring prices down. On the idea of a tax, Marles said:  I don\u2019t think that is a plan that is going to place downward pressure on gas prices.   Updated at 10.23pm GMT    9.33pm    Marles denies Australia is competing with China amid countries\u2019 donations to Solomon Islands police Beijing will donate water cannon trucks, vehicles and motorcycles to the Royal Solomon Islands Police Force this morning in a ceremony involving the Chinese ambassador, Li Ming. It comes two days after Australia gave dozens of semi-automatic rifles and 13 vehicles to the country\u2019s police force. ABC Radio asks Richard Marles if Australia is trying to compete China in Solomon Islands:  No ... we\u2019ve just got to focus on our own relationships with Solomon Islands, and indeed with the countries of the Pacific, and I genuinely do believe if we are present and if we are engaged with the countries of the Pacific they do want to work with us \u2013 we are the natural partner of choice, but we have to be there. Ultimately countries in the Pacific are free to have the relations they want to with any country. What we\u2019ve got to focus on is making sure we are deeply engaged in the Pacific.   Updated at 10.23pm GMT    9.25pm    Government wants public more aware of cybersecurity and to take individual responsibility Richard Marles:  There\u2019s also a public cyberhealth campaign we need to be running here which is why we\u2019re releasing this report today. We\u2019re doing interview such as this, to try and get people aware of their own cybersecurity, so that at an individual level people are taking for responsibility for their security.  Will the government launch a formal campaign like it does when it comes to public health issues?  I think there is a public health dimension to this \u2026 The message today is this is a threat which is growing.   Updated at 10.23pm GMT    9.18pm    More investment needed for cybersecurity regulation in private sector: Marles Richard Marles says big fines for corporations who don\u2019t do enough to protect customers\u2019 data is \u201cpart of the answer\u201d when it comes to cybersecurity, but the government is also thinking about further regulatory measures.  I think a lot of this is about making sure the systems are in place across the private sector, across government that we are investing a lot more in this space \u2013 which we are doing.   Updated at 10.22pm GMT    9.11pm   'We see this as a domain of warfare': Marles on cybercrime  Richard Marles says cybercrime represents a threat at multiple levels: on a national scale, as well as for big business and individuals.  There are a number of state actors, but I think what needs to be understood and this is a very grey story. On the one hand, the Signals Directorate is an organisation of defence. That\u2019s in a sense why I\u2019m talking to you today as a defence minister. So we see this as a domain of warfare. On the other end, we are talking about cybercrime. There is an interaction between both. The common denominator in all of this is we have just got to be a lot more vigilant. We\u2019ve got to harden our defences here, for critical infrastructure, for government, but [also] for big businesses like Medibank and Optus.   Updated at 10.22pm GMT    9.03pm    \u2018Cybercrime is now big business\u2019: defence minister We just brought you the cybersecurity minister, Clare O\u2019Neil,\u2019s comments on ABC News following the release of the cybercrime report. Her colleague, the deputy prime minister and defence minister Richard Marles, has been on radio also responding to the increase in malicious cyber activity. What\u2019s his take on what\u2019s driving the increase?  In part we\u2019re living more of our lives online. The pandemic has accelerated that. Cybercrime is now big business. The average impact for small businesses is $40,000 per incident so you can say that there\u2019s a lot of money to be made by cyber criminals. We\u2019re also seeing more state-based actors now that\u2019s in a sense out in the open with the war in Ukraine with Russian malware attacks on Ukraine, but they\u2019re not the only state actors. In the murky grey world that is cyber space, we\u2019re seeing a lot of cross-pollination between state actors and cybercriminals and all of this is giving rise to a much more precarious environment online for all of us.   Updated at 9.16pm GMT    8.54pm    22 emergency flood warnings across NSW      8.47pm    Government has not made a decision whether families of IS fighters could be repatriated to Victoria O\u2019Neil\u2019s response to whether the families repatriated from Syria are being monitored:  You would understand it would be ridiculous for me to talk about the operational ways in which this matter is being handled. I say to viewers, these are difficult things. The same considerations applied in 2019 when the Coalition did the same thing, as has done the governments of Canada, the US, Denmark, the Netherlands and many other countries. They are difficult problems, we handle them calmly and methodically.  She\u2019s asked about when the next group will arrive and if they will be coming to Victoria:  We haven\u2019t made a decision about that. I will be transparent about those details if further decisions are made.   Updated at 8.50pm GMT    8.44pm    Opposition\u2019s \u2018politicking\u2019 on Syrian repatriation \u2018disgraceful\u2019: O\u2019Neil O\u2019Neil, who is also the home affairs minister, is asked about the first group of families of Islamic State fighters repatriated to Australia last weekend who have been settled in western Sydney. ABC News asks the minister about concern by local mayors and residents about the potential security threat posed by these families.  These are sensitive and difficult issues. What I would say is that we are acting on national security advice here. One of the things that hasn\u2019t been properly discussed here is the risk to Australia if we do nothing. The truth is we have got a relatively large group of Australian children who would otherwise be growing up in a camp where a key focus and influence on their life is violent ideology and I don\u2019t think that is good for the country. I understand the concerns. I do want to say, the politicking that is going on from the opposition leader is disgraceful. It is rank hypocrisy because the Liberals did exactly the same thing in 2019, repatriated a group of people from these camps. For some reason they are now saying this is not appropriate to do. People are sick of this kind of politics. National security matters are handled sensitively and delicately and calmly. That is how we have conducted this exercise.   Updated at 8.49pm GMT    8.40pm    \u2018I want the corporate sector to step up and do better\u2019: cybersecurity minister O\u2019Neil says she doesn\u2019t want to get into \u201ca running commentary\u201d about whether Medibank handled the data breach better than Optus.  We have a big task across the business community to lift our standards.  O\u2019Neil is asked if she still believes the Optus breach was a basic hack:  I have made my comments very clear on the public record. Most cyber-attacks aren\u2019t particularly sophisticated. I expect Australian companies to comply with good standards and they owe a duty to Australians whose data they hold to make sure that they do.  O\u2019Neil is asked if she is unhappy with the way Optus have handled this because it has effected millions of people:  It has caused enormous hassle for a lot of people. I am grateful that we don\u2019t have evidence of financial crimes to date. To big businesses around this country, you have got obligations to Australians, especially if you are collecting and keeping personal information about your customers. I want the corporate sector to step up and do better.   Updated at 9.16pm GMT    8.33pm   Cybercrime represents \u2018core national security focus\u2019: cybersecurity minister  O\u2019Neil says that cybercrime forms part of a changing global landscape with the war in the Ukraine and \u201cthreats in our region.\u201d  Cyber is going to be a core part of this.  She says the threat goes beyond fraud and scam texts.  It\u2019s not just about the frauds or the texts you or I might receive, but real issues around the security of our country going forward. This is a core national security focus of our government.   Updated at 8.34pm GMT    8.25pm    Russia and China \u2018specific states\u2019 allowing cybercrime to occur: minister Natasha May now on deck with you! The minister for cybersecurity, Clare O\u2019Neil, has been speaking to ABC News following the release of the Australian Cyber Security Centre\u2019s annual threat report. The report showed a surge in cybercrime as the agency is receiving a report every seven minutes, compared to one every eight minutes the year before. Since that report was completed, O\u2019Neil says the breaches at Optus and Medibank are the \u201ctwo largest cyber-attacks in Australian history that have effectively happened within a month of each other\u201d. O\u2019Neil says that the threat is coming from a number of factors but among those:  We are seeing actors in specific states where effectively governments are allowing criminal conduct to go on.  The report shows \u201cRussia and China are in the mix\u201d, O\u2019Neil confirms. However, she says it is a global threat.  As a country we really need to step up our efforts.   Updated at 9.17pm GMT    8.03pm   Forbes and Wagga on flood watch as waters rise  With more than 100 emergency warnings, regional NSW towns from Forbes to Wagga Wagga are bracing for floodwaters to rise even as blue skies appear. The Murrumbidgee River has also burst its banks, with major floods peaking overnight and evacuation orders for Wagga Wagga in place. Major flooding is also occurring at Gundagai, with river levels now higher than April 1989 floods. Moderate flooding continues at Narrandera, with major flooding possible early next week. It\u2019s a similar scenario for Darlington Point as more water rises overnight. In the wheatbelt town of Forbes in the state\u2019s central west, some 600 people were told to evacuate their homes by 4pm on Thursday as rising waters threaten to cut off properties and strand residents. Cattle farmer Charles Laverty was busy sandbagging his property on the outskirts of Forbes with about one third of his paddocks already underwater. Continued flooding has hit inland communities hard, as farmers struggle to recover from repeated bouts of destruction to crops and livestock. Laverty said:  A lot of [my neighbours] have given up on harvesting those areas, which is very expensive. The losses are going to be devastating for them.  Record flooding is forecast in Forbes on Friday night when the Lachlan River is expected to peak, NSW SES Zone Commander Ben Pickup said. He said peaks would continue through to Saturday morning.   I really encourage the community of Forbes \u2013 please listen to the warning information.  Major flooding on the Lachlan River on Thursday is causing inundations in the town of Nanami. Major flooding continues further downstream at Condobolin, with the river not expected to fall for weeks. \u2013 Australian Associated Press  Updated at 10.49pm GMT    8.03pm    A report by the Committee for Economic Development of Australia today says that women are ending up in prison at increasingly higher rates compared with men, resulting in huge costs to society and the economy. If prison populations and costs continue to increase at the same rate, Australia will be spending at least $1.6bn extra each year on its prison system by 2030, pushing the annual bill to taxpayers above $7bn. Although fewer women are incarcerated than men, the female prison population has grown by more than 60% in the past decade, compared with a 45% increase in the male population. Read our full report here:   Updated at 8.28pm GMT    7.58pm   Welcome  Good morning and welcome to our rolling news coverage. Natasha May will be here shortly to take you through the day\u2019s events, but first let\u2019s catch up with what\u2019s been breaking overnight. Major regional towns in New South Wales including Forbes and Wagga Wagga are on flood alert as rivers peak, even though rain has subsided. Cybercrime is posing an increasing thereat to Australian organisations, businesses and households, according to a new report by the Australian Signals Directorate. It warns that cyberspace is becoming the world\u2019s new \u201cbattleground\u201d and that it is increasingly becoming the \u201cnew domain\u201d for warfare, citing hacking attacks by the Russi and and Chinese states in recent years. Here\u2019s our take on what\u2019s sure to be a big talking point this morning. One you might have from last night is that federal treasurer Jim Chalmers promised on ABC\u2019s Q&amp;A program that the government will unveil its plan to ease pressure on hosuehold energy bills by Christmas. He did not rule out subsidies or changing the way companies are taxed. On with the news.  "

                    "body": "Sophie Ecclestone has attributed England\u2019s dramatic turnaround in the World Cup to the leadership of their captain, Heather Knight, and called on her team to \u201cdo it for Heather\u201d when they face Australia in the final at Christchurch on Sunday. Knight was at the helm five years ago when England won the trophy in dramatic fashion at Lord\u2019s, and more recently has marshalled an incredible turnaround, with her team victorious in five must-win matches on the trot after three initial losses put them on the verge of elimination. At the age of 31, it\u2019s possible that Sunday\u2019s match may be her last chance to lead her side out in a 50-over World Cup final. \u201cTo come back the way we have, Heather\u2019s very proud of this group and what we\u2019ve achieved,\u201d Ecclestone said. \u201cAs a team, we get on so well. We want the best for each other. So when we go out and play cricket, we do it for each other. \u201cWhen we lost three from three, there were a few tears in the changing room. The turning point was a few meetings just to say, we\u2019ve got nothing to lose now, let\u2019s put everything we\u2019re doing at the training ground into a game and go out with no fear, which I think we have done. Hopefully we can go out there on Sunday and do it for Heather.\u201d  Alongside England\u2019s rollercoaster journey, the 22-year-old Ecclestone has experienced something of a personal resurgence during the tournament. The left-arm spinner went wicketless in their opening match against Australia four weeks ago, conceding 77 runs \u2013 her worst-ever figures in ODI cricket. But in the weeks since, she has clambered her way to the top of the tournament wicket-taking charts, with 20 scalps in the bag.  The recently issued ICC bowling rankings revealed that she has risen to the No 1 spot in ODIs for the first time, a distinction that sits alongside her existing crown as the world No 1 T20 bowler. Her return of six for 36 in Thursday\u2019s semi-final against South Africa broke the record for most wickets taken by an Englishwoman at a World Cup, overcoming the previous best by Laura Marsh in the 2009 tournament. \u201cI didn\u2019t have a great day out against the Aussies. To come back the way I did, I\u2019m really proud of myself,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s something I\u2019ve been working hard for, I\u2019ve been trying to get a five-for for a while now. It\u2019s a very proud moment for me and my family.\u201d Adding to her tally during Sunday\u2019s match would be the icing on the cake for a player who was omitted from England\u2019s 2017 World Cup-winning squad, with the then head coach, Mark Robinson, feeling she should focus on her A-level exams. Instead, she had to watch their triumph at Lord\u2019s from the stands along with 24,000 other fans. \u201cIt\u2019s massive for me personally,\u201d she said of this year\u2019s final. \u201cI\u2019ve not won a major trophy yet since I started playing for England, and I\u2019d really love to win one sooner rather than later.\u201d Amazingly, given the dominance of the two sides in international women\u2019s cricket in recent years (no other team has won a 50-over title since 2000), Sunday will be the first time England have faced Australia in a World Cup final since December 1988. On that occasion, at the MCG, Australia smashed England by eight wickets, chasing their 128-run target with ease. One contemporary account described the Australians as \u201cmore athletic and agile in the field, considerably sharper between the wickets \u2026 [they] honed batting and bowling skills to a consistently higher level than the majority of opponents\u201d. Much may have changed in women\u2019s cricket since then, but it is a description which could just as easily apply to Meg Lanning\u2019s 2022 team as it did Lyn Larsen\u2019s in 1988.  Australia\u2019s path to the final could not have been more different from England\u2019s. Lanning and co have gone unbeaten across the tournament, doing nothing to dispel their pre-tournament \u201cfavourites by a country mile\u201d tag; there is a notion in many quarters that the outcome is a foregone conclusion before the coin is even tossed. Ecclestone, naturally, disagrees: \u201cOn our day we can definitely beat the Aussies, and I think we\u2019ve got a great chance to,\u201d she said.  England surrendered the Ashes 12-4 on points in February, but the feeling in the England camp is that their opening World Cup encounter against Australia was a fairer reflection of the way the two sides match up. On that occasion England came within 12 runs of Australia\u2019s mammoth 310-run total, thanks to an unbeaten century from Nat Sciver. Sciver has since had an inconsistent tournament with the bat, but could look to memories of the 2017 final to buoy her before Sunday\u2019s match: her half-century in a low-scoring game at Lord\u2019s was crucial in their nine-run win against India. Australia, meanwhile, have a chance to seal their reputation as one of the all-time great teams by winning the one piece of silverware that has eluded them of late (they last won the tournament in 2013). When her side were knocked out in the 2017 semi-final courtesy of a Harmanpreet Kaur special, Lanning shed tears in the post-match press conference, in an unusual public display of emotion; a win in Sunday\u2019s match would be the ultimate way to heal those scars."
