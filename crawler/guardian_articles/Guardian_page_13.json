                    "body": "  3.03pm   Closing summary  The British manufacturing sector contracted in January for the sixth month in a row as it was hit by inflation, shortages and weak demand, according to the closely followed purchasing managers\u2019 index (PMI). Even worse was the decline in the US manufacturing sector at the start of 2023, although the rate of decline slowed.  Meanwhile, the eurozone\u2019s manufacturing downturn eased further in January and cost pressures faded, according to the PMI. Inflation in the euro area slowed to 8.5% in January, down from 9.2% in December, according to a flash estimate from Eurostat, the EU\u2019s statistical office. House prices in the UK continued to fall in January, sliding for the fifth month in a row, according to Nationwide, pushing the average cost of a home 3.2% below the peak seen last August.  Our other main stories today:          Thank you for reading. We\u2019ll be back tomorrow. Take care \u2013 JK     2.59pm   US manufacturing decline continues in January \u2013 PMI  The US manufacturing sector continued to decline at the start of 2023, according to the latest PMI from S&amp;P Global, although the rate of decline slowed.  The downturn in January was driven by a sharp contraction in new orders, a further drop in output and ongoing efforts to reduce inventories, with subdued sales from domestic and export markets. Factory input costs and output charges rose at increased rates as price pressures strengthened again. Even so, business confidence ticked higher amid hopes of stronger demand in the months ahead, greater supply chain stability and investment in new products.  The S&amp;P Global US Manufacturing Purchasing Managers\u2019 Index posted 46.9 in January, up slightly from 46.2 in December and broadly in line with the earlier released \u2018flash\u2019 estimate of 46.8.      2.52pm   NatWest CEO Alison Rose under pressure from Treasury committee  NatWest CEO Alison Rose has come under pressure after refusing to appear in front of the Treasury Committee next week, where MPs hope to grill the largest banks over whether they are fairly passing on interest rate increases to savers (while simultaneously jacking up the cost of mortgages and loans).  Both the UK CEOs of Barclays and HSBC are set to attend, as is Lloyds Banking Group CEO Charlie Nunn. However, it\u2019s understood NatWest has claimed a scheduling conflict and is instead offering to send the head of its retail bank, David Lindberg.  The refusal to send its top boss has raised eyebrows among MPs on the Treasury Committee, including chair Harriett Baldwin MP. She originally raised the issue during a hearing on Monday regarding diversity and representation in venture capital, saying it would leave the panel with an all-male cast. Baldwin said in a statement on Tuesday: \u201cI am very keen that all the major banks\u2019 top executives appear before our committee.\u201d  NatWest declined to comment.      2.13pm   Darktrace boss hits back at short seller  The chief executive of Darktrace has launched a staunch defence of the embattled cybersecurity company saying it is run with the \u201cgreatest integrity\u201d, refuting the allegations of irregular sales, marketing and accounting practices raised by a US-based hedge fund. Poppy Gustafsson published a 1,200 word defence of the company she co-founded in 2013 aged 30, after its share price collapsed to a record low following the publication of a highly-critical 70-page report by the New York-based hedge fund Quintessential Capital Management (QCM) on Tuesday. \u201cWe embrace the scrutiny of the public markets,\u201d she said. \u201cHowever, it is also important to refute any unfounded inferences about the listed business we are today and push back in the strongest terms on any suggestions that this is a business that is not being run with the greatest integrity.\u201d Gustafsson said that the purpose of publishing the lengthy statement was to \u201cexplain what we\u2019ve done to establish and enforce robust processes in our business\u201d. \u201cI stand by my team and the business I represent,\u201d she added. \u201cOur technology is world-class, created here in the UK by some of the brightest minds. We will continue to address any legitimate questions that may arise.\u201d Darktrace today launched a \u00a375m share buyback of 35m shares in an attempt to bolster investor confidence. Darktrace\u2019s share price has fallen more than a fifth since it was disclosed on Monday that QCM had taken short positions betting against its future performance.      2.10pm    US stocks on Wall Street are expected to open lower ahead of the Fed decision (at 7pm GMT), while European shares are trading slightly higher. The Fed is widely expected to raise interest rates by 25 basis points to 4.75%, following a series of bigger rate hikes last year to bring decades-high inflation down. Markets have pencilled in a further 25bps rate hike in March. Investors will scrutinise Fed chair Jerome Powell\u2019s press conference for any clues on the trajectory of interest rates. The Bank of Canada recently signalled that it would pause after eight rate rises, triggering expectations that the Fed could soon follow suit, and possibly even cut rates towards the end of the year. Recent data suggests that inflation is easing.  Updated at 2.13pm GMT    1.59pm    Paul Ashworth, chief North America economist at Capital Economics, said:  The muted 106,000 increase in the ADP measure of private payroll employment will add to fears that the malaise in activity has spread to the labour market. Nevertheless, while this supports our estimate that non-farm payrolls increased by a below-consensus 150,000 last month, we would still urge caution about relying too much on the ADP measure, particularly in January when firms purge payroll records of employees who may not have worked for months\u2026 On balance, we are sceptical this slowdown is primarily a temporary weather-related issue. Added to the weakness in activity, and the downturn in some forward-looking employment indicators like temporary employment and hours worked, it suggests that the easing in labour market conditions is gathering momentum.   Updated at 2.13pm GMT    1.57pm   US private job growth slows in January  Over in the US, the latest ADP jobs report showed private companies hired just 106,000 new workers in January, far fewer than expected, and down from an upwardly revised 253,000 in December. Most of the hirings were in the hospitality industry, where bars, restaurants, hotels and others added 95,000 jobs.  ADP chief economist Nela Richardson said weather factors were at play and hiring was strong outside the week the firm uses to compile the report, CNBC reported.  In January, we saw the impact of weather-related disruptions on employment during our reference week. Hiring was stronger during other weeks of the month, in line with the strength we saw late last year.       1.26pm    Andy Bruce from Reuters tweeted:      12.41pm    Back to our earlier story about the UK\u2019s annual house price growth slowing to just 1.1%, the lowest rate since mid-2020.      12.27pm     Entain, the owner of gambling brands Ladbrokes and Coral has raised its annual profit forecast after it benefited from customers betting on the men\u2019s football World Cup. The FTSE 100 company said it had seen a record number of customers in the final three months of 2022, an increase of 14% compared with a year earlier. Despite the boost from the tournament, which took place in Qatar in November and December, Entain said this was slightly offset by disruption to some sports fixtures because of wintry weather. Its shares gained 2% in morning trading on Wednesday.

Sky News reported that the cuts would arise from the closure of coke ovens, but that Scunthorpe\u2019s two blast furnaces would continue to operate, citing an industry insider. British Steel and Indian-owned rival Tata Steel have been in talks with the government over \u00a3300m in funding per company that would help them upgrade polluting blast furnaces to cleaner electric arc furnaces. However, the business secretary, Grant Shapps, has told the companies that they must guarantee a certain number of UK jobs until 2033 as part of any agreement. The revelation of a job cut plan could also increase pressure on the government during the negotiations. British Steel was bought out of insolvency by Jingye Group in 2019, after it had collapsed following a takeover by investment firm Greybull Capital. Jingye and Tata are both pushing for government support for the UK plants to match those of other nations such as France and Canada. British Steel was contacted for comment.     12.00pm     One of the most fascinating corporate battles of 2023 so far has been the short seller Hindenburg against billionaire Gautam Adani. Shares in several of Adani\u2019s listed companies comtinued to fall on Wednesday, a week after the first negative report. Hindenburg accused Adani Group of \u201cpulling the largest con in corporate history\u201d \u2013 accusations that Adani has described as a \u201cmalicious combination of selective misinformation and stale, baseless and discredited allegations\u201d. Nevertheless, the report has prompted scrutiny of the group, and a stampede of money out of some of India\u2019s most prominent companies. Reuters on Wednesday put the drop in Adani company valuations at $84bn (\u00a368bn), citing data from Forbes.  Those losses are notable because it means that Adani\u2019s wealth has dropped below that of Indian rival Mukesh Ambani, whose Reliance Industries is another conglomerate that dominates the commanding heights of the economy of the world\u2019s largest democracy. Adani slipped to 15th on the rich list, although with an estimated net worth of $76.8bn he will probably be able to get by. But that is below Ambani who ranks ninth with a net worth of $83.6bn, according to Reuters. The power of the two tycoons in the Indian economy is enormous. The Economist in September wrote:  The duo\u2019s rising influence over Indian business is undisputed. Many observers now talk of the \u201cAA economy\u201d. That is an exaggeration, but the combined revenues of the companies controlled by Messrs Adani and Ambani are equivalent to 4% of India\u2019s GDP.  Reuters reported:  Shares in Adani Enterprises, often described as the incubator of Adani businesses, plunged 30% on Wednesday. Adani Power fell 5%, while Adani Total Gas slumped 10%, down by its daily price limit. Adani Transmission was down 6% and Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone dropped 20%.      11.23am   Eurozone inflation drops further to 8.5%   Euro area annual inflation fell to 8.5% in January 2023, down from 9.2% in December, according to a flash estimate from Eurostat, the EU\u2019s statistical office. Economists and traders around the world are watching for signs that the wave of inflation that is threatening to tip major economies into recession is easing. Lower inflation could mean less need to raise interest rates sharply, which could in turn allow economies to grow more.  Eurozone inflation reached 10.6% in October, so the headline measure has dropped by two percentage points since then. Much of the inflationary pressure has come from energy prices, which surged following Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine a year ago this month. But Eurostat\u2019s early figures show how the pressure is easing \u2013 even if it is still quite high.  Energy is expected to have the highest annual rate in January (17.2%, compared with 25.5% in December), followed by food, alcohol &amp; tobacco (14.1%, compared with 13.8% in December), non-energy industrial goods (6.9%, compared with 6.4% in December) and services (4.2%, compared with 4.4% in December).  An important side note: core inflation \u2013 excluding volatile bits of the index such as energy and food \u2013 was still at a record high of 5.2%. Still, any signs that the pressures on the economy have eased will likely be welcomed by economists.     10.52am   Bestway increases stake in Sainsbury's   Bestway has increased its stake in supermarket Sainsbury\u2019s to 4.47%, as analysts had expected following the surprise announcement of its \u00a3200m stake last week. The company is one of the UK\u2019s largest grocery wholesalers and also the owner of Well Pharmacy stores and the Costcutter and Best-one convenience chains. It paid roughly \u00a3200m for a 3.45% stake in Sainsbury\u2019s, making it the sixth largest investor in Britain\u2019s second largest grocer. The Guardian\u2019s back-of-an-envelope calculations suggest the latest purchase would be worth another \u00a360m. Shares in Sainsbury\u2019s rose sharply on Friday in anticipation of further purchases \u2013 although the filing on Wednesday said that it bought the latest tranche on Friday. 4.5% is an interesting level: another 0.5% to 5% and Bestway would have the ability to force a company to put resolutions to a shareholder vote at an AGM or specially convened shareholder meeting. It has not made any signals that it intends to become an activist, but it is close to being able to exert significant influence (or it could team up with smaller shareholders to do so). From Reuters:  Some analysts have speculated that Bestway wants to use the stake as leverage to get Sainsbury\u2019s to collaborate in wholesale areas or pharmacy retail.  Privately owned Bestway traces its origins back to a corner shop called Kashmir opened in the capital in 1963 by its founder and chair, Sir Anwar Pervez. It is a pretty amazing story, from an Earl\u2019s Court corner shop to becoming a shareholder in one of the UK\u2019s biggest and most prominent companies. You can read more here:      10.28am    It\u2019s a fairly quiet day on financial markets so far. That is probably a result of investors having got into position ahead of the Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell\u2019s comments later. The FTSE 100 is up by 0.1% at 7,778 points. Europe\u2019s blue-chip Stoxx 600 index has gained 0.2%, while Germany\u2019s Dax is up 0.1% and France\u2019s Cac 40 is up less than 0.1%. On the FTSE, it\u2019s the packaging companies leading the way, while Ladbrokes owner Entain is also doing fairly well after raising its profit forecasts after the football World Cup pushed up gamblers\u2019 losses.     10.13am    It might be slightly too early to celebrate a turning point for UK manufacturers.  Glynn Bellamy, UK head of industrial products at KPMG, an accountancy firm, said:  It will be some months yet until manufacturers feel that the UK economy has turned the corner, but the first small signs that inflation may have peaked increased optimism slightly in January about cost pressures lowering soon and continuing to fall as the year goes on.  Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, a consultancy, said:  January\u2019s S&amp;P survey brings some hope that the downturn in the manufacturing sector is slowing down.  He said expectations of future orders might reflect \u201chope that lower energy prices will both reduce costs and trigger a strengthening in underlying consumer demand later this year.\u201d  The total orders, export orders and output balances, however, all remained weaker in the UK than in the eurozone, suggesting that Brexit damage is continuing to build slowly, as contracts come up for renewal.  Maddie Walker, a managing director at Accenture, another consultancy, said:  It\u2019s a mixed landscape for manufacturers right now. There are signs from across the economy that inflation is easing. However, the impact continues to be felt as energy costs and pricing remain well above the average that businesses have gotten used to. Certain industries, such as car production, also continue to be hampered by semiconductor shortages and factory closures.      9.53am    Six months of contraction effectively means that UK manufacturing is in recession. But is the worst over? Almost 57% of manufacturers reported that output would be higher one year from now, and average input costs rose at the slowest rate for 27 months. So the squeeze may ease. But the indicators of what is happening now suggest it is tough going. Companies are getting less new work, and they are struggling to get hold of raw materials and staff. New work has, in fact, fallen for eight consecutive months, with fewer orders from the US, Europe and Asia \u2013 \u201cespecially China\u201d. \u201cOngoing port and Brexit issues also had an impact,\u201d S&amp;P Global said. Rob Dobson, director at S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence, said:  UK manufacturers faced a tough operating environment at the start of 2023, leading to reducing intakes of new business, declining production volumes and lower staffing levels. Weak demand at home and overseas, supply chain constraints, strikes and the continuing impact of high inflation all stymied the performance of manufacturers. Weak economic growth in the US, EMEA and across Asia is also dragging down new export wins, exacerbating the strain already caused by port delays and lingering Brexit complications. There were some shoots of positivity developing, however. Rates of contraction are generally lower than before the turn of the year, a possible sign that we may be past the worst of the downturn in industry. Cost inflation also eased further, while supply chain delays were the least pronounced for three years. Manufacturers\u2019 confidence is also reviving from recent lows, hitting a nine-month high, though the mood continued to be darkened by concerns about inflation and the possibility of recession.      9.39am   UK manufacturing contracts for sixth month in a row  The British manufacturing sector contracted in January for the sixth month in a row as it was hit by inflation, shortages and weak demand, according to the closely followed purchasing managers\u2019 index (PMI). The index reading for January was 47 points, below the 50 mark that signifies an expansion in output, according to survey compilers S&amp;P Global.  That was higher than the December reading, which was the worst in 31 months. (If we were to exclude the pandemic, when factories big and small felt forced to shut, then it was a level not seen since 2009 in the financial crisis.)   Updated at 9.40am GMT    9.22am    Thomas Rinn, global industrial lead at the consultancy Accenture, has sent us his thoughts on the eurozone PMI.  Today\u2019s PMI results reflect what we are hearing and seeing in the European manufacturing/industrial market. If you look at recent earnings, industrial businesses leading in digitalisation are reporting strong sales, and in some cases even record profits. The biggest challenges facing the eurozone manufacturing/industrial sector right now include supply chain disruption, given the scarcity of materials, and access to talent, in what is a tough labour market. Companies looking to build resilience and to be well-equipped to action change in the face of these external pressures should look at investing in new technologies, such as cloud, operations automation, upskilling employees and rebalancing their supply networks \u2013 and they must do this in a responsible manner   Updated at 9.24am GMT    9.14am   Eurozone manufacturing downturn eases  The eurozone\u2019s manufacturing downturn eased further in January and cost pressures have faded.  Final Eurozone Manufacturing PMI at 48.8 (Dec: 47.8). 5-month high Final Eurozone Manufacturing Output Index at 48.9 (Dec: 47.8). 7-month high  The eurozone manufacturing sector downturn continued into the new year, with production volumes and new factory orders falling further, according to the final reading for the manufacturing PMI from S&amp;P Global. However, slower rates of contraction in both areas tentatively suggested that the worst of the sector\u2019s slump has passed. Indeed, some parts of the euro area even recorded an expansion in output in January.  Cost pressures have waned across the euro area, with input price inflation slowing to a 26-month low. That said, output charges increased at a faster pace.  The S&amp;P Global eurozone manufacturing PMI rose for a third successive month to 48.8 in January, up from 47.8 in December. While still below the 50 mark that divides growth from contraction, it was the highest reading since last August.     8.50am   GSK beats forecasts, helped by Shingrix  Britain\u2019s second-biggest drugmaker GSK has beaten forecasts with its annual results, helped by sales of its blockbuster shingles vaccine Shingrix. The company, which spun off its consumer health business Haleon last summer, reported sales of \u00a329.3bn for 2022, up 19%, and a 56% rise in pretax profits to \u00a35.6bn. Shingrix contributed \u00a33bn of sales. The drugmaker, left with its vaccines and medicines business, has developed a vaccine for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), a common respiratory virus that usually causes cold-like symptoms, but it can result in severe illness in infants and older people. GSK hopes for regulatory approval for the vaccine this year, one of four anticipated approvals. Yesterday, US rival Moderna was granted breakthrough therapy designation for its mRNA vaccine for RSV, which means a faster development and review period. Pfizer is also in the late stages of developing an RSV vaccine for adults aged 60 plus. There are no RSV vaccines at present. Emma Walmsley, the chief executive, hailed a \u201clandmark year\u201d.  2022 was a landmark year for GSK delivering the step change in performance we committed to, driven by strong growth in specialty medicines and vaccines, including record sales for Shingrix. We enter 2023 with good momentum, underpinning confidence in our ambitious sales and profit outlooks for 2026. At the same time, we continue to build a stronger portfolio and pipeline based on infectious diseases and the science of the immune system, including our potential new RSV vaccine. This momentum, together with further targeted business development, means GSK will also be in a strong position to deliver growth from 2026 onwards.  However, some analysts are concerned about GSK\u2019s long-term prospects, as some of its best-selling HIV drugs come off patent towards the end of the decade, which means generic drugmakers can make much cheaper versions.  Updated at 9.17am GMT    8.32am   Market summary  European stock markets have opened a tad higher with the UK\u2019s FTSE 100 in London up 15 points, or 0.2%, at 7,786 on positive company results. Germany\u2019s Dax is unchanged, France\u2019s CAC has edged 0.1% higher and Italy\u2019s FTSE MiB has gained 0.5%. The pound is trading slightly lower against the dollar and the euro, at $1.2317 and \u20ac1.1320. Oil prices have gained slightly, with Brent crude, the global benchmark, up 15 cents at $85.64 a barrel.  Updated at 8.34am GMT    8.29am    Here is our full story on UK house prices sliding for five months in a row:      8.11am    You can read more on our strikes blog here:      8.04am   Up to half a million workers strike today  Today is also a big strike day in the UK, in what is thought to be the biggest industrial action in a decade. Up to 500,000 workers will go on strike with thousands of schools shut, rail lines closed down and significant border disruption, as unions said negotiations on ending strikes were \u201cgoing backwards\u201d. Ministers have been accused of \u201choodwinking the public\u201d and freezing any moves towards a settlement with NHS workers and rail unions. Government sources privately conceded that optimism at the beginning of the month about bringing an end to strike action had faded. The coordinated series of strikes involves teachers, civil servants, Border Force staff and train drivers, with the government telling people to brace for \u201csignificant disruption\u201d.  Jon Stone, policy correspondent at the Independent, has tweeted:   Updated at 8.49am GMT    8.04am    Tom Bill, head of UK residential research at Knight Frank, said:  The UK housing market is headed for an annual fall in prices as mortgage rates remain notably higher than 12 months ago. To anticipate how steep, you need to look beyond the short-term distortion of the mini-budget. For example, buyers and sellers switched off early for Christmas but activity bounced back in January. The resilience of prices and sales volumes will be put to the test in the spring when larger numbers of transactions take place and by which time virtually no five-year fixed-rate mortgages below 4% will remain in circulation. We expect prices to decline 10% over the next two years as budgets get recalculated.  UK housing market analyst Neal Hudson tweeted:   Updated at 8.49am GMT    7.47am    Gabriella Dickens, senior UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, says UK house prices have further to fall.  We still think house prices will not find a floor until they have fallen by about 8% from their peak. Households\u2019 real disposable incomes will fall further over the next couple of quarters, as the government reduces its energy bills support, and as firms push through job cuts in the face of surging borrowing costs. Meanwhile, mortgage rates are over three times higher than at the start of 2022, despite falling from October\u2019s peaks, and look set to fall only slowly this year, ensuring that mortgage approvals remain near Q4\u2019s rock bottom level. Demand also will be constrained by lenders\u2019 affordability tests, which are based off Bank Rate. Many potential buyers also will wait until prices have fallen substantially. The MPC [monetary policy committee], however, should have some scope to reduce Bank Rate next year, once slack has emerged in the labour market. In addition, the recent sharp fall in wholesale energy prices suggests that real incomes will recover in the second half of the year. As a result, we revised up last week our forecast for the subsequent recovery in house prices over the course of 2024, to 5.0%, from 3.7%.   Updated at 7.49am GMT    7.35am   Introduction: UK house price growth slows to lowest rate since mid-2020; all eyes on Fed decision  Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the world economy and the financial markets. The year has begun with a further slowdown in UK house price growth. Annual house price growth slowed to 1.1% in January from 2.8% in December, the lowest rate since June 2020, said Nationwide building society. Property values fell 0.6% in January from December, following a 0.3% drop in December, marking the fifth monthly decline in a row, the worst string of falls since the financial crisis in 2008.  The average home is now worth \u00a3258,297, down from \u00a3262,068 a month ago, and prices are 3.25% lower than their August peak. Robert Gardner, Nationwide\u2019s chief economist, said:  However, there are some encouraging signs that mortgage rates are normalising, but it is too early to tell whether activity in the housing market has started to recover. The fall in house purchase approvals in December reported by the Bank of England largely reflects the sharp decline in mortgage applications following the mini-budget. \u201cIt will be hard for the market to regain much momentum in the near term as economic headwinds are set to remain strong, with real earnings likely to fall further and the labour market widely projected to weaken as the economy shrinks. \u201cAs we highlighted in our recent affordability report, the biggest change in terms of housing affordability for potential buyers over the last year has been the rise in the cost of servicing the typical mortgage as a result of the increase in mortgage rates.  The main event today is the US Federal Reserve\u2019s meeting. America\u2019s central bank is expected to raise interest rates by 25 basis points to 4.75%, a more modest hike than in previous months, but the question remains whether it will then pause for breath. Markets assume that the Fed will start cutting rates before the end of the year, as inflation slows. Fed chair Jerome Powell\u2019s press conference following the decision should give some clues as to the Fed\u2019s thinking. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said:  It is this disconnect between the Fed\u2019s rhetoric and what the market is pricing which makes today\u2019s rate decision and Powell press conference very much a \u201clive\u201d meeting. How does Powell square how the Fed sees the path of future rate rises and the markets\u2019 belief that the central bank will start cutting rates again before the year is out. While Fed officials have insisted that rates will stay high for some time to come, the markets simply don\u2019t believe them, especially when several key inflation indicators have shown that prices are still coming down on a steady trajectory. This is what makes today\u2019s Powell press conference such a tricky proposition when it comes to market positioning. The danger for the Fed is in allowing the market to continue to think that rates are likely to come down this year, which in turn could see inflation take off again, especially with the labour market being as tight as it is. Powell simply can\u2019t afford for financial conditions to loosen and for the inflation genie to get out of the bottle again.

                    "body": "Good morning, and here\u2019s a riddle to start your day: what needs fuel in its tank, but also has to be balanced? What will turn into a black hole if we don\u2019t fix its roof when the sun is shining? What will max out its credit card if we don\u2019t live within our means? The answer, of course, is not a motorhome floating through space and brandishing a Visa, but the economy \u2013 or, more accurately, the economy as Conservatives think about it. From Margaret Thatcher to Boris Johnson via David Cameron and George Osborne, all of those visions of the limits on the state\u2019s financial firepower are framed by the right. All of them rely on a \u201ccommon sense\u201d idea so intuitive as to seem like a truism: the amount you have available to spend is strictly constrained by the amount you pay. Why am I ruining your morning with overworked Tory metaphors? Because inflation hit 9% yesterday, and the accompanying cost of living crisis will most painfully impact the poorest. Almost every one of today\u2019s front pages covers the situation. Today\u2019s newsletter is about some of the ways to reduce the pain \u2013 and the heretical suggestion that a truism might not actually be true. That mindblowing idea, and several others, are right after the headlines. Five big stories  Conservatives | Tory party officials came under increasing pressure to remove the whip from an MP arrested over claims of rape and sexual assault, as it emerged one alleged offence is connected to someone under 18. Cost of living | Police officers should use their \u201cdiscretion\u201d when deciding whether to prosecute people who steal in order to eat, the new chief inspector of constabulary told the Guardian. Ukraine | The UN warned that the war in Ukraine has helped to stoke a global food crisis that could last years if it goes unchecked, as the World Bank announced an additional $12bn in funding to mitigate its \u201cdevastating effects\u201d. Deportation | A Home Office deportation flight to Jamaica took off with seven people on board. The government reportedly had a list of 100 people it hoped to remove on the flight. Health | More than 42 million adults in the UK will be overweight or obese by 2040 and at higher risk of cancer, an \u201calarming\u201d new report reveals. Some 71% of people are expected to be overweight by 2040, against 64% today.  In depth: Rebooting the debate on cost of living  For a sense of the government\u2019s approach to the cost of living crisis, consider the two measures that the Treasury took out for a test drive in briefings yesterday: a \u201cwarm home discount\u201d on energy bills in England and Wales, and a 1p cut to the basic income tax rate, brought forward from next year. The former would benefit the poorest 3m, and will cost about \u00a31bn. The latter will be spread out across everybody, including those who have barely noticed the spike in their bills \u2013 and is worth five times as much.  Meanwhile, many Conservatives are blaming the Bank of England for not raising interest rates early enough to keep inflation under control \u2013 but as the bank\u2019s governor Andrew Bailey said on Monday, \u201cwe can\u2019t predict things like wars \u2013 that\u2019s not in anybody\u2019s power.\u201d Randeep Ramesh, the Guardian\u2019s chief leader writer, says that it\u2019s time to think bigger, and quotes John Maynard Keynes\u2019 view that trying to beat a recession with monetary policy \u2013 the measures available to a central bank to control the supply of money \u2013 is like \u201cpushing a piece of string\u201d. Instead, he argues, we need to let go of the idea that big fiscal interventions \u2013 spending more money \u2013 are irresponsible. \u201cThere have long been injunctions that you can\u2019t run big deficits or you go bankrupt,\u201d he said. \u201cThroughout coronavirus, central banks showed that there didn\u2019t have to be this artificial limit to spending. But these ideologies take a long time to disappear.\u201d So how did we get here? *** The status quo That pervasive idea that the country\u2019s finances are analogous to a household budget \u2013 you have to balance the books \u2013 was popularised by Margaret Thatcher, and reinforced by David Cameron\u2019s government during the austerity years. \u201cIn the mid-80s, the left didn\u2019t accept that,\u201d Randeep said. \u201cBut it was dragged to that position. The Tories cemented the analogy in people\u2019s minds.\u201d The reality of using monetary policy as your primary weapon against inflation and a cost of living crisis is that you wind up arguing, as Andrew Bailey has, that people should not ask for pay rises even as their expenses rocket. In the end, even when they succeed in keeping inflation down, those policies \u201cshift disposable income from poorer families to richer ones, and they help people who invest in the pound \u2013 which is basically the city,\u201d Randeep said.  When the government does consider big interventions, it much prefers tax cuts to new spending. Rishi Sunak\u2019s speech yesterday promising to cut taxes for business makes the front of the Daily Mail, while cabinet ministers Liz Truss and Alister Jack are on the front page of the Daily Telegraph with calls for more of the same. *** The alternative Another view of the way the economy works accepts that there are hard limits on our spending in the shape of finite resources and responsible stewardship of the planet \u2013 but adds that \u201cwhen we say we\u2019ve \u2018spent all the money\u2019 \u2013 the truth is there is no finite amount of money we can spend,\u201d Randeep said. \u201cOtherwise we wouldn\u2019t have gone through \u00a3400bn during the pandemic without breaking a sweat.\u201d This is a crisis \u201ccreated by a spike in the price of fuel, by coronavirus, by supply chain disruption,\u201d he added. \u201cIf that\u2019s what\u2019s causing inflation, the Bank of England isn\u2019t going to tame it. You have to deal with those issues differently.\u201d One measure popular with those who are sympathetic to this view \u2013 laid out by economist Torsten Bell in First Edition last week \u2013 is to bring forward an increase in benefits slated for next year. Other ideas might include a freeze in student loan repayments, greater subsidy for public transport or home insulation, and rent control. If these ideas sound revolutionary, Randeep points out versions in place in Austria, Italy, and France. In the US, Joe Biden paused federal student loan repayments, subsidised healthcare, and sent $1,400 in Covid relief to more than 100 million people. Despite those examples, in the UK, such policies remain beyond the pale. *** So why aren\u2019t we talking about it? When Labour\u2019s shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves was asked what she would do to deal with the effects of inflation on the Today programme yesterday, she talked about tax cuts and repeated Labour\u2019s policy of a windfall tax on North Sea oil revenues \u2013 a crowdpleasing measure that had Boris Johnson on the back foot at yesterday\u2019s Prime Minister\u2019s Questions, but one which fundamentally accepts the narrative of balancing the books. The \u00a32bn or more Labour estimates it would raise is a relatively small sum, but No 10 is still reported in The Times to view it as \u201cideologically unconservative\u201d. The problem for Labour is that it has made a commitment that new day-to-day spending will be covered by taxation. \u201cThey are hamstrung because they don\u2019t have an answer to the question \u2018Where do you get the money from?\u2019,\u201d Randeep said. \u201cLet\u2019s be honest \u2013 the economy is worth two trillion. These sums are a rounding error.\u201d  It\u2019s not like the Tories won\u2019t bend the rules when it suits them. As today\u2019s Guardian editorial says: \u201cIf the Conservatives can argue that taxes must come down to deal with inflation, even at the cost of a higher deficit, then surely Labour can argue that public spending could be increased for the same reason.\u201d Nonetheless, the right\u2019s framing of the issue has become so pervasive as to be unnoticeable, the air that we breathe. To overcome that, Randeep argues, you need to talk about \u201c[wanting to] make sure everyone has a home, can eat properly, has a good standard of living. You need to fight on different political terrain.\u201d That may still sound like a radical idea. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s radical,\u201d said Randeep. \u201cWhat is radical is this unwillingness to see beyond our self-imposed limits. We\u2019ve become an outpost for an ideology that has run its course. Through our strange political theatre, we have kept it alive.\u201d What else we\u2019ve been reading  Even the coldest heart (mine) was melted by Eurovision on Saturday - and second place for Sam Ryder was a pretty fun subplot to Ukraine\u2019s victory.

Before this seismic agreement the winnings were deeply uneven: for the men\u2019s World Cup in Qatar later this year, the prize money stood at $400m, but for women\u2019s cup in 2023 it was only $60m. This achievement is part of a wider years long battle for equal treatment for the women\u2019s football team: the US Soccer president Cindy Parlow Cone said: \u201cThese agreements have changed the game forever here in the United States and have the potential to change the game around the world.\u201d Sign up here for a weekly roundup of The Upside, sent to you every Sunday"

                    "body": "\u201cMy name is Aur\u00e9lien Tchouam\u00e9ni, OK?\u201d Real Madrid\u2019s new midfielder smiled, told the media what to call him and how \u2013 a guide to pronunciation \u2013 and then told them about the men who inspired his approach. Neither were footballers. Instead, he said, the analysis, ambition and attitude that had brought him here came from across the Atlantic: from US sporting culture, basketball especially.\n\u201cKobe Bryant, Michael Jordan: I watch videos of them, legends who got the best from themselves, who perfected their play,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can\u2019t ever rest: you have to do everything, and that\u2019s what I will do here.\u201d\nIf that was a little unexpected, it had started with a classic: Tchouam\u00e9ni lying on the bed, shirt off, the name of the clinic that carried out his medical splashed across the board behind him, suckers on his chest and thumbs up.\n\nNext came the visit to the trophy room where the 14th European Cup was added last week. Then his presentation alongside the president, Florentino P\u00e9rez \u2013 as it turned out in the appropriate setting of the basketball hall at Valdebebas. There, Tchouam\u00e9ni spoke briefly in Spanish, P\u00e9rez appearing to accompany his words at one point. Happy to be at Madrid, he said it was time to write his history.\nIt needn\u2019t have been written here and much was made of the fact that it will be. There had been negotiations with other clubs, he said. Liverpool had pulled out as the price rose, pushed higher by the other, more significant bidder who also had a very significant negotiator.\n\u201cKylian [Mbapp\u00e9] stayed at Paris Saint-Germain; he knew that I was going to go from Monaco at the end of the season and he wanted to see if maybe I would go to PSG,\u201d Tchouameni said. \u201cBut my first decision was always Real Madrid, and he respects that.\u201d\nMadrid paid \u20ac80m for the 22-year-old, a fee that could rise to \u20ac100m, but Tchouameni said he wasn\u2019t interested in that: that was between the clubs. All that mattered now \u2013 and not just to him \u2013 was that he was where he wanted to be.\n\u201cI had the chance to choose other teams but when I found out that Real Madrid were interested in me, I didn\u2019t doubt for a second,\u201d he said. \u201cI want to leave my mark on football history and I think Madrid is the best place to do that: the biggest club in the world, with incredible players and the best club for me.\n\u201cI spoke to other clubs but a part of my head was always waiting for the call from Madrid and when they came to my door, I didn\u2019t hesitate. I spoke to my agent, my family and the club [Monaco] to try to get the best deal for everyone.\u201d\nIf he wavered, watching the Champions League helped, he said. \u201cWhen I was watching the final against Liverpool there were already negotiations with Madrid and other teams, but it is true that when I saw [what happened against] PSG, Chelsea, [Manchester] City, I was messaging people saying: \u2018Please do all you can to take me to Madrid. I can\u2019t not go there.\u2019\u201d\n\nThis club still has something others do not and that was cause for celebration. P\u00e9rez\u2019s speech was short but he repeated a line about Tchouam\u00e9ni having chosen to come to Madrid that appeared rather pointed. Emilio Butrague\u00f1o then said something very similar: they knew he could have gone to PSG and were grateful he had not, unlike a certain someone.\nMadrid feel Mbapp\u00e9 had let them down and feared his decision could be a glimpse of the future. That made this signing an even bigger success. There was even a question, upon which Tchouam\u00e9ni did not bite, as to whether he had chosen glory over money. The \u201cunlike Mbappe\u201d went without saying.\nThat he was here not there mattered and not just emotionally. These are foundations laid for the future, Tchouam\u00e9ni the most sought-after midfielder in Europe and part of a succession plan for the men P\u00e9rez calls \u201cthe three tenors\u201d: Casemiro, Toni Kroos and Luka Modric, winners of 14 European Cups between them at Madrid, a history unmatched and unlikely to ever be matched either. He joins Fede Valverde, 23, and Eduardo Camavinga, who is 19, a new generation, the identity evolving.\nIt won\u2019t happen immediately and certainly not all in one go \u2013 Casemiro is 30, Kroos 32 and Modric has just signed another one-year extension three months from his 37th birthday \u2013 but even they can\u2019t resist time for ever and the transition is under way. Valverde played 46 games last season and a recurring theme of Madrid\u2019s European Cup comebacks was the introduction of Camavinga. By the end of the semi-final victory over Manchester City, none of the tenors were on the pitch. All three started the final.\nFor now, Tchouam\u00e9ni comes to complement and compete, not necessarily replace, providing depth and something different, cover for Casemiro, who had none. But that is not all he is. He talked about lessons learned from Cesc F\u00e0bregas, his teammate at Monaco, and defined himself as an intelligent player who has the physical condition to win the ball. No one in Europe had more recoveries this season.\n\nHe took No 18 because it was the nearest to his favoured No 8, which Kroos owns, and said he watched and learned from Casemiro. Having played most of his career in a midfield pair, in Madrid\u2019s 4-3-3 he believes he can operate as \u201ca 6 or an 8\u201d, knows that even getting in the team is a \u201cchallenge\u201d, and said he took inspiration from the teammates who await him and from whom he will one day take over.\nThis, after all, was his first day, the end a long way off. \u201cIf I win five European Cups, it means I won\u2019t have done too badly,\u201d he said."

                    "body": "A row has broken out over the appointment of the EU\u2019s first ever special envoy to the Gulf, as internal critics allege the frontrunner, the former Italian foreign minister Luigi Di Maio, is poorly qualified for the job. Di Maio, a former leader of the anti-establishment Five Star Movement (M5S), served as Italy\u2019s foreign minister for just over three years until last month. He has now been selected by a panel of European officials as the best of four candidates to become the EU\u2019s special representative to the Gulf states, beating veteran politicians with more experience. The final decision is expected to be taken by the EU\u2019s high representative for foreign affairs, Josep Borrell, later this month or in early December. Borrell may also invite the EU\u2019s 27 member states to vote on the appointment. EU critics allege that Di Maio has a poor record in the Gulf, saying he presided over a breakdown in relations between Rome, the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia through his clumsy implementation of a ban on arms sales voted for by the Italian parliament. In January 2021 the Italian government revoked the sale of thousands of missiles and aircraft bombs to Saudi Arabia and the UAE because of their use in Yemen. Announcing the ban at the time, Di Maio said the move was \u201ca clear message of peace coming from our country\u201d and showed an \u201cunbreakable commitment\u201d to human rights. In June 2021 the UAE ordered Italy to move its forces out of the Al Minhad military airbase in Dubai in apparent retaliation for the arms embargo. Italy had used the base for flights to Iran, Afghanistan and the Horn of Africa during many multinational missions. Di Maio\u2019s critics say the ban was poorly communicated to Gulf leaders, provoking diplomatic consequences for Italy not faced by other EU member states who took similar action. Cinzia Bianco, an expert on the Gulf region at the European Council on Foreign Relations, blamed Di Maio for provoking \u201cthe most severe diplomatic crisis between Italy and the United Arab Emirates in the contemporary history of relations between the countries\u201d. If he became the EU\u2019s special envoy to the region, she said, it would be the \u201cpremature death \u2026 of some kind of European Union policy, presence, agency in the Gulf\u201d. One source with insider knowledge said the panel should have taken into account this incident and other perceived foreign policy missteps, such as Di Maio\u2019s trip to Paris in 2019 to meet \u201cgilets jaunes\u201d (yellow vest) protesters, an incident that soured relations with the French government. \u201cThis [appointment] sends a very, very bad message,\u201d the person said. \u201cIt\u2019s a completely insane decision and the real question is why Josep Borrell is taking this huge risk.\u201d According to two internal sources, Di Maio won over the panel, leapfrogging over more experienced candidates, including a Greek former European commissioner, Dimitris Avramopoulos, who has been his country\u2019s foreign minister and defence minister, and has also had stints in charge of health and tourism. Other candidates are Slovakia\u2019s J\u00e1n Kubi\u0161, a former foreign minister, who has held several UN positions in the Middle East and north Africa, and Cypriot Markos Kyprianou, another former foreign minister and EU commissioner. A second source, who said they were unimpressed with the shortlist, said Di Maio\u2019s approval from the panel \u201chas already sparked some debate\u201d and that Borrell \u201cmay reconsider\u201d its decision. \u201cBut that would then also be a problem,\u201d the EU source said. \u201cNow there is this debate around the candidate and that weakens Luigi Di Maio and it would weaken whoever comes after him.\u201d Hannah Neumann, a German Green MEP who chairs the European parliament\u2019s delegation for relations with the Arabian peninsula, said she was disappointed that no women had made the shortlist. \u201cI think it would have been a strong sign to send a woman there. And we have enough women in the European Union with expertise in security questions, as well as working on and with the Gulf countries.\u201d The EU envoy to the Gulf needed to be someone \u201cwho really communicates fairly and on eye level with the leadership in the Gulf countries, and who is accepted by them\u201d, she added. Di Maio, aged 21, was among the first to join the populist Five Star Movement upon its inception in 2009. He did not finish his university studies, and his work experience before getting into politics included waiting tables, labouring on construction sites, and stewarding at a football stadium in Naples. But in 2013, aged 26, he became the youngest person ever to be elected as deputy house speaker, and in the 2018 general elections led his party to power. He soon became known for his gaffes, including calling for the Italian president, Sergio Mattarella, to be impeached after he vetoed a controversial pick for finance minister, and mistakenly calling the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, \u201cPing\u201d during a visit to China in 2018. However, as Di Maio matured in the role of foreign minister, especially in Mario Draghi\u2019s government, he distanced himself from the Five Star Movement, and completely broke ranks with the party last summer. He admitted to being naive in the past, especially over the calls for Mattarella\u2019s impeachment and support for the gilets jaunes. Since Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, the EU has moved relations with the oil and gas-rich Gulf region up its priority list. In May, the bloc unveiled its ambitions for \u201ca strategic partnership\u201d with the six countries of the Gulf Cooperation Council: Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar, Oman and the United Arab Emirates.  Di Maio\u2019s appointment was championed by the former prime minister Mario Draghi, although Italy\u2019s new government has not said whether it supports him. A source close to Di Maio said the process had been followed correctly, adding that Gulf countries \u201cappreciated the work he did as a foreign minister\u201d. The source added that after Di Maio became foreign minister, he met his UAE and Saudi Arabia counterparts \u201cdozens of times\u201d and maintained \u201coptimal relations\u201d. A European Commission spokesperson said the procedure to nominate the EU\u2019s special representative for the Gulf \u201chas not been finalised yet\u201d and declined to \u201cparticipate in media speculations\u201d."

                    "body": "Stevenage could only name six substitutes but two of them, Jamie Reid and Dean Campbell, scored the goals, in the 88th and 90th minutes, that enabled the League Two title chasers to pull off the shock of all the shocks in this remarkable FA Cup third round and come from behind to beat seven-times winners Aston Villa, 59 places above them in football\u2019s pecking order. Villa thought they had finally brought an end to their abysmal third-round record when with two minutes remaining, leading through Morgan Sanson\u2019s first-half goal, Leander Dendoncker received a ball from his goalkeeper Robin Olsen on the edge of his own box.  It is the kind of customary risk Premier League midfielders invariably take. But as the Belgium international attempted to turn past his man, Campbell was not having it. The Scotland youth international, on loan from Aberdeen, dispossessed Dendoncker, who proceeded to pull his shirt just outside the penalty area before taking his foot away, just inside. Graham Scott initially awarded a free-kick before glancing over at his assistant who justly flagged for a penalty. After all, Campbell had earned the advantage to get into the box. Reid, who scored in the second-round win at Kings Lynn, kept his composure from 12 yards to drill in the spot-kick, sending Olsen the wrong way. Dendoncker was sent off. Villa, who lost at this stage of the competition for the seventh successive season, were shell-shocked. Jake Reeves, impressive throughout, was allowed to take a short corner to Campbell, left free by Villa. He ventured into the corner of the penalty area before drilling his shot past Olsen at the near post. Unai Emery may have made eight changes to his Premier League side but, having won the Europa League three times with Sevilla, the FA Cup was high on his agenda after winning three of his first four games in charge at Villa Park. Instead, the glory of a fourth-round trip to Stoke City belongs to Stevenage. Defeated just once in 15 games, and that to Portsmouth in the Football League Trophy, Stevenage\u2019s confidence never dipped. Their social media team even suggested, at 1-0 down, that Philippe Coutinho\u2019s substitution took longer than usual because Villa had to dig him out of Luther James-Wildin\u2019s back pocket first. It had been calculated that Stevenage\u2019s 3-1 win over Newcastle United in 2011 ranked third in the top 50 third-round shocks of the past half-century. This one at least equals that. For Villa, the ignominy will be hard to shake off. The FA Cup represented Villa\u2019s main opportunity of glory this season. Surely that is more glamorous than any late surge towards seventh in the Premier League and the allure of the Europa Conference League. Opportunity also knocked for several players who have become peripheral at Villa Park but none really grasped theirs.  Stevenage had broken through in the 17th minute only for Luke Norris to time his run off the back of Matty Cash just too early. Danny Rose finished neatly with a low side footed effort into the bottom of the corner before the VAR assured Scott the offside flag had been correctly raised. Coutinho, afforded his first start since his mentor Steven Gerrard was sacked in October, was one with much to prove. But the former Liverpool star too often cut back inside on to his right foot to dispatch shots that rose too high or allowed Taye Ashby-Hammond, the goalkeeper on loan from Fulham who helped Boreham Wood reach the fifth round last season, to save comfortably. Sanson was another keen to show Emery he deserves a future here. Signed from Marseille for \u00a316m two years ago, he scored his first goal for Villa on his first start since last February. It was a beautifully worked goal, full of one-touch layoffs. Coutinho fed Douglas Luiz and when Leon Bailey invited Danny Ings to play in Sanson, the Frenchman took a touch to steady himself before dispatching a crisp drive into the far bottom corner. If the sizeable home crowd thought the floodgates would open, the 3,000 Stevenage fans had other ideas. Norris, having scored in the previous two rounds against Gateshead and Kings Lynn, almost extended his cup heroics but his cross-shot deflected off the top of the woodwork. Stevenage continued to acquit themselves with credit in the second half, even after Bailey crashed a shot wide from close range and Ings shot over after what seemed like a million passes. Steve Evans\u2019s side were content to allow Villa possession and then look for their chances on the break or from set-pieces. The captain Carl Piergianni headed Jake Reeves\u2019 corner wide. The latter then steered a shot from 20 yards just wide. Stevenage were still in this, even as Calum Chambers tickled a shot just wide from Coutinho\u2019s last contribution amidst a raft of substitutes. Stevenage could only name six, a measure of their squad depth. What they lacked in resources, they more than made up for in heart and belief. How their fans celebrated on the final whistle."

                    "body": "Patrick Stewart was born in the neighbourhood, and the Sex Pistols played their final British gig here in 1977 but this weekend the West Yorkshire town of Huddersfield will be at the centre of the sporting world like never before. Huddersfield has its place in British sporting folklore already secure: it is where rugby league was founded in 1895 and Huddersfield Town were once the driving force of English football, the first club to win the league three times in a row, from 1924-26. But the town nestled on the edge of the Pennines and in the shadow of Leeds and Manchester \u2013 geographically and metaphorically \u2013 has never known a time like this. On Saturday, Huddersfield Giants will aim to win rugby league\u2019s Challenge Cup for the first time since 1953 when they face Wigan in the final at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium.  That alone would have heightened the mood in an area that was once at the heart of Britain\u2019s textile boom, but 24 hours later Huddersfield Town seek a return to the Premier League in the Championship playoff final at Wembley, with Nottingham Forest their opponents. Sport plays a huge role in the mood of folk in this part of the world and never has that been more apparent than now. \u201cI get emails from constituents all the time and in the last few weeks, they\u2019ve been all about Giants and Town,\u201d says Jason McCartney, the Conservative MP for Colne Valley. His constituency covers most of the major suburbs in and around Huddersfield and as an ardent supporter of both clubs who will be present at both games, he understands the magnitude of this weekend for his home town: on and off the pitch. \u201cI was in London last weekend and saw Sunderland supporters taking over Trafalgar Square and it hit home just how special a weekend this will be for our town,\u201d he says. \u201cIt goes beyond sport. It could kickstart the town\u2019s fortunes and take it to the next level in terms of economic growth.\u201d  One of the most prominent local businessmen is Ken Davy. He has owned the rugby league club since 1996 and was briefly chairman of Town, having led the bid to save them in 2003. \u201cThere have been times in the past where the two clubs haven\u2019t probably connected how people would have liked but nowadays, it\u2019s tremendous,\u201d he says of the clubs, who share the John Smith\u2019s Stadium on the outskirts of the town centre. \u201cWeekends like this, do they ever happen for towns like Huddersfield? I\u2019m not sure they do. There is the chance to make the dreams of tens of thousands of people come true in unique circumstances. Little old Huddersfield will be taking over London.\u201d  There are similarities between the clubs that represent this town with such pride. Both were given little chance to get to this stage, with the Giants outsiders for the Challenge Cup and Town even less fancied to be in the mix for promotion. \u201cIt\u2019s such a great club because the people around here get behind you if you\u2019re willing to put your bodies on the line,\u201d says Jonathan Hogg, the Town captain. \u201cWe\u2019ve a great bunch of lads who don\u2019t complain and moan and that\u2019s what this town wants. Huddersfield is buzzing, everywhere you go. It\u2019s going to be a special weekend to be a part of. If your local team does well it gives everyone a real buzz locally. It makes a huge difference to where people live but to have both teams in finals is unheard of.\u201d  Success for both clubs could even transform Huddersfield\u2019s temporary position on the sporting landscape to a more permanent position, potentially leading to greater fortunes for the town. You can see the history at almost every turning if you travel through the centre of Huddersfield or any of its suburbs, but a lack of serious redevelopment in recent years has left some frustrated. Sporting success could be the catalyst for that to change. \u201cIf Giants and Town win, that will only help our case to bring more investment to the area,\u201d McCartney says. \u201cTown being in the Premier League brings huge opportunities that could bring parts of the town back to life. I often say that you don\u2019t see any cranes in Huddersfield, there are no developments under way and the future of the town is in the balance. But sport is transcending what happens on the field these days and success for both brings economic benefits and enhancements we need.\u201d The Giants say Town\u2019s progression to the playoff final has boosted their support heading to Tottenham, with many fans of both clubs now extending their stay. They include the family of the Town striker Danny Ward, the club\u2019s top scorer this season. \u201cMy wife\u2019s family support both teams so it\u2019s going to be a big weekend for them,\u201d he says. \u201cThey\u2019re all going for the full weekend.  \u201cIt\u2019s crazy, but also brilliant for the town. The buzz has been incredible. These things don\u2019t come around very often so for them to be on the same weekend for both clubs, it\u2019s absolutely brilliant.\u201d For Town, the glitz and glamour of the Premier League is one win away and for the Giants there is a chance to end years of lingering in the shadows in a sport that was founded so close to where they play. Perhaps the only people who could enjoy it more than the fans of either club are the local burglars as, for the next few days, Huddersfield will be pretty quiet with a large slice of the population 200 miles down the M1 taking over the capital. \u2022 This article was amended on 27 May 2022 to qualify a reference to Huddersfield as Patrick Stewart\u2019s birthplace. The actor\u2019s birthplace of Mirfield lies within the Metropolitan Borough of Kirklees, administered from Huddersfield."

The Liverpool manager will reach the milestone against Chelsea on Saturday. Klopp has won 548 of his 999 matches, having managed 270 games for Mainz, 319 for Borussia Dortmund and 410 for Liverpool. \u201cIt is a massive thing, a crazy number \u2013 I feel really blessed,\u201d he said. \u201cThe beard is really grey now, and that was not the case when I arrived here. I\u2019m not sure if that is because of the age or because of Liverpool. I did the job I loved for the clubs I loved so I am blessed.\u201d  Klopp\u2019s managerial career began almost 22 years ago when he was placed in temporary charge of relegation-threatened Mainz, where he spent most of his playing career, and tasked with keeping the club in Bundesliga 2. They survived by three points thanks to six wins in the final seven games but Klopp believes he would not have landed the job permanently had the club gone down. \u201cIf we lost one more I think we would have been relegated,\u201d he said. \u201cTo win five from the first seven would have been an outstanding number but no one would have recognised it; you just go down to the third league and a promising coaching career would be finished before it really started. I was lucky that didn\u2019t happen. \u201cThe job I do today is completely different but my advice would be: be open, work hard, be curious, nosey, look around the corners and try to find solutions for the problems you don\u2019t have in the moment but will have in the future. The most important thing is be busy, learn the game. \u201cCoaching is like golf: when you think you have got it the game will tell you differently. You always have to develop and that is what I like most about it. It was not for one second boring \u2013 that is the best thing you can say about your working life and the best thing I can imagine to do.\u201d Liverpool supporters\u2019 union Spirit of Shankly, the Liverpool Disabled Supporters Association and Football Supporters Europe, meanwhile, have condemned the reduced ticket allocation for Liverpool\u2019s Champions League tie at Real Madrid in March. Liverpool fans have been given only four wheelchair tickets \u2013 located in the home section \u2013 and a reduced allocation of 1,800 for the last-16 second leg because of the redevelopment of the Bernab\u00e9u. Uefa regulations state that host clubs must provide 5% of their capacity as an away allocation but Liverpool have been offered 3%. In a joint statement, the supporters\u2019 groups said: \u201cIt is entirely unacceptable for a club to openly disregard Uefa regulations as well as its responsibility to supporters in this manner. The reduced away allocation, if left unchanged, risks setting a worrying precedent for clubs to tamper with Uefa\u2019s regulations and bend them to their own preference as they see appropriate. Real Madrid must abide by Uefa\u2019s regulations on away allocations.\u201d"

                    "body": "Good morning. The chancellor, Kwasi Kwarteng, has cut short his trip to Washington, returning to London for urgent talks in Downing Street because of widespread expectations that another massive U-turn, this time on a cut to corporation tax, is imminent. Read on for the latest developments. A decision could be made before the markets open, so keep a close eye on the Guardian homepage for the latest. This U-turn is partly a response to the news that the bond market rallied yesterday on rumours of the change \u2013 but the Bank of England\u2019s historic \u00a365bn bond-buying intervention to protect pension funds comes to an end today. Investors want certainty on what\u2019s happening next. If this is hard to wrap your head around, don\u2019t worry \u2013 it\u2019s confusing. The key is to understand why the Bank made that intervention, and why its end matters so much. To make sense of all that, I spoke to Guardian economics correspondent Richard Partington about how we got here, and what might happen next. That\u2019s after the headlines. Five big stories  Finance | Research by the Trades Union Congress has found that bankers bonuses have doubled since the 2008 financial crash. The TUC says bonuses in the finance and the insurance sector have reached \u00a320,000 a year on average. Twitter | Federal authorities are investigating Elon Musk\u2019s $44bn takeover deal with Twitter. It is not clear which authorities are investigating or what the focus of the inquiry will be. US | A Florida jury has recommended life in prison for Nikolas Cruz, the 24-year-old responsible for the 2018 Marjory Stoneman Douglas high school shooting, the deadliest such act in US history. Cruz killed 14 students and three staff members. Social care | The Guardian has obtained footage that reveals an 88-year-old woman with dementia was mentally and physically abused in Reigate Grange, a luxury UK care home that can cost up to \u00a3100,000 a year. Education | A landmark court judgment has given students from migrant families in Scotland the same right to free university tuition as their peers.  In depth: \u2018The government had essentially lost credibility\u2019  In the immediate aftermath of September\u2019s mini-budget, the pound plummeted to record lows and international investors lost faith in the ability of the government to service its debts \u2013 thus pushing up the interest rate the UK faces to borrow. So the Bank of England stepped in. In the simplest terms, it offered to buy government bonds \u2013 known as gilts in the UK \u2013 to help calm disorderly and panicked banks and investors who faced a market with free falling prices. UK pension funds in particular were losing huge sums of money on account of the market\u2019s sudden shift. It also gave the government time to \u201cadjust\u201d its plans \u2013 and it sounds like the corporation tax U-turn is being timed to coincide with it ending. So, what does this all mean? And how concerned should we be? Richard Partington helps me to break it all down. *** Why are gilt yields rising? \u201cIt\u2019s all sort of a mess,\u201d Richard begins \u2013 a great sign for the country\u2019s future prospects (but hopefully not today\u2019s newsletter).  There is no single thing that has caused all these problems, Richard notes: \u201cThere\u2019s a global factor and a UK specific factor.\u201d Since Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, inflation has been soaring. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has predicted that global inflation will rise to 8.8% this year \u2013 a significant increase from 4.7% in 2021. This in turn has increased the cost of living across advanced economies. \u201cInflation is at the highest levels in 40 years and the world\u2019s big central banks \u2013 the Bank of England, the US Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank \u2013 are trying to tackle that by raising interest rates, and as a consequence of that you\u2019ve seen gilt yields rising as well,\u201d Richard explains. The idea is that raising interest rates reduces inflation by reducing spending (either because borrowing to pay things like mortgages and cars is too expensive, or because saving is better value when returns are higher). So one would expect the Bank\u2019s course of action to raise borrowing costs for government, but not by this much \u2026  The other, arguably far more important, factor in this mess is specific to the UK. After Kwasi Kwarteng\u2019s mini-budget, where he unveiled the biggest tax cuts in half a century without explaining how the government would pay for them, the markets balked. \u201cThe financial markets thought that the government was going too far. It was ramping up the budget deficit to a degree which made it look as though the government is irresponsible,\u201d Richard says.  These decisions were being made in a country that already had a large national debt, a large deficit and a weak economy. It was clear to international investors that things weren\u2019t adding up. \u201cThey didn\u2019t believe the claim that these tax cuts will pay for themselves or lead to stronger economic growth,\u201d Richard says. In the eyes of most speculators, it looked as though the British government was going to be permanently running up its budget deficit. There was no longer any real belief that Britain had a plan to balance its books and this loss in confidence is why things seem to be so much worse in the UK: \u201cAll of this has led to borrowing costs on international markets rising much more substantially than for other countries \u2013 because the government had essentially lost credibility.\u201d *** Why was the Bank of England buying UK bonds? For the last decade, central banks around the world have kept interest rates close to zero and pursued a policy of quantitative easing (which is basically the fancy term for central banks electronically printing money to keep borrowing cheap for governments and households). But given rising inflation, central banks have decided it\u2019s time to pull back on this policy, to fight inflation, and move into a period of \u201cquantitative tightening\u201d. With the desire to reduce spending by the central bank, the dramatic decision to intervene in the bond market was a reluctant and temporary one to help pension funds recover from their exposure to volatile markets and prevent problems in that sector from spreading outwards to the wider financial markets. But to continue buying up government bonds indefinitely would contradict the Bank\u2019s monetary ambition to tackle inflation. *** What\u2019s happening today?  Given the Bank\u2019s desire to stop spending, it was no surprise when earlier this week, Andrew Bailey, the governor of the Bank of England (pictured above), announced in no uncertain terms that the emergency intervention would end today. He brusquely added that pension funds who were looking to sell gilts have \u201cthree days left\u201d. The clear end date is intended to pressure pension funds to raise money and build up cash buffers, which will insulate them from future shocks. Many in the pensions industry, including the Pensions and Lifetime Savings Association (PLSA), have said the scheme should not be ended too early. Their reasoning is that extending this intervention would give the funds more breathing room to fix the underlying problems they\u2019re facing. However, this would harm the Bank\u2019s credibility as it would be a U-turn on their announced policy. \u201cUltimately this is papering over the cracks of the real root of the problem that have caused these high yields,\u201d Richard says. *** Is my pension at risk? After speaking to pension experts, Richard says that individual pensions are not under threat \u2013 and they are also guaranteed by the government\u2019s pension protection fund. However, mortgage holders are in a far more precarious position (especially those on variable rates), because high street banks use gilt yields to price the interest rates on them. When gilt yields go up, so do mortgages. \u201cThe hope is that if the government pulls back from its unfunded tax cuts and regains its credibility in financial markets, government bond yields should fall back down,\u201d Richard says \u2013 and along with them, the rising price of mortgages will be eased. *** Did the BoE\u2019s intervention work? \u201cThere\u2019s been a lot of worry about this cliff edge facing financial markets today,\u201d Richard says, and things are still moving rapidly. On Thursday gilt yields decreased to 4.57%, after the Bank\u2019s increase in buying capacity earlier in the week, and speculation that there may be further U-turns from the government around corporation tax. \u201cWe\u2019re not out of the woods yet,\u201d Richard cautions, \u201cthere are still lots of factors that could cause an upset in financial markets. But, as the days pass, there are gradual signs that the market situation could calm.\u201d Despite this, the forecast for the political climate remains stubbornly turbulent, as the blowback on Truss, Kwarteng and the Conservatives rumbles on.

Downing Street has provoked fury and derision by still refusing to accept that the fixed-penalty notices meant definitively that the rules had been broken. There is still a possibility Johnson will be among those fined \u2013 the Met has made clear these were only the first tickets and interviews with key figures are likely in the coming weeks.\nRebel Tory MPs have said they will renew efforts to convince colleagues that the prime minister lied to parliament. Johnson attempted to shore up his leadership on Tuesday night with a dinner for Tory MPs, but a number declined to attend, and those who did were heckled by bereaved families of Covid victims as they arrived. Shouts of \u201cshame on you\u201d and \u201coff to another party are we?\u201d were directed at Michael Gove and Jacob Rees-Mogg as they turned up to the Park Plaza near Westminster Bridge.\nSenior Tory MPs such as the former attorney general Jeremy Wright have said it should mean resignation or removal from office if Johnson is found to have knowingly attended rule-breaking parties. Some MPs are reserving their judgment until the full report on the parties by senior civil servant Sue Gray is released, which will not happen until the police investigation is over. Labour\u2019s deputy leader, Angela Rayner, renewed calls for Johnson to resign: \u201cThe buck stops with the prime minister, who spent months lying to the British public, which is why he has got to go.\u201d\n* * *\n\u2018Not naive people\u2019 \u2013 Volodymyr Zelenskiy has dismissed Russia\u2019s pledge to cut back its invasion effort, saying \u201cUkrainians are not naive people\u201d and vowing to continue defensive military efforts. \u201cUkrainians have already learned during these 34 days of invasion and over the past eight years of the war in Donbas that only a concrete result can be trusted.\u201d Russia\u2019s deputy defence minister, Alexander Fomin, said after talks in Istanbul on Tuesday that Moscow wanted to \u201cincrease mutual trust\u201d to help secure a peace deal, and therefore it would \u201cradically reduce military activity in the direction of Kyiv and Chernihiv\u201d. Ukraine\u2019s armed forces responded that the Russian withdrawals were merely \u201ca rotation of individual units\u201d and the Kremlin claims were intended to \u201cmislead the military leadership\u201d of Ukraine. Zelenskiy said the \u201cpositive\u201d signals \u201cdo not drown out the explosions of Russian shells \u2026 Mariupol is blocked. Missile and airstrikes do not stop. This is the reality.

Grocery price inflation reached 5.2% in March, the highest level since April 2012. Price rises are being fuelled by the rising cost of labour and basic commodities such as wheat and cooking oil \u2013 as well as the cost of energy and packaging driven by a combination of Brexit, resurgence in demand post-lockdown and the war in Ukraine. Rising energy bills, food prices and transport costs are set to plunge many into the red with 13% of households saying they are only just about managing to cover minimum payments on credit card bills and a further 6% already unable to, according to other analysis.\n* * *\nNo authority at all \u2013 It turns out that Jackie Weaver really did have \u201cno authority here, no authority at all\u201d to remove parish councillors from a chaotic online meeting during lockdown. Video from the Handforth council Zoom meeting of December 2020 was shared by millions across the world. An independent investigation found participants\u2019 complaints were correct: the muting of microphones and removal of individual councillors \u201cwas without authority\u201d, though Weaver was only trying to do her best.\n\nWeaver, employed by the Cheshire Association of Local Councils, had been brought in to help run the meeting amid accusations of poor councillor behaviour. The fallout from the meeting has included six independent investigation reports and costs of more than \u00a385,000. Reacting to the findings, Weaver told the BBC that she felt the jury was still out on precise meeting procedure: \u201cI welcome the findings of the report but am deeply saddened that it took so long and cost so much to get there.\u201d\nToday in Focus podcast: Kadyrov\u2019s war in Ukraine\nRamzan Kadyrov, the feared Chechen leader and staunch Putin ally, has claimed to be in Ukraine commanding a unit alongside Russian forces.

Bruno Fernandes scored twice as Portugal beat stubborn visitors North Macedonia 2-0 to qualify for the World Cup finals in Qatar after a tense European playoff tie. Rubin Colwill sealed a 1-1 draw for Wales in their friendly against Czech Republic, Scotland let slip a 2-0 lead but extended their unbeaten run to eight games in a 2-2 draw with Austria in Vienna, and in Belfast, Northern Ireland were beaten 1-0 by Hungary.

                    "body": "Some of my fondest memories of friends should, by rights, be entirely forgettable. There was that time we took our books to the park and dozed. The time we sat by the sea drinking coffee, watching the waves. The time we assembled my flatpack furniture (well \u2013 I watched), ordered a pizza and watched TV. Fifteen years ago, these open-ended hangs were effortless and my social life flowed with only the lightest steer. Fast-forward to now, and \u2013 whether it\u2019s the difference between being in my 30s versus my 20s, or 2023 versus 2013, or a pile-up of both \u2013 often the best I can manage is a quick drink after work in three weeks\u2019 time. No one, myself included, is ever free to just hang out. \u201cI\u2019d love to,\u201d I say, sincerely \u2013 but there is always a \u201cbut\u201d. The author and academic Sheila Liming wants us to find the time \u2013 or, more precisely, to reclaim it. Her new book, Hanging Out: The Radical Power of Killing Time, is partly a paean to the pleasures of idling with others and partly a manifesto to \u201ctake back our social lives from the deadening whirl of contemporary life\u201d. \u201cWhen we\u2019re young, it feels like social interactions just create themselves: they happen organically, we run into each other,\u201d says Liming, at home in Vermont, when we speak over Zoom. \u201cAs we get older, they seem like something we have to put more effort into. Meetings become more structured, at times more formal \u2013 and also more of a chore.\u201d There is a desire, she says, \u201cfor more casual interactions that don\u2019t have a lot of \u2018objectives\u2019 associated with them, where there is nothing in particular you\u2019re trying to get out of it\u201d. Liming proposes a return to hanging out \u2013 \u201cmore amorphous and looser\u201d than parties, but in a world obsessed with outputs, perhaps of greater importance. Liming defines hanging out as: \u201cany time that you find yourself killing time in the presence of others \u2026 It can be something really informal, like sitting on your friend\u2019s sofa and having a cup of tea.\u201d  Rather than a particular activity, Liming says, it is an approach to socialising. For her, the gold standard was modelled by a colleague who invited Liming and her partner over for lunch. When they called to say that they were 20 minutes away, their host responded with enthusiasm, saying he would get started with the food. Then he asked: who was calling, sorry? Liming\u2019s friend was willing to make lunch for anyone with his phone number. This was several years ago, she adds. \u201cA lot has changed.\u201d These days it may feel like we don\u2019t have time for lunch at all, let alone to prepare it for friends who drop by. For office workers, technology and the associated expectation of round-the-clock availability have led to lengthening working days. Rising living costs have added to the pressure, with a reported 5.2 million UK workers taking on second jobs to cope. Leisure time, shrinking since the 1970s, is increasingly precious for women in particular, with US and UK statistics showing a stark gender gap: a reflection of uneven distribution of caring and domestic responsibilities.  What free time people do have, time-use surveys consistently show, is mostly spent watching television \u2013 perhaps because we find ourselves too exhausted to do anything else.  The barriers to hanging out go beyond simply finding the time and the energy: increasingly, they are structural. So-called \u201cthird places\u201d \u2013 those in which you can comfortably spend time outside your home or office \u2013 are disappearing due to factors such as public spending cuts, privatisation and gentrification. In big cities it can be a struggle to find places to just be together. This creates a vicious cycle of needing money to spend time with friends, and needing to work to make money. This comes at a cost, Liming argues. When busy schedules mean plans are made long into the future, they can\u2019t help but be crushed under the weight of expectation. By the time it actually happens, \u201cI\u2019ve almost talked myself out of the opportunity to enjoy it,\u201d she says.  The quality of our company is just as important as the fact of it, Liming says. \u201cWe\u2019ve all had those experiences when we\u2019re around someone who doesn\u2019t quite have the time to interact with us socially. That feeling of being squeezed in between two things \u2013 of being an obligation.\u201d I\u2019m flooded with uncomfortable memories of events where I\u2019ve had one foot out the door \u2013 mentally, physically or both \u2013 because I have tried to cram too much in: \u201cstopping by\u201d at two parties, or accepting a dinner invitation even though I\u2019m on deadline. Seeing my grimace, Liming laughs. \u201cIt\u2019s OK, it\u2019s not personal. We all do it.\u201d It is the upshot, she says, of a culture that is continuously pushing us to wring out every bit of value from our days and to \u201coptimise\u201d our lives. Those pressures have filtered down to our friendships.  The pandemic hasn\u2019t helped. \u201cIt\u2019s like those muscles that I had previously strengthened through social interactions were flabby,\u201d Liming says. Indeed, many people report that their circles have shrunk since Covid-19 \u2013 a YouGov survey last year found that 40% of Britons aged 16 and over had lost contact with some of their friends.  Meanwhile, the number of \u201ckinless\u201d adults \u2013 those who find themselves without immediate family members in later life \u2013 is expected to grow. Yet amid this reported epidemic of loneliness, there is increased understanding that relationships are essential to our mental and physical wellbeing. Social isolation and loneliness can lead to an elevated risk of heart disease, stroke and premature death, according to a 2020 report from the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine in the US.  Liming proposes hanging out as a balm that forges connection and meaning. The first step is is to seek to nourish our relationships \u2013 not simply to renew them as we might a TV licence. \u201cYou have to set that time aside and make sure you\u2019re doing it justice when you get the opportunity,\u201d she says. That may mean politely declining those invitations you would only be attending out of obligation, so as to free yourself up for the ones that matter. Liming shudders to recall how many colleagues\u2019 and distant school friends\u2019 baby showers she got \u201croped into\u201d attending in her early 30s. Relationships that we wish to maintain need not only time but space for intimacy, growth and even potential conflict. Liming writes of a disagreement she had recently with an old friend. After three hours, they had found common ground and Liming felt as if their \u201crelationship had grown tougher somehow\u201d. Had either of them been less invested, it might have been tempting to simply let the relationship cool. That is the muscle built by hanging out, says Liming, extending our tolerance for discomfort and our capacity for compassion. It is also about letting go of expectation. Hanging out doesn\u2019t always have to mean \u201ca perfect party scenario or gathering; it can be just OK\u201d. Liming gives the example of her best friend from childhood, who now lives on the opposite coast and has two young children. When they meet Liming goes along with her friend on errands or to appointments. \u201cJust seeing her in her daily life is much more interesting to me than a sort of forced environment,\u201d she says. This is how I too stay connected with faraway friends, who I see on average once every two years. Where I used to try to catch up on everybody\u2019s lives over an evening, as though I was cramming for an exam, my preference now is to dip into a few of them. I have tagged along to my sister\u2019s work drinks, attended friends\u2019 family gatherings, kept them company on their commute. It allows me to picture their days and engage more fully when we are apart. When schedules do not allow for sprawling socialising, or even face-to-face,\u201changing out on the internet is just what we have to do\u201d, says Liming. Certainly, in my experience, some digital interactions can be more rewarding than others \u2013 a few of my group chats on WhatsApp are nearly as free-flowing a source of entertainment and support as being together in person. This fits Liming\u2019s thesis that hanging out is mostly a mindset, emphasising presence over merely being present.  That can extend to interacting with those whom we often see but don\u2019t count as friends: the staff at our favourite cafe or the familiar faces at the gym. A recent large-scale study found that having a diverse \u201csocial portfolio\u201d was predictive of happiness and higher wellbeing. There are certainly risks to striking up conversations with strangers, or even allowing ourselves to be vulnerable with friends, Liming acknowledges. But: \u201cWhat\u2019s the worst thing that\u2019s going to happen?\u201d In the weeks after we speak, I experiment. I spend Saturday afternoon running errands with one nearby friend, then Sunday morning on Zoom with an old faraway one. I make a point of spacing out my work calls to allow for chat. I leave for yoga 10 minutes early and say hello to the instructor before class. I don\u2019t create any more hours in my day, but I feel the difference. My new schedule allows space for possibility: to run into a friend and not have to rush off, or to receive a last-minute invitation and reply: \u201cI\u2019d love to\u201d \u2013 no buts.

                    "body": "Ukrainians do not have the luxury of shielding themselves from bad news. \u201cI can\u2019t live outside this situation,\u201d Oleksandr Zinchenko says. \u201cTrying to follow everything is basically my life now. The first thing I do every day is reach for my phone, and then it\u2019s in my hand constantly. It\u2019s been more than seven weeks now and you can see some people starting to forget, starting to adapt to the brutality in my country. No, no, no. People are starving, dying, bodies being discovered, so how can anyone relax? You have to talk even more. I hate the people who invaded our land more and more and more every day. I won\u2019t stop talking about it, because the whole world has to know the truth.\u201d That is the exhausting but grimly necessary reality for Zinchenko and his compatriots. Every action is cast in the shadow of Russia\u2019s invasion, with its barbaric consequences, and among the biggest concerns is that people outside become desensitised. It simply would not do and, on an Easter weekend when professional commitments bring an FA Cup semi-final for Manchester City against Liverpool, he wants to use his platform. For almost an hour his anger pours out, sometimes in controlled rage but often in raw expressions of hurt. Words can capture people\u2019s attention but, in whatever order, they still cannot rationalise exactly what is happening inside Ukraine.  \u201cNot even the Russian soldiers can understand why they came,\u201d he says. \u201cWhat are they fighting for? Who for? Why would you try and fight a guy who has been hiding in a bunker for nearly two months already? These people, and I can\u2019t even call them people because there are no words for them, don\u2019t have any idea what their purpose is.\u201d One of the most profound frustrations for Zinchenko is that so many in Russia are unwilling to react and condemn. Early in his career he spent two years in the country, much of that time with FC Ufa, and made friendships that he thought would persist. But he has been let down by too many people whose support has only reached so far. \u201cI have friends over there, a small circle, but now it has reduced almost to nothing,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m so disappointed. The guys I know called me as soon as the invasion happened, texted me: \u2018I\u2019m so sorry Alex, but we can\u2019t do anything.\u2019 Of course you can. If you stay silent it means you support what is happening in Ukraine right now, and I can\u2019t see why they would. \u201cMaybe they are scared, because we see pictures on social media of Russians being taken to prison if they protest. But look at footballers in particular, or anyone with a massive audience. Can you believe that, if all of them posted something on Instagram at the same time saying: \u2018Guys, we are against the war, we need to stop it,\u2019 they would all be arrested? Of course they would not. And it\u2019s such a shame that they say nothing.\u201d Football itself plays barely any part in this conversation: we are here so that Zinchenko, one of three Ukrainian footballers in the Premier League alongside West Ham\u2019s Andriy Yarmolenko and Vitalii Mykolenko of Everton, can make his point about the tragedy unfolding in their homeland. He is grateful, though, that present colleagues offer unstinting support. Teammates at City are attentive, as are Pep Guardiola and the rest of the club\u2019s staff, and one touch was particularly appreciated. When they played at Peterborough on 1 March, Zinchenko\u2019s first outing since Russia\u2019s aggression commenced, he was made captain; the emotions were hard to keep in check as the away end, Ukraine flags displayed from one side to the other, saluted him afterwards.  \u201cMy eyes were in tears,\u201d he says. \u201cI can\u2019t explain exactly what I felt inside but, feeling that support, I was so proud to be Ukrainian. I\u2019m so thankful to the people who did it, and still do it. And it was so kind from the manager, and our captain Fernandinho, to give me this opportunity. Every day, still, they come up to me and ask how the situation is and how I am.\u201d Is it really possible to concentrate on his career? He remains an important part of City\u2019s potentially all-conquering squad but nobody would blame him for wavering. \u201cMentally, I\u2019m still thinking about Ukraine and our people, so it\u2019s not easy to train as well. But football is my life too, and it\u2019s the thing I am managing to enjoy the most, so I\u2019m trying to focus on it when I\u2019m playing. It\u2019s not easy to do, and at the beginning it was almost impossible, but now I\u2019m adapting. But I can\u2019t tell you that, at the same time, I\u2019m not thinking about Ukraine.\u201d  Zinchenko was born in Radomyshl, a city of about 15,000 inhabitants 60 miles west of Kyiv. It has a smart landscape park and a famous collection of Ukrainian religious icons from the past 500 years. He lived there until he was 11 and describes people who are \u201cso kind, so hospitable\u201d. He is in touch with many of them now, friends and family members. Most have stayed put amid the trauma; they are, thankfully, in good health as things stand and it leaves him in awe. \u201cNobody wants to leave,\u201d he says. \u201cThe men went to the army, found out where to get weapons, were ready to fight with anything they had. They weren\u2019t going to give up anything: it\u2019s their land, their home, the place where they were born and raised. This is the mentality, and I am so proud to be part of them.\u201d Radomyshl has escaped the worst, so far, but danger still feels omnipresent. A nearby town, Malyn, was shelled and there is always more. \u201cI was told Russian troops were trying to go through Radomyshl and were hiding in the woods, trying to find civilians in their cars, kill them and take everything they had,\u201d he says. The phone can never be put down. \u201cPeople can read in the news that Russian troops left the Kyiv region and everything is safe there. But I would say it\u2019s not. There are still air strikes and you have to be careful in case they regroup or replan. But everyone is ready to fight for the place they were born in.\u201d  Almost due east are Irpin and Bucha. It is when the subject of Bucha, whose hell has been the worst publicly documented so far, comes up that Zinchenko\u2019s emotions run loosest. He knows those streets; that area; these people. \u201cIt\u2019s a nightmare.\u201d He sighs at length, looks away and, in the subsequent couple of minutes, pauses several times. \u201cA shock to the whole world, the things they have done there. Terrible, scary things. They killed our civilians. They killed our children. They raped our women and girls. They killed our dogs and even ate them. I cannot even begin to describe how I feel about them. \u201cI hate them so much, for everything they have done to the Ukrainian people and Ukraine. And I hate the people in Russia who are trying to convince others that this is propaganda. It\u2019s embarrassing. How can they say this? People send me the real pictures, the real facts. The bodies of our dead civilians were lying on the ground for two weeks. They have to take responsibility for this.\u201d Zinchenko is clear: it is genocide, he says, and the invaders are attempting to erase not only the Ukrainian state but the idea of being Ukrainian, too. The fact so many Russians are blind, or in some cases blinded, to the reality of Vladimir Putin\u2019s actions is at best excruciating. \u201cYou\u2019ve got people over 50 or 60 who just watch the same TV programme that lies to you over a period of years,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ve seen videos with journalists asking Russian civilians: \u2018Do you support what your president is doing?\u2019 They answer: \u2018Yes, of course we\u2019re on his side.\u2019 And when they\u2019re asked about how they will cope with sanctions, they just say they\u2019ll suffer through it. How can you convince these people? And how can a country like this possibly function? I\u2019ve seen figures saying more than 70% of Russians support this disaster. It\u2019s incredible. I just don\u2019t get it. \u201cBut that\u2019s the difference between Ukraine and Russia. Since I\u2019ve played abroad, I\u2019ve heard a lot of people think that we are essentially the same as them. But that\u2019s not remotely true and you can see the difference between us now. In Ukraine we can speak freely, think freely, and that will be the same when we rebuild our country.\u201d Zinchenko is trying to help his compatriots and has joined the \u201cWorld Sports for Ukraine\u201d project alongside a number of other players. One of his shirts is being auctioned to raise money and other efforts are being made. \u201cIt\u2019s not just online or social media,\u201d he says of the work he and his fellow expat footballers throughout Europe are doing. \u201cWe can send a lot of things to Ukrainian people, cities; things like that. Trust me, everyone is doing a lot in every area, starting with delivering goods, finishing with the hospitality of people who are coming here.\u201d  Like many Ukrainians, Zinchenko wants to thank the UK government and Boris Johnson for their assistance. \u201cThe fact he came to Kyiv was a good signal for us,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I\u2019d like to ask as well for him to do something else for the refugees, for people to come without a visa, how we can make sure more people can come over here for help. There are so many in desperate need.\u201d The request is couched in genuine gratitude but there is also a belief that Europe in general should go further. \u201cCountries need to stop buying Russian gas and oil; they\u2019re just investing in the war that way, and in all the violence. It\u2019s important to isolate Russia from everything. One day this could happen to your country, you never know. \u201cI posted things on Instagram about stopping Russian sport. I\u2019m not wishing their footballers to stop playing in the Champions League and things like that but the more sanctions they are given, the more it might push people there to speak out and say: \u2018OK, we need to stop this together.\u2019\u201d In June, Zinchenko will represent Ukraine in their rescheduled World Cup playoff against Scotland. The country\u2019s football scene has largely ground to a halt, although Dynamo Kyiv and Shakhtar Donetsk have begun playing fundraising matches abroad, and while qualification for Qatar would be a remarkable achievement in the circumstances it has yet to become a serious thought. \u201cThe main question now is to save our country,\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t think anyone thinks about Ukrainian football now, just their families and how to make things better. But when we win this war, and I\u2019m pretty sure we\u2019re going to, we\u2019re going to build up something special. I\u2019m certain of it.\u201d  Ukraine, he says, has shown its soul to the world. \u201cIt\u2019s such a powerful spirit, a spirit of freedom. And it\u2019s a spirit to never give up, never be beaten. That\u2019s what will bring us victory.\u201d It would seem an apt way to end but Zinchenko does not want to tie things up in a bow; that is not how this horror works for anybody. The way to finish an enervating series of thought processes is to reiterate his original message. \u201cIf anyone out there thinks, \u2018I\u2019m not going to say something because I can\u2019t change anything\u2019 then that is a massive, massive mistake from them,\u201d he says. \u201cThe alternative is that you will just let this continue. You don\u2019t just have to speak about what is happening to Ukraine: you have to scream about it.\u201d"

                    "body": "It must be very strange to be \u00c9douard Mendy, a goalkeeper who seems doomed never quite to be centre stage. And when the spotlight does fall on him, it often feels it\u2019s from a strange angle, that he\u2019s not really appreciated for what he\u2019s best at. Goalkeepers perhaps struggle than other positions to be properly understood, but few seem as misunderstood as the Senegal international. In a very slightly different world, one in which Gianluigi Donnarumma had not made a vastly expensive move and saved crucial penalties in shootouts in the semi-final and final of Euro 2020, Mendy would have won a raft of goalkeeping awards last year. In a very slightly different world, he would have been seen as the hero of Chelsea\u2019s FA Cup semi-final victory over Crystal Palace on Sunday . This could have been his redemption after the error in the first leg that cost Chelsea their Champions League quarter-final against Real Madrid.  His low save to his left to keep out a Cheikhou Kouyat\u00e9 volley nine minutes before half-time was stunning, but the impact was perhaps lost because Joachim Andersen\u2019s follow-up, which cannoned back off a post, was immediately ruled offside. Kouyat\u00e9\u2019s effort would have counted, but the dramatic impact of Mendy\u2019s intervention was lost as the flag was raised. (Of course had Andersen scored, there would have been plenty lining up to say Mendy, even at full stretch, responding sharply to a snap-shot through a crowded box, should somehow have pushed the ball away from oncoming opponents.) You can make almost any case with hypotheticals, but imagine that save had come late in the game, when the score was still 1-0. Perhaps Mendy\u2019s save would not quite have gone down as one of the great FA Cup saves, a stop to rival Jim Montgomery from Peter Lorimer in 1973, David Seaman from Paul Peschisolido in 2003 or Kasper Schmeichel from Ben Chilwell last year, but he would have been hailed as a key figure. As it is, his save just joined the mulch of a largely indifferent first half. There were long spells before half-time of boilerplate superclub against mid-table football: the former probed too slowly to look really threatening, and the latter resisted, offering the occasional glimmer of a threat in the counter or from set-plays. After the drama of Saturday\u2019s semi-final, it felt at times slightly anticlimactic, not helped by the curious lack of conspicuous enthusiasm from the Chelsea fans as they squinted into the late-afternoon sunshine.  While Palace\u2019s fans, for whom such occasions remain a novelty, sang and clapped and bounced and waved their flags and balloons in a blur of red and blue, the sense of weary familiarity at the other end was almost palpable: all that fuss about sanctions preventing the sale of tickets and the club didn\u2019t even sell out their allocation. This, of course, is one of the many blights of the superclub era that was ushered in by Roman Abramovich\u2019s takeover in 2003. That what should be events, days that previous generations would have recalled for a lifetime, become dully quotidian to the extent that Chelsea will face Liverpool in both domestic cup finals this season. That the new owners, whoever they may be, might not pump in \u00a31.5bn as Abramovich did, that these days may not be so frequent in future, seems not yet entirely to have sunk in. Wembley has simply become part of Chelsea\u2019s routine to the extent that they have become part of the pattern of Mendy not quite gaining appropriate recognition. Last time they were here, for the League Cup final seven weeks ago, Mendy made a series of fine saves and was probably Chelsea\u2019s man of the match, only for his part in the narrative to be as a supporting actor to another Kepa Arrizabalaga penalty shootout drama (even when he was signed, for a paltry \u00a322m from Rennes, it felt it was largely to be not-Kepa). As Arrizabalaga, who came on for Mendy at the end of extra time, let in 11 out of 11 Liverpool penalties and skied his own kick, the standard line to take seemed to be that taking off Mendy had been a desperate mistake.  Perhaps Chelsea would have won had Mendy stayed on, perhaps his excellence during the game would have had a psychological impact. But the logic that he had just won a penalty shootout with Senegal in the Africa Cup of Nations final seemed flawed. Egypt\u2019s two failures from the spot then were an effort blazed miles over and another scuffed into Mendy\u2019s body. It\u2019s possible Mohamed Abdelmonem and Mohanad Lasheen quailed before Mendy\u2019s presence, but his penalty record suggests few had been so overawed before. Mendy has many qualities as a goalkeeper, but saving penalties is not high on the list. Nevertheless, he has since won another penalty shootout against Egypt, in a World Cup qualifying playoff. That drama, though, will be remembered, if it is remembered at all beyond the two countries involved, for Senegal fans\u2019 industrial use of laser pens shone in the eyes of Mohamed Salah and others before Sadio Man\u00e9 smashed home the winner.  Yet were next month\u2019s FA Cup final against Liverpool to go to a shootout, it seems very unlikely Mendy would again be removed for Arrizabalaga, even though that was a switch that worked in the Uefa Super Cup success against Villarreal. And it may be that the FA Cup final provides his moment. If any Chelsea player is due proper recognition before the uncertainty that follows the Abramovich era takes over, it is Mendy."

                    "body": "  4.57pm    Bye bye! Cheers everyone. Sorry we couldn\u2019t hang longer, but in the enduring words of our (soon to be ex) leader, them\u2019s the breaks. Go well.     4.53pm    Jos Buttler is keen to reflect on how this ODI side goes about filling the Ben Stokes shaped hole. A few names stepped up, mind. \u201cIt is something that we can sit on now and look ahead to what does that look like when Ben is missing from this team and to make sure that we have the World Cup in mind,\u201d Jos said. \u201cThose conditions that we might face in India, what will we need out there and when you have a genuine allrounder like Ben, you are always going to feel short, in either the batting or the bowling. Just for us to have the time to workout which way we want to go and give guys opportunities to stake a claim for that place.\u201d     4.43pm    Keshav Maharaj loved seeing the \u201cold Quinny\u201d The South African skipper lauds his dashing opener who has had his troubles the last 18 months but was sublime today. \u201c He looked really in good touch, pity he couldn\u2019t get the magical three-figure mark. There is a lot of cricket left, and hopefully he can replicate the form. We have found a very good combination, a few players were rested, they will slot in. We just need to be more focused and take the opportunity\u201d He says that we can expect the same faces in the T20 series, though he isn\u2019t captain for that one. That\u2019s David Miller.  Updated at 4.45pm BST    4.40pm    Rassie wins player of the series. The only centurion in the three matches gets the nod from the written press. \u201cWe\u2019re pretty close,\u201d Rassie says of where the team would like to be. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a blueprint.\u201dAnd his role? \u201cBeing adaptable, playing clever cricket.\u201d Easy game then. \u201cIt was pretty hot,\u201d he says of the hottest of hot days in Durham, though downplays the alien conditions. \u201cWe\u2019re used to it,\u201d he says. #Alpha      4.28pm    Series ends all square at 1-1. What a disappointing finish. Just as it seemed as if we were heading to a crescendo in this three-match rubber, with Quinton de Kock still climbing through the gears in a fluent 92* off 76 balls, and with South Africa on 159 for two in the 28th over, the rain fell and never left. There was an earlier rain delay as well, but then the soggy affair has become a blur. South Africa took the first match by 62 runs thanks to a Rassie van der Dussen ton in the Durham heat. England\u2019s bowlers then roared back in Manchester, bundling the Proteas out for 83 in a 118 run triumph. So we arrived in Headingley full of hope. Sadly the cricket gods, those tricksy, conniving scoundrels, had the final say. Thankfully, though, the circus rolls round again in just three days\u2019 time with the first of three T20s in the (fingers crossed, sunnier) south. Bristol, then Cardiff the very next day, before Southampton\u2019s finale on Sunday. I\u2019ll be back with any quotes from players if they arrive. Otherwise, if you don\u2019t hear from me, hope you stay well til the next one.     4.05pm    Match abandoned. Sorry everyone. The news has just come through. That\u2019s that I\u2019m afraid. The game has been called :(      4.02pm    This is adorable but also a timely reminder that this game dolls out harsh lessons to everyone, even the innocent. This little one won\u2019t remember the specifics, but deep in their subconscious a seed of an idea will form and germinate and sprout into the innate truth that we have all come to accept. That cricket is a silly, silly game and infuriates and bores a lot more than it excites and thrills. Rain delays eh....      3.46pm    Let\u2019s not put it past them just yet.       3.41pm    If no play by 6:04 it\u2019s all over. Still plenty of time before then and now.      3.39pm    Apologies Kim. Misspelled your name in the last post. Sorted now.      3.33pm    My name is Daniel, and I endorse this message from Kim Thonger: \u201cGood afternoon Daniel. The 50% refund thing seems eminently fair and I wonder if it might be applied neatly in other walks of life. For example, a government only delivering on half its manifesto commitments might refund half the tax taken from us?\u201d Can I get an amen?  Updated at 3.39pm BST    3.26pm    Heavy sheets have been put in place around the ground. Maybe the ground staff know something. It\u2019s all rather grim.  We might get a 20-ver match at some point. If so, the DLS target would be 175.      3.17pm    50% refunds if there\u2019s no more play, (15.1 overs to 30 overs played, no result is obtained) so says our man Ali Martin. So, if you\u2019re reading this from Headingley (hopefully under cover) there may be a silver lining. Still, would be a shame if this series dribbles to a damp conclusion.      3.10pm    Quinton the soothsayer. How good is this from Quinton de Kock?       3.08pm    Thanks Rob. Howdy folks. What have I missed? Not a whole lot by the looks of things. Still raining up north but perhaps clearing up by 4pm. Let\u2019s wait and see. In the meantime, do get in touch. What\u2019s your preferred time killer during rain delays? I\u2019ve got the F1 on. What are you up to?     3.04pm    It could be a while before we get any more action, so I\u2019m going to walk the dogs and hand over to Daniel Gallan for the rest of the day. Thanks for the baseball education, bye!     2.59pm    According to our friends at Cricinfo, the cutoff time for a 20-over runchase is 6.14pm.     2.53pm    The forecast remains pretty good from 4pm - I promise I\u2019m not being sponsored by the Met Office - so I still think we\u2019ll still get a game today: 33 overs a side, something like that.     2.47pm    \u201cAll you need to know, Rob,\u201d begins Simon McMahon, \u201cis that baseball is essentially rounders for grown-ups who want to behave like children, and cricket, in whatever format, is the greatest game ever invented.\u201d Simon McMahon\u2019s contact details are available to the highest/most affronted bidder.  Updated at 2.48pm BST    2.40pm    \u201cLong-time US reader, never felt the need to holler about the OBO before,\u201d begins Vardibidian, \u201cbut... a baseball player is \u2018on-deck\u2019 for, on average, four or five balls - perhaps as much as three minutes\u2019 time. That doesn\u2019t seem to apply to the next batter up in a cricket match, does it?\u201d In cricket they could be waiting hours, at least in theory. But I don\u2019t know anything about baseball so suspect I am failing to acknowledge something really obvious here.      2.38pm    \u201cI have often thought about Moeen\u2019s ODI record but was recently talking to a friend who works in sports analytics\u2026\u201d says Ed Marsh. \u201cHe said that averages matter most in Tests, least in T20 and to an extent in ODIs. Conversely scoring rates matter least in Tests, most in T20 and to an extent in ODIs. \u201cSo alongside Moeen\u2019s batting average you need to factor in he scores his runs at 99 runs per hundred balls (nearly six an over) and concedes his runs at 5.27 an over. Which for an allrounder (batting at No7 and fifth-choice bowler) probably matter more than pure averages. I guess, though, it relies on him not being required to take too many wickets or score too many runs so he\u2019s best suited to a side with 3/4 batters averaging 40+ and 3/4 bowlers averaging under 30 to be the ideal complementary piece.\u201d Yes, that\u2019s a fair point, though you can\u2019t completely ignore averages or you might end up with a team that looks great on paper and is bowled out inside 30 overs every time. It\u2019s all pretty complicated, particularly with all the data available these days. I just think Moeen has struggled in ODIs in recent years (T20s are different, I like him in that team), and leaving him out halfway through the 2019 World Cup was an important moment.      2.35pm   Rain stops play (II)  27.4 overs: South Africa 159-2 (de Kock 92, Markram 24) The covers are coming on again, so we\u2019ll have a delay and another reduction in overs when the players do get back on. Gah.  Updated at 2.47pm BST    2.34pm    27th over: South Africa 157-2 (de Kock 91, Markram 23) Liam Livingstone replaces Adil Rashid, who has been unusually loose and has figures of 6-0-36-1. The bowling is much of a muchness to de Kock, who pings consecutive deliveries through the covers for four and then two to move into the nineties.     2.29pm    26th over: South Africa 148-2 (de Kock 84, Markram 21) Markram muscles a reverse sweep over backward point off Moeen, with the ball running away for his first boundary. The usual ones and twos make it an excellent over for South Africa, 10 from it.     2.25pm    25th over: South Africa 138-2 (de Kock 81, Markram 13) Another boundary for de Kock, reverse swept past Buttler\u2019s left glove. This has been such a good innings. I can think of only one or two shots that have felt forced or risky, yet he has 81 from 68 balls. \u201cMethinks Mr Porter May have mixed his bunts and bumps up,\u201d says Si B. \u201cBunt is very much derived from baseball. In cricket it\u2019s always been a bump ball.\u201d I knew I should have pulled a sickie today.  Updated at 2.27pm BST    2.22pm    24th over: South Africa 130-2 (de Kock 75, Markram 12) South Africa are manouevring the ball well, as they did in the first ODI at Chester-le-Street. Chuck in de Kock\u2019s stylish boundary-hitting and you have a healthy run rate of around 5.5 per over. He has 75 from 65 balls, Markram 12 from 23.  Updated at 2.22pm BST    2.21pm    23rd over: South Africa 127-2 (de Kock 75, Markram 9) Rashid beats Markram with a delivery that turns a long way past the edge. But de Kock gets another boundary with an accomplished reverse sweep. In other news, I think more rain is on the way. \u201cWhen I was growing up, many years ago, a ball hit into the ground and therefore couldn\u2019t be out caught, was referred to as a \u2018bunt ball\u2019,\u201d says Simon Porter. \u201cI gather \u2018bump ball\u2019 which seems to be coming into modern usage is an import from baseball. I know, pedantic, but standards must be maintained, etc\u2026\u201d Is that right? I\u2019ve only ever known it as \u2018bump ball\u2019. I\u2019m glad I turned up for work today.     2.17pm    22nd over: South Africa 121-2 (de Kock 70, Markram 8) Moeen Ali returns to the attack. We never really question his place in the ODI side, but his record is modest: Moeen averages 25 with the bat, with no half centuries since 2017, and 50 with the ball. A low full toss is pinged towards extra cover by de Kock, where the diving Roy makes a good save. Two from the over.     2.14pm    21st over: South Africa 119-2 (de Kock 69, Markram 7) There was one ball remaining in the 21st over when rain stopped play. Adil Rashid bowls it to Quinton de Kock, who pushes it straight to short midwicket. Next!     2.11pm    Here we go!   Updated at 2.11pm BST    1.48pm    Play will restart at 2.15pm If there are no more interruptions, the match will be 45 overs per side, with England\u2019s target determined by DLS.  Updated at 2.08pm BST    1.30pm    \u201cTo be particularly nerdy, bullpens are usually (now) just outside the outfield fence,\u201d says John Foster. \u201cSo think of someone trotting on from the Nursery Ground at Lord\u2019s. Back in the day, they used to be just outside the first/third base lines (often leading to hilarity/confusion when a foul ball went their way) so like Jofra Archer at the World Cup final. The finest exemplar of the power of the bullpen is here (slightly whiffy language). \u201cIt\u2019s also a cause of much consternation at the mo with the powers that be, given it takes about five minutes to walk in and throw half a dozen warm up pitches on the mound. So it\u2019d fit right in with the ire directed at random drinks breaks etc. Don\u2019t really see how that\u2019d work with cricket, but the on-deck thing for batters is a \u2018home run\u2019! Haha, do you see what I did there?!\u201d A fine email, but I have to pull you up on one thing - in 2022, the phrase \u2018it\u2019s also a cause of much consternation at the mo\u2019 is a tautology.     1.23pm    Inspection at 1.45pm It\u2019s looking a peedie bit better, though I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve seen the last moisture of the day.  Updated at 1.24pm BST    1.16pm    \u201cBaseball bullpens are usually in the outfield under the cheap seats, though with modern stadiums they are a bit all over the place,\u201d writes Simon Piper. \u201cIt\u2019s very quick to get the warmed-up pitcher out into the mound via the anachronistic medium of a cabled phone handset from the dugout.  That\u2019s for the pitchers (bowlers) though.The batters are \u2018on deck\u2019 in a small circle where they swing away with disc weights on their bat (which are cylindrical, so it\u2019s easy to slide them in and off).\u201d     1.13pm    Weatherwatch latest      1.06pm    Remember when (England v South Africa at Headingley department)      1.00pm    Never mind my half-arsed weather forecast, our media editor Jim Waterson is at Headingley.  Your on the ground weather forecast, as I work my way through my mum\u2019s sandwiches on a family day out: fine damp mist of the sort that isn\u2019t really rain but somehow gets right inside your bones and leaves everything a bit soggy. \u201cGrey skies in the direction of Roundhay, childhood home of future prime minister Liz Truss. Nothing is happening here any time soon, even though paradoxically it\u2019s not exactly raining.   Updated at 1.00pm BST    12.58pm    Weather update It doesn\u2019t look great for the next few hours. The forecast is a lot better from around 4pm, so there should still be scope for a shorter game. Start swotting up on DLS.     12.57pm    Interlude This is so good.      12.46pm    \u201cA bullpen would be sensible,\u201d says John Foster, \u201cbut surely even more sensible would be a kind of on-deck circle for the incoming batter in white-ball cricket. Just to feel bat on ball, and get in the groove, and similar cliches, rather than coming in stone cold with a bacon sandwich and few cups of tea weighing heavy in the belly. As a life-long baseball follower, I remain astonished that this hasn\u2019t come into the game yet.\u201d I know the square root of bugger all about baseball - I really need to watch that Ken Burns series - so excuse what may well be a moronic question. Where are the bull-pens in baseball? Would there be any potential issues with people being timed out in cricket? (I\u2019m also not sure how it would work for bowlers, given they have to field, even though I like the idea in theory.)     12.29pm    I\u2019m off for a quick break, but will be back with weather updates as and when. I suspect it\u2019ll be a stop-start game for the next few hours. I\u2019ll leave you with some fairly miserable lunchtime reading.      12.28pm    \u201cBull pen?\u201d sniffs Gary Naylor. \u201cBull er... well, we\u2019re not at the watershed yet. How often did Graeme Swann need a warm-up?\u201d Hmm, I know what you mean, but the excellence of a small group (Jimmy Anderson has tried to abolish the loosener over the past decade) doesn\u2019t invalidate the idea.      12.26pm    The forecast is better from around 4pm, so we should still get a game, if not necessarily a full one.     12.26pm   Rain stops play  20.5 overs: South Africa 119-2 (de Kock 69, Markram 7) Ach, the rain is getting heavier and the umpires have decided to take the players off.   Updated at 1.05pm BST    12.22pm    20th over: South Africa 114-2 (de Kock 68, Markram 5) The speed of de Kock\u2019s scoring means the new batters can afford to take 10-15 balls to get their eye in. Curran\u2019s fourth over is milked for six, none in boundaries.     12.18pm    19th over: South Africa 108-2 (de Kock 64, Markram 3) The crowd get excited when Rashid drops a return catch off Markram, but it was a bump ball. Markram has 3 from 9 balls, de Kock 64 from 59. If you\u2019re just joining us, a) you\u2019re dead to me and b) de Kock is batting delightfully. \u201cClever wicket by Rashid - beat van der Dussen in the flight - but had a shocker in his first over: four long hops and a wide,\u201d says Kevin Mitchell. \u201cCricket needs a bull-pen, as in baseball, for bowlers to warm up. No excuse for that filth at this level.\u201d That\u2019s transported me back to 14 July 2019, and the sight of Jofra Archer turning his arm over by the boundary edge ahead of the Super Over. A bull-pen would have come in handy that day.     12.14pm    18th over: South Africa 104-2 (de Kock 61, Markram 2) It\u2019s raining at Headingley, though it isn\u2019t yet heavy enough for the players to come off. Another decent over from Curran, with the exception of an off-side wide. \u201cI would say Curran\u2019s strongest suit is in one-day cricket,\u201d says Colum Fordham. \u201cHe hasn\u2019t got the speed for Test cricket but his variations are tailor-made for the shorter format and his batting is aggressive too.\u201d     12.11pm    17th over: South Africa 101-2 (de Kock 60, Markram 1) \u201cHi Rob,\u201d says Julian Menz. \u201cI really wish Tanya\u2019s article was open for comments, as I suspect even us club-level cricketers have suffered heat exhaustion at some point, and it is an extremely serious issue. She mentions the protective gear, and spending hours at the batting crease sweating in a helmet in 30C+ is nightmare-inducing. \u201cI realise the obvious differences (footballers run a lot more for one), but the football World Cup has been moved from the Qatar summer. A batter compiling a high score might spend many hours ensconsed in stifling clothing, exposed to the sun. As someone who suffers easily from heatstroke, it never ceases to amaze me how they don\u2019t just pass out.\u201d Sometimes they do.  Updated at 12.12pm BST    12.07pm   WICKET! South Africa 99-2 (van der Dussen c Bairstow b Rashid 26)  The mid-innings wickettaker strikes again. van der Dussen sweeps Rashid straight to deep square leg, where Bairstow takes a simple catch. That\u2019s a useful wicket for England given van der Dussen\u2019s record.      12.04pm    16th over: South Africa 97-1 (de Kock 58, van der Dussen 25) No real movement for Curran, so he is mixing things up. A surprise short ball is eased majestically over Buttler\u2019s head for a one-bounce four by de Kock, a shot that has Mike Atherton citing Brian Lara. There\u2019s no higher praise for a left-hander.     12.00pm    15th over: South Africa 92-1 (de Kock 54, van der Dussen 24) Adil Rashid comes into the attack. He remains a crucial figure, who has taken more ODI wickets than anyone in the world since the 2015 World Cup, but at 34 it does feel like he is slightly on the wane. Don\u2019t ask me who replaces him in the medium term, though England have the 17-year-old leggie Rehan Ahmed with the squad today. de Kock glides his first ball for four and then clatters a filthy delivery to the cover boundary to bring up a high-class fifty from 39 balls. An unusually scruffy start from Rashid includes an off-side wide,. which makes it 11 from the over.  Updated at 12.03pm BST    11.56am    14th over: South Africa 81-1 (de Kock 45, van der Dussen 23) Sam Curran, the player of the match on Friday, replaces Topley (5-0-34-0). Four years on from his England debut, Curran remains a hard cricketer to judge - I\u2019m not sure what his strongest suit is, or his strongest format, or whether he\u2019s actually any good. But I do know that he\u2019s very likeable. His first over is a quiet one, culminating in an unsuccessful appeal for caught behind when van der Dussen misses a hook.     11.52am    13th over: South Africa 78-1 (de Kock 43, van der Dussen 22) Only one wicketkeeper has made more ODI hundreds than de Kock, the phenomenal Kumar Snagakkara. Interesting to see Shai Hope so high on the list. Meanwhile, van der Dussen reverse sweeps Moeen for a couple and then cracks a wide ball to the cover boundary. He has moved in his usual unobtrusive way to 22 from 25 balls.     11.48am    12th over: South Africa 71-1 (de Kock 42, van der Dussen 16) More delightful batting from de Kock, who skims a fullish delivery from Topley past extra cover for four. He has timed the ball exquisitely this morning and already looks a decent bet for his 18th ODI hundred.     11.44am    11th over: South Africa 65-1 (de Kock 37, van der Dussen 16) van der Dussen premeditates a lap for four off Moeen. Buttler knew what was coming and moved across to the leg side, but he ended up running past the ball. The early signs are that South Africa will be looking for a score of at least 300.  Updated at 11.44am BST    11.41am    10th over: South Africa 60-1 (de Kock 36, van der Dussen 12) Topley replaces Willey, and his first ball is timed classily to the cover boundary by de Kock. The placement was immaculate, straight between the men at point and short extra. He opens the face at the last second to glide another boundary to third man, a difficult shot made to look offensively easy. He has raced to 36 from 28 balls. \u201cA childish person might frame this as a battle between Willey and de Kock,\u201d says Matt Dony. \u201cBut we\u2019re above that.\u201d     11.36am    9th over: South Africa 51-1 (de Kock 27, van der Dussen 12) Moeen has his first bowl at de Kock, who times a beautiful drive through extra cover for his fourth boundary. He\u2019s looking good here, ominously so for England.     11.33am    8th over: South Africa 44-1 (de Kock 20, van der Dussen 11) Consecutive boundaries for de Kock off Willey. The first was snicked through the slips after a mow across the line, the second ramped deftly round the corner from well outside off stump.  van der Dussen makes it three boundaries in four balls with an uppish drive through the covers. A good over for South Africa, 13 from it.     11.29am    7th over: South Africa 31-1 (de Kock 12, van der Dussen 7) Moeen Ali is coming into the attack, a brave and interesting move given we\u2019re still in the Powerplay. His second ball is edged through the vacant slip area for four by van der Dussen, who then reverse sweeps a couple of runs to the same area.     11.25am    6th over: South Africa 25-1 (de Kock 12, van der Dussen 1) The new batter is Rassie van der Dussen, the man with the highest average in ODI history (min 20 innings).     11.22am   WICKET! South Africa 24-1 (Malan c Roy b Willey 11)  Malan has struggled to line up Willey this morning, and now he\u2019s gone. He reached for a delivery angled across him, possibly with a scrambled seam, and sliced it straight to Roy at point.  Updated at 11.25am BST    11.20am    5th over: South Africa 24-0 (Malan 11, de Kock 12) de Kock has started well but the right-handed Malan is still getting his eye in. After making 2 from 13 balls, he scrunches a half volley through mid-off for a relieving boundary. He gets another boundary later in the over, walking down the track to slam a short ball over mid-off. Love-15.     11.17am    4th over: South Africa 14-0 (Malan 2, de Kock 11) Too straight from Willey, and de Kock times the first boundary of the day through midwicket.     11.12am    3rd over: South Africa 9-0 (Malan 2, de Kock 6) de Kock is beaten, driving at a tempting awayswinger from Topley. There\u2019s a bit happening for the England bowlers, so Topley continues to pitch the ball up. de Kock leans into a nice push-drive through extra cover and comes back for three.     11.08am    2nd over: South Africa 5-0 (Malan 2, de Kock 3) There\u2019s a hint of swing for David Willey, and Janneman Malan is beaten by the one that doesn\u2019t come back in. Willey starts with a good maiden.     11.04am    1st over: South Africa 5-0 (Malan 2, de Kock 3) Reece Topley has taken 11 for 76 in his last three ODIs, many of them with the new ball. It takes him a few deliveries to find his range, but his last is a jaffa that straightens past the outside edge of Quinton de Kock.  Updated at 11.06am BST    11.00am    The players are out, and the in-form Reece Topley will bowl the first over.     10.47am    Cricket and climate change  This is another terrific piece from Tanya Aldred, who was one of the first, if not the first, to raise awareness of the subject.      10.41am      Updated at 10.50am BST    10.38am    It\u2019s a pleasant, sunny morning in Headingley, which contradicts the forecast. There\u2019s a chance of rain later, although you never really know with these things.      10.35am   Team news  Both teams are unchanged. Next! England Roy, Bairstow, Salt, Root, Buttler (c/wk), Livingstone, Ali, Curran, Willey, Rashid, Topley. South Africa Malan, de Kock (wk), van der Dussen, Markram, Klaasen, Miller, Pretorious, Maharaj (c), Nortje, Ngidi, Shamsi.     10.33am   South Africa win the toss and bat  So much for it being advantage to bowl. Keshav Maharaj says the pitch looks a bit dry, so South Africa want to give their spinners the best chance to take wickets. Jos Buttler says England were \u201ca bit 50/50\u201d but would probably have bowled.     10.05am    Some significant news from Scotland      10.00am    Ali Martin\u2019s preview      10.00am   Preamble  Sunday: the day of rest. And, in English cricket in July 2022, of resolution. For the second consecutive Sunday, England are involved in an ODI series decider. A week ago they bowed to the genius of Rishabh Pant at Old Trafford a week ago; today, they will hope for a better outcome against South Africa at Headingley. Bilateral series tend not to tattoo themselves on the brain - if you don\u2019t believe me, try naming the England XI for the first ODI against the Netherlands last month, and then try listing the Netherlands XI - but they occasionally find a home in the subconscious. This is a quietly important game for an England team who have suffered a crisis of confidence in the last few weeks. In a world where perception increasingly trumps reality, the line between blip and terminal decline can be gossamer-thin. If England lose a third consecutive white-ball series, the end-of-an-era talk will be amplified. But if they win they will feel a whole lot better about their life going into the T20 series on Wednesday.  We haven\u2019t said this too often over the last seven years, but England need more from their batters. They started the ODI summer by almost scoring 500 against the Netherlands; since then they haven\u2019t reached 300. Jos Buttler would also like a bit more luck with the toss. He lost important ones against India at the Oval and South Africa at Chester-le-Street. With a mixed forecast at Headingley, it will surely be a decent advantage to bowl first. The match begins at 11am, with the toss at 10.30am.  Updated at 10.31am BST "

                    "body": "The growing split at the top of golf will widen significantly on Wednesday with the expected confirmation that Henrik Stenson will not captain Europe in the Ryder Cup next year, having accepted a lucrative offer to join the Saudi Arabia-backed LIV tour. Talks between Stenson and Ryder Cup Europe took place on Tuesday. While there has been no comment from Ryder Cup Europe it is understood they are resigned to losing their captain. The 46-year-old Stenson could even feature when LIV stages its third event next week in New Jersey.  Stenson was announced in mid-March as Europe\u2019s successor to P\u00e1draig Harrington, at which point he signed a contractual commitment to the Ryder Cup. That clearly was not compatible with the rebel LIV Series, which has found itself in conflict with the DP World Tour, formerly the European Tour. Yet speculation that Stenson, who would have become Sweden\u2019s first Ryder Cup captain, could be tempted by LIV millions never really went away. LIV now has its man, which will leave Europe seeking a replacement leader for the clash with the US team in Rome in September next year. It remains to be seen what level of backlash Stenson receives for turning his back on the prestigious role, especially in his home country. Luke Donald and Paul Lawrie were in the frame to captain Europe at the time of Stenson\u2019s appointment. It is possible, though, that Europe could return to a past captain such as Thomas Bj\u00f8rn. Sergio Garc\u00eda announced at the weekend that he would be resigning from the DP World Tour, which excludes him from Ryder Cup playing and captaincy roles.  Lee Westwood, Graeme McDowell and Ian Poulter, all veterans of the Ryder Cup with Europe, are already LIV converts. Stenson would say only that his schedule for the year was \u201cundecided\u201d after missing the cut in the Open Championship last week. The winner of the Claret Jug at Royal Troon in 2016, Stenson has slipped to 171st in the world. He is without a mainstream tour win since 2017. LIV has also been heavily linked with Cameron Smith, the new Open champion, and the former Masters champion Hideki Matsuyama."

                    "body": "Hopes that the Queen might have a Royal Ascot winner on Thursday in her platinum jubilee year were dashed as both Reach For The Moon, the odds-on favourite for the Hampton Court Stakes, and Saga, racing in the Britannia Handicap, finished in second. It completed a miserable afternoon for Frankie Dettori after his defeat on Stradivarius, one of the most popular horses in training, in the Gold Cup.\nReach For The Moon had been seen as a potential Derby contender earlier in his career and was backed like a near-certainty to set off at 2-5 against just five opponents. Dettori moved up to challenge Claymore, the leader, at the top of the home straight and briefly drew alongside approaching the furlong pole. His run soon petered out, however, and Adam Kirby got more from Claymore to win by nearly two lengths.\n\nThere is a statue of Dettori near the entrance at Ascot to commemorate the afternoon in 1996 when he rode all seven winners on a single card. His career total of 76 Royal Ascot winners also puts him second only to the late Lester Piggott on the all-time list.\nReach For The Moon\u2019s defeat concluded a three-race sequence that will not feature in any highlight reels, though the rider did very little wrong oneither that horse or Saga, who was forced to come through competitors in a big field and only just failed to get up.\nBut Stradivarius might be a ride that he would like to have again, for all that his defeat behind Kyprios owed much to some canny riding by Ryan Moore, the winner\u2019s jockey.\nMoore was three horses wide coming round the final bend with Stradivarius, already the winner of three Gold Cups, less than a length behind on his inside. Moore asked Kyprios to quicken before coming out of the turn, ensuring as he did so that Dettori would be forced to come around him for a run in Ascot\u2019s short home straight. As it turned out, Dettori also had to go around Mojo Star and, though he made some ground in the final furlong, Stradivarius\u2019s eight-year-old legs had too much to do.\nKyprios, without doubt, is an exceptional young stayer who could well run up a sequence of his own in this race over the next few seasons \u2013 perhaps with Mojo Star, another four-year-old, as a persistent rival. He hit the line running and could well have found more had Stradivarius got alongside.\n\nBut the way the race unfolded left questions hanging, not least as Dettori also ran into traffic problems when Stradivarius finished fourth behind Subjectivist in last year\u2019s Gold Cup.\n\u201cThe younger horses had more legs than me at the end,\u201d Dettori said. \u201cI had every chance to get them, but they were stronger than me.\n\u201c I had to pull out wide and the only place I could go was the outside and everything was getting tight. When I\u2019ve pulled him out plenty of times, usually he\u2019s got the electric turn of foot, but he\u2019s not four any more, he\u2019s eight. I laboured a bit at the end and I was never going to get them.\u201d\n\nJohn Gosden, Stradivarius\u2019s trainer, said he was \u201ca bit surprised from having been in the box seat that we dropped back so far\u201d, adding: \u201cThe problem is when they sprint, you had to come wide to get a run and he had to come widest of all. I just wish we had been a little handier and not had to go through a wall of horses.\u201d\nTactical, the last of three runners in the royal colours on Thursday\u2019s card, finished out of the frame in the concluding Buckingham Palace Stakes Handicap. The Queen\u2019s search for a winner in her 70th year on the throne will continue on Friday when Just Fine, the likely favourite for the Duke Of Edinburgh Stakes at 3.40, is the shortest priced of her three runners on the card."

                    "body": "Ah, the Cup final. All that pomp and ceremony, the classic rites, the time-honoured rituals. The tingle of anticipation as we approach the sacred 4.45pm kick-off. A bespoke set from the world-famous house DJ Pete Tong in the buildup. Banners and placards honouring the competition\u2019s airline sponsor. The traditional taking of the knee. And then, after a peep of Craig Pawson\u2019s whistle, a football match played almost entirely without conventional strikers. One of the greatest misconceptions about the FA Cup over the years is that it has failed to move with the times. In fact, ever since the first final at the Kennington Oval 150 years ago people have been messing around with it, tweaking and tampering and trying new things. It was the first competition to use goal nets and experiment with numbers on shirts; the first to embrace VAR; the first to allow games on a Sunday. Third-place playoffs have come and gone. At its best the FA Cup is not simply a time capsule or historical re-enactment. It can show us who we are and where we\u2019re going.  For J\u00fcrgen Klopp and his formidable Liverpool team, the FA Cup represents a sort of final frontier, a destination as well as a part of the wider journey. Winning the Cup on its own does not make a side great. Klopp, who has made no secret of his competitive priorities over the years, would doubtless argue that the success of his project does not hinge on winning a single 90-minute game of football in the aftermath of a Pete Tong set. But go back through the history of English football and very few of its great coaches did not conquer the competition at some stage. Brian Clough won league titles and European Cups but to his dying day the absence of a Cup final triumph remained one of his great regrets. If Klopp leaves England without an FA Cup winner\u2019s medal, it will gnaw at him: not a lot but persistently and forever. For the club as a whole Saturday\u2019s game is a chance to reignite what has been a curiously casual relationship with the game\u2019s oldest competition. Quick quiz: without looking it up or trying to count them manually, how many FA Cups have Liverpool won? Virtually every fan will know \u2013 instinctively, almost genetically \u2013 about the 19 league titles and the six European Cups. But seven FA Cups (one fewer than Tottenham)? It\u2019s not a shameful record by any stretch of the imagination. But nor is it the sort of thing you put on the side of a bus. The classic Liverpool sides made Wembley their garden. Ian Rush remains the record scorer in FA Cup final history. Bill Shankly ranked the 1965 win as his greatest achievement in management, ahead of the league championship a year earlier. The draining 1989 final against Everton, held weeks after the Hillsborough disaster, felt like a small moment of solace for a grieving city. For all this, and for all the Cardiff heroics of Michael Owen in 2001 and Steven Gerrard in 2006, Liverpool have not won the Cup at Wembley for 30 years. There will never be a better time to scratch that itch. By contrast the FA Cup had filtered into Chelsea\u2019s bloodstream long before a Russian oligarch with a five-day beard clapped eyes on them. Those seven wins between 1997 and 2018 \u2013 achieved under seven managers \u2013 feel somehow pivotal to the mythology of the modern Chelsea, the idea that there is no club in England better at lifting itself for the one-off occasion. This will be their 12th final in the last 26 editions and yet, should Liverpool prevail, they will become the first club ever to lose three in a row.  If it feels a touch perverse to question the killer instinct of Thomas Tuchel\u2019s team, one that has won European and world club championships in the past 12 months, then consider, too, that Chelsea have now lost their past five Wembley finals in all competitions, including a bruising penalty shootout defeat by Liverpool in this season\u2019s Carabao Cup. A fifth season without a league title \u2013 or indeed, a top-two finish \u2013 will be their longest drought since the Ken Bates era. Still under government sanctions, and braced for another summer of disruption and transition, the FA Cup gives Chelsea a chance to anchor themselves in something real, the reassurance that they still are who they say they are. The game itself promises to be a maelstrom. Go back a decade to the last time these clubs met in the final and what strikes you above all is the aura and heft of the two sets of forwards: Didier Drogba and Luis Su\u00e1rez on the pitch, Fernando Torres and Andy Carroll on the bench. This was still an age when clubs looked upon their strikers as their totems, their talisman, their tone-setter. Drogba scored what would turn out to be the decisive goal in a 2-1 victory. The much-maligned Carroll electrified the game\u2019s later stages, cannoning a header off the crossbar that may \u2013 and in those benighted pre-goalline technology days, we would never know for sure \u2013 even have crossed the line. This will feel like a different sort of game, a kind of free-form chaos, a swarm of hybrid attacking midfielders making runs from weird angles and trying to bend defences into unsustainable shapes. Two high lines will grapple fiercely for territorial supremacy. Put two defenders on Mo Salah and you simply create room for Sadio Man\u00e9 to go where he wants. Cling tight to Mason Mount in an attempt to prevent him dictating attacks and you leave a space in behind that Kai Havertz will almost certainly find.  Nothing about this will feel staid or conventional or hidebound. Nothing about this will feel second-string or inessential. At times the FA Cup has seemed to be weighed down by its history, too anchored in nostalgia, too obsessed with the idea of some mythical golden age. But 150 years on from the Wanderers and the Royal Engineers, Liverpool and Chelsea will step out under brilliant Wembley skies: two teams defined by their past, playing football from the future, with their gaze fixed firmly and intently on the present."

                    "body": "The saga is over. Elon Musk has finally bought Twitter after months of to-and-fro marked by legal rows, U-turns and, inevitably, Twitter spats. There will be more drama to come, by virtue of the platform\u2019s centrality to news and politics as well as the unpredictable personality of its new owner. But the months leading up to the deal have been compelling corporate entertainment for bystanders. Here is a timeline of what happened. 4 April \u2013 Elon Musk becomes the biggest shareholder in Twitter as the billionaire reveals that he has accumulated a 9.2% stake, worth nearly $3bn at the time, prompting market speculation that a takeover bid could be in the offing. The Tesla CEO is a prolific user of the platform and had more than 80 million followers in early April (it is now more than 100 million). 5 April \u2013 Twitter announces it is appointing Musk to its board. Parag Agrawal, Twitter\u2019s chief executive, says he is \u201cexcited\u201d by the move, adding that Musk is both a \u201cpassionate believer and intense critic\u201d of the platform. It\u2019s the latter that will come to the fore in the following months. 11 April \u2013 In the first sign that the Elon Musk/Twitter alliance will not be an easy one, Agrawal reveals that Musk will not be joining the board after all, without giving a reason why. It\u2019s the first big U-turn in a story that will contain a few of them. 14 April \u2013 Musk announces an offer to buy Twitter at $54.20 per share, valuing the company at more than $40bn, saying he wants to release its \u201cextraordinary potential\u201d to boost free speech and democracy across the world. 15 April \u2013 In an indication of deep mutual distrust that never entirely goes away, Twitter adopts a \u201cpoison pill\u201d defence against Musk\u2019s bid, designed to stop an unwanted suitor from accumulating a significant stake. 25 April \u2013 After whirlwind talks, and minimal due diligence (which will later turn out to become a significant problem for Musk) a deal is reached for the entrepreneur to buy Twitter for $54.20 per share, or $44bn. In a statement posted to Twitter, Musk says: \u201cFree speech is the bedrock of a functioning democracy, and Twitter is the digital town square where matters vital to the future of humanity are debated.\u201d 5 May \u2013 Musk goes through his contact list and secures more than $7bn in external funding for the deal. Contributors include: Saudi Arabian investor Prince Alwaleed bin Talal; Oracle founder Larry Ellison; Binance, the cryptocurrency exchange; and Qatar Holding, part of the gulf state\u2019s investment fund. 10 May \u2013 Musk says he will reverse Twitter\u2019s ban on Donald Trump, who was removed from the platform in January 2021 in the wake of the Capitol riots. \u201cI think it was a morally bad decision and foolish in the extreme,\u201d says Musk, referring to the ban. 13 May \u2013 Musk starts to get cold feet about the deal and announces that it is \u201ctemporarily on hold\u201d while he awaits details supporting Twitter\u2019s assertion that fewer than 5% of its users were spam or fake accounts. Musk says he remains committed to the acquisition. 16 May \u2013 In an incident that is symbolic of Musk\u2019s behaviour during the deal, the Tesla boss replies to a thread on spam accounts by Twitter\u2019s CEO, Parag Agrawal, with a poo emoji. (Unsurprisingly, the emoji will turn up in Twitter\u2019s filings against Musk a few months later.)  17 May \u2013 The Tesla CEO\u2019s stance hardens, as he states that the deal \u201ccannot move forward\u201d until his concerns about the counting of spam accounts are resolved. 6 June \u2013 Lawyers representing Musk accuse Twitter of committing a \u201cmaterial breach\u201d of his agreement to buy the company by failing to hand over sufficient information about the number of spam users. Arguments like this, which pick over the merger agreement signed by Musk, will form the rationale of the billionaire\u2019s formal attempt to quit the deal the following month. 16 June \u2013 Twitter\u2019s prospective owner meets directly with employees at the company for the first time since agreeing the takeover, focusing on \u201cfreedom of speech\u201d in an online address. Musk also warns that costs at the company exceed revenue, describing it as \u201cnot a great situation\u201d. But he does not directly answer questions about a potential restructuring. 8 July \u2013 Musk announces he is terminating the deal, claiming that Twitter is \u201cin material breach of multiple provisions\u201d of the merger agreement. Twitter, backed by an agreement that does not appear to contain much wiggle room for walking away, says it will take legal action to make Musk buy the company. 12 July \u2013 Twitter lodges a lawsuit in Delaware, where the company is incorporated, demanding that Musk closes the deal on the agreed terms. Some of the language is punchy, describing Musk\u2019s behaviour as a \u201cmodel of bad faith\u201d. 22 July \u2013 Twitter announces a drop in revenue in its quarterly results \u2013 down 1% to $1.2bn in the three months from April to 30 June. It blames the decline on uncertainty generated by the takeover saga and a weak advertising market. 29 July \u2013 Musk countersues Twitter, accusing the company of deliberately miscounting the number of spam accounts on its platform as part of a \u201cscheme\u201d to mislead investors. Twitter\u2019s own lawsuit against Musk is dismissed as \u201cgaudy rhetoric\u201d, as both sides kept up the corporate cat-calling. Twitter describes the suit as a \u201ca story, imagined in an effort to escape a merger agreement that Musk no longer found attractive\u201d. 30 August \u2013 Musk adds accusations from a Twitter whistleblower, Peiter \u201cMudge\u201d Zatko, to his countersuit. Zatko, a former head of security at Twitter, has accused the company of serial failings in its information security set-up. However, legal experts say Zatko\u2019s allegations are probably not enough to tip the legal balance in Musk\u2019s favour. Twitter remains the favourite to win the day in Delaware. 7 September \u2013 Musk fails in an attempt to delay the Delaware trial as a judge rules that the case will go ahead from 17 October. \u201cI am convinced that even four weeks\u2019 delay would risk further harm to Twitter,\u201d writes Kathaleen McCormick, of Delaware\u2019s court of chancery. 29 September \u2013 A Delaware court, as part of the forthcoming trial process, releases text messages between Musk and his closest confidants as he moved to buy Twitter. The messages are revealing. For instance, the podcaster Joe Rogan asked Musk in April whether he would \u201cliberate Twitter from the censorship happy mob\u201d. Musk replied: \u201cI will provide advice, which they may or may not choose to follow.\u201d 4 October \u2013 In a surprise move, Musk offers to buy Twitter after all, on the terms agreed in April. One legal expert said the decision appeared to show that the Tesla CEO was \u201cfinally listening to his lawyers\u201d. It was always the case that Musk was going to struggle to win in Delaware. The announcement comes two days before the billionaire was due to be interviewed under oath by Twitter\u2019s lawyers as part of preparations for the trial. 5 October \u2013 The Delaware judge Kathaleen McCormick declines to postpone the trial, saying no one has asked for hold-up in proceedings yet. 6 October \u2013 Another exchange of mutual contempt between Musk and Twitter, this time via Judge McCormick\u2019s office. Musk asks for a postponement of the trial, with his lawyers saying Twitter \u201cwill not take yes for an answer\u201d. Twitter says Musk was effectively saying \u201cTrust us \u2026 we mean it this time\u201d and demands the trial goes ahead on 17 October. Judge McCormick sided with Musk, giving both sides until 5pm on 28 October to complete the deal. 13 October \u2013 A court filing from the social media company is made public that says Musk is under a federal investigation related to the Twitter takeover. The filing does not say what the focus of the investigation is, or which federal authorities are investigating. 20 October \u2013 The Washington Post reports that Musk told prospective investors that he plans to axe nearly 75% of Twitter\u2019s 7,500 employees if he takes over the company. 26 October \u2013 Musk visits the Twitter headquarters in San Francisco, carrying a sink. The Tesla CEO reportedly tells Twitter employees he doesn\u2019t plan to lay off as many as 75% of the company\u2019s staff. 27 October \u2013 Sources familiar with the matter say Musk has completed the deal. Several of Twitter\u2019s top executives, including the chief executive, Parag Agrawal, reportedly depart. 28 October \u2013 Twitter confirms the deal in a filing to the US financial regulator. The filing says the deal closed the previous day."

Graham Potter\u2019s men, who headed into the World Cup break sitting eighth in the table, will head for the Etihad Stadium as the big guns enter the competition over the weekend of 6-9 January. The Blues have made it to Wembley in each of the last three years, but have ultimately gone down to Arsenal, Leicester and Liverpool respectively. J\u00fcrgen Klopp\u2019s side, who beat Chelsea on penalties last season to lift the trophy for the eighth time, will also launch their defence against top-flight opposition when they welcome struggling Wolves to Anfield. Erik ten Hag will get his first taste of world football\u2019s oldest club competition when Manchester United host Everton, while West Ham make the short trip to Brentford and Southampton travel to Crystal Palace. League One rivals Oxford and Sheffield Wednesday landed plum home ties when they drew Premier League leaders Arsenal and high-flying Newcastle respectively. National League Boreham Wood\u2019s reward for their 2-0 second round win at League One Bristol Rovers was a home tie against League One Accrington, while fifth-tier leaders Wrexham make the trip to Sky Bet Championship Coventry and Chesterfield face West Brom at the Technique Stadium. Dagenham &amp; Redbridge will entertain Premier League Leicester if they can beat League Two Gillingham in a second-round replay, and fourth-tier Stevenage have landed a day out at top-flight Aston Villa. Tottenham host League One Portsmouth, and Brighton travel to Middlesbrough in FA Cup winner Michael Carrick\u2019s first taste of the competition as Boro boss, while Championship counterparts Cardiff host Leeds and Burnley go to Bournemouth. Nottingham Forest and Fulham both face second tier opposition on the road in the shape of Blackpool and Hull respectively. The draw threw up six all-Championship ties between Preston and Huddersfield, Norwich and Blackburn, Luton and Wigan, Bristol City and Swansea, Millwall and Sheffield United and Reading and Watford.

Arsenal would be very convenient for them.      7.03pm    Accrington Stanley\u2019s John Coleman is hanging around in the background, too.      7.03pm    Aldridge\u2019s mic has been turned on for him to praise Jurgen Klopp. Just draw the balls, please.      7.01pm    It\u2019s Mark Wright (ex-Liverpool, not that bloke from Towie who once came on for Crawley) and John Aldridge!      7.01pm    Manish Bhasin is at Anfield for the draw. I was hoping for a cabin outside Oakwell but here we are. There is a small audience being forced to have fun.      6.50pm    Loosely linked to the FA Cup \u2026 Crewe U18s have Pharrell Williams on the bench tonight.      6.49pm    We should probably guess who will be drawing the balls \u2026 I will go with Kelly Smith and Matt Holland.     6.42pm    One person who will not be involved in the FA Cup third round is Mick Beale, who has left Championship QPR for Rangers.       6.39pm    There are a couple of spots undecided for the third round. A 97th-minute Myles Hippolyte equaliser at Charlton earned a replay for Stockport. They will play on 7 December at Edgeley Park \u2013 tickets for \u00a310 for adults.  Dagenham &amp; Redbridge and Gillingham will play for the other spot.      6.33pm    A bit of what happened this weekend in the FA Cup.      6.30pm   The names and numbers in the hat   1.

This evening we will find out about all the potential shocks and upsets that could be coming our way in early 2023. There are no real minnows in the third round this year, which is upsetting. We do, however, get to find out who Boreham Wood, Chesterfield and Wrexham will play. The latter could result in some high-octane links to the Welsh club\u2019s owners.  Anyway, there are loads of numbers in the hat and the draw does not seem to be on the One Show, so things are looking up.   "

                    "body": "Six years ago Liam Marshall, who has now written himself into Wigan folklore, faced an uncertain future. The winger, by his own admission, was hardly pulling up trees in Wigan\u2019s junior setup and the club\u2019s coaching staff were unsure he would make it professionally. How fitting, therefore, that the man who fought his corner to keep him at the club lifted the Challenge Cup as his head coach.\nMatty Peet, who was Marshall\u2019s academy coach back then, had promised he would not consider himself a true Wigan head coach until he won a major trophy. Barely six months on from becoming coach of his home town club, he has ticked that box in the most dramatic way.\n\nWith three minutes to go here, Wigan seemed beaten. Two points behind, they were desperately hurling the ball looking for an opening that was not there.\nBut these games are about clutch moments and how Harry Smith and Marshall delivered. Smith feigned one way, ran the other and produced a pinpoint kick that Marshall raced on to. His pace ensured the rest was a mere formality and, just as he did in the semi-final against St Helens, he secured victory for his side.\nFor a record-extending 20th time, the Challenge Cup is in the possession of rugby league\u2019s most famous club.\n\u201cIt was all about a moment and if I could have picked anyone in that moment, I would have picked Liam Marshall,\u201d Peet said. \u201cI\u2019m just delighted. I\u2019m so happy for everyone. There\u2019s so much character in this group.\u201d\nThe reaction from Huddersfield as Marshall raced in for the winning try told their side of the story. They gave everything in a quest to win their first major trophy for 69 years, but were undone by Marshall\u2019s late try.\n\nThey could look back on the four missed goals from Tui Lolohea as crucial, as well as the loss of their prop Chris Hill in the opening quarter to injury. But they still battled back to lead heading into the final moments before having their hearts broken once again.\n\u201cWigan don\u2019t go away, especially in a game like this,\u201d the beaten coach, Ian Watson, said. \u201cBut this is the start for us, we\u2019ve got to build from here and use this as fuel going forward. The best team lost the final.\u201d\nHuddersfield led for large periods of an engrossing final, including for most of the first half. A penalty from Lolohea put them ahead in the early stages but that was the only goal he would kick.\nHe was unable to convert Ricky Leutele\u2019s try and, shortly after Hill went off, Wigan responded when Morgan Smithies combined with Smith to send the latter across. Smith converted to make it 6-6.\nBut Huddersfield responded well, and the outstanding Chris McQueen, who won the Lance Todd Trophy as man of the match, put the Giants back in front on the stroke of half-time to give them a slender four-point advantage at the interval.\n\nHowever, that lead was erased after the restart when Bevan French and Jai Field linked up to free Field for a wonderful try. Smith\u2019s conversion put the Warriors ahead for the first time.\nLolohea missed a long-range penalty to level the scores but again Huddersfield hit back in impressive fashion. They weathered the Wigan storm and when two of their longest-serving players, Leroy Cudjoe and Jermaine McGillvary, linked up to send McGillvary across, it felt like a poetic ending to Huddersfield\u2019s long wait for a major trophy.\nThat was, however, until Smith\u2019s brilliant kick was collected by Marshall who sent the Wigan support into delirium.\n\nPeet is a keen proponent of psychology and, instead of training on the pitch the day before the final, he had his squad practise their kick-off positions and walking out of the tunnel inside an empty stadium.\nYou could argue that worked given the final outcome but really there is no substitute for talent. Marshall, the latest in a long line of Wigan wingers to solidify his place in the club\u2019s prestigious Challenge Cup history, certainly proved that."

                    "body": "Sergio Garc\u00eda made plain his disquiet with the DP World Tour, formerly known as the European Tour, after his fourth round at the Open. Garc\u00eda\u2019s imminent resignation from this tour will remove him from future Ryder Cups as player, vice-captain or captain.\nThere will be further turmoil for the European Ryder Cup scene if increasing speculation linking Henrik Stenson with the rebel LIV tour comes to fruition. Stenson is Europe\u2019s captain for 2023 in Rome but would be immediately stripped of that title if he aligns himself with LIV. Stenson has repeatedly refused the opportunity to distance himself from a LIV switch.\n\nGarc\u00eda, Europe\u2019s all-time leading Ryder Cup points scorer, said: \u201cI am quite clear about what I am going to do with the European circuit. Probably leave it. Honestly, I want to play where they love me. I like to feel loved and sincerely in the European Tour I don\u2019t feel loved now.\n\u201cI have what I have and I am very happy with it and I want to enjoy it to the fullest. I\u2019ll play less, I\u2019ll be home more. If I don\u2019t play big, then I don\u2019t play them, but honestly I don\u2019t care much either. I feel sorry for the Ryder Cup but because of how I\u2019m playing I wouldn\u2019t be for Ryder either\u2026 my resignation is not official but I\u2019m going to make it effective.\n\u201cThere are comments that do not make you feel good. I have given more than half of my life to the European Tour and feel that because you make a personal and professional decision and look, once for you, they treat you like that, it\u2019s not worth it. And that I was going to continue on the European Tour. There are things that can be done differently. What they are doing is a shame because the European Tour is going to become the fifth [best] in the world.\u201d\nA crowd favourite for the majority of his 25 years on the Tour, Garc\u00eda was an incredibly popular Masters winner in 2017. As a former champion, with LIV golfers unable to accumulate world ranking points to qualify for future major championships, Augusta is the only one he would be guaranteed to play.\n\u201cWhen Thomas Bj\u00f8rn \u2013 former Ryder Cup captain \u2013 came to the BMW Championship and told us: \u2018We don\u2019t love any of you and all players say it,\u2019\u201d Garc\u00eda claimed. \u201cI already have an age and had enough suffering to be enduring nonsense like that.\u201d\nIn response to Garc\u00eda\u2019s comments, Bj\u00f8rn tweeted on Sunday that he had \u201cnever spoken to Sergio about this subject\u201d. Garc\u00eda\u2019s comments have grown increasingly erratic in recent months. He was caught on camera screaming at a rules official during the Wells Fargo Championship in May, saying, \u201cI can\u2019t wait to leave this tour. I can\u2019t wait to get out of here. A couple of more weeks and I won\u2019t have to deal with you any more.\u201d\nWhen asked on Sunday if he enjoyed his four rounds at St Andrews, Garc\u00eda bluntly replied: \u201cNot very much. I enjoyed the crowd, but that was about it.\u201d"

La Liga immediately complained to Uefa over this deal, claiming it was not possible under FFP rules, something PSG deny.\nNeither City nor PSG would comment on the latest claims, but both clubs are known to deny wrongdoing and to hold a scornful opinion of La Liga and its own funding arrangements. Barcelona, whose president, Joan Laporta, on Tuesday called for stricter rules regarding state ownership of football clubs, recently reported a hole of \u20ac500m in its finances but completed a \u20ac55m deal with City for Spain\u2019s Ferran Torres in January.\n\nThe individual complaint against Khelaifi will heighten tension further within Uefa, where he and Tebas are members of the executive committee. La Liga said it was \u201clooking into different representation options due to possible conflicts of interest for Nasser al-Khelaifi arising from his various roles at PSG, Uefa, the European Club Association [ECA] and BeIN Sports\u201d.\nKhelaifi assumed the chair of the ECA after the collapse of the European Super League project last year. Whereas Barcelona, Madrid and City were members of the breakaway league, PSG chose not to join the project. This put the French team on the same side as La Liga, which was a vocal opponent. BeIn Sports holds the rights to a number of European football competitions, including Ligue 1 in the French domestic market. PSG insist that Khelaifi makes no executive decisions on behalf of the broadcaster and that potential conflicts of interest are consistently reviewed by his lawyers.\nPSG and City have previously had FFP investigations by Uefa quashed on appeal. PSG were cleared of breaches in 2019, and a subsequent attempt to reopen the investigation was shut down by the court of arbitration for sport. In July 2020 Cas overturned a two-year Champions League ban imposed on City by Uefa."

                    "body": "Owen Farrell has been cleared to play in England\u2019s Six Nations opener against Scotland next month despite being handed a three-match ban for a dangerous tackle, but his availability may yet hinge on whether he is included by Steve Borthwick when the squad is first named on Monday.\nIn a judgment that again exposes the loopholes and flaws of the Rugby Football Union\u2019s disciplinary system, Farrell was found guilty of a dangerous tackle on Gloucester\u2019s Jack Clement in Saracens\u2019 narrow victory last Friday and initially awarded a six-match mid-range ban. That was reduced to four matches on mitigation \u2013 he was not awarded the full amount due to a previous five-week suspension in September 2020 \u2013 and will be by a further match provided he attends World Rugby\u2019s coaching intervention programme, unofficially known as \u201ctackle school\u201d.\nWhile Farrell would ordinarily be a shoo-in for Borthwick\u2019s first England squad \u2013 and quite possibly captain \u2013 the panel determined that because the squad has not yet been named, the ban should be meted out in club matches. In essence, the panel decided it was not their job to speculate on whether Farrell would be selected by England.\nAt present his ban covers Saracens\u2019 forthcoming Champions Cup games against Lyon and Saracens as well their Premiership fixture against Bristol on 28 January. Players selected in Borthwick\u2019s Six Nations squad would not play for their clubs on that last weekend of January, however, raising serious questions as to whether the Bristol fixture constitutes a \u201cmeaningful\u201d match missed.\nAlso, the panel said if Farrell is selected by Borthwick, his list of matches missed could be altered to include the Calcutta Cup match on 4 February given it is hard to argue Farrell would be missing Saracens\u2019 fixture against Bristol as a result of his suspension when he is in England camp anyway.\nThe counter-argument is that should Farrell be selected by Borthwick on Monday, he could be released from England\u2019s training camp for the Bristol fixture. In reality, banned or not, there would be no chance of him playing in that game.\n\nOn which side of that argument the union\u2019s disciplinary department falls is likely to determine whether Farrell is picked or instead sits out a week\u2019s training so he can face Scotland. The panel\u2019s written judgment read: \u201cShould there be a change of circumstances, then it will be the responsibility of the parties to consider the position and to ensure that the sanction imposed by this panel remains meaningful. If necessary, the player\u2019s free to play date will be amended to ensure the sanction remains meaningful.\u201d\nIf Farrell plays a full part in England\u2019s preparations as well as the Scotland fixture then the RFU, and Borthwick, would be open to widespread criticism. It could be avoided, however, if Borthwick omits Farrell from his squad, he misses the week\u2019s training before 28 January and joins up with England at the start of the Scotland week.\nThen Borthwick would at least have Farrell available for the Calcutta Cup but it would be significant disruption given he missed England\u2019s Jersey camp with a concussion before their autumn internationals campaign began with a defeat by Argentina.\nThe most recent precedent is a two-week ban served by Kyle Sinckler two years ago. Although he was an international player the Six Nations squad had not yet been announced and the panel ruled his ban should apply to Bristol fixtures. He ended up missing Bristol\u2019s match against Bath the weekend before the Six Nations began as well as the fixture against Sale on the same weekend as England\u2019s championship opener against Scotland. Crucially, however, he was not picked in Eddie Jones\u2019s initial Six Nations squad and only added once his ban had expired.\nMeanwhile, in a further headache for Borthwick, Tom Curry has been ruled out for England\u2019s first two matches with a hamstring injury. Curry, who captained England in their opening championship match last year, sustained the injury against Harlequins on Sunday and is targeting the trip to Wales on 25 February. Borthwick is already without the Exeter hooker Luke Cowan-Dickie.\nCurry\u2019s rugby director at Sale, Alex Sanderson, said: \u201cThis is a [grade] 2c hamstring tear, so it wasn\u2019t as bad as originally thought. We got him scanned, assessed and reassessed. A 3c would have been six-eight weeks [out], and he would have been looking to play at the back end of the Six Nations. With it being a 2c and Tom being very diligent on his rehab, it means he could be back for Wales, certainly Wales.\u201d"

FIVER LETTERS \u201cThe news about Eilidh Barbour and others walking out on the awards dinner of the Scottish Football Writers\u2019 Association dinner (yesterday\u2019s News, Bits and Bobs) made me wonder about the SFWA. So I went to its website, where it says this about itself: \u2018If you are a professional football writer then you are eligible to join a body that is always striving for the best working conditions and relationships for journalists.\u2019 Call me crazy, but this sounds like holding up Qatar as a bastion of worker safety or Henry VIII as a promoter of strong marital relationships\u201d \u2013 Peter Rehwaldt. \u201cFred Rutten\u2019s stance regarding Manchester United (yesterday\u2019s Fiver letters) is completely understandable. He\u2019ll be closer to home and have time for grandchildren, without all the stress of the Premier League. One thing I feel may cause some self-reproach though is \u2018when\u2019, possibly not \u2018if\u2019, Erik ten Hag and his technical team are prematurely sacked, and grandpa Freddie frets over how much he would have earned from payouts and not having to work again at all\u201d \u2013 Ahmad Makhlouf. \u201cDeryck Hall (yesterday\u2019s letters) made some valid points about football needing to do more to tackle the climate crisis.

Oleksandr Zinchenko says he invited 10-year-old Ukrainian refugee Andrei to train at Manchester City so that the boy could feel \u201ccarefree\u201d again. \u201cSeventy-five days ago, this boy dreamed of becoming a football player,\u201d said Zinchenko. \u201cToday, he dreams of only one thing \u2013 about peace in our country.\u201d West Ham boss David Moyes wants to prise Ollie Watkins away from $tevie Mbe by slapping \u00a350m down on Aston Villa\u2019s negotiating table for the nifty striker.  Fret not, Leeds fans: manager Jesse Marsch has got a masterplan to avoid a potential date with Wycombe next season. \u201cI have hundreds of quotes I use at different moments,\u201d he tooted. \u201cI use things that resonate with me \u2026 there are historical figures, Gandhi, Mother Teresa, presidents like John F Kennedy.

                    "body": "If several questions remain over England\u2019s progress towards the World Cup next year after a series victory against Australia, that over the future of Eddie Jones has been unequivocally answered. To put it another way, Jones can finally look forward to visiting his elderly mother who, alarmed at speculation over whether he would be sacked, had warned him earlier in the tour to not come home until victory had been secured. \u201cShe\u2019ll be very happy,\u201d Jones said after the series had been wrapped up in Sydney. \u201cI might get a nice sukiyaki from her.\u201d  Certainly a second series win in Australia gives Jones significant breathing space and there are considerable doubts as to whether his employer would have been willing to wield the axe even in the event of three defeats. There are undoubtedly more signs of tangible progress than when the Rugby Football Union made such a claim after another dismal Six Nations and there are platforms upon which Jones can build towards the autumn which, as is becoming a recurring theme, he has already billed as a \u201cmini-World Cup\u201d. Chief among the positives is that there is clearly a togetherness about this squad. Courtney Lawes is an immensely popular leader and if there was a degree of friction when Owen Farrell was stripped of the captaincy they have evidently developed a prosperous working relationship. \u201cWith Courtney\u2019s more laconic style, they have created a great fit at the top,\u201d Jones said. Ellis Genge has developed into an integral part of this team, someone who sets the tone for the side, while Richard Cockerill \u2013 who has seemed back to his usual animated self in Australia \u2013 has forged a formidable pack with a maul that can now be viewed as a serious weapon. The improvements at the breakdown \u2013 with Lawes leading the way \u2013 were evident after difficulties in the opening defeat in Perth, and in both Brisbane and Sydney England were able to close out victories in the face of a fearsome comeback from the Wallabies. If there were defensive frailties early in Sydney, there was a robustness in the closing takes that again speaks to the unity forged within the squad. The emergence of players such as Tommy Freeman and Jack van Poortvliet is a major plus, though it was a disappointing tour for Danny Care, Joe Cokanasiga and Joe Marchant. Equally, there are doubts as to how much progress has been made when you consider the aims of the coaches before departing for Australia. The humiliating defeat by the Barbarians was brushed off by Jones because England were experimenting with new ways to attack but while that continued in the defeat in Perth there was a change of tack in Brisbane and Sydney. Playing a power game based on physicality and abrasiveness is certainly effective but the manner in which England reverted to it suggested an acceptance that developing new attacking methods needed to be put on hold after the first Test loss.  Before the tour the attack coach, Martin Gleeson, said \u201cwe\u2019ll hopefully see the biggest difference in our attack\u201d, on the back of a Six Nations that yielded three tries, the Italy match notwithstanding. For all the talk of promise, of jam tomorrow, demonstrable progress in that sense is thin on the ground. In Perth, they were too lateral, in Brisbane they reverted to a route\u2011one approach, and in Sydney, as Lawes acknowledged, England barely fired a shot. At the heart of the matter is Marcus Smith\u2019s partnership with Farrell in the 10-12 axis. It is probably too early to label Smith and Farrell English rugby\u2019s equivalent of the Lampard-Gerrard conundrum given they have played only four matches together but they are yet to click as a double act. In the first Test, Farrell stepped in at first receiver too often and if that is part of the plan to allow Smith that little bit more space, England ended the series with six tries, two of which were scored when the game was up in Perth. Of the other four, two were from driving mauls, one when Smith seized on a loose ball and only one that displayed an element of creativity. \u201cWith the players we have got we can score loads of tries,\u201d said Smith. \u201cWe have just scratched the surface of that.\u201d In Sydney, there were glimpses, particularly when Smith fizzed a pass to Farrell, who tipped to Jamie George, who released Freeman down the left, but moments such as that were in short supply across the tour. Smith now has 13 caps for England \u2013 \u201cnow out of nappies\u201d, according to Jones \u2013 and adjusting after the honeymoon period of capping Harlequins\u2019 2021 Premiership final triumph with his first two caps and a call-up to the British &amp; Irish Lions tour. \u201cI guess when I started I was a bit naive,\u201d he said. \u201cJust thinking I could do what I did and that has got me in trouble. I have learned from some bad experiences in an England jersey and I am desperate to learn as quickly as I can.\u201d  Jones is stubbornly praiseworthy of the Smith-Farrell partnership but his conviction will be tested if Manu Tuilagi can prove his form and fitness in the autumn while Henry Slade also comes into the equation. Smith would not be the first player to struggle with life in Farrell\u2019s shadow but there is an insistence from within the camp that the partnership will come good. If nothing else, winning the series in Australia has allowed for more time to persevere."

                    "body": "They still play the opening riff to Smoke on the Water by Deep Purple whenever Leicester run out at home. Coincidentally it was released in the first week of May some 49 years ago and it also feels a long time since the Tigers last hosted a more thunderous European knockout fixture. Saturday\u2019s quarter-final against Leinster seems unlikely to involve much peace or love. It takes more than a few pumped-up supporters, clearly, to beat one of Europe\u2019s classiest sides but, equally, there is no question the Premiership leaders quietly fancy their chances inside their own noisily atmospheric lair. Drag the visitors from their comfort zone, hassle them in possession, kick smartly and turn the forward screw and maybe Leicester can dare to dream about making only their second Champions Cup semi\u2011final since 2009. There was certainly no hint of defeatism in the voice of the Tigers captain, Ellis Genge, on the eve of a game which will define how far the club have come under head coach Steve Borthwick\u2019s stewardship. \u201cWe are not plucky losers, we are not that type of team,\u201d muttered Genge this week. \u201cI\u2019m not going to let people build the manifestation of Leinster being the European giants that they are. They have got to come to our backyard. It\u2019s our gaff.\u201d  Never mind if \u201cFortress Mattioli Woods Welford Road\u201d does not exactly trip off the tongue and slightly interferes with the dark, forbidding vibe. As Genge says, this is not a contest for which anyone needs motivating \u2013 \u201cI don\u2019t think games get much bigger than Leinster at home in the European quarter-finals\u201d \u2013 and years of painful exile from Europe\u2019s sharp end is also intensifying local hunger. At this point it is worth recalling last year\u2019s quarter-finals when Leinster flew over to England to play the defending champions Exeter and won 34-22. \u201cThey kept an intensity in the game which meant we never really settled,\u201d lamented Exeter\u2019s Rob Baxter, having seen his side ultimately outdone at the breakdown and physically nullified. There is a significant difference this time: Leinster will not be operating in an echoing, empty ground but, from Genge\u2019s perspective, in one of rugby\u2019s most intimidating cauldrons: \u201cIt\u2019s definitely the best stadium I have played in in terms of atmosphere, hands down. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a brilliant bunch of fans and I hope to see them there en masse because they really are a 16th man or woman for us. There are a few stats you look at that say home advantage is worth a few points. I am not sure many of their boys have had the opportunity to play here. So it\u2019s a good challenge for us, to see where we\u2019re at.\u201d  People were talking in similar terms about England prior to the visit of Ireland to Twickenham in the Six Nations, only for Charlie Ewels\u2019 early red card to facilitate a 32-15 Irish win. On that day, though, the 27-year-old Genge had some scrummaging joy opposite the celebrated Tadhg Furlong and, with Leicester having earned more scrum penalties in Europe this season than anyone else, is again looking to set a no-nonsense tone. \u201cWe came up trumps at the scrum last time at Twickenham but by no means does that mean it is going to happen again. Tadhg is brilliant, he is obviously a British &amp; Irish Lion twice and he is a world-class international. I\u2019ll put my best foot forward and hopefully he meets me in the middle.\u201d Nor does Genge reckon the English were too far short in other areas until their numerical disadvantage ultimately told in the final quarter. No one doubts the quality of Leinster\u2019s Josh van der Flier, Caelan Doris or the sharp young winger Jimmy O\u2019Brien, all shortlisted for EPCR\u2019s player of the season, but in the shape of Genge, Julian Montoya, Jasper Wiese and Tommy Reffell there is an undeniably steely core to Tigers as well. While the visitors, with James Ryan and Ronan Kelleher both starting, will look to pick away at the seams of Leicester\u2019s defensive curtain and retain possession before striking with near-surgical precision, the Tigers will be focussed on disruption. Line speed, lineout homework and aerial pressure will all be key weapons, as will the continuing desire to channel the continuing emotion generated by the recent retirement of their former captain Tom Youngs. Genge and Youngs, in the early days of their relationship, were not natural bedfellows. \u201cOff the pitch we really didn\u2019t see eye to eye on a lot of things. Farmer boy meets city boy \u2026 I was quite chopsy as well and we just didn\u2019t get on too well.\u201d Gradually, though, they came to recognise they shared the same broad objective, namely a mutual willingness to put their bodies on the line for the collective Tiger cause.  That same unflinching esprit de corps is what distinguished the great Leicester sides who won back to back European titles in 2001 and 2002 and poses the biggest barrier to Leinster\u2019s progression this year. In the past two seasons the Irish province have been disconcerted by the power of Saracens and La Rochelle respectively but, like Ireland, they are well marshalled with the ability to push on even further. There is also the small matter of their less stressful build-up, with their senior players not required for recent United Rugby Championship games in South Africa while their Leicester counterparts have mostly had to soldier on through. \u201cThe central contract system over in Ireland is very beneficial for them whereas we obviously don\u2019t have that perk,\u201d observes Genge. \u201cWe have got a lot of minutes in our legs but I think the emotional state of the boys will definitely be enough.\u201d And therein lies the rugged beauty of this intriguing Anglo-Irish summit. Leicester are not yet the finished article but they are fit and efficient. Give them some momentum and they are reliably tough to beat. \u201cIf we do what we have done all year then I think we\u2019re going to be all right,\u201d confirms Genge. \u201cWe\u2019re happy with how we\u2019re progressing but I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve peaked yet.\u201d Crucially, they also love a scrap. \u201cOne thing you know about the Irish boys is they have a lot of dog in them so they will be coming for that battle. We relish opportunities like that.\u201d Time to crank up Ritchie Blackmore\u2019s classic guitar intro \u2013 Daa-Daa-Daah, Daa-Daa-Daa-Daaah! \u2013 to 11 and unleash some hardcore ruck and roll."

I\u2019ll leave you with that and the live blog for Tottenham v Newcastle (Spurs can move within two points of their north London rivals if they win). Thanks for your emails. Bye! \n\n\n\n\n\n 4.11pm  \n\nHere\u2019s Stuart Armstrong, who scored the goal that earned a point for Southampton: \n\nIt was a hard game against a good opposition. It was not the perfect start and we had to defend and try to counter-attack. We changed the shape quite quickly and sat a bit deeper to limit their chances. We knew on the counter we could be dangerous. It was a lovely little slip pass [from Elyounoussi] and thankfully I put it away for my first goal of the season.\n\n\n\n\n 4.04pm  \n\nAlan Pyke is not happy with some of the officiating at St Mary\u2019s: \u201cNormally I detest the level of officiating moaning that greets any Arsenal points dropped, but here it feels like it would be deserved,\u201d he writes. \u201cLyanco threw some light-contact violent-intent manual afters inside the first 10 minutes, plus a throat grab late, and I think there was contact on the headbutt you described as a whiff, all adding up to one yellow. Multiple uncalled (and unreviewed) shirt grab shouts in and around the box from Soton. General chopping at more skilled Arsenal attacking players, only some of it called and none of it generating a yellow for persistent fouling (that one\u2019s still in the rules is it not?). I\u2019m all for the league wide directive to let \u2018em play a bit more this season. This felt like a ref who doubled up on that particular vitamin pill before work today.\u201d I thought Caleta-Car\u2019s hands-on defending was more noticeable than Lyanco\u2019s. \n\n\n\n 4.00pm  \nPremier League full-time scores\n\nAston Villa 4-0 BrentfordLeeds 2-3 FulhamSouthampton 1-1 ArsenalWolves 0-4 Leicester\nJesse Marsch might need to give himself a motivational talk after that defeat at Elleand Road. And what about Leicester and Villa eh? \n\n\n\n 3.56pm  \nFull-time: Southampton 1-1 Arsenal\n\nThat\u2019s a great point for Southampton and three matches unbeaten. Manchester City will be delighted too. Arsenal probably didn\u2019t make enough of their dominance in that first half and they looked a little tired as the second 45 wore on. Saints\u2019 equaliser was a really well worked goal, though, and though it is two dropped points for the Gunners they still stay top by two points. It\u2019s a tough grind before the World Cup.\n\n\n\nUpdated at 4.00pm BST\n\n\n 3.54pm  \n\n90+4 min: This has been a characterful second half from Southampton \u2013 and one that has shown the Saints fans that Hasenh\u00fcttl can still make his team tick. Partey hurls in a long throw \u2026 it\u2019s cleared and there goes the final whistle.\n\nUpdated at 4.04pm BST\n\n\n 3.52pm  \n\n90+ 3 min: Edozie clips a corss to the back post, where Elyounoussi\u2019s header across goal is cleared smartly by Gabriel. Then Lyanco is booked for waving his head close to Nketiah\u2019s in the Darwin Nunez-style. No contact was made but that wasn\u2019t clever. I wouldn\u2019t mess with Lyanco you know. He looks mean. \n\n\n\n 3.50pm  \n\n90+1 min: Tomiyasu floats a ball to the back post where Arsenal have an overload, but Partey\u2019s header back across goal is cleared. \n\n\n\n 3.49pm  \n\n90 min: There will be five more minutes here \u2013 and Arsenal have just win a free-kick 40 yards out. \n\n\n\n 3.48pm  \n\n88 min: Walcott is booked for a dreadful dive near the halfway line when the nearest man to him Gabriel was stood in a different postcode. He\u2019s young. He\u2019ll learn. \n\n\n\n 3.47pm  \n\n87 min: This is one-way traffic now, with Saints very much on top. Edozie looks a player. He\u2019s wriggled away from Arsenal challenges on a few occasions and found the indefatigable Elyounoussi on the right. He\u2019s my player of the match, in case you\u2019re bothered. \n\n\n\n 3.46pm  \n\n86 min: Dark clouds are gathering over Jesse Marsch at Elland Road. Having taken the lead, Leeds now trail 3-1 to Fulham. \u201cIt\u2019s not beyond the realm of possibility that a Fulham win at Elland Road costs Jesse Marsch his job, three days after Steven Gerrard was let go by Aston Villa following their 3-0 loss to the Cottagers,\u201d writes Eric Perterson. \u201cI wonder if such circumstances have ever occurred before in the Premier League, where a team\u2019s consecutive wins have also prompted two managerial sackings on the bounce.\u201d One for the Knowledge! \n\n\n\n 3.44pm  \n\n85 min: \u2026 but it is really well defended by Saliba, who heads away strongly. Southampton are pushing on here. They want three points. \n\n\n\n 3.43pm  \n\n84 min: Southampton win a corner. Che Adams\u2019 eyes light up as Ward-Prose stands over it \u2026\n\n\n\n 3.42pm  \n\n82 min: Odegaard is off and Fabio Vieira is on. Vieira likes a shot doesn\u2019t he? Meanwhile, I should add that I got it wrong earlier. Tierney replaced Ben White not Tomiyasu. Must do better. \n\n\n\n 3.41pm  \n\n81 min: Odegaard slips a clever pass through to Nketiah, whose shot across goal is deflected wide for a corner. The corner is knocked in deep and Southampton clear at the far post. \n\n\n\n 3.39pm  \n\n80 min: Saints goalscorer Stuart Amrstrong has run his last. He\u2019s replaced by the 19-year-old Samuel Edozie, a summer signing from Manchester City. A big 10 minutes for the youngster. \n\n\n\n 3.38pm  \n\n78 min: Odegaard slams home after an energetic run up the left \u2026 but it\u2019s chalked off because Tierney hooked the ball across from just behind the byline. \n\n\n\n 3.37pm  \n\n76 min: Elyounoussi and Tierney clash at the far post and the Arsenal man is left clutching his throat. It\u2019s hard to say what happened but nothing is given and Walcott breaks to the halway line before being closed down and forced backwards. And then someone on the Arsenal bench is shown a yellow card, presumably for some unwelcome effing and jeffing at officials. \n\n\n\n 3.35pm  \n\n75 min: The Southampton crowd are right behind their team now having been so quiet up until the goal. The home side are really feeding off the energy too, closing down fiercely and sensing a fine result is within their grasp.\n\n\n\n 3.33pm  \n\n72 min: Substitution corner! Tierney and Nketiah are on for White and Martinelli, whose hamstrings must be a little tight after all those bursts forward. And Che Adams is on for Aribo, with Adam Armstrong replaced by Theo Walcott, who may finally fulfil his potential if he does something for his first club against his former club here. Adams will be a muscular threat up front for Saints now.\n\nUpdated at 3.42pm BST\n\n\n 3.31pm  \n\n71 min: Arsenal had just started sliding into their comfort zone when Southampton struck. If they can lift their intensity they could very easily win this game and restore that four-point lead. \n\n\n\n 3.29pm  \n\n69 min: The corner results in a scramble and a snap-shot from Aribo that goes straight into the grateful midriff of Ramsdale. \n\n\n\n 3.28pm  \n\n68 min: Another goal at Villa Park, where Olly Watkins has put the home side 4-0 up against Brentford. And Get Him On The Plane\u2019s James Maddison has put Leicester 3-0 up at Wolves. Back at St Mary\u2019s, Southampton win a corner. \n\n\n\n 3.26pm  \n\n67 min: That counter-attack only happened because of a brilliant dummy from Aribo on the halfway line that sent Stuart Armstrong scampering clear before he found Elyounoussi on the right. A good dummy should be worth an assist I reckon. \n\n\n\n 3.25pm  \nGoal! Southampton 1-1 Arsenal (Stuart Armstrong 65)\n\nBlame Ian Copestake Arsenal fans! It\u2019s a lovely counter-attack in which Elyounoussi jinks inside Tomiyasu before dinking a delicious little pass back inside Gabriel for Stuart Armstrong to run on to and fire across Ramsdale and into the corner without breaking stride. Game on!\n\n\nUpdated at 3.28pm BST\n\n\n 3.23pm  \n\n64 min: Caleta-Car has got away with some pretty hands-on grappling with Jesus today. Every time the ball is aimed towards the Brazilian, the Southampton defender has two arms around him. \n\n\n\n 3.22pm  \n\n62 min: Ian Copestake is here, dressed as Captain Buzzkill: \u201cAll this positivity around Arsenal is quite sickening,\u201d he gasps. \u201cIt even renders gloom merchants like the Dony chipper about teams other than his own! The sooner this ends the better.\u201d\n\n\n\n 3.21pm  \n\n61 min: Arsenal appear to be finally wrestling back control of the match, with their midfield pop, pop, popping passes around and keeping possession patiently. They\u2019ve clearly had enough of Southampton\u2019s adventurous bursts forward. \n\n\n\n 3.19pm  \n\n59 min: This is better as a spectacle. Elyounoussi almost scores at one end as a cross falls just out of his reach before racing back to the other end to stop Jesus scoring with a brilliant turn of pace and slide to block the Brazilian\u2019s attempted finish inside the box. Good lungs! \n\n\n\n 3.17pm  \n\n55 min: Nope. But the outswinger from Ward-Prowse does cause mild alarm. From the clearance Stuart Armstrong swings the ball back in from the left and Gabriel and Salisu clash heads as they challenge for the ball. Both seem to be all right after a bit of treatment. \n\n\n\n 3.14pm  \n\n54 min: The energetic Adam Armstrong wins a corner after an industrious foray up the right wing. Can they make anything of it?\n\nUpdated at 3.16pm BST\n\n\n 3.13pm  \n\n51 min: Southampton try to pass their way out from the back and do a decent job of it under intense pressure from Arsenal, with Lyanco winning a throw-in on the right deep inside the Arsenal half. His long throw is cleared after an awkward bounce and then Elyounoussi catches Partey with a late tackle in midfield. \n\n\n\n 3.10pm  \n\n49 min: Saliba plays a horrible square pass towards Gabriel in his own half that Stuart Armstrong pounces on. The forward still has Gabriel to beat, though, and dribbles up towards the edge of the box and then, lacking confidence and support, mis-controls and wastes a fine opportunity. It was like Gabriel tackled him with mind-power alone. \n\n\n\n 3.08pm  \n\n47 min: Martinelli drags the ball back and sends Ward-Prowse air-kicking his way past him near the halfway home. He burst forwards and releases Xhaka on the left, whose cross is blocked to cries of \u201chandball\u201d from the home fans. Replays are inconclusive. \n\n\n\n 3.06pm  \n\n46 min: Perraud has a dig from distance. It\u2019s not pretty. Should go down as a shot though, so it gives the stats bod something to do at least. \n\n\n\n 3.05pm  \nThe second half!\n\n45 min: No changes. Away we go again. \n\n\n\n 3.04pm  \n\nA lot of Floyd fans out there today it seems. \n\nArsenal have been comfortable, Southampton have been comfortably numb. \n\n\n\n 3.02pm  \n\nMatt Dony writes: \u201cI\u2019m convinced Martinelli would be a fantastic Klopp player. But, as much as no one expects Arsenal to keep it up across a season, it does seem like the beginning of something exciting. He\u2019s in a good place, and he could easily become an Arsenal legend. Disappointingly. If only he played for Southampton \u2026\u201d He\u2019s got that blend of skill and incredible energy that makes him an absolute nightmare to play against. If he doesn\u2019t trick his way past you he\u2019ll just run through you and hope the ball follows him. \n\n\n\n 2.54pm  \nPremier League half-time scores\n\nAston Villa 3-0 BrentfordLeeds 1-1 FulhamSouthampton 0-1 ArsenalWolves 0-2 Leicester\nOof! Steven Gerrard\u2019s managerial ability is being savaged by events at Villa Park.\n\n\nUpdated at 2.56pm BST\n\n\n 2.50pm  \nHalf-time: Southampton 0-1 Arsenal\n\nThat was a comfortable half for Arsenal, who will restore their four-point lead over Manchester City at the top of the table as it stands. The only concern is that they should have turned their dominance into more than a 1-0 lead. Mind you, it\u2019s hard to see how Southampton are going to cause Arsenal problems at the back without Che Adams.\nHalf-time reading:\n\n\n\nUpdated at 2.55pm BST\n\n\n 2.48pm  \n\n45 min: Stuart Armstrong scoops a shot at goal but it is well blocked by Gabriel. It followed some lovely play from Aribo, whose dazzling footwork set up Perraud for a pull-back to Armstrong. And that\u2019s half-time. \n\n\n\n 2.46pm  \n\n42 min: Saka and Xhakas combine on the edge of the box, with the Swissn laying the ball off for Jesus, who fires at goal only to see Caleta-Car\u2019s broad chest get in the way. And then he should probably score after being sent through in the penalty area by an outrageous scoop from Odegaard, but the striker fires straight at Bazunu, who has had a fine game in goal for Southampton. To be fair Jesus saw the space between himself and the goal eaten up by the Saints No 1, who was quick off his line. \n\n\n\n 2.42pm  \n\n41 min: \u201cIt seems like the Swiss Arsenal players are enjoying a more than decent Sunday \u2013 first our women\u2019s team captain W\u00e4lti scores, and then Xhaka follows suit. Good times!\u201d cheers Laura Rutishauser. A warning, that Xhaka\u2019s afternoon is not over yet. Always hard to predict how his day\u2019s work will end. \n\n\n\n 2.40pm  \n\n38 min: Martinelli puts on the afterburners and sets the controls for the edge of the box, cutting in from the left and shifting the ball on to his right foot, only to see a low shot deflected wide for a corner. The corner comes to nothing \u2026 but Arsenal come back with Martinelli winning a corner on the other side after a similarly effervescent burst up the left.\n\n\nUpdated at 2.46pm BST\n\n\n 2.38pm  \n\n36 min: Ward-Prowse whips this deep to the back post, but Tomiysau heads clear. Southampton are having a dominant spell but without ever seeming threatening. \n\n\n\n 2.37pm  \n\n35 min: Southampton win another corner. Ward-Prowse drives it low to the near post towards Diallo, but Jesus clears behind for another corner. This one is cleared by Ramsdale but then Stuart Armstrong wins, \u2013 yes, you guessed it \u2013 yet another corner \u2026\n\nUpdated at 2.37pm BST\n\n\n 2.35pm  \n\n34 min: \u2026and from this corner, Xhaka heads away with authority. Southampton are starting to get just a little more belief now. Arsenal have dropped a little too deep in my opinion. \n\n\n\n 2.34pm  \n\n33 min: Ward-Prowse whips it in and Arsenal clear behind. Another corner \u2026\n\n\n\n 2.33pm  \n\n32 min: It\u2019s all become a bit stop-start now. White heads behind after a hopeful Ward-Prowse cross. Corner to Southampton \u2026\n\n\n\n 2.32pm  \n\n28 min: \u2026 with Saka racing clear of Salisu, who catches up with him and kind of shoves him against Caleta-Car. It could be a free-kick but instead the referee Robert Jones books Saka for simulation. It\u2019s an odd one but on another viewing it looks like Saka perhaps tries to leave his right foot out so that it clips Caleta-Car as he falls. I still think a booking is harsh though as he was shoved.\n\n\nUpdated at 2.34pm BST\n\n\n 2.29pm  \n\n27 min: Elyounoussi pirouettes away from Tomiyasu and pops a pass into Stuart Armstrong, but he\u2019s hounded by Arsenal shirts and the Gunners break \u2026\n\n\n\n 2.25pm  \n\n25 min: And just as I start to praise Ward-Prowse, he gives the ball away in midfield, leading to an Odegaard ping forwards to Jesus, who twists and turns in the penalty area before scorching the side-netting with a left-footed strike. \n\n\n\n 2.24pm  \n\n23 min: Southampton are enjoying a decent spell of possession, with Ward-Prowse starting to pull the strings in midfield. From small acorns and all that \u2026\n\n\n\n 2.23pm  \n\n22 min: Score updates! Harvey Barnes has given Leicester a 2-0 lead at Wolves and Rodrigo has put Leeds 1-0 up against Fulham. How Jesse Marsch needs a win. \n\n\n\n 2.22pm  \n\n21 min: A corner for Southampton! Ward-Prowse whips it in right on top of Ramsdale, who does well to punch away under his own crossbar. A Ward-Prowse set piece might be Southampton\u2019s biggest threat today. \n\n\n\n 2.21pm  \n\n19 min: Diallo shows great composure to swivel away from a swarm of Arsenal midfielders and release the onrushing Ward-Prowse but a promising counter-attack slows down when Aribo cuts back inside and goes backwards. \n\n\n\n 2.19pm  \n\n18 min: Meanwhile at Villa Park, Danny Ings has scored again to given his side a 3-0 lead over Brentford after just 18 minutes. How Southampton must miss Ings. Give it Danksy?\n\n\nUpdated at 2.23pm BST\n\n\n 2.18pm  \n\n17 min: Southampton can\u2019t get out of their half. Arsenal look like they have a couple more gears to move through, too. \n\n\n\n 2.16pm  \n\n16 min: \u201cEvery time I start thinking that Arsenal might win the title, I start feeling like the old man in the Bruce Springsteen song Reason to Believe, poking a dead dog with a stick hoping it\u2019ll spring to life,\u201d writes K\u00e1ri Tulinius. \u201cBut still, as the chorus kinda says, with every Xhaka goal Arsenal fans find some reason to believe.\u201d\n\n\n\n 2.15pm  \n\n15 min: Arsenal have sat back a little since scoring and seem content to let Southampton have the ball, mainly because the Saints don\u2019t seem to know what to do with it in possession. \n\n\n\n 2.14pm  \n\n13 min: And so are Aston Villa, who are the latest club to enjoy a No Manager Bounce. Danny Ings has given them a 2-0 lead over Brentford. Caretaker manager Aaron Danks has very much located Steven Gerrard\u2019s handbrake and taken it off.\n\n\nUpdated at 2.21pm BST\n\n\n 2.12pm  \nGoal! Southampton 0-1 Arsenal (Xhaka 11)\n\nWhat a finish! White is sent scuttling down the right wing by Saka before picking out Xhaka with a delightful clipped cross towards the penalty spot, where the midfielder thunders home on the half-volley with his right foot. Lovely stuff. Arsenal are purring.\n\n\nUpdated at 2.19pm BST\n\n\n 2.10pm  \n\n9 min: Martinelli waltzes up the left, cuts the ball inside to Xhaka who, in turn, lays it on a plate for Odegaard on the edge of the box. The Arsenal captain should at least test Bazunu but drags a tame shot wide with his left foot. The Gunners are all over this game like an attractive rash. \n\n\n\n 2.08pm  \n\n7 min: Xhaka lashes a shot straight at Bazunu, who makes a Pat Jennings-style save with his legs (ask your parents, kids). It followed some lovely one-touch passing between Martinelli and Jesus, who have struck up a fine understanding in little time at Arsenal. \n\n\n\n 2.07pm  \n\n6 min: Lyanco has a pop from distance but it\u2019s a comfortable save for Ramsdale. Meanwhile, Aston Villa are 1-0 up against Brentford already. Leon Bailey the scorer.\n\n\nUpdated at 2.13pm BST\n\n\n 2.05pm  \n\n4 min: Xhaka floats it over to the right, where Saka takes a feather-toed touch, drops his shoulder and whips a \u201ccome and head me inswinger\u201d into the six-yard box that Jesus can\u2019t quite reach. That was a delicious cross. \n\n\n\n 2.03pm  \n\n3 min: Caletar-Car shunts Jesus from behind in the muscular fashion to give Arsenal a free-kick midway inside the Saints half. Xhaka to take it \u2026 \n\n\n\n 2.02pm  \n\n2 min: Jesus brings a save out of Bazunu immediately after some fine work down the left \u2026 but the striker is rightly flagged for offside. A sharp start from the Gunners though. \n\n\n\n 2.00pm  \nKick-off!\n\n1 min: Peep! Arsenal get the match under way. They\u2019re kicking from left to right on my TV. Southampton going the other way. So build a picture of that in your minds if you will. \n\n\n\n 1.59pm  \n\nThe teams are out at St Mary\u2019s on what has ended up being a lovely day for football after the torrential showers earlier. Southampton wear their white shirts with a single red stripe down the middle (that\u2019s not a Southampton kit for me \u2013 where are the stripes?) while Arsenal wear all black. Here we go!\n\nUpdated at 2.27pm BST\n\n\n 1.54pm  \n\nThere are three other 2pm kick-offs in the Premier League this afternoon: Aston Villa v Brentford, Leeds v Fulham and Wolves v Leicester. There are some struggling clubs in action there with Villa and Wolves having already sacked their managers and the pressure very much on Leeds\u2019 Jesse Marsch and Leicester\u2019s Brendan Rodgers. You can follow the goals with our live scores page, here. \n\n\n\n 1.49pm  \n\nAn anonymous Arsenal fan writes: \u201cIt\u2019s a cautious optimism. Very cautious. We all remember how things fell apart so painfully last year when we were only chasing fourth place. Terrible defeats at Newcastle and Spurs and the old failings were exposed. Now, we have a great first XI but a single injury in a key place \u2013 Jesus, Saka, Xhaka, Martinelli, Saliba, etc \u2013 could cause major issues; whereas the City squad has at least two high quality players in almost every position. It\u2019s a long, long season and who knows how the World Cup break will affect momentum, injuries, approach, mentalities \u2026\u201d\n\n\n\n 1.46pm  \nFootball is for everyone\n\nBefore kick-off, a reminder that all weekend Premier League captains are wearing rainbow armbands as part of the Premier League\u2019s commitment to supporting LGBTQ+ inclusion. \n\n\n\n\n 1.43pm  \n\nRalph Hasenh\u00fcttl speaks:\n\nWe know what we are facing today. Top of the table \u2026 we need to have a good performance. Che Adams has a hamstring problem and is not fully fit, we are not taking a risk as we do not want to lose him. It will not be about the shape today it will be about what we deliver on the pitch. We need to show a lot of passion at home, lots of sprinting lots of running and finding a way of defending, commitment, solutions. There is not much difference to last time [when Southampton won 1-0 in April] but we did everything right [on that day].\n\n\n\n\n 1.34pm  \n\nMost Arsenal fans I have spoken to have been reluctant to say they are in a title race yet. Even now when they have dropped only three points from 30. Surely the race is very much on now, no? I understand that Erling Haaland is ridiculous but surely the consistency Arteta spoke of is making some of you believe \u2026 just a little bit?\n\n\nUpdated at 1.42pm BST\n\n\n 1.21pm  \n\n\u201cAfternoon Gregg,\u201d writes Dean Kinsella. \u201cI know the Saints are in need of goals and Adams is a big loss but arguably, Walker-Peters is the biggest loss today. He has been in splendid form of late.\u201d\nHe really is, Dean. His battle against Gabriel Martinelli would have been a cracking one today. He was starting to put himself in the England picture too, given the issues Gareth Southgate has at right-back.\n\nUpdated at 1.23pm BST\n\n\n 1.17pm  \n\nA very relaxed-looking Mikel Arteta has just been out on the pitch at St Mary\u2019s for a quick word with Sky. Here\u2019s what he had to say: \nWhy are Arsenal doing so well? \u201cIt\u2019s about the consistency, individually and collectively and doing all the basics right and always doing your best. We must always have the willingness to improve.\u201d \nWhat\u2019s the difference between the Arsenal team that lost at Southampton in April and this one? \u201cThe environment and the energy around the team is positive. Last year they made it difficult and we will have to deal with it again. The schedule we have [means we] have to prepare our players mentally and physically for the fixtures. Every team has a strength and weakness and we will try to exploit them,\u201d he adds when asked about Walker-Peters\u2019 absence. \n\n\n\n 1.10pm  \nTeam news\n\nSouthampton: Bazunu, Caleta-Car, Lyanco, Salisu, Perraud,Diallo, Ward-Prowse, Elyounoussi, Aribo, Stuart Armstrong,Adam Armstrong. Subs: McCarthy, Adams, Mara, Djenepo, Edozie,Larios, Walcott, Payne, Finnigan.\nArsenal: Ramsdale, White, Saliba, Gabriel, Tomiyasu, Partey,Xhaka, Saka, Odegaard, Martinelli, Gabriel Jesus. Subs: Tierney,Nketiah, Holding, Cedric, Vieira, Sambi Lokonga, Nelson,Alencar, Turner.\nReferee: Robert Jones (Merseyside)\nThe bad news for Southampton is that Che Adams is only fit enough to make the bench after struggling with a tight hamstring. Meanwhile, Arsenal are unchanged from Leeds and look supremely strong.\n\nUpdated at 1.24pm BST\n\n\n 1.00pm  \nPreamble\n\nAfternoon! It\u2019s a mark of how good Arsenal have been this season that they can afford to slip up at Southampton today and still stay top of the table. Mikel Arteta has built an energetic and flexible team, capable of winning matches in various ways. Following the pulsating win over Liverpool at the Emirates \u2013which very much felt like New Arsenal \u2013 they stuck at their job and won by that most Old Arsenal of scorelines at Leeds to pull four points clear. \u201cWe found a way to win,\u201d said Arteta. They certainly did and that ability is helping them put up big numbers \u2013 they\u2019re enjoying their best start to a season in 118 years \u2013 and, who knows, maybe if they can keep their noses in front until the World Cup, the extended break might just help them. Going toe to toe with Manchester City is a mentally exhausting business and the Premier League hiatus for Qatar could be a welcome reset. Here\u2019s how the top of the table looks before kick-off. Nice eh, Gunners? \n\nAs for Southampton, Ralph Hasenh\u00fcttl stopped the rot \u2013 and quite possibly saved his job \u2013 by following four defeats in a row with a draw against West Ham and a 1-0 win at Bournemouth. Arsenal are a cut above both those sides, though, and the hosts could be in for a long afternoon. Only Che Adams offers any threat in attack and without his five goals so far this season Saints could be in the relegation zone. Hasenh\u00fcttl is without the marauding right-back Kyle Walker-Peters, who has pulled a hamstring, and also the on-loan Ainsley Maitland-Niles, who is unable to play against his parent club. James Ward-Prowse hasn\u2019t scored one of his free-kicks in a while, either. How Saints could do with him chipping in today.\n\n"

                    "body": "If Estonia had not conceded five goals to Lionel Messi this month, India\u2019s legendary striker Sunil Chhetri would be second behind Cristiano Ronaldo in the highest active international goalscorers\u2019 list. The 37-year-old has 84, two behind the Argentinian, after scoring four in the just-finished third round of qualification for the 2023 Asian Cup. That haul helped India win all three games and stroll to a second successive appearance at the continent\u2019s biggest event. Chhetri is a little concerned, however, that he may not be able to participate in the tournament \u2013 and not because there is currently no host after China relinquished those duties last month. The worry is that India may be hit with a Fifa ban. \u201cI hope everything will come out as good for the sport and the country does not get a ban,\u201d Chhetri said this month. \u201cThe ban will be catastrophic not just for the whole country but for me, because I\u2019m 37. You never know when there\u2019s the last game for you.\u201d After the captain said his piece, the national team coach, Igor Stimac, told those running the game in the country of 1.4 billion to \u201cwake up\u201d.  Although the national team are becoming regulars at the continental competition, the All India Football Federation (AIFF) has been in turmoil. Praful Patel replaced Priya Ranjan Dasmunsi, who had been in charge since 1988 but ended his tenure bed-ridden, as president in 2008. The rise of Patel, a Fifa Council member and Asian Football Confederation vice-president, in the football world has been smoother than India\u2019s. During his tenure, the fortunes of the various national teams have fluctuated, facilities have improved but the domestic game is in flux because of restructuring, and the AIFF\u2019s signing of a 15-year commercial deal with Reliance in 2010 is still a controversial subject. In March the sports ministry gave its verdict and reduced its funding of the federation by 85% for 2022-23 compared with the 2019-20 figure, with reports suggesting it was due to the poor performance of the national team, disappointment at the performances of various age-level sides and concerns over women\u2019s football. The AIFF was advised to focus on the grassroots. The supreme court was told to sort out the federation\u2019s election situation. This spelled the end of Patel\u2019s tenure. His third term, the maximum allowed, finished in December 2020 but a new election, in which he would not be able to stand, was not held (according to Patel there was a constitutional issue that had to be sorted first) and he stayed in place. The court appointed a three-man committee of administrators (CoA) to take charge. It was originally hoped that new elections could be held by the end of June. Now the talk is of September.  Fifa may have something to say about that. Other Asian nations such as Kuwait and Indonesia have been hit with bans in recent years for what the governing body saw as government interference in the running of the federation. Officials are visiting India on Monday to check out what has been going on. \u201cI don\u2019t think Fifa would have an objection to this development,\u201d said Dr SY Quraishi, one of the three administrators. \u201cFootball elections were long overdue, the erstwhile team had stayed on past its tenure and elections were necessary. I don\u2019t see a noncompliance issue with Fifa here. We hope that Fifa will understand and cooperate and we will cooperate with them as we try to finish this task given to us by the court.\u201d In 2018, Pakistan\u2019s supreme court ordered football federation elections that were won by Ashfaq Hussain. His victory was never recognised by Fifa and he led a group that stormed the Pakistan federation\u2019s headquarters in Lahore in March 2021, throwing out Fifa\u2019s normalisation committee. The chaos remains, as does the ban. India is different to Pakistan, which is a country that loves the game but has almost fallen off Asian football\u2019s radar with self-interested leaders and a national team who have played seven games in seven years and none since 2019. Fifa has given a lot more attention to India, with Gianni Infantino, like Sepp Blatter before, a regular visitor to New Delhi, and it has provided more investment.  The country staged the 2017 under-17 men\u2019s World Cup and will do the same for the women in October. The 2022 Women\u2019s Asian Cup took place in January and despite a slightly embarrassing start when the host team had to withdraw after Covid breached their bubble, it went pretty well in the end and the final, with China edging out South Korea, was a thriller. India has bid to host the men\u2019s 2027 Asian Cup, the continent\u2019s biggest football competition. Staging that tournament at some point is seen as a necessary step on the road to the World Cup coming to the subcontinent. Recent events are a blow to Indian prestige but would be nothing compared with a Fifa ban. Such an outcome is unlikely but nobody wants the situation to drag. With major reforms taking place in domestic competitions and a decision over the 2027 Asian Cup venue coming soon, now is the time for those in charge to do what coach Stimac says and \u201cwake up\u201d, otherwise the only winner in the whole situation may well be Lionel Messi."

                    "body": "The Chinese president Xi Jinping is expected to visit Saudi Arabia next week, where plans are under way for a gala reception to match that given to Donald Trump on his first trip abroad as president. The welcome being prepared for the Chinese leader is in stark contrast with that afforded to Joe Biden in June, when the US president received a low-key reception, reflecting strained ties between the two countries and personal distaste between Biden and the de facto Saudi leader, Mohammed bin Salman. Xi, however, is instead expected to receive a bells-and-whistles welcome intended to consolidate ties between Beijing and Riyadh and reinforce the image of China as an ally of Saudi Arabia, as ties with Washington continue to drift. China and Saudi Arabia have been growing closer over two decades, but ties have deepened as Prince Mohammed accumulated power in the kingdom from 2016 onwards. Riyadh has defended China\u2019s treatment of its Uyghur Muslim minority and Hong Kong\u2019s draconian national security law, placing it at odds with the US on key human rights issues. Trade ties between the two countries have forged ahead at the same time as Washington has pivoted away from the Middle East. \u201cChina is Saudi Arabia\u2019s largest trade partner. It is the largest buyer of Saudi oil,\u201d said Mohammed Alyahya, a fellow at the Harvard Belfer Center\u2019s Middle East Institute and senior fellow at the Hudson Institute. \u201cChina is very important in the region geopolitically. It has been eyeing military bases in Africa and elsewhere. In the past its interests had been purely mercantilist, focused entirely on commerce. Now they\u2019re increasingly looking at things through a strategic lens. \u201cThey are particularly interested in ensuring the free flow of oil. This is the same for China as the US. The Americans say there is a diversion of bandwidth away from the region to focus on countering China in a \u201cpivot to Asia\u201d. The Chinese however seem to consider the region to be a primary theatre for great power competition. \u201cChina is America\u2019s primary competitor in the region. They\u2019ll clearly be watching very carefully.\u201d Xi was first invited to Riyadh in March. His visit is likely to be the most significant to the kingdom since Trump\u2019s arrival in May 2017, months after his inauguration, where he was received with silver swords, a glowing orb, extravagant gifts and a rollout of Saudi and Arab royalty.  That visit set the tone for the Trump administration\u2019s disposition towards Riyadh, an era when the ambitious crown prince was given repeated cover by Trump and his senior officials and formed deep ties with Trump\u2019s son-in-law, Jared Kushner. China made no public comment about Saudi Arabia\u2019s invasion of Yemen, its boycott of Qatar, or the murder of dissident, Jamal Khashoggi, which led to strong condemnation in the US and Europe. China is increasingly seen as stepping into a regional vacuum created by waning US interest and power projection. Biden\u2019s June visit yielded few dividends, and did not succeed in convincing Prince Mohammed to boost oil supplies \u2013 a move that would have helped reduce bowser prices in the US in the run-up to mid-term elections. In preparation for the visit, which is expected to take in Riyadh, Jeddah and the planned megacity of Neom on the western Saudi coast, plans were under way to hoist thousands of Chinese banners and receive hundreds of dignitaries. Prince Mohammed has appeared emboldened by Biden\u2019s visit, telling allies that it succeeded in reasserting Riyadh\u2019s influence on a global stage, and displaying a sovereign footing. Critics of the visit have claimed that the US helped rehabilitate Prince Mohammed nearly four years after the Khashoggi killing \u2013 which was carried out by Prince Mohammed\u2019s security aides \u2013 while receiving little in return. \u201cSaudi has its swagger back,\u201d said one senior Saudi official. \u201cWe engage with our friends on equal terms. Friends don\u2019t just arrive here, demand things and give nothing back.\u201d Prince Mohammed recently travelled to Greece and France, ending years of isolation. \u201cThat visit was made possible by the Biden visit,\u201d said the Saudi official. \u2022 This article was amended on 11 August 2022 to add the word \u201cexpected\u201d to the headline and first paragraph."

                    "body": "The war in Ukraine risks putting global targets on the climate out of reach, the UN secretary general has warned, if countries respond to Russia\u2019s aggression by increasing their use of fossil fuels. Ant\u00f3nio Guterres said the aim of limiting global temperatures to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels, the goal set out at the Cop26 UN climate summit last year, was in peril as countries sought alternatives to Russian oil and gas supplies. \u201cThe fallout from Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine risks upending global food and energy markets, with major implications for the global climate agenda. As major economies pursue an \u2018all-of-the-above\u2019 strategy to replace Russian fossil fuels, short-term measures might create long-term fossil fuel dependence and close the window to 1.5C,\u201d he warned, in a video address to a conference on sustainability run by the Economist newspaper in London on Monday. \u201cCountries could become so consumed by the immediate fossil fuel supply gap that they neglect or knee-cap policies to cut fossil fuel use,\u201d he went on. \u201cThis is madness. Addiction to fossil fuels is mutually assured destruction.\u201d Europe is dependent on Russia for 40% of its gas, with Germany\u2019s reliance even higher at 60%. The EU is embarking on a plan to cut its use of Russian gas by two-thirds this year, and eliminate it in future years. As part of that plan, as well as expanding renewable energy generation, EU member states are seeking fossil fuels from other nations, such as gas from Qatar and oil from Saudi Arabia. Some may also consider an increase in coal-fired power generation. Faced with high petrol prices, the US is also seeking to expand its imports of oil, even considering countries previously regarded as pariah states, such as Venezuela and Iran. Domestic US oil and gas production from fracking and drilling is also set to ramp up. Around the world, oil and gas companies see a bonanza from the ongoing crisis, driven by first the rebound after Covid-19 and now by countries moving imports away from Russia. In the UK the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, is considering a cut in fuel duty, to offset some of the price increases that have taken petrol near record highs. Critics warned such a cut would have little impact on poorer households.  Guterres said turning to fossil fuels would only store up further problems. \u201cAs current events make all too clear, our continuing reliance on fossil fuels puts the global economy and energy security at the mercy of geopolitical shocks and crises,\u201d he said. \u201cInstead of hitting the brakes on the decarbonisation of the global economy, now is the time to put the pedal to the metal towards a renewable energy future.\u201d The UN secretary general acknowledged widespread concern among climate experts that the progress on display at the Cop26 summit was in danger of dissipating under the pressure of soaring energy prices and greenhouse gas emissions. The International Energy Agency found that annual carbon dioxide emissions from energy jumped by 6% last year to their highest levels in history, as economies rebounded from the Covid-19 pandemic. The \u201cgreen recovery\u201d that many governments promised from the crisis has not materialised. Guterres warned: \u201cIf we continue with more of the same, we can kiss 1.5C goodbye. Even 2C may be out of reach. That would be catastrophe.\u201d"

                    "body": "Meera Stephen came to Britain with a big suitcase and even bigger dreams. The 27-year-old had left Kerala in south India to work at a care home in Manchester, one of thousands of migrant workers to come after a government recruitment drive to fill more than 100,000 vacancies in social care. The job would pay \u00a310 an hour \u2013 just above minimum wage. But it came at a price. In exchange for securing her employment, she would pay a recruitment agent 1.3m rupees \u2013 about \u00a313,700. Stephen, whose name has been changed to protect her, is one of a growing number of migrant workers being charged to work in Britain\u2019s care sector. Requiring workers to pay recruitment fees for finding or trying to find them jobs is illegal in the UK and breaches international labour standards. The practice has previously been exposed in Dubai and the Gulf \u2013 most recently with migrant labourers employed on World Cup-related projects in Qatar \u2013 and is considered a human rights abuse that leaves workers vulnerable to exploitation. But an Observer investigation has uncovered a booming industry of recruitment agencies supplying workers to care homes and domiciliary care firms across Britain that pass recruitment costs on to candidates. Workers from countries including India, the Philippines, Ghana and Zimbabwe \u2013 many of whom arrived via a new visa scheme for care workers launched in February \u2013 report being charged between \u00a32,000 and \u00a318,000 in illegal fees. Most cannot speak publicly because their visas are tied to their employers. But testimony from 10 workers, interviews with charities and labour experts and analysis of payslips, contracts and online chat groups for workers reveals the practice is widespread, with dozens of agencies believed to be charging the fees. The recruiters appear to target workers in lower-income countries, particularly in Asia and Africa, enticing candidates with promises of good jobs or a \u201cdream life\u201d in the UK via social media and word of mouth. The official visa application fee for individuals is \u00a3247, with costs associated with recruitment supposed to be borne by the employer.\u200b But in one exchange with an undercover reporter last week, an agency based in India that supplies workers to care homes in Britain said the \u201cservice charge\u201d to candidates for arranging a \u00a310-an-hour job would be 1.7m rupees, about \u00a317,800. The agency said \u00a31,500 would be payable before the interview, \u00a34,000 on receipt of an offer letter and \u00a33,500 after the issue of a visa, with the remainder collected after arrival in the UK. Another firm said on its website that applicants would have to \u201cpay an agency fee for finding you the job\u201d. The UK-registered agency quoted \u00a34,500 for a \u201cplacement package\u201d including a certificate of sponsorship, a cost normally borne by the employer, and \u201cvisa application support\u201d \u2013 something only lawyers and registered immigration advisers can legally charge for.  A third agency, which we are not naming to protect the victims\u2019 identities, demanded a \u00a34,000 fee from a worker for securing them a \u00a310.10-an-hour healthcare assistant position at a nursing home for elderly residents in the south-east. In an offer letter sent to the worker, seen by the Observer, the UK-based firm said the fee \u2013 equivalent to more than two months\u2019 full pay \u2013 was to \u201ccover the cost of the processing of the certificate of sponsorship\u201d. The fees are likely to be illegal and fit the International Labour Organization\u2019s definition of prohibited fees, which include \u201cany costs incurred in the recruitment process in order for workers to secure employment or placement, regardless of the manner, timing or location of their imposition or collection\u201d. Care workers have become trapped in debt bondage \u2013 a form of modern slavery \u2013 as a result of being made to pay the fees. Suspected victims described how agents had deducted money from their salaries and withheld their passport or residence permit until they repaid the debt.  Meera Stephen said she was expected to work \u201cday and night\u201d while working to pay off what she owed. Before coming to the UK she had borrowed from friends to cover initial costs but still owes \u00a33,700. She says the agent is holding her biometric residence permit \u2013 proof of her immigration status \u2013 until the fee is paid. Others claim to have been misled about their working conditions, paid less than minimum wage and subjected to threats and abuse. In one case, a woman was told she would be working in Birmingham but was sent to rural Wales. Her visa was tied to that employer. \u201cThere is no car, no bus. She is living in the home. They sold their property in India to come here. How will they go back?\u201d said Joe Joseph, a campaigner from Kerala who has posted on social media about the recruitment charges. \u201cPeople are afraid. If they raise their voice they are going to be terminated.\u201d Contracts that tie workers to their jobs can make it even harder for some to leave their roles. The repayment clauses are commonly used in the private care sector, as well as by some NHS trusts, and stipulate that workers will pay a fee if they leave before their agreed contract terms ends \u2013 usually two or three years. John Ncube, who came to Britain from Zimbabwe earlier this year, said he had been forced to borrow money from relatives to cover the cost of a \u00a32,000 \u201cadministration fee\u201d for finding his job, with \u00a3250 a month deducted from his salary. After rent, bills, food and other expenses \u2013 including a fee to hire a company car \u2013 he is left with \u201cnothing\u201d, despite working overtime. John, whose name has been changed to protect him, cannot leave his role because of a repayment clause that says he must pay almost \u00a34,000 if he quits within two years. \u201cIt\u2019s frustrating and depressing. You\u2019re really tired and you\u2019re pushing yourself to the limit. It doesn\u2019t make sense at all,\u201d he said. \u201cMany people back home do not realise recruitment fees are illegal because they are so common. Even if they did, many would come anyway. That\u2019s the most heartbreaking thing. The agents and employers see their desperation.\u201d The findings raise urgent concerns about modern slavery in Britain and come amid a worsening social care staffing crisis, with vacancy rates in England reaching 10%, according to the charity Skills for Care. In February, the government added care workers to the shortage occupation list, relaxing the requirements for them to come to Britain provided they are sponsored by an employer. Announcing the scheme, home secretary Priti Patel said it would \u201chelp alleviate\u201d the pressures by attracting thousands of international care workers. But four months on, the evidence suggests the route is being widely exploited by rogue recruiters. New figures reveal that recruitment fees are part of a wider picture of worsening exploitation in the sector. Kate Terroni, chief inspector of adult social care at the Care Quality Commission, which regulates health and social care in England, said there had been a \u201cnotable rise\u201d in referrals for modern slavery in 2022 and was working with other agencies to tackle it. There have been 14 referrals this year so far \u2013 double the entire number for 2021 and almost five times the total 2020 figure. Unseen UK, the charity which runs the national modern slavery helpline, said it saw 78 potential victims of modern slavery and labour exploitation in the care sector in 2021, double the 2020 figure. Other cases seen by the Observer reveal that workers are also being trafficked into the care sector by illegal routes. In one case, an 18-year-old was brought from West Africa as the spouse of a man on a student visa and forced to work as a domiciliary carer. The teenager and her family believed she was going to work in the beauty industry, but she was registered to a UK care agency using a fake identity.  The teenager was forced to work 10 hours a day, seven days a week, while the money went into someone else\u2019s bank account, according to Debbie Ariyo, chair of the BME Anti-Slavery Network. \u201cShe was really exploited. They would call her on the phone to harass her: \u2018How come you\u2019re not at work? What are you doing?\u2019\u201d Ariyo said. In another case identified by the charity Kanlungan, which supports Filipino migrants, a husband and wife came with their son after being offered employment as physiotherapists. On arrival they realised they were being made to do care work instead, being deployed to private households across the south-east. They spent months being moved around, earning below minimum wage with little time off, and were allegedly told by their employers: \u201cIf you don\u2019t work we\u2019ll make you homeless tomorrow and report you to the Home Office.\u201d The Gangmasters and Labour Abuse Authority, sponsored by the Home Office, has become increasingly concerned about care sector abuses in recent months, with raids resulting in arrests of suspects for modern slavery-related offences. To tackle the problems, experts and campaigners are calling for greater oversight of the care sector and an overhaul of the Home Office visa sponsorship system. Some have called for jobs to be advertised on a government portal to make it easier for candidates to apply directly, cutting out agents and other middlemen. There are also calls for care to become a GLAA-licensed sector, like agriculture. This would mean all recruitment agents, both inside and outside the UK, would need a licence to supply workers, with conditions stipulating they \u201cmust not charge a fee to a worker for any work finding services\u201d and the agency able to inspect applicants and investigate concerns.  Neill Wilkins, head of the migrant workers\u2019 programme at the Institute for Human Rights and Business, said recruitment fees were trapping workers in conditions akin to modern-day slavery and called for urgent action to tackle the abuses. \u201cPeople have this view of modern slavery where they think of chains and incarceration,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it\u2019s not like that at all. The chains that bind people these days are nearly always financial.\u201d"

                    "body": "  7.30pm    And here\u2019s our match report; now it really is goodbye. Goodbye!       7.04pm    Otherwise, though, it\u2019s ta-ra from me. Peace out.      7.03pm    Righto, that\u2019s us for now. Except it isn\u2019t really, because all you actually need to do is click here to find Germany v Spain, along with Rob Smyth, there to glory your evening.       7.02pm    As for Denmark, they\u2019ll have to play a lot better than that to get something against Spain. Where there\u2019s Harder there\u2019s hope, but based on what we\u2019ve seen so far, that looks a forlorn one.      6.57pm    Finland, you\u2019ve to assume, will wonder if they might\u2019ve done more. They had nothing going forward and even after Denmark looked blunt in the first half, rather than seek a win, they stuck another player in defence and still conceded chances.    Updated at 7.16pm BST    6.55pm   Full-time: Denmark 1-0 Finland  Christensen lets it all out at the whistle and it\u2019s she to whom her mates run, not their goalscoring captain. that tells you all you need to know, and Denmark are still in the competition, while Finland are almost home.    Updated at 7.04pm BST    6.54pm    90+4 min ...and Christensen comes to gather! She has saved her team!      6.54pm    90+3 min Lene Christensen! Ninety-three minutes of staring, then Danielsson skips away from Holmgaard, who wails in fear, unleashes a banger of a shot ... and Christensen tips it behind! That\u2019s a brilliant save, but her comes the corner...     6.51pm    90+1 min And if Finland are still losing at the end of them, a draw in the Germany v Spain game which comes next will put them out.      6.50pm    90 min There\u2019ll be four added minutes.      6.50pm    90 min Last try for Finland: Westerlund is replaced by Danielsson.       6.49pm    88 min So far, Denmark have seen this out well \u2013 though Finland haven\u2019t tested them much, even to the extent of smashing it mixer.      6.46pm    86 min Boye replaces Harder, now sat at the side with a hunk of ice on her phizog.      6.46pm    85 min Eeesh! Harder is bodied by Kolvisto competing for a header, and after receiving treatment on the park, she\u2019s escorted off looking woozy.    Updated at 6.52pm BST    6.44pm    84 min Finland win a free-kick just left of centre and Franssi floats a decent delivery into the box ... and Kuikka, in the middle of a phalanx of defenders, is up! She gets the touch too, but it\u2019s no more than a flick and sails behind.      6.42pm    82 min Finland have barely had the ball since conceding but they move forward now with Ahtinen, who slices a shot wide and plenty.      6.40pm    80 min Nice from Larsen, who battles down the right and finds the recently-impressive Johnsen, who curves in a low cross first-time ... but Westerlund gets it away.      6.38pm    78 min Finland send on Ahtinen for Sallstrom.      6.38pm    76 min Sevecke slides in on Summanen, feathers the top of the ball almost inadvertently then ploughs through her opponent ... and somehow evades a second yellow card. I don\u2019t especially object to challenges like that being punished with a free-kick and nothing more, but I don\u2019t see how the laws allow such thing.      6.35pm    75 min In the Germany game, Harder didn\u2019t manage a touch in the opposition box. Against admittedly lesser opposition, she\u2019s been much better today, and I\u2019d expect her to sustain that improvement for the Spain game because she\u2019s too good not to. However, her teammates will have to do more to find her.      6.34pm    74 min With the deadlock now broken, I\u2019d not be surprised to see Denmark add another goal or two.      6.34pm   GOAL! Denmark 1-0 Finland (Harder 72)  One hundred and sixty-two minutes and out! Harder wins the ball high up the pitch as Finland see to bring it cleat and another decent cross from right-wing to back post, Johnsen with it again, sees Larsen up! But Holmgaard finds redemption by leaping all over her, banging a header onto the bar with enough force so that it bounces out in the middle and straight to Harder ... who adjusts well by retreating quickly, sorting out her feet to nod home from three yards.     Updated at 7.00pm BST    6.31pm    71 min Denmark have improved in the last few minutes \u2013 perhaps the changes are working, perhaps Finland are tiring, perhaps both \u2013 but I\u2019m a little surprised they\u2019ve retained the formation that is now 161 minutes without a goal.      6.30pm    69 min Korpela! Harder controls beautifully and beats two players, one for skill by dipping inside, and one for pace by screeching away. Then, having moved from left to centre, she releases a glorious pass into the stride of Holmgaard! She\u2019s in! But she hangs onto the ball for too long her final touch is too heavy, and the Spurs keeper times her advance perfectly yet again, smothering the shot at source!     6.27pm    66 min Sevecke loses possession to Oling, tugs her back for a while, and is eventually booked.      6.26pm    65 min Johnsen speeds down the right and stands up a superb cross to the far post, where Kolvisto does really well to get up above Svava.      6.25pm    64 min Two more changes for Denmark, Holmgaard K and Larsen replacing Bruun and Troelsgaard.      6.23pm    62 min Decent from Denmark, Svava finding Harder who picks across the face of the box before finding Troelsgaard, on the right of the box. It\u2019s a decent shooting opportunity ... that she slices so badly it finds Svava again! She nips inside Kolvisto, sending her off towards M&amp;S, sets back for Junge who shapes to curl into the far corner ... and tickles a shank that floats wide.      6.20pm    60 min Oling zones forward with the ball, has a look, has a shot, and Christensen saves easily enough.      6.19pm    59 min \u201cIt\u2019s tempting to attribute those misplaced final balls to nerves,\u201d posits Charles Antaki, \u201cafter all only three points would be any use in maintaining what is anyway a pretty slim chance of either of these two progressing from the group. So any chance must feel like a final chance, and any attempt must feel like the only attempt. End of saloon-bar pontification.\u201d That is possible, though I wonder if they\u2019re able to think about that in the moment. My guess is that over-eagerness is also involves, though in its way that\u2019s the other side of the same coin.      6.17pm    58 min Svava is into the action immediately, nashing down the left and crossing with Hrder loitering, but Westerlund is there first.      6.16pm    56 min A double change for Denmark: off go Nadim, who must be knackered, with Bredgard coming on, along with Thrige, who must be naused, with Svava coming on.      6.14pm    54 min Ballisager challenges Kolvisto on inside the box and Kolvisto collapses. There\u2019s a penalty appeal, but nothing doing and rightly so.      6.12pm    53 min Thrige, Denmarks\u2019 most dangerous player when on the right but now on the left, tries a cross that hits Kolvisto\u2019s hand, but there was no intent.   Updated at 6.14pm BST    6.11pm    51 min I wonder if Denmark might try Harder down the middle at some point, either alone, or with a partner. She\u2019s too much better than her teammates to be hoping the ball appears on her side.      6.10pm    50 min A better cross from Thomsen and this time Korpela spills it ... but quickly recovers to fall on the ball.      6.08pm    49 min Again the ball goes out Thomsen, and again the cross is a miserable one, flying behind.      6.08pm    48 min Finland have moved to a back five, which I guess denies Denmark space and perhaps allows them to attack space on the counter.      6.07pm    47 min Excellent from Harder off the bat, diddling Pikkuajamsa on the outside and squaring for Nadim ... but again, her finishing is hampered by rust as she tries to sweep towards the far corner, ballooning away from goal in the opposite direction. Best chance of the match so far \u2013 and by far.      6.05pm    46 min We go again, no changes to either side.      6.04pm    During half-time, BBC screened VT highlighting the lack of diversity in women\u2019s football in England. Hopefully this tournament does something to improve things, but ultimately we need funding from government and the wider game too.      5.55pm    Noooooo!  For those not as well-versed as I in the old Hollandish, this is what that means: Vivianne Miedema has unfortunately tested positive for COVID-19 and will therefore be in isolation for the next few days. When she no longer has any symptoms and tests negative, she can rejoin the selection. So hopefully she\u2019s good for the knockouts, at least.      5.50pm    Half-time reading:       5.49pm   Half-time: Denmark 0-0 Finland  Finaldn have been solid, Korpela in particular, and Denmark have thinking to do.      5.49pm    45+2 min Nadim finds Harder who picks out Thomsen with a fine early ball; there\u2019s time for the cross. But Thomsen, who\u2019s had a poor half, can only waft behind.      5.48pm    45+1 min Korpela does well to flap the corner away, then from outside the box, Veje meets the loose ball and lamp behind.    Updated at 7.17pm BST    5.47pm    45 min There\u2019ll be two added minutes.      5.47pm    45 min Harder slips to Trige on her outside, but again, Korpela \u2013 who was also good against Spain \u2013 advances well, to smother behind before cross or shot can be attempted.      5.46pm    44 min Then Sevecke seeks Nadim, but Pikkujamsa intercepts.      5.45pm    44 min The corners finds Harder, whose cross is headed away; Oling will try a long throw...     5.45pm    43 min Pedersen lofts a nice ball out to Thomsen, still on the right, and her curling cross is a goodun. But Kuikka is alert enough to wave a leg that sends the ball behind.      5.44pm    40 min More directionless Denmark possession.     5.42pm    38 min Nice from Finland, Sainio making ground on the right and clipping a clever pass into the box that bisects two defenders, finding Kolvisto. So she tries to measure a cross into the middle for Oling, which is just too far in front of her and instead slips just past the far post.      5.40pm    37 min Bit of possession from Finland \u2013 they\u2019re playing well.    Updated at 6.32pm BST    5.37pm    35 min The corner comes to nothing, which is to say that Finland have done a decent job tightening up at the back.      5.36pm    34 min Now it\u2019s Thomsen with a shot, but again Korpela does the necessary, turning behind.      5.36pm    33 min Best bit of play from Denmark so far, Nadim finding Bruun who returns the favour as Harder steps over, but the resultant shot trickles wide.      5.35pm    33 min Troelsgaard mooches through midfield and sends Harder in, but Kuikka does really well to stay with her which, along with a poor first touch, means Korpela can race out to smother.      5.34pm    31 min Almost all of Denmark\u2019s best play has come down the right, but Thrige, responsible for much of it, has swapped with Thomsen. Perhaps S\u00f8ndergaard thinks he can retain that from the former, while getting more from the latter.      5.32pm    30 min The corner comes to nowt.      5.32pm    29 min Better again from Denmark, again down the right; Sevecke finds Harder, who attacks the box from the side, but Pikkujamsa gets in the road, knocking the ball behind.      5.31pm    29 min Aaaarrrggghhh! Harder finds Thrige down the right and she\u2019s loads of time to pick out a cross ... but sends an absolute dog straight to Korpela.      5.29pm    27 min Bruun takes possession in centrefield and drives forward, but she hangs on too long to feed in Thomsen on her outside so has no choice but to have a dig herself, lashing wide.      5.28pm    26 min Harder appears down the right, but her cross is easily seen off. Ultimately, sticking the ball in with only one striker waiting means it needs to be perfect to create anything.      5.27pm    25 min Denmark just aren\u2019t moving enough to disconcert Finland\u2019s defence, nor getting the ball to their attackers in space, so they can get a run on any of its members one on one. They\u2019re also not switching play quickly enough, which means the opposing back four can just shuffle back or across.      5.24pm    23 min We\u2019ve seen hardly anything of Harder - or Bruun for that matter. That\u2019s partly because Finland are defending well, but also because her teammates aren\u2019t finding her as they should be.    Updated at 6.00pm BST    5.23pm    22 min Exhibit A:       5.23pm    21 min Interesting insight from elsewhere in this group. Miedema isn\u2019t far off the best player in the world, and this is part of the reason why.       5.21pm    19 min Better from Finland, Franssi moving the ball down the left then inside to Sainio, who shifts is one more to Summanen, who drags her shot wide.    Updated at 5.37pm BST    5.20pm    18 min \u201cGreat to see Nadim start!\u201d emails Andy Grey. \u201cClass player, seriously hoping she scores a goal as she\u2019s just recovered from ACL rehab.\u201d Yup, that injury at any age, never mind at 34, is a brutal thing. But she\u2019s good enough to affect this tournament even though she won\u2019t be whats she was, definitely not now and perhaps not ever again/      5.19pm    17 min They do then get out, but Pikkujamsa can only hump a long cross towards the far side of the box, where Veje heads away easily.      5.18pm    16 min Denmark are dominating now, Finland sitting deep and struggling to progress beyond the confines of their own half.      5.17pm    14 min In that break, we see Korpela save again, and it was a better one that that for which I gave her credit. Nadim\u2019s shot went of heel and foot, but the angle sent it pretty wide of the keeper, who had to dive then stretch again to push away.      5.16pm    13 min Ballisager heads Sallstrom, so there\u2019s a break while she\u2019s treated.      5.16pm    12 min \u201cI\u2019ve always thought that the lack of lyrics for a national anthem puts the team (eg Spain\u2019s) at a huge advantage right at the start, says Charles Antaki. \u201cWhatever nonsense the others have to sing, it\u2019s going to come out either manic or lacklustre and musically atrocious one way or the other.\u201d I\u2019m not the best person to opine on this because I\u2019m Jewish and our liturgy is full of wordless tunes with nye-nye-nyes replacing lyrics, so I\u2019m naturally disposed to the proposal.      5.13pm    10 min Thrige again down the right and this time her cross is excellent, low, quick, and with Junge\u2019s near-post stepover obfuscating its path from the defence. But Nadim, in the middle, doesn\u2019t catch her shot properly, trying to guide it into the far bottom corner, so again Korpela saves.      5.11pm    9 min Lovely from Nadim, getting a run on Pikkujamsa and chucking a pair of lollipops before gliding on the outside, opening a shooting lane. Her effort is a decent one too, but it\u2019s straight at Korpela who saves easily enough.      5.09pm    7 min Troelsgaard has Thrige outside and does pick the overlap, but the resultant cross is a poor one and Finland clear.      5.08pm    6 min Denmark have settled, now keeping possession better and picking up second balls. And as I write that, Harder is on the edge of the box with Sevecke outside her and no defender close. But she opts to shoot and is blocked at source.   Updated at 5.09pm BST    5.06pm    4 min Email! \u201cIf we include teams with sweepers, there were a number of serious teams with back threes,\u201d reckons K\u00e1ri Tulinius. \u201cArgentina\u2019s 1986 World Cup winners spring to mind. As for this competition, I\u2019ve found it very enjoyable. It\u2019s threatening to be a classic tournament, though it\u2019s still too early to tell.\u201d To address your second point first, I couldn\u2019t agree more \u2013 there are so many potential winners \u2013 and the only decent thing about the Qatar World Cup is that it gives this tournament centre stage. And yes, I guess if we allow sweepers we can also allow West Germany 1990.      5.04pm    2 min Finland start the faster and after Ballisager mops up a ball in behind, Kuikka wellies a shot well over the bar from roughly 69.51 yards.      5.03pm    1 min Our commentators are Mark Scott and Scott Booth, which reminds me of the old London Underground thing, Green Park, Park Royal, Royal Oak, Oakwood, Wood Green, Green Park.      5.02pm    1 min Peep! Peep!     5.02pm    The players take the knee, then it\u2019s off we go!     5.01pm    Back to the managers, though, it\u2019s quite a thing to say your players lost their bottle. I guess if the alternative explanation was that they were outclassed, it makes some kind of sense.      4.58pm    There\u2019s little better than footballers singing tunelessly, and Finland\u2019s do not let us down.      4.57pm    The players are with us! Anthem time!      4.54pm    Anna Signeul, the Finland manager, says her players are ready and loved the atmosphere last time, while Lars S\u00f8ndergaard, her Danish counterpart says his team lost its collective nerve against Germany, unable to find spaces with the ball and close them without it.    Updated at 4.56pm BST    4.52pm    So how do we feel about this tournament so far? England were superb last night, yet I couldn\u2019t help but think about Argentina 6-0 Serbia from the group stages of the 2006 World Cup. It\u2019s not often the best side in the first phase is the best side at the end. Next, they play the second-placed team in this group, and that will be a stern test, however much Spain miss the injured Putellas.      4.46pm    On which point, in the history of football, how many properly serious teams have played three at the back? I can think of Van Gaal\u2019s Ajax and Del Bosque\u2019s Madrid, but after that I\u2019m struggling. I guess we can allow Conte\u2019s Juventus and Chelsea if we\u2019re being generous.      4.44pm    Something that might work for Finland: 4-4-2 is very decent antidote to 3-4-3 \u2013 even more so than 3-5-2 because you don\u2019t even lose the numbers game in midfield. But that aside, it means the defenders have two attackers to deal with, not one, while on each flank, there\u2019s a full-back and a wide player able to exploit the space behind the wing-backs and outside the back line.      4.33pm    Anyone unacquainted with Nadia Nadim can address that situation here:      4.30pm    As for Finland, with Hyyrynen inured, Kuikka comes in at centre-back and Pikkujamsa moves to to the left with Koivisto on the right while, on the right of midfield, Sainio is in for Engman.      4.26pm    But what does it all mean? Denmark make two changes from the team walloped by Germany. On the right of midfield, Thrige comes in with Thomsen moving to the left and Svava dropping out, while Kuhl is also unavailable after being sent-off in injury time. And in attack, the heroic Nadim replaces Madsen.   Updated at 5.21pm BST    4.13pm   Teams!  Denmark (3-4-3): Christensen; Sevecke, Ballisager, Veje; Thrige, Troelsgaard S ,Junge, Thomsen; Nadim, Bruun, Harder. Subs: Svane, Nielsen, Boye Sorensen, Holmgaard K, Holmgaard S, larsen, Bredgaard, Madsen, FGevitz, Gejl, Svava. Finland(4-4-2): Korpela; Kolvisto, Westerlund, Kuikka, Pikkujamsa; Sainio, Alanen, Summanen, Oling; Sallstrom, Franssi. Subs: Talaslahtim Tamminen, Auvinen, Ahtinen, Kemppi, Heroum, Danielsson, Kollanen, Rantanen, Rantala.   Updated at 4.36pm BST    4.00pm   Preamble  It\u2019s a problem not entirely of their own making \u2013 they didn\u2019t draw themselves in a group with Germany and Spain \u2013 but whichever way you look at it, these teams are in trouble. If there\u2019s a loser here, they\u2019re almost certainly going home \u2013 bad for them, yes, but for us? Let\u2019s get it on!  Finland actually started their game against Spain nicely, taking the lead and missing a decent chance to double the advantage. They ended up taking a hiding nevertheless, and will be particularly disappointed that, of the four goals they conceded, three were headers and the other a penalty. On the other hand, though, those are aspects of play that can be tightened up with a little more focus, and if that happens, they\u2019re a live dog in this match.  Denmark, meanwhile, started the competition with more significant hopes than the rank outsiders. Though only four of the XI that lost the 2017 final began against Germany \u2013 the year-long delay helped some teams and hindered others \u2013 the incredible Pernille Harder remains in her prime, capable of winning any game on her own.

                    "body": "For Antonio R\u00fcdiger, today is another day, the time to get back in the saddle, to build up towards Chelsea\u2019s next big game \u2013 the FA Cup semi-final against Crystal Palace at Wembley on Sunday. There is no point in being sad any more. The steeliness of his professionalism will, as usual, kick in. But it is probably fair to describe Wednesday as a lost day for R\u00fcdiger, when the pain and frustration of what had happened in Madrid on Tuesday night gnawed away, tormenting him.  Few players take defeat as hard as R\u00fcdiger and one of the most vivid snapshots of Chelsea\u2019s Champions League quarter-final exit against Real Madrid at the Bernab\u00e9u came after the full-time whistle. As Real celebrated their 5-4 aggregate passage, despite a 3-2 defeat on the night, R\u00fcdiger lay prone. The Real defender David Alaba helped him to his feet but R\u00fcdiger appeared oblivious, locked instead in an internal argument, heavy on violent movements and exhortations to the sky. Then, he sank back down to the ground, head in hands, seemingly wanting to curl up into a ball. R\u00fcdiger had been emotional throughout. Perhaps, with his future uncertain \u2013 out of contract in June and with no immediate prospect of an extension as Chelsea remain between owners \u2013 he sensed a kind of swan-song, the final stretch at a club where he is adored by the support. More likely, though, this was just R\u00fcdiger, the heart-on-sleeve competitor. The central defender had scored for 2-0 on the night, powering home a 51st-minute header from Mason Mount\u2019s corner and, in stoppage time at the end of the 90 minutes \u2013 the tie level at 4-4 \u2013 it was his header that teed up the substitute Christian Pulisic for a chance to win it, which he really should have taken.  R\u00fcdiger\u2019s best defensive moment had come in the 68th minute when he stretched to intercept a Toni Kroos pass that was intended for Vin\u00edcius J\u00fanior after N\u2019Golo Kant\u00e9 had given the ball away in central midfield. R\u00fcdiger leapt to his feet and, eyes popping with fury, he made Kant\u00e9 perfectly aware of how he felt. For R\u00fcdiger, it is about standards and focus. Which is why he would have been so disappointed at himself for Real\u2019s extra-time winner, headed in by Karim Benzema. When Vin\u00edcius crossed from the left, R\u00fcdiger did not appear to notice Benzema dropping off, buying the crucial space and, when he turned round, it was too late. To compound R\u00fcdiger\u2019s agony and the impression of helplessness, he slipped as he did so. What was noticeable when R\u00fcdiger faced the TV cameras after the match was his realism. Thomas Tuchel, the Chelsea manager, had lamented the \u201ctwo crucial ball losses\u201d before each of the Real goals. Kant\u00e9 saw a pass upfield cut out before the first and Thiago Silva misplaced a ball towards Kant\u00e9 on the second. But Tuchel also muttered darkly about the influence of the Bernab\u00e9u crowd on referees. R\u00fcdiger looked solely at Chelsea\u2019s shortcomings and they included his own. \u201cOver the two legs, if you make the kind of mistakes like we did, you get punished,\u201d he said.  It is how R\u00fcdiger has long operated. No excuses, only home truths. He analyses his own game first and he is not the sort of player to demand reassurances from his inner circle; yes men to tell him how wonderful he is. On the contrary. One of the biggest influences on his career is his half-brother and agent, Sahr Senesie, who played professionally himself. Senesie will tell him the unvarnished truth and R\u00fcdiger will listen. R\u00fcdiger will use the Madrid heartbreak as fuel and, like everybody at the club, he knows that the Palace tie has the potential to make or break the season. Chelsea are geared to reach finals, to win trophies, and the FA Cup is all they have left. They have to build on the many positives of the performance at the Bernab\u00e9u. R\u00fcdiger has gone from outcast under Frank Lampard to talismanic mainstay under Tuchel but, as things stand, he is more likely to leave the club in the summer than stay. Then again, what better opening move could the new owners make than to secure him to a new contract? The clock is ticking loudly. R\u00fcdiger\u2019s eyes are on Palace."

                    "body": "Joe Biden has made clear that the Middle East is not a priority for his administration: Ukraine, China and the US midterm elections are all more pressing issues. Still, when Air Force One touches down in Tel Aviv for his first visit to the region as president on Wednesday afternoon, Biden will be faced with a rapidly changing \u2013 and still unstable \u2013 part of the world. Biden\u2019s main goal is to convince Saudi Arabia of the need to increase global oil supplies to ease the energy crisis sparked by Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. But the fact that he flies directly to Jeddah after two days in Israel and the occupied Palestinian territories speaks to a significant shift: Israel\u2019s transformation from regional pariah to ally for many Arab states. The lead-up to Biden\u2019s trip has been dominated by news of developing defence cooperation between Israel and several of its neighbours to combat the threat posed by the growing military prowess of Iran and its proxies in the region. Bahrain, Jordan and Egypt \u2013 as well as Saudi Arabia and Qatar, countries with which Israel does not have formal diplomatic relations \u2013 were among the nations reportedly represented in secret talks with Israeli military officials in the Egyptian Red Sea resort of Sharm el-Sheikh earlier this year. While Arab countries have downplayed or refused to comment on whether the summit took place, senior Israeli officials stressed the day before Biden\u2019s arrival that US leadership had facilitated \u201cupgraded interactions\u201d between Israel and its regional partners in recent months, and that gradual steps were being made towards normalisation with Saudi Arabia. The warming relationship between two of the Middle East\u2019s most powerful nations builds on the Abraham accords, agreements between Israel and the UAE, Bahrain, Morocco and Sudan facilitated by the Trump administration. The declarations ended a decades-old taboo in Arab diplomacy. The region\u2019s mostly autocratic governments have grown apathetic to the occupation of the Palestinian territories, and Israel and the Gulf states have a common enemy in Iran. At the same time, the US \u2013 which has traditionally seen itself as the Middle East\u2019s security guarantor \u2013 has been pulling away from the region in recent years, forcing its Israeli and Gulf allies to explore alternatives. \u201cThe idea of defence cooperation comes at a time when the US is reluctant to face up to the Iranian threat and to provide protection; based on what we\u2019ve seen recently when Saudi Arabia and the UAE have been attacked by drones [claimed by Yemen\u2019s Iran-supported Houthi rebels]. It seems they are in no mood to do that job, even though beforehand many believed they would,\u201d said Abdulkhaleq Abdulla, a professor of political science at the United Arab Emirates University. Benny Gantz, Israel\u2019s defence minister until the short-lived coalition government collapsed last month, recently described what he called the \u201cMiddle East air defence alliance\u201d as already operational, claiming it had shot down an Iranian drone fired towards Israel from Iraq. The Sharm el-Sheikh summit\u2019s participants reportedly agreed in principle to coordinate rapid notification systems when aerial threats are detected, and discussed potential decision-making processes on which country\u2019s forces would intercept drone, ballistic or cruise missile attacks. Alerts are supposed to be sent via phones and computers, rather than a US-style military data-sharing system. Support from political leaders would be needed to codify broader military cooperation. Some are worried that formalising any security mechanisms could push Iran into a corner at a time when Tehran and Washington are still trying to rescue the international deal curbing Iran\u2019s nuclear programme scrapped by Trump in 2018. \u201cAll this talk of a regional pact, like a Middle East Nato \u2013 that would go too far,\u201d Abdulla said. \u201cIt is still possible to engage Iran in talks, and that should be every stakeholder\u2019s priority.\u201d Several US administrations have attempted to build formal military alliances between Middle Eastern nations in the past, although the reported Middle East air defence alliance would mark the first time Israel has been included in such plans. \u201cNormalisation makes a lot of sense. But what is fascinating is that even though the consensus seems to be that peace with the Palestinians is no longer anyone\u2019s top priority \u2013 maybe not even in the top five \u2013 and that\u2019s why Arab states can now engage with Israel, the minute the Palestinian issue is resolved peacefully, then all of this could just be out in the open,\u201d said Yossi Mekelberg, an associate fellow at London\u2019s Chatham House thinktank. \u201cIt may be that these security arrangements are more talk than substance, or they may never materialise. But either way it shows that the Palestinians can\u2019t be ignored completely.\u201d In a volatile neighbourhood, Saudi Arabia \u2013 notorious for human rights abuses at home and in its war in Yemen \u2013 is currently perhaps the Palestinians\u2019 most forthright ally. Riyadh appears to be adhering to a 2002 Arab League peace initiative that demands an end to the occupation before relations with Israel can be established. \u201cArab countries are free to take any decision they want, any relationship they need to have, but that does not need to be at the expense of a principled position against Israeli occupation,\u201d said Ghassan Khatib, an international studies lecturer at Ramallah\u2019s Birzeit University. \u201cOur expectations from Biden\u2019s trip are low. The new administration has different rhetoric, but practically speaking they have not moved far from the previous government. It is disappointing, but not surprising, that the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is on the back burner even when he comes to visit.\u201d"

                    "body": "Thomas Tuchel has opened up on Andreas Christensen withdrawing from Chelsea\u2019s FA Cup final defeat by Liverpool on the morning of the game, claiming it was not the first time the defender had pulled out of a match at short notice. Christensen, who is set to join Barcelona this summer, forced Tuchel into a late rethink for the final when he made himself unavailable despite not being injured. The Denmark centre-back was in line to start but he has complained of stomach issues before games in the past and it is unclear whether he will be involved when Chelsea host Leicester on Thursday and Watford on Sunday.  \u201cAndreas came in the morning of the match to inform me, speak to me,\u201d Tuchel said. \u201cHe told me he was not ready to play the match, to start the match and be on the bench. He had his reasons. They stay private and confidential. It was not the first time as you can see over the last weeks that we had some of the same situations. \u201cThat\u2019s why he did not play regularly over the last weeks. We thought we are in a good progression, development because he played a strong match before the final against Leeds. The conversation took place. We had to respect it. Of course. He has our support still but for tomorrow I am unsure. It was very short notice before the Cup final, not only before this match. Other matches the weeks before. No chance I have a prediction before tomorrow or the weekend.\u201d It remains to be seen whether Christensen is given a send-off at Stamford Bridge. The 26-year-old is out of contract at the end of the season and agreed to join Barcelona after negotiations with Chelsea over a new deal broke down. Tuchel, who is also losing Antonio R\u00fcdiger to Real Madrid, said that he wanted C\u00e9sar Azpilicueta to stay at Chelsea. Barcelona are targeting Azpilicueta, who has triggered a one-year extension in his contract, and Chelsea could let their captain leave. \u201cWe had a lot of these talks because very genuinely it felt like he won everything after the Club World Cup,\u201d Tuchel said. \u201cGiven his personal situation I can understand maybe a cycle is at its end. Then it\u2019s a change of ownership, so it maybe increased his thoughts about his situation. \u201cBut then his extension kicked in and he loves the club. We are still in a dialogue and we are also selfish \u2013 we are not responsible to solve any other club\u2019s problems. Given we already lose key defenders, it\u2019s not ideal to think about losing Azpi. At some point if you are a legend you deserve maybe also from me and the club a second look at it.\u201d Tuchel said he needed Azpilicueta\u2019s leadership but he acknowledged that he must see whether the Spaniard is committed to the club after 10 years. \u201cHe is everything that Chelsea is about,\u201d the German said. \u201cBut there are more layers to consider. If he cannot get rid of this feeling \u2026 we find out if he can give all that makes him special. \u201cWith all respect he can only be special if he is committed 100% and does not have one concern in his head that he should have done something differently.\u201d Tuchel added that Chelsea, who cannot sell or buy players until their takeover is complete, faced a big task to strengthen their defence. They want to sign two centre-backs and are expected to revive their interest in Sevilla\u2019s Jules Kound\u00e9 after Todd Boehly\u2019s consortium has bought the club from Roman Abramovich."

                    "body": "With little appetite in Europe for a further wave of sanctions on Russia, and Annalena Baerbock, the German foreign minister, raising the prospect of a popular uprising in Germany this autumn over gas prices, Ukraine and its allies are focused on tightening the existing panoply of sanctions rather than putting forward more radical proposals. As many as 20 countries may be involved in bypassing the current sanctions, Ukraine reckons. Ukraine cannot but be nervous that the popular revolt of which Baerbock warned \u2013 before quickly regretting her choice of words \u2013 will mean support for the war erodes before a Ukrainian military counteroffensive can bolster it. \u201cIn Ukraine Putin fights with missiles and tanks, in Europe he fights with gas prices,\u201d says the Ukrainian foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba. Andrii Yermak, lead adviser to the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, is clearly wary of how public opinion may turn and says it would be a mistake to allow the war to drag on into winter. The war has to be settled this year, he believes. He claims, and hopes, the people of Milan and Berlin value the price of freedom in Europe over the price of gas. But even the UK\u2019s rock-solid political support for Ukraine may waver if energy bills hit \u00a3500 a month in January. It is an endurance test, in which the two competitors play by different rules. After all, Putin does not have to listen to public opinion; he decides it. All that can be assumed is that Putin will keep turning down the gas taps using various pretexts such as turbine failure in the hope that Europe panics about what lies ahead. Thus on Wednesday the Russian energy group Gazprom cut the flow of gas through the Nord Stream 1 pipeline to about one-fifth of capacity. European gas prices have now risen ninefold in the past year. So in this massive hybrid war, and ahead of the winter crunch point, Europe is preparing its defences on every front in the hope that its storage facilities are stocked ready for the winter. Europe has been scouring the world for alternative energy supplies from countries such as Nigeria, Algeria, Kazakhstan, Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Iraq. The Saudi crown prince Mohammed bin Salman, previously persona non grata, was welcomed at the \u00c9lys\u00e9e on Thursday. In the midst of the fall of his government, the Italian prime minister, Mario Draghi, found time to fly to Tangier, and EU officials went to Lagos to offer to improve security for gas installations. The German economic minister, Robert Habeck, bent the knee in Doha. Diplomacy has become a substratum of energy policy. On the demand side, an agreement by EU states this week to reduce domestic demand voluntarily by as much as 15% on prewar levels is a step forward, even if the deal is full of get-out clauses, and is ultimately down to nation states and sacrifice by individuals in their homes and offices. Solidarity measures are in place, but the room for the ECB to keep raising interest rates is reducing as fears of recession grow. The difficulty is that some European governments are more exposed to Russian intimidation than others. In 2021, a total of 14 countries received more than 50% of their gas from Russia. Germany in particular fears it is a sitting duck, prompting the CDU leader of Saxony, Michael Kretschmer, to warn this week that if a peace settlement is not negotiated, Germany could become deindustrialised. He may be representing east German views, but everyone is living on their nerves. Germany cannot afford the luxury of debating its past foreign policy mistakes. \u201cIn security policy, in our Russia policy, in our energy policy, we are at ground zero and have to start from scratch,\u201d Walter Ischinger, the former German diplomat said on Thursday. Italy, by comparison, is more prepared. The government said this week it would be independent of all Russian gas supply from the second half of 2024, and to get through this winter required only a cut of 7% in current consumption.  But if the purpose of sanctions, and consequent pain in Europe, is to cripple Russian revenues, it is not yet working. Oil deliveries in physical terms fell by 13% from May to June, from 18.9m tonnes to 16.5m tonnes, but revenues actually increased a little to \u20ac10.5bn (\u00a38.7bn), and are higher than for the same period in 2021. Russian gas exports fell by about a quarter in June compared with last year, but earnings rose to $11.1bn (\u00a39.1bn) compared with $3.6bn. The US has been working on the details of a price cap on Russian oil ever since the G7 in Germany, but the plan still has many hurdles to overcome, not least potential resistance by India and China. Meanwhile, a parallel plan for a unilateral gas price cap, proposed by Mario Draghi, may be fading along with his government.  Michael McFaul, the former US ambassador to Russia and now part of an international working group on sanctions, is bullish that they are working, despite a rise in the ruble, lower interest rates, and banks awash with cash. He points out that sanctions on Iran started in 2010 and it took until 2015 for Tehran to be pressured into agreeing a deal on nuclear nonproliferation. He argues that Russia being so active in trying to stop sanctions is the best sign that they are working. There is no shortage of ideas for making the sanctions more effective, including introducing national legislation that permits governments to move from freezing the personal assets of Russian oligarchs to seizing them. This would be facilitated by a global register of what has been frozen. Russia, the group suggests, should be declared a terrorist state, a move that would increase the threat of secondary sanctions by the US. Finally, new laws should be introduced requiring mandatory disclosure of information about any business contacts, joint ownership of corporate rights and property with Russian citizens. A draft of such a resolution has already been submitted to the US Congress. Such measures would force US firms to divest. Proposals are pouring out of the McFaul working group. The pre-eminent issue is the west\u2019s continuing willingness to implement them."

                    "body": "  3.15pm   Afternoon summary  A quick recap of the main points. Asia-Pacific markets have dropped as anti-Covid lockdown protests broke out at dozens of Chinese cities last weekend. The demonstrations, as Covid-19 infections rise at record pace, have fuelled fears that China\u2019s economic recovery could stumble. Oil has hit its lowest level since January, while China\u2019s yuan fell to a two-week low, as investor anxiety rose. UK retailers have reported a drop in sales this month, and warned that December will be weak too, as the cost of living crisis hits the sector. World trade growth has slowed, the WTO reports, another warning sign. And the National Grid has backed away from triggering a power-saving plan to prevent blackouts tomorrow.            3.07pm   National Grid avoids triggering emergency blackout plan  Good news: National Grid no longer expects to activate its emergency winter plan tomorrow. The UK electricity network operator has told the industry that \u201cthere is no longer considered to be a requirement for DFS\u201d (its \u201cdemand flexibility service\u201d). That means households and businesses won\u2019t be asked to cut their power demand tomorrow to avert power cuts.   As we reported earlier, the DFS is designed to reduce household consumption when supply is tight, by rewarding businesses and households that shift their power usage away from times of peak demand. The plan to trigger the DFS has been cancelled, as the Grid now believes it has enough power to keep systems running. This means households should be free to watch the World Cup, with England and Wales playing their final group game at 7pm GMT (other TV broadcasts are available, power permitting\u2026.)     2.47pm   BT and unions reach pay agreement  Peace is breaking out at BT, as the telco group announces a \u201cUK Cost of Living Pay Rise\u201d that could end strikes at the company. BT is offering a \u00a31,500 pay rise to all staff who earn less than \u00a350,000 year. The consolidated salary increase would be paid to all frontline BT staff, and 51% of managers in the UK.  When added to BT\u2019s earlier pay increase, it means the lowest paid would receive a pay rise of over 15% this year. Significantly, BT says that the CWU and Prospect unions will run consultative ballots recommending people vote in favour. If CWU members vote in favour, it would end the first national strike at BT in 35 years. BT adds that its 2023 pay review has been moved to next September, and will take into account the January Cost of Living Pay Rise. BT CEO Philip Jansen was in conciliatory mood, saying:  \u201cThis award is based on the principles we have followed throughout this difficult period. It gets help to as many of our colleagues as possible; favours our lower paid colleagues; and gives people the security of a built-in, pensionable increase to their pay. \u201cCrucially, it has been worked on in conjunction with the CWU. As I\u2019ve said throughout, whatever our differences, our unions are vital partners.        2.34pm     Wall Street has opened in the red, as the escalating anti-Covid lockdown protests in China fuel concerns over economic growth. The S&amp;P 500 index of US stocks has dropped by 0.7%, or 28 points, to 3,998 points. Apple shares are down almost 2%, on reports that the disruption at its China factory could create a production shortfall of around six million iPhone Pros Joshua Raymond, director at online investment platform XTB.com says the protests in China are worrying investors, for two reasons:  First, they are likely to be met with stricter rules and measures to curtail the length and spread of protests which might mean further restrictions to activity and therefore demand. Secondly, the unusually large and broad protests are signs of cracks appearing in Xi Jinping\u2019s dominance, which can mean longer term instability. Both factors create uncertainty in demand for commodities such as Oil and this is why we\u2019ve seen investors start the week in \u2018risk=off\u2019 moods by selling stocks and moving investments into safer havens such as the Japanese Yen.\u201d      2.21pm   Lagarde: Economic growth is slowing rapidly  The eurozone\u2019s top central banker, Christine Lagarde, has warned that European growth is slowing rapidly. But the ECB president also kept her options open as to the size and number of the ECB\u2019s future interest rate hikes \u2013 saying the pace of tightening will depend on several variables. She told the European Parliament that:  \u201cHow much further we need to go, and how fast we need to get there, will be based on our updated outlook, the persistence of the shocks, the reaction of wages and inflation expectations, and on our assessment of the transmission of our policy stance.\u201d        1.46pm    Business leaders in northern England have warned the Transport Secretary there is a \u201ccrisis on our rail network\u201d. Members of the Northern Powerhouse Partnership have written to Mark Harper warning that a \u201cwave of cancellations is wreaking havoc on the Northern economy\u201d.      1.45pm    Rolls-Royce has said it has run an aircraft engine on hydrogen in what is thought to be a world first for the aviation industry, which is considering using the fuel to decarbonise air travel. The FTSE 100 engineering company said the ground test was a \u201cmajor step towards proving that hydrogen could be a zero-carbon aviation fuel of the future\u201d, in a joint project with the airline easyJet. The test took place outdoors at Boscombe Down, a British military facility in Wiltshire. It used a converted Rolls-Royce AE 2100-A regional aircraft engine that is generally used to power turboprop planes. Turboprop engines are used to drive a propeller on slower-speed short-haul flights, rather than driving the fan required for faster speeds in jet engines. Building and maintaining jet engines is Rolls-Royce\u2019s main business line.  Here\u2019s the full story:      1.32pm    The WTO\u2019s gloomy outlook will only add to the pessimism in markets. After a grim 2022, investors fear 2023 could also be choppy as economies are dragged close to, or into, recession.       1.20pm   WTO: World trade is weakening  Global trade growth is slowing, as export orders weaken and demand for container shipments and air freight drops. The goods barometer calculated by the World Trade Organisation has sunk below its trend levels, in another signal that the global economy is weakening. It has slipped to 96.2, down from 100.0, reflecting cooling demand for traded goods. The WTO fears that trade growth is likely to slow in the closing months of 2022 and into 2023, \u201cas the global economy continues to be buffeted by strong headwinds\u201d.  The report found falling export orders, and weaker demand for air freight and electronic components. The WTO adds:  World merchandise trade volume growth continued to slow in the second quarter of 2022, with a 4.7% year\u2010on\u2010year increase similar to the 4.8% rise in the first quarter. According to the WTO\u2019s latest forecast, world trade is expected to decelerate further in the second half of 2022 and remain subdued in 2023 due to several related shocks, including the war in Ukraine, high energy prices, inflation, and monetary tightening in major economies.   Shipping giant Maersk warned at the start of this month that \u201cfreight rates have peaked\u201d as global demand weakened.      1.02pm    The finance boss of car dealership giant Inchcape has quit, after his \u201cpersonal behaviour\u201d fell below expected standards. Gijsbert de Zoeten, Inchcape\u2019s chief financial officer, has voluntarily tendered his resignation, and will be standing down from the Board with immediate effect.  In a statement to the City, Inchcape explained:  This follows an incident at a recent event where, through a lapse in judgement, he displayed personal behaviour falling short of the high standards expected of the leadership of the Group.  Inchcape insisted that de Zoeten\u2019s departure was unrelated to the company\u2019s financial performance or strategic direction, including its acquisition of Derco, the largest automotive distributor in Latin America.      12.54pm    Savers will see the rate on a fixed-rate account jump from 1% to 5% from December, HSBC UK has announced. The rate on HSBC\u2019s Regular Saver account is fixed for 12 months from the time of opening the account, under the bank\u2019s terms But HSBC UK announced on Monday that from December 1, it will increase the rate from 1% to 5%, and the rise will apply automatically to existing accounts. Interest accrued up to this date will be at the rate offered when the account was opened. Tom Wolfenden, HSBC UK\u2019s head of retail, said:   \u201cThe rate is fixed for the year from the time of opening, however at this time to help with the increased cost of living and to support those who currently have a Regular Saver open, we are increasing all current Regular Saver accounts to the new rate of 5% with effect from December 1. \u201cCustomers do not need to do anything, it will be updated automatically.\u201d   UK interest rates have risen from just 0.25% at the start of the year to 3%, but banks have been criticised for being slow to lift savings rates in response. Lenders are also under fire for not cutting mortgage rates quickly after turmoil in the UK bond market eased, having moved swiftly to raise them when the panic began.     12.35pm   National Grid poised to start emergency winter plan as energy prices soar  The UK electricity network operator is poised to activate its emergency winter plan after energy prices rose amid falling temperatures and amid growing concern over power supplies, our energy correspondent Alex Lawson reports. National Grid indicated that it could announce on Monday afternoon that it was issuing a requirement for consumers to use its new demand flexibility service from Tuesday, which rewards businesses and households that shift their power usage away from times of peak demand. Energy specialists are concerned that Britain\u2019s power systems could be threatened by lower temperatures, which increase demand; still weather reducing wind power and the slow return of a series of French nuclear reactors, which have been out of action due to maintenance. The Met Office issued yellow bad weather warnings over the weekend and some forecasters have suggested cold weather over Russia could hit the UK next month, in an echo of the \u201cbeast from the east\u201d snow storms which hit the UK in 2018. Gas and electricity prices surged on Monday morning as a result of the cold snap and forecast of worse to come. The price of gas for next-day delivery rose to 260p, up from 153p when markets closed on Friday night. Here\u2019s the full story:      12.34pm    The CBI\u2019s retail sales survey (see here) also highighted that shops have been hiking prices over the last year. It found:  Selling prices rose extremely quickly in the year to November, at a pace just shy of the 37-year high recorded in the previous quarterly survey (+82% from +87% in August). Prices are expected to increase at a broadly similar pace next month (+81%). Elsewhere, wholesale sales volumes fell considerably in the year to November (-18% from +3% in October), with a broadly similar pace of decline expected next month (-21%).  Motor retailers also reported a sharp fall in sales, with further declines feared in December.      12.23pm   UK property demand falls after mini-budget rocked markets.  Demand for UK houses has also weakened, after the disastrous mini-budget drove up mortgage costs. Property website Zoopla has reported today that demand for U.K. residential properties nearly halved year-on-year in the four weeks to November 20th, with net sales down 28%. People selling their homes have typically had to settle for below the asking price in recent weeks, according to Zoopla, which is predicting house prices will fall by about 5% next year. Here\u2019s the full story:   And here\u2019s some reaction:       12.00pm    Back in the markets\u2026grain, wheat and soybean prices are falling on concerns that China\u2019s Covid-19 outbreaks, and escalating protests, will hit its economic recovery. Wheat is down 0.9% to its lowest level in around three months, while soybean prices are 0.4% lower, and corn is off 0.5%. Matt Ammermann, StoneX commodity risk manage, explained:  \u201cThe news from China of more COVID cases and the unexpected protests against the government are weakening wheat, corn and soybeans today.  \u201cThere is concern in commodity markets both about the possible disruption in China from more anti-COVID measures and also the impact of protests.\u201d      11.56am    Strike news: Workers in seven train companies are to vote on whether they want to continue taking industrial action in a long-running dispute over jobs, pay and conditions. The Transport Salaried Staffs\u2019 Association (TSSA) is balloting more than 1,600 operational, station, control and management staff, for strike action and action short of strike. Ballots will be held throughout December with results due just before Christmas. The companies being re-balloted are Avanti West Coast, CrossCountry, East Midlands Railway, LNER, Northern, Southeastern and Transpennine Express (TPE).     11.40am   National Grid could activate emergency winter plan to avoid blackouts  UK households might be paid to help Britain\u2019s grid operator avoid a potential blackout on Tuesday evening, partly due to problems in the French energy grid and a drop in wind power. National Grid\u2019s electricity systems operator division said it is considering whether to activate a live run of its demand flexibility service for the first time on Tuesday. The scheme, which launched at the start of this month, has already been tested twice in the last two weeks but has not yet been run for a live event.  National Grid said it would decide by around 2.30pm today whether to issue the notice to suppliers and households. Electricity demand is rising as European temperatures fall, while weak wind speeds are hitting renewable energy supplies.    Updated at 11.44am GMT    11.10am   UK retail sales slide as pessimism mounts  Just in: UK retail sales weakened sharply this month as the economy weakened. Retailers reported that demand fell this month, with stores bracing for a difficult December as consumers are hit by the cost-of-living crisis. Expectations for sales in the coming month also weakened, to the weakest since March 2021, the CBI\u2019s latest \u2018distributive trades\u2019 survey of UK retail shows. Retailers are also cutting jobs \u2013 and expect to keep lowering their headcount next month. That\u2019s a sign of pessimism, as retailers fear that spending this Christmas will be weaker than last year. Here are the key findings:  Retail sales declined in the year to November (-19% from +18% in October) with a broadly similar fall expected next month (-21%). Sales volumes were seen as average for the time of year (+3% from +20% in October) and are expected to remain broadly in line with seasonal norms in December (-1%). Online retail sales contracted in the year to November (-5% from -23% in October). Internet sales have now been flat or falling for 13 months, and an accelerated contraction (-26%) is expected next month. Retailers remained notably pessimistic about the business situation over the next three months (-22%), to a similar extent to August (-22%). Employment growth in retail slumped in the year to November (-17% from +13% in August) \u2013 the first decline in headcount since August 2021. A further fall (-12%) is anticipated next month. Retailers expect to reduce investment in the next 12 months compared to the previous 12 (-38% from -31% in August), to the greatest extent since May 2020.   Martin Sartorius, principal economist at the CBI, says retailers are facing a tough time.  \u201cIt\u2019s not surprising that retailers are feeling the chill as the UK continues to be buffeted by economic headwinds. Sales volumes fell at a firm pace in the year to November, and retailers remain notably downbeat about their future business prospects. This pessimism is reflected in investment intentions worsening to the greatest extent since May 2020.   Updated at 11.28am GMT    10.56am    Barclays\u2019 chief executive, CS Venkatakrishnan, has been diagnosed with non-Hodgkin lymphoma, the bank has announced. Venkatakrishnan will be undergoing treatment for the next 12 to 16 weeks. In a letter to staff, Venkatakrishnan explained that \u201cthe good news is that the matter has been detected early\u201d, with scans and biopsies confirming it to be very localised. Venkatakrishnan, who was described as unflappable and popular with staff when he was appointed as CEO a year ago, wrote:  The doctors have advised that my prognosis is excellent, and my condition is curable with their prescribed regimen.  During this period, the company will run normally, and I will continue to be actively engaged in managing it. However, I will have to work from home for some periods and not be able to travel. Fortunately, I have always exercised regularly and am strong and fit as I commence this treatment.    Very best wishes for a speedy recovery, Venkat.     10.43am   XM: Market nervous about protests  The outlook for oil has worsened today, sending crude down around 3%. Investors are worried that authorities will clamp down hard against the protesters in China, and tighten restrictions even more, with daily infections at daily highs.  Raffi Boyadjian, lead investment analyst at XM, explains:  Risk assets took a knock at the start of the week as worries about instability in China and how the country\u2019s unyielding zero-Covid policy might further blight the outlook led investors to search for safety. Anti-lockdown protests started spreading after a deadly fire in Xinjiang last Thursday where residents were reportedly unable to escape the residential complex due to the harsh Covid restrictions. But the protests erupted further over the weekend, turning into nationwide demonstrations against the government\u2019s handling of the pandemic as anger boiled over. It is yet unclear how authorities plan to quell the ever-growing unrest given their unprecedented scale, or just how much more widespread these protests will become. But this is uncharted territory for President Xi Jinping and the Communist Party, and it is making the markets nervous.      10.22am    The US stock market is on track to open lower. The tech-focused Nasdaq futures contract is down 1.1%, while the S&amp;P 500 futures is off 0.9%.  The analyst team at Saxo Bank say the unrest in China has rattled markets:  Dramatic scenes of widespread protests in China against Covid policies there have pulled sentiment lower, with US yields dipping to new local lows and crude oil prices pushing on cycle lows even after Friday\u2019s drop. The US dollar has firmed against most currencies, but the Japanese yen is stronger still as the fall in yields and energy prices support the currency. This is a sudden powerful new distraction for markets when this week was supposed to be about incoming US data.      10.12am   Worst day in a month for China stocks  China\u2019s stock market posted its worst one-day fall in a month today, as investors worried about the protests against Covid-19 restrictions. The CSI 300 shed 42 points to finish at 3,733 points, a two-week low. The selloff was led by \u2018academic and educational services\u2019, property companies, financial companies and miners. A U.S. crackdown on Chinese tech giants citing national security concerns also weighed on shares of technology firms, Reuters points out. Gary Ng, economist at Natixis, says:  \u201cThe market does not like uncertainties that are difficult to price and the China protests clearly fall into this category. It means investors will become more risk-averse.\u201d  The CSI 300 is down 25% this year, caught up in the global selloff     9.58am    The gold price has nudged higher, up around $5 to $1,761 per ounce. Rupert Rowling, market analyst at Kinesis Money, says bullion is popular as a safe-haven today:  Gold has been lifted by market jitters as a result of the protests in China about continuing lockdown restrictions. With equities down, gold has climbed back to around $1,760 an ounce as investors seek out the precious metal as a haven.       9.37am    The cost of insuring China\u2019s debt against default has risen a little today. China five-year credit default swaps have risen by 6 basis points to 79bps, according to S&amp;P Global Markets intelligence. That\u2019s still low (showing the debt is seen as safe), but it shows rising edginess in the markets.     9.28am    Europe\u2019s oil and gas share index is down almost 2%, on worries that demand from China could weaken. AJ Bell investment director Russ Mould explains:  \u201cChina is a rapacious consumer of global commodities and signs economic activity is being disrupted by the mounting dissent in the country will be seen as negative for demand. It\u2019s worth noting that unrest is already affecting business in China including Apple which has seen violent clashes at one of its facilities in Zhengzhou. \u201cIn the medium term the protests could be positive for growth if they persuade Beijing to adopt a looser approach to Covid but given how strident Xi Jinping has been in pursuing the hard-line policy, it\u2019s difficult to see it being surrendered easily. \u201cPart of the problem for China is vaccination levels are behind those seen in other parts of the world and this means a \u2018living with the virus\u2019 strategy comes with substantial risks attached.\u201d      9.15am   Apple \"to lose 6 million iPhone Pros\" from China tumult   Bloomberg are reporting that the turmoil at Apple\u2019s key manufacturing hub of Zhengzhou could create a production shortfall of close to 6 million iPhone Pro units this year They say:  The situation remains fluid at the plant and the estimate of lost production could change, the person said, asking not to be named discussing private information. Much will depend on how quickly Foxconn Technology Group, the Taiwanese company that operates the facility, can get people back to assembly lines after violent protests against Covid restrictions. If lockdowns continue in the weeks ahead, production could be set further back. The Zhengzhou campus has been wracked by lockdowns and worker unrest for weeks after Covid infections left Foxconn and the local government struggling to contain the outbreak. Thousands of staff fled in October after chronic food shortages, only to be replaced by new employees who rebelled against pay and quarantine practices.    Videos fro Zhengzhou have shown police in China beating workers who protesting over working conditions and pay at the iPhone factory. More here:  Shares in Apple are down around 1.4% in premarket.      9.06am    Martin Petch, vice president at Moody\u2019s Investors Service, has said the ratings agency expected the protests in China \u201cto dissipate relatively quickly and without resulting in serious political violence\u201d. But he cautioned:  \u201cHowever, they have the potential to be credit negative if they are sustained and produce a more forceful response by the authorities.\u201d      8.54am   Market Report: Chinese protests send waves of unease across financial markets   The \u201cunprecedented waves of protest in China\u201d have caused ripples of unease across financial markets, explains Susannah Streeter, senior investment and markets analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown. Worries are mounting about the repercussions for the world\u2019s second-largest economy, she explains:  As demonstrations spread across the country from Beijing to Xinjiang and Shanghai, reflecting rising anger about the zero-Covid policy, a sustained recovery in demand across the vast country appears even further away. This has piled fresh downwards pressure on the oil price, with Brent Crude dropping to $81 a barrel, the lowest level since early January.  Already pockets of violence have erupted as police forces push back at protestors, but there are expectations that a much more stringent security clampdown will be ordered. This is all dashing hopes of an easing of restrictions, given that Xi JinPing will not want to look like he\u2019s backing down in the face of protests.      8.38am   Yuan falls to two-week low  China\u2019s yuan has fallen to the lowest in over two weeks against the US dollar. The onshore yuan has closed at 7.1999 to the dollar, the lowest in over two weeks. That shows investors are worried how Beijing would react to the wave of protests, at a time when Covid-19 cases are rising at record speed. Chris Weston, head of research at brokerage Pepperstone, explained:  We\u2019re really looking at the government response to what\u2019s happening ... the government response is so unpredictable, and of course that just means derisking.       8.33am    The drop in the oil price gives G7 nations an opportunity to tighten the financial pressure on Vladimir Putin. So argues Robin Brooks, chief economist at the Institute of International Finance:      8.28am    European stock markets have also opened lower:      8.24am   FTSE 100 index drops at the open  Britain\u2019s blue-chip share index has fallen half a percent at the start of trading. The FTSE 100 index has shed 39 points to 7447 points, falling back from last week\u2019s two-month highs. Oil giants BP (-2%) and Shell (-1.8) are among the top fallers, along with Asia-Pacific focused financial firms HSBC (-1.3%) and Standard Chartered (-1.6%). Mining giants are also in the red, tracking the drop in iron ore and copper prices.     8.21am    The economic and market headwinds hitting China are unlikely to abate significantly over the coming months, warns Mark Haefele, chief investment officer at UBS Global Wealth Management. He predicts Beijing policymakers will focus on stabilizing the economy, rather than spurring growth, adding:  Rising COVID-19 infections remain a significant drag on growth. Support for the property sector looks sufficient to limit the damage but may not spur faster growth. A widening of infections could add to supply chain interruptions, with China\u2019s problems spilling into global markets.      8.20am   Commodities sink as China's Covid outbreak worsens   Other commodity prices are also sinking this morning, amid fears over China\u2019s worsening virus situation and the series of protests in several cities. Iron ore futures in Singapore slumped more than 3% at one stage today, while Chinese copper futures declined as much as 1.8%. Traders are concerned that China\u2019s economic growth could be derailed, as infections rise at a record pace and more lockdowns are imposed. That would sap demand for energy, food and raw materials. As Bloomberg points out:  A return to stricter lockdowns would further squeeze demand for a number of key commodities. China is the largest importer of everything from oil to iron ore and soybeans, and purchases have already slowed this year as the economy has stumbled.       7.58am   Brent crude oil hits lowest since January  Brent crude, the oil benchmark, has fallen almost 3% to its lowest level since January. as China\u2019s Covid protests fuel demand fears. Brent is trading at $81.48 per barrel, while US crude is below $75/barrel for the first time in around 11 months.  Politcl uncertainty and the surge in Covid-19 cases in China are both weighing on the oil price, which is a bellwether of growth prospects. Naeem Alsam, chief market analyst at Avatrade, says:  Basically, it is demand that is creating the main issue for the price, and the fact that we have a potential recession threat and now the covid issues in China, things are becoming difficult for oil traders The reality is that no one wants to see more lockdowns in China, as a situation like this creates nothing but more headwinds for oil prices.      7.49am   Full story: Clashes in Shanghai as protests over zero-Covid policy grip China  The wave of civil disobedience \u2013- triggered by a deadly apartment fire in the far west of the country last week \u2013- is unprecedented in mainland China in the past decade.  My colleagues Helen Davidson and Verna Yu report:  In the early hours of Monday in Beijing, two groups of protesters totalling at least 1,000 people were gathered along the Chinese capital\u2019s 3rd Ring Road near the Liangma River, refusing to disperse. On Sunday in Shanghai, police kept a heavy presence on Wulumuqi Road, which is named after Urumqi, and where a candlelight vigil the day before turned into protests. \u201cWe just want our basic human rights. We can\u2019t leave our homes without getting a test. It was the accident in Xinjiang that pushed people too far,\u201d said a 26-year-old protester in Shanghai who declined to be identified.    Updated at 7.52am GMT    7.43am   Introduction: Oil and stocks hit by China protests   Good morning and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the financial markets and the world economy. Global stock markets are on edge as the protests intensify at major Chinese cities against the country\u2019s stringent zero-Covid rules. Stocks have fallen across Asia-Pacific markets, while oil has dropped to a near 11-month low, as public demonstrations in cities including Shanghai, Beijing, Chengdu, Wuhan and Guangzhou pose a growing challenge to president Xi\u2019s zero covid policies. China\u2019s CSI 300 share index fell sharply in early trading, before closing down over 1%. Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng is down 1.3% in late trading.  European markets are set to open lower.  On Sunday, hundreds of demonstrators and police have clashed in Shanghai, as frustration mounts nearly three years into the pandemic. The record rise in Covid-19 cases has added to public anger, explains Victoria Scholar, Head of Investment, at interactive investor:  \u201cRare protests have broken out across major Chinese cities in a backlash against the ongoing draconian zero-tolerance to Covid approach from the authorities that has inhibited the freedoms of Chinese citizens since the start of 2020 and that has sharply damaged China\u2019s economic growth. As a result, international investors have become a lot more cautious towards China with the unrest weighing on the Shanghai Composite, the Hang Seng Index and the Chinese yuan in today\u2019s trade. In mid-November China reduced its quarantine time for international travel by two days, suggesting that Beijing was finally starting to ease its strict lockdown measures and helping to lift travel and casino stocks amid optimism towards the potential economic reopening. However that optimism has faded fast with China recording another record high level of covid infections on Monday, adding to the sense of frustration after this weekend\u2019s protests.   With optimism about China\u2019s recovery taking a knock, investors are selling out of stocks and oil in favour of safe havens such as dollar, yen and Treasuries. Stephen Innes, managing partner at SPI Asset Management, explains:  It certainly doesn\u2019t help when many are confined to their apartments watching the World Cup, saw thousands of mask-less fans in Qatar enjoying life that has long been lost in COVID zero haze. Social discontent could increase in China over the coming months testing policymakers\u2019 resolve to stick to the COVID zero mandates. And since China\u2019s economy is currently in a tug-of-war between weakening macroeconomic fundamentals and increasing reopening hopes. Mass protests would deeply tilt the scales in favour of an even weaker economy and likely be accompanied by a massive surge in Covid cases, leaving policymakers with a considerable dilemma.

                    "body": "Nahed Araf Imran and her husband Jamal were exhausted but excited on Wednesday morning: Nahed was in labour with their third child at a local hospital in Nablus, in the north of the occupied West Bank. But when Jamal\u2019s mother arrived at the hospital crying just before the couple\u2019s daughter was born, he knew something was wrong. \u201cI asked her what happened and she told me that Shireen Abu Aqleh had been shot dead by the Israelis. Shireen had visited us in our town, Bureen, and covered demonstrations here many times. Everybody knows her,\u201d the 29-year-old construction worker said. \u201cMy mum was heartbroken. I said to myself, when the baby comes, we will call her Shireen, and my wife agreed.\u201d Shireen Abu Aqleh Jamal Imran came into the world at about noon on Wednesday. At dawn that morning, her namesake, a 51-year-old veteran Al Jazeera journalist, had been shot in the head and killed during an Israel Defence Forces (IDF) raid in the West Bank town of Jenin. Israeli officials said they believed the dual Palestinian-American citizen had died after being hit by Palestinian fire during an altercation between IDF soldiers and Palestinian gunmen. But the reporter\u2019s colleagues at the scene said there were no militants near the small group of journalists \u2013 all wearing helmets and body armour clearly marked as \u201cpress\u201d \u2013 when they came under fire from the direction of the Israeli unit. Ali Samodi, an Al Jazeera producer who was shot in the back, told the Observer from his hospital bed that even after Abu Aqleh had fallen to the ground and colleagues tried to reach her, the bullets kept coming. Video of the incident confirms this version of events.  Israel has firmly rejected allegations that its soldiers deliberately targeted the journalists, but the international community is demanding answers in what Al Jazeera, the Qatar-based TV network, has described as an \u201cassassination\u201d carried out \u201cin cold blood\u201d. Unlike the killings of anonymous Palestinians that occur in the occupied West Bank on a regular basis, Abu Aqleh was a familiar face, broadcasting to millions across the Arab world and well known for her bravery during a 15-year television news career. She was also a US citizen. This time, an Israeli strategy of deflection and denial has backfired. What is seen by the Palestinians as Israeli obfuscation also threatens to inflame a spate of violence that has surged across Israel and the Palestinian territories since late March. A video released by the IDF of what it said were Palestinian militants engaged in a firefight in Jenin on the morning Abu Aqleh was killed has been heavily criticised: human rights group B\u2019Tselem, which visited the two locations, found it was impossible for the shooting in the IDF-distributed video to be the same gunfire that hit Abu Aqleh and Samodi. And the spectacle of Israeli police storming Abu Aqleh\u2019s funeral procession in Jerusalem on Friday, causing pallbearers to drop her coffin, has added to Palestinian and international outrage. The public display of Palestinian flags in occupied East Jerusalem is forbidden by the Israeli authorities under any circumstances, but many mourners arrived waving Palestinian banners. The journalist\u2019s casket was also draped in the flag, followed by an orange stretcher bearing a flak jacket marked \u201cpress\u201d.  The EU said it was appalled by the \u201cunnecessary\u201d force used by the Israeli police, while the White House described footage of the scene as \u201cdeeply disturbing\u201d.  Israel\u2019s police said the mourners were \u201cdisrupting public order\u201d by throwing stones at the heavy police presence, but on Saturday said an investigation into the officers\u2019 actions would be launched. \u201cI was horrified by what I saw on TV from the funeral. I think it shows how Shireen exposed [Israel], she succeeded in that not just in life but in death also,\u201d Imran said. Not letting her funeral proceed with respect \u2026 they have publicly exposed themselves for the world to see.\u201d The battle of narratives sparked by Abu Aqleh\u2019s death is far from over. Palestinian officials have rejected the Israeli offer of a joint investigation, saying \u201ccriminals cannot be trusted\u201d, leading Israeli prime minister Naftali Bennett to accuse the Palestinians of denying Israel \u201caccess to the basic findings required to get to the truth\u201d. Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas said during a state memorial for Abu Aqleh in the Palestinian town of Ramallah on Thursday that the case will be referred to the international criminal court, of which Israel is not a member and whose jurisdiction the state disputes. An interim Israeli army investigation \u201ccould not determine\u201d who fired the fatal bullet, an IDF statement said on Friday, while an initial probe by the Palestinian public prosecution found that \u201cthe only origin of the shooting was the Israeli occupation forces\u201d. In the meantime, even more so than during her career, Abu Aqleh\u2019s fame has grown. Outside the reporter\u2019s home in Beit Hanina in East Jerusalem this week, neighbours and friends gathered daily to mourn her death despite a raid on the house on Wednesday by Israeli forces: many have put up pictures of her in their windows. On the quiet street outside, local children gather waving Palestinian flags. \u201cShireen was a Christian and we are a Muslim family, but that didn\u2019t matter,\u201d one neighbour said. \u201cShe has united us.\u201d For the thousands of people who have thronged streets across the West Bank and Jerusalem this week in tribute, Abu Aqleh\u2019s life and death has become a potent symbol. \u201cShireen\u2019s story is the story of the Palestinian people,\u201d said Imran, the father of newborn Shireen. \u201cShe will never be forgotten, especially for our family. Every time we call her name we will remember.\u201d"

It is difficult to find what I have here as a manager. To be a manager for a long time you need to be so supported. The results help a lot; that is undeniable.  \u201cIn this world they sack you, they fire you, we know that. But at big clubs the part of the success of the manager is the chairman, the sporting director especially, and all the people here. It [this support] goes to the media, fans and players. It shows stability. This is why I think only in a few clubs this can happen.\u201d Asked whether he would discuss a new contract when taking a break during the World Cup, Guardiola said: \u201cI don\u2019t talk about that. Everything is under control, it\u2019s perfect, the decision will be made together with the club the moment it has to be made. I said many times, I had the feeling that both the club and myself are happy to be together. \u201cIt\u2019s not the moment [for this]. Brentford is the only important thing right now. When we have time, when we feel it is the right moment, both sides, we take a decision.\u201d Guardiola was clear regarding what still motivates him at City after claiming nine major trophies since taking over in 2016. \u201cHaving fun,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are stressful moments and bad moments \u2013 it\u2019s not all the time that you win, all the time you\u2019re happy and all the time it works like you\u2019re thinking [hoping].

At a meeting of the F1 Commission in London on Tuesday there was also no concrete decision regarding whether the budget cap would be increased this year. The F1 commission consists of representatives of F1\u2019s owners \u2013 Formula One management, the FIA and the teams. F1 and the teams supported increasing the number of sprint race weekends to be held from the three this year to six next year, with FOM believing the format to be very successful.  However, the FIA has insisted it will not back the plan until it has carried out an evaluation of the impact of the proposal on its trackside operations and personnel. The FIA will then report back to the commission and once more consider the proposal. Reports have suggested the FIA was seeking to receive greater financial redress from F1 in return for agreeing to increase the sprint races. The meeting also discussed the proposed budget cap increase from $140m (\u00a3111m) to $147m this year to cover increased freight and logistic costs and inflation, a move that was known to be opposed by three teams. The matter has not been resolved and instead been handed to the F1 financial working group which will investigate the issues involved and also present its findings at the next meeting of the commission. There was, however, agreement that, in accordance with the new engine rule set to come into play in 2026, the cars would have to adapt accordingly. The new engines are aimed at environmental sustainability \u2013 including an increase in the deployment of electrical power to up to 50% and to utilise a 100% sustainable fuel. There was agreement that, with a potential loss in horsepower from the new power units, the cars needed to be smaller and lighter and that ways must be considered to reduce their drag while maintaining recent improvements in their ability to follow one another closely on track. The use of helmet cameras was given unanimous approval after their initial tests and they will be employed across the entire grid in 2023. There was no announcement on which race will replace the Russian Grand Prix but Qatar remains an option or potentially a second race in Singapore."

                    "body": "Emma Hayes has described the Chelsea captain, Magda Eriksson, as \u201ca main reason we\u2019ve been a winning team for years\u201d and praised her influence on her return from three months out to help navigate Chelsea to a third consecutive league title and Sunday\u2019s FA Cup final against Manchester City. Eriksson suffered an ankle injury during Chelsea\u2019s 4-0 Champions League defeat to Wolfsburg in December, ruling her out of action for a significant part of the season. \u201cWe knew it was an injury that was going to take a bit of time,\u201d says Hayes. \u201cNaturally, the team was going to lose something. In Aniek [Nouwen] we have a player that doesn\u2019t have the experience but stepped into a space that helped develop the team in some different ways. However, Magda\u2019s our captain for a reason.\u201d  When Eriksson was fit again in March Hayes was reluctant to put her straight back into a team on a winning streak, despite her quality. \u201cI really rate and respect Magda but we had conversations around being patient and I knew that moment would come. Neither of us thought that would be when we went down to 10 players at Tottenham. \u201cHaving Magda\u2019s leadership back on the pitch, and I don\u2019t want to take anything away from Millie [Bright] because Millie\u2019s been amazing, but having both of them together brings another dimension to us managing really tough moments. Particularly when the stress levels go up.\u201d Being out was \u201ca challenge\u201d, says Eriksson. \u201cIt was my first long injury in a very long time. It wasn\u2019t nice to be out for three months and not be part of the team. \u201cBut watching the team play and watching players grow in that period, every single player stepped up so that made me really proud. I was sad not to be part of it but it made me really proud to see how many younger girls in our team stepped up and really took that responsibility.\u201d Coming back into the Chelsea side was a test. \u201cYou want to be back where you left off but you have to respect that your body has gone through an injury and you have been out for three months. I have really high demands, so I had to try and be nice to myself.\u201d Being captain from the sidelines was a different role for the Sweden centre-back. \u201cIt\u2019s important to know when to take a step back and when to let the team figure it out themselves with their new roles,\u201d she says.  \u201cMillie had the armband and she did amazingly and the team performed really well. So I tried to mainly focus on my injury, getting myself right first, because that is important, you have to focus on yourself sometimes. But then I was always there if anyone needed a chat or anyone wanted to talk to someone who wasn\u2019t maybe involved in playing that much.\u201d Eriksson\u2019s absence was keenly felt for Chelsea in their 3-1 Continental League Cup final defeat to their FA Cup final opponents, Manchester City. \u201cThey\u2019re back now, they\u2019re back to their old self,\u201d says Eriksson, who is in touch with the Chelsea men\u2019s team captain, C\u00e9sar Azpilicueta, and said the two Chelsea teams would be cheering each other on.  Sign up to our new women\u2019s football newsletter!  \u201cTheir record lately has proven they look incredibly strong. They were strong against us as well in the Conti Cup final, we want to get revenge for that game. We know we can do better than that.\u201d The FA Cup final in 2018 was Eriksson\u2019s \u201cfirst real big game for Chelsea\u201d and the competition means a lot. \u201cThat\u2019s the game I will always remember, it\u2019s one of the coolest I\u2019ve ever experienced. I don\u2019t know how many were in the stands, but it was a lot of people and back then I wasn\u2019t used to playing in front of that many people and we\u2019re expecting an even bigger crowd on Sunday. The fans are amazing, and the history of the Cup is great. There\u2019s so many things that make you want to win it.\u201d"

                    "body": "Widening sanctions against Moscow could result in higher energy bills for a swathe of UK businesses if a key Russian-owned supplier is blacklisted, the UK\u2019s energy trade body has confirmed. Gazprom Energy, a subsidiary of Russia\u2019s state owned gas and oil giant, has been one of the largest suppliers of gas for UK businesses since 2010, according to energy consultancy Cornwall Insight, which said the firm accounts for about 20.8% of the market. While Downing Street has so far only imposed asset freezes on five Russian banks and three high net worth individuals as part of its retaliation over Moscow\u2019s threat to Ukraine, the UK has given itself powers to extend those sanctions to target other key industries including the energy sector. A larger package of UK sanctions against Moscow, which is being coordinated with the US and EU, will be implemented if a full-scale invasion of Ukraine takes place. That could impact companies such as Russia\u2019s state-owned gas giant Gazprom and subsidiaries such as Gazprom Energy, which provides gas and electricity to factories, businesses and public sector customers across the UK. According to its latest annual report, it supplied gas to 178,000 sites across the country in 2020. A subsidiary of Gazprom\u2019s marketing and trading arm, the gas it supplies to UK customers comes from a \u201cvariety of sources and countries\u201d including Norway and Qatar. The firm declined to confirm the proportion secured from Russia. The UK\u2019s energy trade body has warned that any further disruption to the supply during an existing crunch could spell trouble for customers. \u201cWith both domestic and business customers already facing steep bill increases as a result of record gas prices on the wholesale market, further disruption to the market and supplies would be a big concern if it increases prices further,\u201d a spokesperson for Energy UK said. Unlike domestic energy users, there is no price cap for business customers across the UK. Companies have suffered rising bills following a global gas supply crunch that emerged as economies began to rebound after the Covid-19 slump. Gazprom Energy first entered the UK market when it bought supplier Penine, which had just 600 customers at the time, in 2006. It did not confirm the number of UK business customers it currently serves, and declined to comment on the potential impact of UK sanctions. The gas supplier employs about 290 people at its head office in Manchester, according to its website. Its parent company is responsible for about 13% of global gas production. Although a further escalation of tensions between Russia and the west would have a far more significant impact in mainland Europe \u2013 including Germany where Russian gas imports account for 40% of the supply \u2013 it could also indirectly push up prices on the wholesale market. Economists warn this is likely to have a knock-on impact for British firms and households. Britain consumes about 74bn cubic metres of gas each year, or about 1,100 cubic metres per person, making it one of Europe\u2019s heaviest consumers per capita. About half is imported, mostly from Norway which supplies a third of UK gas.  Russia was the fourth largest market for UK gas imports in 2021 according to official figures from the Office for National Statistics. Ranked after Norway, Qatar and the US, Britain bought almost \u00a31bn of Russian gas, or about 4.9% of total UK imports. Speaking last month as tensions mounted, Will Webster, energy policy manager for the industry lobby group Oil and Gas UK, said: \u201cIf the Russians reduce deliveries of gas to Europe, then it has to come from somewhere else, most likely as shipments of liquefied natural gas. That will increase competition for supplies, driving up prices and consumer bills even more. Conversely, any additional gas we produce ourselves will help alleviate this process.\u201d Jamie Maddock, an equity research analyst at investment management firm Quilter Cheviot said the impact of potential sanctions on the wider gas market would depend on the \u201cseverity and breadth of any sanctions beyond what\u2019s already been announced, and then if it instils a response in Russia.\u201d \u201cSo far, the government\u2019s sanctions are focused on certain oligarchs within Putin\u2019s inner circle and various Russian banks,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is little impact on energy companies, Gazprom included, though this could well change.\u201d"

Hunt is expected to announce that plans to reduce the basic rate of income tax next April will be pushed back by a year.\nLong Covid could be contributing to labour shortages in the UK, the governor of the Bank of England has said. Andrew Bailey made the comments at a G30 seminar in Washington.\nBailey said he spoke to the new chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, yesterday and they had an \u201cimmediate meeting of minds\u201d. He said there was a \u201cvery clear and immediate meeting of minds between us about the importance of fiscal sustainability\u201d.\nIn his speech, Bailey said that inflationary pressures will need a \u201cstronger response\u201d than previously anticipated in August. He said the bank \u201dwill not hesitate\u201d to raise interest rates to meet the inflation target.\nThe chancellor has admitted that his medium-term fiscal plan to be unveiled on 31 October will in effect be a full budget. Jeremy Hunt told ITV\u2019s Robert Peston on Saturday that he would \u201cpretty much\u201d be delivering a \u201cproper\u201d budget.\nKeir Starmer has accused Liz Truss of \u201cgrotesque chaos\u201d, referencing Neil Kinnock\u2019s famous 1985 conference speech. Speaking in Barnsley, an area where he said Labour would have to win 14 battleground seats, he referenced the \u201cgrotesque chaos of a Tory prime minister handing out redundancy notices to her own chancellor\u201d.\nActor Miriam Margolyes said she wanted to tell Jeremy Hunt \u201cFuck you, bastard\u201d after appearing on Radio 4 immediately after the new chancellor. She made the comments on the Today programme at the end of an interview about the death of Robbie Coltrane.\nJeremy Hunt said the PM wants him to be \u201ccompletely honest\u201d with the country and that there will be difficult decisions ahead. He refused to specify which departments, but he said he will require \u201call departments\u201d, including health, to make savings, and that some taxes will have to go up.\nHunt said the Liz Truss administration has made \u201cmistakes\u201d and that there are \u201cdifficult decisions ahead\u201d. He was speaking on Sky News.\nLabour has signalled it will be boycotting the World Cup in Qatar next month, citing the treatment of construction workers and the criminalisation of same-sex relationships.\n\n\nUpdated at 8.51pm BST\n\n\n 8.35pm  \n\nSenior Conservatives will this week hold talks on a \u201crescue mission\u201d that would see the swift removal of Liz Truss as leader, after the new chancellor Jeremy Hunt dramatically tore up her economic package and signalled a new era of austerity, writes Toby Helm and Michael Savage.\nA group of senior MPs will meet on Monday to discuss the prime minister\u2019s future, with some wanting her to resign within days and others saying she is now \u201cin office but not in control\u201d. Some are threatening to publicly call on Truss to stand down after the implosion of her tax-cutting programme.\nIn a rearguard action to prop up the prime minister, her cabinet allies tonight warned MPs they would precipitate an election and ensure the Tories were \u201cfinished as a party\u201d if they toppled a second leader in just a few months.\n\n\n\n\n 7.50pm  \n\nHealth chiefs, public sector unions and teaching leaders expressed horror after the new chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, appeared to usher in a fresh era of austerity, and the threat of more misery for cash-strapped hospitals and schools, writes Mark Townsend and Michael Savage.\nIn his first interviews since dramatically replacing Kwasi Kwarteng on Friday, Hunt provoked widespread alarm by promising \u201cvery difficult decisions\u201d for government budgets.\nThe NHS Confederation, which represents the healthcare system in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, warned the prospect of further cuts was \u201cincredibly grim\u201d.\nThe head of the largest teaching union for England and Wales denounced Hunt\u2019s attempt to placate the financial markets as \u201cdisastrous\u201d and \u201cscary\u201d for schools, while another teaching union, NASUWT, said deeper cuts would cause \u201cimmeasurable damage to children\u2019s learning\u201d.\nMeanwhile the GMB, which represents more than 500,00 public sector workers, said the Tories\u2019 decade of austerity from 2010 scarred the country and stagnated the economy, adding: \u201cThe British people are being used as lab rats in a terrible Tory economic experiment.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n 7.29pm  \n\nLabour has signalled it will be boycotting the World Cup in Qatar next month, citing the treatment of construction workers and the criminalisation of same-sex relationships.\nLucy Powell, the shadow culture secretary, said: \u201cOf course I am looking forward to the World Cup and I\u2019ll be cheering England on.\n\u201cBut we cannot avert our eyes from the problems in Qatar.\n\u201cDozens of construction workers have been killed putting this tournament on.\n\u201cAnd LGBT England and Wales fans are having to put up with the tournament being played in a country where their sexuality is criminalised.\n\u201cI\u2019m excited to cheer on the England team from my sitting room and from my local pub.\u201d\n\n\n\n 7.05pm  \n\n\nThe historic town of Downham Market in Liz Truss\u2019s South West Norfolk constituency should be a personal bulwark in political crisis and economic turmoil. This weekend, confidence in the prime minister in her own Conservative heartland was ebbing away.\n\nWhile officials in Downing Street contemplate whether Truss is now in her last days of office and MPs plot possible succession, the verdict on her record among the stalls, coffee bars and busy shopping streets of the market town was harsh.\nSitting in the town\u2019s Greggs bakery, Ian Bond, 74, a retired engineering manager who was born in Downham Market, said he considered the mini-budget \u201cBlack Friday\u201d for the Conservative party.\n\n\nUpdated at 7.20pm BST\n\n\n 6.50pm  \n\nThe Sunday Times is reporting that the PM\u2019s intermediaries contacted allies of Sajid Javid, the former chancellor, last week to gauge his appetite for a return to the Treasury to replace Kwasi Kwarteng.\nThe newspaper said Javid\u2019s conditions were too much for Liz Truss to accept.\n\u201cSajid would have only done it if he had complete control,\u201d one ally of Javid\u2019s said.\nThree sources said Javid had insisted on full autonomy over tax-and-spend policies, the freedom to appoint his own political team and the reinstatement of Sir Tom Scholar, the veteran Treasury permanent secretary who was unceremoniously sacked by Kwarteng and Truss on their first day in office.\n\n\n\n 6.28pm  \nChancellor to 'delay 1p income tax reduction'\n\nThe new chancellor Jeremy Hunt is set to delay a 1p cut in income tax to help plug a black hole in the public finances that had reached \u00a372 billion, according to the Sunday Times.\nHunt, who replaced Kwasi Kwarteng in the role yesterday, is expected to announce that plans to reduce the basic rate of income tax next April will be pushed back by a year.\nThe cut to 19 per cent will now take effect at the time previously proposed by Rishi Sunak, the former chancellor, who was Liz Truss\u2019s main leadership rival.\n\nUpdated at 6.28pm BST\n\n\n 6.15pm  \n\nCrossbench peer Lord Jim O\u2019Neill said he presumed there would not be many \u201ctensions\u201d between Jeremy Hunt and the Prime Minister, because otherwise the government is \u201cfinished\u201d.\nThe former chief economist at investment bank Goldman Sachs told BBC Radio 4\u2019s PM programme: \u201cI can\u2019t imagine how the Prime Minister could afford to lose him quickly if she wanted to stay on herself.\n\u201cSo in that sense, he\u2019s got a lot of influence but his dilemma is the backbenches of this peculiar era of the Conservative Party is just full of so many different factions and many of them will be put out by Jeremy\u2019s own history as evidenced by the fact he failed to become leader twice but also by what he implied now has to happen.\u201d\nHe added: \u201cI\u2019m making what might be a really naive assumption that he\u2019s only taken this job because he\u2019s been given carte blanche by a desperate prime minister.\u201d\n\nUpdated at 6.16pm BST\n\n\n 6.02pm  \n\nAstonishing as it may sound to someone who has not paid attention to politics since about 2016, after little more than a month in office, a consensus is building that Liz Truss could be finished as prime minister. \nBut who could succeed her as the Conservatives\u2019 fifth prime minister since 2016? Candidates include runner-up in the last contest Rishi Sunak, defence secretary Ben Wallace, and, of course, Truss\u2019s predecessor, Boris Johnson. \nRead the full story here: \n\n\n\n\n 5.51pm  \n\nKwasi Kwarteng argued against scrapping the top 45p rate of tax in last month\u2019s mini-budget but was overruled by Liz Truss, according to a report by the Mail on Sunday.\nThe paper said sources claimed Kwarteng wanted to wait until next year before introducing the measure for fear of \u201cdoing too much at once\u201d, but was told: \u201cNo, let\u2019s go for it.\u201d\nThe mini-budget, delivered on 23 September, shook market confidence in the long-term ability of the government to pay its debts, causing the pound to plummet and the cost of government borrowing to soar.\nThe scrapping of the 45p rate was among the package\u2019s most controversial measures.\nTruss sacked Kwarteng on Friday as part of an attempt to reassure the markets and calm unrest on her own backbenches.\nThe new chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, is due to deliver a fiscal statement on 31 October.\n\nUpdated at 5.55pm BST\n\n\n 5.28pm  \n\nMPs from across the Commons have been paying tribute to Sir David Amess on the anniversary of his murder.\nFormer home secretary Priti Patel said Sir David was an \u201coutstanding public servant full of kindness, energy and integrity\u201d who was killed in a \u201csenseless attack on democracy\u201d.\nSharing a photo of herself with Sir David, Conservative MP Alicia Kearns called him a \u201cwonderful friend\u201d and said \u201ca man so full of love and joy shall never be forgotten\u201d.\nLabour\u2019s Marsha de Cordova said she was remembering a \u201ckind, caring and dedicated public servant\u201d, while David Lammy called him a \u201cpolitician who cared deeply about his constituency, animal welfare and so many issues beyond\u201d.\nThe prime minister, Liz Truss, her predecessor, Boris Johnson, and the Labour leader, Sir Keir Starmer, have all also paid tribute.\n\n\nUpdated at 5.34pm BST\n\n\n 5.09pm  \n\nAlmost a fifth of all households in Britain will be spending more on housing costs by the end of 2024, analysis by the Resolution Foundation thinktank has found.\nThe group said the average mortgagor would be paying \u00a33,500 a year more in the fourth quarter of 2024 than they were in the third quarter of 2022, and that the additional spend would be \u00a326bn overall.\nIn London, the average additional spend rises to \u00a35,500.\nThe thinktank said that, by the end of 2024, more than 1.8 million mortgaged households will see housing costs take up at least 10% more of their household income.\nIt added that by the first quarter of 2027, almost no mortgaged households would be unaffected by the rise in rates.\nWriting on Twitter, Resolution Foundation chief executive Torsten Bell said the changes would be a \u201cmassive deal\u201d for the economy.\n\nUpdated at 5.15pm BST\n\n\n 4.45pm  \n\nLiz Truss\u2019s premiership now depends on the success of the financial statement due to be delivered on 31 October, one of her MPs has said.\nSir Geoffrey Clifton-Brown, treasurer of the backbench 1922 Committee, had it put to him by LBC that should the statement fail to restore market confidence in the government, Truss would have to go.\n\u201cI think that\u2019s exactly right,\u201d he said. \u201cI think a huge amount rests on that.\n\u201cIf that statement \u2013 and God forbid, I hope this won\u2019t be the case \u2013 doesn\u2019t manage to satisfy the markets and satisfy everybody else, and the economy\u2019s still in chaos, then I think we would be in a very difficult situation.\u201d\nHe added that he was not \u201canticipating that happening\u201d.\n\u201cI think [new chancellor] Jeremy Hunt is a man of sufficient calibre that he will come up with a solution that does command the confidence of the markets,\u201d he said.\n\u201cAnd let\u2019s hope, for the British people, \u2026 that does happen.\u201d\n\n\nUpdated at 4.51pm BST\n\n\n 4.23pm  \n\nNew analysis by the Trades Union Congress has found that payouts to shareholders have increased three times faster than workers\u2019 wages since the 2008 financial crash.\nShareholder handouts, through both dividends and companies buying back their own shares, have soared \u00a3440bn above inflation since 2008. Meanwhile, wages have fallen, growing \u00a3510bn less than inflation.\nThe TUC says the findings are evidence that firms do have the capacity for wage increases if they allow their workers a greater share of a business\u2019s wealth.\n\u201cToo many businesses are lining shareholders\u2019 pockets without giving workers a fair deal,\u201d said the TUC general secretary, Frances O\u2019Grady.\nRead the full story here:\n\n\nUpdated at 4.49pm BST\n\n\n 4.04pm  \nHere's a summary of the latest developments...\n\n\nLong Covid could be contributing to labour shortages in the UK, the governor of the Bank of England has said.

Thanks for reading.\n\nUpdated at 4.13pm BST\n\n\n 3.50pm  \n\nHere\u2019s the full story on Starmer speech this morning (see also 11.52am):\n\n\n\n\n 3.35pm  \nLong covid could be among factors affecting UK labour shortages, says Andrew Bailey\n\nLong covid could be contributing to labour shortages in the UK, the governor of the Bank of England has said.\nAndrew Bailey told a G30 seminar that labour shortages are largely being driven by an increase in older people choosing not to work, with possible reasons including long covid, people with long-term health conditions being reluctant to work during the pandemic, and public health systems not treating people as promptly in a covid environment.\nClimate change, he said, must be factored into \u201cour everyday business\u201d.\n\nUpdated at 3.55pm BST\n\n\n 3.24pm  \nBank of England governor says he had 'immediate meeting of minds' with new chancellor\n\nAndrew Bailey says he spoke to Jeremy Hunt yesterday and that they had an \u201cimmediate meeting of minds\u201d.\nDuring questions at a G30 seminar in Washington, Andrew Bailey said during their conversation there was a \u201cvery clear and immediate meeting of minds between us about the importance of fiscal sustainability\u201d.\nHunt, he said, is now working on his 31 October financial statement.\nBaily said that although he issued a statement on the Monday after the mini-budget, it is \u201cnot something I make a habit of doing\u201d.\nHe said the two most important factors on fiscal policy are the importance of sustainability and having the Office for Budget Responsibility involved.\nThe OBR, he said, is \u201cnow very much back in the picture\u201d.\n\nUpdated at 3.29pm BST\n\n\n 3.08pm  \n\nThe UK financial crisis is a punchline during questions at the G30.\n\nUpdated at 3.20pm BST\n\n\n 2.58pm  \nBank of England governor says in difficult times UK must be 'very clear' on its framework of intervention\n\nAndrew Bailey ends by saying that as the situation in the UK demonstrates, \u201cin these difficult times, we need to be very clear on this framework of intervention\u201d.\n\nThe MPC [monetary policy committee of the bank] is not using the stock of asset holdings as an active tool of monetary policy at present. As we have made clear over a number of years, once bank rate was away from the lower bound, and could move in both directions, the intention was to unwind the stock of QE gradually and predictably, and in a way that wasn\u2019t bound to underlying economic conditions. Instead, monetary conditions are now steered by bank rate, the primary instrument of policy. Should monetary conditions prove too loose to meet the inflation target, given the economic news, it\u2019s bank rate that responds. And whatever the source of any disturbance to monetary conditions, the MPC is free to offset those disturbances by means of its primary instrument, bank rate.\n\n\nUpdated at 3.21pm BST\n\n\n 2.53pm  \nUK financial markets experienced 'violent moves' in recent weeks, says Bank of England governor\n\nThe governor of the Bank of England tells the G30 that UK financial markets have experienced \u201csome violent moves in the last few weeks, particularly at the long-end of the government debt market\u201d.\nAndrew Bailey said:\n\nThis has put the spotlight on flaws in the strategy and structure of one important part of a lot of pension funds. The Bank of England has had to intervene to deal with a threat to the stability of the financial system, our other core objective.\n\n\n\nUpdated at 3.23pm BST\n\n\n 2.48pm  \n\nThe war in Ukraine has led to a \u201chuge negative shock to real income\u201d, affecting the most vulnerable and least well off most in the UK, says Bailey.\n\nFor us at the Bank of England, it has created a huge challenge for monetary policy. Inflation is well above its 2% target.\n\nHe describes the energy price cap as a \u201cmajor intervention\u201d but \u201cunderstandable\u201d.\n\nUpdated at 3.23pm BST\n\n\n 2.46pm  \n\nThe UK economy has been \u201cbuffeted by very large disturbances in the last two and a half years or so\u201d as a result of Covid, supply chain issues, a shrinking labour force and the war in Ukraine, he says, adding: \u201cThese disturbances are very large\u201d.\n\nIn the UK, the rise in energy prices means that household spending on energy as a share of income could plausibly be a full 2 percentage points higher this winter than in 2019. This is a bigger increase than we saw in the energy crises in the 1970s.\nThe disturbances that have come since Covid hit have been supply-side effects in the UK \u2013 supply chains, shrinkage of the labour force, cuts in the supply of natural gas to Europe as a whole. I want to draw out a number of points from this.\n\n\nUpdated at 3.24pm BST\n\n\n 2.43pm  \n\nAndrew Bailey is now at the podium \u2026\n\nUpdated at 3.24pm BST\n\n\n 2.42pm  \nBank of England governor to say inflationary pressures will need 'stronger response' than expected\n\nIn his speech, published ahead of time, Andrew Bailey is expected to say that inflationary pressures will need a \u201cstronger response\u201d than previously anticipated in August.\nThe governor of the Bank of England is expected to say in a few minutes:\n\nRecently, the UK government has made a number of fiscal announcements, and has set 31 October as the date for a further fiscal statement.\nThe MPC [monetary policy committee] will respond to all this news at its next meeting in just under three weeks from now. This is the correct sequence in my view.\nWe will know the full scope of fiscal policy by then. But I will repeat what we have said already. We will not hesitate to raise interest rates to meet the inflation target. And, as things stand today, my best guess is that inflationary pressures will require a stronger response than we perhaps thought in August.\n\n\nUpdated at 3.25pm BST\n\n\n 2.25pm  \n\nNeil Irwin, chief economic correspondent at Axios, comments: \u201cFor the record, you never want to be the central banker of the moment if at all possible.\u201d\n\nUpdated at 2.25pm BST\n\n\n 2.23pm  \n\nAndrew Bailey, the governor of the Bank of England, is about to speak at the G30 37th annual international banking seminar in Washington, DC. I\u2019ll be monitoring for interesting comments.\nHis speech in full has been published ahead of time by the Bank of England here.\nHe is introduced as the \u201ccentral banker of the moment\u201d to laughs from the audience.\n\nUpdated at 3.26pm BST\n\n\n 1.35pm  \n31 October fiscal plan will in effect be fully fledged budget, admits Hunt\n\nThe new chancellor has admitted that his medium-term fiscal plan to be unveiled on 31 October will in effect be a full budget.\nJeremy Hunt told ITV\u2019s Robert Peston on Saturday that he would \u201cpretty much\u201d be delivering a \u201cproper\u201d budget.\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to be talking about tax,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be talking about spending, we\u2019re going to be talking about medium- and long-term plans.\u201d\nThis morning, in a series of interviews, he refused to be drawn on specifics but said all departments, including health and defence, would be subject to spending cuts and refused to commit to raising benefits in line with inflation (more from earlier here).\n\n\nUpdated at 3.27pm BST\n\n\n 1.11pm  \n\nAnas Sarwar, the Scottish Labour leader, has said his party is ready for a general election, claiming Liz Truss is a \u201clame duck\u201d.\nHe told BBC Scotland\u2019s Good Morning Scotland that the party is \u201cnot afraid\u201d of an election and that Truss\u2019s government is at \u201cthe end of the road\u201d.\nHe said:\n\nShe\u2019s prime minister just in name. Keir Starmer is absolutely right to demand a general election. He\u2019s also right to highlight that we don\u2019t want just this government to lose, we want to deserve to win.\n\n\nUpdated at 3.28pm BST\n\n\n 12.58pm  \n\nDavid Davis claims that no Conservative really wants another leadership contest, which he said will \u201cmake the party look stupid\u201d.\nThe former Brexit secretary said many of his colleagues are \u201csitting in a shocked sense of terror on the prospects of being re-elected\u201d.\nHe told GB News:\n\nThe shock effect of that budget two weeks ago has rattled around the world really. It has rattled around the financial markets, both international currency markets and markets which have an impact on pensions. It rattled around politics and a lot of our colleagues are sitting in a shocked sense of terror on the prospects of getting re-elected.\nSo, yesterday, frankly, it scorched the flow, in a sense, but it\u2019s still a grim prospect for the Conservative party and the government. That being said, I think the removal of Kwasi Kwarteng was inevitable.\nHe was very responsible for the loss of credibility two weeks ago, that\u2019s what happened, it wasn\u2019t the numbers in the market, it was the credibility of the program in the markets, and so I suspect she had no choice but to replace him.\n\nJeremy Hunt, he said, has so far today \u201cshown to be very self-assured, and he\u2019s clearly creating space for action by talking about cancelling the various cuts and talking about bringing spending under control. He\u2019s certainly got off to a good start.\u201d\n\nThe thing that is on her [Truss\u2019s] side is that nobody really wants another leadership contest. It will make the party look stupid and it will be uncomfortable, and painful even. I don\u2019t see the prospect of a so-called unity candidate being probable.\n\n\nUpdated at 1.32pm BST\n\n\n 12.32pm  \n\nHow Brexit nearly scuppered the festival of Brexit. Ben Quinn reports: \nFor some, the whole project was supposed to be a celebration of Britain\u2019s departure from the EU.

Because it\u2019s in Yorkshire and Humber where we took our biggest steps. In Batley and Spen, where we beat back the forces of division with Kim Leadbeater. Fantastic. In local elections where we\u2019ve made important gains, taking control of Kirklees. Wins for Oliver Coppard and Tracy Brabin \u2013 two shining examples of what Labour can do in power. And as Rachel mentioned in June, with Simon Lightwood in Wakefield, our first byelection gain for a decade.\nWe have more to do of course. The road to a fairer, greener Britain runs right through this region. Fourteen battleground seats, 14 \u2013 and we must win them all. We need Luke Charters as the Labour MP for York Outer, Anna Dixon winning in Shipley, Marie Tidball here in Penistone and Stockbridge. We need them in as Labour MPs at the next election.\n\n\nWhen I became leader, I knew we had a huge task ahead. We had to change our party and prepare for power all in one go. Not change for change\u2019s sake. Change with a purpose, to make our Labour party fit to serve our country. That\u2019s why we had to rip antisemitism out by its roots, why we had to show our support for Nato is non-negotiable, show we want business to thrive and prosper, shed unworkable policies. Country first, party second.\nThere\u2019s always more work to do \u2013 I know that. I know how hard it\u2019s been for people on the receiving end from those who can\u2019t face up to the change we need. But always remember that together we have changed our party. The British people are looking at us again and we can return their gaze with confidence.\n\n\nBritain is crying out for clear leadership - Labour must provide it. We must turn our collar up and face the storm. Stand with working people. Meet their ambitions for real change. And build a new Britain, together. A Britain that is fairer, greener, more dynamic. Where we grow the economy and raise living standards for everyone, not just a privileged few, tackle climate change by creating new jobs, new industries, new opportunities, redesign our public services to unleash opportunity and provide security, restore faith in politics as a force for good, get Britain\u2019s hope, its confidence and its future back.\nBut it won\u2019t be easy. I would love to stand here and say Labour will fix everything. But the damage they\u2019ve done to our finances and public services means things are going to be really tough. We can\u2019t take irresponsible risks with the country\u2019s finances. We must be the party of sound money. You can\u2019t build a fairer, greener Britain without first restoring economic stability.\n\n\nEvery policy we announce will be fully costed. A new Office for Value for Money will make sure public spending targets the national interest. And we should be clear about what this means. It means not being able to do things \u2013 good Labour things \u2013 as quickly as we might like.\n\n\nAs a great Labour leader once said: \u201cYou can\u2019t play politics with people\u2019s jobs, with people\u2019s services or with their homes.\u201d As clear a warning against the dangers of \u201crigid dogma\u201d and \u201cimpossible promises\u201d as you will ever see\u2026\nYou might recognise it \u2013 I certainly do. But not just in that great footage of Neil. No. I see that attitude \u2013 the very same thing he was fighting against \u2013 in the behaviour of the Tories these past few weeks\u2026 And now we see the result. The \u201cgrotesque chaos\u201d of a Tory prime minister handing out redundancy notices to her own chancellor! And conference, there are no historical precedents for what they\u2019ve done to our economy.\n\n\nBritain has faced financial crises before. But the prime ministers and chancellors who wrestled with them all acted fast. When their policies ran against the rocks of reality, they took decisive action. But this lot, they didn\u2019t just tank the British economy. They also clung on. Clung on as they made the pound sink, clung on as they took our pensions to the brink of collapse, clung on as they pushed the mortgages and bills of the British people through the roof.\nThey did all of this. All of the pain our country faces now is down to them. And there\u2019s still one person clinging on. The prime minister. No doubt we will hear plenty of laughable excuses in the coming days. After twelve years of stagnation, that\u2019s all her party has left. But even they know she can\u2019t fix the mess she\u2019s created. And deep-down, her MPs know something else. They no longer have a mandate from the British people.\n\n\nTo end this national emergency once and for all, we also need a long-term plan, a plan that will deliver cheaper bills for working people - now and in the future growth and jobs in every part of our country and real independence from tyrants like Putin, who weaponise fossil fuels and threaten our security.\nThis is the central mission of the next Labour government. We will turn Britain into a green growth superpower. And driving us forward will be a goal that puts us ahead of any major economy in the world: 100% clean power by 2030. A goal that means investment in wind, solar, nuclear, hydrogen, green steel and carbon capture. Training for plumbers, electricians, engineers, software designers, technicians, builders. A national sovereign wealth fund that generates growth and private investment. Insulation for 19 million homes. And Great British Energy. A publicly owned company that takes advantage of the opportunities in clean British power and turns them into good, secure, high-paid British jobs.\n\n\nThe argument for our plan is simple. Clean energy is already cheaper than fossil fuels \u2013 nine times cheaper. Working people need more of it. Britain needs to own it. And the jobs and growth it creates must be shared with every community. British power to the British people.\n\n\nThis is why I\u2019ve always said we will fight the Tories on economic growth. It\u2019s not just their record - the worst decade for growth in two centuries. The \u201cvicious cycle of stagnation\u201d as the former chancellor calls it. It\u2019s that we have a clear and practical plan to spread the opportunities of the future to every community in Britain. That\u2019s why we struggle for growth \u2013 we lock too many communities out of the wealth we create, create too many jobs that are low paid and insecure. And our public services aren\u2019t strong enough to help working people succeed.\nThe Tory trickle-down fantasy has no answer to this. Working people won\u2019t be better off because we make the rich richer. It\u2019s fantasy economics - if you leave this many people behind a nation cannot grow fairly.\n\n\nDon\u2019t forget it, never again can we let the Tories claim to be a party of aspiration. Labour is the only party that can get home ownership rising again. And we will do it with a new set of political choices, a Labour set of political choices.\nWe will set a new target \u2013 70% home ownership. And we will meet it our way. No more buy-to-let landlords or second homeowners getting in first \u2026 Distorting the market in places like the Yorkshire Dales. We will back working people\u2019s aspiration, help real first-time buyers onto the ladder with a new mortgage guarantee scheme, reform planning so speculators can\u2019t stop us getting shovels in the ground. My message is this. If you\u2019re grafting every hour to buy your own home: Labour is on your side. Labour is the party of home ownership and aspiration in Britain today.\nBut conference, let\u2019s not kid ourselves. The next two years will be tough. The Tories will never give up on power \u2013 that\u2019s not who they are. And because of their record, because of the state of Britain, they\u2019re getting desperate. With so little that\u2019s good to defend, they\u2019ll lash out. So no complacency. No let up. Take nothing for granted. We need to be prepared, disciplined, relentlessly focused on the future, spend each day working to earn the trust of the British people, provide the leadership this country so desperately needs and walk towards a better future.\n\n\nUpdated at 11.19am BST\n\n\n 10.46am  \nSNP calls on Scottish Conservatives to 'grow a backbone' and tell Truss to resign\n\nThe Scottish National party has challenged Scottish Conservatives to \u201cgrow a backbone\u201d and tell Liz Truss to resign.\nMhairi Black, the SNP\u2019s spokesperson for Scotland, said the prime minister is on \u201cborrowed time\u201d and has driven the UK to the \u201cbrink of recession\u201d.\nShe called on Scottish Conservatives to \u201cearn some respect from colleagues and voters in Scotland\u201d by urging her to resign.\n\nLiz Truss\u2019 premiership is over - she is running on borrowed time.It is therefore on the Scottish Tories to end their silence, grow a backbone and call for her to go.The prime minister has driven the UK to the brink of a recession, and left the housing market on the verge of crashing \u2013 all within weeks of taking office. Sacking the clueless chancellor will not cut it. Despite knowing their colleagues at Westminster have zero respect for them, by calling for the prime minister to resign, at least the Scottish Tories would earn some respect from colleagues and voters in Scotland. This shambolic Tory-made economic crisis has once again shown why Scotland needs to break free from the shackles of this outdated, dysfunctional Westminster system. With independence, we can escape the chaos of Westminster control for good and rid ourselves of Tory government\u2019s once and for all.\n\n\n\nUpdated at 11.23am BST\n\n\n 10.36am  \nLabour leader accuses Truss of 'grotesque chaos', referencing Kinnock speech\n\nKeir Starner has accused Liz Truss of \u201cgrotesque chaos\u201d, referencing Neil Kinnock\u2019s famous 1985 conference speech.\nSpeaking in Barnsley, an area where he said Labour would have to win 14 battleground seats, he referenced the \u201cgrotesque chaos of a Tory prime minister handing out redundancy notices to her own chancellor\u201d.\nStarmer said that when he first became party leader, he knew Labour would have to \u201cchange and prepare for power in one go\u201d.\n\n\nUpdated at 11.24am BST\n\n\n 10.30am  \nThinktank says Hunt's efficiency savings are politically unviable\n\nThe Institute for Government thinktank has said that, historically, any efficiency savings are likely to come from public sector staff cuts and pay freezes.\nBut amid widespread labour shortages and strikes, the thinktank\u2019s programme director, Nick Davies, said he does not see how this is politically viable.\n\n\nUpdated at 11.27am BST\n\n\n 10.24am  \n\nTobias Ellwood, a senior Conservative and MP for Bournemouth East, has welcomed Jeremy Hunt\u2019s arrival, describing him as a \u201cwise inclusion\u201d in the government.\nHe said he was \u201cglad to be off the naughty step\u201d after having the whip restored following his party suspension for missing a confidence vote in the summer. \n\n\nUpdated at 12.34pm BST\n\n\n 10.12am  \n\nJohn Redwood, a Thatcherite Conservative MP, has warned Hunt that \u201cyou cannot tax your way to higher growth\u201d.\n\n\n\n\nUpdated at 10.19am BST\n\n\n 10.06am  \n\nMiriam Margolyes\u2019 sweary Today performance (see also 8.48am) reacting to Jeremy Hunt being hailed by some as the best moment of the Radio 4 programme\u2019s history:\n\n\nUpdated at 10.20am BST\n\n\n 10.02am  \n\nThe Guardian\u2019s economics editor, Larry Elliott, reports on how Kwasi Kwarteng\u2019s fate was sealed by the IMF orthodoxy he rallied against:\n\nIn a way, it was appropriate that Kwarteng\u2019s last full day in the job should have been in Washington, because the International Monetary Fund is the ultimate bastion of the economic orthodoxy the Truss government has been battling against for the past six weeks. Kwarteng\u2019s epitaph as chancellor might well be: I fought the orthodoxy and the orthodoxy won.\nThe IMF\u2019s unhappiness with the UK first surfaced two weeks before the annual meetings in Washington, when it put out a statement in the wake of September\u2019s tax-cutting mini-budget saying the measures were likely to \u201cincrease inequality\u201d, and it did not approve of large and unfunded stimulus packages when inflation was so high.\nThis week, the IMF turned the screw. Tuesday, the day before Kwarteng\u2019s arrival, saw the release of the Fund\u2019s two flagship publications: the world economic outlook and the global financial stability review. Both were critical of the UK, pointing out that the Treasury was adding to the cost of living at the same time as the Bank of England was raising interest rates to bring down inflation.

She is now fighting for her political survival.\nThat is after a chaotic 24 hours during which Truss and her chancellor insisted publicly they were sticking to the plan not to put up corporation tax \u2013 even as officials were privately briefing the exact opposite.\nKwasi Kwarteng\u2019s middle-of-the-night dash back from Washington confirmed the situation had reached crisis point. As the sun rose over Westminster, rumours he was about to be sacked were already spreading. One No 10 insider claimed Truss already knew she wanted him to \u201ccarry the can\u201d over the mini-budget disaster \u2013 while he was telling reporters he wasn\u2019t going anywhere.\nTruss will be hoping that sacking Kwarteng as chancellor will take the heat off her, at the very least buying her some valuable time to try to steady the mutinous Tory ship. But as his departure letter \u2013 and her reply \u2013 showed, their radical plan to rip up the economy to boost growth was very much a joint endeavour.\nKwarteng stressed to the prime minister that it was \u201cyour\u201d vision, while she responded that \u201cwe share the same vision\u201d.\nDespite the finger pointing, the pair have been on the same ideological journey for years, with the ill-fated budget fleshed out over coffee and biscotti in Kwarteng\u2019s Greenwich home way back in August.\n\nThe rest of the article is here:\n\n\nUpdated at 9.20am BST\n\n\n 9.06am  \n\nThe Labour leader, Keir Starmer, has joined tributes to David Amess, a year after the Conservative MP\u2019s murder.\nThe 69-year-old was stabbed to death while meeting constituents in Leigh-on-Sea in Essex on 15 October 2021.\nStarmer tweeted:\n\n\nUpdated at 9.14am BST\n\n\n 8.55am  \nKwarteng says Truss has only bought herself 'a few weeks' by sacking him\n\nOn today\u2019s front page of the Times, Kwasi Kwarteng says Liz Truss has only bought herself \u201ca few weeks\u201d by sacking him as chancellor and reversing the mini-budget.\n\n\nUpdated at 9.07am BST\n\n\n 8.48am  \nActor Miriam Margolyes says 'Fuck you, bastard' about Jeremy Hunt live on air\n\nActor Miriam Margolyes said she wanted to tell Jeremy Hunt \u2018Fuck you, bastard\u2019 after appearing on Radio 4 immediately after the new chancellor.\nSpeaking on the Today programme at the end of an interview about the death of Robbie Coltrane, she said:\n\nWhen I saw him [Hunt] there, I just said: \u2018What a hell of a job, the best of luck.\u2019\nAnd what I really wanted to say was: \u2018Fuck you, bastard,\u2019 but you can\u2019t say that.\n\n\n\nUpdated at 10.21am BST\n\n\n 8.38am  \nHunt insists Truss won leadership election 'fair and square' but admits: 'Some people, including me, didn't vote for the PM'\n\nHow long will Liz Truss be PM, Hunt is asked? \u201cI think what the country wants now is sustainability.\u201d\nHe adds: \u201cWhen we are judged at a general election we will be judged by what we deliver over the next 18 months.\u201d\nHe said he does not want to \u201cpretend it\u2019s not been a very difficult few weeks\u201d, but claims Conservatives are united in parliament around growth and Brexit success.\nHe admits: \n\nWe had a leadership election.

That is absolutely right and I also would like to be able to cut corporation tax.\n\nBut he declined to give any specific commitments about his fiscal statement on 31 October.\n\nI\u2019m not going to make any specific commitments about specific departments now, or indeed on the tax side about specific taxes, because we have to look at these things in the round. And we have to make sure as we take these very difficult decisions, we\u2019re honest with people about the situation we face.\n\n\nUpdated at 8.41am BST\n\n\n 7.56am  \n\nHow long Liz Truss can last as prime minister dominates today\u2019s UK front pages.\nThe Guardian calls it \u201ca day of chaos\u201d, as Kwasi Kwarteng lasts just 38 days in office and Truss is forced into a \u201chumiliating\u201d U-turn on a planned freeze on corporation tax. It notes Truss\u2019s press conference consisted of \u201ceight minutes, four questions and no apology\u201d.\n\nThe Mirror has clearly heard enough, declaring \u201cTime\u2019s up\u201d in its headline. It reports on growing calls for a general election, and Keir Starmer\u2019s desire for a change of government.\n\nThe Telegraph headlines: \u201cTruss clings to power after axing Kwarteng\u201d and reports on \u201can extraordinary day of reversals in Westminster that left Tory MPs despairing and sped up plotting among some rebels trying to remove Ms Truss\u201d. It says Truss warned during her leadership contest that the looming rise in corporation tax, which will now happen, would trigger a recession.\n\nYou can read the full paper round-up here:\n\n\nUpdated at 8.42am BST\n\n\n 7.38am  \nMistakes made in mini-budget, says new chancellor\n\nThe new chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, is on Sky News this morning discussing his plans for the position.\nHe says the Liz Truss administration has made \u201cmistakes\u201d and that there are \u201cdifficult decisions ahead\u201d.\nHe says:\n\nI want to do the right thing for British people.\nIt\u2019s a big honour to do the job that I\u2019ve been asked to do by the prime minister, but I want to be honest with people: we have some very difficult decisions ahead.\nThe last few weeks have been very tough but the context, of course, is coming out of a pandemic and a cost of living crisis.\nAnd the thing that people want, markets want, the country needs now, is stability. No chancellor can control the markets.\nBut what I can do is show that we can pay for our tax and spending plans and that is going to need some very difficult decisions on both spending and tax.\n\nHe adds:\n\nThere were mistakes. It was a mistake when we\u2019re going to be asking for difficult decisions across the board on tax and spending to cut the rate of tax paid by the very wealthiest.\nIt was a mistake to fly blind and to do these forecasts without giving people the confidence of the Office of Budget Responsibility saying that the sums add up.\nThe prime minister\u2019s recognised that, that\u2019s why I\u2019m here.\n\n\nUpdated at 8.44am BST\n\n\n 7.33am  \nLabour calls for general election\n\nKeir Starmer has called for a general election now regardless of whether Liz Truss is ousted by the Conservatives, saying the government is \u201ccompletely at the end of the road\u201d and Labour is preparing for power.\nIn an interview with the Guardian, the Labour leader said Truss had driven the economy \u201cinto a wall\u201d while \u201ctrashing our institutions\u201d, and changing the prime minister again without allowing the country to vote would not be acceptable.\nHowever, Starmer said he had told his shadow cabinet not to be complacent about the party\u2019s 30 points-plus poll lead, and that Labour was \u201cnot going to sit back\u201d but fight for every vote.\nHe said people were \u201clooking to Labour for the answers to the next election\u201d and the party needed to carry on putting in the work to win the contest, rather than assuming the government\u2019s incompetence would cause the Tories to lose.\n\u201cFor the good of the country we need a general election.\u201d\nRead the full interview here: \n\n\n\n\n 7.29am  \nLiz Truss clings to power after chaotic day\n\nGood morning. Liz Truss has been prime minister for 39 days but her political future remains far from certain after 24 hours in which she sacked Kwasi Kwarteng as chancellor, appointed Jeremy Hunt as his replacement and abandoned a flagship economic policy.\nThe announcement that corporation tax will rise next year (as planned by the previous government) rather than remain at 19% was intended to calm the financial markets after weeks of turmoil brought on by the mini-budget. Yet experts say the new chancellor may still need to find \u00a340bn in spending cuts to make the prime minister\u2019s current policies viable.\nAs my colleagues report, Truss said staying in her position as prime minister would help to \u201creassure the markets of our financial discipline\u201d, but the cost of government borrowing rose and the the pound fell after her press conference announcing the changes.\nSenior Conservative MPs are plotting how to remove her from office, with some mulling whether to publicly call for her to resign in the coming days. One former cabinet minister said they thought it was \u201c50/50 whether she will make it till Christmas\u201d, adding: \u201cIf I could wave a magic wand and get rid of her now then I would, but the problem is the mechanism.\u201d\nLabour, meanwhile, is calling for a general election whether Truss stays or goes. Speaking to the Guardian, the party\u2019s leader, Sir Keir Starmer, said:\n\nChange in personnel at the top of the Tory party is not the change we need. We need a change of government.\nWe are in the absurd situation where we are on the third, fourth prime minister in six years and within weeks we have a got a prime minister who has the worst reputational ratings of any prime minister pretty well in history.\nTheir party is completely exhausted and clapped out. It has got no ideas, it can\u2019t face the future and it has left the UK in a defensive crouch where we are not facing the challenges of the future because we haven\u2019t got a government that could lead us to the future.\nFor the good of the country we need a general election.\n\nStick with us for all the latest political developments throughout the day.\n\nUpdated at 8.47am BST\n"

                    "body": "As Boris Johnson told parliament that Europe must wean itself off Russian gas \u2013 to loosen Vladimir Putin\u2019s \u201cgrip on western politics\u201d \u2013 the Nikolay Zubov tanker was making its way back from British waters to the port of Sabetta, in northern Siberia. The 300m-long vessel had recently dropped off a consignment of liquefied natural gas (LNG) at the Isle of Grain terminal, in the Thames Estuary, operated by the National Grid. Steaming north under a Cypriot \u201cflag of convenience\u201d, it charted a course for Russia\u2019s Arctic coast, near the vast $27bn (\u00a320bn) Yamal gas facility, personally inaugurated by Putin in 2017.  Britain gets less than 5% of its gas from Russia, either flowing through subsea interconnector pipelines or arriving by boat at the Isle of Grain and two further LNG facilities at Milford Haven, South Wales. In the EU, whose gas market is so intermeshed with Britain\u2019s that it effectively determines the prices paid by UK end users, the picture is very different. Russia exports between 150bn and 190bn cubic metres of gas to Europe each year, typically fulfilling 30-40% of demand across the continent. It accounts for 65% of imports into Europe\u2019s economic powerhouse Germany and 100% for countries such as Latvia and Czech Republic. The obstacles to replacing Russian supplies are logistical, financial and political. So, if Europe \u2013 and by extension the UK \u2013 want to reduce their reliance on Putin\u2019s pumps, what are the options and how feasible are they, particularly in the short term? Liquefied natural gas  LNG is super-chilled gas, condensed into liquid form and transported by ship and \u201cregasified\u201d at specialist terminals. Ports including Milford Haven and Grain \u2013 Europe\u2019s biggest LNG terminal \u2013 take regular shipments. In 2020, Russian LNG accounted for 3% of total UK gas supply and, so far at least, there is no sign of shipments being affected by sanctions.  European ports including Montoir-de-Bretagne in France, Zeebrugge in Belgium and Rotterdam in the Netherlands have also welcomed Siberian visitors of late. Figures provided by Argus show that Russia has supplied 16% of Europe\u2019s LNG since February 2020. But Russia doesn\u2019t come close to being one of the biggest LNG exporters, a list headed by the US, Qatar and Australia. Qatar is reportedly willing to increase LNG exports to Europe and, even now, shipments of LNG from the US are moored off Milford Haven, at the South Hook and Dragon terminals. On paper, Europe has the capacity to import an extra 147bn cubic metres of LNG a year, according to analysts at Wood Mackenzie, enough to replace Russian pipeline gas entirely. But Wood Mackenzie\u2019s European gas analyst Graham Freedman said the switch would take \u201cat least a decade\u201d in practice, not least due to a lack of onward infrastructure in the right place. Germany, Europe\u2019s biggest gas market, has no LNG import terminals. Even a temporary switch would be hugely expensive. Tom Marzec-Manser, lead European gas analyst at energy consultancy ICIS, pointed out that LNG production is limited and consignments go to the highest bidder. European countries already wrestling with sky-high prices would have to outbid increasingly gas-hungry Asian economies. \u201cIt\u2019s an incredibly expensive short-term gap filler,\u201d he said. Alternative pipelines  Britain and Norway\u2019s North Sea fields, not to mention onshore resources in the Netherlands, contain sizeable reserves but scope for upping the flow is limited. Marzec-Manser said Norwegian state energy firm Equinor has raised production but there\u2019s \u201cnot much more they can do\u201d. UK North Sea output is already on the decline, with limited headroom for a short-term increase. The Netherland\u2019s\u2019 vast Groningen field is an option in theory but probably not in practice, say analysts at Jefferies. It could provide 13bn cubic metres, equivalent to 9% of Russian supply. But the Dutch government is winding down production after drilling was found to be causing earthquakes. Reversing that decision looks politically unpalatable. Nuclear power or coal  Nuclear power reduces reliance on gas for electricity and the UK generates up to 20% of its power that way. While much of the fleet is due to be retired by 2025, the government has thrown its weight behind rebuilding that capacity. But doing so takes time and does little to replace gas in cooking or heating homes. France gets 70% of its power from nuclear energy, affording it much more protection from volatile gas prices. But Germany announced its withdrawal from nuclear power after the 2011 Fukushima disaster, and in 2019 said it would pull the plug on coal-fired plants. Those decisions have left it more dependent than most major economies on Russian gas. In practice, Germany is unlikely to change its mind on decommissioning nuclear power stations. Given the climate crisis, few European countries are minded to turn back to coal. Fracking  The UK government ordered a moratorium on all new fracking wells in 2019 but the gas price crisis has brought advocates out of the woodwork. They include Lord Frost \u2013 who presided over the UK\u2019s Brexit negotiations \u2013 and Viscount Ridley, who chaired Northern Rock when it collapsed. The idea is that the UK could mimic the shale gas revolution that has transformed the US into a net energy exporter. Experts say otherwise \u2013 that fracking the way out of the Ukraine crisis doesn\u2019t make geological, logistical, economic or political sense. Michael Bradshaw, professor of global energy at Warwick Business School, points out that the UK\u2019s reserves are harder to tap geologically than those in the US. Unlike the US, potential sites are surrounded by densely populated areas that are governed by strict planning laws and populated by people who don\u2019t actually support fracking, making it politically impossible. Concerns about water and noise pollution persist and even if those were overcome, fracking would have vanishingly little impact on European wholesale prices, while also taking years to develop. \u201cBy the time we did it, we probably wouldn\u2019t need the gas,\u201d said Bradshaw. Renewables and home insulation  Ultimately, renewable energy and decreased demand, by improving home energy efficiency through better insulation, offers the most obvious long-term solution. However, this depends on major investment and improvement in technologies such as battery storage, which makes up for the intermittency in supply from technologies such as wind power. Marzec-Manser said that the Ukraine crisis might well motivate Europe to go hell for leather for a renewable future but that it is already moving faster than any other part of the world. \u201cIt\u2019s like trying to move into sixth gear when your car only has five gears,\u201d he said."

                    "body": "When Alcohol Free finished in mid-division in the Platinum Jubilee Stakes at Royal Ascot, it seemed possible the attempt to turn Andrew Balding\u2019s Group One-winning miler into a Group One-winning sprinter might be quietly shelved.\nBut Jeff Smith, Alcohol Free\u2019s owner and breeder, had other ideas and his filly proved to be a very fast learner. The four-year-old was sent off as a 14-1 shot for the July Cup here on Saturday, against a field that included several of the horses that beat her at Ascot and she reversed the form with something to spare.\n\nNaval Crown, a narrow winner of the Platinum Jubilee, set off to make the running and Alcohol Free, settled just behind him by Rob Hornby, looked much more comfortable at sprinting pace than she had three weeks earlier. Naval Crown had no answer when Hornby sent her to the front just over a furlong out, eventually finishing a length and a half behind Alcohol Free with Artorius, third at Ascot, staying on from off the pace to take the same spot here.\nNeither Smith nor Andrew Balding were at Newmarket to enjoy her success, but Anna Lisa Balding, the trainer\u2019s wife, said that much of the kudos belonged to the owner.\n\u201cJeff has always said six furlongs is the right trip, so he deserves a lot of credit,\u201d she said. \u201cShe\u2019s such a lovely filly, quirky but we all love her. She very rarely disappoints and she\u2019s got a huge heart.\u201d\nIt was quite a moment too for Hornby, who was still looking for the first Group One winner of his career on Friday morning and perhaps still bruised as well after losing the ride on Westover, third home in the Derby, before the colt\u2019s success in the Irish Derby a fortnight ago.\nLess than 48 hours later, Hornby is a dual winner at the highest level, having added to his surprise victory on Prosperous Voyage in Friday\u2019s Falmouth Stakes with another major win at double-figure odds.\n\u201cTwo Group Ones in two days, who\u2019d have thought it?\u201d, Hornby said. \u201cIt\u2019s been a crazy year but I\u2019m in a very privileged position to ride top-class horses.\n\n\u201cThe thinking is that in this race, her stamina would kick in up the hill, she\u2019d see it out really well and that\u2019s what happened. The ground started to get quick but it just goes to show her guts and bravery and how tough she is.\u201d\nAlcohol Free is now expected to step back up to a mile in the Sussex Stakes at Glorious Goodwood later this month, a race she won 12 months ago, when the top-class colts Baaeed, unbeaten in eight starts, and Coroebus, the 2,000 Guineas winner, are likely opponents.\nBrian Meehan\u2019s Manton stable has been short of a genuine Group One horse for several seasons but the trainer believes he may have found a potential Classic contender in Isaac Shelby, who edged out Victory Dance, the favourite, by a head in the Group Two Superlative Stakes.\nThis was Meehan\u2019s first Group Two success since Barraquero took the Richmond at Glorious Goodwood nearly five years ago and he sees Isaac Shelby as a \u201cfour-race two-year-old\u201d who will have at least one start at Group One level this season.\n\u201cHe\u2019s the business, I think, he\u2019s really special,\u201d Meehan said. \u201cHe could even be a Guineas horse.\n\u201cThis is high-end stuff here and he\u2019s really proved himself. You take it step-by-step but he\u2019s a horse that\u2019s going to continue to improve, physically there\u2019s still massive improvement there.\n\u201cGoodwood would be too soon but Doncaster [for the Champagne Stakes in early September] is definitely a race I\u2019ve thought of, and I love the Breeders\u2019 Cup, so the Juvenile Turf [at Keeneland in November] is going to factor into it as well.\u201d\n\nOn a busy day of racing around the country, Anmaat paid a compliment to his trainer, Owen Burrows, by winning the John Smith\u2019s Cup at York, one of the season\u2019s most valuable and competitive handicaps, off a 287-day break.\nThe 5-1 joint-favourite held on by half a length and a neck from Achelois and Intellogent, who was closest at the finish after struggling for running room at the two-furlong pole."

Overall, despite the odd stumble here, the odd unauthorised interview from Romelu Lukaku there, life was good. Chelsea were an undisputed member of the elite and, after escaping the infighting and egos at Paris Saint-Germain, Tuchel appreciated being left to do what he loves most: coach his team and concentrate on the football. But then, as Chelsea prepared to face Liverpool in the Carabao Cup final at the end of February, the mood shifted. The Russian invasion of Ukraine was under way which put Roman Abramovich in an awkward position. Suddenly, Tuchel was fielding questions about Abramovich\u2019s future at Chelsea. Incredibly, he was prepared to answer them. \u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d Tuchel said, responding to a question about Abramovich being accused in parliament of having links to the Russian state. \u201cWe should not pretend this is not an issue.\u201d It was something of an understatement from Chelsea\u2019s manager. The news cycle soon became relentless. It felt irrelevant when Tuchel brought on Kepa Arrizabalaga for penalties against Liverpool and the Spanish goalkeeper sent the decisive spot-kick into orbit. Football was an afterthought.  Nobody was asking Tuchel about his team. How could they when confirmation that Abramovich was selling the club came 69 minutes before Chelsea were due to face Luton in the fifth round of the FA Cup on 2 March? Or when the UK government imposed sanctions on the Russian oligarch on the morning of Chelsea\u2019s trip to Norwich on 10 March? \u201cI am not a politician,\u201d Tuchel had said, his patience understandably stretched by the repeated questions about war, but now he was the public face of a frozen asset. The Chelsea hierarchy mostly stayed quiet. There was a television interview with Petr Cech, the club\u2019s technical and performance adviser, but nothing from key figures such as Marina Granovskaia and Bruce Buck, both of whom are close to Abramovich. Instead the responsibility fell on Tuchel to speak about an unprecedented situation during press conferences. Any knocks, Thomas? Any thoughts on Timo Werner\u2019s search for goals? And while we\u2019ve got you, any idea how long until Mr Abramovich finds a buyer? It has been dizzying. Chelsea are back at Wembley on Saturday afternoon, hoping for revenge against Liverpool in the FA Cup final, but their heads are spinning. The uncertainty has weighed heavily on them and, as Tuchel puts it, they are desperate for an injection of \u201cpositive energy\u201d that confirmation of Todd Boehly\u2019s consortium buying the club will bring.  The sense of drift has been difficult to hold off. Operating under a special licence has taken a toll. The sight of empty seats at Stamford Bridge in recent weeks has been jarring, with Chelsea unable to sell tickets for home games, and performances have merely served to deepen the gloom. Perhaps a lack of motivation was to be expected. Chelsea are unable to sell or buy players and they cannot hand out new contracts. It is not a surprise that the dressing room is unsettled. The club has inevitably felt directionless and Tuchel was not exactly spilling state secrets when he admitted that Antonio R\u00fcdiger\u2019s and Andreas Christensen\u2019s impending departures on free transfers have had a negative impact. Losing R\u00fcdiger to Real Madrid is a huge blow. The commanding centre-back\u2019s teammates are not happy about Chelsea\u2019s failure to keep him, and Christensen will leave a further hole in central defence when he joins Barcelona, who are also targeting C\u00e9sar Azpilicueta and Marcos Alonso. The situation is far from ideal. Tuchel has mostly exuded dignity, charm and intelligence but even he has struggled at times. He has despaired at Chelsea\u2019s defensive solidity disappearing and the individual errors piling up. He has grasped for solutions to his side\u2019s indifferent home form.  There was the long night of chocolate as Tuchel pored over clips of Chelsea\u2019s defeat in the first leg of their Champions League quarter-final to Madrid. A week later he came up with a superb gameplan at the Bernab\u00e9u, only to be undone by Karim Benzema and Luka Modric. It has been one thing after another. But for all the whispers about Tuchel leaving, it is not for show when he says that he loves his job. He wants Cech and Granovskaia to stay but is excited about working under new owners. What Tuchel needs now is backing as he tries to turn Chelsea into title contenders. The challenge for Boehly and his partners will be to trust their manager. Tuchel will be their biggest asset. He performed wonders by winning the Champions League last year, has won the European Super Cup and Club World Cup this season, and has exuded authority over the past three months, a voice of calm and reason throughout the most unsettling period in Chelsea\u2019s history. Tuchel has been the guiding light. His value to Chelsea, who are close to clinching Champions League qualification, has never been clearer. Normality is returning, Lukaku is scoring and the most immediate task is to find a way past Liverpool. Tuchel, who will soon be back to focusing solely on football, will surely have a plan as Chelsea look to close out the Abramovich era with one last trophy. He will know that this strangest of seasons could yet end on a high."

                    "body": "Western officials fear a UN pledging conference this Thursday aimed at raising more than $4.4bn (\u00a33.34bn) aid for Afghanistan is likely to fall well short of its target. One UN official admitted he feared the Taliban\u2019s increasingly repressive rule would lead to a donor backlash. The new UN appeal, on top of the flash appeal for $600m in the immediate wake of the Taliban takeover in August, is hoping to raise the biggest sum ever for a single country at a pledging conference. But the decision by the Taliban on 23 March to renege on a pledge to let girls above grade 6 return to education, leading to street protests, is likely to put many donors off. The World Bank has put four projects in Afghanistan worth $600m from its reworked Afghan Reconstruction Trust Fund on hold until the position is clarified. Plans to pay teachers\u2019 salaries through the fund are being reviewed, at least in the schools where older children are banned. The UN estimates that about 10 million children across Afghanistan urgently need humanitarian assistance to survive. The UK announced on Wednesday it was providing \u00a3286m this financial year, the same as last year, promising none of the money would go to reward the Taliban.  The sum was criticised by the former international development secretary Andrew Mitchell, who said the UK traditionally would have offered \u00a3325m, or 10% of the target. The UK is co-hosting the pledging event along with Germany, Qatar and the UN. Preparations for the event have been relatively brief, and a Yemen pledging event fell short. Western aid formed 75% of the Afghan government budget before the Taliban took over. It had been hoped the UN\u2019s pledging conference would take place against an optimistic backdrop of older children having just started the new school year for the first time since the Taliban seized power, making international recognition of the Taliban a realistic objective. Repeated assurances that older girls would be able to attend had been given to western officials, and Unicef agencies, right up to the start of the new school year, by those Taliban leaders that favour normalisation. But western officials now say they think their interlocutors were trying to ease through the reform in a low-key way, establishing facts on the ground, without the supreme leader, Haibatullah Akhundzada, being fully consulted. Since then a raft of other repressive measures have been imposed over the transmission of western media, such as the BBC, as well as new requirements for men to wear beards if working in offices. Women have also been banned from travelling by air independently. Taliban determination to be able to direct or to tax humanitarian aid is also said to be rising. Achim Steiner, the head of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), in Kabul this week warned further delays in starting classes not only harmed the girls\u2019 futures, but risked Afghanistan being ignored. \u201cFor us and the United Nations, this is a critical moment in which the world needs to understand Afghanistan,\u201d he told reporters on Monday. \u201cBut the leadership of Afghanistan must also recognise that the world can very easily turn to other crises.\u201d If there were any \u201ctechnical constraints\u201d in reopening the schools the UN would make it a top priority to resolve them, Steiner said. \u201cBut if it were to signal a more fundamental reversal on this principle, it would indeed create I think a crisis in the way that both the international community and the country could relate to one another,\u201d he said. With the west\u2019s influence hitting a roadblock, China looks to be jumping in. Yue Xiaoyong, China\u2019s special envoy for Afghan affairs, will host a two-day meeting starting on Wednesday in Tunxi, in eastern China\u2019s Anhui province, of foreign ministers of Afghanistan\u2019s six neighbouring countries. The acting foreign minister of the Afghan interim government, Amir Khan Muttaqi, is due to attend, as well as the Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov. The Chinese foreign minister, Wang Yi, made a surprise visit to Kabul last week and stressed China \u201crespects the religious beliefs and national customs of Afghanistan\u201d, and \u201cnever interfered in Afghanistan\u2019s internal affairs\u201d. The UN security council, through a resolution last year backed up by as many as seven US Treasury statements, has had some success in reassuring donors and aid agencies that it is possible to operate in the country without risk of US sanctions, but banks and finance houses remain nervous. Diplomatic recognition of the Taliban, much more possible if the education for secondary-age girls had been allowed, now remains off the table, leaving the cloud of uncertainty about whether aid activity becomes sanctionable. The UN is still required to fund some of its activities by sending large suitcases of cash into Kabul. A World Bank fund for Afghanistan has released \u00a31.2bn for development work, and the Asian Development Bank has a $405m fund."

                    "body": "Toulon had been hoping to replicate the old glory days of Jonny Wilkinson and co but it was Lyon who emerged with the Challenge Cup spoils on a warm night in the south of France. This is the first European title ever claimed by the up-and-coming Top 14 side and, with their confidence now boosted, it is unlikely to be the last.  They might have won by an even wider margin, having been denied at least three more potential first-half tries, but were still good enough to turn a slender 10-7 half-time advantage into a 20-point cushion by the start of the final quarter. Lyon\u2019s coach Pierre Mignoni, ironically, is returning to Toulon this summer and will hope this outcome has a suitably galvanising effect on the losers. As an occasion it proved to be a slightly mixed aperitif for the main event involving Leinster and La Rochelle. Toulon may have seen off Saracens in some style in the semi-final but, with their international winger Gabin Villi\u00e8re forced off prematurely with a knee injury, they could not summon anything like the same zest and inspiration. It was, even so, another indicator of the growing appetite for big rugby occasions in France. The crowd of over 51,000 was a record attendance for a Challenge Cup final and, amid the spills and occasional thrills, there were a few more reminders for the watching Eddie Jones that Les Bleus will take some beating at next year\u2019s Rugby World Cup. Jones and his assistant coaches were also on a scouting mission to check out the ground where England will potentially play a quarter-final. If this steep-sided, curving arena is even half as noisy and atmospheric in the absence of Toulon\u2019s fanatical supporters, it will be special regardless of the weather. The temperature was still up around 26 degrees celsius at 9pm local time when the game kicked off but it was Lyon who initially kept the cooler heads. Only a belatedly spotted knock-on in the buildup prevented Baptiste Couilloud from scoring with barely a minute gone and the scrum-half had a legal try on the board after eight minutes.  The great Sergio Parisse dearly wanted another trophy to crown a remarkable career but, unfortunately for him, his pass found his opposite number Jordan Taufua, once of Leicester. The Lyon captain surged away and also had the presence of mind, when tackled, to pop the ball up off the floor to the supporting Couilloud. A sluggish Toulon, though, were waking up and their own international scrum-half, Baptiste Serin, started and finished a compelling move which dragged his side back into the contest. Nerves then appeared to constrain both teams for a while before the first 40 minutes ended in dramatic circumstances when the young Georgian wing Davit Niniashvili appeared to have put Lyon, already 10-7 ahead, further in front with a try just before the interval. On closer inspection, though, it was discovered that the tip of his left boot had grazed the dead-ball line, a sharp-eyed decision which may preclude the English TMO, Ian Tempest, from holidaying in the Burgundy region this summer. There had already been some Lyon muttering at the decision not to review a possible try by Charlie Ngatai, with Aymeric Luc\u2019s supposed in-goal grounding of the ball not entirely supported by the video evidence.  Lyon\u2019s luck, though, was about to change. Between the 45th and 50th minutes they collected 14 priceless points, the first of them a fully deserved penalty try when Luc was sin-binned for the most blatant of last-gasp slapdowns which denied Niniashvili, assuming he would have put it down legally this time, a certain score. Against 14 men the powerful Josua Tuisova made good ground and L\u00e9o Berdeu\u2019s well-judged chip fell nicely for his centre Pierre-Louis Barassi. Another Berdeu penalty stretched the lead further, effectively snuffing out Toulon\u2019s hopes of joining Wasps, Bath, Northampton and Leinster and becoming the first French side to do the Heineken Cup and Challenge Cup \u2018double\u2019. Despite final quarter yellow cards for Berdeu and Ngatai and a late consolation try for the otherwise quiet Cheslin Kolbe, there was to be no reprieve for Toulon, beaten in the Challenge Cup finals of 2010, 2012 and 2020 and now required to deal with another frustrating showpiece loss."

                    "body": "Beneath the beautiful curving roof of this spectacular stadium the question was whether Leinster could graduate as the modern masters of the European game. For some time they have been on a mission to secure a record-equalling fifth Champions Cup title and for almost 79 minutes the stage seemed set to complete their grand design. And then, right at the last, it all fell apart. After what felt like several years of concerted La Rochelle forward pressure the ball arrived in the hands of their reserve scrum-half Arthur Reti\u00e8re, one of the smaller men on the field. He stumbled at first but recovered his poise and stretched just far enough to touch the line and deliver the ultimate European prize to the Atlantic Coast for the first time. In truth it had been coming. Time after time La Rochelle had driven at the thin blue Leinster defensive line, roared on by the thousands of black and yellow-clad fans behind the posts. In the final analysis, despite six penalties from Ireland\u2019s architect-in-chief Johnny Sexton, the try count said it all. Three-nil to the side coached by Ronan O\u2019Gara, the day\u2019s unquestioned Irish winner. It was a nightmare outcome for Sexton, a rare misjudgement on his own line having presented La Rochelle with the position from which a close-range try by their hooker Pierre Bourgarit had dragged them back into a last quarter dogfight. It was to prove a crucial moment, despite the 64th minute sin-binning of the La Rochelle lock Thomas Lavault for a silly trip on Jamison Gibson-Park. And what a triumph this was for O\u2019Gara, now only the second person after Leinster\u2019s Leo Cullen to win the title as both a player and head coach. There was a respectful post-match handshake with Sexton but this result will further polish an increasingly fine coaching CV. \u201cWithout any semblance of arrogance we genuinely believed we\u2019d win today,\u201d said O\u2019Gara afterwards. \u201cThere were one of two guys sulking at 12-7 down at half-time but we knew we\u2019re a second-half team. We knew that the last 20 minutes was where we could get them.\u201d Starved of possession and with a lop-sided tackle against them, Leinster were also left to absorb the brutal truth that, after the opening 10 minutes, they rarely threatened to score a try. \u201cMaybe we should have been more aggressive at times and gone for tries,\u201d admitted a downcast Sexton afterwards. \u201cBut everyone\u2019s an expert in hindsight. A lot of things didn\u2019t go our way in the last 30 minutes when we had control of the game. It\u2019s tough to take.\u201d If only Leinster could have continued as they started. They drove their first lineout, clearly keen to make a physical point, and were rewarded with two early Sexton penalties. The pinball wizardry of their distribution when things are clicking with ball in hand was tantalisingly in evidence. But this was a La Rochelle team prepared to be patient and soon enough they hit back hard. Their South African winger Raymond Rhule is a fast, strong unit and the usually reliable Hugo Keenan was beaten for sheer dynamic pace. Ihaia West has had his shaky goal-kicking moments but his wide-angled conversion was a peach. Leinster responded by making a change at hooker after just 15 minutes, with their Irish international Ronan Kelleher holding his arm as he came off. Dan Sheehan is a highly promising player but La Rochelle\u2019s tight scrummagers did not look entirely broken-hearted. A much cagier game subsequently developed. Scrappy is not Leinster\u2019s preferred setting and La Rochelle, growing in confidence, began to send a fleet of HGV trucks thundering up the middle. The ex-Springbok Rhule, no longer the fleeting exception, was suddenly everywhere.  From a neutral perspective this was excellent news: the organisers needed a proper contest rather than an Irish procession, with next year\u2019s final already slated for Dublin. And now they had one, with roars of \u2018Allez, Allez!\u2019 from the stands and Leinster under sustained siege close to their own line. At times they barely held firm. There was a particularly key moment when, with La Rochelle on the attack, the referee Wayne Barnes was advised to penalise Dany Priso on the loose-head side for collapsing. Priso was aghast but Barnes was adamant. Up the other end went Leinster and secured another penalty for offside bang in front of the sticks. They looked happy enough as they trotted in at the interval with a five-point cushion.  Niggling away in the back of Irish minds, though, was last year\u2019s semi-final when, having led narrowly at half-time, Leinster ended up being physically demolished and lost 32-23. When a West penalty narrowed the margin to just two points inside as many second half minutes, the air of tension ratcheted up a further notch. Even after Sexton\u2019s sixth penalty La Rochelle continued to pour forwards, only the final pass refusing to stick. But then came Sexton\u2019s failure to clear his lines following a missed drop-goal attempt, Bourgarit\u2019s rumbling maul score and West\u2019s second nerveless conversion, setting up a soaring finale worthy of the setting. Has it been a vintage European Champion\u2019s Cup season overall? Maybe not, with the curse of Covid stunting its early stages. But the final was well staged and, generally-speaking, the heartbeat of the tournament remains strong. Although, watching these two formidable teams smashing away at each other, it might be a while before an English side next hoists the trophy."

                    "body": "A Saudi woman recently sentenced to 45 years in prison was convicted of using the internet and social media accounts to \u201cspread lies through tweets\u201d, among other alleged crimes, according to a newly obtained Saudi court document. Noura al-Qahtani, whose case first emerged last week, is a mother of five daughters, including one with a disability, is nearly 50 years old and has health issues, according to the court records. The document, which describes Qahtani\u2019s conviction and sentencing by a special criminal court, was shared with the Guardian by Abdullah Alaoudh, the Gulf director at Dawn, a pro-democracy group based in Washington founded by the murdered Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi. The court records reveal \u2013 for a second time in weeks \u2013 a draconian sentence against a seemingly ordinary woman who used social media to voice support for dissidents but was not personally engaged in political activity. It contradicts the public image the Saudi government and its supporters have sought to foster of women enjoying more personal freedom under the rule of the de facto Saudi leader, Mohammed bin Salman. Last month, a Saudi appeals court sentenced Salma al-Shehab, a Leeds University PhD student and mother of two, to 34 years in prison for having a Twitter account and for following and retweeting dissidents and activists. Shehab was arrested and convicted after she had returned home to Saudi Arabia for a holiday. The sentence was widely condemned and the US state department said it had several discussions with Saudi counterparts to discuss the case. In Qahtani\u2019s case, the court document states that she used two anonymised Twitter accounts. One of the accounts, @Najma097, appears to have last been active on 4 July 2021 and follows 293 Twitter accounts. Some tweets appear to be critical of Prince Mohammed and support the rights of political detainees. Qahtani was convicted of several charges, including that she sought to \u201cbesmirch\u201d the crown prince and King Salman; that she \u201cencouraged participation in activities that damage the security and stability of society and the state\u201d; that she expressed \u201csupport\u201d for the ideology of those who wish to \u201cdestabilise\u201d the kingdom; for joining a group dedicated to these causes on Twitter and following them on YouTube. She was also convicted of \u201cinsulting\u201d state symbols and officials, seeking the release of detainees, and obstructing the investigation into her social media use by \u201cdestroying and hiding the mobile phone use in the crime\u201d. She was also convicted of being in possession of a banned book, which was written by Salman Alaoudh, a well-known reformist cleric \u2013 and father of Abdullah Alaoudh of Dawn \u2013 who is himself serving a life sentence in a Saudi prison. Salman Alaoudh has been in prison since 2017 after he called for peace on Twitter following the implementation of a Saudi-led blockade on Qatar. The book Qahtani is alleged to have possessed was not one of Alaoudh\u2019s political books. It was described by Abdullah \u2013 who is based in the US \u2013 as a book about self improvement and fighting selfishness within one\u2019s self. \u201cIt is a very apolitical book,\u201d Abdullah Alaoudh said. The court document also references a technical analysis by state officials but it does not contain any information about how Saudi authorities identified the Twitter handle as \u2013 allegedly \u2013 being used by Qahtani. Twitter did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The US social media company was infiltrated by Saudi state officials in 2014 and 2015. US prosecutors have described how the infiltration by the officials, who were employed by Twitter but were secretly being paid by senior Saudi government officials, led Saudi authorities to gain access to information about anonymous dissidents who were using Twitter inside the kingdom. The company has allowed Bader al-Asaker, a senior aide to Prince Mohammed, who was described by US prosecutors as the mastermind behind the Saudi infiltration, to maintain his verified Twitter account. The court document states that Qahtani was first sentenced to 13 years\u2019 imprisonment in connection with her \u201ccrimes\u201d. The sentence was lengthened to 45 years after a prosecutor complained during her appeal that the original sentence was too lenient. The court document shows Qahtani presented a defence in court, including that she was not a terrorist or planning a terrorist attack or part of a terrorist organisation. She also stated that she was nearly 50, had no prior record, and regretted her tweets. The appeals court, the document shows, not only increased her sentence to 45 years, but imposed a 45-year travel ban once she emerges from prison, at about the age of 100. Her disabled daughter is 10 and suffers from a genetic disorder that causes developmental disabilities. The Saudi embassy in Washington was not immediately available for a comment. According to the date on the court document, the new sentence was handed down on 9 August 2022."

                    "body": "If there is one lesson to emerge from this European club rugby season it is the importance of ambition. As recently as eight years ago both this weekend\u2019s champion teams, La Rochelle and Lyon, were together in the second tier of French rugby with their noses pressed to the Top 14 glass. Without the incentive of promotion, they would still be on the outside looking in. Along with Exeter Chiefs they offer hope to wannabes everywhere, living proof that rugby growth is about more than jealously guarding the status quo. The overall commercial gateau may be larger in France, where municipal ownership of stadiums is a significant factor, but the trend is increasingly pronounced. French rugby at all levels continues to boom while the domestic game in England and Wales battles to remain solvent.  La Rochelle have also underlined another fundamental truth: that adversity can make teams and people stronger. This time last year Ronan O\u2019Gara\u2019s squad were downcast losers against Toulouse in Europe\u2019s showpiece fixture and were beaten in the Top 14 final as well. Now they are top dogs, having chewed up Leinster\u2019s dream of modern European dominance. O\u2019Gara and his players unquestionably deserve much credit: this was one of the more dramatic chases in these parts since Jimmy \u201cPopeye\u201d Doyle in French Connection II. As he explained to BT Sport\u2019s Craig Doyle (no relation) afterwards, O\u2019Gara had pored over the footage of Leinster\u2019s knockout games in Galway and Leicester and put together an 80-minute strategy he truly believed would deliver. \u201cThose games gave me enough ammunition to work with,\u201d revealed O\u2019Gara, having stressed to his squad the importance of not standing off Leinster defensively and going harder still in the final 20 minutes. \u201cThey\u2019re very strong in the Aviva but thankfully this game was in Marseille. We had ample opportunities to jump ship, particularly at 18-10 down having just had a yellow card, but teams with bottle, belief and a vision find a way to win. I\u2019m very proud of their mental resolve. This is the start of something special, I hope.\u201d Having seen his men score three tries to nil and repeat their trick of overturning a half-time deficit, as they also managed against Leinster in last year\u2019s semi-final, it can already be said with confidence that O\u2019Gara is a coach rapidly going places. This outcome further confirmed what longtime colleagues such as his assistant coach Donnacha Ryan have long known. \u201cThis all starts with Rog. His work ethic is incredible and I have no doubt he has the potential to do whatever [job] he wants to do.\u201d Which is exactly what a range of other clubs and Test nations far beyond the Atlantic coast will now be thinking.  Having grown up in a tough school in Munster as a player, O\u2019Gara has displayed the courage and self-awareness to head overseas and educate himself in high-performing environments in both hemispheres. \u201cHe has been a success at Racing, Crusaders and now La Rochelle,\u201d continues Ryan. \u201cIt is not an accident that has happened. For him if he has his mind set on something then he will achieve it.\u201d Not the least of his skills has been instilling a similar unswerving belief in others, particularly at a club that had never played Champions Cup rugby before 2017. Convincing them they really could compete on two fronts took O\u2019Gara a while. \u201cYou\u2019ve got all sorts of nationalities, you\u2019re speaking in pidgin French and they\u2019re looking at you going, \u2018Why should we believe you, coach?\u2019 I\u2019m like, \u2018Stay with me here, we can do this.\u2019 Once we got a bit of momentum you could see them thinking, \u2018I can see what this crazy Irishman is talking about. Maybe we can have a go at both.\u2019\u201d It clearly helps to have players of the relentless calibre and power of Gr\u00e9gory Alldritt and the giant Australian Will Skelton, who has now won Champions Cup finals against Leinster with two different clubs. The Leinster flanker Josh van der Flier has been crowned Europe\u2019s player of the year but, when it came to the crunch, the La Rochelle pack ground down their counterparts to the point where the decisive try, scored by a sniping Arthur Reti\u00e8re with just over a minute left to play, was no less than O\u2019Gara\u2019s side deserved. The ripple effect could be considerable, and not just for Leinster, whose cloak of invincibility has been abruptly removed. Johnny Sexton has had many great days in his career and contributed 18 points here but, at almost 37, this was a chastening disappointment that would age anyone.  Can he really bounce back and deliver World Cup glory for Ireland? And might O\u2019Gara\u2019s tactical triumph also be the way to wrong-foot some of the world\u2019s other leading sides? The watching England head coach Eddie Jones will not have been alone in pondering whether this muscular blueprint might yet bear fruit in next year\u2019s Six Nations and at the subsequent World Cup. On the flipside it is not impossible that England will run into the formidable Skelton on their summer tour to Australia while the task of stopping motivated French sides in France grows ever tougher. And, with Jones stepping aside late next year, can the Rugby Football Union simply sit back and watch a five-star general like O\u2019Gara be snapped up by another major rival? Having propelled \u201cLa Rog-chelle\u201d to the summit, it will be fascinating to see what the exiled Munster mastermind does next."

                    "body": "Christian Williams has enjoyed a memorable season in valuable staying handicap chases and holds a very strong hand as the campaign draws to a close in the Bet365 Gold Cup at Sandown on Saturday.\nKitty\u2019s Light, desperately unlucky when placed third in this race 12 months ago, is joined in the line-up by stable companion Win My Wings, the easy winner of the Scottish Grand National earlier this month when Kitty\u2019s Light finished seven lengths away in second.\nCap Du Nord, a comfortable winner for the stable at Kempton in February, is also in the field, but the Ayr 1-2 look like Williams\u2019s prime contenders.\n\nKitty\u2019s Light is, in theory, weighted to reverse the form on 12lb better terms, but fast-improving Win My Wings (3.32) had plenty left in the tank last time and, with Rob James claiming a very useful 7lb, she is worth a bet at around 5-1 to become the first horse since 2007 to complete the Ayr-Sandown double.\nSandown: 1.50 There was plenty of market confidence behind Whizz Kid before his handicap debut at the Grand National meeting, when his inexperience showed in some hit-and-miss hurdling. He did well to finish less than three lengths behind the winner in the circumstances and with Sam Twiston-Davies replacing a conditional in the saddle, a more polished round of jumping would make him the one to beat.\n\nHaydock: 2.05 Alrehb has yet to race on turf but he has a big chance at the weights on his all-weather form and the excellent Laura Pearson takes off a handy 3lb.\nSandown: 2.25 Erne River was second-favourite for a Grade One novice at Aintree last time and was slightly hampered when falling at the 10th fence. He had done nothing wrong in two previous chase starts, recording a decent winning time in both, and though he has a few pounds to find with his three rivals on ratings, he has much more scope for improvement. The early betting, which rates him the 5-1 outsider of the field, looks wrong.\nLeicester 2.45: Happy Power is the second-favourite in a disappointing three-runner field but he has 1lb in hand of Path Of Thunder, the market leader, on ratings and showed his best recent turf form when making the running at Goodwood last summer. He could be tough to pass if David Probert gets a soft lead.\n\nSandown: 3.00 Nube Negra was 12 lengths behind Greaneteen in the Tingle Creek but is still the narrow favourite here with most bookies. That is surely a result of Greaneteen\u2019s poor run at Leopardstown in February, but he should be fresher for a two-month break and is returning to a track that plays to his strengths.\nWestover clings on for Classic Trial triumph\nWestover just held off the late challenge of Cash to win the Bet365 Classic Trial by a short head at Sandown on Friday, and the two colts are now quoted at 25-1 and 20-1 respectively to win the Derby at Epsom on 4 June.\nCash was very weak in the market before the Group Two contest \u2013 in which Adayar, the subsequent Derby winner, finished second 12 months ago \u2013 and David Simcock\u2019s grey was also reluctant to go into the stalls. He was then settled in last place by Jamie Spencer as Goldspur, the 6-5 favourite, made the running under William Buick.\nGoldspur could not respond when Westover grabbed the lead inside the final furlong, however, as Spencer launched a late challenge on Cash from a couple of lengths further off the pace. Cash found a sharp turn of foot as they raced uphill in the closing stages but the line arrived just in time for Ralph Beckett\u2019s colt.\n\n\u201cHe looked a little green again today, so if there was a race that fitted well into the programme, then I\u2019d say another run might be no harm,\u201d Barry Mahon, European racing manager for the Juddmonte operation, said afterwards. \u201cHe is a horse we have always regarded as [a possible] Epsom horse and today has probably shown he is on the road, so hopefully he can stay in one piece and continue to improve.\u201d\nEmily Upjohn, a daughter of the Derby and Arc winner Sea The Stars, ran away with the fillies\u2019 novice event later on the card and was immediately cut to around 8-1 third-favourite for the Oaks at Epsom on 3 June."

                    "body": "Trent Alexander-Arnold has said his appetite for silverware has only increased after becoming the youngest player to win all six major trophies available to an English club. Liverpool\u2019s FA Cup victory on Saturday ensured that, at the age of 23 years and 219 days, Alexander-Arnold has won the Champions League, Premier League, FA Cup, League Cup, Club World Cup and Uefa Super Cup.  Before Liverpool\u2019s win at Wembley only Ryan Giggs, Denis Irwin, James Milner, C\u00e9sar Azpilicueta and Andreas Christensen had completed that sextuple. Only Cristiano Ronaldo, when aged 23 years and 109 days, won the Champions League, Premier League, FA Cup and League Cup at a younger age than Liverpool\u2019s gifted right-back. \u201cIt feels special,\u201d said Alexander-Arnold, who made his first-team debut less than six years ago. \u201cGrowing up you never think you will win all these trophies. You see legendary players who do that and you think it is unbelievable. To be able to say I have done that at such a young age is a dream come true and it is motivation to go on and carry on winning more trophies. \u201cHopefully there is a lot more to come. The motivation is to win them all again and keep winning and keep adding to the trophy cabinet. \u201cDays like Saturday help me. I think it comes from within and thinking about what I want my legacy to be and where I think my potential is as a player. The sky is the limit really, so I want to push on and never be satisfied. I will keep my head down, try and win more trophies and hopefully at the end of my career I can be proud of what I have done.\u201d The FA Cup triumph against Chelsea also completed the set for J\u00fcrgen Klopp, who became the first manager in Liverpool\u2019s rich history to win the European Cup, league title, FA Cup and League Cup. Liverpool could yet add the Premier League and Champions League to this season\u2019s trophy haul and Alexander-Arnold credited a fellow member of the sextuple club, Milner, with maintaining high standards inside the dressing room.  \u201cHe is someone who keeps us all on our toes, he is massive in that dressing room,\u201d Alexander-Arnold said of the 36-year-old, who is out of contract this summer but has been offered a one-year extension by Liverpool. \u201cHe is one of the biggest characters I have been around and it is credit to him. \u201cIt is no surprise he has carried on winning everywhere he goes because he is relentless in what he does. He instils that mentality in us and he embodies that. Five years ago if anyone had told me I would achieve what I have achieved I don\u2019t know what I would have said. It is very special and, hopefully, in five more years I am in an even better place than I am now. It has not gone too bad so far. Five or 10 years\u2019 time and we will hopefully be talking about bigger and better things.\u201d Liverpool have won three consecutive finals against Chelsea on penalty shootouts and with a different goalkeeper in each one \u2013 Alisson in the FA Cup, Caoimhin Kelleher in the Carabao Cup and Adri\u00e1n in the 2019 Super Cup. \u201cThree different goalkeepers, three times winners. I said that in the changing room,\u201d the goalkeeping coach, John Achterberg, said. \u201cThat is what you want. You need a little bit of luck as well as hard work. It makes all our day.\u201d Achterberg described Alisson\u2019s performance at Wembley as \u201coutstanding, awesome\u201d. Klopp dedicated the trophy to neuro11, the company which has worked with Liverpool for the past year on penalty technique, but the goalkeeping coach insists ultimate responsibility for the team\u2019s spot-kick success remains with the players. \u201cWe work on things but in the end Ali makes the final decision,\u201d Achterberg said. \u201cWe discuss everything. They have all been practising a lot on penalties this season. Obviously the guys from Germany came to work with them specifically, but more and more players have been practising after training and getting confidence. It is a big credit to them all because it is big pressure to take one. You win as a team. We analyse all these things and there is a lot of work that goes on behind the scenes.\u201d"

                    "body": "G7 leaders appeared to sidestep imposing a price cap on Russian oil within weeks to strip Russia of its largest source of income to finance its war effort in Ukraine. The leaders of the world\u2019s leading western economies have promised a cap before, most recently at a meeting of G7 finance ministers on 2 September, with the plan pencilled to come into force on 5 December. But the latest G7 statement made only the most passing general comment about \u201ccontinuing to cooperate to ensure energy security and affordability across the G7 and beyond\u201d. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, had urged the meeting to impose a tough price cap calling for \u201czero profit for the terrorist state\u201d. The G7\u2019s terse reference reflects doubts inside the EU, principally Germany, about the wisdom of the scheme, and how it could work alongside a still to be agreed EU scheme to impose a gas price cap. There has been concern that Russia would ban all energy exports to any country implementing the price cap, forcing oil prices higher, and putting a heavier Russian squeeze on Europe to reduce its support for Ukraine\u2019s war aims. Tuesday\u2019s G7 meeting had originally been convened to discuss the price cap, and annexation of Donbas, but its focus was shifted by this week\u2019s Russian missile assault on Ukraine\u2019s infrastructure. Three states, the US, UK and Canada, have already stopped importing Russian oil, and the EU agreed in May to ban all imports of Russian seaborne crude from 5 December and all Russian refined products from 5 February. Pipeline flows were to be exempted for a period to give time to help Germany and Poland, but already Russia had lost three-fifths of its seaborne crude sales to Europe. The G7 price cap would in practice sit alongside the EU import ban, but allow EU states to transport oil to third countries only if the oil is sold at or below a yet to be announced fixed price. Germany fears that Russia, on the basis of its recent actions, will carry out its threat not to supply any energy to countries imposing a cap. It also thinks other importers of Russian oil, such as India, China and Turkey, are unlikely to agree to participate in the scheme, making it less effective. Speaking on Tuesday, Olaf Scholz, the German chancellor, said he favoured \u201ca negotiated process\u201d involving countries such as South Korea as well as the EU and the G7 to get prices down to a reasonable level. According to Russia\u2019s central bank, exports of its crude oil accounted for \u20ac113bn (\u00a399bn) in revenues in 2021, on top of the \u20ac70bn (\u00a362bn) earned from refined products such as gasoline and diesel. Income from the oil industry was around \u20ac102bn (\u00a390bn) in the first six months of the war. Despite the scepticism among economists, the US Treasury secretary, Janet Yellen, has said an international price cap \u201cwill help deliver a major blow for Russian finances and will both hinder Russia\u2019s ability to fight its unprovoked war in Ukraine and hasten the deterioration of the Russian economy\u201d. The US Treasury is still pitching the scheme to the global south by estimating that capping the price of Russian oil at the international level would result in $160bn billion (\u20ac165bn, \u00a3145bn ) in annual savings for the 50 largest emerging economies. The G7 price cap would be enforced by preventing insurance being provided to Russian cargoes if the oil is being sold above a still-undefined G7 limit. Officials have hinted at $40-$60 (\u00a336-\u00a354) a barrel. The G7 estimates that about 95% of the global oil tanker fleet is covered by shipping insurers in G7 countries, namely Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the UK and the US. The scheme\u2019s two chief problems are first ensuring the price is set at a level that entices Russia to continue trading with the G7 albeit at a lower price, and second preventing Russia diverting its oil sales to non-G7 countries, notably India, Turkey and China. Advocates of the scheme, chiefly the US, say it would still be worthwhile if countries like India continued to buy Russian oil since it would have to be sold at a discounted price. The G7 scheme has been hindered by a linked and heated argument within the EU over whether to impose a gas price cap. Spain and Portugal have already introduced a price cap on gas used for electricity with the state subsidising the generators for lost income. Germany is opposed since it fears a price cap will stimulate demand, leading to shortages, as well as incentivise gas producers like Norway, Qatar and the US to look for different, more profitable markets outside the EU. But the EU Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, is backing a temporary price cap followed by wider electricity market reforms. There is no agreement on whether the cap should be imposed on long-term contracts, on gas used to produce electricity and on all, not just Russian, gas trades. Countries would also need to decide how to compensate gas plants for the gap between the capped price and the higher market price at which they buy fuel, be it through public funding or a levy on other energy generators. With EU heads of government due to discuss the issue next week, the G7 scheme cannot be finalised even though the idea has been in circulation since June. Most energy experts such as the International Energy Authority say the EU can get through the winter without major blackouts because storage is at about 90% capacity, but they are less confident about the winter of 2023."

                    "body": "  6.06pm    And here\u2019s the match report:      6.04pm    Right, and with that, I\u2019ll bid you good evening, at the end of a pretty decent Scottish season. The three domestic trophies went to three different teams, and one team reached a European final. They\u2019re the ones celebrating tonight. Congratulations Rangers, commiserations Hearts. Thanks for following, and why not catch up with Rob again for another final? Bye.      5.47pm    The veteran Allan McGregor\u2019s getting a tad misty-eyed as he applauds the Rangers fans on the lap of honour. What a stalwart he has been. If it is his swansong, it\u2019s a memorable and appropriate one.     5.40pm    Up come the despondent Hearts players, led by Craig Gordon, to collect their medals, along with their impressive manager, Robbie Neilson. There\u2019s some booing from someone or other for something or other, before James Tavernier leads his mates up, shaking hands with Ally McCoist en route to meet Rangers legend John Greig, cram all his teammates and manager onto the tight podium area and hoist the trophy!      5.35pm    Cheers Rob. As a bit of pyro lights up the Rangers end, as is the modern way, and the Rangers players cavort in front of them. It\u2019s a first Scottish Cup since 2009, which constitutes a proper drought in Old Firm terms. The Hearts ends is emptying out a tad; they were out on their feet by the end, but they\u2019ve progressed impressively this season, and are well placed to establish themselves as Scotland\u2019s third force.     5.29pm   Full time: Rangers 2-0 Hearts  Rangers have won the Scottish Cup for the 34th time! It took a while, but ultimately they were too good - and too fit - for Hearts. The match was settled by two fine goals from the substitutes Ryan Jack and Scott Wright at the start of extra-time. Hearts gave everything, and will wonder what might have happened had Ellis Simms scored instead of hitting the post early on, but by the end they were well beaten. The fact their best players were Craig Gordon and John Souttar tells a story. Those two were heroic. I have to dash off to cover the Champions League final, but Tom Davies will bring you reaction from Hampden. Thanks, bye!  Updated at 5.31pm BST    5.28pm    120 min Kent and Kamara are both denied by Craig Gordon, the (relatively) young Hearts keeper. He\u2019s had a terrific game.     5.27pm    119 min: Rangers substitution A lovely bit of sentimentality from Giovanni van Bronckhorst: he brings on the goalkeeper Allan McGregor, aged 40, to play in a Scottish Cup final for the first time. All the Rangers substitutes are on their feet to applaud McGregor.  Updated at 5.28pm BST    5.23pm    117 min Simms\u2019 volley from the edge of the area deflects wide. The corner is cleared without fuss.     5.21pm    113 min This is a long 15 minutes of the soul for the Hearts players, who have no choice but to drag their weary legs around the pitch despite it being an exercise in futility.      5.18pm    111 min Wright charges infield and then plays the ball back outside to Sakala, whose low shot is smartly saved by Gordon. He probably should have scored. Wright has been such a threat since coming on in the second half of normal time.     5.17pm    110 min Rangers are passing the ball round, savouring that magical little window when you know something great is about to happen but it hasn\u2019t been confirmed.     5.14pm    106 min Craig Halkett is booked for fouling Sakala. Hearts look finished. They\u2019ve given everything, and were excellent in the first half, but at some point in the second half it started to become too much.     5.12pm    106 min The second period of extra-time is under way. Fashion Sakala has replaced Joe Aribo for Rangers, and Aaron McEneff is on for Cammy Devlin in the Hearts midfield.     5.11pm   Half time in extra time: Rangers 2-0 Hearts  Rangers are on course for victory after two fine goals from Ryan Jack and Scott Wright. I suppose it\u2019s apt, with all the fatigue and injuries, that the game should be decided by a couple of substitutes.     5.09pm    104 min I\u2019ll have what Calvin Bassey\u2019s having. He\u2019s played four hours of football since Wednesday evening and he is still charging up and down the left like it\u2019s the first day of the season. Likewise Ryan Kent, who zips infield and shoots over from 25 yards.      5.06pm    103 min \u201cMatt Dony has some nerve talking about penalties in Scotland v Wales World Cup play-offs,\u201d says Simon McMahon. \u201cThe most blatant handball you\u2019ll ever see by Dave Jones at Anfield in 1977, and yet Wales fans are still banging on about it 45 years later\u2026\u201d      5.05pm    101 min Hearts know it\u2019s over, still they cling, they don\u2019t know where else they can go.     5.02pm    The substitute Scott Wright has made it 2-0 after a ruthless counter-attack from Rangers. It was three v two, with Kent on the ball. He played it outside to Wright, who took a touch and drove the ball unerringly into the far corner. Gordon had no chance. His first touch wasn\u2019t the best, actually; but the second was immaculate. Wright, who had a disappointing night in Seville, has played really well since coming on.  Updated at 5.03pm BST    5.00pm   GOAL! Rangers 2-0 Hearts (Wright 97)  Rangers are heading for their first Scottish Cup in 13 years!   Updated at 5.08pm BST    4.59pm    95 min There\u2019s no doubt Rangers deserve to be ahead. The first half was even but since then it has been pretty one-sided.     4.59pm    94 min \u201cMORE extra time for Rangers?\u201d sniffs John Cropp. \u201cI can hear my dad now: \u2018GIE\u2019S a BREAK Rangers!!!\u2019 Here\u2019s to three for the Gers in the next five minutes so we can FINALLY get the celebration under way!\u201d Will one do?     4.59pm    Tavernier\u2019s corner from the left was headed away to the edge of the D, where Jack controlled the ball deftly and thrashed a rising drive past Gordon. It hit the underside of the bar and flew into the net. I think Gordon was unsighted, because it went straight above his head. He appealed for handball after the goal, though there didn\u2019t seem to be any hint of that on the replay.  Updated at 5.11pm BST    4.57pm   GOAL! Rangers 1-0 Hearts (Jack 93)  Ryan Jack has smashed Rangers into the lead!   Updated at 5.02pm BST    4.56pm    92 min: Chance for Rangers Another outstanding cross from Bassey is headed over by the stretching Aribo, six yards out. That\u2019s another terrific chance - not quite as good as Diallo\u2019s in the first half, but still eminently takeable.     4.55pm    92 min \u201cBle mae Ramsey?\u201d says Matt Dony. \u201cThere a large but petty part of me looking forward to a potential Wales v Scotland World Cup playoff, with Ramsey Panenkaing the winning penalty in a shootout. Football really does turn us into bad people sometimes. If he\u2019s not going to get onto the pitch, then come on Hearts!\u201d     4.54pm    91 min Extra time is under way.     4.50pm   Full time: Rangers 0-0 Hearts  For the second time in four days, Rangers are going to extra time.     4.50pm    90+3 min That was such a brilliant save from Gordon, though Rangers will legitimately argue that they should have had a penalty. It wasn\u2019t a subtle shirt pull from Atkinson, more a partial disrobing.     4.49pm    90+3 min: Wright hits the bar! Tavernier\u2019s free-kick from the right is headed onto the top of the bar by Scott Wright! He did well to get in front of Kingsley and help it across goal, but he couldn\u2019t get the ball to dip under the bar.     4.48pm    90+1 min: What a save from Gordon! That is sensational goalkeeping! Aribo received a pass on the half turn in the area, ignored a blatant shirt pull from Atkinson - that could have been a penalty - and hit a low drive towards the far corner. Gordon, whose weight was slightly the wrong way, thrust out his left leg to divert the ball just past the post.   Updated at 4.49pm BST    4.47pm    90 min Three added minutes. The Hearts players look absolutely shattered.     4.46pm    90 min Rangers break, with Kent playing in the overlapping Bassey on the left side of the area. His cross is cleared at the near post, and I won\u2019t insult your intelligence by telling you which Hearts defender was responsible.     4.45pm    89 min ... and swing it straight into McLaughlin\u2019s hands.      4.45pm    88 min Ginnelly gives the Hearts defence a breather by winning a corner, then conducts the Hearts end before it is taken. Kingsley will swing it in from the right...     4.44pm    87 min Ryan Jack curls over from distance. It was an ambitious attempt.     4.43pm    87 min Hearts are hanging on for extra-time. They look really tired now.     4.42pm    85 min Wright lays the ball back invitingly to Lundstram, whose crisp drive from 25 yards is brilliantly blocked by Souttar. He and Bassey have been magnificent.     4.41pm    84 min: Chance for Rangers! Tavernier swings the resulting corner to the near post, where Balogun gets the run on Souttar and flashes a header just over the bar. It brushed the roof of the net rather than hitting the back of it.     4.40pm    83 min Kent\u2019s cross is headed behind by the leaping Souttar, who has had an extremely good game.      4.38pm    82 min: Hearts substitution Josh Ginnelly replaces Barrie McKay, who faded after a bright start.     4.38pm    81 min: Double substitution for Rangers Glen Kamara and Ryan Jack replace Steven Davis and Scott Arfield in midfield.  Ramsey oh, Ramsey oh, where art thou Ramsey? Oh.     4.36pm    79 min Bassey beats Halliday with a Cruyff turn and is brought down in the eyes of everybody except Willie Collum. Bassey has had a sensational game.     4.33pm    77 min \u201cTo avoid the \u2018heartbreak\u2019 of a penalty \u2018lottery\u2019, maybe if cup finals are still level after 120 minutes the trophy should just be \u2018withheld\u2019, like the Scottish Cup was in 1909,\u201d says Simon McMahon. \u201cThen Gerry Scott would get his wish and both teams really would lose. And we could replace \u2018neither team deserved to lose\u2019 with \u2018neither team deserved to win\u2019.\u201d     4.32pm    76 min: Hearts substitution Andy Halliday replaces Liam Boyce, who has had a good game and must still be feeling the injury he sustained last weekend.     4.32pm    75 min: Good save from Gordon! Bassey takes matters into his own hands and almost gives Rangers the lead. He surges past McKay, cuts inside Souttar on the edge of the area and slides a right-footed shot that is pushed away by Gordon, scrambling low to his left.      4.30pm    74 min Aribo flashes a dangerous ball across the six-yard box. A number of Hearts players were doubtful for this game, or have just come back from injury, and that might be starting to catch up with them. Rangers have been much the better team in the second half.     4.28pm    72 min Wright plays a good one-two with Aribo on the edge of the area, forcing Kingsley to come across and make a vital interception. Excellent defending.  Updated at 4.28pm BST    4.27pm    71 min Boyce and Atkinson have been a big threat down the right in the last 5-10 minutes. Atkinson is fouled by Kent around 45 yards from goal. McKay\u2019s free-kick is a stinker, claimed easily by McLaughlin.     4.25pm    69 min See 56 min.     4.23pm    67 min \u201cWhat is the process for a draw at full time?\u201d says Joe Pearson. \u201cExtra time then penalties? Or is this cup different?\u201d Yep. Yep to the second question, that is. No to the third.      4.23pm    66 min Boyce flicks a clever return pass to Atkinson, who surges into the area from the right and drives a cross that is blocked by Davis.      4.22pm    65 min A rare Hearts attack, at least in the second half. Atkinson has space on the right and curls a lovely cross that just evades the leaping Simms at the near post.     4.20pm    63 min: Rangers substitution Scott Wright replaces Amad Diallo, who did some good things but also missed Rangers\u2019 best chance.     4.19pm    63 min It\u2019s getting hot out there. Kent is unhappy after being penalised for a challenge on Boyce, and the usually undemonstrative van Bronckhorst waves his hands around on the touchline.     4.19pm    63 min \u201cAnyone else think these missed chances will now end in glorious failure for the Hearts?\u201d says Paul Cowan. \u201cToo early?\u201d Way too early, and way too 0-0.     4.18pm    61 min Diallo is late again, this time on McKay, and gets a final warning from Willie Collum. He might have slipped, in his defence, though some referees would have given him a second yellow for that. One way or another, Diallo is going off: Scott Wright is getting ready.     4.16pm    60 min That was an excellent chance for Kent, though the ball over the top wasn\u2019t the easiest to control on the run. The proximity of Gordon and Atkinson meant he had almost no margin for error.     4.15pm    59 min Diallo is booked for a lunge at Boyce.     4.15pm    58 min: Fine save from Gordon! Diallo, just inside his own half, angles a superb pass over the top to find Kent in the area. His first touch is slightly heavy and that allows Gordon to smother his shot.    Updated at 4.40pm BST    4.12pm    56 min We say this in approximately 100 per cent of association football contests, but the first goal feels crucial today.     4.10pm    55 min \u201cAll these Kumbayas are getting to me,\u201d says Gerry Scott. \u201cI hope they both lose.\u201d Now that\u2019s what I call an MBM email.     4.09pm    54 min Diallo\u2019s teasing cross is headed away superbly, if a little desperately, by Souttar. It\u2019s been all Rangers since half-time.      4.09pm    52 min Bassey beats three players on the left, a run that includes a Zidane-style roulette, before his cross is blocked. On Wednesday night he was Rangers\u2019 best defender; today he\u2019s been their best attacker.     4.05pm    48 min Rangers have made a fast start to the second half, winning a couple of corners in the first three minutes. Nothing comes from either, though.     4.03pm    47 min \u201cWhen you said Simms hit the post,\u201d says John Lockhart, \u201cI thought you meant with the ball, not his own body.\u201d The ball hit the post as well, didn\u2019t it? Or is my neurodegeneration gathering pace?     4.02pm    46 min Peep peep! Hearts begin the second half. No changes on either side. \u201cI\u2019m probably not the furthest away from Guardian Towers in ... New Malden,\u201d says Donald Cameron. \u201cA Gers fan so hope they can do it, but it would be great for Hearts and Scottish football if the glory is spread about a bit.\u201d What\u2019s with all this generosity of spirit today? Have you all been asleep since June 2016?     3.57pm    \u201cWatching from Utah,\u201d says Mark Crowder. \u201cBig shoutout to my brother-in-law Phil who made the journey from London to Seville this week and is probably back home in Glasgow for this one.\u201d  While we\u2019re doing shoutouts, both big and small, can I recommend a couple of books: the 50 Greatest Rangers Games by Martyn Ramsay and We Made Them Angry: Scotland at the 1982 World Cup by Tom Brogan.     3.46pm   Half time: Rangers 0-0 Hearts  After one second of added time, Willie Collum blows the whistle for half-time. It\u2019s tight, tense and goalless at Hampden. Both teams have had one excellent chance - Ellis Simms hit the post for Hearts, Amad Diallo headed over from six yards for Rangers.   Updated at 3.47pm BST    3.45pm    44 min How good is Calvin Bassey? That question could be rhetorical or interrogative.    Updated at 3.52pm BST    3.43pm    42 min: What a chance for Amad! Rangers should be ahead. Calvin Bassey, who is having another stormer, curls a beautiful, dipping cross to the far post, where Amad makes a good run inside Cochrane but then heads over from six yards.  Updated at 3.45pm BST    3.42pm    40 min Tavernier, who has committed a few fouls today, gets a last warning from Willie Collum after bringing down Cochrane.   Updated at 3.42pm BST    3.41pm    40 min There was a scare for Hearts a moment ago when Liam Boyce started limping. He seems okay now, though he hasn\u2019t yet had to run at full pelt.     3.40pm    39 min \u201cApropos of nothing, I actually attended an Edinburgh derby at Easter Road back in 2012 on my only trip to Scotland,\u201d says Joe Pearson. \u201cGreat atmosphere!\u201d      3.39pm    38 min: Chance for Aribo! Kent plays a simple pass to the overlapping Bassey on the left. He teases a really good cross towards Aribo, who gets in front of Halkett but can only flick a header across goal on the stretch. On reflection it wasn\u2019t the easiest chance.     3.38pm    36 min \u201cHow is Amad doing?\u201d says Hans Petter Hustveit. \u201cAs a United supporter I had high hopes, and it has been another disappointment from a pretty dire season. It sort of confirmed that the young man showed flashes, but had not the prerequisite physical requirements to flourish in British football.  \u201cHowever, I did read Rangers supporters say he had developed positively as the season has progressed, and that he now seems to have adapted to the level of Scottish topflight - and he\u2019s also very, very young still. Do you feel you can see the beginnings of an end product that Erik ten Hag could develop into real quality?\u201d There\u2019s plenty to like about him, and he plays with a perky mischief, but if I was betting the farm I\u2019d say he won\u2019t make it at United. He\u2019s really young, though, as you say, so we\u2019re in William Goldman territory. At the same age Cristiano Ronaldo was a showpony (sic) and Theo Walcott was a future superstar.     3.35pm    34 min Davis releases Aribo in the inside-left channel, one v one with his future teammate Souttar. He shifts the ball to the side and drives a shot that is well blocked by Souttar. That was good, calm defending.     3.33pm    33 min It\u2019s been an even first 33 minutes. Rangers have had more of the ball but Hearts came closest to scoring when Ellis Simms hit the post.     3.32pm    32 min \u201cGood morning from the colonies Sir Rob!\u201d chirps James Thomas. \u201cI do have a subscription to ESPN+ \u2026 for now, in order to follow Fulham. But, of course, I\u2019ll be changing that to peacock, or whatever NBC\u2019s PL streaming channel is. Getting a bit of Scottish footy here in the States is a rare treat indeed! Carry on sir!\u201d     3.32pm    31 min A snapshot from Simms hits a Rangers defender. Then McKay goes on a dangerous run into the Rangers area before being dispossessed by Diallo.     3.31pm    31 min \u201cHi Rob, watching from Dublin on holiday from Edinburgh,\u201d says Nora Casey. \u201cThank you for your service. \u2018Mon the Hearts!\u201d     3.31pm    30 min Souttar marches forward imperiously and gives the ball to Simms. He carefully tees up McKay, who blooters over from the edge of the D.     3.29pm    29 min \u201cYup, following along from Canada as well,\u201d says Fred Decker. \u201cKeeping one eye on the Sunderland MBM and one on Rangers, the latter in honour of longtime Canadian international Scott Arfield. I know he\u2019s a Scot born and bred, but I don\u2019t make the rules of international football (just as well, really).\u201d     3.28pm    27 min Now Kent shoots a few yards wide from the edge of the area. Rangers are having a decent spell.     3.27pm    26 min The first shot on target comes from Rangers. Diallo teases a low cross into Davis in the area; he lays it back to Arfield, whose first-time shot is straight at Gordon.  Updated at 3.28pm BST    3.25pm    25 min \u201cMonitoring from Sassari in Sardinia,\u201d says Robert B. \u201cI am a Hibs fan but hope that Hearts win.\u201d I\u2019m confident that such generosity of spirit is shared by at least 0.001 per cent of your fellow Hibs supporters.     3.24pm    23 min At the other end, Bassey\u2019s cross is miscontrolled on the bounce by Aribo. With a better first touch he would have had a shot at goal. It wasn\u2019t the easiest ball to take though.  Updated at 3.24pm BST    3.23pm    22 min McKay lobs a dangerous ball towards Boyce on the edge of the area. He doesn\u2019t quite read the bounce, though, and Rangers are able to clear. The Hearts front three of McKay, Boyce and Simms look lively.     3.22pm    20 min \u201cI\u2019ll be following you Rob,\u201d says Paul Byatt. \u201cGot a soft spot for Hearts. Who hasn\u2019t?\u201d Well\u2026     3.20pm    19 min It\u2019s been an enjoyable first 20 minutes. Hearts haven\u2019t bent the knee at all, and as a result it\u2019s a pretty open game.     3.19pm    17 min \u201cLonely?\u201d asks Bartholomew Baker. \u201cYes, I\u2019m monitoring the Scottish Cup on the Guardian from the States. This is the only way to \u2018watch\u2019 since I\u2019m not ready to subscribe to ESPN+.\u201d Call it what you will - narcissism, self-absorption, egomania - but I always feel better when I know somebody is reading.     3.16pm    15 min A long, crossfield pass is controlled magnificently in mid-air by Diallo. He gets away from Cochrane and slides a low cross that is booted away in the six-yard box. Moments later, a loose ball falls to Arfield just inside the area. He thrashes a shot that is brilliantly blocked at full stretch.     3.15pm    13 min We\u2019ve just seen a replay of that Simms chance. He went with his wrong foot, the right, and that might have cost him a goal. There was no need to go with his stronger foot because all he had to do was make contact.     3.12pm    10 min: Simms hits the post! A great chance for Hearts. Atkinson played a clever through pass to Boyce, whose mistimed shot almost turned into a perfect cross for Simms. He slid desperately towards the ball but could only poke it off the outside of the post from close range. That was a really good chance for Boyce, never mind Simms.   Updated at 3.22pm BST    3.10pm    10 min Anyone out there?     3.10pm    9 min Goldson plays an outstanding long pass inside Kingsley to find Tavernier on the right. He lofts a cross towards Aribo but it\u2019s too deep.     3.09pm    8 min Bassey, playing at left-back today, wins the first corner of the match. Diallo\u2019s ball in is cleared by Souttar, who will be joining Rangers in the summer.     3.08pm    6 min This has been a good start from Hearts. McKay, who looks lively, can\u2019t quite control a pass on the edge of the area and that allows Balogun to clear.  Updated at 3.08pm BST    3.06pm    5 min After a confident run from Boyce, Sims\u2019 shot on the turn is blocked by Bassey. That\u2019s the first attempt at goal.     3.04pm    3 min An early yellow card for Peter Haring, who overran the ball and then took a shortcut through Calvin Bassey.      3.02pm    1 min A couple of fouls in the first 53 seconds, one on Lundstram and one by him. Terrific stuff.     3.01pm    1 min Peep peep! Rangers kick off from left to right as we watch.     3.00pm    \u201cNot surprised to see multiple changes made by GVB after Wednesday,\u201d says Simon McMahon. \u201cFatigue could well play a part, emotional as much as physical, especially as the game progresses. But at least Rangers won\u2019t have the second leg of the Europa League final to play in midweek, eh? That would just be crazy.\u201d  Updated at 3.00pm BST    2.59pm    There\u2019s a mighty roar around Hampden as the players walk onto the field. It\u2019s time for the Scottish Cup final of 2022.     2.49pm    A reminder of the teams Rangers (4-3-3) McLaughlin; Tavernier, Goldson, Balogun, Bassey; Arfield, Lundstram, Davis; Diallo, Aribo, Kent.Substitutes: McGregor, King, Jack, Ramsey, Kamara, Sands, Lowry, Itten, Wright, Roofe, Fashion Jr. Hearts (3-4-2-1) Gordon; Souttar, Halkett, Kingsley; Atkinson, Haring, Devlin, Cochrane; McKay, Boyce; Simms.Substitutes: Stewart, Smith, McEneff, Woodburn, Mackay-Smith, Moore, Halliday, Sibbick, Ginnelly.     2.46pm    Pre-match thoughts    Updated at 2.52pm BST    2.36pm    \u201cFavourite Gio van Bronckhorst goal?\u201d asks (and answers) Phil Podolsky. \u201cNever mind long-range screamers. He was at the business end of one of the great Barcelona team goals, a move that epitomizes \u2018probing\u2019, having also launched it with a throw-in.\u201d  I just had a look at the Barcelona team for that game, which included Xavi, Ronaldinho, Deco, Henrik Larsson, Carles Puyol, van Bronckhorst and Samuel Eto\u2019o. Meanwhile, Andres Iniesta and Lionel Messi were on the bench, and Rivaldo, Johan Cruyff and Diego Maradona didn\u2019t even make the squad.  Updated at 2.49pm BST    2.02pm   Team news  Giovanni van Bronckhorst has made five changes from the Europa League final. Jon McLaughlin, Leon Balogun, Steven Davis, Scott Arfield and Amad Diallo replace Allan McGregor, Borna Barisic, Glen Kamara, Ryan Jack and Scott Wright.  Barisic, who came off injured towards the end in Seville, hasn\u2019t made the squad.   Hearts had doubts over a few players but Robbie Neilson is able to pick a very strong XI. There are three changes from last week\u2019s league defeat to Rangers. John Souttar, Nathaniel Atkinson and Craig Halkett return in place of Michael Smith, Gary Mackay-Steven and Toby Sibbick. Crucially, Liam Boyce and Cammy Devlin are fit to start. It\u2019s a bit of a gamble from Robbie Neilson but, as every manager in the world seems to have told us in the last fortnight, this is the time for risk.   Updated at 2.50pm BST    1.56pm    Ewan Murray\u2019s match preview      1.56pm   Preamble  Hello and welcome to live coverage of the Scottish Cup final between Rangers and Hearts at Hampden. Hearts fans don\u2019t much care for remembering 1986, when they lost the league on the final day and turned up for the subsequent cup final in body but not mind. While that lost double is something Hearts fans will never truly get over, the heartbreaking circumstances might give them some added hope today. It\u2019s roughly 63 hours since Rangers lost the Europa League final on penalties to Eintracht Frankfurt on penalties. We\u2019re about to find out what that gruelling match and the despair of defeat have done to both their legs and their minds. If Rangers aren\u2019t close to their best today then Hearts, comfortably the best of the rest in Scotland this season, will make off with the glory.  Hearts have won this competition more recently than Rangers. They smashed Hibs 5-1 in the final in 2012, three years after Rangers beat Falkirk 1-0. Both teams have since experienced football\u2019s vicissitudes. Rangers went into administration and had to start again; Hearts have been relegated twice, most recently in controversial circumstances in 2020. The recovery of both clubs has been pretty admirable. While Rangers were romping the Premiership last season, Hearts were doing likewise in the Championship, though they were also humiliated by Brora Rangers in the Scottish Cup. They finished third in this season\u2019s Premiership, 13 points ahead of Dundee United in fourth, and now their young manager Robbie Neilson is hoping to join a small group who have won the Scottish Cup with the same club as player and manager. One thing Neilson\u2019s Hearts are yet to do is properly lay a glove on Rangers. In four league games this season they took only one point, and were beaten 3-1 by Rangers Reserves at Tynecastle last weekend. Today would be the perfect time to start punching upwards.  Kick off 3pm.  "

                    "body": "Turkey should face charges in front of the international court of justice for being complicit in acts of genocide against the Yazidi people, while Syria and Iraq failed in their duty to prevent the killings, an investigation endorsed by British human rights lawyer Helena Kennedy has said. The groundbreaking report, compiled by a group of prominent human rights lawyers, is seeking to highlight the binding responsibility states have to prevent genocide on their territories, even if they are carried out by a third party such as Islamic State (IS). The lawyers, grouped under the title of the Yazidi Justice Committee (YJC), said there was accountability under international law for states to prevent the crime of genocide under the Genocide Convention. Sir Geoffrey Nice QC, chair of the YJC, described the genocide of the Yazidi people as \u201cmadness heaped on evil\u201d. \u201cMechanisms in place could have saved the Yazidis from what is now part of their past, and part of their past partial destruction,\u201d he said.  It is widely accepted that genocide was attempted against the Yazidis, a religious minority, from 2013 in Iraq and Syria. The report, which followed a three-year inquiry that investigated the conduct of 13 countries, concluded three of them failed in their duty to take reasonable steps to prevent the genocide. In the case of Turkey, the committee went further by accusing its leaders of being complicit in the massacres, alleging it failed to police its borders to halt the free flow of IS fighters, including a significant number of Turkish nationals. Turkish officials have said the criticisms are baseless. The committee claimed that from April 2014, Turkish officials turned a blind eye to the sale, transfer and enslavement of Yazidi women and children, and helped train fighters affiliated with IS to fight its Kurdish enemies in Syria, so strengthening the perpetrators of the genocide.  \u201cTurkish officials knew and/or were wilfully blind to evidence that these individuals would use this training to commit prohibited acts against the Yazidis,\u201d the report said. The report noted similar allegations have been made against some Gulf states, including Qatar, but insufficient evidence was produced. The 278-page report acknowledged that by June 2014, Iraq had called on the UN to recognise the atrocities committed by IS, but accused the Iraqi government of not coordinating with Kurdish authorities or taking measures to evacuate the Yazidis to safety. Syria\u2019s government, the report alleged, failed to prevent the transfer and detention of enslaved Yazidis on its territory. The Turkish ambassador to the UK, \u00dcmit Yal\u00e7\u0131n, said the criticisms were baseless and unfair. He said Turkey \u201cstarting from the early years of the conflict in Syria played a key role in the protection of Syrian civilians and minorities, including Yazidis, in the region against the attacks and violations of terrorist groups.  \u201cTurkey not only opened its doors and became a safe heaven for millions of Syrians and Yazidis but also provided protection for the people of the region through three counter terrorism operations in Syria. Today Yazidis live peacefully in areas that are under the control of the legitimate Syrian opposition in north-western Syria.  \u201cMoreover, last year many Yazidi families that took refugee in north-western Syria tried to return to their homes in Syria\u2019s north-east but [were] prevented from doing so by PKK/YPG [the initials of the Kurdish groups in Turkey and Syria].\u201d Lady Kennedy, in her joint foreword with Lord Alton, said \u201can ocean of impunity exists in relation to the Yazidi genocide\u201d, noting that IS as a non-state actor cannot be prosecuted under international law.  Meanwhile, states had \u201cfailed to in their duty to address their responsibilities to prevent the genocide for a variety of inhumane reasons\u201d. If they are not held accountable, she wrote, \u201cthen the promise of \u2018never again\u2019 rings hollow\u201d."

                    "body": "Single-use plastic plates, cutlery and a range of other items will be banned in England from October, to curb their \u201cdevastating\u201d impact on the environment, the government has confirmed. The Department for the Environment said the ban will also cover single-use plastic bowls, trays and certain types of polystyrene cups and food containers. However, the move will not apply to plates, trays and bowls used as packaging in what the Department called \u201cshelf-ready pre-packaged food items\u201d. From October this year, the public will not be able to buy the banned items from retailers, takeaways or food vendors.  Under new legislation, it is expected the ban will be enforced through civil sanctions \u2013 but with the possibility of repeated breaches ending up in a criminal offence. The ban follows a consultation on the issue by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) that ran from November 2021 to February 2022. Figures suggest that every year England uses about 1.1bn single-use plates and 4.25bn pieces of such cutlery, only 10% of which are recycled after being used. According to research, plastic items relating to takeaway food and drink, including food containers and cutlery, make up the largest share of litter in the world\u2019s oceans. The environment, secretary Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Coffey, said: \u201cWe all know the absolutely devastating impacts that plastic can have on our environment and wildlife. \u201cWe have listened to the public and these new single-use plastics bans will continue our vital work to protect the environment for future generations. \u201cI am proud of our efforts in this area: we have banned microbeads, restricted the use of straws, stirrers and cotton buds and our carrier bag charge has successfully cut sales by over 97% in the main supermarkets.\u201d Similar bans have already been made in Scotland and Wales. The environment minister, Rebecca Pow, said that the government would also be \u201cpressing ahead\u201d with \u201cplans for a deposit-return scheme for drinks containers and consistent recycling collections in England\u201d. In addition to this, the government is considering whether other measures are needed to target other items that are regularly thrown away as litter, such as wet wipes, tobacco filters and sachets."

                    "body": "\u2018Everyone else doubted us,\u201d says Chloe Kelly. \u201cBut we all believed in ourselves. We believed in the group. We believed in our staff. We didn\u2019t for one minute ever feel sorry for ourselves. Even the games we lost we believe that we should have won because we have the talent in the group, no matter how many injuries we had.\u201d The Manchester City forward is talking on the eve of Sunday\u2019s FA Cup final against Chelsea at Wembley, with her team having finished third in the Women\u2019s Super League to claim the final Champions League spot. Having already won the Continental League Cup, it is impossible not to share her pride at City\u2019s incredible turnaround \u2013 and a recovery that mirrors her own struggles.  By mid-November, they had taken seven points from their first seven games, losing four times \u2013 as many as they had in the preceding three seasons combined. They were hampered by injuries, with a number of their Team GB players sidelined after returning from the Tokyo Olympics, including the club captain, Steph Houghton, the goalkeeper Ellie Roebuck and the Lionesses\u2019 record goalscorer, Ellen White. Kelly was out too, having torn a ligament in her right knee on 5 May in the penultimate game of the 2020-21 season. At one stage, City languished in ninth with the league title all but lost as Chelsea and Arsenal cantered ahead, their Champions League hopes diminishing. In that context a cup double would be a remarkable achievement, but for City, so used to fighting for the biggest prizes, it is not enough. \u201cThe Conti Cup was massive,\u201d says Kelly, who watched that game from the stands. \u201cAs a group we went into it with a lot of confidence, based on our performances since Christmas break. Going into it with confidence was great and the girls performed brilliantly, got our tactics right and it was a great day for us \u2013 but it just made us hungry to be even better. \u201cTo to be in the FA Cup final, winning the Conti Cup and qualifying for the Champions League, that\u2019s what this club should be doing, and fighting for titles as well. It\u2019s great to be in the Champions League next season but we want to win the WSL. So while we should be satisfied with what we got this season with the tough start, next season we have to be pushing for the league as well.\u201d Since that 3-1 defeat of Sunday\u2019s opponent\u2019s, Chelsea, in the League Cup final, City have welcomed back Kelly. The 24-year-old returned to action in a 2-0 victory against West Ham on 2 April, coming off the bench in the 59th minute. \u201cI\u2019ve enjoyed every minute of being back on the pitch,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd I\u2019m thankful to be getting as many minutes as I have. Off the back of an injury, it\u2019s not very likely to get as many minutes as I have done. But I don\u2019t want the season to end now. I\u2019m back on the pitch and it\u2019s a bit sad that the season\u2019s coming to an end.\u201d  The end to this season, though, is better than last. Her injury prevented her from taking her likely place on the plane to Tokyo and she had to watch from the sidelines as City struggled. It was \u201ca difficult time,\u201d she says. \u201cBeing injured and not being able to help the team in any way made the injury even tougher. It was just a case of getting through it and ticking off each day and having good people around you.\u201d  The perception of ACL [anterior cruciate ligament] injuries does not help the recovery process, she feels. \u201cI don\u2019t like the whole negative aura around the ACL. I feel like sometimes you go into that rehab with such a negative mindset because everyone speaks so negatively of having an ACL injury. \u201cPeople have overcome that injury in the past but the negative stories are the ones that always stick in your head. It was a tough time, but any injury is tough. You speak to [teammate] Esme Morgan, she\u2019s had tough times with her injury, which is a completely different injury to mine.\u201d Kelly spent much of her rehab away from the team, travelling to the US to work with the reconditioning expert Bill Knowles in Philadelphia. \u201cThat was really good for me,\u201d she says. \u201cIt gave me so much confidence in my movement and just a different side to the rehab. \u201cFocusing on the movements really benefited me, it gave me so much confidence. That\u2019s probably the hardest part to get. You have to really trust that area can take certain movements and then you build the strength off of that.\u201d It is the support in rehab she thinks has helped her slot back into the team with such ease. \u201cI was never, and I\u2019m still not, scared. Because I know that I\u2019ve put in so much effort and the people around me have put in so much effort,\u201d she says. \u201cI feel good on the pitch, I feel myself. I still think I\u2019m not back to my best, but I wasn\u2019t before my injury, I still had so much more to give.\u201d  Sign up to our new women\u2019s football newsletter!  Now she has one last chance to shine with City and do enough post-season to win a place in Sarina Wiegman\u2019s England squad for this summer\u2019s Euros. \u201cI\u2019ve hit the ground running quite well, with my stats as well, with the goals and assists that I\u2019ve got since coming back. I just want to finish the season strong in the FA Cup and then we\u2019ll see what happens in the summer.\u201d Kelly believes City can take heart from their defeat of Chelsea in the League Cup final. \u201cThey\u2019re not going to be the same Chelsea that we played in the Conti Cup but we\u2019re not the same team that they played either. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of confidence around the group, the football that we\u2019re playing at the minute is brilliant and we\u2019re all enjoying ourselves.\u201d"

                    "body": "1) Fabinho absence a key blow\nLiverpool\u2019s hopes of an unprecedented quadruple have taken several knocks in the past week, but they can significantly reduce the odds against them notching up a pretty decent treble with a win against Chelsea in the FA Cup final. Their chances would have been greatly increased had Fabinho been available but the Brazilian limped out of their win over Aston Villa with a soft tissue injury after 30 minutes and Liverpool immediately looked far more vulnerable. He\u2019s not expected to be back until the Champions League final. He is a vital presence in Liverpool\u2019s midfield and Chelsea\u2019s forwards will seriously fancy their chances of breaching their opponents\u2019 rearguard with the usual sentry not in front of it on patrol. BG\n\nChelsea v Liverpool, FA Cup final, Saturday 4.45pm\n\n\n2) Lukaku\u2019s low return against Liverpool\nBack in form with three goals in his past two games, Romelu Lukaku has given Thomas Tuchel plenty to think about before the Cup final. While it is hardly the most scientific approach to team selection, Chelsea\u2019s manager might want to bear in mind that Lukaku\u2019s record against Saturday\u2019s opponents is really not very good. In 19 appearances against Liverpool during his time at West Brom, Everton and Chelsea, he has scored only five goals and finished on the winning side three times. It is a record that is unlikely to inspire much in the way of confidence when the big decision is made. BG\n\nChelsea v Liverpool, FA Cup final, Saturday 4.45pm\n\n3) Everton must make hay against mid-table sides\n\u201cYou offer us seven points from Chelsea, Leicester and Watford, we bite your hand off,\u201d Frank Lampard said after Wednesday\u2019s stalemate at Vicarage Road. The mood is upbeat and encouragingly Everton have two games to come at Goodison Park against sides who are comfortable in mid-table. It\u2019s perhaps inaccurate to say Thomas Frank\u2019s men have \u201cnothing to play for\u201d but the challenge will surely be less determined than Everton would get from a side fighting for survival, or scrapping for Champions League qualification. On which note, Lampard must regard it as highly unlikely that they could go to Arsenal and win a week on Sunday. So in one sense Everton have two games to save themselves, starting with Brentford this Sunday and followed by Crystal Palace four days later. Two winnable matches \u2013 Premier League safety before the final day? Everton fans would bite your hand off. LM\n\nEverton v Brentford, Premier League, Sunday 4.30pm\n\n4) Rice tasked with derailing City\u2019s goal express\nThe capture of Erling Haaland is an ominous sign for Manchester City\u2019s rivals and the same would be true should Declan Rice head for the Etihad from the London Stadium. Arguably neither player feels like an entirely natural fit for City. Haaland\u2019s outrageous game has traditionally been about using his pace to get in behind defences rather than being a link in the chain of a possession-heavy side. Rice, meanwhile, lacks the silkiness of many recent Manchester City midfielders but, in theory at least, would bring the sort of defensive ballast that comes in handy while trying to win on multiple fronts. Manchester City have hammered in 10 goals in two matches since that painful Champions League exit at the hands of Real Madrid \u2013 and 19 in their previous four league games. Even Rice\u2019s dynamism in front of the West Ham defence seems unlikely to stop Pep Guardiola\u2019s goal machine. LM\n\nWest Ham v Manchester City, Premier League, Sunday 2pm\n\n\n5) Late arrivals due at Tottenham\nTottenham host Burnley in Sunday\u2019s midday kick-off, a match of of massive importance for both sides. Burnley fans who cannot afford an overnight stay in London but wish to travel by rail on the day will arrive in London midway through half-time if they take the first available train from Manchester Road Station on Sunday morning and it arrives on time. BT Sport\u2019s decision, taken in conjunction with the Premier League, to stage a noon kick-off for a match of such significance provides the latest in a long line of examples which showcase the almost total disregard and borderline contempt broadcasters and the organisers continue to show for match-going fans. BG\n\nTottenham v Burnley, Premier League, Sunday 12pm\n\n6) Leeds cannot afford to be conservative\nLeeds had Luke Ayling sent off in the 2-1 defeat at Arsenal and Dan James was shown a red card after 24 minutes in their latest loss, Wednesday\u2019s 3-0 reverse against Chelsea. They are not doing themselves many favours and if they are ultimately relegated those dismissals may be thought of as pivotal. But Jesse Marsch\u2019s approach in the coming days will be the most significant factor. The feeling among some fans is that he is overly conservative \u2013 predictable given he replaced the more attack-minded (some say reckless) Marcelo Bielsa \u2013 but Chelsea had looked uncharacteristically vulnerable in recent weeks. Perhaps an opportunity was missed to put Thomas Tuchel\u2019s men under pressure. It is safe to presume that inspirational quotes from Mahatma Gandhi and Muhammad Ali are not going to hold much sway with your average Premier League footballer. But could channelling Bielsa, and recognising that attack is often the best form of defence, deliver a priceless three points? LM\n\nLeeds v Brighton, Premier League, Sunday 2pm\n\n\n7) A farewell to Foster at Vicarage Road?\nOne of the few Watford players who can finish the season with his head held high, Ben Foster cut loose at his teammates after the club\u2019s relegation was confirmed last weekend. \u201cWe\u2019ve got too many players who are happy to put it in for an hour, 70 minutes, but then probably fall off and happily let it go in the last 20 minutes,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can\u2019t have that. When you\u2019re a team like us, the minimum is giving it everything you\u2019ve got.\u201d While Foster is too old and near the end of his contract to care about hurting the feelings of his fellow players with his justified criticism, they managed to rouse themselves enough to take a point from their dire midweek game against Everton. On Sunday they host Leicester as they bid to arrest a run of 12 games \u2013 11 consecutive defeats and a draw \u2013 without a win at home. Whatever the outcome, Foster deserves an ovation, as he has previously said he\u2019d like to finish his career in America, so this may well be his final game at Vicarage Road. BG\n\nWatford v Leicester, Premier League, Sunday 2pm\n\n8) More hidden gems from around south London?\nWith little at stake for either side as Aston Villa host Crystal Palace, Patrick Vieira has said he will use the run-in to start building for next season by giving some youngsters some top-flight experience. At the start of the campaign, the Palace owner, Steve Parish, named David Omilabu, Jesurun Rak-Sakyi and Malachi Boateng as the trio of academy graduates most likely to break into the first team this season, but only the midfielder Rak-Sakyi has had a run-out, for 14 minutes. Fitness permitting, Eagles fans may like to see more of the youngsters in Palace\u2019s three remaining games. BG\n\nAston Villa v Crystal Palace, Premier League, Sunday 2pm\n\n\n9) Will Smith rebuild Norwich to be more robust?\n\u201cWe\u2019re a team that\u2019s been recruited to play possession-based football, but unfortunately at this level we\u2019re coming up against teams who are going to be better than us with possession, at times.\u201d That was Dean Smith\u2019s honest assessment after relegated Norwich\u2019s latest defeat, 3-0 at Leicester on Wednesday. Smith\u2019s idea that Norwich, for all their ambition, simply lack the quality to play possession-focused football in the top flight was by extension a criticism of the club\u2019s recruitment and overall strategy before his arrival last November. Presumably, though, Smith will believe they have the ability to do it in the Championship. The suggestion seems to be that he will aim to introduce a more pragmatic approach with the aim of not just returning to, but surviving in, the Premier League. LM\n\n\nWolves v Norwich, Premier League, Sunday 2pm\n\n10) Newcastle can dream of next season\nAs Arsenal continue to battle for the top four, and while the relegation fight plays out a few places below them, Eddie Howe and Newcastle have the luxury of beginning to think about the 2022-23 campaign. Howe\u2019s intelligence and his managerial skill, honed over many years on the south coast plus a brief spell at Burnley in 2011-12, have proved a perfect fit in freeing the Magpies of worries about dropping down into the Championship. With a healthy level of investment in the squad to come in the summer \u2013 Yves Bissouma of Brighton and Leeds\u2019s Kalvin Phillips are both transfer targets \u2013 what will constitute success next season? The more upbeat Newcastle fans may even fancy that a charge for the top six is not out of the question, and a rare win against a side from that bracket would fuel their optimism. LM\n\nNewcastle v Arsenal, Premier League, Monday 8pm\n\n"

                    "body": "Which direction is Christian Pulisic going in? For most of his career, it was a question that preoccupied opposition defenders; more recently, it is one Pulisic has perhaps begun to ask himself. Pulisic is 23 years old, a player of rare poise and skill, by common consent the greatest male footballer to come out of the United States. Back home his face is used to sell energy drinks, computer games, burritos and peanut butter chocolates. The path to stardom has been blazed and beaten with an inexorable momentum. Now he\u2019s here, a Champions League winner at one of the biggest clubs in the world. And yet. Pulisic has started only 12 league games this season. A few days before this interview his father, Mark, went on Twitter to express \u2013 and then quickly retract \u2013 his disappointment at his son\u2019s treatment at Chelsea. The FA Cup semi-final, the Club World Cup final, the Champions League second leg against Real Madrid: Pulisic was left on the bench each time. \u201cThe sad thing is he loves this club, teammates, and London,\u201d Pulisic senior wrote. \u201cPuts his heart and soul into being a pro. Onwards and upwards my boy ... big six months ahead.\u201d  Naturally, the tweet set off all kinds of rumours and suspicions, mutters and grumbles. Alas, when the Guardian attempts to ask Pulisic about it, the interview is swiftly brought to a halt. Before that, however, he is both philosophical and commendably frank about his lack of opportunities this season. Obviously he wishes he could have played a little more. He admits that he has been played \u201call over the place\u201d this season under Thomas Tuchel. But he\u2019s still on board, still fighting. After all, there\u2019s a Cup final to be played, and precious little room for distractions. First, the big question: is he still happy at Chelsea? \u201cYeah. Of course, I want to be on the pitch. I enjoy this club a lot. I\u2019m hoping that I can get more opportunities.\u201d How does he win back a regular place? \u201cDo the absolute best I can in training, train hard and show him [Tuchel] on a daily basis that I\u2019m ready to play. And then of course on the pitch, I have to make an impact.\u201d Chelsea\u2019s trip to Elland Road on Wednesday night offered a further reminder of Pulisic\u2019s value. While Chelsea built another attack early in the second half, Pulisic actually took a couple of steps away from the Leeds goal, finding a little lacuna of space amid the retreating defence. Mason Mount\u2019s flick was exquisite; Pulisic\u2019s finish deadly; the points secured. Curiously, most of his eight goals this season have been late: the 64th minute on average. When the game is approaching its pivotal moment, when limbs and minds are beginning to tire, that\u2019s when Pulisic does his best work. It is why, even if he is unlikely to start at Wembley, he still has the capacity to leave his mark.  There is a theory that Pulisic suffers a little from his versatility, the sheer breadth of his skillset. Timo Werner is quicker, Mason Mount a better passer, Hakim Ziyech a better crosser, Kai Havertz a better finisher and more potent aerial threat. Perhaps this explains why Pulisic has been shunted around so often, from wing-back to No 10 to striker. Equally, he is clear on his best role. \u201cI\u2019m comfortable in a more attacking role, for sure,\u201d he says. \u201cAnywhere as a left-winger, on the left side, is where I feel most comfortable. I think there\u2019s been a lot of change this season.\u201d That change \u2013 on and off the pitch \u2013 may help to explain Chelsea\u2019s curiously intermittent form this season, one in which the early aspirations of a title challenge quickly evaporated. Champions League football has been all but secured for another season and yet for all their cup success \u2013 wins in the Super Cup and Club World Cup, and now a second domestic cup final \u2013 it feels an appropriate moment to ask Pulisic whether this is the season that got away.  He disagrees. \u201cOverall, we accomplished a lot,\u201d he says. \u201cWe put up a big fight in the Champions League. The Carabao Cup final, we put up an impressive performance [a defeat on penalties to Liverpool]. And now we have a chance in the FA Cup final. Win this, and I think we can say it\u2019s been a pretty successful season.\u201d There are prospective new owners at Stamford Bridge and a summer of upheaval in prospect. For Pulisic there are probably some honest conversations to be had, tough decisions to be made. But all of that can wait. Right now, the only direction Pulisic is heading is towards Wembley, and a chance to add another silver lining to an expanding body of work.

                    "body": "Sam Kerr loves the biggest stages. Few players thrive in the most intense spotlights but the Australian seems to feed off the pressure. \u201cI\u2019m a bit of a risk taker,\u201d says Kerr, who showboats on the pitch but is incredibly down-to-earth off it. \u201cI love that feeling of being on the edge and that\u2019s what those big moments are for.\u201d\nLast summer Kerr chested down a long ball and slotted past Ellie Roebuck with two minutes remaining to force extra time in Australia\u2019s quarter-final against Team GB at the Tokyo Olympics. Australia won 4-3, Kerr scoring their second and fourth goals. In December the 28-year-old scored twice in Chelsea\u2019s 3-0 demolition of Arsenal at Wembley to lift the Covid-postponed 2021 FA Cup.\n\n\u201cThat was one of the best experiences of my life, honestly,\u201d she says. \u201cJust the whole London derby thing was awesome to do at Wembley and having fans and friends and family back in the stadium after Covid times was really special.\u201d\nOn 21 January Kerr scored five times in Australia\u2019s 18-0 rout of Indonesia in their opening Asian Cup game, overtaking Tim Cahill as the country\u2019s record goalscorer.\nThe day after her return from the tournament in India, which she says \u201celevated her confidence\u201d, the forward came off the bench as a depleted Chelsea beat Manchester United 3-1 in the Continental League Cup semi-finals. Then, after a 0-0 draw with Arsenal that ensured Chelsea would win the league if they did not drop a point, Kerr\u2019s form was unsurpassed. She scored 11 goals across eight of the nine remaining league games, including a 90th-minute winner against Aston Villa and a nerve-easing swift opener against Everton three days later.\n\nThen she put 10-player Chelsea ahead against Tottenham as they came from behind to win 3-1. \u201cWe went down to 10 and I kid you not, in that changing room it was just calmness, no one\u2019s stressed,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019ve never been a part of the team like that. We didn\u2019t have one player stressing, the coach didn\u2019t stress, we all knew it was going to be fine.\u201d\nFour days later, in the reverse fixture, she scored the winner in a 2-1 defeat of Spurs. Finally, she hit two stylish and audacious volleys as Chelsea twice came from behind to take the WSL title on the final day with a 4-2 defeat of Manchester United. There was one thing she wasn\u2019t risking against United, her trademark backflip celebration not an option. \u201cI got too excited, and I can\u2019t do it when I\u2019m too excited; I\u2019ll break my back,\u201d she says with a laugh.\n\nOn Sunday, Kerr steps out at Wembley again, as Chelsea take on Manchester City, who beat them in the League Cup final, in this season\u2019s FA Cup final. \u201cI\u2019d play there every week if I could,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s a beautiful stadium. When the fans pack it out it\u2019s an amazing experience. Any time you go to Wembley it\u2019s an important game, so I love playing there. And look, sometimes it goes your way, sometimes it doesn\u2019t, but the most important thing is that I do everything this week so that I know that I\u2019ve done everything in my power to perform on the day.\u201d\nThere is an added boost on Sunday for Kerr. \u201cMy brother, two friends, my mum and dad and some family that live in Milton Keynes are coming,\u201d she says. \u201cThey all weren\u2019t going to come and then they thought: \u2018Stuff it, what are you saving your money for?\u2019 You never know when your next time at Wembley will be.\u201d\n\nKerr brims with confidence. After Chelsea lifted the title, she said that visualising scoring in the big moments was important to keeping her calm when those scenarios play out. Retaining a cool head is important because Kerr is more tightly marked than she was in the NWSL in the US or the W-League in Australia.\n\u201cThat\u2019s one of the reasons why I came to this league: because I wanted to expand my gameplay,\u201d she says. \u201cI am being closely marked here but if they\u2019re double-marking me or man-marking me then there\u2019s someone else free and that\u2019s the amazing thing about this team \u2013 everyone is allowed to be the best version of themselves on the field and if I\u2019m having a bad game normally someone else is having a worldie.\n\u201cThis league has made me better and it\u2019s made me transform into a different type of player, a smarter player. I love the challenge of it. That\u2019s why I love the big games: you get right on the cusp of doing something amazing and I love that feeling.\u201d\n\nSign up for our free women\u2019s football newsletter\n\nKerr is settled in London after two and a half seasons but could have been there sooner, having been tracked by Chelsea\u2019s manager, Emma Hayes. The opportunity to choose her destination was a strange one, with trading between NWSL teams without player input commonplace. \n\u201cMost of the time, at a new club I\u2019ve met the coach when I found out that they had traded for me, with that not always being my first option. But I spoke to Emma two years before I chose to come here. The year before I was close but then I chickened out a little bit. I thought: \u2018I\u2019ve got one more year to win some stuff in the NWSL.\u2019 I felt like I hadn\u2019t really closed that chapter yet.\u201d\nIn January 2020 the timing was right and Kerr got to see whether the manager she had spoken to was different from the one at training. \u201cOver the phone it was a little bit more serious,\u201d she says. \u201cShe was trying to impress me and I was trying to impress her. Once I visited Chelsea and got to actually meet her, the relationship relaxed a little bit.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s just really forward with me. I\u2019m not someone that likes to beat around the bush. She just tells me how it is, and I tell her how it is and we just have this mutual respect\u201d\nBoth teams on Sunday have momentum, City having clinched the third Champions League spot after an injury-affected first half of the season. \u201cWhenever there\u2019s a trophy on the line, this team lifts,\u201d says Kerr. \u201cI thought after the win on the weekend we\u2019d probably have a relaxation day but we\u2019ve been straight back into it, straight back to work, and that just shows where the club wants to go, where the team wants to go, and where individuals want to go.\u201d"

We love to play finals; the last FA Cup final, against Arsenal with the fans back, was unbelievable. We want to get there again.\u201d To get to Wembley this time, less than five months since they emphatically beat Arsenal there in last season\u2019s delayed final, Chelsea must defeat the Gunners again in Sunday\u2019s FA Cup semi-final at a sold-out Borehamwood. This season the two teams have been neck and neck, sharing hammer blows ever since Arsenal\u2019s 3-2 WSL opening-day victory over Chelsea at the Emirates Stadium. Chelsea lifted the FA Cup in December, then the teams battled to break the deadlock in a thrilling 0-0 draw at Kingsmeadow in the league before Emma Hayes\u2019s side leapfrogged Arsenal to reach the top of the table for the first time this season.  \u201cThat was a tough game and we felt a bit lucky after,\u201d says Reiten with a grin. \u201cEveryone knows everything about each other, so it\u2019s more difficult to work out how to beat them. Sometimes you have to change stuff, but that is up to Emma. We\u2019ve just got to go on the pitch with a lot of energy, be really aggressive and play our game and believe in ourselves, because both teams are so good. But I think, and I believe, that we are the best, and that\u2019s what we have to show for 90 minutes \u2013 hopefully \u2013 maybe 120, you never know.\u201d While Chelsea, the holders and league leaders, are the slight favourites, Hayes says games held after an international break are a lot more unpredictable. Reiten describes it as \u201calways hectic\u201d after an international camp but adds: \u201cWe\u2019re used to it \u2026 It\u2019s like this every single time we\u2019re done with camp, we always have like three days until the next game and this year we\u2019ve been behind Arsenal from the first game, so every game has been a big one for us and we\u2019ve had to win. \u201cWe love playing them. It\u2019s a lot of pressure. It\u2019s a big game and it\u2019s the game you love to win and hate to lose.\u201d The midfielder\u2019s international window was stunted after she tested positive for Covid on the day Norway played the first of their two World Cup qualifiers. \u201cI\u2019ve been saying that I must be immune for two years but apparently I wasn\u2019t,\u201d she says with a laugh. \u201cI was isolating for three days but I managed to be back for the second game. \u201cIt was hard, but it was just like having a cold. I managed to play, so I\u2019m happy with that.\u201d The pandemic took its toll on Reiten. Last season she struggled and Hayes named her among four players who found lockdown so hard it filtered on to the pitch when football restarted.   \u201cThat year was difficult on many levels,\u201d says the 27-year-old. \u201cI struggled with back injuries as well, but to be isolated, alone here, far away from my family and friends \u2013 and players were not allowed to see each other when we weren\u2019t training either \u2013 was a really tough time.  \u201cI appreciate everyone in my team because they are my teammates but they\u2019re also my friends and that year I felt like they were my family. We took care of each other and they were there for me. It was tough, but I\u2019m very glad I play in this team and with so many unbelievable human beings, because that\u2019s what they are.\u201d That time also made her appreciate football more. \u201cWhen you step on the pitch that\u2019s when you don\u2019t think about anything, so it was like time off from being isolated, time off from thinking about life. \u201cIt also made us closer as a group and we\u2019ve used that this season. We\u2019ve had a lot of injuries, players out with Covid and players coming on the pitch needing to step up, and everyone has been doing that and it\u2019s been great. \u201cWe\u2019ve got the results we wanted, and everyone feels like they are a big part of this team, which they are, but it\u2019s not always that easy if you\u2019re not playing much. It\u2019s easy to feel left out, but now we are such a good group.\u201d"

                    "body": "Chelsea will not need reminding of the role Liverpool\u2019s second-choice goalkeeper played in their downfall when the sides last met at Wembley. The form of Liverpool\u2019s first choice \u2013 or \u201cthe best goalie in the world\u201d, to use J\u00fcrgen Klopp\u2019s description \u2013 places a greater obstacle between Thomas Tuchel\u2019s team and payback in Saturday\u2019s FA Cup final. In a quadruple-chasing season featuring a club record 142 goals and counting, the dazzling impact of Luis D\u00edaz, the world-class consistency of Sadio Man\u00e9 and Mohamed Salah, and the contract doubts that surround them both, it is understandable the spotlight has settled only fleetingly on Alisson Becker. Yet as the away section at Villa Park recognised after Tuesday\u2019s vital win over Aston Villa by chanting the Brazilian\u2019s name long after the final whistle, his contribution to Liverpool\u2019s remarkable campaign cannot be overstated.  In many respects the 29-year-old shaped this campaign from the point of his 95th-minute winner at West Bromwich Albion last season that kept Klopp\u2019s injury-hit team on course for Champions League qualification. \u201cNow let\u2019s try to win it this season and then it will be even more special,\u201d said Alisson when reflecting on his centre-forward\u2019s header. Liverpool are one step from granting that particular wish. The perfectionist in Alisson will have been annoyed by his part in Douglas Luiz\u2019s opener for Villa and the error that gifted Ollie Watkins possession just outside the Liverpool penalty area. The unflappable professional in Alisson ensured neither affected his game, however, and two fine saves from Danny Ings helped secure the 2-1 victory that kept Liverpool on Manchester City\u2019s tails with two games remaining in the title race. Douglas Luiz\u2019s goal, and Son Heung-min\u2019s for Tottenham on Saturday, kept Alisson waiting for a 21st clean sheet of the Premier League season. He has the opportunity to equal or surpass the Liverpool Premier League record of 21 \u2013 set by Alisson in his debut season at the club in 2018-19 \u2013 against Southampton and Wolves next week. Only Ederson has kept as many clean sheets this term, although Alisson has faced more shots and made more saves than his international teammate and Premier League rival. The fine margins between Liverpool and City even extend to the battle for the Golden Gloves award. \u00c9douard Mendy, who Liverpool will face in the Cup final, trails the two Brazilians in third with 14 clean sheets. Alisson\u2019s save percentage of 73.7 is the second highest in the Premier League this season behind Jos\u00e9 S\u00e1, whose figure dipped to 74.5% after Wolves\u2019 mauling by City on Wednesday. The Liverpool keeper\u2019s ratio of saves inside the box has increased from 58.2% in 2019-20 to about 75% this season. His pass success rate is also up marginally, from 85.5% last season to 86.2%. The statistics reflect a goalkeeper in prime form but do not encapsulate Alisson\u2019s importance to Liverpool.  Ings is the latest opposition striker who can vouch for the former Roma player\u2019s formidable reputation in one-v-ones. That ability, enhanced by speed and awareness, gives Liverpool\u2019s manager and defenders the confidence to play the high line so fundamental to Klopp\u2019s approach, and to accept the risks that accompany it. Liverpool\u2019s trust in Alisson was also evident when he was consulted over the appointment of the Brazil World Cup-winner Cl\u00e1udio Taffarel to their goalkeeping coaching staff in November. The position is always evolving, Klopp explained, and the responsibility on Alisson increasing. \u201cWhen I was a player the most important skill [for a goalkeeper] was to save the ball but then it developed,\u201d the Liverpool manager said. \u201cYou could pass the ball back but that meant the goalkeeper had to use his feet and it was really tricky. It is obviously a position that is getting more and more influential and not only in the defensive moments but also the offensive moments.  \u201cYou see now a lot of goalkeepers are pretty long when they shoot the balls, which is good for some teams and we use that tactic from time to time as well. But it is more about being involved in the buildup situations; you can give the ball to the centre-halves without thinking: \u2018Oh my God, what is he doing?\u2019 You\u2019ve got to shoot [go long] with channelled balls, switch the balls from side, make the game big \u2013 all these kind of things.\u201d Chelsea could find no way past Caoimh\u00edn Kelleher during 120 minutes of February\u2019s enthralling Carabao Cup final. That was the third draw in three meetings between the clubs this season before Kelleher scored Liverpool\u2019s final penalty \u2013 and Mendy\u2019s 119th-minute replacement, Kepa Arrizabalaga, missed Chelsea\u2019s \u2013 as Klopp\u2019s team triumphed 11-10 in the shootout. The return of Alisson will strengthen Liverpool\u2019s belief for part two of their quadruple pursuit."

                    "body": "On a slope above the river Neckar in south-west Germany, about 25 miles (40km) from Stuttgart, stands the village of Neckarwestheim, its red terracotta roofs surrounded by vineyards and farmers\u2019 fields, with streets leading to a central market square. So far, so typical for a rural community in the German state of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg. However, this settlement of 4,200 residents has one defining characteristic: it is located right next to one of Germany\u2019s three remaining nuclear power stations. The challenges facing this picturesque village illustrate how the energy crisis is affecting Europe\u2019s largest economy, as Russia\u2019s weaponisation of the gas supply has complicated Germany\u2019s planned transition away from nuclear.  On a crisp, clear autumn day, clouds of steam rise from the Neckarwestheim nuclear plant\u2019s pressurised water reactor, pale against the hill at whose feet it stands. For those prepared to live with a reactor as a neighbour, its arrival in the mid-70s heralded a golden age. The site\u2019s first reactor stopped producing power in 2011, while the second has been operational since 1989. \u201cEveryone\u2019s dreams came true,\u201d says Jochen Winkler, the mayor of Neckarwestheim, from his office overlooking the main square of the village, which will celebrate its 900th birthday in 2023. In more recent times, the village has flourished; its population has doubled over the four decades the power station has been there.  Winkler reels off a list of the amenities enjoyed by residents, from a sports hall and a cultural centre to subsidised childcare and even, once upon a time, \u201cwelcome money\u201d paid to the parents of newborns, all thanks to local business taxes collected from the power station. Its owner is EnBW \u2013 a majority state-owned and publicly traded energy company, whose name stands for Energy Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg. \u201cWe had an income equivalent to that of communities which are three or four times our size,\u201d says Winkler. But this is coming to an end, and Neckarwestheim II is living on borrowed time, limiting the local authority\u2019s largesse. Along with Germany\u2019s two other remaining nuclear power stations, it was supposed to be turned off by the end of the year, undergoing the final stage of an 11-year phase-out process initiated by Angela Merkel\u2019s government after the 2011 Fukushima disaster in Japan.  However, the urgent need to ensure winter energy supply as Russia throttled flows of gas into Europe led the federal government in Berlin to grant a stay of execution. All three operating nuclear reactors \u2013 Neckarwestheim, Isar II in neighbouring Bavaria, and Emsland in the north-west close to the Dutch border \u2013 are now permitted to run until the middle of April next year. Neckarwestheim\u2019s contribution to Germany\u2019s electricity is not insignificant: it generated 11bn kWh of electricity in 2021. The reactor provides a sixth of the total electricity consumption in the industry-heavy state \u2013 home to significant manufacturing operations including several car plants \u2013 or two-thirds of the total electricity demand of the state\u2019s 5m households. \u201cPeople who are afraid of or have a problem with nuclear power don\u2019t live here. New citizens who have a problem with it don\u2019t move here,\u201d says Winkler. That statement certainly holds for Melita Marinkovic, out walking her puppy with her 12-year-old son, who has just moved here from Ludwigsburg, 15 miles south. \u201cIf there was a problem with the reactor, they would also be affected in Ludwigsburg,\u201d she says. Like many of her neighbours, she thinks it\u2019s a shame the power plant is being turned off: \u201cIt\u2019s a good source of clean energy.\u201d Residents\u2019 views contrast with prevailing public opinion in Germany, where the existing anti-nuclear movement gained prominence after the 1986 Chornobyl disaster, as fears grew about the risks of nuclear power. Despite Germany\u2019s temporary extension, opponents and environmental groups continue their demonstrations. Sporting an anti-nuclear badge on his jumper, Frank Wagner, from the mid-Neckar federation of citizens\u2019 action groups, fears the current nuclear extension is just the thin end of the wedge.  \u201cThis step shows us that the dam has been breached, which makes it quite easy to say in the coming months, \u2018Oh, we\u2019ve still got an energy shortage, we need the nuclear power plants for longer,\u2019\u201d Wagner says. He is also concerned that no location has yet been found for the permanent storage of Germany\u2019s nuclear waste; the discussions are expected to last nearly 30 years. Dr Andre Baumann, Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg\u2019s undersecretary of state for the environment, climate and energy, insists that the April extension will be the last. The Green politician, whose party returned last year to national government as part of a three-way coalition with the Social Democrats (SPD) and the Free Democrats (FDP), is adamant that no new fuel rods will be bought for Neckarwestheim, which would be necessary to keeping it running beyond April. For some, April is too late. After a previous year\u2019s safety check at the reactor revealed cracks in pressure generator heating pipes, two local people decided to take their complaint to court. Their case will be heard later this month.  The reactor\u2019s owner, EnBW, says the plant has a \u201cvery high level of safety, also in international comparisons\u201d. It adds that a previous court ruling found there was no reason to intervene in the operations of the reactor. The state government, with responsibility for nuclear oversight, says it is also satisfied that the plant can run safely. Apologising for the cool temperature in his office \u2013 the environment ministry has set its thermostats to 19C \u2013 Baumann says: \u201cWe mustn\u2019t forget what\u2019s important. We have to continue saving energy. \u201cWe have to adapt our energy system for the future. That means renewables, renewables, renewables. The setup costs are considerably lower than for new nuclear, coal or gas plants.\u201d But the Energiewende, or energy transition from fossil fuels to renewables, of which Germany was an early adopter, appears to have stalled in recent years. Many complain that plans to transport more wind power generated in the blustery north to the energy-hungry industrial south hit obstacles as far back as 2014. While the phase-out of nuclear and fossil fuels has been planned for years, the war has forced national energy policy to swerve in the other direction. Germany is racing to finish five terminals to receive liquid natural gas (LNG), and last week signed a 15-year deal with Qatar to receive new flows of LNG from 2026.  Coal also continues to play a role. A recent lack of wind has prompted Germany to burn more of it, accounting for 45% of all energy generation. This was up from 31% in the first half of 2022, according to official statistics, when almost half (49%) came from renewable sources. Some analysts are concerned that the final shutdown of nuclear, which accounted for 6% of total electricity generation in the first six months of the year, will also leave a gap. In Neckarwestheim, the authorities have developed two solar installations, but Winkler says the process of obtaining permits for new developments is lengthy and time-consuming. Dr Gottfried Kazenwadel\u2019s is the fourth generation in his family to farm crops and grow wine nearby. The chair of the local agricultural association is generally in favour of the nuclear switch-off, and like many Germans, would prefer the country to accelerate the development of renewable energy. He jokes that the village\u2019s name was often left off the packaging for local agricultural produce. \u201cNeckarwestheim was always in the news,\u201d he says, \u201cespecially when the second reactor was built, which wasn\u2019t necessarily good for marketing.\u201d"

Having a lovely rest of your evening.      10.02pm    Andy Hunter saw Liverpool\u2019s latest win.      9.58pm    A fine goal from Almiron was the difference but Everton never looked like scoring. Louise Taylor was in attendance.      9.56pm    Van Dijk: \u201cWe got a win, that is the most important thing. We play for one of the biggest clubs in the world and to have this goalkeeper with us in one of the things we need. It is all about the three points especially in this hectic period.\u201d     9.50pm    A fine 0-0 for Jacob Steinberg to enjoy.      9.48pm    Carrick to Middlesbrough.      9.47pm    Graham Potter: \u201cI think over the course of the game a point is about fair. A really tough game. Brentford make it really difficult to control things throughout the match. The boys gave everything and I am proud of them.\u201d     9.45pm    You wouldn\u2019t pay to watch Spurs. So little ambition.      9.43pm   GOAL! Manchester United 2-0 Tottenham (Fernandes, 69)  A calm finish into the corner.      9.40pm    The lad himself, Ben Fisher, was there to see Che Adams lead Southampton to victory at Bournemouth.      9.35pm    Everton failed to muster a shot on target at Newcastle. Admittedly, they only had one off target.      9.27pm    Go and join Barry Glendenning for Man United v Spurs.       9.25pm   Full-time: Newcastle 1-0 Everton  Almiron\u2019s goal was a worthy winner on a night of 1-0s.      9.24pm   Full-time: Brentford 0-0 Chelsea  A pretty entertaining goalless draw.      9.23pm   Full-time: Liverpool 1-0 West Ham  Klopp has Nunez and Alisson to thank for another 1-0 win at Anfield.      9.22pm   Full-time: Bournemouth 0-1 Southampton  Saints hold on for a crucial win and end Gary O\u2019Neil\u2019s unbeaten start thanks to Adams\u2019 first-half header.      9.20pm   GOAL! Manchester United 1-0 Tottenham (Fred, 47)  Fred with a deflected strike from the edge of the box.     9.18pm    Bournemouth 0-1 Southampton: Tavernier swings in a corner from the left which Bazunu drops but Cook cannot direct the ball on target.      9.17pm    Brentford 0-0 Chelsea: Aubameyang cuts in from the left and aims for the near post from 20 yards bu Raya reads it and gets down to hold on.     9.16pm    Liverpool 1-0 West Ham: Benrahma does fine work on the left to dig out a cross, Bowen controls it and pulls the ball back to Soucek who jabs at goal only to see Milner prevent it from going in.     9.14pm    Brentford 0-0 Chelsea: Sterling goes into the box but the ball gets stuck under his feet, allowing Pinnock to get in possession and block his shot.     9.13pm    Liverpool 1-0 West Ham: Salah goes through one-on-one with Fabianski but the goalkeeper comes out quickly and repels the Egyptian\u2019s shot.     9.11pm    Brentford 0-0 Chelsea: Mee sends in a cross from the left wing. is he a left winger now? This really is total football.     9.09pm    Liverpool 1-0 West Ham: The Hammers break and the ball reaches Scamacca in the box but he flashes his shot wide. Colum Fordham emails: \u201cKlopp\u2019s faith in Nunez, despite his behavioural misdemeanours and profligate lack of passing against Manchester City, seems to be justified by his display this evening which has been full of dynamism, with excellent shots and a beautifully headed goal.\u201d     9.08pm    Liverpool 1-0 West Ham: Henderson gets down the right and sends in a low cross forcing Zouma to intervene. The defender sticks out a foot to send the ball towards his own goal but it bounces off the top of the bar.      9.05pm    Meanwhile in Germany \u2026      9.05pm    Brentford 0-0 Chelsea: Henry breaks into the box and takes aim but his shot from a tight angle is deflected wide by Azpilicueta. The officials miss the touch and give a goal-kick.   Updated at 9.15pm BST    9.03pm    Liverpool 1-0 West Ham: A bit of a scramble inside the Hammers box after a corner but Jones takes a swipe and the ball goes over.      9.02pm    Bournemouth 0-1 Southampton: A cross from the right hits a Southampton defender on the arm inside the box. VAR takes a look but they have no interest.     8.59pm    Liverpool 1-0 West Ham: A looping cross finds Benrahma at the back post but he fails to get any power on his volley, allowing Alisson to grab hold.      8.58pm    Brentford 0-0 Chelsea: \u201cTo all my fellow Yanks hoping for Pulisic to get more time,\u201d emails Mary Waltz. \u201cI feel the same way. But this is the third manager to restrict his playing time. All three want to win and there is no conspiracy against him. We don\u2019t know what goes on in training.\u201d      8.57pm    Brentford 0-0 Chelsea: Mee lunges in on Kovacic and gets nowhere near the ball but the referee waves play on. To add to the amusement, Raya then does a 360 turn in his own box.     8.55pm    Liverpool 1-0 West Ham: Antonio is readying himself to come on \u2026     8.53pm    Liverpool 1-0 West Ham: Alisson comes out and flaps at a cross from the left, forcing Tsimikas to clean things up at the back post and turn the ball behind for a corner.      8.52pm    Liverpool 1-0 West Ham: Firmino runs onto a pass but his shot is deflected just wide.      8.51pm    Brentford 0-0 Chelsea: A triple change for Chelsea with Pulisic, Sterling and Chukwuemeka for Cucurella, Havertz and Broja.      8.50pm    Liverpool 1-0 West Ham: Moyes takes off Fornals and sends on Benrahma. They have looked pretty blunt in the final third so need to change things up.      8.49pm    Brentford 0-0 Chelsea: Onyeka off, Baptiste on.     8.46pm    Liverpool 1-0 West Ham: Nunez, Carvalho and Nunez off, Fabinho, Jones and Elliott on.      8.45pm    Newcastle 1-0 Everton: Almiron receives a pass in a similar position to the one he scored from earlier, he takes a touch and takes aim but his shot drifts just over the bar.     8.41pm    Brentford 0-0 Chelsea: An inch-perfect cross finds an unmarked Mbuemo on the edge of the six-yard box but he heads the ball straight at Arrizabalaga. He really should score from there.     8.40pm    Liverpool 1-0 West Ham: Alexander-Arnold gets to the byline but he pulls the ball back to a vacant spot in the area.      8.36pm    Liverpool 1-0 West Ham: Henderson plays the ball into Salah and gets it straight back but he lifts his shot over the bar from the edge of the box.      8.35pm    Newcastle 1-0 Everton: Willock is on for Joelinton.      8.33pm   Second half  Here we go again!      8.27pm    More pedantry, this time from Ian Sargeant: \u201cJust to be the counter pedant to Peter Oh the flash is far too far down the shirt to catch stray sauces. \u201cThe all black second kit is probably the best defence. Think we\u2019ve only worn it the once. First game if the season on 700 degree heat. Ideal for black.\u201d     8.26pm    If you want non-stop action and goalmouth scrambles, then the live politics blog could be for you tonight.      8.20pm    \u201cAt the risk of sounding pedantic, that is West Ham\u2019s Third shirt, not Away,\u201d offers king of the pedants, Peter Oh. \u201cI\u2019m not a fan of its \u2018vibrant flash\u2019 and \u2018graphic spark\u2019 but it does have one thing going for it. You don\u2019t have to worry about dripping ketchup and mustard stains onto your beery belly as you sloppily chomp on a hot dog while crammed into a hard stadium seat.\u201d  Updated at 8.31pm BST    8.19pm   Half time scores  Brentford 0-0 ChelseaLiverpool 1-0 West HamNewcastle 1-0 EvertonBournemouth 0-1 Southampton     8.16pm   PENALTY SAVED!

I think that is a penalty \u2026 VAR is taking a look. McCoist agrees with me. This is taking a while. The referee is going for a look \u2026     8.11pm    Liverpool 1-0 West Ham: Nunez chests the ball down on the edge of the box and whacks a shot with his left foot which whacks back off the post. He looks to be finding his feet.      8.09pm    Liverpool 1-0 West Ham: A speedy attack sees Firmino lay the ball into Salah\u2019s path for a first-time shot from 18 yards but it goes straight at Fabianski.      8.08pm    Brentford 0-0 Chelsea: A Bees free-kick is lumped into the box, Mee challenges Loftus-Cheek who flicks it backwards allowing Toney is nod towards goal but Arrizabalaga reads it and makes a fine save. The goalkeeper is in good form at the moment.   Updated at 8.13pm BST    8.07pm    Bournemouth 0-1 Southampton: Tavernier is tripped on the edge of the box and a free-kick is awarded.

Newcastle 1-0 Everton (Almiron, 31)  WHAT A STRIKE!

There is nothing in the clash and the Everton midfielder needs to get up and grow up.     7.53pm   GOAL! Liverpool 1-0 West Ham (Nunez, 22)  It is a fine header from the Uruguayan to open the scoring. Tsimikas finds space on the left and sends in a great cross for Nunez to attack and direct down into the corner across Fabianski.      Updated at 10.24pm BST    7.50pm    Brentford 0-0 Chelsea: Tim Sherwood thinks Loftus-Cheek should be starting for England.

Updated at 7.48pm BST    7.39pm    Liverpool 0-0 West Ham: Another dreadful clearance from Alisson but once against the Hammers fail to make the most of it. Not sure what the Brazilian is doing tonight his distribution has been awful. Gareth Southgate is at Anfield tonight \u2026     7.36pm    Liverpool 0-0 West Ham: Firmino collects the ball 20 yards from goal, turns and takes aim but his shot flashes wide without concerning the goalkeeper.      7.35pm    Newcastle 0-0 Everton: The ball is played back to former Sunderland goalkeeper Jordan Pickford who is roundly booed. Classic.      7.34pm    Brentford 0-0 Chelsea: The Bees break down the left and the ball is swung into the box where Toney is waiting, he takes a touch but Arrizabalaga is out quickly to force the striker wide and the danger subsides.   Updated at 7.42pm BST    7.32pm    Liverpool 0-0 West Ham: Alisson pings a clearance straight to Rice who is just outside the area but he plays a loose pass and Liverpool get away with it.     7.30pm   Kick-off  Whistles are peeping across the country.     7.22pm    A bit of Squires \u2026      7.11pm    \u201cSurely Potter is just helping out England\u2019s HRWC chances,\u201d suggests Joe Pearson. \u201cKeep Pulisic on the bench so he gets sufficiently rusty so as to be effectively useless in Qatar.\u201d Cunning like a fox.     7.08pm    Neal Butler says: \u201cThe problem with Pulisic, as I see it, is that he is a streaky player, and kind of a one-trick-pony. And, despite him being a big deal here in the States, Potter is under no obligation to play Pulisic into form so the USMNT can benefit from that at the HRWC.\u201d      7.02pm    \u201cWhy won\u2019t Graham Potter let Christian Pulsic start?\u201d asks Kurt Perleberg. \u201cHe\u2019s the USMNT most important player. He has a memoir out right now (My Journey So Far) and he is in a Volkswagen commercial here in the States. But as we saw a few weeks ago when he comes out of the bench.he could touch the ball a few times &amp; score a goal!\u201d I guess he just prefers others at the moment. He seems to be getting most decisions right.     6.58pm    Elsewhere tonight \u2026      6.55pm    \u201cChilwell isn\u2019t even on the bench. Is he injured again?\u201d asks Julian Menz. Not that I know of \u2026     6.54pm    Hopefully tonight\u2019s games are better than Brighton v Forest. Poor Jesse.      6.51pm    There is now more discipline at Everton \u2026      6.46pm    Some good news for Everton as Dominic Calvert-Lewin starts. They have struggled up top this season as their \u2018for\u2019 column confirms.

Liverpool will be looking to follow up their victory over Manchester City when West Ham visit. Jurgen Klopp\u2019s side looked more aggressive and confident at Anfield on Sunday so a replication of such a performance will ensure it is a tricky night for David Moyes\u2019 side. The Hammers, however, will not be fearful thanks to a five-game unbeaten run and if they can carry on such a sequence they will be ecstatic. Elsewhere, Newcastle are hosting Everton. Eddie Howe\u2019s side sit sixth at the start of the night and could move up a place if Spurs get something at Manchester United in the 8.15pm kick-off. The Magpies and their expensively assembled squad are looking like a side who can challenge for European spots, having not lost since August. Everton are slowly improving under Frank Lampard thanks to a more stable defence and midfield but they really need to find some zip in the final third if they are to get back to being a top-half team because they are struggling for goals. Brentford and Chelsea are doing battle in a west London derby. The Bees showed what they could do against Brighton on Friday and Graham Potter can do no wrong at Chelsea, making it an intriguing 90 minutes ahead. If all that is not too much for you, then we can indulge ourselves with Bournemouth v Southampton. One side is looking composed under a caretaker manager, while the other could soon need one. Gary O\u2019Neil is unbeaten since replacing Scott Parker on a temporary basis and Southampton, arriving in the relegation zone, are tipped to send Ralph Hassenhuttl packing if results do not take a dramatic upwards turn. Here\u2019s to a fun night!  Updated at 8.10pm BST "

                    "body": "From Oman in the east to Morocco in the west, Middle East and north African royalty have been closely monitoring plans for the Queen\u2019s funeral, but with days to go until the biggest event in modern royal history, they are unlikely to travel to London in numbers. Monarchies have sought to divine meaning from protocol arrangements, and are largely underwhelmed by what they have seen. An expectation that the kings and presidents of the region would board a bus to travel to Westminster Abbey has not been received well. Nor have mooted seating plans that place regional royals and presidents on pews well behind Commonwealth leaders who were an important part of the Queen\u2019s orbit, but are often less influential when it comes to Britain\u2019s trade and security ties. Leaders of Kuwait, the UAE and Saudi Arabia have been uncertain who to send to London to what would be one of the biggest gatherings of global leaders in decades. Kuwait is thought to be sending its crown prince, and Abu Dhabi a vice-president. Saudi Arabia\u2019s de facto leader, Mohammed bin Salman, is thought to still be planning to travel \u2013 for what would be his first trip to the UK since the death of the dissident Jamal Khashoggi \u2013 however, a final decision has not been made, 72 hours from dignitaries gathering. If Prince Mohammed does fly to London, he is not expected to take part in formal ceremonies and is instead likely to offer private condolences to a King who was better known in Saudi Arabia than the late Queen herself. There are high hopes that Charles will help reboot ties between London and Riyadh, which have been strained in the turbulent years that Prince Mohammed has wielded power. As Prince of Wales, Charles travelled to Saudi Arabia 12 times, and he is viewed in the kingdom as coming from a longstanding sympathetic position to cultures, traditions and the history of the region. Charles has also taken a strong interest in Islam, and is believed to have had basic Arabic lessons. \u201cCharles has built up really strong relationships with royal families in the Gulf over decades and has done so on the basis of friendship and shared royal blood, which matters particularly to the Saudis,\u201d said a former British diplomat who was based in Riyadh. \u201cI think that gives him the basis for frank conversations. And for a long time, he has had the ability to raise issues and even be critical in a way that shorter-term political leaders find quite hard. \u201cHe used to go and spend time with the late King Abdullah in the desert in a tent. I remember a friend telling me that they played bowls together in the sand. You take the time to go and stay overnight and deal with them in places that they live, then that matters. \u201cThe extent to which he\u2019ll be able to continue to do that now that he\u2019s king is an open question. Because he\u2019ll be much more conservative about how he chooses to wield his influence. But the fact is, to the extent that he chooses to help the British government, he will be a very positive influence with those countries. \u201cHe\u2019s obviously had the issue with the cash [donation] that came up a few months ago, but nevertheless there\u2019s some positives to be found.\u201d The now King Charles had also built strong ties in the UAE and Qatar, and those with the latter attracted controversy in July, when revelations emerged of \u00a32.5m in cash donations made by the former Qatari prime minister Hamad bin Jassim to the Prince of Wales\u2019s charitable foundation. In Abu Dhabi, expectations are high of deeper ties with the new King. During Queen Elizabeth\u2019s reign came the establishment of the UAE as a country in 1971 and its extraordinary growth in the five decades since. The Queen visited Dubai and Abu Dhabi on state occasions seen as helping British trade ties. \u201cBut when it came to Charles,\u201d said a British official with longstanding ties to the Gulf, \u201che was able to sit down and talk the talk with them. He was prepared to advance British interests, and so was Prince Andrew, to be fair.  \u201cHe won\u2019t be able to do that as King, but they know that he understands them. He hasn\u2019t been banging on about the tyranny of autocracy for years. He isn\u2019t a preacher like some British officials have been.\u201d How King Charles will recalibrate his friendships and perhaps his views about the Gulf states will be keenly watched in all Gulf capitals, where expectations are strong that Britain\u2019s new monarch will offer a familiar and less formal approach, based on decades of links and an immersive interest in the region and Islam. \u201cThere is a lot hanging on this, in the eyes of the GCC,\u201d said a Kuwaiti official. \u201cEveryone is reading the tea leaves. However, it\u2019s not off to a good start. If the King came to our neighbourhood, we would not put him on a bus. Expecting firm friends of King Charles to all gather like schoolboys on a bus to go to the funeral is not the start we were expecting. That\u2019s why some of us are staying away.\u201d"

Stamkos put the Lightning ahead for good in the third period just 21 seconds after New York\u2019s Frank Vatrano scored on the power play with the Lightning captain in the penalty box for holding. Nikita Kucherov and Ondrej Palat assisted on the winner with six and a half minutes left, with the puck deflecting off Stamkos\u2019 knee into the net after Rangers goalie Igor Shesterkin stopped the initial shot. Stamkos also scored on a wrist shot from the top of the right circle midway through the second period. Andrei Vasilevskiy finished with 20 saves for the Lightning, who won the series 4-2 \u2013 rattling off four straight victories after losing the first two games on the road \u2013 to advance to the Stanley Cup final against the Colorado Avalanche. Game 1 is Wednesday night in Denver. The Lightning are the first team to make three consecutive appearances in the Cup Final since Edmonton did it from 1983-85. They are trying to become the first to win three straight championships since the New York Islanders claimed four in a row from 1980-83. The Rangers, down 3-2 in a series for the third straight round, were 5-0 in elimination games this postseason before Saturday night.  The only teams to win six or more elimination games in a single postseason were the 1975 New York Islanders (eight), 2014 Los Angeles Kings (seven) and 2003 Minnesota Wild (six). The Rangers dropped three of the first four games before winning three straight elimination games to beat the Pittsburgh Penguins in the opening round. They lost the first two on the road at Carolina before rebounding to oust the Hurricanes in seven games to reach the East final. It was a totally different story Saturday night, with the Lightning limiting New York\u2019s scoring opportunities while outshooting the Rangers 31-21. Vasilevskiy went long stretches without being tested. He faced just seven shots in the opening period, six in the second and eight in the third. Shesterkin, meanwhile, stopped 29 of 31 shots and made big save after big save to give New York a chance."

                    "body": "The former Brazilian president Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva has confirmed he will kickstart his campaign to reclaim the presidency from his right-wing adversary Jair Bolsonaro next month, comparing their rivalry to a clash of the titans between Liverpool and Manchester City. Lula\u2019s desire to secure a third term as the leader of Latin America\u2019s largest democracy has been an open secret since he recovered his political rights last year when a series of corruption convictions against him were quashed. But on Tuesday night the veteran leftist finally confirmed he would activate his political comeback on 7 May. He likened the coming battle with Bolsonaro to last weekend\u2019s FA Cup match between Liverpool and Manchester City \u2013 in which the red team defeated the blue team 3-2. After launching his candidacy Lula said he would begin touring the South American country, which appears to be emerging from one of the world\u2019s most severe Covid outbreaks. \u201cBrazil needs fixing,\u201d Lula, a two-term president from 2003 to 2011, tweeted after his announcement. With just under six months until the 2 October election, polls put Lula ahead of Bolsonaro, a Trump-style populist who critics blame for soaring Amazon deforestation, undermining democracy, and a disastrous response to a coronavirus epidemic that has killed more than 660,000 people. \u201cLula\u2019s the favourite, there\u2019s no doubt about it \u2026 because in any poll you look at 60% of voters say they reject Bolsonaro,\u201d said Thomas Traumann, a Rio-based political observer. \u201cThis is a government that, objectively, is a failure. It didn\u2019t bring economic growth, it didn\u2019t improve people\u2019s lives, it had 660,000 deaths during the pandemic,\u201d Traumann added. Yet despite those failures, Bolsonaro has risen in the polls in recent weeks \u2013 partly thanks to billions of pounds of welfare payments being doled out to the poor \u2013 suggesting the race may be far closer than many progressives had hoped.  \u201cIt won\u2019t be easy. This isn\u2019t a war that\u2019s won. It\u2019s a war that we can win,\u201d Lula, 76, who has towered over Brazilian politics since first running for president in 1989, warned during a recent visit to Rio. Hoping to attract centrist voters, Lula has chosen his one-time presidential rival Geraldo Alckmin, a centre-right former governor of S\u00e3o Paulo, as his vice-presidential running mate. \u201cWe\u2019re going to join forces to rebuild our country,\u201d Alckmin said after their once improbable partnership was unveiled. Traumann called the alliance an important gesture but believed Lula needed to do more to attract voters from outside the left. That would mean engaging with politicians who helped remove the Workers\u2019 party (PT) from power with the highly controversial 2016 impeachment of Lula\u2019s successor Dilma Rousseff. \u201cThe PT won\u2019t beat Bolsonaro on its own,\u201d Traumann said."

I\u2019ll leave with you our roundup of this weekend\u2019s top-flight team news. Bye for now.\n\n\nUpdated at 5.42pm BST\n\n\n 5.29pm  \n\nOn Monday the England centre-back Lotte Wubben-Moy ducked down the aisle of the team bus as it wove its way from the Euro 2022 victory celebrations in Trafalgar Square. The 23-year-old was on a mission.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know whether it was the energy of being in London, being around people out in front of the National Portrait Gallery that were screaming our names as we were dancing in front of them, but it was a catalyst for me to then go say it to everyone and go to Leah [Williamson, the captain] and Sue [Campbell, the director of women\u2019s football at the Football Association] to say: \u2018We need to do something now.\u2019\u201d\nThe result was a letter, signed by all 23 players in the squad that had won the team\u2019s first major trophy. It was addressed to Tory leadership hopefuls Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak, urging whichever becomes prime minister to ensure every girl in school has access to football in PE.\n\n\n\n\n 5.28pm  \n\nThe Aston Villa boss Steven Gerrard is confident his side can eradicate the inconsistencies of last season and finish in the top half of the Premier League. \nAfter an initial upturn in results following Gerrard\u2019s autumn appointment, Villa slumped in the second half of last term and finished 14th. Villa have signed Philippe Coutinho on a permanent basis and added Boubacar Kamara, Diego Carlos and Ludwig Augustinsson to their squad and Gerrard is looking upwards. \n\u201cWe\u2019re very much looking forward and trying to improve our league position and finish in the top half, we want to have positive cup runs as well,\u201d Gerrard said in his pre-match press conference ahead of the opener at Bournemouth. \u201cWe want to try and make our fans happy. We\u2019ve had a smooth pre-season, the application has been superb but now it\u2019s for real. I\u2019m confident that we can improve on our inconsistencies last season, that\u2019s the most important thing for me.\u201d (PA Media)\n\n\nUpdated at 5.50pm BST\n\n\n 5.22pm  \n\n\u201cDo your research.\u201d\nA rather spiky Erik ten Hag told assembled journalists earlier that it wasn\u2019t only Cristiano Ronaldo who left Manchester United\u2019s now-infamous friendly against Rayo Vallecano before full-time last Sunday. Watch the video:\n\n\n\n\n 5.18pm  \n\nSquad sheets for all this weekend\u2019s Premier League games are here:\n\n\n\n\n 5.17pm  \n\nWest Ham United\u2019s new striker Gianluca Scamacca will miss their Premier League opener against champions Manchester City as he is short of match fitness following his move from Italian Serie A side Sassuolo, manager David Moyes said today. The Italy international joined the London side last month on a five-year contract but Moyes said Sunday\u2019s match comes too soon for the 23-year-old. \n\u201cScamacca has only just really joined us, so he\u2019s probably a little bit behind, so I\u2019m not expecting him to be available this weekend,\u201d Moyes said. \u201cHe\u2019s not had the chance to play ... so it probably makes it very difficult for us to put him out on the pitch so soon. His training is a little bit behind compared to the others. He has trained, but maybe not as regular and as consistent.\n\u201cThe transfer took quite a bit off as they pulled him out of some games and training at the time, so we\u2019ve got him in and I like what I see, but we\u2019re trying to get him in the best condition we can and get him ready to play.\u201d \nMoyes, whose side finished seventh last season, will also be without another Italian, Angelo Ogbonna, for up to four weeks while the defender builds up his fitness following a knee injury. (Reuters)\n\n\nUpdated at 5.17pm BST\n\n\n 5.09pm  \n\nNews from the Scottish Premiership: Alfredo Morelos returns to the Rangers squad for the cinch Premiership game against Kilmarnock at Ibrox on Saturday. \nThe Colombia forward has recovered from a thigh injury which has kept him out since March and which required surgery. Defender Filip Helander remains out with a foot problem, and midfielder Ianis Hagi has been sidelined since January after suffering cruciate ligament damage. (PA Media)\n\n\n\n 5.06pm  \n\n\u201c75 days is a long wait,\u201d says the official Premier League India Twitter account.\nIs it? \n\n\n\n\n 5.03pm  \n\nIt\u2019s Friday, it\u2019s 5pm \u2013 yes! \u2013 it\u2019s Rob Smyth with today\u2019s Fiver:\n\n\n\n\n 5.02pm  \n\n\u201cRalph Hassenh\u00fcttl is right, plenty of time left to make transfers happen,\u201d emails Olivier. \u201cThis is actually a shame, I\u2019d love to see the transfer window slam shut with the first kick-off. Much more fun and fair than this nonsense.\u201d\nThis is an idea I can get behind. Spice it up a bit.\n\n\n\n 4.52pm  \n\nEvery time I switch on Sky Sports News, it\u2019s just Brendan Rodgers saying \u201cat this moment in time.\u201d\nThe Premier League is most definitely back.\n\n\n\n 4.51pm  \n\nChampionship news: Apparently, the pitch at the Coventry Building Society Arena is in a right old state after the venue hosted the rugby sevens at the Commonwealth Games.\nAs a result, Coventry\u2019s meeting with Rotherham, currently scheduled for 3pm on Sunday, has been thrown into doubt, and the home club have confirmed that a pitch inspection will take place tomorrow:\n\n\n\n\n 4.44pm  \n\nThe Southampton manager, Ralph Hasenh\u00fcttl, has insisted big-money signings \u201cmake no sense\u201d for Southampton. \nSaints have brought in six recruits before the new campaign, with further additions still being sought. Hasenh\u00fcttl believes spending upwards of \u00a340million on one player remains off Southampton\u2019s agenda, however, with the south-coast club continuing to focus on young targets. \n\u201cI\u2019m still of the opinion that \u00a340 or \u00a350million transfers make no sense for us,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we of course want quality, and if it\u2019s young, OK, no problem, take it. This is the way we want to go and it\u2019s good that we have done our job so far. But the transfer window is open so long that, if we do something we have enough time to do it.\u201d\n\nUpdated at 4.47pm BST\n\n\n 4.40pm  \n\nHang on, I\u2019ve finally thought of a more ludicrous transfer fee: Andy Carroll, for \u00a335million, in 2011.\n\n\n\n 4.39pm  \n\nCucurella latest!\n\u201cYes, it would have been nice to pay a bit less,\u201d emails Nate. \u201cBut for a barely-24-year-old Spanish international who was player of the season for a top-half club last year, and who can play in multiple positions ... it seems understandable to plunk down the extra five or 10 million. In a market where Richarlison and Raphina are each worth \u00a350m, Chelsea simply paid the going price for a quality young player.\u201d\n\n\n\n 4.35pm  \n\nVia Nottingham Forest\u2019s YouTube \u2013 Jack Colback has had a chat before their opener against Newcastle at 3pm tomorrow:\n\u201cI think we\u2019ve made the fans proud here. It\u2019s about backing that up. We\u2019re not here just to have a \u2018swansong\u2019 season in the Premier League,\u201d Colback said. \u201cIt\u2019s about trying to compete, and it\u2019s what we\u2019ll be trying to do.\u201d\nOn Forest\u2019s transfer activity: \u201cEspecially for us, the club, and the fans, it must be good for them to see the owners backing the team and backing the manager.\u201d\nOn Jesse Lingard: \u201cJesse\u2019s a good lad. For us, he\u2019s just another player ... for the fans, he\u2019s the type of player they might never have expected to come here. He brings a huge amount of of experience in terms of the Premier League ... that\u2019s going to help us, it\u2019s going to help with lads who haven\u2019t experienced his level.\u201d\n\n\nUpdated at 4.36pm BST\n\n\n 4.15pm  \n\nBarcelona\u2019s new striker Robert Lewandowski says he feels fitter now at 33 than he did nearly five years ago and that he hopes to help the team with his technical skills and experience. The Poland striker, who scored 344 goals for Bayern in 375 matches, joined Bar\u00e7a in a deal worth \u20ac45million euros last month and was presented to thousands of fans at Camp Nou on Friday. Lewandowski, who will turn 34 this month, says age does not matter.\n\u201cIt is only a number and physically I don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m 33, nearly 34, because I know I can still play a few years at top level or even longer,\u201d Lewandowski said. \u201cI feel better even than when I was a 29-year-old. It\u2019s not the question we have to think about.\u201d \nLewandowski and Bayern bosses criticised each other over the way they handled the transfer, with the player saying there had been lot of \u201cpolitics\u201d from the side of the club who were \u201ctrying to find an argument\u201d to sell him. \n\u201cIf we\u2019re talking about that period, for sure, it wasn\u2019t easy for me to decide to leave Bayern after eight years, but I know for me and my family it was the perfect next step in my life and my career,\u201d he said. The Bundesliga\u2019s second highest all-time scorer behind the late Gerd M\u00fcller said he would use his experience to guide Barca\u2019s young players. \u201cThis mix of young players and experienced players is important,\u201d Lewandowski said. \u201cIf I can help them with some words, not only technical skills on the pitch, but sometimes more with words I can tell them and explain because I\u2019ve seen a lot in my life in football.\u201d (Reuters)\n\n\nUpdated at 4.23pm BST\n\n\n 4.09pm  \n\nOver on Twitter, Fabrizio Romano has more news about Mertens and his departure from Napoli. Is he off to Turkey?\n\nAnd in the final Mertens update of the afternoon, this from Patrick Kendrick on Twitter:\n\n\n\n\n 4.06pm  \n\nThe Cucurella debate rolls on:\n\u201cCucurella is a terrific player, but I do wonder where he\u2019ll play with Chilwell clearly the place holder at left-back,\u201d comments montesdeoca. \u201cPerhaps Tuchel sees him as doubling up as a marauding centre-back ... I\u2019m also slightly surprised at our alleged courtship of De Jong. Another midfielder? Perhaps Jorginho will indeed be sold. In general I\u2019m baffled by the lack of departures \u2013 the squad is taking on a rather bloated look.\u201d\nMeanwhile, Bob Soule tweets:\n\nAnd Jeff Sachs keeps it short and sweet on email, regarding Cucurella: \u201cThis is going to be a big flop.\u201d\n\n\n\n 3.58pm  \n\nDid you miss anything? You can find our individual previews for every Premier League club on this page.\nAnd below, a handful of pieces all looking ahead to the big kick-off:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 3.49pm  \n\nYou may have seen this already, but here goes anyway. Dries Mertens posted an emotional and brilliant farewell message to Napoli fans on Wednesday night. Both a classy goodbye to the club and a good piece of editing by his social media guru:\n\n\n\n\n 3.41pm  \n\nIf you\u2019d like to get involved with this afternoon\u2019s Premier League countdown fun/heated debate, you can always email me, or alternatively contact me via the magic of Twitter.\n\n\n\n 3.38pm  \n\n\u201cIs up to \u00a362m for Cucurella (who cannot realistically be described as being in the top five full backs in the league, at least at this point) maybe the maddest transfer in PL history?\u201d comments oceanicwave.\n\u201cI am honestly struggling to think of a more obviously overpriced deal. I was thinking maybe Pepe at \u00a370m but at least he\u2019d come off an exceptional season and looked exciting.\n\u201cIf a state-owned club with about 12 \u00a360m players in it already pull out of a deal because the price has ballooned out of all control, maybe it\u2019s time to look at whether you\u2019re doing the right thing.\u201d\n\n\n\n 3.34pm  \n\nI\u2019m not entirely sure if Richarlison\u2019s sale to Tottenham can be seen as part of Lampard\u2019s \u201cstriker headache\u201d? It\u2019s going to be a very long headache, if so.\n\n\n\n 3.32pm  \n\nFrank Lampard believes Dele Alli could be the remedy for his striker headache in Everton\u2019s Premier League opener against Chelsea. Lampard heads into Saturday\u2019s evening fixture at Goodison Park without a recognised central forward after Dominic Calvert-Lewin was ruled out for six weeks with a knee injury. \nSalomon Rondon is suspended for the visit of Lampard\u2019s former club, while Richarlison has been sold to Tottenham. Alli has started only once since his January switch from Spurs, but Lampard said: \u201cDele made his name as a second striker, in my opinion, with Harry Kane at Tottenham. \n\u201cThey had some great years together. He may be moved back as the years went on, generally to become more of a No 8 or a more structured midfield player. But he is certainly in the running as a solution.\u201d (PA Media)\n\n\nUpdated at 3.32pm BST\n\n\n 3.25pm  \n\nI know what you\u2019re sitting there and thinking ... when do the top leagues start across Europe? Great question!\nSerie A kicks off next Saturday, Sampdoria v Atalanta being the curtain-raiser, at 6.30pm local time.\nThe Bundesliga, like the Premier League, kicks into gear this evening, with Eintracht Frankfurt hosting the Robert Lewandowski-less Bayern Munich at 8.30pm tonight (7.30pm UK).\nLa Liga begins next Friday night with Osasuna v Sevilla at 8pm UK time/9pm in Spain.\nIn France, Lyon kick things off at 8pm UK time tonight in Ligue 1, at home to one of the promoted teams, Ajaccio, who will be popping across from their base on the island of Corsica. Presumably they won\u2019t get the ferry, but here\u2019s a photo of one leaving Ajaccio anyway. \n\n\nUpdated at 5.12pm BST\n\n\n 3.15pm  \n\nThanks Tom. Hello everyone. Right, what\u2019s the latest? Let me check.\n\n\n\n 3.09pm  \n\nAnd with that, it\u2019s Luke\u2019s turn to retake the reins to guide you through the rest of the afternoon. Bye and have a good weekend.\n\n\n\n 3.05pm  \n\nAn early-season headache for Leicester: Ricardo Pereira has been ruled out for six months with a ruptured achilles.\n\n\n\n 3.01pm  \n\nBrentford\u2019s Bryan Mbeumo could switch his international allegiance from France to Cameroon in time to play for the west African nation in the World Cup, Associated Press is reporting. Cameroon\u2019s football federation said on Friday that the winger wants to change eligibility to put himself in contention for a place at Qatar 2022 . He would be the third former France under-21 international with family ties to Cameroon to make the switch this year, after Georges-Kevin Nkoudou and Olivier Ntcham.\n\nUpdated at 3.06pm BST\n\n\n 2.45pm  \n\nAnd here\u2019s Jamie Jackson\u2019s full story on Eric ten Hag\u2019s laying down of the law at Old Trafford:\n\n\n\n\n 2.37pm  \n\nWolves have rejected Nottingham Forest\u2019s offer for Morgan Gibbs-White, as Ben Fisher and Will Unwin report:\n\n\n\n\n 2.35pm  \n\nWhen did \u201cin the building\u201d become the go-to cliche to describe getting transfer deals done? Whatever, Maxwel Cornet is apparently in one as his \u00a317.5m West Ham move from Burnley edges closer to completion. Here\u2019s Moyesy: \u201cHe\u2019s in the building now, so hopefully we can get that one done.\u201d\n\n\n\n 2.29pm  \n\nOf course, for most professional clubs in England this isn\u2019t the opening weekend of the season \u2013 the EFL season got under way last season, and there\u2019s Championship action tonight when Birmingham, bogged down by ownership uncertainty for months and tipped by many for relegation, take on promotion hopefuls Huddersfield at St Andrew\u2019s. Blues got a decent draw at Luton last week mind, while Huddersfield were beaten by Burnley and it may take new manager Danny Schofield time to bed in.\n\n\n\n 2.18pm  \nEddie Howe signs new long-term Newcastle deal\n\nNewcastle\u2019s manager has underlined his commitment to what we might euphemistically call the Project by signing a new long-term contract at St James\u2019 Park\nA club statement said: \u201cNewcastle United are delighted to confirm that head coach Eddie Howe has signed a new long-term contract at St. James\u2019 Park.\u201cHowe joined the Magpies in November 2021, shortly after a takeover of the club by an investment group comprising PIF, PCP Capital Partners and RB Sports &amp; Media.\n\u201cThe team was still pursuing its first Premier League win of the season at the time of Howe\u2019s arrival, however he guided United to 11th place during the 2021/22 campaign, finishing 14 points clear of the bottom three and just two points off the top 10.\u201d\n\n\n\n 2.16pm  \n\nThanks Luke. And here\u2019s an interesting little statistical line that PA Media have just put up about substitute-use, as we head into a season in which five are allowed: Manchester City used their subs\u2019 bench less often than any team in the Premier League or the English Football League last season, PA news agency analysis reveals. Substitutes accounted for only 4.5% of Man City\u2019s Premier League playing time in 2021-22, the lowest share of minutes in England\u2019s top four tiers. \nThough this would appear to go against the line that increasing the number of subs would favour the big teams, it also reflects the squad stability that only the richest clubs are usually able to maintain.\n\n\n\n 2.02pm  \n\nThat\u2019s all from me \u2013 back to Tom Davies to guide you through the rest of the big Premier League countdown ...\n\n\n\n 1.58pm  \n\nHere, in video form, is John Brewin\u2019s view on how Wolves are shaping up for the Premier League season ahead:\n\n\n\n\n 1.52pm  \n\nNow, some transfer news from the Women\u2019s Super League:\nChelsea have made the Sweden international Johanna Rytting Kaneryd their fifth summer signing. The winger joins on a three-year deal, with an option to extend for another year.\nThe 25-year old, who will wear the No 19 shirt, joins after scoring 15 goals in 55 appearances for BK H\u00e4cken, and featured in all the Swedish club\u2019s Champions League group matches last season.\n\n\n\nUpdated at 1.53pm BST\n\n\n 1.50pm  \nTen Hag plays down Ronaldo row\n\nThe Manchester United manager Erik ten Hag has played down the controversy over Cristiano Ronaldo leaving last Sunday\u2019s friendly against Rayo Vallecano early.\n\u201cThere were many players who left, but the spotlight is on Cristiano and that is not right,\u201d Ten Hag said. \u201cSo I think then do your research and make out many players left, that was what was said ... He was part of it. Again, there were a lot of players.\u201d \nAsked about Ronaldo\u2019s position at the club, Ten Hag said: \u201cI\u2019m really happy. I told you before, we plan with the season (with him). We have a top striker and I\u2019m really happy he\u2019s here, he\u2019s in the squad and we stick to that plan.\u201d\nAnd will he play against Brighton? \u201cWe will see Sunday.\u201d \nThe manager also confirmed that Anthony Martial will not be available on Sunday: \u201cYes (he is out),\u201d Ten Hag said. \u201cIt\u2019s always difficult to say (the timescale). I hope not too long.\u201d\n(Quotes from PA Media)\n\nUpdated at 1.55pm BST\n\n\n 1.45pm  \n\n\u201cOur aim is to win every game,\u201d says Erik ten Hag.\nNot exactly what you\u2019d call an original thought from the new Manchester United manager, but an admirable ambition, nonetheless.\n\n\n\n\n 1.43pm  \n\nAston Villa begin their Premier League campaign against Bournemouth tomorrow. The Villa manager Steven Gerrard is hoping his team can make a step up this season.\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be a very tough challenge but I feel like we\u2019re ready,\u201d Gerrard said. \u201cI\u2019m looking for the best version of us ... we need to find a better level of consistency, so we can operate in the top half of the table ... we want to be better without the ball and be a very tough team to play against.\u201d\n\n\n\n 1.36pm  \n\nA couple of choice lines from Erik ten Hag\u2019s lunchtime press conference before Manchester United\u2019s Premier League opener against Brighton on Sunday:\n\u201cI\u2019m convinced we have a good squad ... We can still strengthen the squad, but I think the team is showing they can play to a good level.\n\u201cWe need players ... you don\u2019t need any player, you need the right player.\u201d\nOn Cristiano Ronaldo: \u201cI am really happy he is here ... we have a top striker.\u201d\n\n\nUpdated at 1.40pm BST\n\n\n 1.31pm  \n\nEddie Howe has warned Newcastle United fans that financial fair play regulations will prevent him from spending heavily in the transfer market for some years to come.\nDespite the vast wealth of their new Saudi Arabian owners, Newcastle have still to develop the commercial revenue streams which would enable them to invest significantly in players while remaining within the rules.\n\n\n\n\n 1.18pm  \n\nThe Manchester United manager Erik ten Hag is speaking to the media around now, before the match against Brighton at Old Trafford on Sunday ... we will bring you some quotes from him as soon as humanly possible.\n\n\n\n 1.13pm  \n\n\u201cJamaica is a very beautiful country but, you know, it has its good sides and bad sides.\u201d\nBen Fisher speaks to the Aston Villa winger Leon Bailey on his friends Usain Bolt and Raheem Sterling, working under Steven Gerrard and finally feeling ready to shine:\n\n\nUpdated at 1.13pm BST\n\n\n 1.10pm  \n\nBen Fisher has an update on Morgan-Gibbs White of Wolves: as reported last night by Will Unwin, Nottingham Forest had submitted a club-record bid for the midfielder yesterday, but Ben now reports that the bid has been rejected.\n\n\nUpdated at 2.01pm BST\n\n\n 1.04pm  \n\nA story via PA Media:\nNottingham Forest have been charged by the Football Association after their fans invaded the pitch following their Sky Bet Championship play-off semi-final win over Sheffield United last season.\nForest beat the Blades on penalties after the two-legged tie ended 3-3 on aggregate to book their place at Wembley but there were unsavoury scenes as fans poured on to the pitch, with one of them headbutting United skipper Billy Sharp. Forest season ticket holder Robert Biggs was sent to prison after his attack and other United players were involved in exchanges with Forest fans.\nOli McBurnie will stand trial in December after denying a charge of assault by beating after an alleged incident while Rhian Brewster had the same charge against him dropped last week.

He joins an injury list which already includes Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain (hamstring), Diogo Jota (thigh), Curtis Jones (calf), second-choice goalkeeper Caoimhin Kelleher (groin) and Kostas Tsimikas, with Naby Keita set to resume training on Friday after almost a week out with illness. \n\u201cWe have too many injuries, that\u2019s true,\u201d said the Reds boss. \u201cBut in the moment nothing has changed (in terms of new signings). A lot of unlucky situations. Started with Caoimh and Diogo, pretty much one was injured and one had a re-injury. In a few weeks\u2019 time they will be back, but they\u2019ve missed pre-season and that\u2019s not cool. \n\u201cIbou in a challenge in the game against Strasbourg, what happened there we have to see how long it will take but he\u2019s out for a while. But we cannot solve a problem we have for four weeks with a transfer for a full year. That makes at the moment no sense to us. The transfer window is still open and we will see but the plans are not to go in that direction.\u201d (PA Media)\n\n\n\n 12.42pm  \n\nAs the Chelsea gaffer Tommy Tuchel mentioned a few minutes ago, the deal for Cucurella means Levi Colwill is free to go on loan ... and he\u2019s off to Brighton, as evidenced by the Seagulls\u2019 recent tweet:\n\n\n\n\n 12.38pm  \n\nIt\u2019s official! Marc Cucurella is a Chelsea player, and we can all finally move on. \nThe deal is worth an eye-watering \u00a362million including add-ons \u2013 here is the story from Fabrizio Romano:\n\n\n\n\n 12.35pm  \n\nThanks Tom. Hello everyone. Following that mention of Shane Duffy\u2019s loan move to Fulham, the kind people at the Press Association have done a little story:\nRepublic of Ireland defender Shane Duffy has joined Fulham on a season-long loan from Brighton. Duffy, 30, had previously spent the 2020-21 campaign on loan in Scotland with Celtic, making 27 appearances before returning to the Amex Stadium last term and running out for the Seagulls 20 times. \n\u201cI am delighted that is it is done, it is a really exciting challenge for me and the club,\u201d Duffy told the Fulham website. \u201cIt happened really quickly, but I didn\u2019t really have time to think about it at all, as soon as they came in for me, I just knew it was right for me. I spoke to the manager and it was the same both ways, so I am really excited.\u201d \nSeagulls head coach Graham Potter is confident Duffy will benefit from regular game time with the Cottagers. \u201cShane has been an outstanding servant to this club, and is rightly held in high esteem by everyone here,\u201d Potter told Brighton\u2019s website. \u201cThere was no pressure on him to leave, but typically he wanted to play regular football, and while he was still part of our wider squad, we could not guarantee him that. This move will give him that opportunity, which is really important to him as the captain of the Republic of Ireland, and Fulham are getting a player who has great experience at this level.\u201d\n\n\nUpdated at 12.54pm BST\n\n\n 12.30pm  \n\nAnd with that, I\u2019ll hand you over to Luke McLaughlin for a bit. See you later.\n\nUpdated at 12.31pm BST\n\n\n 12.25pm  \n\nThomas Tuchel speaks:\nOn the Marc Cucurella deal: \u201cThe paperwork is in process and hopefully we can get it finished before noon and Marc is our player. He is a fantastic young player. Hungry, mobile, very intelligent player. Can play several positions in our system, that\u2019s why we hope the transfer goes through and then if it goes through, it opens some options like for Levi Colwill to maybe find some more game time elsewhere.\u201d\nOn the World Cup the splitting season into two:\n\u201cHopefully not (another mid-season World Cup again) after. It does not make so much sense. You feel it. The players are very focused on this World Cup already, which is a good thing because they come in shape and take care about themselves. It is also a bad thing. They are focused on the World Cup and not here. A part of them, I have a feeling, is already thinking about November. We will see how it influences the players and the performances in October when it gets closer, then it will be for me a huge impact emotionally and physically on the guys that go to the World Cup. They will come back drained physically but also mentally with big success, big emotions, positive or huge disappointment, you never know. Then, right away, four or five days later, we have Boxing Day. Let\u2019s see. Nobody did it before. We feel already and the talks with the players, the excitement, which is normal and a good thing. We try to turn it around and use it for us but I am a bit uncertain of all this.\u201d\n\n\n\n 12.22pm  \nChelsea announce signing of Marc Cucurella\n\nIt\u2019s official. Chelsea have confirmed the signing of the Brighton left-back on a six-year deal for \u00a355m plus a potential \u00a37m in add-ons. He might even be able to play at Everton tomorrow. Cucurella told the Chelsea website: \u201cI\u2019m really happy. It\u2019s a big opportunity for me to join one of the best clubs in the world and I\u2019m going to work hard to be happy here and help the team.\u201d\nAnd a club-record wedge heading Brighton\u2019s way:\n\nSome Brighton-fan reaction from BTL, care of cavelier5: \u201cRe Cucurella selling someone for \u00a355m 11 months after signing him for a 5th of that is a no-brainer. Brilliant bit of business and you have to admire the way they held out for the right price. Bissouma will be the harder one to replace I think.\u201d\n\nUpdated at 12.26pm BST\n\n\n 12.14pm  \n\nIn his first presser as a Premier League manager, Steve Cooper batted away talk about his contract situation as he enters the final 12 months of his Nottingham Forest contract.\n\u201cI don\u2019t really think about it to be honest, not something that enters my mind,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m more interested in the team and trying to deliver the right training sessions and I\u2019m just not interested in personal stuff.\n\u201cAm I happy? Yeah, double happy. Every day it\u2019s an honour and a privilege to be here. It\u2019s not something I spend too much time thinking about.\u201d\nForest visit Newcastle tomorrow where the outspoken Dean Henderson will play, but Omar Richards (leg) and Ryan Yates (knee) are out.\n\n\n\n 12.08pm  \n\nOur final Premier League pre-season preview has dropped, in which John Brewin discusses the prospects of one of the league\u2019s \u201cenigma\u201d teams, Wolves:\n\n\n\n\n 12.06pm  \n\nMartin Tyler has apologised over his Hillsborough remarks:\n\u201cThere is no connection at all between the Hillsborough disaster and hooliganism \u2013 I know that, and I was not implying that there was. I apologise sincerely and wholeheartedly for any misunderstanding.\u201d\n\nBy the way there is, I think, a side-debate to be had about another thing Tyler said earlier \u2013 \u201cYou have got to remember football was in a bit of a crisis at that time [of the Premier League\u2019s creation].\u201d Was football really in crisis in 1992? After six consecutive seasons of rising attendances, hooliganism on the wane, and the game already surfing a post-Italia 90 wave? It fits a neat Premier League narrative but the reality was more complex.\n\nUpdated at 12.27pm BST\n\n\n 11.59am  \n\nSo what of Spurs this season? Their squad has had major surgery since Antonio Conte arrived last season, and David Hytner divines what long-term signings such as Djed Spence mean for the ambitions of Conte and Tottenham here:\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/aug/05/conte-caution-on-spence-signing-shows-how-far-spurs-hope-to-go\n\n\n\n 11.46am  \n\nNottingham Forest have been charged by the FA over the unruly pitch invasion at the end of their playoff semi-final win over Sheffield United in May. Here\u2019s PA Media\u2019s story:\n\nNottingham Forest have been charged by the Football Association after their fans invaded the pitch following their Sky Bet Championship play-off semi-final win over Sheffield United last season.\nForest beat the Blades on penalties after the two-legged tie ended 3-3 on aggregate to book their place at Wembley but there were unsavoury scenes as fans poured on to the pitch, with one of them headbutting United skipper Billy Sharp.\nForest season ticket holder Robert Biggs was sent to jail after his attack and other United players were involved in exchanges with Forest fans.\nOli McBurnie will stand trial in December after denying a charge of assault by beating after an alleged incident while Rhian Brewster had the same charge against him dropped last week.\nThe FA has now charged Forest with a breach of Rule E20. \nAn FA statement read: \u201cNottingham Forest has been charged with a breach of FA Rule E20 following their EFL Championship fixture against Sheffield United FC on Tuesday 17 May 2022.\n\u201cIt is alleged that Nottingham Forest FC failed to ensure that its spectators, and all persons purporting to be its supporters or followers, conducted themselves in an orderly fashion and refrained from using threatening and/or violent behaviour whilst encroaching onto the pitch area, following the completion of the fixture.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n 11.38am  \n\nLoan news: Fulham have signed Shane Duffy on a season-long loan from Brighton. Not all our writers are convinced:\n\nIt\u2019s a busy old morning for transfer news \u2013 would be interested to see how Brighton fans feel about the likely loss of Cucurella to Chelsea, and how it impacts their prospects after such an enjoyable 2021-22 campaign.\n\n\n\n 11.29am  \n\nMore transfer news: Amadou Onana is having a medical at Everton after a deal was agreed to sign the Lille midfielder, pipping West Ham, who\u2019d also been keen on Onana. And Bourneouth have agreed a deal for the Barcelona goalkeeper Neto\nOn that subject, here\u2019s a roundup of the latest transfer tittle-tattle, stuff and nonsense from the Rumour Mill:\n\n\n\n\n 11.26am  \n\nJ\u00fcrgen Klopp\u2019s been talking about Liverpool\u2019s trip to Fulham, whom he praises for the manner of their promotion last season. \u201cGetting promoted through playing football is one of the hardest things to do,\u201d he said, \u201cand that\u2019s what Fulham did, they\u2019re a really good team \u2026 it\u2019ll be tough, but I\u2019m happy that we played the City game [in the Community Shield] to be honest it gave us a hint of where we are.\u201d Klopp pours cold water on the idea of additional signings at the moment, adding: \u201cWe have too many injuries at the moment thats true but at the moment nothing changes.\u201d\n\n\n\n 11.06am  \n\n\u201cYou might have an article today with Sky Sports bigging themselves up in comparison to BT Sport,\u201d writes Colin Stevens. \u201cBut that still doesn\u2019t stop individuals in their team making horrendous gaffes. See this tweet from the supreme Ms Shelagh Fogarty\n\nIt would be great to get some response from Mr Tyler, Sky Sports &amp; the Today programme.\u201d\nAn insensitive gaffe indeed. One expects more from Tyler.\n\n\n\n 11.02am  \n\nOur latest Premier League pre-season preview spotlights West Ham, looking to build on a season full of fun and frolics in 2021-22, even if there was a sense they were falling away towards the end of the season. It could be tough living up to raised expectations, reckons Jacob Steinberg, who asks whether David Moyes\u2019s side might have gone a bit stale:\n\n\n\n\n 10.43am  \n\nNewcastle haven\u2019t been as free-spending in this transfer window as many predicted, but their search for new recruits continues. But Eddie Howe has insisted the club will operate under spending restrictions for \u201cyears\u201d despite all that Saudi cash behind them.\n\u201cFinancial Fair Play will impact us, will continue to impact us, I think, for a number of years,\u201d said the Newastle manager. \u201cWe haven\u2019t got the free rein, the free hand that maybe has been perceived in the media, that we can go and sign whoever we want and pay extortionate fees and wages. \n\u201cWe\u2019re not in that position and I don\u2019t think we will be for some period of time. We\u2019re having to be creative and smart and try to make the right additions with the financial restraints that we have.\u201d\n\n\n\n 10.25am  \n\nChelsea are on the verge of securing the signing of Marc Cucurella from Brighton, according to Sky Sports News. The full-back, one of the most impressive players in the top flight last season, has of course been gossiped about as a Manchester City target all summer. \nIn the WSL, champions Chelsea have signed the Sweden winger Johanna Rytting Kaneryd on a three-year deal.\n\n\n\n 10.20am  \n\nManchester City may have recruited a stunningly gifted and efficient robo-striker in Erling Haaland but might they be about to lose the artistic talents of Bernardo Silva? \u201cWhat happens will happen,\u201d said Pep Guardiola, \u201cand if he stays it is perfect and in the end if he has to leave it is because football is like this; the player has a desire. I will not be a person to stop a desire for the people. When you are a football player it is so short, you don\u2019t realise and it is nearly over. The player will have to talk to the club and I have never ever been involved in that.\u201d\nJamie Jackson has the story:\n\n\n\n\n 10.13am  \n\nAnd here\u2019s a spot more eve-of-season reading, from Barney Ronay on the strangeness of a season to be abruptly interrupted by the most controversial of World Cups:\n\nAnd here\u2019s David Hills on some other things we\u2019ll have to get used to, such as five subs, a new official ball and some out-there new kits:\n\n\nUpdated at 10.20am BST\n\n\n 10.11am  \nPreamble\n\nMorning everyone. Yes, the great Premier League juggernaut is back, and though observations that the football season seems to start earlier each year \u2013 like those about police officers and football managers looking younger these days \u2013 have begun to seem weary and cliched, this season really has ambushed us early (EFL games in July, I ask you!).\nEngland has at least had a week to bask in the unfamiliar sensation of Euro 2022 glory, before the more familiar sensations of the top flight\u2019s big kick-off are upon us. And it starts, as last year\u2019s did, with Arsenal facing a testing away game in London against opponents who can raise their game against them. Selhurst Park should be lively tonight as Patrick Vieira seeks to inflict another bruising defeat on his old club, who nonetheless go in to the new season with optimism (cautiously) higher than it has been for a while.\nThe defending champions, Manchester City, face a testing start at West Ham in one of the more intriguing fixtures of the weekend, while their closest challengers in 2021-22, Liverpool visit a Fulham side hoping to step off the alternating promotion/relegation merry-go-round.\nWe\u2019ll have all the latest team news, media conference tidbits and random gossip and comment through the day. And to start us all off, here\u2019s 10 things to look out for this weekend:\n\n\n"

                    "body": "A same-sex kiss has been added back to upcoming Disney-Pixar film Lightyear after being cut, according to a report in Variety. The animated prequel for Toy Story\u2019s Buzz Lightyear features a relationship between two female characters, one voiced by three-time Emmy winner Uzo Aduba. A kiss between the two had originally been removed but following recent uproar related to Disney\u2019s handling of both LGBTQ characters and the recent \u201cdon\u2019t say gay\u201d bill, it has reportedly been restored.  The move follows a letter released by LGBTQ Pixar employees, which claimed that Disney executives had insisted \u201covertly gay affection\u201d was removed from all animated features. \u201cWe at Pixar have personally witnessed beautiful stories, full of diverse characters, come back from Disney corporate reviews shaved down to crumbs of what they once were,\u201d it read. It was in response to Disney\u2019s mishandling of the recent Florida bill that seeks to ban teaching of sexual identity and gender orientation in early-grade education as well as in \u201ca manner that is not age-appropriate or developmentally appropriate for students\u201d. After Disney initially remained quiet on the bill, it was then revealed that every politician who sponsored it had received donations from the studio. An internal statement from the CEO, Bob Chapek, said that the studio would \u201cunequivocally stand\u201d with LGBTQ employees but said that a public statement could be \u201cweaponised\u201d. This week then saw Disney staff stage a walkout in protest with Chapek then agreeing to pause all political donations in Florida. The inclusion of a same-sex kiss in Lightyear would mark a major milestone for LGBTQ representation. In 2020\u2019s Onward, Lena Waithe voiced a lesbian cop but her girlfriend was never seen. The brief scene led to the film being banned in Kuwait, Oman, Qatar and Saudi Arabia. Lightyear, featuring the voice of Chris Evans as the central character, will be released theatrically in June."

You can read the Guardian\u2019s extensive coverage, which includes reports from Doha, Buenos Aires and Paris, here. Australia\u2019s foreign affairs minister, Penny Wong, will fly to China this week to mark a key diplomatic milestone in the latest sign of easing tensions between the two countries. Victoria police have charged three men in relation to the mass pitch invasion at the A-League Men Melbourne derby on Saturday.

Updated at 7.28am GMT    7.06am   NSW government settles Widjabul Wia-bal native title claim  The federal court has recognised the Widjabul Wia-bal people hold native title over more than 11,500 hectares around the Lismore area in northern NSW. On Monday, the NSW government settled a native title claim over public land and waters in the Northern Rivers area including flood-ravaged Lismore in a historic court sitting in Goonellabah, reports AAP. The decision means native title holders have legally recognised rights to access the parks and practise their culture in parks, including camping and using resources. Ashley Moran, a Widjabul Wia-bal claimant, told hundreds of Indigenous residents in attendance the arduous process had taken more than 20 years to be finalised. \u201cNative title recognition is a long process that started from the efforts of a number of elders way back in 2002,\u201d he said. The 1992 high court success of Eddie Mabo, a Meriam man, recognised native title in Australian law for the first time. Attorney general Mark Speakman said the court\u2019s determination marked an important moment for the Widjabul Wia-bal of the Bundjalung Nation, who have cared for the land and waters for thousands of years.  Appearing in court as NSW\u2019s first law officer, Speakman provided oral submissions on behalf of the state.\u201cWe recognise what the Widjabul Wia-bal have always known \u2013 this is Widjabul Wia-bal land,\u201d Speakman said.\u201cThe Widjabul Wia-bal and the NSW government have worked together to deliver the Widjabul Wia-bal\u2019s vision for greater land management opportunities, economic prosperity and employment opportunities.\u201d \u201cToday is both a solemn and joyous occasion\u201d, the attorney general said in a packed gym on Monday. \u201cSolemn because of the gravity of the Widjabul Wia-bal being formally recognised by this court as the native title holders of this area under their traditional laws and customs.\u201d \u201cJoyous because your honour will recognise what the Widjabul Wia-bal people have always been told by their old people \u2013 that this is their country, always was and always will be\u201d.  Updated at 7.17am GMT    7.04am   Search for missing bushwalker last seen three weeks ago in Victoria\u2019s east  Meanwhile, a forest search is under way in Victoria\u2019s east for a missing bushwalker who was last seen three weeks ago. The Paynesville man\u2019s orange Subaru was found abandoned on a remote track in the Colquhoun Forest in East Gippsland on Saturday night, reports AAP. The man, known as Geoffrey, was last seen by neighbours about three weeks ago although it\u2019s not known what date he left to go on his hike. Police believe the 75-year-old may have travelled to the area to observe bats near the Den of Nargan cave system. There are concerns for Geoffrey\u2019s welfare as he has several medical conditions that require regular medication. A large search involving the air wing and dog squad was under way on Monday afternoon. Geoffrey is described as being 180cm tall with a medium build, blue eyes, a pale complexion and white hair and beard.  Updated at 7.23am GMT    6.52am    Victorian couple missing in state\u2019s south-west found  Two people who went missing in Victoria\u2019s south-west have been found alive and well, reports AAP. The couple set off from Oakleigh East in Melbourne\u2019s east on Friday to go four-wheel driving but failed to return to pick up their dogs from family on Sunday night. Police searched the Grampians national park for the 50-year-old Murrumbeena man and 37-year-old Oakleigh East woman after they were last seen leaving Dunkeld on Sunday morning. Police on Monday afternoon confirmed the pair had been found safe and well. It\u2019s understood their car became bogged in the vicinity of Glenelg River Road in the Grampians. One of them was able to walk out of bushland and notify authorities, a police spokesperson said. Neither person was injured and both declined treatment from paramedics.  Updated at 6.57am GMT    6.37am   Calls for Penny Wong to raise human rights concerns on Beijing trip  Human rights advocates have called on Penny Wong to raise the case of Australians and their family members who may be missing or wrongfully detained in China when the foreign minister visits Beijing this week. Human Rights Watch has also called on Wong to raise concerns about human rights in Xinjiang when she meets with Chinese officials on Wednesday at events to mark the 50th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between Australia and China. Elaine Pearson, Asia director at Human Rights Watch, said \u201chuman rights should be a central component\u201d of Wong\u2019s trip, \u201cgiven she will be meeting with leaders of a government that have committed serious abuses that may amount to crimes against humanity, according to the UN\u201d. Pearson said:  Before leaving, we hope that Wong has taken the time to meet with victims and survivors of Chinese government human rights violations, including those with family members still in China. Australian officials should compile lists of Australian citizens\u2019 and permanent residents\u2019 family members missing, forcibly disappeared, or wrongfully detained in China, and specifically ask Foreign Minister Wang Yi for their freedom. Wong and the Australian delegation should also make themselves available to meet with independent activists in China.  Pearson also said that \u201cWong is no doubt under pressure from the Chinese government to downplay human rights in this first high level visit for years \u2013 a standard to which Beijing will try to hold other democracies\u201d. \u201cThis is all the more reason for Wong to demonstrate her government\u2019s commitment to human rights bilaterally as well as in forums such as the United Nations.\u201d  Updated at 6.57am GMT    6.12am    Not kept up with the day\u2019s news? Check out Guardian Australia\u2019s afternoon update:      5.52am   Three charged over A-League Melbourne Derby pitch invasion  Victoria police have charged three men in relation to the mass pitch invasion at the A-League Mens Melbourne Derby on Saturday. All three of the men, aged 23, 19 and 18, presented at police stations on Monday, Victoria police said in a statement. The 23-year-old man, from Craigieburn, was charged in relation to an alleged incident involving Melbourne City\u2019s goalkeeper, Thomas Glover, who was struck in the head by a metal bucket full of sand. He was charged with violent disorder, discharge missile, intent to cause injury, recklessly cause injury, unlawful assault, entry to sporting competition space, disrupting a match, public nuisance and riotous behaviour. The 19-year-old man, from Meadow Heights, was charged in relation to a separate alleged assault on Glover, as well as an alleged assault on a security guard. He was charged with violent disorder, discharge missile, three counts of unlawful assault, entry to competition space, disrupting a match, public nuisance, riotous behaviour, discharge and possess flare. The 18-year-old man, from Alphington, was charged in relation to the separate assault on Glover, as well as criminal damage caused to the venue, AAMI Park stadium. He was charged with violent disorder, criminal damage, unlawful assault, entry to competition space, disrupting a match, public nuisance and riotous behaviour. All three of the men have been bailed to appear before Melbourne magistrates court on 27 February. Detectives are continuing to investigate Saturday night\u2019s incident, including trawling through vision of the pitch invasion, and have appealed to the public for assistance. They believe more than 150 football fans ran on to the field. Police believe approximately 50 flares were lit within the stands and at least three were thrown on to the field, four men were injured during the incident, including a goalkeeper, cameraman and two security guards. Approximately $120,000 worth of damage was caused to the venue, with bottles were thrown at the Public Order Response Team who responded on the field. Earlier on Monday, the game\u2019s governing body, Football Australia, told Melbourne Victory it had until Wednesday morning to respond to a show-cause notice issued to the club.

Gippsland\u2019s coast in south Victoria will be home to the turbines, with the heavy winds of the Bass Strait offering plenty of wild weather to power Australian homes. The zoned area covers about 15,000 sq km from Lakes Entrance in the east to south of Wilsons Promontory in the west. The projects are expected to support more than 3,000 jobs over the next 15 years in development and construction phases and an extra 3,000 ongoing operation jobs.

Premier Dominic Perrottet has announced the parliament - which had been in recess ahead of the next state election in March - will resume for a special sitting to pass the relief package agreed to in National Cabinet. The legislation had already passed federal parliament, but elements of the plan need to be passed by the states. The package will see the price of black coal capped at $125 a tonne and the price of gas at $12 a gigajoule. The commonwealth has agreed to transfer $1.5bn to the states and territories to cut energy bills for eligible households and small businesses. Perrottet said:  The NSW government has worked carefully with the commonwealth to secure a package which will provide financial relief for NSW households and businesses facing increased energy costs while also supporting industry to ensure energy security across the electricity grid.The cap on coal and gas prices will help drive down the cost of energy for households and businesses in NSW, with commonwealth modelling showing that the caps will provide an estimated average saving of $230 per household.The actions we take here in NSW will also deliver price relief for customers right across Australia.\u201d   Updated at 4.29am GMT    4.03am    Labor criticised over school funding policy  The Albanese government has been accused of betraying public schools after delaying a new funding agreement by one year. On Friday, the council of education ministers decided to extend the deal until December 2024, meaning governments will not have to increase public school funding beyond existing commitments until 2025. The federal education minister, Jason Clare, defended the delay as necessary to conduct a review to ensure funding is directed to the neediest students, but the Australian Education Union (AEU) has warned \u201cresources delayed are resources denied\u201d. Public schools receive 20% of the schooling resourcing standard (SRS) from the federal government and up to 75% from the states, but due to a loophole for capital depreciation, are set to remain at 91% of full funding for the rest of the decade.

I hand you over to the excellent Elias Visontay.     2.28am   Knife threats and flashing reported amid spike in customer aggression this Christmas trading period  Retail workers are seeing a spike in customer aggression this Christmas trading period, including being flashed and threatened, retail groups are warning. Australia\u2019s peak retail body, the Australian Retailers Association (ARA) and the Shop, Distributive and Allied Employees Association (SDA) have released a joint statement \u201cpleading for civility and mutual respect\u201d towards retail workers. The statement has laid bare how bad the situation can get, with reported instances in retail stores during Christmas trading this year including:  A retail worker flashed by a customer at work. A customer pulling a knife on a staff member. A worker threatened with physical violence and threats made against their life. Customers becoming abusive when denied discounts. A customer throwing a product at a staff member because their refund was refused.  The spike in aggression comes as labour shortages across the sector, combined with ongoing supply chain issues, are creating \u201cunprecedented levels of anxiety\u201d according to the two associations. SDA\u2019s national secretary, Gerard Dwyer, said there is no excuse for abusing retail and fast-food workers.  We know that Christmas is always a busy time for everyone, as the pressure builds up getting ready for end of season festivities. But even with seasonal stress, there\u2019s just no excuse for abusing retail and fast-food workers. No one deserves to turn up to work with the fear of being abused. We\u2019ve also found young workers, women and workers from diverse linguistic backgrounds can be disproportionately singled out for mistreatment. This Christmas season, make sure to stay calm and show kindness to workers and fellow shoppers \u2013 and make it a joyful season for everyone.  ARA\u2019s CEO, Paul Zahra, says:  We must remember that these workers are sacrificing precious time in the holiday season to ensure shoppers can treat their loved ones \u2013 and with staff shortages and frenzied demand, there\u2019s obviously going to be some hiccups and longer queues particularly in the last week before Christmas day.

As of yesterday, 164 people in NSW have reported symptoms after eating baby spinach and at least 42 of these people have sought medical attention. NSW Health are still advising people not to consume several baby spinach products following a national recall due to cases of possible food-related toxic reactions. The full list of affected baby spinach products are listed on the Food Standards Australia New Zealand website and the community is urged to regularly check the website for updates. NSW Health:  NSW Health advises the recalled products are not safe to consume and people who have purchased these recalled products should throw them out or return them to the place of purchase for a full refund. Anyone who has eaten spinach and is experiencing symptoms, please call the Poisons Information Centre on 13 11 26. NSW Health urges anyone who experiences any unusual and severe symptoms to seek immediate medical attention by visiting their nearest emergency department. In the event of an emergency, call Triple Zero (000).  Reported symptoms can be severe, including:  Delirium or confusion Hallucinations Dilated pupils Rapid heartbeat Flushed face Blurred vision Dry mouth  To understand how the spinach came to be toxic, my colleague Tamsin Rose spoke to experts about how a weed has likely caused the situation following flooding:   Updated at 2.16am GMT    1.53am   Coalition welcomes Wong's trip to Beijing  The Coalition has welcomed plans by the foreign affairs minister, Penny Wong, to travel to Beijing for talks this week. Wong\u2019s predecessor, Marise Payne, last visited Beijing four years ago \u2013 in November 2018 \u2013 but the then trade minister Simon Birmingham also visited China\u2019s capital in 2019. Birmingham, who is now the Coalition\u2019s foreign affairs spokesperson, welcomed Wong\u2019s trip:  I wish minister Wong well in her pursuit with the Chinese government of productive discussions and outcomes positive to our national interest.  He said it was \u201calways counterproductive for the Chinese government to cease ministerial dialogue for a period of time\u201d. Birmingham said he also welcomed the Albanese government\u2019s maintenance of the Morrison government\u2019s key policy settings even as it stepped up the push for dialogue. He also set a high bar for success:  It is welcome that the Albanese government has continued the former Coalition government\u2019s recognition of the strategic challenges Australia faces and important that they pursue the stabilisation of Australia-China relations while remaining committed to protecting Australia\u2019s national interests. The ultimate test of any dialogue lies in the outcomes achieved. Minister Wong\u2019s visit will be judged on progress towards the removal of unwarranted tariffs and sanctions on Australian exports; achieving fair and transparent treatment of Australians currently detained in China; advancing regional security via respect for international law; and securing greater transparency on human rights issues of concern. Australia should also continue to appeal for China to use its influence on Russia to end the immoral and illegal invasion of Ukraine.

The 38 mayors from 7 states and territories, have also committed to civic education of their communities about the importance of the referendum. Darcy Byrne, the mayor of the Inner West Council which has recruited 800 citizens to undertake training about the Uluru Statement, said local government has a crucial role to play:  Mayors from across the continent, representing urban, regional and remote communities, have come together to say that public awareness about this historic referendum must be built from the grassroots up. We are all ready to help inform and educate our communities about the Uluru Statement and create conversations about the referendum in suburbs and towns throughout Australia.  Thomas Mayo, a campaigner for From the Heart, said \u201cit is local community support that will drive a successful referendum campaign,\u201d adding that he looked forward to partnering with councils on the initiative. The 38 Mayors for the Voice to Parliament have said in a joint statement:  We the undersigned endorse the Uluru Statement from the Heart and support constitutional recognition for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people through a Voice to Parliament. As local leaders we are committed to building awareness in our communities about the upcoming referendum. Our citizens should be informed about what constitutional recognition through a Voice to Parliament will mean for Indigenous people and Australian society as a whole. Local government must play an important role in holding civic forums, promoting dialogue, and providing a platform for Indigenous voices to be heard in the debate. We believe that a successful referendum can be a unifying achievement for Australia. We are ready to work with all levels of government to educate and inform our communities about why this referendum is such an important moment for our nation.

The state government is working with non-government agencies to provide direct support from Monday as more people face warnings to leave their properties. That includes financial advice and small amounts of cash for emergency living expenses such as food or fuel. The help comes amid the latest flood warnings for residents. A number of watch and act messages remain in place along sections of the Murray River, including low-lying areas of Tailem Bend and Murray Bridge, east of Adelaide. On the weekend, there was a breach in the levee at Ponde while a levee protecting the hotel at Overland Corner was reported to be failing. About 4,000 properties across the length of the Murray in SA are expected to be inundated, with more than 1,100 flooded so far. The high water mark is likely to hit Renmark, near the Victorian border, between Christmas and New Year, and then reach Murray Bridge by January 17. Peak flows are still forecast to be between 190GL and 220GL a day. They are then expected to drop back to about 150GL a day by February, allowing clean-up work to begin. The SA government has provided a $51.6m assistance package, including support for tourism and other businesses, as well as direct emergency payments to homeowners. The flood event will be the worst in SA since the Murray rose to record levels in 1956. - from AAP  Updated at 1.15am GMT    12.54am    MPs celebrate festive period with local communities With parliament all wrapped up for the year, MPs are getting into the holiday spirit in their local communities.

As our deputy opinion editor, Svetlana Stankovic, writes, it\u2019s a topic that\u2019s not discussed in the open, leaving women to put up with it in silence:  Half the population goes through a huge biological and psychological change right around the time when there should be nothing stopping you from being at the peak of your career. As professional women in our 40s and 50s we have been told we can do anything. And then along comes menopause with symptoms that are irritating at best, and debilitating in some cases. Up to a quarter of menopausal women experience severe symptoms that can lead to long-term absences from work or even early retirement. In Australia there has been slightly more media coverage recently as the New South Wales government in November opened two menopause health hubs with two more due to open next year, but menopause still isn\u2019t a mainstream issue to talk about. Like puberty or pregnancy, it is a transition to a new phase of life, but it\u2019s not one that is usually celebrated. Most women dread it. It has been sold to us as the ultimate expiration date for relevance and visibility.

A parliamentary committee is reviewing proposed changes to Australian referendum law to ensure it is brought into the 21st century. Existing law was last used for the 1999 republic referendum and the parliament is reviewing it, given the updates to electoral processes, communication methods and technology since then. Representatives from the Australian Electoral Commission as well as a panel of legal, electoral and constitutional experts will appear before the committee today. Committee chair Kate Thwaites said experts would advise how proposed changes will modernise how referendums are held in Australia:  While I know many are interested in highlighting views on issues like the referendum question, amendments to the constitution or the merits of the voice to parliament, it\u2019s important to note that this inquiry will not be examining these matters.

The paper\u2019s political editor Simon Benson and chief political correspondent Geoff Chambers report:  The Australian understands that a key finding of the report, which will be handed to the federal executive this week, is that the grassroots of the party had collapsed amid a failure to reflect local communities. Too many states were now also controlled by factional arrangements, were being ruled by personality cults and fiefdoms with little incentives to change because of the fear of losing internal power. It is understood that a key recommendation in the review \u2013 led by former Liberal Party federal \u00addirector Brian Loughnane and opposition finance spokeswoman Jane Hume \u2013 will be to break the stranglehold of those in control of the state divisions.      10.35pm   Covid-19 vaccinations saved Australian economy more than $180bn  Australia\u2019s rollout of Covid-19 vaccinations is estimated to have reduced the impact of the pandemic on the economy to the tune of $181bn, new modelling shows. The peer-reviewed research paper, The Value of Vaccines: A Tale of Two Parts, calculated the pandemic and resultant lockdowns would have delivered a $395bn hit to gross domestic product. But following the rollout of vaccines the estimated actual impact was $214bn, resulting in a $181bn positive economic difference from the period starting January 2020. The modelling was undertaken by consultancy Biointelect and Victoria University\u2019s Centre of Policy Studies with the support of vaccine maker Pfizer Australia. It also estimated the uptake of vaccinations contributed to large positive effects for tourism exports ($28bn), education exports ($26bn), employment (142,000 jobs) and government finances ($259bn). Co-author Jennifer Herz, co-founder and managing director of Biointelect, said today:  This demonstrates how important the process put in place for the Covid-19 vaccines was, which is a credit to the (then-Coalition) government and the Therapeutic Goods Administration. Our experience from the pandemic shows we should be thinking more broadly about the benefits of faster access to all available vaccines to our economy and society and consider the wider value new vaccines can provide.  The modelling was published in the journal Vaccines. \u2013 from AAP  Updated at 10.41pm GMT    10.16pm    Argentinia fans celebrate across Australia Argentina supporters have erupted with joy at World Cup match sites across the country after the South American nation clinched the final in a nail-biting penalty shootout.

For some parts of the country, there is a chance of showers:   Here\u2019s what Dean Narramore told ABC News Breakfast:  Particularly in the south, we can get some volatile weather but all the patterns really starting to change as we move into later part of this week. So we\u2019ll see a weather system move through southern parts of the country, Thursday and Friday. Then a big high-pressure system behind it will quickly move into the Tasman Sea and then kind of sit there over the Christmas weekend into early the following week and normally that drives a lot of warm weather across much of southern parts of the country and our guidance is showing a similar pattern with that as well. So at least with southern parts of the country we\u2019re looking pretty good and even on the east coast, maybe a degree or two out, but it\u2019s looking really good.

Are you able to quantify how much the commonwealth spends right now per year to do that?  Tanya Plibersek:  Well, it\u2019s not just commonwealth spending that\u2019s important, of course. I mean, we increased spending in the last budget, we\u2019ve got $1.8bn across budget years to invest in nature. State territory, governments play a role. Philanthropists play a role, business plays some role. And again, we\u2019re hoping that they\u2019ll play a bigger role as we established our nature repair market. Absolutely, of course, we can do better in Australia and that\u2019s our plan. That\u2019s our intention as the government that\u2019s why we\u2019ve already increased environmental funding.  Asked about the next budget, Plibersek said the government is committed to upping funding for nature but that it needs to be a whole-of-society effort as repairing nature comes to be as important a target for businesses as their carbon footprint.  Well, we already saw an increase in the October budget. And we determined not only to increase government funding, but to make it easier for others to invest in repairing nature as well. The last report we saw on the interest from business in investing in nature repair market that is businesses prepared to look at around $137bn worth of incoming nature. This is becoming as important for businesses as reducing their carbon pollution. We\u2019ve got to make sure that all of our investment is effective. So the government investment, both state and commonwealth investments, your private sector, philanthropists, we can work together to make a real difference for Australia\u2019s natural environment.

Plibersek says she believes Australia\u2019s domestic targets of protecting 30% of land and 30% of oceans by 2030, and zero extinctions should be global targets. Despite Sarah Hanson-Young\u2019s criticism this morning that Australia has yet to pledge anything to the summit\u2019s $200bn target, Plibersek says our nation has been a leader at the conference:  Australia has been playing a really positive role in negotiating the final agreement. We\u2019ve really gone from environmental laggard to leader on the world stage. One of the examples of that is the higher ambition statement that we worked out with Norway. A statement to give stronger protection to our oceans that\u2019s been signed on to over the last 24 hours by 37 other countries so it\u2019s just an example I guess is the kind of positive role Australia can play globally.

Updated at 9.22pm GMT    9.11pm   Sarah Hanson-Young urges Australian government to 'put money on the table' at biodiversity Cop  The biodiversity Cop is aiming to reach a target of $200bn through pledges from nations in attendance. Australia is yet to contribute, a move Sarah Hanson-Young is urging the government to reconsider:  Well, it is a lot of money but it is what is needed to save nature to protect our planet and to halt the destruction of all the things that we hold dear. Our trees are plants and native animals. What makes it beautiful and wonderful to be a human being \u2013 to be able to be surrounded by clean air, clean water and clean soil to grow our food. $200bn must be found. I am disappointed in \u2013 and this needs to be understood \u2013 is that despite Australia coming to this conference, talking about the need for the targets and Tanya Plibersek as minister has been very clear on the support for the 30 by 30 target \u2013 we need stronger action on the extinction targets, but no money from Australia was put on the table to help those negotiations come along. We saw a lot of money pledged by countries like Germany. France made another contribution this morning. So other countries are putting money on the table. It\u2019s been disappointing to say Australia hasn\u2019t contributed yet. In these final hours of the negotiations, I urge the Australian government to help help keep ambition high by putting some more money on the table to help because we are a rich country by global standards and there are many other countries in the world where the impact of the environment being destroyed is so significant. They tend to be the poor countries the most vulnerable countries. They do need assistance not just on the land but also in the sea.  You can read more on this topic from environment reporter Lisa Cox:   Updated at 10.26pm GMT    9.05pm    \u2018Absolutely crazy\u2019: Hanson-Young calls on state governments to end native forest logging There\u2019s also a push to commit countries to protecting 30% of the world\u2019s lands and oceans by 2030 at the biodiversity Cop. The Albanese government made that target one of its election promises, but Sarah-Hanson Young says it\u2019s not enough:  But the big question is what happens to that remaining 70%? We need the framework and the rules and the regulations, and the commitment to making sure that that remaining 70% of the world\u2019s landmass and oceans aren\u2019t just destroyed because we are at a tipping point. In Australia alone is ranked third in the world for extinction and threatened species. It is not good enough. We need to change business as usual. Business as usual is pushing us down a path where by 2050 we will lose a koala, by 2030 many more other species will be gone or facing extinction.    We need to put a halt to extinction now. We need to stop destroying the critical habitat. In Australia, that would mean stopping things like stopping native forests logging. It is absolutely crazy that at the same time as we\u2019ve got world leaders talking about plans to restore nature to be planting more trees. Back home in Australia, we have governments that are allowing the destruction of our native forests, whether that\u2019s Victoria, New South Wales or Tasmania, where they are both logging and mining the Tarkine.    Updated at 9.20pm GMT    8.56pm    Biodiversity summit targets \u2018watered down\u2019, Hanson-Young says Greens spokesperson for the environment Sarah Hanson-Young spoke to RN Breakfast from Montreal where she is attending the biodiversity Cop alongside environment minister Tanya Plibersek and independent senator David Pocock. At the summit, 190 countries have been meeting to try to agree on 22 targets to enable the world to halt biodiversity loss but Hanson-Young says \u201cthe key targets around halting and stopping extinction has been watered down significantly\u201d:  The text that was put on the table today and the minister is now finalising is weaker than what many of us wanted \u2013 this was meant to be the \u201cParis\u201d moment for nature and our environment.   Updated at 9.05pm GMT    8.52pm    Housing tops parliament\u2019s new year agenda Affordable housing will be the next parliamentary priority as the federal government releases its promised plan to help ease the crisis. After addressing election commitments to tackle the climate crisis, childcare costs and establish a national anti-corruption commission in 2022, the government has revealed housing as being first on its agenda for 2023. Proposed laws to establish the housing australia future fund as well as two independent advisory bodies have been published. Consultation on the proposals will be open until mid-January before parliament\u2019s return in February. The $10bn future fund is expected to provide ongoing investment returns which will go towards new social and affordable homes. Housing minister Julie Collins said returns from the fund would deliver the government\u2019s commitment of 30,000 new social and affordable homes in the fund\u2019s first five years. This would include 4,000 homes for women and children impacted by family and domestic violence or older women at risk of homelessness. \u2013 from AAP  Updated at 8.55pm GMT    8.46pm   Good morning!  Two of the nine people being sought by Victoria police over Saturday\u2019s pitch invasion at the A-League Men Melbourne derby have made themselves known to investigators. The invasion of the Melbourne Victory/Melbourne City football clash left a player, a referee and a TV camera operator injured.

                    "body": "James Milner has signed a one-year contract extension to stay at Liverpool until the end of next season. The 36-year-old\u2019s deal was due to expire this month and he has accepted a significant pay cut to remain with the club he joined from Manchester City in 2015. Milner is understood to have had offers from at least one other Premier League club and from two teams abroad.\nJ\u00fcrgen Klopp was keen to retain a player who made 39 appearances in the 2021-22 season, 25 as a substitute. Liverpool\u2019s contract proposal was made in February and Milner chose to wait until the end of the season to confirm he would stay.\n\n\u201cI have never taken playing for this club for granted and I never will,\u201d said Milner, who has played in midfield and right-back at Anfield. \u201cAn overriding feeling for me \u2013 and a vitally important one in the process \u2013 was the belief I can still contribute to the team. The gaffer was clear what he thought and that was a big factor in me extending my contract. As long as I can still play my part, that\u2019s not something easy to walk away from.\n\u201cLast season was extraordinary, even though it didn\u2019t have the ending we hoped it would, but I think that will only make us all even hungrier for more success, to be honest. I felt that after the parade and that played a part in my decision-making also. It\u2019s a unique club. Now this is signed, I\u2019m already looking forward to getting back with everyone, refocusing and going again. It\u2019s a brilliant dressing room to be part of.\u201d\nKlopp\u2019s regard for Milner, who has played in midfield and at right-back, was apparent after Liverpool\u2019s victory at Newcastle on 30 April, which the former England international started. \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s difficult to be fitter than Milly,\u201d the manager said. \u201cHe\u2019s a role model. I have told him, I can tell the whole world \u2013 nothing we have achieved in the last few years would have happened without James Milner, it\u2019s as easy as that. Whether he was on the pitch or not, he\u2019s set standards in a way not a lot of people can set standards, and it educated all of us.\u201d\nBayern Munich will continue talks with Liverpool in the coming days in the hope of reaching an agreement to sign Sadio Man\u00e9. The forward wants to leave and personal terms with the Bundesliga champions would not be an issue but Liverpool are reluctant to sell unless they receive a substantial offer for the 30-year-old, who has one year on his contract. Klopp would ideally also want a replacement lined up first."

                    "body": "  10.32am    My mistake. It\u2019s not Angus filing but Matt McIlraith. He\u2019s busy tapping that up as we speak but here\u2019s the report for now.  Thanks for joining me. As a Boks fan I\u2019ll be hoping for a cricket score in Durban. But if New Zealand do win this competition it would be a mighty turnaround after their crushing series loss to Ireland. Just shows you can never discount the All Blacks. Til next time. Dan      10.26am    Here\u2019s that Whitelock try. I\u2019m still not convinced it should have been given. What am I missing?      10.18am    More questions than answers      10.17am    New Zealand have one hand on the trophy after winning this one by 26 points. That means the Springboks have to beat the Pumas by at least 40 in Durban to lift the Rugby Championship. Hard to see that happening. The All Blacks dominated every metric. They had more of the ball and spent more time in Australia\u2019s territory. They beat 29 defenders to Australia\u2019s 11. They had twice as many clean breaks. They conceded less than half as many turnovers and made 92% of their tackles, compared to the 81% from Australia. This team might lack the consistency of earlier iterations but they are just as mighty when they get on the front foot. Whitelock was responsible for a lot of that as was Jordan who scored the opening try after turning on the after burners.  Jordie Barrett at 12 looks like a long term answer in the midfield and Savea back in the fold was impressive as well. For the Wallabies, they couldn\u2019t replicate their heroics last week. They were once again loose at the breakdown and coughed up two costly yellow cards, their seventh and eighth of the competition. It\u2019s hard enough beating the All Blacks in Eden park with your full quota but it\u2019s near impossible a man down for 25% of the contest.  I\u2019ll stick around until Angus\u2019 match report comes in though I don\u2019t expect as much engagement as last week (prove me wrong, I\u2019d love to hear from you).  As always, it\u2019s been a pleasure (even if that wasn\u2019t the most thrilling of games).     10.09am    James Slipper:  Playing with 13 men put us on the back foot. That is a very disappointing outcome for us. We were really gutted with the result last week. We had a lot of confidence. But the ABs were too good. There is no excuse. far too many dropped balls and penalties. We had a bit of adversity through the Championship. I\u2019m proud of the boys but gutted with the way we performed tonight. It just wasn\u2019t good enough.      10.07am    Sam Whitelock:  Eden park is an amazing place to play. Thanks for everyone coming out.  Really really happy with the defence. That comes down to effort. There are always things to work on. I thought Australia put pressure on us early on.  I wish the Black Ferns all the best      10.05am   TRY! New Zealand 40-14 Australia (Petaia, 80)  It\u2019s taken the Wallabies 80 minutes to string together a cohesive move and, wouldn\u2019t you know it, they\u2019ve scored a try. A line-out on the right went all the way left. Koroibete wins a collision and it\u2019s recycled quickly. Short passes from White eventually opens the space for Pataia to burst through and dot down under the poles. The extras are added, but it\u2019s mere consolation. Australia were third best in a two horse race.      10.02am    80 mins: A penalty for Australia after New Zealand hold on the tackler. The ball is kicked into touch close to the line. Australia have missed 26 tackles. You don\u2019t win rugby games with those numbers. Still. One more chance for a consolation.      9.59am   Penalty! New Zealand 40-7 Australia (Mo'unga, 77)  Right through the middle from Mo\u2019unga. New Zealand\u2019s dominance on the floor has been telling. And that\u2019s Whitelock winning another penalty for his team.     9.56am    74 mins: Australia win the line-out and get Valentini, who has been very quiet tonight, on the ball. It goes right but Reece rips it loose close to his own line. New Zealand don\u2019t kick and send it left where there is an overlap. Clarke isolates Wright and RUNS OVER HIM! Crunching collision. That\u2019ll be a gif by now.  New Zealand charge up field and then lose it. Australia have it back and punt it out. All Blacks ball just inside Wallaby territory.     9.53am    71 mins: Penalty for the Wallabies in their own area. That\u2019s the 24th for the match. There\u2019s a massive hit on Hodge by Sevu Reece.  Another penalty a minute later. This time for Whitelock not staying on his feet. We\u2019re crawling to the inevitable close. If you\u2019re a Springboks fan you\u2019ll be hoping for another Wallaby try. They have a line-out inside All Blacks territory.      9.50am    69 mins: Great work from White who isolates his opposite number, Christie, at the base of the New Zealand scrum, wraps him up and forces the turnover over penalty after the Kiwi 9 refused to let go of the ball.   Updated at 9.57am BST    9.49am    68 mins: It\u2019s a scrum for New Zealand 5m out close to the right touchline after Koroibete knocks on in his own goal area. It was a second attempt to ground the ball after a New Zealand kick went too long. The Aussie winger missed his first effort and then knocked on from his second. Getting really messy for the visitors. New Zealand looking to rub their noses in it.  Will Jordan leaves the field with a limp. Hope he\u2019s OK. He had a tremendous night.     9.46am   TRY! New Zealand 37-7 Australia (Taukei'aho, 65)  Another driving maul, another try for New Zealand. They deserve that. They\u2019ve been better in every facet of the game tonight and their maul has been mighty throughout. They\u2019ve been gifted the opportunity from Australian sloppiness but they\u2019ve made the most of it. Clean ball to Whitelock, who has been immense, means the replacement hooker Taukei\u2019aho just has to join his mates for the shove. A few backs get involved as it rumbles over. Mo\u2019unga misses the kick but it\u2019s a 30 point lead for the home side.  Updated at 9.47am BST    9.43am    63 mins: No they can\u2019t! They maul but the Australian pack holds them up well and win the ball back. An interesting graphic has just come up. They\u2019ve scored more points in the final quarter than they have at any other stage in this year\u2019s Championship. Not that it matters when you drop the ball on your own try line. A terrible mistake. Then they stray off side and concede a penalty. What a shambles from the Aussies.   Updated at 9.56am BST    9.41am    62 mins: Australia really are their own worst enemies. After scoring a try they find some space in their own territory but make a pig\u2019s ear of it. A New Zealand scrum ends in a New Zealand penalty which becomes a New Zealand line-out. Can they maul another try?     9.40am   TRY! New Zealand 32-5 Australia (Fainga'a, 59)  A try from nothing. Not that Australia will care about that. A New Zealand clearing kick was partially charged down and squirted towards the 22m line. Australia recycle and a quick pass goes right. The ball pops up and the replacement hooker Fainga\u2019a shovels it on for Samu on the touchline. The flanker stands up in the tackle and plays a hopeful offload back inside. That\u2019s tipped back by a Kiwi hand and Fainga\u2019a gathers and dives for the line, reaching it with a stretch. Foley kicks the conversion.     9.37am    57 mins: Aussies have a line-out within driving distance of the try line after winning a penalty. Can they make it count? The maul forms but splinters at the back. Retallick gets himself in the way and turns it! Brilliant from the All Black lock. White can\u2019t free the ball out the back and that\u2019s a big opportunity missed by the Wallabies.     9.34am   TRY! New Zealand 32-0 Australia (Taylor, 54)  Emphatic from New Zealand. Whitelock brings down Taylor\u2019s line-out and the maul forms. It\u2019s perfect. Compact and immovable, they get the legs driving and it\u2019s only ending one way. Taylor falls over the line and comes up with the ball. That\u2019s New Zealand\u2019s fourth. Unless South Africa put on a cricket score against Argentina in Durban the Rugby Championship trophy will reside in New Zealand. Mo\u2019unga can\u2019t convert but that is a monstrous advantage for the home side.   Updated at 9.55am BST    9.31am    50 mins: It\u2019s a penalty for New Zealand inside Aussie territory on the left but what a bizarre passage of play. It started with an All Black scrum that went to Jordie Barrett in the midfield. He\u2019s had a strong game and that\u2019s another strong carry. Clarke out wide and then Jordan wriggled the extra space but Australia get their hands on the ball. White sends a looping pass wide when kicking might have been the better option. It\u2019s tipped back by New Zealand and then tipped back again by Australia. The ball bounces around AFL style until a penalty is called in favour of New Zealand. They nudge it in the corner, lose the ball, it\u2019s an Australia scrum, New Zealand win a penalty and they have it back. Another line-out 5m out.      9.28am    50 mins: A raft of changes for Australia including Nic White. Love him or hate him, his introduction last week turned the tide.  Updated at 9.28am BST    9.26am   Penalty! New Zealand 27-0 Australia (Mo'unga, 47)  Australia look like a beaten team now. New Zealand just keep coming at them. Jordan involved with Clarke creating space in the midfield, driving with his powerful legs, getting his team on the front foot. The pressure proves too much and Australia cough up a penalty in front of the sticks which are easily bisected by Mo\u2019unga.     9.23am   TRY! New Zealand 24-0 Australia (Whitelock, 43)  WOW! I\u2019m honestly not sure how that\u2019s been given. Watching the replays I felt for sure that Whitelock had lost control of the ball but not according to the men that matter. The on-field decision was a try and a try it remains. From the scrum Jordie Barrett at first receiver burst through a half gap. It went to the blindside where Jordan (man of the match so far) jinked and danced through some space to take it close. The ball went back in field where Whitelock took it on and hauled it over the line. Australians swarmed to tackle but couldn\u2019t prevent the score. Mo\u2019unga\u2019s additional two points means its a long way back now for the Aussies.   Updated at 9.35am BST    9.18am    43 mins: On field decision is a try! I thought Whitelock was held up but Brace is going upstairs\u2026     9.17am    42 mins: After a bit of \u2018after-yous\u2019 Porecki, back on the field, throws a skew line-out. All Blacks scrum on Aussie 22.      9.15am    Back under way. Australia need another miracle comeback. Can New Zealand stretch their lead and get one hand on the Rugby Championship trophy? Big 40 minutes coming up.     9.13am    This is heat!      9.09am    \u201cMorning Daniel\u201d Hi James Cavell. Hope you\u2019re well. \u201cMaybe I couldn\u2019t hear it properly, or just couldn\u2019t believe my ears, but when Andrew Brace called an offside penalty against James Slipper and asked the TMO to check the tackle, did the TMO tell him that Slipper had actually been onside? As well as that the tackle was fine? As I heard things Brace overruled the TMO correcting an offside call that he had already blown, leading to a penalty from which he then awarded NZ a penalty try.  Might this be controversial? Especially after last week?\u201d It was a bit strange. The offside question at least. I felt for sure he\u2019d turn that around. I guess after he stopped play he felt compelled to stick with his on-field decision? Not sure. Looks like we\u2019ll be talking about the ref once again after the final whistle.     9.04am   HALF TIME: New Zealand 17-0 Australia  If you\u2019re just tuning in you\u2019d assume that it\u2019s been one way traffic. You\u2019d be right, sort of, but not entirely. It could equally be a lot worse for the Wallabies but they could have scored a few themselves. Two yellow cards for the men in yellow has hampered their progress. Jordan\u2019s pace, which was blistering out on the right, accounted for the first try and a penalty try for a cynical drag down in the maul meant that a big gap opened up. But Samu in particular, and the Wallabies in general have clung on and won important turnover penalties with New Zealand sniffing their try line. Koroibete should have pulled one back for Australia after quick hands found him in space in a tight channel on the left, but his boot was already on the touchline when he received the final pass. It\u2019s been a ding dong battle. Up and down. Round and round. They\u2019re hammering each other. Another quality game between these two good frenemies. Catch you in a bit.   Updated at 9.31am BST    8.59am    39 mins: Ding! Dong! Up and down we go. New Zealand have down the left but the Australia get their paws on the pill through an intercept on the touchline. Foley (I think) runs out of space so dinks it up field and Beauden mops up. He\u2019s so calm under pressure, waits for it to calm down before picking it up and hoofing it back where it came from. But it doesn\u2019t go out and Rieko Ioane gives chase. Kalloway has to do some tidying himself and does well to find room to kick. And breathe.     8.56am    37 mins: Take a bow Samu! He\u2019s just won a penalty on the ground 5m from his own line. New Zealand through Jordan and then Smith attack from deep and get within touching distance of another try but Samu stands up, isolates the runner and stays on his feet to win a pen. Australia are hanging on. They\u2019re a long way behind but it could be a lot worse.      8.54am    36 mins: Australia have to chase the game so they understandably tap and go. They\u2019re turned over and New Zealand have it with their heels on their own line. A side step from Retallick opens space and an wonderful off-load in the tackle from Lomax (who is having a top game) opens space for Beauden to make a clearing kick. Australia gather but New Zealand almost turn them. They don\u2019t though but get it back and charge bacl up field. Back and forth. These two don\u2019t do boring.   Updated at 9.27am BST    8.51am    33 mins: What a hit, son! Wilson gets the ball deep in his own territory and runs with all the force of a runaway rhino. He pins his ears back and throws himself into a black wall. He\u2019s stopped, but the collision is a mighty one. Australia win a penalty on the halfway line and kick it into touch. Their line out has worked tonight so they\u2019ll back themselves. This one also works. Clean ball and they go and win another penalty in front of the poles. Brace gives a lecture to Smith for mouthing off. What is it with scrumhalves? Australia tap and go\u2026.      8.48am         8.48am    30 mins: NO TRY! Koroibete has stepped on the touch line within touching distance of try line. A busting charge from Samu takes the ball close and quick hands from the base of a ruck sends it left where the winger is waiting. But his boot is on the whitewash before he dives over so no try. They have the advantage and tap and go again. The ball is held up and New Zealand can drop out. Australia needed to score there.     8.44am   PENALTY TRY! New Zealand 17-0 Australia  And it\u2019s a yellow card for Porecki. The entire Wallaby pack dragged the driving maul down but someone had to go so to the sin bin so it\u2019s the hooker. Big trouble now for Australia as New Zealand are rightly rewarded for their dominance. That shove was only going one way.     8.42am    27 mins: Australia had the ball in New Zealand territory but they were swiftly on the back foot after a counter attack that began with Beauden Barrett who passed to Clarke. The Kiwi winger exploded up field, jinked past one and had Jordan on his right. Pass and it\u2019s surely a try. Inexplicably he goes back in field so New Zealand recycle. Retallick picks and goes and momentum is with New Zealand. The game is held up as the referee Brace blows for an off side. That\u2019s Slipper who has strayed. Brace considers a card but keeps them in his pocket. AB line-out 5m out.     8.38am   TRY! New Zealand 10-0 Australia (Jordan, 24)  Scintillating from Will Jordan. He\u2019s absolutely skinned the replacement Petaia on the outside by putting on the after burners. The ball came from way out left and wormed it\u2019s way right. New Zealand got front foot ball from a charging run from Rieko Ioane but there was still loads to do by the time it make it to Jordan. There appeared to be little on but that was enough for the man with jet fuel in his boots. Pure pace. Mo\u2019unga with the extras opens up a double digit lead.   Updated at 9.14am BST    8.34am   Penalty! New Zealand 3-0 Australia (Mo'unga, 21)  Really messy period ends with an All Blacks penalty 7m out from the poles. It started with an AB line-out on the right. Australia win it in the air but a wild pass infield from Porecki finds no one and New Zealand swarm and win it back. Lomax charges forward and brings it close to the line and a Wallaby strays off side. The ref tells Slipper his team is on a warning. Another penalty in the red zone and that will be a card. Mo\u2019unga kicks an easy shot at goal and opens the scoring.     8.31am    18 mins: New Zealand\u2019s defence is water tight. Australia charge it up off the back of another clean line-out. Foketi and Alaalatoa involved but Foley runs out of room and stabs a nothing grubber out.  New Zealand keep the ball from their line out and eventually win a penalty after over exuberance from the Wallabies on the ground. All Blacks line-out 10m into Aussie territory.     8.27am    16 mins: Ah, it\u2019s a knock on by the Wallabies inside New Zealand\u2019s 22. A better line-out on the right gives them quick ball. They keep it tight but recycle quickly. Swift passing around the fringe opens a gap but the man through the hole (didn\u2019t quite see who that was) can\u2019t hold on to the short, stiff pass. All Blacks scrum in their own territory and Jordie Barrett hoofs it to the halfway line.     8.26am    14 mins: The Wallaby lin-out isn\u2019t clean but they win the ball. Several busting runs towards the line come to nothing as the AB\u2019s win the penalty. They tap and go, what a mad start to the game. Australia get it back and punt it forward with Koroibete countering. Jordan cleans up for the men in black and the clearing kick only goes as far as the 22. Australia will have the feed. Hectic opening.      8.23am    12 mins: Penalty to Australia 10m in All Black territory. Brilliant turnaround. The move started with a line-out on the right with Gordan putting up a high kick. Clarke fields it and New Zealand drive it up but once again Australia win the ball on the ground. They have the feed to the line-out 10m out from AB\u2019s line.      8.21am    10 mins: Another penalty in the red zone. Baffled there isn\u2019t a card. All Blacks go to the line-out instead. They\u2019ll regret that decision as the Aussies win a turnover penalty on the ground and now Foley has the chance to clear. Haha. He takes his time to kick and the crowd jeer him. Huge let off for the Wallabies.      8.19am    8 mins: Australia turn the scrum into a mess. Great shove. Savea loses control and it becomes scrappy. Clarke cleans up but it\u2019s an Australian knock-on in the tackle so New Zealand have the feed again. Still 5m out. Slightly closer to the poles.   Updated at 9.19am BST    8.18am    7 mins: The All Black scrum is too strong. Another penalty. They drive it close to the line but Savea is held up. They pack down again. Either a try or a card incoming. Australia need to get a back involved to stop this tide.     8.17am    5 mins: The extra body in the pack pays off for New Zealand and they shove Australia back and win a penalty. They go to the blindside and Ardie Savea gets his dancing shoes on. He passes inside and the ball is worked across the field where Beauden Barrett finds space and dinks a kick into Aussie territory. Koroibete cleans up but it\u2019s an AB scrum again 5m out.     8.14am    3 mins: A scrum inside NZ territory on the 10m line after a knock on. It\u2019s been a good start for the Wallabies but a solid platform now for the ABs with a man advantage. That\u2019s the 8th yellow for Australia in the Championship, more than any other team.  Updated at 8.15am BST    8.13am   YELLOW! Australia (Holloway, 2)  Nope, it\u2019s Holloway who is the guilty party. And he cops a yellow. That he dropped Papali\u2019i safely means he doesn\u2019t see red.      8.11am    1min: A barnstorming run from Holloway takes the ball into NZ\u2019s 22m but the clear-out is deemed illegal. There\u2019s a tip tackle (I think) from Porecki on Papali\u2019i. I think there\u2019s a card coming. Might be a red.     8.08am    AUSTRALIA DID THE BOOMERANG!   Updated at 9.21am BST    8.05am    The anthems are done. The smoke is clearing. And the haka is about to get underway. We\u2019re getting close.     7.58am    Ardie Savea is back! In my preamble rambles I forgot to mention that New Zealand\u2019s wrecking ball, for my money the most versatile loose forward in the game and a man who would walk onto any team sheet around the world, is back. Hope he goes well.     7.55am    The haka chat is gaining traction. This from a supporter across the ditch adds some perspective:      7.52am    This is from a South African rugby writer. Fans across the Indian Ocean will be watching this one closely. It\u2019s been a cracking Championship so far. How good would it be if the final game in Durban later today was the deciding contest?      7.48am    For those of you who like the other oval ball, I\u2019ve been told it\u2019s the AFL Grand Final. I must confess, I know nothing about that sport. It\u2019s like watching a swarm of bees pay homage to a Hieronymus Bosch painting. Still, if that\u2019s your vibe. Take a gander at the live blog while you wait for the real stuff to start:      7.39am    So much of the prematch chat has centred on the Haka. Last week, the Australian\u2019s lined up in a boomerang formation. Dave Rennie had this to say:  The All Blacks are laying down a challenge with the Haka aren\u2019t they? If you\u2019re a New Zealander, you face a Haka with a Haka. Most sides in world rugby don\u2019t have the luxury to be able to reply or respond that way. So the boomerang shape is unique to us. I\u2019ve worked with a kaumatua (respected Maori tribal elder) in New Zealand for a lot of years and it was his suggestion back in 2020 to form a boomerang shape. And the idea being that we throw the boomerang out when we start the Haka and it hovers above their head, mincing up their words and bringing their energy back to us. And the idea of advancing in the boomerang shape is to show we\u2019re up for the challenge. I think it\u2019s an incredibly respectful way of approaching the Haka and our boys have certainly embraced it.  Apparently a few All Blacks took issue with the formation after their decisive try last week and gave their Wallaby counterparts a mouthful. They said it was \u2018disrespectful\u2019. I\u2019m with Rennie on this one. In my column this week I wondered if we should put a cap on the Haka. If it provides the All Blacks (and other Pacific Island nations) an advantage, should they be restricted to performing it on home soil? Needless to say, a legendary All Black and even a 127-Test Springbok disagreed:   Updated at 7.40am BST    7.28am   Wallabies team news  Just the two changes for Dave Rennie\u2019s side with Harry Wilson starting at No 8 and the fit again Caderyn Neville moving to the second row. Bernard Foley continues at flyhalf after making a remarkable comeback to Test rugby while Rob Valentini, one of the form players in the game at present, starting at blindside flank.      7.20am   All Blacks team news  There\u2019s a change at hooker with the double-try scorer Samisoni Taukei\u2019aho making way for Codie Taylor. Sam Whitelock skippers the side in place of the injured Sam Cane with Beauden Barrett starting at fullback. Expect some bombs from his boots. His brother Jordie slots in at inside centre. Will be fascinating to see how he gets on in midfield.      7.05am   Preamble  Good morning, good afternoon, welcome to the live coverage of of the sixth and final round of the Rugby Championship from Eden Park, Auckland. Kick off is at 7:05pm NZST/5:05pm AEST/8:05am BST. Last week was nuts. The match itself was bonkers, dominated by a refereeing decision that prompted Rugby Australia to write a formal letter of complaint to World Rugby. It\u2019s a shame that has been the main talking point as Australia roared back from a gargantuan deficit and almost pulled off one of the more remarkable comebacks in their history. New Zealand, though, did what they always seem to do and scored when it mattered to clinch it at the death. A team condemned as one of the worst in All Blacks history is now just one more victory from securing the tightest Rugby Championship in memory. History is with the men in black. Australia last won here in 1986 which was the last time New Zealand tasted defeat at their impenetrable fortress. The Championship may be over for the Wallabies but they\u2019ll have revenge on their mind. It promises to be a cracker and I genuinely can\u2019t wait. My name is Dan/Daniel/whatever you prefer. I\u2019ll be keeping you company as we build up towards kick-off. Do drop me an email or say hi on Twitter. I do my best to reply to every message but I read every word and appreciate them all. I\u2019m off to make a strong coffee. In the meantime, sink your teeth into Angus\u2019 preview:   "

                    "body": "Gareth Taylor expects Manchester City\u2019s Women\u2019s FA Cup final against Chelsea at Wembley on Sunday to be a slugfest and is clear that even if his team fail to win their season has been a success.\nCity go into the game in sparkling form, having won 13 games in a row, a sequence that includes beating Emma Hayes\u2019s side 3-1 in the League Cup final, the second trophy of Taylor\u2019s three-year tenure after he guided his side to the 2020 FA Cup.\n\nVictory against Reading on the final day of the Women\u2019s Super League campaign secured Champions League qualification for City and they face a Chelsea team who are the FA Cup holders and WSL champions. Taylor is relishing Sunday\u2019s showpiece.\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be fantastic \u2013 it is two good teams going at it, slugging it out, two teams who have shown really good quality this season,\u201d the manager said. \u201cIt\u2019s great for fans of both teams to see their teams going at it; hopefully for the neutral as well it will be an exciting game. We hope to see some good football played, some good talent on display and worthy victors at the end.\n\u201cOf course it\u2019s massive [to beat Chelsea]. We want to do it, there\u2019s no doubt about that. But there\u2019s a really healthy respect between the clubs, a healthy respect between the players, between myself and Emma, the two organisations. Why wouldn\u2019t we commend what they\u2019ve done? Emma\u2019s been there a long time [10 years], she\u2019s been supported, she\u2019s won trophies, got to finals, she\u2019s done amazingly well.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been there before in cup finals and so have Chelsea, so there\u2019s no real edge for either team. It\u2019s just who goes out and performs best.\u201d\nCity\u2019s closing phase of the campaign came after a start that featured four losses from the opening seven games. Taylor received criticism despite his squad being seriously hampered by injuries, the nadir a 5-0 loss at Arsenal in the league for which 10 players were unavailable.\n\u201cUnfortunately there is a lot of criticism out there \u2013 hopefully people have seen how we turned it around,\u201d he said. \u201cI was a player for more than 20 years; we do struggle to say: \u2018Well done.\u2019 Unfortunately we can all highlight the negative stuff. But even when we were missing huge personalities and players, what we were doing wasn\u2019t a million miles off.\u201d\n\nSam Kerr scored twice in Chelsea\u2019s 3-0 win over Arsenal in December\u2019s Covid-delayed 2021 final. The Australian forward did the same in the final-day 4-2 victory over Manchester United that clinched the title, further underlining the threat she poses.\n\u201cSam is a very good player but if we concentrate too much on her then we may neglect other very good players that Chelsea have,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cShe was very gracious in defeat [after the League Cup final] \u2013 the way she handled herself was spectacular.\u201d\nTaylor will enjoy a good breakfast on Cup final day. \u201cIf you had asked me what I would have when I was a player I would have told you something to do with superstition but as I got to the end of my career I realised it was nonsense \u2013 it didn\u2019t work,\u201d he said. \u201cSo on Sunday if I see some nice pancakes on the side at the hotel they are making the day.\u201d\n\nEven if City do not lift the cup Taylor wants his players to have pride. \u201cWe want to win another trophy,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s one we\u2019ve been successful in previously but whatever happens on Sunday, we\u2019re proud of the season and we\u2019re moving in the right direction.\u201d\nDemi Stokes is in contention again after a family issue and Jess Park is available after being injured since early last month."

                    "body": "If one battle more than any other has defined the brutality of Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine, it is the three-month siege of Mariupol\u2019s steelworks this spring, and the harrowing experience of its last defenders. Holed up in Azovstal, one of Europe\u2019s largest metal-producing plants, hundreds of outnumbered, outgunned, wounded and emaciated Ukrainian soldiers, and more than 1,000 civilians, resisted one of Moscow\u2019s fiercest military attacks for more than 80 days. \u201cNo one came out of there unchanged,\u201d says Oksana, an Azovstal employee who asked not to give her full name. \u201cThey were one person when they went in, and another person when they came out.\u201d Soon after the Russian invasion \u2013 in late February \u2013 Mariupol was one of the first major cities to be encircled. Viewed as a key Kremlin objective, the city was the scene of a siege that the Red Cross has defined as \u201capocalyptic\u201d. The outskirts of the city became the site of a mass grave, and the bodies of many more men, women and children were either dumped in the streets or remain buried beneath the rubble.  Ukrainian authorities estimate that 22,000 people died during the fighting. Some survivors took refuge in the Azovstal steelworks, an industrial site covering an area of about four square miles, including a network of underground tunnels. With the civilians were about 3,000 soldiers, many of whom were members of the notorious Azov brigade, which, at its inception in 2014, included far-right volunteers, some with neo-Nazi affiliations. In recent years the brigade has been fully integrated into the Ukrainian military, but for President Vladimir Putin it was the perfect propaganda opportunity to convince the public that his narrative about the \u201cnazification\u201d of Ukraine was true, and that his army would hunt them down like rats. Never would Putin have imagined that the last defenders of Mariupol would defy his plan for so long. Cut off from the world and low on food, the defenders of Azovstal were holed up in the tunnels of the steelworks for over two months while the Russians launched rockets and incendiary bombs at the site. By mid-May, their fate had become uncertain. The only evidence of survivors came at the end of the siege, when, before his capture, photographer Dmytro Kozatskyi, an Azov Regiment fighter, released his images of the siege on social media. The extraordinary photos show bearded soldiers, many wounded, some with missing limbs. While the civilians were evacuated, the Ukrainian soldiers were sent to a penal colony in Olenivka, in Donetsk. The Kremlin foreshadowed their death sentence. But then, in September, Kyiv confirmed that the commander of the Azov Battalion, Lt Colonel Denys Prokopenko, was among 215 Ukrainian prisoners of war released in a prisoner swap, the largest such exchange since the start of the war. In return, Russia received 55 prisoners from Ukraine, including the country\u2019s most valuable Russian prisoner, Viktor Medvedchuk, the former Ukrainian MP and an ally of Putin, accused by Ukraine of high treason. Ukraine\u2019s agreements with Russia stipulated that the released leaders of the Azov Regiment would remain until the end of the war in Turkey, which played a role in the exchange. Some, however, were able to leave the country, including Kozatskyi, who is thought to be in the US. Contacting them has been practically impossible, however, because of the security measures put in place by the Ukrainian government to protect the soldiers given their precarious physical and psychological condition.  In a rare public interview, another ex-prisoner, Mykhailo Dianov, photographed with a bandage on his broken right arm and weighing 40kg less after his detention in the Russian-controlled penal colony, told Sky News he thought he would never survive: \u201cWe thought this every day. At Azovstal we thought it was the end. \u201cAfter a month of starvation, when you close your eyes, you forget about your family, everything. The only thing you think about is food.\u201d Talking about the months of captivity, Dianov said: \u201cThey treated us like animals. It was impossible to eat.\u201d Dianov has reportedly also travelled to the US, where he will undergo a long convalescence after surgery on his arm. Before the war, he was a pianist; his dream is to play again. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has promised that \u201call Mariupol defenders will be taken home\u201d, but it is unclear how many of them remain captives of the Russians. Local media estimates that about 1,000 Azov soldiers are still prisoners of war. And, according to Ukrainian officials, the bodies of an unknown number of soldiers remain buried under the rubble of Azovstal."

                    "body": "All the best rugby teams are striving for the same things. An identity. A tight-knit culture. An environment in which words, eventually, are superfluous. Where what really matters is not individual ability but the unbreakable bond of togetherness. And where, after a while, winning becomes so natural it feels almost preordained.\nUntil, that is, the magic dries up. Star players retire or get injured, coaches come and go, supporters grow restless. Worse still, the arch rivals up the road are flying. History, all of a sudden, counts for little. Which is roughly where Munster, once the European Cup\u2019s ultimate feelgood story and guardians of what used to be the continent\u2019s most fabled culture, currently find themselves.\n\nAhead of their two-legged Champions Cup last-16 collision with Exeter Chiefs, the mind spools back to the great Paul O\u2019Connell\u2019s description of the Munster dressing-room in his aptly-titled autobiography, The Battle. \u201cIt was like having the craic in the pub with eight pints on board, except you\u2019re stone cold sober. If a guy broke up with his girlfriend and was really cut up about it, we\u2019d play \u2018It\u2019ll be Lonely this Christmas\u2019 at full volume in the gym. When Marcus Horan found out he had a heart condition \u2026 we decided he needed to hear Feargal Sharkey singing \u2018A good heart these days is hard to find.\u2019\u201d\nAnd so on. Towards the end of O\u2019Connell\u2019s playing career, the running \u201cjoke\u201d was that he was visiting a local hospice each day after training to familiarise himself with the place. Brutal did not begin to cover it, which was one of the reasons why Munster were so relentlessly tough in adversity on the field.\nAnd now? The \u201cBrave and the Faithful\u201d who followed their local heroes everywhere in the halcyon days are having their faith severely tested. It is more than a decade since the men in red last won any silverware, since when Leinster have accelerated away over the horizon as Ireland\u2019s most irresistible force.\nLast weekend, in the keynote fixture of their United Rugby Championship campaign, Munster\u2019s blue-shirted nemesis cruised down to Limerick with some big name starters missing and still won 34-19. There were empty seats at Thomond Park, not all of which could be blamed on Covid-19 or the late kick-off. Injuries are also stacking up, with key men such as Peter O\u2019Mahony, Tadhg Beirne, Joey Carbery, Dave Kilcoyne and Gavin Coombes all unavailable to play this weekend. Worst of all, there is still a vacuum where the clear-sighted plan for next season - and beyond - should be.\n\nMunster\u2019s South African head coach Johann van Graan is off to Bath at the end of the season, as is his defence coach JP Ferreira. The club\u2019s senior coach, the ex-Wallaby fly-half Stephen Larkham, is also departing along with the Springbok World Cup winner Damian de Allende. Even the ever-loyal O\u2019Mahony pointedly observed this week that the delay in naming Van Graan\u2019s replacement was \u201cnot ideal\u201d from a playing perspective. The popular Graham Rowntree, currently coaching the forwards, has applied for the role but nothing is yet confirmed.\nFor those who live and breathe Munster it is all increasingly frustrating. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of discontent here with the way the province is being run,\u201d says Donal Lenihan, the highly respected ex-Munster and Ireland captain who is now serving as president of Cork Constitution. Lenihan even uses the word \u201cdelusional\u201d in relation to the current organisation.\n\u201cIt drives me bananas,\u201d he tells the Guardian, urging Munster\u2019s senior officials to get real and make significant structural changes if they wish to move forward. \u201cMunster think they\u2019re Leinster, that\u2019s their biggest bloody problem. I chuckle a bit when we travel to France and England. It\u2019s like Manchester United in many ways. They\u2019re seen as being these giants but they\u2019re not.\u201d\n\nThere are also distant echoes of Bath and Leicester, two English sides who have spent the past decade chasing former glories. Even the now-resurgent Tigers finally had to accept that their time-honoured methods needed updating. Munster\u2019s issues, though, are arguably more deep-seated. Big lads in Limerick, who would have gravitated to rugby 10-15 years ago, are now choosing hurling instead and the province is struggling to compete with the population advantages, private school nurseries and well-organised feeder systems that Leinster are now harnessing.\nIn Lenihan\u2019s opinion - \u201cThey\u2019re in a different class off the field as well as on it and that\u2019s coming home to roost\u201d - there is no point in denying the existence of a gulf. Munster, he believes, need to front up to the challenge, install a more long-term focused director of rugby and re-engage more proactively with their local clubs. Embracing a more upbeat playing style would also help. Another former Munster legend, Keith Wood, recently dismissed their limited gameplan as \u201cturgid nonsense\u201d and some Cork-based fans are opting against making the three-hour round trip to Limerick.\nIt is hardly an endorsement of the tactical and selectorial instincts of Van Graan, who took over from Rassie Erasmus in 2017. \u201cI think the thing that\u2019s annoying people most in Munster is that they\u2019ve got a decent squad of players,\u201d says Lenihan. \u201cFrom a coaching perspective they should be getting more out of what they have. We\u2019re not going to win the Heineken Cup this year and we won\u2019t win the URC either. They should be investing in the younger lads.\u201d\n\nWith so much angst swirling around, it does not feel entirely coincidental that Ronan O\u2019Gara and Jerry Flannery, two upwardly-mobile coaches reared in Munster\u2019s unforgiving crucible, have conspicuously chosen to stay put at La Rochelle and Harlequins respectively. There is also a financial aspect to consider. With the rebuilt Thomond Park and the pandemic having already emptied Munster\u2019s coffers, lobbing huge sums at the world\u2019s best coaches is no longer part of the equation.\nIf the right catalyst can be identified, Lenihan still believes a rousing revival is possible. \u201cI think the culture is still there but it\u2019s dormant. It won\u2019t take much to reignite it.\u201d Maybe, but finishing second over two legs to opponents who have endured a mixed Premiership season would scarcely dilute the sense of a proud province treading water. It makes the next two Saturdays significant on several fronts. Stand Up And Fight? If ever there was a moment to resurrect some of that old Munster magic it is now."

                    "body": "Suvendra Mary has not changed her clothes, nor has she had a decent meal in five days. Last week, she and six other women boarded a bus from their home town, Badulla, about 350km from Colombo, and arrived at the department of immigration and emigration in hope of applying for their passports. Since then, the women have been sitting in a queue of at least a thousand others dreaming of leaving Sri Lanka. Mary is hoping to find work as a housemaid in Saudi Arabia. Her only goal is to send money home to her family who are feeling the brunt of the worst economic meltdown to hit the country since it gained independence from the British in 1948. The seriousness of the situation was laid bare by prime minister Ranil Wickremesinghe on Wednesday when he told parliament that after months of shortages \u201cour economy has completely collapsed\u201d.  \u201cI thought we will be able to get our passports in a day but now we are staying in this queue for several days,\u201d said Mary, 41. \u201cWhen it rains, we sit under umbrellas. When it is too sunny, we sit under umbrellas. We don\u2019t leave our spot. If we leave someone else will take it.\u201d These days, people staying in queues for days to purchase fuel and cooking gas is a common sight. Headline inflation year-on-year shot up to 45.3% by May this year. The Sri Lankan government is struggling to find sufficient foreign currency to import essential goods, while protests continue across the island demanding President Gotabaya Rajapaksa resign.  A team from the International Monetary Fund is on the island to negotiate a bailout. But for people like Mary, leaving seems to be the only option to beat poverty. According to government statistics more than 329,000 people have applied for passports from January to 15 June this year. Last year 382,504 passports were issued and in 2020 the number was 207,692. Chinthaka Pushpakumara, a 39-year-old father and housekeeping supervisor from Polonnaruwa, situated about 227km from Colombo, said he wanted to leave so his three children would have a better future. But he was worried about leaving them behind. \u201cIt was not an easy decision to make. My youngest is only one and a half years old. I must stay strong, if not my family will suffer,\u201d Pushpakumara said. He is not the only tourism industry worker to leave Sri Lanka, which relies heavily on tourism income. Sanath Ukwatte, the former president of the Hotel Association of Sri Lanka, said the industry had lost about 15,000 professionals. \u201cThere is more to leave. We [hotel owners] are very worried, but we can\u2019t force them to stay. We are facing a challenging period right now,\u201d he said. Most of the tourism industry professionals are seeking work in the Maldives, as well as Dubai, Qatar, or elsewhere in the Middle East.  Sri Lankans seeking overseas work are mostly semi-skilled workers such as plumbers, drivers and mechanics. The government this year has already sent 138,460 registered workers abroad compared with 122,321 last year. Many more have left unregistered. Manusha Nanayakkara, minister of labour and foreign employment, said Sri Lankans going overseas for work was a good thing as the country needed foreign remittances. He said shops and other small-scale businesses were closing, pushing many out of jobs. On 20 June the cabinet of ministers passed a proposal to bring down the legal age of women working as housemaids abroad from 25 years of age to 21, to encourage all migrant workers to register with the government. However, leaving home is not always an easy decision. A video shared on social media recently is engraved in Pushpakumara\u2019s mind. \u201cIt was a video of a little child calling his father when he was leaving for work. I couldn\u2019t watch the video till the end. I switched my phone off. I know I must stay strong.\u201d"

                    "body": "Finn Russell believes the jeopardy of relegation in the Top 14 is a key factor behind the success of the French clubs in the Champions Cup with Racing 92 one of three to reach the last four, which features no Premiership teams for the second year running.\nRussell scored a remarkable try in Racing\u2019s victory over Sale last Sunday to ensure a rematch of last season\u2019s semi-final against La Rochelle, on Sunday, while Leinster host Toulouse, the defending champions, in the other tie on Saturday. Sale\u2019s defeat leaves no English clubs in the reckoning in a tournament that was won by a Premiership side for four of the five seasons before the current lean spell began.\n\nRacing\u2019s side featured Russell, Teddy Thomas and Juan Imhoff while they were able to call on Virimi Vakatawa and the World Cup-winning prop Trevor Nyakane from the bench in a show of their strength in depth. While the salary cap in France has recently been reduced, it sits at around \u20ac10m (\u00a38.5m), significantly more than the Premiership, which has been trimmed to \u00a35m. Furthermore, there will be dispensation for one marquee player to sit outside the cap, rather than two, from next season.\nThat has led to a number of high-profile players leaving the Premiership \u2013 Sale are losing the World Cup winners Faf de Klerk and Lood de Jager \u2013 and though the fact there is no relegation for this season, the next and possibly longer dilutes the need for such star power on a domestic front, it could be hurting the Premiership\u2019s chances in Europe.\n\u201cThe number of players we have here in France and the recruitment we do, that helps a lot,\u201d said Russell. \u201cIn the Premiership just now, there\u2019s no relegation. Over here, teams are scrapping to stay out of that relegation battle \u2013 scrapping to stay up, or get into the Champions Cup.\n\n\u201cThere are never any easy games. Every game, you have to play your best to win. This year, we\u2019ve lost to Biarritz and Perpignan, who are at the bottom of the league. We lost to both of them away from home.\n\u201cThat just shows that whether teams are high up or low down, every game is a massive game. Every week you are playing in a must-win game because if you drop two points, it puts you in a tough position. That\u2019s the great thing for us.\n\u201cI don\u2019t really keep an eye on how the league is going in England. I just know that, over here, where there is relegation, teams are scrapping at the bottom because they want to stay in the Top 14. Whether they are at home or away, it makes games so much harder because teams are scrapping away to stay in the Top 14.\u201d\n\nRussell also believes the success of the Top 14 sides on the continent goes hand in hand with the fortunes of the France national side, who clinched a first Six Nations grand slam in 12 years in March. \u201cIn general, French rugby is getting much better and it\u2019s a country that loves rugby so with the clubs and the national team doing that, it gets more and more people into rugby.\n\u201cIt\u2019s different \u2013 the Top 14 compared to the Premiership or the URC. The style of rugby changes from team to team, but also from competition to competition. In the Top 14 there\u2019s physicality, there\u2019s flair, there\u2019s strategy; there\u2019s everything you want here.\u201d"

We will remain in close contact and continue to coordinate with our Nato allies.\u201d\n\n\nSunak added that he spoke with the foreign secretary and defence secretary. \n\u201cWe are urgently looking into reports of a missile strike in Poland and will support our allies as they establish what has happened. We are also coordinating with our international partners, including Nato,\u201d he said.\nA readout of the call issued by his Downing Street office also said that Duda had updated Sunak on the Polish investigation efforts, with Sunak offering \u201cany assistance needed to urgently establish what happened.\u201d\nUK foreign minister James Cleverly earlier said that the UK was urgently looking into the reports, adding they were in contact with Poland and Nato allies.\n\nUpdated at 1.05am GMT\n\n\n 12.22am  \nG7 leaders to have emergency summit after Poland explosion\n\nG7 leaders are arranging an emergency summit meeting on Wednesday in response to the explosion in Poland, the Kyodo news agency said, citing a Japanese government source.\nIt will take place in Bali in Indonesia, where the G20 summit is already under way.\nIt means the heads of government from the United States, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, and the United Kingdom will discuss the incident and possible consequences. All of them are members of Nato, apart from Japan.\nReuters has said that a Japan and United Kingdom meeting scheduled for the same day has been put on hold.\n\n\n\n 12.07am  \n\nHere\u2019s a tweet from US president Joe Biden, showing him on the phone to Poland\u2019s president Andrzej Duda. Biden is in Bali, Indonesia, for the G20 summit. He is sat with national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, and US secretary of state, Antony Blinken.\n\n\nUpdated at 12.11am GMT\n\n\n 12.06am  \n\nHere\u2019s a couple of photos from Przewod\u00f3w that have come through on news wires, as an investigation into the explosion begins.\n\n\n\n\n\n 11.57pm  \n\nPoland\u2019s president Andrzej Duda has said that the explosion in Przewod\u00f3w was a \u201cone-off incident\u201d and there are \u201cno indications\u201d that it is going to happen again.\nDuda said it was \u201cmost-likely\u201d a Russian-made rocket but \u201cwe do not have any conclusive evidence at the moment as to who launched this missile \u2026 this is all still under investigation at the moment.\u201d\nHe added it was likely Poland will active Nato\u2019s article 4 at a meeting of Nato on Wednesday.\nThis is from the Guardian\u2019s diplomatic editor, Patrick Wintour.\n\n\nUpdated at 11.58pm GMT\n\n\n 11.44pm  \nPoland's prime minister calls on Poles to 'remain calm'\n\nPoland\u2019s prime minister Mateusz Morawiecki has given a press conference where he has urged caution.\nSpeaking to reporters, Morawiecki said security forces and international experts were in Przewod\u00f3w, eastern Poland, where two people have been killed to try to determine the cause of the explosion.\nHe repeated several already-announced measures, including an increased military readiness and talking to Nato allies about an article 4 meeting between member states. Warsaw will also step up monitoring of its airspace.\nThe prime minister went on to ask for people to be restrained. \u201cI call on all Poles to remain calm around this tragedy. Let\u2019s be prudent, let\u2019s not let ourselves be manipulated.\n\u201cWe need to be ready to face fake news, propaganda efforts.\u201d\n\nUpdated at 11.47pm GMT\n\n\n 11.21pm  \n\nThis is an analysis from our world affairs editor, Julian Borger, on why the explosion is unlikely to trigger a military escalation between Nato and Russia.\nHe writes:\n\nEven if it was concluded that the missiles that crossed the Polish border were indeed Russian, and not Ukrainian anti-missile interceptors, it would fall short of an \u201carmed attack\u201d envisaged in article 5, argued William Alberque, director of strategy, technology and arms control for International Institute for Strategic Studies.\n\u201c\u2018Deliberate armed attack\u2019 is a real thing,\u201d Alberque said. \u201cTwo misfired cruise or ballistic missiles ain\u2019t it.\u201d\nUp to now, the broad Nato consensus has been that Russian escalation would lead to stepped-up arms supplies to Ukraine, and that \u2013 rather than any form of direct Nato involvement \u2013 would serve as a deterrent to Russian recklessness.\nThat is the most likely response this time, and there will be a debate within Nato on whether it warrants a step up in the sort of military assistance being provided. Ukraine\u2019s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, argued it warranted the provision of F-15 and F-16 fighter jets.\n\nYou can read his full piece here:\n\n\n\n\n 11.17pm  \nPoland says 'Russian-made missile' caused explosion\n\nThe Polish foreign ministry has said that a \u201cRussian-made missile\u201d was responsible for killing two people in the eastern village of Przewod\u00f3w on Tuesday afternoon.\nForeign affairs spokesperson Lukasz Jasina said: \u201cOn 15 November 2022, massive shelling of the entire territory of Ukraine and its critical infrastructure by the armed forces of the Russian Federation was observed for many hours.\n\u201cAt 15:40 in the village of Przewod\u00f3w \u2026 a Russian-made missile fell, killing two citizens of the republic of Poland.\u201d\nThe statement said that the Russian ambassador to Poland has also been summoned to give an explanation (see 11:10pm).\n\n\nUpdated at 11.41pm GMT\n\n\n 11.10pm  \n\nThe Polish foreign minister has summoned the Russian ambassador to Poland for an explanation of the events connected to the explosion in Przewod\u00f3w.\nIn a statement on Poland\u2019s government\u2019s website, a spokesperson said: \u201cThe minister of foreign affairs, Zbigniew Rau summoned the ambassador of the Russian federation to the ministry of foreign affairs and demanded immediate detailed explanations.\u201d\n\n\n\n 11.04pm  \n\nThe US president, Joe Biden, has offered Poland\u2019s leader, Andrzej Duda, the US\u2019s \u201cfull support for and assistance with Poland\u2019s investigation\u201d, Reuters reports.\nIn a telephone call, the Polish president gave Biden an update on the inquiry into the explosion that killed two people, and in turn Biden said the US had an \u201cironclad\u201d commitment to Nato.\nThe full readout provided by the White House said: \u201cPresident Joseph R. Biden, Jr. spoke with President Andrzej Duda of Poland and expressed deep condolences for the loss of life in Eastern Poland earlier this evening. \n\u201cPresident Duda described Poland\u2019s ongoing assessment of the explosion that took place in the eastern part of the country near the border with Ukraine. \n\u201cPresident Biden offered full U.S support for and assistance with Poland\u2019s investigation. President Biden reaffirmed the United States\u2019 ironclad commitment to Nato. \n\u201cThe two leaders said that they and their teams should remain in close touch to determine appropriate next steps as the investigation proceeds.\u201d\nThe US president has also spoken by phone to the Nato general secretary, Jens Stoltenberg.\nDuda has spoken to the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy. Zelenskiy tweeted afterwards: \u201cWe exchanged available information and are clarifying all the facts \u2026 all of Europe and the world must be fully protected from terrorist Russia.\u201d\n\nUpdated at 11.23pm GMT\n\n\n 10.45pm  \n\nUkrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said Russian missile attacks on Tuesday caused shutdowns in two of the country\u2019s nuclear power plants.\nIn an address to the nation, he said: \u201cAs a result of the strikes, several nuclear reactors at two plants were automatically disabled. These consequences were calculated, and the enemy knew exactly what it was doing.\u201d\nHe said that power has been restored to 8m homes after blackouts caused by the latest bombardment.\n\u201cAbout 10 million Ukrainians were disconnected after the terrorist attack. Supply to eight million consumers has already been restored. Power engineers and repairmen will work all night,\u201d he tweeted.\n\n\n\n 10.40pm  \n\nUK foreign secretary James Cleverley has said the government is \u201curgently\u201d looking into reports of missiles landing in Poland and is in contact with the government in Poland.\n\u201cWe are urgently looking into reports of missiles landing in Poland, and are in contact with our Polish friends and Nato allies,\u201d he said on Twitter.\n\n\n\n 10.38pm  \nSummary\n\nHere\u2019s what we know so far, as investigators look into an explosion in Przewod\u00f3w, a village near the border between Poland and Ukraine on Tuesday, which killed two people.\n\nStray missiles are feared to have exploded in Poland, killing two agricultural workers in a village near its eastern border.\nIt came as Russia launched a 100-missile attack on Ukraine, causing damage to infrastructure that left 7m homes without supplies. It has also had an impact on power supply in neighbouring Moldova.\nIt is unclear whether the explosion was directly caused by a missile fired by Russia, or whether it is as a result of a Ukrainian anti-missile defence system shooting down a Russian missile.\nThe Polish prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, held an emergency meeting of a government committee on national security and defence matters.\nGovernment spokesperson Piotr M\u00fcller said that Warsaw had raised its level of military readiness in the aftermath of the incident.\nM\u00fcller said the government was calling for a meeting to take place between Nato members. It would be possibly under article 4 of Nato\u2019s treaty, which says they \u201cwill consult together whenever, in the opinion of any of them, the territorial integrity, political independence or security of any of the Parties is threatened\u201d.\nRussia has denied any involvement. The defence ministry said in a statement: \u201cRussian firepower has launched no strikes at the area between Ukrainian-Polish border.\u201d\nKremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said he has \u201cno information\u201d about the situation in Poland.\nUkrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said it represents \u201ca very significant escalation\u201d.

It would mean Nato members would consult on further action.\nArticle 4 of the Nato treaty covers the scenario where a member state feels threatened by another country or a terrorist organisation.\nThe treaty clause says: \u201cThe parties will consult together whenever, in the opinion of any of them, the territorial integrity, political independence or security of any of the parties is threatened.\u201d\nThe 30 member states then start formal consultations at the request of the threatened member. The talks look at whether a threat exists and how to counter it, with decisions arrived at unanimously.\nArticle 4 does not, however, mean that there will be direct pressure to act.\nThis consultation mechanism has been triggered several times in Nato\u2019s history. One example is one year ago, when Turkish soldiers were killed in an attack from Syria.\nIn that case Nato decided to consult, but did not take any action.\n\nUpdated at 9.58pm GMT\n\n\n 9.32pm  \n\nUkraine\u2019s foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba has called for a Nato summit to stop Russian attacks, and has repeated a request for fighter jets to be sent to the country.\nHe tweeted: \u201cUkraine reaffirms its full solidarity with Poland and stands ready to provide any necessary support. Collective response to Russian actions must be tough and principled. \n\u201cAmong immediate actions: a Nato summit with Ukraine\u2019s participation to craft further joint actions which will force Russia to change its course on escalation, providing Ukraine with modern aircraft such as F-15 and F-16, as well as air defense systems, so that we can intercept any Russian missiles. Today, protecting Ukraine\u2019s skies means protecting Nato.\u201d\n\n\n\n 9.21pm  \n\nThe general secretary of Nato, Jens Stoltenberg has said he has spoken to the Polish president Andrzej Duda after the explosion earlier this evening.\nHe said that Nato is \u201cmonitoring the situation and allies are closely consulting\u201d.\n\u201cIt is important all facts are established,\u201d he added.\n\n\n\n\n 9.19pm  \nPoland raising readiness of military following explosion\n\nThe Polish government spokesperson Piotr Muller has just given a press conference in the capital Warsaw, where he said the government was raising the military\u2019s level of readiness in response to the explosion near its border with Ukraine.\nSpeaking to cameras, Muller confirmed that two people had been killed earlier on Tuesday. \nHe told reporters that the government was considering whether to trigger article 4, which would mean a meeting would take place of Nato members after their \u201cterritorial integrity, political independence or security\u201d has been threatened.\n\n\n\n 9.16pm  \nExplainer: what is Nato's article 5?\n\nThere is a lot of concern that the explosion in Poland may constitute a breach of Nato\u2019s article 5, if it\u2019s found that it is because of a Russian attack.\nFor those not well versed in Nato\u2019s founding treaty, article 5 is focused on collective defence and written at a time when the bloc was under threat from an attack by the former Soviet Union.\nNato\u2019s website describes it as\n\nCollective defence means that an attack against one ally is considered as an attack against all allies.\n\nArticle 5 has only ever been triggered once by Nato since it was signed in 1949, the day after the 11 September 2001 terror attacks on the World Trade Center buildings and Pentagon in the US.\nThere is no automatic trigger process for it. Nato would have to choose to enact it. There is no indication at the moment that this is likely, and Poland is still investigating the circumstances behind the explosion.\nJen Psaki, the White House press secretary during the first of Joe Biden\u2019s administrations, has tweeted this view while we wait for more information.\n\n\nUpdated at 9.42pm GMT\n\n\n 8.59pm  \n\nLatvia has announced it will convene an emergency meeting on Wednesday to assess the security situation, given reports of Russian missiles crossing into Poland. \nAlong with the announcement, Latvia\u2019s prime minister added that the meeting is \u201cto be ready for further action,\u201d reported Reuters. \n\n\n\n 8.51pm  \n\nGermany has said that it is monitoring reports that Russian rockets crossed into Poland, adding that it is in contact with Poland and other Nato members, reported Reuters. \nGerman foreign minister Annalena Baerbock posted to Twitter about the reports, writing: \n\n\n\n\n 8.48pm  \n\nHere is a full translation of Zelenskiy\u2019s remarks on Russian missiles reportedly crossing into Poland \n\nToday, what we we warned about long ago has happened. \nWe talked about it. \nTerror is not limited to our national borders.

Zelenskiy is calling for an international conference to \u201ccement key element of the postwar security architecture\u201d and prevent a recurrence of \u201cRussian aggression\u201d.\nKremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov has said that Zelenskiy\u2019s statement that there will be no \u201cMinsk-3\u201d deal to end the fighting in Ukraine confirms that Kyiv is not interested in holding peace talks with Moscow.\nIn Bali, Lavrov told the media that \u201call the problems are on the Ukrainian side, which categorically refuses any negotiations and puts forward conditions that are obviously unrealistic and inadequate in this situation\u201d.\nMykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to Zelenskiy, responded to Lavrov\u2019s remarks by blaming the continuation of the war on the Russian minister\u2019s \u201cpublic manipulation and unwillingness to stop murdering\u201d.\nLavrov also told reporters at the G20 summit in Bali on Tuesday that the United Nations had told him of written US and EU promises to remove obstacles to the export of Russian grain and fertilisers to world markets. Lavrov said he had received undertakings on this from the UN secretary general, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres.\nThe UN human rights office (OHCHR) said on Tuesday that both Russia and Ukraine have tortured prisoners of war during the nearly-nine-month conflict, citing examples including the use of electric shocks and forced nudity.\nMatilda Bogner, head of the monitoring mission, told a Geneva press briefing that the \u201cvast majority\u201d of Ukrainian prisoners they interviewed held by Russian forces reported torture and ill-treatment. She gave examples of dog attacks, electric shocks with Tasers and military phones and sexual violence.

He added:\n\nThere can only be one answer to that: that is continue, continue to support Ukraine, continue to send weapons, continue to humanitarian aid.

Notably, the opposition is criticising the government for its decision to involve Ireland in the European Union\u2019s combat training mission to train service personnel for the Ukrainian Armed Forces. This initiative was called another official step to draw Dublin into EU and subsequently Nato military activity that in the long run would completely demolish the idea of Ireland\u2019s traditional military neutrality.\nWe have to state that the right-centrist coalition now ruling Ireland is moving to virtually erode a constitutional ban on involving the state in military conflicts. Ireland\u2019s seemingly illogical desire to destroy its state pillars is actually part of Washington and London\u2019s efforts to consolidate the Western bloc along military lines. After Finland and Sweden join Nato, only a few countries, including Ireland, would remain outside the alliance.\n\nZakharova went on to accuse Ireland of destroying \u201cbilateral political, economic and cultural ties\u201d and \u201champering the normal operation of the Russian embassy in Dublin\u201d.\n\nUpdated at 3.06pm GMT\n\n\n 2.35pm  \n\nDmytro Zhyvytskyi, governor of Sumy, has posted to Telegram to say that emergency electricity shutdowns have been introduced into the region as a result of \u201cenemy attacks in Sumy and the region\u201d.\n\n\n\n 2.33pm  \n\nUkraine\u2019s permanent representative to the United Nations, Sergiy Kyslytsya, has described today\u2019s Russian strikes as Russia \u201cspitting in the face\u201d of fellow attendees at the G20.\n\n\n\n\n 2.32pm  \n\nThe British ambassador to Ukraine, Melinda Simmons, has tweeted: \u201cAs night follows day, Russia follows up humiliating withdrawal from Kherson with missile strikes on energy infrastructure in Kyiv and elsewhere.

Italy\u2019s La Repubblica reported that some Nato allies envisaged talks beginning after Ukraine recaptured Kherson. On Friday, Ukraine announced Russian forces had fled the right bank of Kherson, but they still occupy the left side.\nIn response, President Zelenskiy and his aides adamantly ruled out talks, saying that first Russia must withdraw its troops from Ukraine and the country\u2019s international borders are re-established.\nSpeaking to the G20 summit, Zelenskiy said there would be no Minsk-3, referring to the failed peace accords Ukraine signed under pressure in 2015. The ceasefire was never adhered to by either side and the political points of the agreement would have given Russia\u2019s proxies in eastern Ukraine a right to vote over Ukrainian legislation, if implemented.\nThe latest public pushback of the allies pressure to conclude the war in the near future has come from Ukraine\u2019s army chief, Valerii Zaluzhnyi.\nOn Monday, in a phone call with his US counterpart, Gen Mark Milley, Zaluzhnyi said Ukraine\u2019s military would not accept a compromise solution to the war.\n\nI have assured (Milley) that we will fight until we have no strength. Our objective is to liberate the whole Ukrainian land from Russian occupation. We will not stop on this path under any circumstances. Ukrainian soldiers will accept no negotiations, agreements or compromise solutions. The only term for negotiation: Russia must leave all the occupied territories.\n\nZaluzhnyi further informed Milley of Ukraine\u2019s efforts to defend its northern border with Belarus. In this last month, satellites have detected a build-up of Russian forces and equipment in Belarus.\nZaluzhnyi said that despite facing \u201ctremendous\u201d resistance from Russian troops, Ukraine\u2019s forces were pushing to retake the final slither of occupied Kharkiv region.\nMeanwhile, Ukraine\u2019s forces were defending against a four-pronged offensive in Donetsk region and consolidating their recent advances in Kherson by building defences.\n\nUpdated at 1.53pm GMT\n\n\n 12.52pm  \n\nA western official warned that fighting in Ukraine was likely to descend into a grind throughout 2023 following Russia\u2019s retreat from Kherson in which neither side is able to achieve a military breakthrough.\nThe gloomy assessment - if proved accurate - would ultimately favour Russia because it occupies a large swathe of Ukrainian territory and comes amid warnings of ammunition shortages on both sides and the impending onset of winter.\nThe western official, who was speaking on condition of anonymity, said:\n\nIf we take a big picture overall as we go into 2023, we are still expecting the grind. We are still expecting it to be largely static, and we still expect neither side to particularly win or lose, and really that extends all the way through 2023.\n\nThe official also stressed that any predictions about the future course of the war remain difficult to make, not least because of the offensive creativity of the Ukrainian forces. \u201cThe Ukrainians continue to surprise us,\u201d they added, a reference to autumn successes near Kharkiv and most recently in Kherson.\nMunitions supply is deemed to be a significant limiting factor for both sides, who are now deemed to be engaged in a race to rebuild stockpiles ahead of next spring. Ukrainian estimates that Russia has reduced its stock of Iskander cruise missiles to around 120 from around 900 pre-war, are thought to be accurate, officials indicated.\nRussia successfully evacuated around 20,000 from the Kherson pocket in the period running up to the formal withdrawal announcement last week, and the west believes very few were left behind. Unlike previous withdrawals from Kyiv in April and near Kharkiv in September, it was relatively well organised and the number of abandoned vehicles was \u201cin the tens not the hundreds\u201d.\nThe official said they believed it will be very difficult for Ukraine to cross the Dnipro en masse - despite reports of raids across the river - where the Russians have built what were described as relatively old-fashioned but effective fortifications. \nMeanwhile, they were monitoring whether Russia would try to move several thousand troops from Kherson to the Donbas and whether \u201cRussia will be able to generate an offensive striking force in the Donbas region\u201d. Russian attacks have been halted for months by well organised Ukrainian defences.\n\n\n\n 12.44pm  \nMacron: China 'calls for respect for Ukraine's territorial integrity'\n\nFrance\u2019s president, Emmanuel Macron, expressed \u201cdeep concern\u201d over Russia\u2019s choice to continue its war in Ukraine, the French presidency said after a meeting between Macron and his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, on the sidelines of the G20 summit.\nIn a statement, Macron\u2019s office added:\n\nThe consequences of this conflict go beyond Europe\u2019s borders and should be overcome with close cooperation between France and China.\n\nMacron and Xi agreed it was urgent to de-escalate the conflict and reaffirmed their position on preventing the use of nuclear weapons, the French presidency added.\nMacron tweeted that he and Xi both \u201ccall for respect for Ukraine\u2019s territorial integrity and sovereignty\u201d.\n\nHowever, Beijing\u2019s readout of the pair\u2019s meeting made no mention of Ukraine until the final paragraph, which said:\n\nPresident Xi made the point that China\u2019s position on the Ukraine crisis is clear and consistent; China stands for ceasefire, cessation of the conflict and peace talks.\n\n\nUpdated at 1.54pm GMT\n\n\n 12.36pm  \n\nWe are in Posad-Pokrovske, a frontline village in the Kherson region.\nRussian and Ukrainian forces took and retook control of this village at least seven times. As a result, Posad-Pokrovske was razed to the ground. \n\n\n\n\n 12.32pm  \n\nRussia may have delayed announcing its withdrawal from Kherson in part to avoid giving President Joe Biden a political win ahead of the US midterm elections last week, according to a report.\nThe US has intelligence that senior Russian officials discussed the US midterm elections as a factor during deliberations about the withdrawal announcement, one source told CNN.\nThe intelligence signals Russia has a continued interest in influencing the US political landscape, and comes after President Biden suggested the timing of Moscow\u2019s withdrawal announcement was more than just coincidence.\nAt a press conference last Wednesday, Biden said:\n\nI find it interesting they waited until after the election to make that judgment, which we knew for some time they were going to be doing, and it\u2019s evidence of the fact that they have some real problems \u2013 the Russian military.\n\n\nUpdated at 12.44pm GMT\n\n\n 12.26pm  \n\nRussian-installed civil servants in Nova Kakhovka, the second-largest city in the Kherson region of southern Ukraine, have left due to intensified shelling, according to officials.\nThe city\u2019s Russian-installed administration said:\n\nEmployees of the Nova Kakhovka city state administration and state and municipal institutions also left the city and were relocated to safe areas in the region.\n\n\n\n\n 12.06pm  \nLavrov: Ukraine\u2019s terms for restarting talks with Russia \u2018unrealistic\u2019\n\nHere\u2019s more detail from Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov\u2019s comments to reporters at the G20 summit earlier, where he said Ukraine\u2019s conditions for restarting talks with Moscow were \u201cunrealistic\u201d.\nLavrov said:\n\nAll problems are with the Ukrainian side, which is categorically refusing negotiations and putting forward conditions that are obviously unrealistic.\n\nUkraine\u2019s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy has ruled out peace negotiations with Moscow as long as Vladimir Putin remains in power, after the Russian leader proclaimed the annexation of four Ukrainian regions in September.\nLavrov said western countries are \u201cwell aware that this process is hindered by Ukraine, which, including through laws, by Zelenskiy\u2019s decree, bans negotiations with the Russian Federation\u201d, adding:\n\nWe want to see concrete evidence that the west is seriously interested in disciplining Zelenskiy and explaining to him that this cannot continue, that this is not in the interests of the Ukrainian people.\n\nMykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to President Zelenskiy, responded to Lavrov\u2019s remarks by blaming the continuation of the war on the Russian minister\u2019s \u201cpublic manipulation and unwillingness to stop murdering\u201d.\n\nSpeaking at the G20 summit, Lavrov also accused western leaders of trying to \u201cpoliticise\u201d a joint declaration, a draft of which states that \u201cmost\u201d members strongly condemn the war in Ukraine. He said:\n\nOur Western colleagues tried in every way to make that declaration politicised and tried to push through language that implied condemning the actions of the Russian Federation on behalf of the entire G20, which includes us.\n\n\nUpdated at 12.10pm GMT\n\n\n 11.38am  \n\nAsked about reports that G20 leaders could agree to a draft communique rejecting the era of war and condemning the use of nuclear weapons, a spokesperson for Britain\u2019s prime minister, Rishi Sunak, replied:\n\nObviously we want any communique, should it be agreed, to be as strong as possible, recognising that the G20 is a different forum to the G7 and that it\u2019s largely focused on economic issues. But I wouldn\u2019t comment as inevitably there\u2019s more speculation about what may or may not be in it.\n\nAsked if Sunak has become more confident that a statement will be agreed, they said:\n\nI\u2019m not going to put a prediction on the communique. What\u2019s important is what actions come out of this. Continued support for Ukraine from a wide variety of countries.\n\n\nUpdated at 11.51am GMT\n\n\n 11.28am  \nReports of Ukrainian forces retaking eastern bank of Kherson\n\nRumours have been circulating on Telegram channels that Ukrainian forces have retaken settlements on the eastern bank of Kherson region, after pushing Russian forces from the west bank on Friday. Kherson region is divided by the River Dnipro.\nThese rumours about a new stage in the Ukrainian offensive come in addition to a statement on Saturday by Ukraine\u2019s southern command that combat activities were ongoing to retake the Kinburn peninsula, which sits just south of Mykolaiv and Kherson regions in the Black Sea.\nBut news about an offensive on those fronts was absent from the morning update from Ukraine\u2019s general staff. Ukraine\u2019s authorities often delay confirming a successful battle or operation until a day or two after its completion. They have also urged people to refrain from divulging the details of active battles or Ukrainian military plans so as not to give Russia a tactical advantage.\nThe head of Ukraine\u2019s presidential administration, Andriy Yermak, played to the rumours that the Kinburn peninsula had been freed by posting cryptic emojis on his Telegram. The message including a wave emoji followed by a beach emoji and then the equals sign followed by a flexed muscle. Yermak has become known for his emoji messages. Later on Monday, he posted the word \u201cpatience\u201d.\nThe southern command\u2019s Monday evening report stated that Russia had tried to attack the Ukrainian mainland town of Ochakiv from the Kinburn peninsula and that the Ukrainian forces had destroyed a large Russian ammunition stockpile in Oleshky, the town on the left bank that was rumoured to have been retaken.\nThe spokesperson for Ukraine\u2019s southern command, Natalia Humeniuk, said on Ukrainian United News on Tuesday that the south continued to be an area of ongoing battles so \u201cwe are keeping quiet about it now\u201d.\nHowever, speaking to Espresso TV, also on Tuesday, she said Russian forces had retreated from their defensive positions along the left side of the riverbank by 15-20km in order to avoid being shelled by the Ukrainians.\n\u201cWe do not stand still and (we) employ counter-battery fire, said Humeniuk, which includes multiple rocket laughers, artillery and mortars. \u201cIn connection with this \u2026 enemy troops on the left bank of the Dnipro (are) moving 15-20 km back from the shore.\u201d\n\nUpdated at 11.54am GMT\n\n\n 11.14am  \n\nThe head of football\u2019s world governing body, Fifa, issued a plea on Tuesday for a ceasefire in the war in Ukraine for the duration of the World Cup, calling for all sides to use the tournament as a \u201cpositive trigger\u201d to work towards a resolution.\nGianni Infantino, speaking during a lunch with leaders of the G20 major economies on the Indonesian island of Bali, said the month-long World Cup, which starts in Qatar on Sunday, offered a unique platform for peace. Fifa\u2019s president said:\n\nMy plea to all of you, to think on a temporary ceasefire for one month for the duration of the World Cup, or at least the implementation of some humanitarian corridors or anything that could lead to the resumption of dialogue as a first step to peace.\n\n\n\nYou\u2019re the world leaders, you have the ability to influence the course of history. Football and the World Cup are offering you and the world a unique platform of unity and peace all over the world.\n\nRussia reached the quarter-finals of the last World Cup in 2018, which it hosted, but has been barred from this tournament over its invasion of Ukraine. Ukraine came close to qualifying for Qatar but lost out to Wales in a deciding playoff in June.\nInfantino noted that Russia hosted the 2018 edition and Ukraine is bidding to hold the 2030 contest, and as many as 5.5 billion people are expected to watch this year\u2019s event, which could give a message of hope. He said:\n\nMaybe the current World Cup, starting in five days, can be that positive trigger.\n\nRead the full story here:\n\n\n\n\n 11.01am  \nSummary of the day so far \u2026\n\n\nIn his address to world leaders gathered for the G20 summit in Bali on Tuesday, Volodymyr Zelenskiy outlined a series of conditions needed to end the war in Ukraine. Speaking virtually from Ukraine, he said Russia must reaffirm the territorial integrity of Ukraine, withdraw its troops from Ukrainian territory and pay compensation for damage caused. Zelenskiy is calling for an international conference to \u201ccement key element of the postwar security architecture\u201d and prevent a recurrence of \u201cRussian aggression\u201d.\nKremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov has said that Zelenskiy\u2019s statement that there will be no \u201cMinsk-3\u201d deal to end the fighting in Ukraine confirms that Kyiv is not interested in holding peace talks with Moscow.\nThe UN human rights office (OHCHR) said on Tuesday that both Russia and Ukraine have tortured prisoners of war during the nearly-nine-month conflict, citing examples including the use of electric shocks and forced nudity.\nMatilda Bogner, head of the monitoring mission, told a Geneva press briefing that the \u201cvast majority\u201d of Ukrainian prisoners they interviewed held by Russian forces reported torture and ill-treatment. She gave examples of dog attacks, electric shocks with Tasers and military phones and sexual violence. On the Ukrainian side, Bogner reported \u201ccredible allegations\u201d of summary executions of Russian prisoners among other abuses.\nThere are encouraging signs at the G20 meeting in Bali for a consensus that Russia\u2019s war against Ukraine is not acceptable and that nuclear weapons must not be used, German chancellor Olaf Scholz has said. \u201cThis is a consensus that is gaining ground here,\u201d he told the media.\nThe Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, told reporters at the G20 summit in Bali on Tuesday that the United Nations had told him of written US and EU promises to remove obstacles to the export of Russian grain and fertilisers to world markets. Lavrov said he had received undertakings on this from the UN secretary general, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres.\nIndia\u2019s prime minister, Narendra Modi, has urged a return to diplomacy to end the Russia-Ukraine war, reiterating the south Asian nation\u2019s call for peace in the ongoing conflict. \u201cI have repeatedly said that we have to find a way to return to the path of ceasefire and diplomacy in Ukraine,\u201d Modi said in his opening remarks at the G20 summit.\nGermany will establish a maintenance hub in Slovakia to service and repair weapons it has delivered to Ukraine, German defence minister Christine Lambrecht said.\nRussia\u2019s foreign ministry said it was working to ascertain details about the death of Zambian student on the frontline in Ukraine. Zambia on Monday asked Russia to explain how one of its citizens who had been serving a prison sentence in Moscow had ended up on the battlefield in Ukraine.\nZelenskiy has said Russian troops have \u201cdestroyed absolutely all critical infrastructure\u201d in Kherson. \u201cThere is no electricity, no communication, no internet, no television \u2026 Russian occupiers destroyed absolutely all critical infrastructure for the people,\u201d he said in his Monday evening address. Ukrainian national energy company Ukrenergo said Russia also destroyed key energy infrastructure in the region. \u201cThe energy facility that provided power supply to the entire right bank of the Kherson region and a significant part of the Mykolaiv region, is practically destroyed,\u201d Ukrenergo chief Volodymyr Kudrytskyi said.\n\nThat is it from me, Martin Belam, for now. I will hand you over to L\u00e9onie Chao-Fong, and I will be back later on.\n\nUpdated at 11.08am GMT\n\n\n 10.34am  \n\nReuters is carrying some additional details on the allegation that both Ukrainian and Russian forces have mistreated prisoners of war during the conflict.\nMatilda Bogner, head of the UN\u2019s OHCHR monitoring mission, told a Geneva press briefing that the \u201cvast majority\u201d of Ukrainian prisoners they interviewed held by Russian forces reported torture and ill-treatment.\nShe gave examples of dog attacks, electric shocks with Tasers and military phones and sexual violence.\nShe said the treatment was aimed at intimidating and humiliating them. One man in a penal colony near Olenivka told the team that members of Russian-affiliated armed groups \u201cattached wires to my genitalia and nose and shocked me. They simply had fun and were not interested in my replies to their questions.\u201d\nOn the Ukrainian side, Bogner reported \u201ccredible allegations\u201d of summary executions of Russian prisoners among other abuses.\nOther Russian prisoners reported poor and humiliating conditions of transport and of being packed into trucks or vans naked, with their hands tied behind their backs. The UN team said it had also documented cases of so-called \u201cwelcome beatings\u201d at a penal colony.\n\n\n\n 10.22am  \n\nThere are encouraging signs at the G20 meeting in Bali for a consensus that Russia\u2019s war against Ukraine is not acceptable and that nuclear weapons must not be used, German chancellor Olaf Scholz has said.\n\u201cThis is a consensus that is gaining ground here,\u201d Reuters reports he told the media in Bali.\nAsked about a conversation with the Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, Scholz said: \u201cHe stood near me and said a couple of sentences, that was the conversation.\u201d\nScholz also said he would continue to talk to Russia\u2019s president, Vladimir Putin, to find solutions to end the war against Ukraine.\n\nUpdated at 10.32am GMT\n\n\n 10.20am  \nUN human rights office: both Russia and Ukraine have tortured prisoners of war\n\nThe UN human rights office (OHCHR) said on Tuesday that both Russia and Ukraine have tortured prisoners of war during the nearly-nine-month conflict, citing examples including the use of electric shocks and forced nudity.\nReuters reports the UN Ukraine-based monitoring team based its findings on interviews with more than 100 prisoners of war on each side of the conflict. The interviews with Ukrainian prisoners of war were conducted after their release, since Russia did not grant access to detention sites, it said.\nRussia, which invaded Ukraine on 24 February, denies torture or other forms of maltreatment of PoWs. Kyiv has previously said it checks all information regarding the treatment of PoWs and will investigate any violations and take appropriate legal action.\nThe OHCHR has also issued updated civilian casualty figures for the war in a bulletin updated on Monday. It put the figure for civilian casualties at 6,557 killed and 10,074 injured. The bulletin adds:\n\nMost of the civilian casualties recorded were caused by the use of explosive weapons with wide area effects, including shelling from heavy artillery, multiple launch rocket systems, missiles and airstrikes. OHCHR believes that the actual figures are considerably higher, as the receipt of information from some locations where intense hostilities have been going on has been delayed and many reports are still pending corroboration.\n\n\nUpdated at 10.24am GMT\n\n\n 10.09am  \n\nThe Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, told reporters at the G20 summit in Bali on Tuesday that the United Nations had told him of written US and EU promises to remove obstacles to the export of Russian grain and fertilisers to world markets.\nLavrov said he had received undertakings on this from the UN secretary general, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, Reuters reports.\nRussian grains and fertilisers are not directly targeted by western sanctions, but Moscow has complained for months that they are effectively restricted because the sanctions limit access to ports, finance and insurance.\n\nUpdated at 10.25am GMT\n\n\n 9.57am  \n\nOleksandr Syenkevych, the mayor of Mykolaiv, has reported on Telegram that there is an air raid alert in place in the city.\n\nUpdated at 10.11am GMT\n\n\n 9.51am  \n\nRussia\u2019s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, is giving a press briefing at the G20 summit in Bali. We will bring you fuller quotes in due course, but so far he has accused the west of trying to politicise the traditional joint message at the end of the summit by mentioning Ukraine. He also said that he had discussed Ukraine with German chancellor Olaf Scholz and French president Emmanuel Macron, that the hybrid war in Ukraine had been started by the west, and that Ukraine was prolonging the conflict.\n\nUpdated at 9.55am GMT\n\n\n 9.36am  \n\nHere is the video clip of the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, calling via video link at the G20 for a \u201cjust\u201d end to Russia\u2019s invasion. Zelenskiy said Kyiv should not be pushed to compromise on its sovereignty or territorial integrity. \u201cUkraine\u2019s control over all sections of our state border with Russia must be restored. This will result in a real and complete cessation of hostilities,\u201d he said.\n\n\nUpdated at 9.55am GMT\n\n\n 9.23am  \n\nRussia\u2019s foreign ministry said on Tuesday it was working to ascertain details about the death of Zambian student on the frontline in Ukraine, Reuters report, citing the Tass news agency.\nZambia on Monday asked Russia to explain how one of its citizens who had been serving a prison sentence in Moscow had ended up on the battlefield in Ukraine.\n\n\n\n 9.22am  \n\nGermany will establish a maintenance hub in Slovakia to service and repair weapons it has delivered to Ukraine, German defence minister Christine Lambrecht said.\n\u201cWe have reached agreement, and work can start immediately so that all the equipment which has been supplied [to Kyiv] can be repaired after coming out of battle,\u201d Reuters reports she told the media as she arrived for a meeting with her EU counterparts in Brussels.\nBerlin is planning to train 5,000 Ukrainian soldiers in Germany as part of an EU training mission by June, she added.\n\nUpdated at 9.27am GMT\n\n\n 9.05am  \n\nThe Guardian\u2019s diplomatic editor Patrick Wintour reports from Bali:\nIf Sergei Lavrov, the 72-year-old whiskey-drinking Russian foreign minister, had indeed suffered a heart flutter soon after stepping off the plane in Bali it would have been understandable for a man who has been cast by his leader as his stand-in punchbag at the summit.\nViewing the forces arrayed against him at the G20, President Vladimir Putin deputed Lavrov to attend the two-day event in his stead, and for a brief moment it appeared to have been too much. News agencies reported Lavrov had been sent to hospital for a check-up, only for the Russian foreign ministry to rush out a picture of Lavrov in shorts and sporting an Apple watch and Jean-Michel Basquiat-inspired T-shirt thumbing his notes for his first address at the summit on Tuesday.\nThe Russian foreign ministry had a field day denouncing what it called western propaganda as a high-level lie.\nOddly, if Lavrov has succumbed to genuine ill-health, it would have been a moment of genuine regret for some western diplomats, who over two decades have become inured to this fixture of Russian diplomacy.\n\u201cHe is a rogue,\u201d said one western diplomat, \u201cbut we all know his outbursts are stage-managed, and calculated. It\u2019s all smiles afterwards. He is a professional.\u201d\nWith a glamorous step-daughter Polina, his career in service of the Russian state has been well spent and rewarded.\nRead more of Patrick Wintour\u2019s profile here: Sergei Lavrov, a fixture of Russian diplomacy facing his toughest test in Ukraine\n\n\n\n\n 8.47am  \n\nBilateral meetings continue as part of the G20 summit in Bali.

[See 6.30 GMT]\nRussia commenced its latest invasion of Ukraine in February this year, and in September claimed to have annexed four regions of Ukraine into the Russian Federation.\n\nUpdated at 7.32am GMT\n\n\n 7.24am  \n\nTobias Ellwood, who is a Conservative MP and chair of the defence select committee in the UK\u2019s parliament, has been interviewed by Sky News during his visit to Odesa. He told viewers in the UK it was a worry that the west\u2019s commitment to Ukraine might drain away. He said:\n\nWe don\u2019t have good form on this. If you look at all the places that we\u2019ve been to, to try and provide a force for good, from Libya, Somalia, Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, and so forth, we\u2019ve actually given up and gone home leaving problems there. We must not do the same here.\n\nHe said it was important \u201cwe don\u2019t give up now, that we don\u2019t sign a deal, that we don\u2019t step back, but we\u2019re able to flush Russia completely out of Ukraine\u201d.\nHe was critical of Russia\u2019s message at the G20, saying:\n\nLavrov is just going to give us the lines that Putin has been spouting, to say that this is nobody else\u2019s business. It is our business, because the grain ships behind me are not moving as they should do. Security in eastern Europe is everybody\u2019s security. If we don\u2019t flush Russia out of Ukraine now, how can the Ukrainian economy move forward? How can the sovereign identity of Ukraine exist?\n\nEllwood also said that while the victory in Kherson was welcome, the west needed to continue to prepare for what came next. He said:\n\nKherson is massively humiliating for Putin. They\u2019ve had to withdraw across the Dnipro River. But Russia still has control of land the size of Portugal in Ukraine. So this is far from over. Jens Stoltenberg is absolutely right to encourage Nato members to continue providing individual bilateral support \u2013 as Britain is doing \u2013 because munitions and so forth, weapon systems, they need to keep going.\n\n\nUpdated at 7.33am GMT\n\n\n 7.03am  \n\nThe Ukrainian presidential adviser, Anton Gerashchenko, has published a photo purportedly from the recently liberated city of Kherson to illustrate the lack of power in the region.\n\u201cKherson.

The Russian armed forces retain significant capabilities, as well as a large number of troops.\nThe coming months will be difficult. Putin\u2019s aim is to leave Ukraine cold and dark this winter. So we must stay the course.\u201d\n\n\nUpdated at 7.15am GMT\n\n\n 6.35am  \nIndonesia\u2019s president says world 'must not fall into another cold war'\n\nPresident Joko Widodo has called for unity at the opening of the G20 summit, and said that the gathered leaders must not allow the world to fall into another cold war.\nHis remarks will probably be interpreted as a commentary on the effects that Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine is having on the wider global economy.\nWithout referring directly to the war in Ukraine, Widodo said that if the war did not end, it would be difficult for the world to move forward.\n\u201cIndonesia has tried as best as possible to bridge very wide differences. We have no other option, collaboration is badly needed,\u201d he said.\n\nUpdated at 6.53am GMT\n\n\n 6.30am  \nZelenskiy details 'Ukrainian formula for peace'\n\nUkraine\u2019s president followed up on the comments he made to G20 leaders with a statement posted on his Telegram channel on Tuesday.\n\nIt is not worth offering Ukraine compromises with conscience, sovereignty, territory and independence.\n\u2026 if Russia says that it supposedly wants to end this war, let it prove it with actions.\nWe will not allow Russia to wait, build up its forces, and then start a new series of terror and global destabilisation. There will be no Minsk-3, which Russia will violate immediately after the agreement.\nThere is a Ukrainian formula for peace. Peace for Ukraine, Europe and the world. And there is a set of solutions that can be implemented to really guarantee peace.\nHaving participated in the G20 summit, I presented proposals for such solutions \u2013 specific and honest. Ukraine offers the leading states of the world to be co-creators of peace together with us.\u201d\n\nZelenskiy then outlined 10 proposals of Ukraine:\n\n1. Radiation and nuclear safety.2. Food safety.3. Energy security.4. Release of all prisoners and deportees.5. Implementation of the UN charter and restoration of the territorial integrity of Ukraine and the world order.6.

Beijing\u2019s readout from the long-awaited meeting in Bali differed slightly and did not mention the pair agreeing on opposing Russia\u2019s threat of using nuclear weapons in the Ukraine war. However, on Sunday, Chinese premier Li Keqiang emphasised the \u201cirresponsibility\u201d of nuclear threats, suggesting China was uncomfortable with Russia\u2019s nuclear rhetoric, a senior US official said.\n\n\nZelenskiy welcomed statements from the US and China. \u201cThis is a grouping of very weighty states. And today, on the eve of the summit, weighty statements have already been made,\u201d he said in his Monday night video address. \u201cIn particular, it is important that the United States and China jointly highlighted that the threats of using nuclear weapons were unacceptable.

The meeting in Ankara with the head of Russia\u2019s SVR foreign intelligence service, Sergei Naryshkin, followed speculation that some senior US figures would like Ukraine to enter negotiations with the Kremlin to end the war.

The UK prime minister said he would take every opportunity during the summit to confront Russia\u2019s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, attending in Vladimir Putin\u2019s absence. \u201cRussia is becoming a pariah state and he\u2019s [Putin] not there to take responsibility for what he\u2019s doing,\u201d Sunak told reporters.\n\n\nThe EU and its member states have so far provided weapons and military equipment worth a total of at least \u20ac8bn (\u00a37bn) to Ukraine, according to the bloc\u2019s foreign policy chief Josep Borrell.\nA former Russian prison inmate, who defected to Ukraine after being recruited by the Kremlin-linked private military group Wagner, was reportedly executed and repeatedly struck with a sledgehammer.

Toulouse, the defending champions, return to the Aviva Stadium, having last week edged past Munster in a place-kicking shootout following their 24-24 draw at the same venue. The match is a repeat of the 2019 semi-final, also played at the Aviva Stadium, with Leinster running out 30-12 winners. Toulouse have won the tournament five times but Leinster are the favourites to add to their four titles, having ruthlessly dispatched Leicester in the previous round. Leinster are unchanged from that match while Mola has tweaked his side with Cyril Baille and Anthony Jelonch coming into the pack and Juan Cruz Mall\u00eda selected on the right wing.  \u201cWe play a team that totally masters the European games,\u201d said Mola. \u201cThree years ago, they took us out [in] the semi-finals. We learned a lot that day, and three years later we are no longer the same [team]. But neither [are] they. \u201cLeinster remains in my eyes a reference of European rugby, with this ability to provoke things, to have a structured, inspired and inspiring rugby. I remain convinced that they are the best team in Europe, for a very long time, in their rugby. In his way of thinking about rugby, with a philosophy and a whole organisation around this philosophy.\u201d  On Sunday, Racing 92 face La Rochelle in a repeat of last season\u2019s semi-final. Racing have selected Virimi Vakatawa at centre in place of Henry Chavancy and handed a starting place to the Springbok prop Trevor Nyakane. La Rochelle have made just one change with Jonathan Danty coming in at inside-centre. Meanwhile, in the Challenge Cup, Saracens are away to Toulon in their semi-final while Wasps travel to Lyon. The Wasps scrum-half Dan Robson said: \u201cYou can see the pedigree of the last four teams in it. We know this is a chance of getting silverware which would make the season a great success. We\u2019ve proven this year that in one-off games we can beat anyone. We\u2019ve had some big games and when we\u2019ve turned up we\u2019ve been pretty good. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to have that belief going into this game. It\u2019s going to be pretty hostile in Lyon, they\u2019ve got some dangerous individuals and they\u2019re a pretty big side. But we know that if we can get some momentum we\u2019re going to cause them some trouble.\u201d "

The former Brazil and Manchester City midfielder Elano has said he persuaded the then Santos president, Modesto Roma J\u00fanior, to abandon plans to sell Rodrygo to Liverpool. Elano was working as an assistant coach at Santos and a 16-year-old Rodrygo was yet to make his first-team debut.  Elano, highly regarded at Santos where he had three spells as a player before moving into coaching, was struck by Rodrygo\u2019s talent and threatened to quit if Liverpool\u2019s offer was accepted. \u201c\u2018You can\u2019t sell him. If you sell him, I\u2019m out,\u2019\u201d Elano says he told the president. \u201c\u2018What is \u20ac3m nowadays? Nothing!\u2019  \u201cHe wanted to sell Rodrygo but I insisted and he got my point and stopped the negotiations for him. Everyone won, except me because I was fired months later by the new president, Jos\u00e9 Carlos Peres.\u201d In June 2018, Madrid agreed to buy Rodrygo for \u20ac45m, with the player joining a year later. He has made more than 100 appearances for Madrid, winning two La Liga titles and last month\u2019s Champions League final against Liverpool, when he came on as a substitute. The 21-year-old, who has five Brazil caps, scored two dramatic late goals that forced extra time in the Champions League semi-final against Manchester City and scored against Chelsea in the previous round to also force extra time."

                    "body": "I don\u2019t think a picture is always worth a thousand words, but this week I saw one worth twice as many. The photograph was taken 70 years ago and features six women in their 20s who I have never met and almost certainly never will. Yet the connection I have with them is real. You see, they support the same football team as I do: West Bromwich Albion. And I can\u2019t help but use the present tense, even though they\u2019re almost certainly no longer with us. I use that f-word, football, advisedly too, because I know the very sight of it is enough for some readers to read no further. Please stick with me, those of you who just don\u2019t get it, because this is especially for you. It\u2019s incredibly difficult to explain loyalty to \u2013 indeed love for \u2013 a particular football club to someone who has no club of their own demanding their devotion. To be honest, I\u2019ve lately been struggling to explain it to myself. My team\u2019s been in freefall for a good five years, on and off the pitch. The club is owned by someone a long way away who wants to sell it but can\u2019t find anyone to pay the price he wants. And if he can\u2019t get his money back by selling, there\u2019s no knowing what he could and might do. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I still cared \u2013 a lot \u2013 but I had never cared less. Then I saw this photograph and it all came flooding back. It was on a wall in a small room in the house of a friend in Warwickshire. My mate Dean\u2019s late mum, Betty, is second on the left. They\u2019re on a terrace at St James\u2019 Park, Newcastle United\u2019s ground, where Gateshead AFC were playing my and Betty\u2019s team, West Brom. This was the fourth round of the FA Cup in February 1952. The sight of these be-scarfed women a long way from home on a winter\u2019s afternoon in the middle of the last century felt like an injection from Dr Football straight into my veins. I remembered how much I cared, how much I had to care, kind of in honour of those fans who came before me. It\u2019s just 22 daft men kicking a ball about, is what the don\u2019t-get-its say. But that\u2019s almost the last thing it\u2019s about. The match itself was scheduled for Saturday, 2 February but, due to snow, was postponed. At some stage Betty and her posse helped clear the pitch to get the game on. The photo, we think, is from a newspaper article praising their efforts. Newcastle was a long way from West Bromwich by charabanc in 1952 so, in gratitude for their efforts, Betty, her husband and presumably many others were put up by locals until the game could be played on Wednesday, 6 February. Photographs suggest St James\u2019 Park was packed, which is fascinating because early that morning King George VI died, his passing announced by the BBC at 11.15am. I won\u2019t mention the score because the score, in the context of visceral, familial football fandom, century in, century out, doesn\u2019t matter. What matters is that Betty and her like made that journey in the name of her club, and Newcastle and Gateshead fans made them welcome in the name of their clubs. And the match went on. And then the charabancs inched their way home. West Brom are now owned by someone in China and Newcastle United are owned by Saudis. Gateshead AFC folded in 1973, making way for a Gateshead United to bear the name until it folded in 1977, at which point Gateshead FC took up the baton. Whoever or whatever thinks they own our clubs, they kid themselves. They\u2019re merely custodians, be they good ones or bad ones. The souls of the clubs are for ever ours. In memory of Elizabeth (Betty) Walton, 1929-1998. \u2022 Adrian Chiles is a broadcaster, writer and Guardian columnist "

Ch-Check It Out.\n\n\n\n\n\n 5.50pm  \n\nHow good are Newcastle? The table shows them in seventh place. About right? Some analysis and number crunching here from PA Media which we\u2019ll condense into bullet points. In summary: strong against the rank and file; shite against big teams.\n\nNewcastle have amassed 57 points in 39 Premier League matches during the year since the Saudi takeover. This amounts to their best 39-game spell since December 2012 - a run that comprised a fifth-place finish under Alan Pardew in 2011-12.\nThe Magpies rank seventh in the top flight on a points per game basis over the past 12 months, behind only the \u2018big six\u2019 of Manchester City, Liverpool, Arsenal, Tottenham, Chelsea and Manchester United.\nThe Magpies have a superb record against clubs outside the \u2018big six\u2019 in the past 12 months, winning 14 and losing just two of 26 matches for an average of two points per game.\nIn stark contrast, they have suffered 10 defeats in 13 meetings with the \u2018big six\u2019, with their solitary win coming at home to Arsenal towards the end of last season.\n\n\n\n\n 5.40pm  \n\nFancy a quiz? Football features in 50% of the questions. You can surely beat my 6 out of 10.\n\n\n\n\n 5.31pm  \n\nSteve Davis and James Collins will be the men in the dugout for Wolves at Chelsea this weekend. Under-18s head coach Davis was placed in temporary charge along with Collins, who has the same role with the under-21s, following the sacking of Bruno Lage. \n\nSome background From Reuters on how that came about\u2026\nDavis said of his conversations with Wolves chairman Jeff Shi: \u201cI was watching my grandson in Keele University on Sunday and late afternoon I got a call to come down Monday and meet with him just to discuss things going forward.\n\u201cAt that point I wasn\u2019t aware of the situation. Then James was told a little bit later because we had a game against Man City in the Under-21s. We then spoke to each other just to see what we thought and then Monday we spoke about what we were going to do for the rest of the week.\n\u201cI\u2019ve supported this football club since I was six, so over 50 years now. I can\u2019t describe how it feels. My dad took me as a boy back in the 70s.\n\u201cI remember a lot of very, very good teams. This is probably one of the most talented groups I\u2019ve seen technically. Having been here for a week, they\u2019re fantastic people as well.\u201d\nDavis has been pleased with the reaction of the players and he and Collins will look to put their stamp on things this weekend, which could include a first start for striker Diego Costa, who made a difference off the bench against West Ham.\n\u201cThe spirit\u2019s been good, we\u2019re really pleased with the response,\u201d said Davis, who managed Crewe for more than five years before joining Wolves.\n\u201cWe look for commitment, we look for something different, a reaction, and we\u2019ve got that. Hopefully we\u2019ll be brave in our selections.\n\u201cIt is a chance to change things but if you change too much in a short space of time it can lead to a bit of confusion, so we\u2019ve tried to run along the same sort of lines but we\u2019ve just tried to add little things, get them smiling and enjoying it. It\u2019s a difficult situation.\n\u201cThey\u2019re top players. I\u2019ve worked with top players and played with top players in the past so I\u2019ve not found it any different really.\u201d\nWolves will be without Ruben Neves, who serves a one-match suspension having picked up five yellow cards this season, but Hwang Hee-chan is fit again.\n\n\n\n 5.20pm  \n\nChelsea boss Graham Potter with some injury updates on defender Wesley Fofana and midfielder N\u2019Golo Kante.\n\u201cWesley\u2019s knee is not as bad as we thought so that is good. It will be a few weeks I think but considerably better than it could be,\u201d Potter told reporters ahead of Saturday\u2019s Premier League home game against Wolverhampton Wanderers.\n\n\u201cA possibility (to play before the World Cup), depending on rehab.\u201d\nKante has not featured since mid-August due to a hamstring problem but Potter insisted he was in no rush to bring the France international back.\n\u201cKante is doing more and more integration with the team. Not ready for the weekend, but getting closer and closer,\u201d he said.\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing we can do, the injury happened. We have to make sure when he\u2019s back, he\u2019s back for good, and strong. It\u2019s something we have to deal with.\u201d\nWolves\u2019 visit will mark the return of former Chelsea striker Diego Costa to Stamford Bridge, where he won two league titles and a League Cup during a three-year spell.\n\u201cWe have a lot of respect for him and his career. He\u2019s at Wolves and he\u2019s going to come and be ready to play,\u201d Potter said of 33-year-old Costa, who scored 59 goals for Chelsea.\n\u201cI followed his career from afar and I\u2019ve got a lot of respect for him. They have a lot of good attacking players so we have to be ready.\u201d (Reuters)\n\n\n\n 5.10pm  \n\nAn update from that terrible story in Argentina.\nThe government of Argentina\u2019s Buenos Aires province said it has fired the head of a security operation carried out on Thursday outside a soccer stadium, which resulted in violent clashes and the death of a fan.\nPolice fired tear gas outside the stadium during a league match between Gimnasia La Plata and Boca Juniors, which then drifted into the stadium making it difficult for players and spectators to breathe, causing people to leave in a state of panic.\nProvince security minister Sergio Berni told local television the fan had died of a heart problem as he was leaving the stadium.\nSome 10,000 people had been waiting outside La Plata\u2019s Juan Zerillo stadium unable to watch the match, according to security personnel, with another 20,000 already filling it inside.\nArgentine authorities said on Friday police used rubber bullets and tear gas to force the fans back as they tried to force their way inside.\nPlayers were seen covering their faces, while supporters entered the field as they tried to escape the tear gas. The Argentine top-flight match was stopped after nine minutes.\nThe province government said it was clear the operation was not able to provide security to those who attended the match, and that it was investigating whether the incident had been caused by overbooking.\n\u201cThe Governor has instructed the security minister that the head of the operation be removed immediately and that all the evidence is placed at the prosecutor\u2019s disposal,\u201d it said.\n\u201cMy two-year-old son couldn\u2019t breathe,\u201d ESPN quoted Gimnasia player Leonardo Morales as saying. \u201cWe feel desperate and worried about all the people in the stands.\n\u201cWe were playing a normal football game and it turned it into this and the feeling that our relatives almost died,\u201d he said.\nThe incident comes five days after a stampede at a soccer game in Indonesia killed at least 131 people when fans tried to flee a riot and tear gas fired by police in one of the world\u2019s worst sporting disasters. (Reuters)\n\n\n\n 5.01pm  \n\nIt\u2019s 5pm. What a perfect time for The Fiver!\n\n\nUpdated at 5.05pm BST\n\n\n 4.53pm  \n\nWest Ham boss David Moyes believes there is still plenty more to come from striker Gianluca Scamacca.\nThe \u00a335 million summer signing made an impact off the bench to grab the goal which secured a 1-0 away win over Anderlecht in their Europa Conference League tie on Thursday evening.\nThat came after the Italy international last weekend produced a fine half-volley to net the opener in a 2-0 win over Wolves as the Hammers claimed only their second Premier League victory of the season.\nHaving now got off the domestic mark to add to previous European strikes, Moyes believes the 23-year-old former Sassuolo forward can continue his progression.\n\n\u201cHe is 23, a young Italian striker in the Premier League and I think he is coming along really well,\u201d Moyes said.\n\u201cHis goals give you confidence, the centre-forwards will tell you that. His form is getting better all round.\n\u201cHis fitness is something he knows he has got more to come and to do more. It is always good when there is room for improvement and progress to be made, but he is doing a good job at the moment.\u201d\nWest Ham\u2019s win over Anderlecht means they have now won four of their last five matches in all competitions, and Moyes is hoping for more of the same when they host Fulham on Sunday.\n\u201cI think it\u2019s huge if we can continue to build that momentum,\u201d he told a press conference.\n\u201cWe want to get on a run of victories. Clean sheets are a good place to start and I can sense that we are a little bit better at the moment.\n\u201cWe are beginning to see performances from a lot of the players we have brought in, and we knew they could give us that.\n\u201cIn the early games of the season we may have hit the bar or so, and we may have not got things right, but there are signs that things are getting better.\u201d\nMoyes confirmed winger Maxwel Cornet will again miss out on Sunday\u2019s game as he recovers from a calf problem which forced him off during the first half of the win over Wolves.\nThe Ivory Coast forward, though, is not expected to be out for an extended spell.\n\u201cHe has got a small calf strain. I don\u2019t think it is as bad as we first feared, but it will keep him out for a few days,\u201d Moyes said.\n\u201cElsewhere, we have got a few knocks and niggles, but hopefully we will be OK by the time we get to Sunday\u2019s game.\u201d (PA Media)\n\n\n\n 4.41pm  \n\nTrent Alexander-Arnold shares a birthday with Vladimir Putin today. Not sure who\u2019s come in for more criticism of late.\n\n\nUpdated at 4.44pm BST\n\n\n 4.33pm  \n\nPatrick Bamford could make his first start for Leeds in almost two months after being declared fit for Sunday\u2019s trip to Crystal Palace.\nAfter a succession of injuries limited the striker to just 11 appearances last season, Bamford has also suffered a disrupted start to this term.His last start for Leeds came away at Southampton on August 13 but he was withdrawn with an adductor injury, and has made only two substitute appearances since.\nBut head coach Jesse Marsch said on Friday the 29-year-old is fit to face one of his former clubs.\n\u201cI think Patrick is fitter and he\u2019s trained well this week, and I think he\u2019s ready to go,\u201d Marsch said.\n\u201cSo I think there\u2019s a high likelihood that he\u2019ll be ready from the start.\u201d\nBamford\u2019s return will be a welcome boost as Marsch must shuffle his pack given Luis Sinisterra\u2019s suspension following a red card in the 0-0 draw against Aston Villa.\nIf Bamford plays, Rodrigo could drop back and Brenden Aaronson move to the right-hand side, although Marsch also backed young Dutch winger Crysencio Summerville to fill that role if required.\nSummerville, 20, has impressed since making his debut at Newcastle a year ago but all nine of his league appearances to date have come from the bench.\n\u201cFirst of all, it\u2019s worth noting that we feel that Cree Summerville is in the best form since I\u2019ve been here,\u201d Marsch said.\n\u201cSo he certainly becomes a factor whether from the start or off the bench.\n\u201cEven if you\u2019re not in the XI, the most important thing is that you\u2019re ready to come and make an impact off the bench.\u201d\nLeeds will be facing a Palace side hovering just outside the bottom three with six points from their seven games to date this term, but Marsch said that was a false position for Patrick Vieira\u2019s men.\n\u201cWhen you talk about the start Palace have had, I think you have to talk about the opponents they\u2019ve had - Man City, Liverpool, Arsenal, Chelsea, Newcastle,\u201d he said.\n\u201cI think if you ask me they\u2019ve played pretty well through that phase.\u201cIt\u2019s a hostile environment down there. Very difficult, they unbalanced us almost the entire match. Tactically we have to be much cleaner.\n\u201c(Wilfried) Zaha\u2019s number one.

Here are more, courtesy of our friends at PA:\n\u201cIt is good that there is clarity to my contract situation because I know there have been a lot of questions over the last few weeks and months so it puts an end to them,\u201d Cooper said. \u201cEveryone who knows me knows how much I have loved and am loving my time at Forest, everyone knows how important it is to me. If I am being really honest, my real focus is about winning a football match. Obviously we are on a poor run of form, let\u2019s not hide away from that. That is the thing that is in my mind more than anything.\n\u201cIt puts clarity on speculation. No one had ever questioned how much I love it here and want to be here, that has never been in question. If there is talk about that it can stop. It doesn\u2019t mean we are going to win the next match and everything is going to be OK. \u201cIt has put an end to the questioning and that is great.\u201d\nThe Welshman insisted he never listened to speculation, saying: \u201cRightly or wrongly, I am not a media follower. I am probably not as informed as what has been said or not said as much as everyone else, but internally there have only been normal conversations. We were obviously disappointed after Monday\u2019s game with the performance and the result. The conversations we have had with the owner and the chief executive have been around that. They have been normal, wider issues that have been reported. I can\u2019t say I have been in any conversations like that.\u201d\nCooper also vowed to pay the fans back for their support: \u201cMy main message, being a leader is about dealing with difficult times,\u201d said Cooper. \u201cI want them to see that I am going to be the guy standing at the front and be the guy that people look at first. And in this difficult time I and my team are going to work harder and be hungrier than before because that is the least these supporters deserve. Incredible support from the fans, which makes me even hungrier to do well.\u201d\n\nUpdated at 3.17pm BST\n\n\n 3.10pm  \n\nCrystal Palace need a mindset shift if they want to stop conceding late goals in close games, said Patrick Vieira.\n\u201cIt\u2019s something we\u2019re looking at closely to try to find the best way not to concede those goals, because those goals are stopping us from taking points that we deserve. When you look at our performances themselves, especially the last game against Chelsea, we deserved to get the points in that game.\n\u201cThere are some mindsets we need to work on to change that. It is about coming from the bench, coming from me as well as a manager, but this is something we have to resolve if we want to win football matches. But, since I\u2019ve been here, we\u2019ve had issues with different parts of the game that we managed to work on and we will improve.

If he doesn\u2019t play (Dejan) Kulusevski, he plays Richarlison, if he doesn\u2019t play (Pierre-Emile) Hojbjerg or (Rodrigo) Bentancur, he can play (Yves) Bissouma.\n\u201cTottenham are a good team, not only the first 11 - but 20 or 22 players.\u201d\n\n\n\n 2.40pm  \n\nI can\u2019t say I\u2019m overly aware of William Saliba being compared to Virgil van Dijk but Mikel Arteta was asked about it in his press conference.\nSo Mikel, could he become as good as VVD? \u201cWow, that\u2019s a really big question. I am really happy with where he is at the moment. He is Saliba, he\u2019s no-one else and he needs to make his own career.\n\u201cThe way he has established himself, the composure and leadership he has shown on the pitch has been really good.\n\u201cAnd then that he has done it in a really natural way without any flashing lights, just being himself.

It\u2019s a really good boost.\n\u201cHe\u2019s a good player for us, pivotal in us staying in the league last year and we want to get him playing regularly.\u201d\nDefenders Yerry Mina and Mason Holgate, neither of whom have featured because of ankle and knee injuries, are also on the road to recovery.\n\u201cThey\u2019re training with us. Yerry joined us in the past couple of days, Mason came in today for part of training. They\u2019re both working hard to get back (to full fitness).\n\u201cThis weekend comes too soon probably for both of them, definitely for Mason, but we hope with a good week\u2019s training next week they can be in contention from then on.\u201d\n\n\n\n 2.01pm  \n\nOver to David Tindall, who\u2019s had his sandwiches, for the next hour.\n\n\n\n 1.59pm  \n\nErik ten Hag wants Manchester United to be nastier and smarter as the manager attempts to make them challengers again.\nAfter United came from behind to beat Omonia Nicosia 3-2 in Thursday\u2019s Europa League group match, Ten Hag said he believed they have to add an edge to their play and be more streetwise to avoid needless yellow cards.

Which is quite correct response of course.\nGuardiola is then asked about his smile on the touchline after one of Haaland\u2019s goals in midweek: \u201cHe has an incredible sense [for where the ball will go] \u2026 he goes one second before the ball arrives. How can I teach him? It\u2019s complete instinct, it\u2019s natural \u2026 he did it in Germany, in Norway, he\u2019s doing it here. Thank you so much for choosing us and to all the people involved to bring him he.

The inside left, who scored 137 goals in 400 appearances for Plymouth between 1921 and 1934, was called-up to the national team in 1925.\nBut Leslie would disgracefully be denied an England appearance due to the colour of his skin after selectors discovered his heritage. The Argyle favourite died in 1988 and is to be immortalised by a statue that will be formally unveiled outside Home Park on Friday. The FA chair Debbie Hewitt has also confirmed that Leslie has been posthumously awarded an England cap 97 years after his call-up.\n\u201cJack Leslie is a true football legend who, through his own adversity, has positively shaped attitudes and behaviours to identify and remove discrimination from football,\u201d she said in a statement.\n\u201cThe FA is awarding Jack a posthumous honorary cap, to recognise his unique contribution and set of circumstances - and to right the historical wrong. I had the privilege of meeting Lesley, Jack\u2019s granddaughter, at a recent international game at Wembley, where we had the opportunity to recognise the family\u2019s determination, courage and resilience to have Jack\u2019s story told and through the efforts of Lesley and her sisters Lyn and Gill, to change perceptions in football and more broadly in society.\n\u201cWe have made progress in recent years to ensure that English football is more diverse and inclusive and a game for all.

They\u2019ve lost their last four in a row but have never lost five league games in a row against Liverpool.\nArsenal are on a run of 13 consecutive Premier League matches without a clean sheet against Liverpool, conceding 39 goals in those games. They have only had one longer run against an opponent without a clean sheet in the competition: 14 versus Man City (ongoing).\nLiverpool\u2019s Diogo Jota has six goals in eight Premier League appearances against Arsenal, including five in four for the Reds.

Darwin Nunez is 80s to bag a hat-trick at Arsenal while Gabriel Jesus and Mo Salah are both quoted at 66s.

He is influential on and off the field so you can\u2019t just replace him with one person overnight.\n\u201cThat just doesn\u2019t happen. It\u2019s about other people filling in the breach. We missed him for a few games last season, it\u2019s just something we have to cope with.\n\u201cI\u2019m disappointed for Callum more than anything because he\u2019s very influential and he wants to be involved all the time. His performances have been super but we just have to deal with what\u2019s ahead of us.\n\u201cThe one thing I know about Callum is whatever timeline they give him, he\u2019ll try and come back earlier. That\u2019s what happened last year with his cheek fracture. He got the mask on and played.\n\u201cHe\u2019s been around long enough to know this is part of being a professional footballer. You\u2019re not always going to play 70 games a year. Injuries will happen. He\u2019s just been unlucky the other night.

Here\u2019s more from Gerrard on Aston Villa\u2019s trip to Nottingham Forest on Monday night, including team news.\nVilla are set to be without Ludwig Augustinsson after the defender was sidelined for three weeks with a hamstring injury sustained in the goalless draw at 10-man Leeds last weekend.\nThe visitors are unbeaten in their last three fixtures and Gerrard has demanded his squad continue to improve in order to move up from 14th in the table.\nThe Villa boss, who expects Matty Cash and Calum Chambers to return from injury on Monday, added: \u201cThere\u2019s been an improvement, but what I will say is we need to keep striving for more improvement and better results.\n\u201cI felt as if the weekend was a missed opportunity to take maximum points, not just on the back of them going down to 10 men, but on the back of the opportunities we created. We did enough to win that game.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got another opportunity against Forest to go away and try and build on our recent performances and try to get an away win. If we do, we\u2019ll creep closer to where we want to be.\n\u201cRecent performances have given us a platform but there\u2019s no one on the inside at Villa who thinks we\u2019re there.

The pair had tested positive for Covid-19 last week but both returned negative tests on Friday after their mandatory five day-isolation ended.\nGermany international M\u00fcller, however, was still having some cold-like symptoms, Bayern coach Julian Nagelsmann said on Friday.\n\u201cBoth are (Covid-19) free but Thomas still has some cold-like symptoms and he won\u2019t be in the squad. It is still too early for him to travel with us. He is not 100%,\u201d Nagelsmann said. \u201cJosh does not feel anything and all his values are high. We will wait for the last training and see what makes sense after five days. I assume he will travel with us.\u201d\nBayern are in third place in the Bundesliga on 15 points as many as fourth-placed Dortmund. Union Berlin and Freiburg lead the title race on 17. Nagelsmann will also have France winger Kingsley Coman back after a month out with a hamstring injury.\n\n\u201cHe is fit and he overcame the stress tests. He is not a candidate to start ... but he can play 30 or 40 minutes.\u201d Both teams are going into Der Klassiker with midweek wins in the Champions League group stage. Bayern beat Viktoria Plzen 5-0 while Dortmund earned a 4-1 away win at Sevilla. \n\u201cDortmund are a good team. They added some good players, lost some good ones too but they built a good team,\u201d Nagelsmann said. \u201cEspecially when they defend deep and they can then hit you on the break. We saw that against Sevilla. They are playing a good season and it will be a good game. But what is important is that we are winners in the end,\u201d he added.

Berlin was gripped by a winter the like of which I\u2019d never experienced before, and things were equally bleak on the pitch. We were colossally, spectacularly hungover from the night before, and the temperature on matchday peaked at a balmy -12; I\u2019m not sure the sun rose at all that day.\n\u201cOur stag \u2013 rather ill-advisedly dressed as Jurgen Klinsmann \u2013 had been harassed by some local ne\u2019er-do-wells on the way to the ground, taking exception to his outfit and mistaken in their belief that he was, underneath the blonde wig, actually Turkish. Inside the half-empty ground, our hair-of-the-dog beers froze before we could drink them; we resorted to taking turns with a penknife to chisel shards from the ice. Some of party took to doing shuttle runs up and down the stairs in at attempt to stay warm. Others \u2013 having managed to drink enough beer-popsicle to require a visit to the facilities \u2013 didn\u2019t come back for the second half; we afterwards discovered that they\u2019d found a lukewarm water-pipe in the bowels of the stadium and clustered round it for protection from the cold.\n\u201cMatters on the pitch were trivial in the face of the weather, but for the record - and to the surprise of absolutely no-one - the game finished 0-0. I recall almost nothing as almost nothing happened. I don\u2019t believe there was a single effort on target, and that includes the late Gladbach penalty which was scuffed harmlessly and pathetically wide.\u201d\n\n\nUpdated at 11.49am BST\n\n\n 11.37am  \n\nHere\u2019s the original \u201cMy least favourite game\u201d for those needing:\n\n\n\n\n 11.35am  \n\nIn a continuation of our successful \u201cMy Least Favourite Game\u201d series \u2013 thanks to you, dear readers, for sending us your accounts of the worst experiences you\u2019ve had at the football:\n\n\n\n\n 11.32am  \n\nA bit more from Klopp, pouring praise on Mikel Arteta: \u201cReally, really good job \u2026 when you need some time nobody wants to give you time, and maybe not all of us deserve time, you have to be good to use the time \u2026 I have to say really lots of respect [for the job Arteta has done] \u2026 I spoke to [Martin] \u00d8degaard when he was 15 and when the whole world wanted him \u2026 he decided to go to Madrid.

This is from PA Media:\nNewcastle boss Eddie Howe has insisted he put his faith in the Premier League\u2019s owners\u2019 and directors\u2019 test as he considered the club\u2019s offer of employment. Howe was offered the job of head coach by the Magpies\u2019 new Saudi-backed owners, who completed their takeover a year ago on Friday, prompting criticism as a result of the Gulf state\u2019s human rights record.\nHowever, asked if he understood why some people were uncomfortable with that, he said: \u201cYes, I do and I understand the question. But for me, the directors\u2019 and owners\u2019 test ratified by the Premier League, I have to have faith in that process. Obviously I\u2019ve been the decision-maker behind where some of that money has gone, and I\u2019ve looked at it purely from a football perspective trying to recruit the best players for Newcastle.\u201d\nAsked how he dealt with that focus on a day-to-day basis, Howe added: \u201cI\u2019ve said this right from day one - it\u2019s always about the football for me. If I veer too far from that and I go into areas of the club that won\u2019t benefit my players or the team, then I\u2019m not going to do my players justice. \u201cEverything for me is about trying to get the best out of the players that I have every single day, and hopefully that shows when we play. I\u2019ve never veered too far from that in my management career and I think that\u2019s vitally important for me.\u201d\n\nUpdated at 10.28am BST\n\n\n 10.07am  \n\nA minute\u2019s applause will take place before Tottenham\u2019s match at Brighton on Saturday in memory of fitness coach Gian Piero Ventrone.

                    "body": "A few days after naming themselves the \u201cWallabies\u201d and a few weeks before playing England in the first official Test between the nations in 1908, the Australian national team lost a beloved member of the squad: Bertie the carpet snake, who had spent six weeks at sea and been smuggled into England down the strides of backrower Tom Richards, died an hour before kick off. Bad mouse, apparently. So when Edgar Mobbs, the powerful English winger crossed the stripe two minutes into that first Test on 9 January, it was just another slap in the face for Australians in an era when British rugby fans derided them not as Wallabies but as \u201cRabbits\u201d. Little wonder flanker Norman Row celebrated with cartwheels after his kick and chase sparked a 9-3 Australian victory that day.  It was the start of a beautiful rivalry that has now reached 52 Tests, with honours pretty much even. England have won 26, Australia 25, with one draw in 1997. However, the stat that matters most for Dave Rennie\u2019s Wallabies side is that England have won 12 of the last 14 since 2010, including eight straight under the coaching of Eddie Jones. The Wallabies are England\u2019s \u201cRabbits\u201d once more. The 23-man Wallabies side selected on Thursday has the flair, firepower and experience to succeed. With Michael Hooper leading the horns and Quade Cooper conducting the strings, Australia has both perspiration and inspiration covered. There are two debutantes \u2013 Caderyn Neville and David Porecki \u2013 but they are 33 and 29 respectively. Rob Leota and Noah Lolesio have played only six and nine Tests but are in red-hot form. Hooper and James Slipper have 118 and 114 Tests with no loss of vigour. There are weapons up front. No 8 Rob Valetini has been the leading forward in Super Rugby and, at 23, is coming into his prime. Neville has waited a decade for this moment and will not let it slip. He and partner Darcy Swain stand two metres tall and are renowned ball-carriers through the middle, masters of the rolling maul that served the Brumbies so well this year. Hooper is a lionheart at the ruck and a dervish in open play. He will show blindside colleague Rob Leota to embrace the collision. Angus Bell is a rock \u2013 just 21 but 16 Tests already. And there are weapons out wide. Marika Koriebete is the reigning John Eales medal winner and returns fresh from Japan after a wrecking ball performance leading Panasonic to a League One title. Len Ikitau and Samu Kerevi\u2019s centre partnership is now 10 Tests old and was key in the Wallabies\u2019 two victories over world champions South Africa last season. They will monster an England backline missing centres Manu Tuilagi and Henry Slade to injury. Halfback Nic White has spurned overseas offers and beaten off the challenge of younger rival Tate McDermott to marshal the pack again. But there are weaknesses too. England will pump the sidelines and expose Australia\u2019s lineout, leaving Porecki, a Waratah, throwing to two Brumbies in Swain and Neville. Bell is a target at the set piece, having given away 18 penalties in Super Rugby this year, mostly for scrum collapses. Ill-discipline will kill any Wallaby momentum and court death by a thousand kicks from Owen Farrell who nailed 23 from 26 attempts in 2016 to lead the whitewash, despite Australia scoring more tries in two of three Tests. And in Freddie Steward, England have a leaper. Against France in the Six Nations, England peppered the corners regularly for their towering back. Jones is sure to replicate the tactic, particularly with Australia\u2019s best aerial expert Jordan Petaia on the bench and fullback Tom Banks yet to nail down the No 15 jersey. Perhaps that\u2019s why Rennie has picked specialist winger Andrew Kellaway, a nominee for World Rugby rookie of the year in 2021 after nine tries in the internationals, and a calm head.  Australian rugby is hurting. Nineteen seasons without winning the Bledisloe Cup, 22 years without raising the Webb Ellis World Cup trophy and six years and eight games without a win over England. For a proud sporting nation, it\u2019s not good enough. Many rugby fans have stopped wearing the gold jersey, and many sponsors have stopped believing in it. There may well be a golden decade coming for the code\u2019s administrators with home soil World Cups, Lions tours and Commonwealth and Olympic Games, but none of it matters if the Wallabies aren\u2019t winning.  With a 40% win rate from his 20 Tests, Rennie badly needs to hold this inaugural Mobbs-Ella Trophy. Will he storm the enemy\u2019s machine gun nest as Mobbs did at Ypres in 1917 and pass into everlasting glory? Or will we calmly cast the net for mullet as Ella did in his boyhood, some hidden force leaving the sea and becoming a flash of hands and a breath of magic that too briefly stunned the rugby world.  It\u2019s a crossroads. Win and the path is a brick road of Wallaby gold, a ramp to a World Cup title shot. Fall to the old foe again and a thousand miles of bad road lies ahead, all littered with dead rabbits."

                    "body": "The England captain Courtney Lawes is set to see a specialist to determine whether he will play again this season after sustaining a \u201cnasty\u201d hand injury, Northampton\u2019s director of rugby, Chris Boyd, has revealed. Lawes sustained a compound dislocation of his left thumb in the European Challenge Cup quarter\u2011final defeat by Gloucester last Saturday and was replaced after just 15 minutes. Boyd did not put any sort of time-frame on the 33-year-old\u2019s recovery, stating only that he will definitely not be in contention for the Premiership match against Bath on Saturday.  His short-term absence is a blow for Northampton, who are chasing a top-four spot and a prolonged spell on the sidelines could hinder their push for the playoffs. England\u2019s three-Test tour of Australia this summer is also coming into view and Eddie Jones, the head coach, will be desperate to have Lawes fit and firing, given he has captained the national side five times this term in Owen Farrell\u2019s absence. When asked if Lawes would be back before the end of the season, Boyd said: \u201cThe hand specialist will come back and say X, Y or Z and whatever he says will happen. I\u2019m not sure whether a scan will determine that but he certainly needs specialist consultation to see what the best course of action is going forward. \u201cIt [the injury] was quite nasty. The bone actually came out, but it either popped back in or it was put back in and it has been irrigated and sewn back up again. He has still got some medical decisions to be made around the skeletal function of the thumb and the muscle and ligament situation. \u201cUntil we get a clear medical view, all I can say is he won\u2019t play on Saturday. He came into training today. He was disappointed. He didn\u2019t want to look at it because he knew it was going to be a bit challenging. He\u2019s as good as can be.\u201d Lawes has already had an interrupted season, having missed the first two games of England\u2019s disappointing Six Nations campaign because of a problem with his vestibular system, symptoms of which included headaches and \u201chead\u2011rush\u201d, which kept him out of action for six weeks. He returned to captain England in the narrow win against Wales, however, and counting in his favour Jones at the time referred to Lawes as someone who \u201ctends to play pretty well fresh on to the paddock\u201d."

                    "body": "Caroline Dennett\u2019s eye was caught by a placard with two stark words: \u201cinsiders wanted\u201d. The safety consultant was watching a video of Extinction Rebellion climate protesters who had glued themselves inside Shell\u2019s headquarters in April and were encouraging employees to jump ship to aid its cause.\nThis week Dennett, who runs the independent agency Clout, released a bombshell video severing ties with Shell after an 11-year business relationship. She emailed 1,400 Shell employees and accused the \u00a3177bn behemoth of causing \u201cextreme harms\u201d to the environment and having a \u201cdisregard for climate change risks\u201d.\nShe believes Shell is failing to wind down its polluting fossil fuels business and urged its employees to \u201cwalk away while there\u2019s still time\u201d. She acknowledged that she was \u201cprivileged\u201d in being able to make the choice to cut ties.\nSpeaking to the Guardian, she says support for her decision has flooded in from clients and people all over the world. Her cause may have been helped by the fact Shell has made outsized profits from the energy crisis, hitting its public image and fuelling calls for a windfall tax, which has now been introduced.\n\nA lone troll told her: \u201cYou have taken the money and now you have run, you princess.\u201d\nDennett\u2019s mic drop video was the culmination of a growing sense of unease in working with the 115-year-old company. Her relationship with Shell began in the aftermath of BP\u2019s Deepwater Horizon disaster as the industry scrambled to tighten up safety procedures.\nShe studied the lessons from the Gulf of Mexico, and other tragedies, including poor handovers and pressure to take shortcuts. Clout then designed a bespoke survey for frontline workers, managers and contractors. Since then, her work has taken her to an old gas plant at Jumping Pound in Alberta, Canada, and to Qatar and Trinidad. Her in-depth studies question employees on safety processes, their training, resources and whether managers trust them to be given responsibility. She has completed several such large studies for Shell, as well as other clients in oil and gas and unconnected industries.\nAt the same time, Dennett had become increasingly engaged in climate activism. She has spent time addressing councils and schools around Dorset \u2013 she lives in Weymouth \u2013 leading debates and encouraging local action, such as installing solar panels on village halls.\n\u201cI\u2019d find myself asking councils to take their money out of fossil fuels but then admitting I work in the industry and need to do this myself. We\u2019re all hypocrites to some extent but this was starting to feel ridiculous,\u201d she says.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s clear from working with the frontline employees at Shell is that net zero is just not talked about internally. It simply never comes up where issues like safety and tensions with local communities do,\u201d she says.\nBut is it fair to expect an oil-rig worker to be engaged in their employer\u2019s overarching corporate strategy? \u201cYes. If it was embedded in the company you would be hearing it discussed all the time. They are experts in managing risk but are not managing the climate risk,\u201d she says.\nThe strength of feeling about Shell\u2019s impact on the environment was underscored the day after Dennett\u2019s video was released. At the company\u2019s annual shareholder meeting at Methodist Central Hall in London, Extinction Rebellion protesters banged drums and shouted: \u201cShell must fall\u201d as people filed in.\nInside, protesters delayed the meeting by nearly three hours by shouting, and singing \u201cwe will stop you\u201d to the tune of Queen\u2019s 1977 hit We Will Rock You. The executive team sat still, stony faced, watching on while the chairman, Sir Andrew Mackenzie, tried to placate the protesters. \u201cIt was amazing. Singing at the board, you can\u2019t get any more non-violent direct action than that,\u201d Dennett says.\nHer decision to snub Shell comes at a price \u2013 \u201caround 60%-70% of my business\u201d, she admits. There\u2019s also the possibility of legal action from Shell.\n\nIt\u2019s a business she built after an unlikely journey. She was born in Merthyr Tydfil, south Wales; her father fitted industrial piping and her mother worked in a leisure centre. After studying criminal justice and later marketing, she worked in social services, including a psychiatric hospital. Six years in the Netherlands followed, working first for a nascent satnav developer and then for the camera company Canon. She then worked for research agencies before setting up Clout.\nSo what would be the dream reaction to her very public display of dissent? \u201cThat Shell would wake up and use all of the skill, capital, the human power to genuinely transition. They were a pioneering company that had a vision. They do not have a vision now. It\u2019s a take take take vision. All they can think of is to continue what they have been doing. To the executives, I say: take a look at yourself in the mirror.\u201d\nShell said more than 75% of the \u00a320bn to \u00a325bn it intends to spend in the UK over the next decade is in low and zero carbon products and services. The company said: \u201cWe expect our energy transition spend to constitute 50% of our total spend by 2025.\u201d"

                    "body": "  8.49pm   Summary  It\u2019s nearly 4pm in Washington DC. Here is a round-up of today\u2019s developments on Trump\u2019s tax returns and more:   Despite Trump previously pledging that he would forgo his $400,000 salary if he became president, his tax returns indicate otherwise. According to Trump\u2019s tax returns, he reported $0 in charitable giving in 2020 - his last year in office. In 2017, Trump donated $1.8 million and approximately half a million dollars in 2018 and 2019 each. The Biden administration on Friday finalized regulations to protect hundreds of thousands of streams, wetlands and other waterways across the country. The new rules repeal a Trump-era rule federal courts threw out and environmentalists said left waterways vulnerable to pollution. In addition to listing China as a foreign country that had a Trump-tied bank account, Trump also listed business income, taxes and expenses in several other countries on his tax returns. Those include Israel, Mexico, United Arab Emirates, India, Qatar, Panama, Puerto Rico, the Philippines, South Korea and Brazil, among others. Texas Democratic representative Lloyd Doggett has responded to the release of Tump\u2019s tax returns, saying that \u201cAmericans should be outraged\u201d by how little the former president paid in federal taxes in recent years.\u201cI think it\u2019s really outrageous\u2026 Here is the most powerful man in the world, the self-described clever genius who brags of his wealth almost daily and he did not pay taxes that the most modest wage earner in this country would pay,\u201d he told MSNBC.  Daniel Goldman, now a congressman-elect from New York but in a former role lead Democratic counsel in Donald Trump\u2019s first impeachment, has a question about what the Trump tax returns released today show: \u201cTrump had bank accounts in China while he was in office until 2018. Generally, you only have bank accounts in a foreign country if you are doing transactions in that country\u2019s currency.\u201d President Joe Biden is granting full pardons to six people, the White House has announced. In a statement released on Friday, a White House spokesperson said that the pardons are for six individuals \u201cwho have served their sentences and have demonstrated a commitment to improving their communities and the lives of those around them.\u201d On Thursday, in a recount triggered by the closeness of the first count, the Democratic candidate for attorney general, Kris Mayes, was declared the winner for a second time, beating the Republican candidate, Abe Hamadeh. As the Associated Press reports, though, Mayes won the recount by less than she won the first count, finishing \u201c280 votes ahead \u2026 down from a lead of 511 in the original count [with] the reason for the discrepancy not immediately clear.\u201d Donald Trump\u2019s tax returns indicate that he held overseas bank accounts while he was president. One page of the returns indicate the United Kingdom, Ireland, China and Saint Martin as foreign countries where Trump\u2019s financial accounts were located. Tax records reviewed by the New York Times in 2020 revealed that Trump paid nearly $200,000 in taxes to China, according to the outlet. The House ways and means Republican leader Kevin Brady of Texas has responded to the release of Donald Trump\u2019s tax returns, calling it a a \u201cpolitical weapon\u201d and a \u201cregrettable stain.\u201d \u201cGoing forward, all future Chairs of both the House Ways and Means Committee and the Senate Finance Committee will have nearly unlimited power to target and make public the tax returns of private citizens, political enemies, business and labor leaders or even the Supreme Court justices themselves,\u201d he said.  Democratic representative Don Beyer of Virginia has compared Donald Trump to former president Richard Nixon in light of Trump\u2019s tax returns release. In a statement released on Friday regarding Trump\u2019s returns, Beyer, who sits on the House ways and means committee, said: \u201cDespite promising to release his tax returns, Donald Trump refused to do so, and abused the power of his office to block basic transparency on his finances and conflict of interest which no president since Nixon has foregone.\u201d Donald Trump has responded to the release of his tax returns by Democrats on the House ways and means committee, saying that they \u201cshow how proudly successful I have been\u201d. In a statement released by his campaign, Trump pushed back against the move, saying: \u201cThe Democrats should have never done it, the supreme court should have never approved it, and it\u2019s going to lead to horrible things for so many people.\u201d He continued: \u201cThe great USA divide will now grow far worse. The radical, left Democrats have weaponized everything, but remember, that is a dangerous two-way street!\u201d The release of Donald Trump\u2019s tax returns follows a congressional report released earlier this month that revealed that Trump and his wife Melania did not pay any federal income tax in 2020. The report also found for a few years, the couple reported negative income and little or no tax liability. In addition, it found that the Internal Revenue Service failed to carry out mandatory audits of Trump during his first two years as president. House Democrats have released former president Donald Trump\u2019s tax returns that span over six years. The release of the returns marks the latest blow for Trump who was impeached twice by the Democratic-led House and was later acquitted by the Senate. In a written statement, Representative Richard E. Neal of Massachusetts, the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee said, \u201cOur findings turned out to be simple \u2014 I.R.S. did not begin their mandatory audit of the former president until I made my initial request,\u201d the New York Times reports. An Arizona man who participated in the January 6 riots told the January 6th Select Committee that the \u201ccrazy\u201d conspiracy theories about him working with the government has deeply affected his life. In an interview released on Thursday, Ray Epps told the committee that he has received death threats and that his grandchildren were bullied at school following far-right conspiracy theories that he was working for the FBI.\u201cThe only time I\u2019ve been involved with the government was when I was a Marine in the United States Marine Corps,\u201d Epps, who was a supporter of Donald Trump, said. Donald Trump\u2019s former communications director has called Kayleigh McEnany, Trump\u2019s last White House press secretary a \u201cliar and an opportunist.\u201d According to testimony released on Thursday, Alyssa Farah Griffin was asked by the January 6th Select Committee where McEnany \u201cfell\u201d after the 2020 election. In response, Farah Griffin said, \u201cI\u2019m a Christian woman\u2026so I will say this. Kayleigh is a liar and an opportunist.\u201d  That\u2019s it from me, Maya Yang, as we end today\u2019s live blog on the politics of Capitol Hill and beyond. Have a great weekend!      8.15pm    Despite Trump previously pledging that he would forgo his $400,000 salary if he became president, his tax returns indicate otherwise. According to Trump\u2019s tax returns, he reported $0 in charitable giving in 2020 - his last year in office. In 2017, Trump donated $1.8 million and approximately half a million dollars in 2018 and 2019 each, the tax returns indicate.  Updated at 8.41pm GMT    7.38pm    The Biden administration on Friday finalized regulations to protect hundreds of thousands of streams, wetlands and other waterways across the country. The Associated Press reports:  The new rules repeal a Trump-era rule federal courts threw out and environmentalists said left waterways vulnerable to pollution. The rule defines which \u201cwaters of the United States\u201d are protected by the Clean Water Act. For decades, the term has been a flashpoint between environmental groups that want to broaden limits on pollution and farmers, builders and industry groups that say extending regulations too far is onerous for business. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Department of the Army said the reworked rule was based on definitions in place before 2015. Federal officials said they wrote a \u201cdurable definition\u201d of waterways to reduce uncertainty. More from the Associated Press here:   Updated at 8.50pm GMT    7.10pm    Here\u2019s some interesting lunchtime reading from Andrew Lawrence about Maxwell Frost, the Florida congressman-elect who is set to become the first Gen Z member of Congress. Safe to say, Frost\u2019s move to Washington has not proved entirely smooth sailing\u2026 When the Guardian last visited 25-year-old Maxwell Alejandro Frost, in September, he was campaigning to become the first Gen Z member of the US Congress, and driving Uber shifts to make ends meet in the meantime.   In early November he defeated his Republican rival, Calvin Wimbish, by a considerable margin, winning 59% of the vote in Florida\u2019s 10th congressional district, which includes Orlando and many of its surrounding theme parks. Frost\u2019s life has only become messier since. Chiefly, he has yet to sort out his living accommodation in Washington DC, and must decide whether to keep paying rent for the Orlando home he shares with two others, as well as working out how to foot these bills until his $174,000 (\u00a3142,000) federal salary kicks in.  He says: \u201cI\u2019ll probably crash on someone\u2019s couch in DC for the first month at least.\u201d Even finding potential roommates among his fellow representatives brings unforeseen challenges for the congressman-elect, who has been back and forth for freshman orientations.  \u201cA lot of people are looking to get their roommates before 3 January,\u201d says Frost. \u201cI just can\u2019t operate on that timeline. Even after I start getting paid it\u2019s not like I\u2019m flush in one day. I have a lot of debt.\u201d  Earlier this month he vented on Twitter about being turned down for a DC apartment due to bad credit: \u201cThis ain\u2019t meant for people who don\u2019t already have the money,\u201d he wrote. Read on:      6.46pm    In addition to listing China as a foreign country that had a Trump-tied bank account, Trump also listed business income, taxes and expenses in several other countries on his tax returns.  Those include Israel, Mexico, United Arab Emirates, India, Qatar, Panama, Puerto Rico, the Philippines, South Korea and Brazil, among others.  In response to the release, Democratic representative Raja Krishnamoorthi of Illinois tweeted:   \u201cReleasing six years\u2019 worth of Donald Trump\u2019s tax returns\u2026should help us understand any connections to foreign entities that may have influenced his decision-making as president.\u201d       6.19pm    Texas Democratic representative Lloyd Doggett has responded to the release of Tump\u2019s tax returns, saying that \u201cAmericans should be outraged\u201d by how little the former president paid in federal taxes in recent years.   \u201cI think it\u2019s really outrageous\u2026both with regard to Trump personally and with regard to Trump\u2019s Internal Revenue Service administration. Here is the most powerful man in the world, the self-described clever genius who brags of his wealth almost daily and he did not pay taxes that the most modest wage earner in this country would pay,\u201d Doggett told MSNBC.  \u201cNothing in one year, $75o dollars a year and others, all of this related to claims for big losses, big deductions, big credits, taking advantage of every loophole and because of the sorry job that Trump\u2019s IRS did, we don\u2019t know how many of these were legal loopholes, for the rich and how many of them were unjust and illegal\u201d he said, adding, \u201cAmericans should be outraged by that.\u201d        5.38pm    Daniel Goldman, now a congressman-elect from New York but in a former role lead Democratic counsel in Donald Trump\u2019s first impeachment, has a question about what the Trump tax returns released today show:  Trump had bank accounts in China while he was in office until 2018. Generally, you only have bank accounts in a foreign country if you are doing transactions in that country\u2019s currency.  What business was Trump doing in China while he was president?  On the subject of Republicans, China and investment arrangements, here\u2019s some further reading from the Guardian\u2019s Lloyd Green:      5.20pm    Our Washington bureau chief, David Smith, and Sam Levine have filed their first report on today\u2019s main politics news, the release of Donald Trump\u2019s tax returns. Six years of Donald Trump\u2019s tax returns were made public by a congressional panel on Friday, ending the former president\u2019s long-running effort to break precedent and keep them secret. The returns date from 2015 to 2020 and span nearly 6,000 pages, including more than 2,700 pages of individual returns from Trump and his wife, Melania, and more than 3,000 pages from Trump\u2019s businesses. Sensitive information such as social security and bank account numbers have been redacted. A House of Representatives report released earlier this month analyzed the documents and showed Trump and his wife Melania paid no federal income tax in 2020, the last full year he was in office. From 2015 to 2020, Donald and Melania Trump had several years in which they reported negative income and little or no tax liability. The report also found that the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) failed to conduct mandatory audits of Trump during his first two years in office. By contrast, there were audits of Joe Biden for the 2020 and 2021 tax years, according to the White House. Richard Neal, the Democratic chairman of the ways and means committee, said in a statement: \u201cA president is no ordinary taxpayer. They hold power and influence unlike any other American. And with great power comes even greater responsibility.\u201d He added: \u201cWe anticipated the IRS would expand the mandatory audit program to account for the complex nature of the former president\u2019s financial situation yet found no evidence of that. This is a major failure of the IRS under the prior administration, and certainly not what we had hoped to find.\u201d Full story:      5.04pm    President Joe Biden is granting full pardons to six people, the White House has announced. In a statement released on Friday, a White House spokesperson said that the pardons are for six individuals \u201cwho have served their sentences and have demonstrated a commitment to improving their communities and the lives of those around them.\u201d  \u201cPresident Biden believes America is a nation of second chances, and that offering meaningful opportunities for redemption and rehabilitation empowers those who have been incarcerated to become productive, law-abiding members of society,\u201d the statement added. \u201cThe President remains committed to providing second chances to individuals who have demonstrated their rehabilitation \u2013 something that elected officials on both sides of the aisle, faith leaders, civil rights advocates, and law enforcement leaders agree our criminal justice system should offer.\u201d  The pardoned group include individuals who served in the US military, survived domestic abuse, and volunteer in their communities.   Updated at 6.20pm GMT    4.36pm    More elections news from Arizona, a swing state where pro-Trump Republicans have of late caused a lot of trouble with claims of electoral fraud in races in which they were beaten. On Thursday, in a recount triggered by the closeness of the first count, the Democratic candidate for attorney general, Kris Mayes, was declared the winner for a second time, beating the Republican candidate, Abe Hamadeh. As the Associated Press reports, though, Mayes won the recount by less than she won the first count, finishing \u201c280 votes ahead \u2026 down from a lead of 511 in the original count [with] the reason for the discrepancy not immediately clear\u201d. In a statement, Mayes said she was \u201cexcited and ready to get to work as your next attorney general and vow to be your lawyer for the people\u201d. The AP continues:  \u201cOutside court, Mayes attorney Dan Barr said the results should give the public confidence in elections, despite the adjustments in vote totals as a result of the recount. \u2018They didn\u2019t just do a rubber stamp of what it was,\u2019 Barr said. \u2018They did a careful evaluation of the votes and they came up with a different result. And so I think people should have a lot of confidence in the process.\u2019 Hamadeh said the discrepancies in the latest results from his race were shockingly high. \u2018My legal team will be assessing our options to make sure every vote is counted,\u2019 he said. Hamadeh hasn\u2019t conceded to Mayes.  The Arizona governor\u2019s race was also close, but not close enough to trigger a recount. The Democratic candidate, Katie Hobbs, won it, by a little more than 17,000 votes. The Republican candidate \u2013 the pro-Trump election denier Kari Lake \u2013 went to court over her defeat, but lost. Some further reading:      4.11pm    Donald Trump\u2019s tax returns indicate that he held overseas bank accounts while he was president.  One page of the returns indicate the United Kingdom, Ireland, China and Saint Martin as foreign countries where Trump\u2019s financial accounts were located.   Tax records reviewed by the New York Times in 2020 revealed that Trump paid nearly $200,000 in taxes to China, according to the outlet.  During the 2020 presidential campaign, Trump accused his oppponent Joe Biden of being \u201cweak on China\u201d and claimed that the Biden family was \u201cselling out our country\u201d to China.      3.40pm    The House ways and means Republican leader Kevin Brady of Texas has responded to the release of Donald Trump\u2019s tax returns, calling it a a \u201cpolitical weapon\u201d and a \u201cregrettable stain.\u201d In a statement issued on Friday, Brady said:   \u201cWith the publicly released transcript of Democrats\u2019 secret executive session, Americans now have confirmation that there was never a legislative purpose behind the public release of these confidential records and that the IRS was conducting audits prior to Democrats\u2019 request. \u201cDespite these facts, Democrats have charged forward with an unprecedented decision to unleash a dangerous new political weapon that reaches far beyond the former president, overturning decades of privacy protections for average Americans that have existed since Watergate. \u201cGoing forward, all future Chairs of both the House Ways and Means Committee and the Senate Finance Committee will have nearly unlimited power to target and make public the tax returns of private citizens, political enemies, business and labor leaders or even the Supreme Court justices themselves. \u201cThis is a regrettable stain on the Ways and Means Committee and Congress, and will make American politics even more divisive and disheartening. In the long run, Democrats will come to regret it.\u201d      3.19pm    Democratic representative Don Beyer of Virginia has compared Donald Trump to former president Richard Nixon in light of Trump\u2019s tax returns release.  In a statement released on Friday regarding Trump\u2019s returns, Beyer, who sits on the House ways and means committee, said:   \u201cDespite promising to release his tax returns, Donald Trump refused to do so, and abused the power of his office to block basic transparency on his finances and conflict of interest which no president since Nixon has foregone.\u201d   Beyer went on to add:   \u201cTrump acted as though he had something to hide, a pattern consistent with the recent conviction of his family business for criminal tax fraud. As the public will now be able to see, Trump used questionable or poorly substantiated deductions and a number of other tax avoidance schemes as justification to pay little or no federal income tax in several of the years examined.\u201d       3.01pm   Trump responds to release of returns  Donald Trump has responded to the release of his tax returns by Democrats on the House ways and means committee, saying that they \u201cshow how proudly successful I have been\u201d. In a statement released by his campaign, Trump pushed back against the move, saying: \u201cThe Democrats should have never done it, the supreme court should have never approved it, and it\u2019s going to lead to horrible things for so many people.\u201d He continued: \u201cThe great USA divide will now grow far worse. The radical, left Democrats have weaponized everything, but remember, that is a dangerous two-way street! \u201cThe \u2018Trump\u2019 tax returns once again show how proudly successful I have been and how I have been able to use depreciation and various other tax deductions as an incentive for creating thousands of jobs and magnificent structures and enterprises.\u201d   Updated at 4.25pm GMT    2.40pm    The release of Donald Trump\u2019s tax returns follows a congressional report released earlier this month that revealed that Trump and his wife Melania did not pay any federal income tax in 2020. The report also found for a few years, the couple reported negative income and little or no tax liability. In addition, it found that the Internal Revenue Service failed to carry out mandatory audits of Trump during his first two years as president. For more details, read Sam Levine\u2019s reporting here:  Trump previously responded to the committee\u2019s decision to release his returns, calling it an \u201coutrageous abuse of power\u201d.  \u201cThere is no legitimate legislative purpose for their action. And if you look at what they\u2019ve done, it\u2019s so sad for our country,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cIt\u2019s nothing but another deranged political witch hunt which has been going on from the day I came down an escalator in Trump Tower.\u201d   Updated at 2.56pm GMT    2.12pm   House Democrats release Donald Trump's tax returns  House Democrats have released former president Donald Trump\u2019s tax returns that span over six years.  The release of the returns marks the latest blow for Trump who was impeached twice by the Democratic-led House and was later acquitted by the Senate.  In a written statement, Representative Richard E. Neal of Massachusetts, the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee said, \u201cOur findings turned out to be simple \u2014 I.R.S. did not begin their mandatory audit of the former president until I made my initial request,\u201d the New York Times reports. Stay tuned for more details as we review the returns.      1.52pm    An Arizona man who participated in the January 6 riots told the January 6th Select Committee that the \u201ccrazy\u201d conspiracy theories about him working with the government has deeply affected his life.  In an interview released on Thursday, Ray Epps told the committee that he has received death threats and that his grandchildren were bullied at school following far-right conspiracy theories that he was working for the FBI.   \"The only time I\u2019ve been involved with the government was when I was a Marine in the United States Marine Corps,\u201d Epps, who was a supporter of Donald Trump, said.    \u201cWe had a tour bus come by our home and our business with all these whacked out people in it\u2026There are good people out there that was in Washington. Those aren\u2019t the people that\u2019s coming by our house. This attracts \u2014 when they do this sort of thing, this attracts all the crazies out there,\u201d he added.   In his interview, Epps identified Republican representatives including Kentucky\u2019s Thomas Massie, Florida\u2019s Matt Gaetz and Georgia\u2019s Marjorie Taylor Greene as congress members who helped spread the conspiracy theories about him.   \u201cI mean, it\u2019s real crazy stuff, and [Massie] brought that kind of stuff to the floor of the House. When that happened, it just blew up. It got really, really bad\u2026Him and, gosh, Gaetz and Greene, and, yeah, they\u2019re just blowing this thing up. So it got really, really difficult after that. The crazies started coming out of the woodwork.\u201d      1.30pm    Donald Trump\u2019s former communications director has called Kayleigh McEnany, Trump\u2019s last White House press secretary a \u201cliar and an opportunist.\u201d According to testimony released on Thursday, Alyssa Farah Griffin was asked by the January 6th Select Committee where McEnany \u201cfell\u201d after the 2020 election. In response, Farah Griffin said, \u201cI\u2019m a Christian woman\u2026so I will say this. Kayleigh is a liar and an opportunist.\u201d Farah Griffin went on to add that McEnany was a \u201csmart woman\u201d and \u201cnot an idiot.\u201d  \u201cShe knew we lost the election, but she made a calculation that she wanted to have a certain life post-Trump that required staying in his good graces. And that was more important to her than telling the truth to the American public.\u201d  For more details on Farah Griffin\u2019s testimony, check out Martin Pengelly\u2019s reporting here:   Updated at 1.53pm GMT    1.12pm   House of Representatives set to release Trump tax returns  Good morning, Guardian readers! The House ways and means committee is scheduled to release the former president\u2019s tax returns today, after the panel\u2019s vote last week. The documents are expected to include Trump\u2019s tax returns from 2015 to 2021 and will be the first formal release of his financial records from his time as president. Last month, the Democrat-controlled committee obtained the returns as part of an investigation into Trump\u2019s taxes, following a lengthy court battle that resulted in the supreme court ruling in the committee\u2019s favor. The committee\u2019s report released last week revealed its findings that the Internal Revenue Service broke its own rules by not auditing Trump for three of the four years of his presidency. As a presidential candidate in 2016, Trump broke decades of precedent by refusing to release his tax returns. We will be bringing you the latest updates surrounding the release, so stay tuned.  "

                    "body": "Huddersfield Giants can \u201cput the town on the map\u201d if they win the Challenge Cup for the first time since 1953 this weekend. The Giants face Wigan Warriors in Saturday\u2019s final at Tottenham, their first major final since 2009 and the first under the stewardship of Ian Watson, who has his own personal score to settle along with several members of his squad.\nWatson and the likes of Tui Lolohea and the Giants\u2019 captain, Luke Yates, were part of the most surreal final in history in 2020, when Salford narrowly fell short against Leeds Rhinos inside an empty Wembley Stadium due to the Covid-19 pandemic. With Huddersfield Town bidding for promotion to the Premier League 24 hours later, the Giants are one half of a momentous weekend of sport for the West Yorkshire town.\n\nAnd Yates insists it is a chance to ensure Huddersfield are considered as a force in rugby league once again after decades in the shadows. \u201cThe whole town is going to be down in London pretty much, so it\u2019s up to us to start the weekend off right,\u201d he said. \u201cWe can put the town on the map but from our own perspective, it\u2019s a chance to do something historic. It\u2019s long overdue for this club, nearly 70 years without a trophy, so it\u2019s time to make some history.\u201d\nHuddersfield full-back Lolohea was also part of the Salford squad that lost 17-16 to Leeds in 2020. \u201cIt was a surreal day,\u201d he admitted. \u201cPlaying in a final is supposed to be one of the best days of your career but it ended up being one of the worst given the result and the fact it was empty, and my family weren\u2019t there. You do wonder if you\u2019ll ever get another chance to do it properly, so to speak, so to have this chance is something we aren\u2019t taking for granted.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a chance to put 2020 right for a few of us but there\u2019s also a chance to get out there and bring success to Huddersfield after so long.\u201d\nLolohea is likely to start at full-back despite the talented youngster, Will Pryce, finishing a 10-match ban in time to return for the final. Pryce could deputise at half-back for the injured Theo Fages, while Wigan \u2013 bidding to win the cup for a 20th time \u2013 could bring their captain, Thomas Leuluai, back into their squad for the game at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium as he nears a return from injury."

                    "body": "Liverpool v Real Madrid will be decided by the finest margins, so it is good news that J\u00fcrgen Klopp has one of the finest forward lines in Europe available to him. Whichever combination he picks would be top-class but I think he will select a front three of Mohamed Salah, Sadio Man\u00e9 and Luis D\u00edaz.\nSalah has unfinished business after being forced off early on with a shoulder injury the last time these teams met in a Champions League final in 2018. That will be a powerful influence on a player who, after a long season, needs to find a last bit of energy in the hope of securing another trophy.\n\nIf you look at modern goalscorers such as Salah or Son Heung-min, who shared this season\u2019s Golden Boot, they are not centre-forwards, they are wide players who come off the flanks to score. Salah is a gamechanger who can turn it on at a moment\u2019s notice and make the difference. When I watched him in the semi-final first leg against Villarreal, he was quiet for 85 minutes but in the five minutes when they earned the 2-0 lead he was pivotal. He\u2019s like a PlayStation player \u2013 as soon as you press the forward button, he just gets on with it.\nD\u00edaz has been really good since arriving from Porto in January. He has brought a different dynamic to the Liverpool attack and should rightly start in Paris. The Colombian has the pace and freshness that will make him a threat. At Villarreal he changed the game and he will be confident he can do likewise on Saturday. The winger has pushed Man\u00e9 into a more central role where he has been highly impressive, scoring 13 goals since returning in February from the Africa Cup of Nations.\nPlaying against D\u00edaz may suit Madrid more than if Liverpool used Roberto Firmino as a false 10, which would allow Man\u00e9 to go back to a wide area and enable Salah to play even wider in the buildup phase. Man\u00e9 and Salah could be even more effective there but I would be surprised if Klopp made a change for the final.\n\nLiverpool may face a team who will happily sit deep and be compact, like they were against Chelsea and Manchester City at times. Liverpool will want to have Thiago Alc\u00e2ntara fit because he is key in midfield when it comes to finding gaps in defences. If Thiago cannot start there will be more emphasis on getting players into the wider areas. Jordan Henderson will move wider, Naby Ke\u00efta will try to break through the lines and Fabinho will be in that pocket protecting the defence.\nIf they sit deep Henderson will look to create overloads out wide, allowing spaces for Trent Alexander-Arnold and Salah down the right. I think Liverpool will try to work down the flanks but with Thiago they can go centrally as well. It would be a huge miss for them if he cannot play or is fit enough only for, say, 20 minutes. In this type of game, they need him.\n\nDiogo Jota and Firmino have not let anyone down this season and could be set for a crucial role. The two forwards have the capabilities to come off the bench and make a difference. In recent times we have seen how many major matches have gone the distance, from the FA Cup final to England\u2019s penalty shootout loss to Italy at Euro 2020. Substitutes can play a massive part: if it is 0-0 you need them to come on and open things up; if you are losing you need them to change it; and if you\u2019re winning you need the momentum to carry on in the right way.\nLiverpool\u2019s forwards have impressed all season but their most important player is Virgil van Dijk. He is their most valuable asset. Salah, Man\u00e9 and Thiago rightly get a lot of plaudits but if I were to take one player from the Liverpool team, I would take Van Dijk. He will need to be at his best because Liverpool will have to keep Karim Benzema quiet. When I watched Real Madrid at Chelsea, it was a one-man Benzema show. He is the best player I\u2019ve seen live in 18 months.\n\nToni Kroos, Luka Modric and Casemiro in midfield will not want to get in a running battle because they will lose. But Madrid will hope their defensive structure will allow Rodrygo and, most likely, Vin\u00edcius J\u00fanior to break with pace and turn Liverpool.\nWhen I have watched Real they have really surprised me; they lure you into a false sense of security where you think they are not interested or they are not in the game but then all of a sudden they turn it on. I am not sure whether they can sense a little pressure and just change gear but it is an incredible skill to have. They are not dominant for 90 minutes but they just do it when they have to. You can never rule them out.\nLiverpool will not want to miss out on the Premier League by a point and follow it up with a Champions League final defeat because that would turn a potentially great season into only a good one. Luckily for them they have players who can make the difference in Paris. It is up to them to rise to the occasion."

                    "body": "Good morning. Well, at least one Tory kept her counsel yesterday. Perhaps resting ahead of the most important speech of her life, Liz Truss spent most of Tuesday at Conservative conference refusing to say things: look at the Google news results if you don\u2019t believe me.  She refused to say benefits will rise in line with inflation; she refused to say whether there would be more U-turns on the mini-budget; she squeezed in a bit of refusing to say whether she stopped King Charles III going to Cop27. Did she trust Kwasi Kwarteng? Liz Truss refused to say. (A little later, she concluded that she did.) If all that was meant as a model of reticence for her Conservative colleagues, it didn\u2019t turn out to be as effective as she might have hoped. Everyone else in her party decided that, on balance, they would say things. Angry things. A spittle-flecked ton of them. I\u2019m not sure, in fact, that so many angry things have ever been said by so many Tories about each other in a single day. And as Truss prepares for her big moment this morning, in which she will attack the \u201canti-growth coalition\u201d raging against her plans for the country, it is impossible to escape the conclusion that she\u2019s really talking about her own MPs. So. Today\u2019s newsletter \u2013 which comes with apologies that it\u2019s a few minutes late - will take you through the ten most jaw-dropping blue-on-blue attacks of the last 24 hours, in ascending order of untrammeled fury. It wasn\u2019t easy to pick, but journalism is a solemn duty. Here are the headlines. Five big stories  Police | Chris Kaba was not a suspect and was being followed by a police car without lights or sirens before he was shot dead by a firearms officer, an inquest into his death has been told. In the aftermath of the incident, the Metropolitan police said Kaba had been shot \u201cafter a vehicle pursuit\u201d. Twitter | Elon Musk has offered to complete his proposed $44bn (\u00a338bn) acquisition of Twitter in a dramatic U-turn on his decision to walk away from the deal. Energy | Liz Truss\u2019s intervention to freeze energy prices for households for two years is expected to cost the government \u00a389bn, according to the first major costing of the policy by the sector\u2019s leading consultancy. Iran | Iranian authorities have arrested Shervin Hajipour, one of Iran\u2019s most popular musicians, after a protest song he recorded went viral and became the soundtrack to the biggest civil uprising for decades. Yesterday\u2019s newsletter had a broken link to a story from Iran. Here is the correct link to a story about Iranian students stepping up their protests in defiance of a crackdown. Wagatha Christie | Rebekah Vardy will have to pay Colleen Rooney roughly \u00a31.5m after losing another stage in her libel trial. Vardy will also have to pay her own legal costs, which may bring her bill to well over \u00a33m.  In depth: The most furious Tories - ranked!  The Tories assembled in Birmingham are fighting over lots of things. They\u2019re fighting over the 45p tax U-turn, and the prospect of a swingeing benefit cut, and whether or not it\u2019s OK for the Home Secretary to accuse backbenchers of mounting a coup. But above all, deep down, they\u2019re mostly fighting about whether the prime minister has got what it takes.  Some of them are angrily making headlines by saying exactly what they bloody well think; others are angrily making headlines by telling the first lot to put a sock in it. The mood is a little delirious. An amazing video appeared yesterday of at least three people appearing to sleep soundly through health secretary Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Coffey\u2019s speech in the main hall, but this morning I find myself wondering if they weren\u2019t obscure backbenchers who somebody\u2019d poisoned.  It\u2019s impossible to be comprehensive after a day like that \u2013 although a Twitter user by the name of Hairy Politics has had a good go, with an increasingly baroque series of diagrams of who\u2019s attacking who which featured 21 names at 3.10pm and 33 by 8.30. (It did include figures like \u2018Steve Baker of Christmas Past\u2019, admittedly.) To make the below list, then, is a badge of honour. Commiserations to education minister Andrea Jenkyns, whose attack on Harry Potter degrees was easily wild enough to feature, but was disqualified because they don\u2019t actually exist, and Harry Potter probably isn\u2019t a member of the Tory party. *** 10 Anonymous MPs and party sources Plenty of fear and loathing from unnamed insiders yesterday, of course. \u201cI would rather see Keir Starmer in No 10 than this Conservative party,\u201d one MP says in this excellent read from Aubrey Allegretti, Pippa Crerar and Jessica Elgot. \u201cThis is the kind of chaos you only see at the end of a premiership \u2013 it\u2019s impossible for her to recover,\u201d says a former cabinet minister. \u201cThe trouble is there are so many bastards in the party,\u201d a minister told the Daily Mail. \u201cMichael Gove is an absolute snake,\u201d a party insider told the Telegraph. As she recovered from the day last night, Jess added on WhatsApp that a former minister had fretted that the party now has the \u201closer brain worms\u201d. All good stuff, but \u2013 sorry folks \u2013 on a day of such riches, you\u2019ll need to put your name on it if you want to get higher than tenth. *** 9 Michael Gove The aforementioned absolute snake \u2013 who has done \u201cmore gigs than Ed Sheeran\u201d at party conference, Marina Hyde wrote \u2013 would be higher, but his most vicious and consequential intervention was that which helped do for the 45p tax cut policy in an interview on Sunday. Yesterday he confined himself to the pointed observation that the party should reflect the ideas which Boris Johnson won on in 2019. In more normal times, such a clear repudiation of the party\u2019s direction of travel from a former senior minister would be news in itself. *** 8 Robert Buckland Asked what he thought of interventions by Gove and former chief whip Julian Smith (who, among other interventions in the last few weeks, at one point summarised his position as \u201cArghhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh\u201d), the former Welsh secretary said: \u201cI think it would be better for many colleagues to keep their own counsel.\u201d \u201cRobert Buckland says shut up,\u201d said interviewer Jon Sopel. \u201cYeah,\u201d he replied. *** 7 Kemi Badenoch The first serving cabinet minister on our list had a few choice words for another one, Suella Braverman, who accused Gove and others of staging a \u201ccoup\u201d over the top rate of income tax. After first joining with Braverman by having a go at backbenchers \u201ctrying to lob grenades at the PM\u201d, she then turned to the home secretary: \u201c\u2018I don\u2019t think we should be talking about coups,\u201d she said, \u201cI think that sort of a language is just too inflammatory.\u201d  *** 6 Penny Mordaunt The former leadership candidate \u2013 and another cabinet member, who, let\u2019s remember, are supposed to be bound by collective responsibility \u2013 carefully rubbished the idea of cutting benefits. It \u201cmakes sense\u201d that they should rise in line with inflation not pay, she said: \u201cWe\u2019re not about trying to help people with one hand and take it away with another.\u201d Truss was said to be furious with Mordaunt, the leader of the Commons, but her intervention reveals the risks inherent in Truss\u2019 insistence that no decision has yet been made on the issue: until one is, ministers can attack the idea without specifically contradicting the government. *** 5 Simon Clarke Clarke\u2019s intervention was relatively modest: it came in the form of a single tweet saying that Suella Braverman \u201cspeaks a lot of good sense\u201d. Which would be a perfectly normal thing to say about a fellow cabinet minister \u2013 except that the quotes from Braverman he was approving of were the one about a coup, and one about her \u201cdisappointment\u201d at the 45p U-turn. So that\u2019s another cabinet minister, one said to be one of Truss\u2019s most intense loyalists, suggesting the government has got it wrong \u2013 and accusing backbenchers of insurrection. *** 4 Lord Frost Another attack from a Truss loyalist. Lord Frost told LBC that the government is \u201cdoing the right thing in trying to set a new direction\u201d. But he also said the government had made \u201cunnecessary political errors\u201d, looked \u201crather weak\u201d, had made \u201cavoidable mistakes\u201d, and had gone about the whole thing in an \u201camateurish, bungling way\u201d. The only loyalist who says things like that about me is my mother, and at least she\u2019s not giving radio interviews about it. *** 3 Grant Shapps, unchained Now we\u2019re into the real big guns. Told about Buckland\u2019s demand that people like him \u201cshut up\u201d in a remarkable interview with the News Agents podcast yesterday, he had a subtle go at Buckland for switching from Sunak to Truss in the leadership contest, suggested that he \u201capplies the same to himself\u201d, and said he was simply \u201cspeaking truth to power\u201d. He also implied that Truss had brought his attacks on herself \u201cby sacking me\u201d, and said she had 10 days to save her premiership. Quite often, he ended his obvious attacks on Truss by saying he was \u201ccheering her on\u201d. Lol. *** 2 Nadine Dorries At one point yesterday, Nadine Dorries drew on her gifts as a writer to say dreamily that the Tories\u2019 poll deficit under Boris Johnson would have \u201cburned away like a morning mist on a summer\u2019s lawn.\u201d The rest of it was a little blunter. She sent two tweets confirming her view of Monday that if Truss wants to turn away from Johnson\u2019s programme for government, she needs \u201ca fresh mandate\u201d \u2013 which clearly refers to another election. (Shapps, incidentally, said that those sorts of bold demands were all very well for someone like Dorries, who has a substantial second income from her novels, but less attractive to the average backbencher.) All this would be remarkable under any circumstances \u2013 but all the more so from someone who said less than a month ago that she would \u201calways show [Truss] the same loyalty and support I have to Boris Johnson.\u201d *** 1 Suella Braverman  At one point yesterday, there were three separate stories about the home secretary on the MailOnline homepage; there\u2019s a massive picture of her on the front of today\u2019s Telegraph, approvingly describing her as a \u201ctrue blue\u201d. In part, that\u2019s because of the series of fierce views she espoused in her interview with the Telegraph yesterday \u2013 from claiming Britain has a \u201cbenefits street culture\u201d to saying that a Telegraph splash of a flight taking asylum seekers to Rwanda was \u201cmy dream, my obsession\u201d. But the most urgent part of her comments was that extraordinary reference to a backbench \u201ccoup\u201d against the prime minister, and a warning that MPs like Michael Gove should stop \u201cairing your dirty linen\u201d in public. Liz Truss will likely be hoping the same. Let\u2019s see how it goes.

                    "body": "The Thames, world-famous river through the heart of the British capital, without which London would not exist, half-tamed work of nature, inspiration to Dickens and the Kinks, to Monet and Wordsworth, along whose banks are strewn four Unesco world heritage sites, must surely deserve some love and care, some sort of vision or coherent overview. It is, as the architect Richard Rogers once said, \u201cprimarily a public space, not a private opportunity\u201d. It has indeed been the object of dreams and hopes. Yet over the past 15 years a proliferation of large developments has made it a gold-diggers\u2019 gulch, a miles-long mine of real-estate value. The latest of these is a \u00a3400m office-led proposal by the developers Mitsubishi Estate and CO-RE called 72 Upper Ground. It is situated on a privileged spot, where a bend in the river gives it exceptional prominence, alongside the publicly funded culture palaces of the South Bank and opposite the classical set piece of Somerset House. Its floor area of nearly 1m square feet is 20% more than that of the Gherkin, its height of 109 metres is slightly lower than St Paul\u2019s Cathedral. It would replace a much smaller 1970s tower that was used by ITV: the new building would have 225% of its floor area and add nearly 30% to its height.  There\u2019s not much evidence for the claims by its architects, Make, that its blocky design has \u201chuman scale\u201d and is \u201ccontextual\u201d with its surroundings. \u201cUgly, overblown and completely out of context,\u201d says the local objector Michael Ball, \u201cwhile casting homes into gloom.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s just greedy,\u201d says Kate Hoey, now Baroness Hoey, until 2019 the MP for the constituency in which it stands. It will cause a \u201csubstantial degree of unnecessary harm\u201d, according to her successor, Florence Eshalomi. Despite which the planning committee of the London borough of Lambeth voted 6-1 to give it planning permission, a decision then nodded through by mayor Sadiq Khan. Only a public inquiry, opening next week, and a ministerial verdict that will follow it, can prevent it being built. Most of all, the proposal looks random, the product of no particular plan or logic beyond a desire to put as much profitable volume as possible on its site. In this it is not alone, just an extreme example of a series of projects from the borough of Wandsworth in south-west London, via the land surrounding the listed pile that is Battersea power station, the former industrial zones of Nine Elms and Vauxhall, Waterloo, the South Bank and down to the old dock areas of the Isle of Dogs. 72 Upper Ground is a distillation of commercial and political attitudes that have radically changed the Thames.  This transformation owes much to the interests and expediencies of the boroughs that govern its banks, also to those of London mayors. The three holders of the office since it was inaugurated in 2000 \u2013 Ken, Boris, Sadiq \u2013 have found riverside development useful to their political objectives. \u201cI just wanted more investment,\u201d says Livingstone now. \u201cI grew up in a London where there was desperate poverty. When I started working in 1962 my best mate lived in a really run down little flat.\u201d He saw an opportunity to fund social housing on the back of developers\u2019 profits. Boris Johnson also wanted investment. \u201cHe went round the world\u201d, says Edward Lister, now Lord Udny-Lister, who was deputy mayor and chief of staff under Johnson, \u201cto China, Dubai, Qatar, Malaysia, America\u201d, armed with brochures boosting riverside developments. \u201cIt was all about promoting London as a global city, as an exciting place to be.\u201d Indeed, these binges of construction have brought homes and jobs to their locations. A large part of the case for 72 Upper Ground is the 4,000 jobs that its developers say will come to it. But it is questionable whether the high-rise, high-price apartments, often sold to overseas investors, that new riverside developments tend to create are the homes Londoners most need. Rates of affordable housing have been low. For Eshalomi, the principal objection to 72 Upper Ground is less about its appearance than the lack of \u201chigh-quality, affordable housing\u201d that it offers, and the limited amount of affordable workspace. And, if new and large developments are desirable for the benefits they bring, it should not have been beyond the wit of a city like London to plan them in such a way that they enhance the river rather than blight it. Their problem is not so much their size, as what they do with it. Hamburg managed public-spirited coordination with the HafenCity development on its waterfront, as did Barcelona with its old harbour areas and beach. It is not as if no one saw the current situation coming \u2013 people have been coming up with visions and plans for this historic waterway for decades. * * * The Thames was once both London\u2019s main sewer and its industrial artery, with wharves, warehouses, factories and power stations along much of its length. More salubrious parts of the city turned their backs on it, until the building of its Victorian embankments began its slow rehabilitation. The 1951 Festival of Britain, followed by the Southbank Centre, brought publicly funded culture to its banks. Over the second half of the 20th century the industries drifted away, although 1970s Labour councils, aiming to preserve jobs, tried to forbid other uses. When those restrictions were lifted, large areas of land became available for redevelopment. So the dirty old river was now, to use what became a much-used phrase, \u201cLondon\u2019s greatest opportunity\u201d. There was the prospect of giving London a civilised and beautiful connection to its waterfront, more Seine-like, for the Thames to become a true heart of the city. It was also a chance to attract investment and make money. So conspicuous proposals started popping up, both for commercial projects like a tower in Vauxhall called the \u201cGreen Giant\u201d, and for people-friendly bridges and parks.  One of the most determined campaigners for a better Thames was Richard Rogers, a charismatic figure given to making passionate declarations in brightly coloured shirts. In 1986, he produced a plan called London As It Could Be, displayed with a magnificent model at the Royal Academy, whereby a linear park would be created on car-free embankments, and a futuristic footbridge would enable happy citizens to stroll between a re-energised South Bank and a newly pedestrianised Trafalgar Square. These ideas reappeared in A New London, a 1992 book written with the Labour shadow arts minister Mark Fisher, in the hope of influencing the Neil Kinnock government that never happened. Here, Rogers declared that \u201cthere can be no new London without a reawakened river\u201d. Belief in the importance of the river ran across party lines \u2013 John Gummer, environment secretary in John Major\u2019s government, set up a Thames Advisory Group \u2013 and there were successes. The 90s revival of interest contributed to the creation of Tate Modern, Shakespeare\u2019s Globe, the London Eye and new footbridges between north and south banks. Successive initiatives from the 1970s on opened up riverside walks. Attractive and affordable places to live were created around Coin Street, just behind the location of the current proposals for 72 Upper Ground. A Thames Landscape Strategy was created for the more Arcadian stretches upriver from central London, with the support, among others, of David Attenborough. It has been quietly operative for 28 years. When Livingstone was elected mayor in 2000 he wanted to energise London by increasing population in its centre. He saw property developers as useful allies, encouraging them to build as much as possible, such that he could extract a tithe for affordable housing and other benefits. He also appointed Rogers as an adviser, so as to achieve the objective for which he had long argued: the creation of dense, vibrant urban developments formed around well-designed public spaces, along the lines of Barcelona and Paris. \u201cRichard Rogers was brilliant,\u201d says Livingstone, \u201che just wanted a good balance.\u201d  The only snag was that Rogers lacked much direct say over the \u201copportunity areas\u201d designated by Livingstone\u2019s administration as places ripe for \u201clarge-scale developments\u201d. Several are on the river: for example, at Vauxhall, Nine Elms, Battersea (VNEB for short), at Waterloo, at London Bridge/Bankside, and further downstream on the Isle of Dogs. It was hard to see much of Barcelona in the sketchy masterplans drawn up for these places, and the profit-grabbing towers that were proposed looked more like Dubai or Shanghai. A key moment came with a public inquiry into the Vauxhall Tower, a luxury residential building project supported both by Livingstone and the deputy prime minister John Prescott. In 2005, the latter gave it planning permission, despite the advice of a planning inquiry that it would harm the world heritage site around the Palace of Westminster.  Rogers\u2019s ambitions for coherent urban design, for plans where the whole is more than the sum of the parts \u2013 what Livingstone calls \u201cbalance\u201d \u2013 were rinsed out of the process. Almost anything could be allowed, was the message, no matter how big or high or clumsily designed. In 2008, Boris Johnson became mayor, campaigning during the election against \u201cDubai-on-Thames\u201d, before \u2013 in a manoeuvre of a kind that would become familiar \u2013 proceeding to encourage just the thing he had said he would stop. The United States government was persuaded to relocate its embassy from Mayfair to Nine Elms, an area still characterised by a Royal Mail depot and the New Covent Garden fruit and vegetable market \u2013 one that Donald Trump would later call \u201chorrible\u201d. This was a coup, and created the chance to make what could have been a beautiful new neighbourhood around the prestigious building. A consortium of Malaysian investors took on the colossal listed building that is Battersea power station, which since its closure in 1983 had confounded attempts at regeneration. An extension of the London Underground\u2019s Northern line, serving Nine Elms and the power station, was planned and eventually built.  The investors came. Developers of projects at VNEB include DAMAC from Dubai, the Saudi-backed VCI Property Holding, the Chinese R&amp;F and CC Land, the Malaysian EcoWorld. A game often popular in the property business was played, whereby planning permission was gained, and then a new one submitted for a yet bigger project, the site often having been sold in the meantime. Mayor Johnson had the right, like a Roman emperor in an amphitheatre, to give a thumbs up or thumbs down to major projects, a power he liked to exercise in favour of developers. Among his motivations was a desire to meet London-wide targets of 40,000 new homes per year, perhaps to enhance his CV in any future bid for higher office. (In the 2019 general election campaign, he would falsely boast that as mayor he had \u201cmassively outbuilt Labour\u201d). Lister says that 20,000 homes and 25,000 jobs had been \u201csecured\u201d in VNEB when Johnson left office in 2016 \u2013 \u201cin that sense it\u2019s been brilliant,\u201d he says. But major developments in the area have provided \u201caffordable\u201d housing at rates of 9% and 11%, even using broad definitions of the term that include quite expensive homes, compared with the 50% that Livingstone demanded and Khan\u2019s target of 35%. That Johnson was playing a numbers game is evident in the havoc of towers now built in the opportunity areas. These are statistics made material, silos of residential units, 30, 40 and 50-storey storage facilities for habitation. The pressure for volume has in Waterloo and Battersea created deep chasms between buildings where high prices are asked for homes with limited views and daylight. The selection of celebrity architects, such as Norman Foster and Frank Gehry next to Battersea power station, does not make the spaces between their multi-storey creations any less dismal. Luxury is largely private, for example in the Versace-designed apartments in the 50-storey DAMAC tower. Passersby get only to gawp at this high life, in the form of the all-glass swimming pool 35 metres off the ground, in the cool blue of a branded gin bottle, that bridges two blocks opposite the US embassy. The best that an ordinary pedestrian gets are some not-bad open spaces around the embassy and in front of the power station. A linear park allegedly based on New York\u2019s High Line is also under way. Inevitably, it resembles its famous inspiration more by being narrow than for memorable design. * * * The most obvious lack is of any kind of overall strategy or authority, of a kind proposed by John Gummer nearly 30 years ago. \u201cIt is such a glaring error,\u201d says Nicky Gavron, who was on Gummer\u2019s advisory group and was later deputy mayor under Livingstone. This absence of overview owes something to the fact that the banks of the Thames are in the care of 17 boroughs of varying party allegiances, which makes coordinated action a task of herding cats. The river is for most of its length a boundary between one borough and another, and it\u2019s a well-known phenomenon of local authorities that they care more about their centres \u2013 where more of their voters get to experience the results of their decisions \u2013 than their edges.  Thus, for all the many protestations of love for the Thames, and declarations of its significance, it is something of an orphan child. In theory, the mayor of London should have the authority and oversight to see the bigger picture. In practice, politicians at all levels are incentivised to encourage quantities of development, and not worry too much about the quality. The final say rests with central government, which has also been developer-friendly. In 2020, the then communities secretary Robert Jenrick gave approval to VCI\u2019s proposals for Vauxhall, even though they breached policies on both affordable housing and height. The design of the project, by Zaha Hadid Architects, was, he said, \u201coutstanding\u201d. The role of the public inquiry into 72 Upper Ground is to make a recommendation, with the ultimate decision made by the communities secretary, a fast-changing position currently held by Michael Gove, back for a second stint after a three-and-a-half month absence from government. Gove has spoken of his wish to put \u201cbeauty\u201d at the heart of planning, which should surely mean refusal. If it is permitted, then almost anything goes. What would be even better is if he at last brought about the overall strategy for the river of which so many have spoken."

                    "body": "Zoe Williams\u2019 excellent article on the independent inquiry into child sexual abuse quotes some of those who participated in its Truth Project (What kind of society fails to protect children? British society. Here\u2019s the proof, 20 October). I am one of them, identified as Barbara. I was abused by a family member when I was 10 years old. The police found out about it and took me and the perpetrator to the police station. I was on my own when I was questioned and was made to feel like I had done something wrong. I felt like I was the criminal. I had flashbacks to that episode for years. Nothing was done about the perpetrator and he attempted to abuse me again. I was offered no help whatsoever. Due to it being the 1960s, some may say that is how it was in those days, and there wasn\u2019t the awareness that there is now. That doesn\u2019t excuse the damage that was done to many children. When I first found out about the Truth Project, I thought it didn\u2019t apply to me, but they said it wasn\u2019t just for victims of institutional abuse; it was for anyone who had been let down by the authorities. I never told anyone what had happened and it has taken me years and lots of therapy to get over the abuse and the way I was treated by the police, but taking part in the Truth Project was a real turning point for me. Finally my suffering was being acknowledged and finally there is a record of the way I was treated by the police and neglected by social services. I want to thank everyone involved in the project from the bottom of my heart. They did everything to make me feel comfortable.  When I think back to that horrible time, I now feel I have those people who helped me standing at my side and I am no longer that frightened child in the police station.Name and address supplied  \u2022 Have an opinion on anything you\u2019ve read in the Guardian today?

                    "body": "Lewis Hamilton has accused Formula One stewards of potential bias towards specific drivers and teams as old wounds were reopened on the first day of pre-season testing in Barcelona on Wednesday.\nThe seven-time world champion, who was controversially denied an eighth title at the season finale in 2021, suggested there was institutionalised favouritism the sport had to address.\n\n\u201cWe need to make sure we get non-biased stewards,\u201d he said.\n\u201cRacing drivers, some are very, very good friends with certain individuals. Some travel with certain individuals, and tend to take more of a keen liking to some of them.\n\u201cI just think [we need] people who have no bias and are super central when it comes to making decisions.\u201d\nLast week Hamilton expressed his disappointment at the then-race director Michael Masi\u2019s decisions at the fateful Abu Dhabi GP where Hamilton was overtaken by Max Verstappen on the last lap, leading to the Dutchman\u2019s maiden world title. Masi has since been removed from his post by the FIA and the British driver had made it clear he wanted to move on. However, speaking at the Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya before climbing behind the wheel of his Mercedes W13, Hamilton chose to make this striking accusation of bias.\nThe FIA assigns to each race four stewards, at least one of whom will be a driver who has raced at a competitive level. Vitantonio Liuzzi, who competed for Red Bull in 2005 and then its sister team, formerly Toro Rosso, in 2006 and 2007, was employed by the FIA at four of the 22 races last year.\nLiuzzi was the driver steward at last year\u2019s Brazilian GP, one of the four stewards who controversially opted not to penalise Verstappen for driving Hamilton off the road while defending his place. The decision was questioned by many drivers for appearing inconsistent after similar incidents that season had resulted in a penalty, and was brought up by drivers at their briefing at the following round in Qatar.\n\nThe Mercedes team principal, Toto Wolff, questioned the accusation of bias while backing his driver in the call for the stewarding to reach a uniform standard. \u201cWe need professionalism in the steward\u2019s room,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think there is conscious bias to be honest. Most important, whether we talk about race direction or the stewards there needs to be a standard.\n\u201cThis is what we deserve, this is what everybody expects. We have all talked about the consistency. There should not be a lot of room to interpret rules, there should not be leniency depending on what a potential outcome might be. The rules are rules.\u201d\nRed Bull\u2019s team principal, Christian Horner, echoed the call for consistency but denied he believed there had been any bias shown by stewards. \u201cWe have all been on the end of stewards\u2019 decisions we have been unhappy about,\u201d he said.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think there is an intended bias, I am not aware of stewards travelling with drivers to races. Giving a better infrastructure for clearer decisions and clearer regulations is something that should be strived for but I certainly don\u2019t think there has been any bias from stewards through the last seasons.\u201d\n\nF1 has entered the opening phase of a new era in Barcelona with the cars on track for the first time after a raft of regulation changes, aimed at improving the racing. They present a fundamental change in aerodynamic philosophy, attempting to mandate the majority of downforce is created by ground effect to decrease and divert the wash behind a car and allow for greater overtaking opportunities.\nIntriguingly, there have been a variety of interpretations of the rules, making for a range of diversion of design. In testing they all cleared the first hurdle, they look good on track and on day one were running with consistency and no shortage of pace, especially through the faster corners despite carrying greater weight this season. Charles Leclerc topped the timesheets in the morning session for Ferrari, putting in 80 laps. Hamilton, now entering his 16th season, took to the track in the afternoon and completed a solid run, fifth fastest with 50 laps under his belt, while Lando Norris was quickest for McLaren in the second session."

                    "body": "The world\u2019s donor drought, and growing global divisions over Afghanistan\u2019s political direction, have been laid bare when a UN appeal for $4.4bn (\u00a33.35bn) to help Afghanistan fell massively short, the second UN donor conference in a month to do so. Donor countries pledged only $2.44bn towards the appeal, a senior UN official said on Thursday after a high-level pledging conference. David Miliband \u2013 chief executive of the International Rescue Committee, one of the NGOs most active in Afghanistan \u2013 said: \u201cThe failure to properly fund the humanitarian appeal today will have immediate and devastating consequences for the Afghan people. This summit today offered a small window of opportunity to stave off further suffering in 2022, but this failure must hang heavy on the shoulders of donors.\u201d It follows a UN Yemen pledging conference a month ago which raised only $1.3bn against a target of $4.3bn, of which nearly $600m came from the US alone. Some of the longstanding donors in the Middle East, notably Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, appear to be holding back, although Qatar is heavily committed to the Afghan process and acted as a co-sponsor of Thursday\u2019s conference. In a sign of a growing global diplomatic split over Afghanistan, the Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, claimed the donor conference had been hastily assembled at a fortnight\u2019s notice and it was for Nato countries to clear up their mess in the country. \u201cAfter 20 years of Nato\u2019s military presence and the failed experiment to impose prescriptions and values which were totally alien to the Afghan people, the \u2018collective west\u2019 bears direct responsibility for the current humanitarian situation and the deplorable state of the Afghan economy. Therefore, it must assume most of the financial burden for overcoming the crisis and bringing the situation back to normal.\u201d Lavrov also backed diplomatic recognition of the Taliban, so long as the government was made more representative of Afghan\u2019s ethnic mix, but conspicuously did not make a Taliban fulfilment of its pledge to let older girls return to full-time education a precondition of recognition. Speaking at a meeting of foreign ministers from Afghanistan\u2019s neighbouring countries hosted by China, Lavrov questioned why the UN conference was being held on the same day as the neighbours\u2019 conference, accusing the west of using the UN to create divisions. At the UN conference, the UK pledged \u00a3286m, the US $512m, Germany \u20ac200m and the EU \u20ac113m \u2013 all amounts that would ensure the appeal was going to fall well short.  The UN secretary general, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, had appealed for generosity at the start of the conference, saying the humanitarian situation in Afghanistan had \u201cdeteriorated alarmingly\u201d and urged donors to provide \u201cunconditional and flexible funding\u201d towards its $4.4bn appeal for aid. He said the Afghan economy had effectively collapsed and the country was in a death spiral. The UN says more than 24.4 million people require humanitarian assistance to survive. Food security levels have plunged at a rate not seen elsewhere in such a short period, with half the population facing acute hunger, including 9 million people in emergency food insecurity \u2013 the highest number globally. The donor conference was overshadowed by the Taliban\u2019s surprise decision to maintain a ban on older girls\u2019 education, setting back hopes that the Taliban might secure western diplomatic recognition and in turn make it easier for the west to help the country\u2019s long-term development without the threat of sanctions. The World Bank has already put on hold plans to spend $600m to review the impact of the Taliban decision.  Annalena Baerbock, the German foreign minister, said: \u201cAfghan girls were eager to get back to their classrooms last week: to return to their books, to resume their education and to see their classmates again. But when they arrived at their schools, they were sent home. It broke my heart to see the images of girls crying in front of their closed schools. \u201cBut it also filled my heart with courage to see that many bravely took to the streets to demonstrate for their right to an education. Together with our partners, we urgently call upon the Taliban to grant equal access to education, everywhere in the country. The plight of girls is a dark illustration of the suffering of the Afghan people: the humanitarian crisis Afghans face is among the gravest in the world.\u201d Liz Truss, the UK foreign secretary, announcing the UK pledge, said: \u201cOur potential to provide support will depend on how constructively the Taliban engage on key issues like the rights of women and girls and also ethnic and religious minorities. \u201cWomen and girls are amongst the most marginalised groups. They have been denied opportunities in education and employment \u2013 which are key drivers of equality. No nation can succeed if half of its population is held back.\u201d"

                    "body": "Lenny Taylor made only a single fleeting appearance for Manchester United\u2019s vaunted 1992 FA Youth Cup victors and never played professionally but he remains enchanted by his experience at the club. Taylor was released by Alex Ferguson days after David Beckham, Gary Neville, Nicky Butt and Ryan Giggs led Eric Harrison\u2019s starlets to the 6-3 aggregate triumph over Crystal Palace that was the launchpad for their stellar careers. Yet 30 years later, and with close to 60,000 tickets sold for Wednesday\u2019s final of the 2022 edition at Old Trafford between United and Nottingham Forest, Taylor exudes pride at a journey that began at a trial as a Birmingham schoolboy.  \u201cI was chosen for a mass game in Nuneaton,\u201d he says. \u201cI was a right-back and we all played a half each and Ferguson was there. We had a little conversation afterwards \u2013 it was around Valentine\u2019s Day so we cracked a few jokes about that. I signed YTS forms, went and watched a United game and it did wow me \u2013 I met some of the players and started to think: \u2018Hang on. This is completely different.\u2019\u201d Taylor took digs near United\u2019s old training ground. \u201cAround the corner from The Cliff, just off Lower Broughton Road,\u201d he says. \u201cRobbie Savage stayed there, and there was also Colin Telford, Giuliano Maiorana, Andy Rammell, Roger Sallis, Colin McKee.\u201d Ferguson\u2019s renowned network of informants stretched to Taylor\u2019s landlady, who one night caught him using a novel way to gain entry. \u201cUp a drainpipe,\u201d he says. \u201cNo one was answering the door. It was late and everyone was sound asleep and I thought: \u2018You know what? The lads are in bed so they\u2019ll hear me if I\u2019m tapping the window.\u2019 They did and let me in. By that time, the landlady had caught me and I was reported. Eric Harrison pulled me in and the gaffer had a few words with me.\u201d There was an escape, though, when Ferguson stormed an infamous party at Lee Sharpe\u2019s house in Altrincham at which Giggs was an attendee too. Taylor says: \u201cMe, John O\u2019Kane, and Raph Burke [all trainees] were upstairs and heard a voice and realised it was the gaffer. We were like: \u2018Oh, crap.\u2019 He was bawling, kicking everyone out. Then, he says: \u2018Right, is there anyone upstairs?\u2019 We all looked at one another and thought: \u2018Oh, shit, please don\u2019t come up.\u2019 We couldn\u2019t wait for him to go so we could get our arses home.\u201d  The Scot was as diligent regarding on-field development. \u201cIf he wasn\u2019t there personally, he\u2019d be on the phone or get information from Eric or Nobby [Stiles, another coach] because he\u2019d say: \u2018I heard you had a great game,\u2019\u201d Taylor says. Stiles was a United legend who won the championship, FA Cup and European Cup at the club and was in England\u2019s triumphant 1966 World Cup side. \u201cWe were very fortunate to have him,\u201d says Taylor. \u201cHis mentality was beyond belief. There were times where he put us in our place and got a bit frustrated, but he wanted the best for us. He\u2019d pull us aside, sometimes other lads, especially defenders like John O\u2019Kane, and Gaz [Neville]. Sometimes he\u2019d have a little one-on-one with us and say: \u2018This is how you should approach things.\u2019\u201d Of a crop that also featured Paul Scholes and whose best players formed the nucleus of a United team that dominated domestic football, Taylor selects Giggs as the force.  \u201cEven at that age, you go: \u2018Wow.\u2019 You couldn\u2019t mark him because of his awareness and pure pace. But don\u2019t get me wrong, he didn\u2019t like coming up against me in training.\u201d Of the vaunted quintet who, with Phil Neville, became known as the Class of 92, Taylor says: \u201cWe didn\u2019t think anything of them then. It was: \u2018Let\u2019s get training, win games.\u2019 When you put on that jersey you\u2019re playing in a cup final every day.\u201d  Giggs became United\u2019s record appearance holder, playing 963 times. Gary Neville was made captain by Ferguson in the mid-2000s. By then Beckham was England\u2019s leader and Butt had been selected in the 2002 Fifa World Cup team of the tournament. Phil Neville enjoyed 11 years in the first team. Although Scholes has a claim to be the finest of the six he did not feature in the Youth Cup run. \u201cIt sounds silly,\u201d Taylor says. \u201cBut he had a few issues with his shin or his knees. Once these were over, you could tell he would be some player. He was cheeky \u2013 would have a smile for you if he pinged the ball a certain way or controlled it a certain way.\u201d Taylor\u2019s moment came in the semi-final second leg against Tottenham at White Hart Lane where a 2-1 win took United to the final. \u201cEric brought me on in the last few minutes and apologised for leaving it so late. I said: \u2018Don\u2019t worry.\u2019 I\u2019m not 100% sure if I even touched the ball \u2013 I probably did \u2013 but I was glad to be part of the team.\u201d Taylor departed after the final. He says: \u201cIt was a bit soul-destroying. Eric mentioned Peter Reid [Manchester City\u2019s manager] might be interested but nothing happened. I went to Port Vale for a trial and nothing happened either. Walsall were interested in taking me for a year but I declined. Maybe it was the wrong decision but I didn\u2019t have someone advising me. I ended up going to Solihull Borough. I was there for about three years, but I was mainly in their reserves. \u201cI was trying to work shifts and train and play, and in the end I said: \u2018I\u2019ve had enough.\u2019 I went on to do what everyone else does: survive. I was about 28, 29. Since then I\u2019ve worked in a metal coating factory, done labouring for an electrical company.\u201d  There is no bitterness though. \u201cI had my crack,\u201d says Taylor. \u201cI said to my mum: \u2018I apologise, I wish I could have made it so I could take care of you and all my family and friends.\u2019 She said: \u2018Don\u2019t worry, son. You did yourself proud and that\u2019s all we can ask for.\u2019 I tell my 10-year-old daughter, Cyann, that. \u2018Do yourself proud. If you\u2019re down, pick yourself up.\u2019\u201d Taylor remains grateful. \u201cWe achieved as a group, whether I played in the final or not,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd some got in the first team, some made history: trebles, titles, FA Cup wins, Super Cup wins, European Cup wins. I was very lucky to be part of what led to that.\u201d With his partner, Tina, Taylor is now a carer for her son, who has autism. \u201cThere are days when I think: \u2018Ah, it\u2019s such a shame.\u2019 But you know what? Try and put a smile on your face and be a kinder person. What I experienced can\u2019t be taken away from me ever.\u201d"

Sadio Man\u00e9\u2019s clever winner cut City\u2019s advantage to just goal difference before they visit Wolves on Wednesday, and Klopp conceded the leaders had signed a \u201cbeast\u201d in Erling Haaland.  Asked how easy it is for Liverpool not to concern themselves about City, Klopp replied: \u201cFor me it is absolutely no problem. I have invited the boys to follow my mindset. We are still chasing like mad. We just know we have to win and now we have to recover and then to play the FA Cup final [on Saturday] because there is no mercy nowhere because of this situation [where we are] qualifying for all finals. We play an incredibly big game and from Thursday on we will prepare.\u201d Douglas Luiz scored early for Villa but Liverpool hit back three minutes later through Jo\u00ebl Matip before Man\u00e9\u2019s clever header from Luis D\u00edaz\u2019s cross midway through the second half secured victory. Klopp praised the mentality of his players and Alisson for making a world-class save to deny Danny Ings an equaliser. The manager confirmed Andy Robertson was rested for Saturday\u2019s final against Chelsea, for which Fabinho is a doubt after being forced off with a muscle problem. When asked how much stronger Haaland will make City after his \u00a351m move from Borussia Dortmund, Klopp could not help but smile. \u201cA lot,\u201d he said. \u201cCity was and will never be a team that wins games because of one player, because of the specific way they play. I think Erling will certainly score a lot of goals. He is a real beast. He was injured a couple of times at Dortmund but when he is fit he is a real beast. Unfortunately, he is a really good signing.\u201d  The Villa manager and former Liverpool captain, Steven Gerrard, conceded Ings would play missed chances \u201cover in his head on the way home\u201d but was delighted with his side\u2019s display. \u201cWe\u2019re slightly frustrated we didn\u2019t score more than once,\u201d said Gerrard, who reiterated his intention to sign Philippe Coutinho on a permanent deal from Barcelona. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to take those big moments we created. The big positives for me are that we were brave, courageous and went toe-to-toe with one of the best teams in the world. We knew at times we would have to suffer.\u201d"

Updated at 6.27pm BST    5.22pm    A smiling Emma Hayes leads her team up to collect their winners\u2019 medals. She has now won 11 major honours: five league titles, four FA Cups and two League Cups. By any standards, she is an all-time great.   Updated at 5.41pm BST    5.18pm         5.16pm    Suzanne Wrack\u2019s match report      5.15pm    Erin Cuthbert\u2019s verdict \u201cI struggle to find words to sum that up. What a performance from the girls. We knew it would be a tough slog. It\u2019s so hard when you concede five minutes from time; it really does take the wind out of your sails. We had to regroup at the start of extra time, and we found a level that we\u2019ve not found in ourselves. \u201cD\u2019you know what, I honestly don\u2019t score many goals. It\u2019s an amazing honour. I thought it was gonna be the winning goal and it wasn\u2019t! It doesnae matter if it was a good goal or not \u2013 Sam\u2019s was a deflection and that\u2019s as important because it was the winner. \u201cWe\u2019ve faced a lot of adversity this year \u2013 Covid, injuries \u2013 and we\u2019ve had to use the squad. I think that really helped us today. I\u2019m just so proud to end the season on a high. [Waves her POTM champagne around] I\u2019ll be drinking this all tonight, thank you!\u201d   Updated at 5.34pm BST    5.11pm    The player of the match is Erin Cuthbert. Not content with being an elemental force in midfield, she put Chelsea 2-1 up with a stunning goal.  The other two were scored by the inevitable Sam Kerr, who has apparentlybeen credited with the winning goal. Four goals in a week, to win the two biggest prizes in English football: yeah, she\u2019d have taken that.      5.09pm    One Step Beyond, the Chelsea anthem, is blaring out across Wembley. They\u2019re a great side, who deserve everything they get, but you have to feel for City. The margins are so fine. One split-second misjudgement from Alanna Kennedy, one deflection off Alex Greenwood. And like that, it\u2019s gone.    Updated at 6.21pm BST    5.07pm    That was a marvellous, which could have gone either way. The only sadness is that a game full of outstanding goals was settled by both a mistake and a deflection. The manner of the winning goal haunt Alanna Kennedy for a long time.      5.05pm   Full time: Chelsea 3-2 Manchester City  Chelsea have done the Double Double! For the second year in a row, and the third in five, they have won the WSL and the FA Cup. They also won the Continental Cup last year, so technically this season has been an abject comedown, but they\u2019ll get over it.     Updated at 5.33pm BST    5.04pm    120+1 min Roebuck stays back in the end, and the corner is driven straight into the arms of Ann-Katrin Berger. There are two minutes of added time.     5.03pm    120 min City win a corner on the right. It\u2019s now or never, and Ellie Roebuck is coming forward...  Updated at 5.03pm BST    5.01pm    118 min: City substitution Vicky Losada on, Keira Walsh off.     5.01pm    118 min: Chelsea substitution Maren Mjelde is on for Ji So-yun, who came on as a sub in the second half of normal time.      4.59pm    116 min Hemp\u2019s cross is cleared by Carter but only to Weir, who spanks high and wide from 25 yards with her right foot. That wasn\u2019t the right decision.   Updated at 5.09pm BST    4.57pm    114 min Chelsea have parked the bus and frankly I don\u2019t blame them. It\u2019s been an exhausting match, mentally and physically.   Updated at 5.06pm BST    4.56pm    113 min Bronze is fouled by Andersson on the right wing. Greenwood\u2019s free-kick is headed away well by the backpedalling Cuthbert.  Updated at 4.56pm BST    4.54pm    110 min Andersson\u2019s corner leads to a game of head tennis in the City area. Eventually Kerr hits a volley that is blocked by Greenwood in the six-yard box.     4.52pm    109 min Raso tries to scurry away from Andersson, who does brilliantly to keep pace and then win a goalkick off Raso.     4.49pm    106 min A half chance for City within 25 seconds of the restart. Bronze\u2019s cutback is collected by Coombs, who smacks the boucing ball over the bar from a tight angle.     4.48pm    106 min Peep peep!      4.48pm    That might go down as an Alex Greenwood own goal, in fact. We\u2019ve just seen a replay which suggested Kerr\u2019s shot might have been going wide of the far post. That would be especially cruel on Greenwood, who has been outstanding and did precisely nowt wrong.     4.46pm   Half time in extra time: Chelsea 3-2 Man City  Sam Kerr\u2019s second goal means Manchester City have go to the well once again.    Updated at 4.57pm BST    4.44pm    105 min: Chance for City! Blakstad\u2019s cross is headed across goal by White and volleyed wide by the off balance Raso.      4.43pm    104 min Here\u2019s Sam Kerr\u2019s second goal of the game, which restored Chelsea\u2019s lead. She\u2019s had a quiet game, actually, and she\u2019s still scored two.      4.41pm    102 min Sheesh, football is cruel sometimes. I\u2019m fairly sure that would have been a comfortable save for Roebuck without the deflection off Greenwood.     4.39pm    Alanna Kennedy is devastated, because it was her mistake that led to the goal. She ran past a bouncing ball just inside the Chelsea half, which allowed Sam Kerr to lead a two-v-one break with Jessie Fleming. Kerr ran to just inside the City area, used Fleming by not using her and hit a right-footed shot that took a big deflection off the stretching Alex Greenwood and wrong-footed Ellie Roebuck. What an awful moment for Kennedy, a split-second misjudgement that could be so costly.      Updated at 5.19pm BST    4.38pm   GOAL! Chelsea 3-2 Man City (Kerr 99)  Chelsea are ahead for the third time!     4.36pm    96 min: Vital defending by Carter! Bright\u2019s loose straight pass is nicked by Weir, 25 yards from goal. She moves into the area and drives a cross-shot that is taken off White\u2019s toes by Carter. The ball runs through to Berger, who is clattered painfully by White in her follow through. There was no malice in it.     4.33pm    93 min Weir arrows the corner towards the penalty spot, where Bronze backheels a volley well wide. Kennedy was waiting behind her to attempt a more orthodox and less difficult volley. Bronze, usually so majestic, has had quite a disappointing game.  Updated at 4.33pm BST    4.32pm    93 min The relentless Hemp runs Charles on the left side of the area and smashes a cross that ricochets behind for a City corner.     4.31pm    92 min Here\u2019s that nerveless finish from Hayley Raso which took the game to extra-time.      4.30pm    91 min Peep peep! Extra time is under way. Chelsea have brought Jonna Andersson on for Guro Reiten at left wing-back.     4.25pm   Full time: Chelsea 2-2 Manchester City  A fantastic FA Cup final is going to extra-time.     4.24pm    90+3 min Hemp wriggles away from Charles on the left and hits a brilliant cross that just evades the leaping Raso. A Chelsea defender - don\u2019t ask me who - did superbly to lean into Raso and affect her jump.  Updated at 4.24pm BST    4.21pm    90 min Four minutes of added time. This has been a belting game, so we won\u2019t say no to another half an hour.  Updated at 4.21pm BST    4.21pm    Greenwood pinged an angled ball towards Raso, who made a fine run infield from the right. She controlled it magnificently with her shoulder, taking the last defender Eriksson out of the game in the process, and then forced the bouncing ball unerringly past Berger. In the circumstances, that is sensational finishing.      Updated at 5.46pm BST    4.19pm   GOAL! Chelsea 2-2 Man City (Raso 89)  The substitute Hayley Raso equalises with another outstanding goal!     4.18pm    88 min Lots of City pressure now, with Chelsea\u2019s defenders increasingly stretched. Raso plays a good ball to the underlapping Bronze... who is offside. That\u2019s really poor from Bronze.     4.17pm    87 min Weir loses Cuthbert in midfield, moves to the edge of the area but then drives too close to Berger.     4.15pm    85 min Greenwood\u2019s floated free-kick is helped on and wide of goal by Bronze. A half chance at best.     4.13pm    83 min City bring on Julia Blakstad to replace Demi Stokes at left-back.     4.12pm    82 min Chelsea could be eight minutes from their third Double in five years.     4.11pm    81 min The marauding Hemp is taken out unashamedly by Carter, who is booked.      4.10pm    81 min Another change for City: Laura Coombs is on for Georgia Stanway.     4.10pm    80 min A substitution apiece. Chelsea bring on Jessie Fleming for Pernille Harder; City introduce Ellen White in place of Bunny Shaw.     4.09pm    79 min Shaw nutmegs Carter on the right and moves into the area. Her cutback is blocked by Eriksson (I think) and Stanway thrashes the loose ball over from 20 yards.     4.08pm    78 min Harder gallops into space down the right, moves infield and squares the ball to Kerr just inside the area. She misses her kick, and then Reiten shapes a curling shot wide of the far post with her right foot.     4.06pm    76 min: City substitution There is a City change, but it\u2019s not Ellen White. Instead, Hayley Raso has come on for Chloe Kelly.     4.06pm    75 min City have some very good options on the bench, including Ellen White. She must come on soon, surely.     4.05pm    74 min Today\u2019s official attendance is 49,094, a new record for the women\u2019s FA Cup final. It\u2019s a record that won\u2019t last long, probably about 12 months.     4.03pm    72 min What a fortnight Erin Cuthbert has had. She changed the game when she came on as substitute at Birmingham, scored the first equaliser against Manchester United last weekend and may now have belted the winner in the FA Cup final. She has become an elemental force in midfield.     4.01pm    71 min Stokes has a cross-shot headed behind by Bright. Chelsea have indeed gone to a back four, with Carter at left-back and Charles on the right.     4.00pm    69 min: Double substitution for Chelsea Ji So-yun, who is leaving the club this summer, and Niamh Charles replace Beth England and Aniek Nouwen. That could mean a switch to a back four.     3.59pm    68 min Here\u2019s that marvellous goal from Erin Cuthbert.      3.57pm    67 min Weir\u2019s long-range drive is blocked by Bright. City have reacted well to going behind.     3.56pm    65 min City almost equalise straight away, but Shaw fresh-airs a shot on the turn from 10 yards!     3.55pm    Reiten squared the ball to England just inside the area. She laid it back to Cuthbert, who took a touch and dug out a rising drive that hit the underside of the bar and bounced into the net! Roebuck leapt to her right and was so close, but she couldn\u2019t quite get there. That\u2019s a stunning goal - not just the power and precision but also the speed with which Cuthbert took the shot. One quick touch to control and then, almost in the same movement, bang.      Updated at 4.23pm BST    3.53pm   WHAT A GOAL! Chelsea 2-1 Manchester City (Cuthbert 63)  Erin Cuthbert, one of the stars of Chelsea\u2019s lead, had given them the lead with a screamer!  Updated at 4.01pm BST    3.53pm    63 min Reiten\u2019s cross nicks off Bronze and flashes across the face of goal. And then...     3.52pm    61 min In the first half both teams looked desperate not to give away the first goal; now they look equally haunted by the prospect of conceding the third.     3.49pm    59 min Weir sprays an elegant pass down the left to Hemp, who beats Bright with ease but crosses too close to Ingle.     3.47pm    57 min Kerr\u2019s cross is cleared bravely by Bronze, with Cuthbert lining up for an overhead kick.      3.44pm    54 min Bronze is booked for a foul on Harder.     3.42pm    51 min: Fine save from Berger! City have made a flying start to the second half, as they did the first. Kelly\u2019s cross hits the head of Shaw, slightly ahead of the ball at the near post. City keep the ball alive, with Weir eventually teeing up Hemp for a first-time shot. Her fierce drive across goal is superbly saved by Berger and ricochets just wide of goal.    Updated at 4.04pm BST    3.37pm    47 min Shaw finds Hemp, whose clips a dangerous ball that flashes across the six-yard box.     3.35pm    46 min Peep peep! Bunny Shaw gets the second half under way.     3.20pm    Sign up for Moving the Goalposts! Informative, passionate, entertaining. Sign up to our weekly round-up of women\u2019s football now.     Updated at 3.32pm BST    3.20pm   Half time: Chelsea 1-1 Manchester City  Peep peep! It took a while to get going, but the last 15 minutes of the half were terrific. Sam Kerr put Chelsea ahead with a poacher\u2019s goal; Lauren Hemp equalised with a bit of individual brilliance. More please!    Updated at 3.23pm BST    3.18pm    45+2 min City again appeal unsuccessfully for a penalty, this time after Shaw goes over after a challenge from Nouwen. I\u2019d like to see that again - it was a clumsy tackle from Nouwen, and at first glance I thought she tripped Shaw.  Updated at 3.23pm BST    3.17pm    45+1 min Stanway has a couple of shots blocked in the space of five seconds. The second leads to a handball appeal against Carter that is turned down. It certainly hit Carter\u2019s right arm, though it was close to her body.     3.16pm    45 min Three minutes of added time. This game has really come to life since Sam Kerr gave Chelsea the lead.   Updated at 3.40pm BST    3.14pm    That\u2019s a brilliant equaliser. Shaw turned Nouwen smartly on the halfway line, moved forward and played the ball left to Hemp. Carter\u2019s challenge put Hemp off, forcing her to go a bit wide. But she retrieved the ball, cut back inside Bright and curled a superb right-footed shot into the far corner.  That is one of the reasons why Hemp is so lethal - she can now beat a defender on either side. I think she is, by a distance, the most exhilarating player in the WSL.   Updated at 3.20pm BST    3.12pm   GOAL! Chelsea 1-1 Man City (Hemp 42)  City have got more from Lauren Hemp!     3.10pm    40 min City need more from Lauren Hemp, who has been kept very quiet. In her defence, I\u2019m not sure how much service she has had. The rest of the forward line, Bunny Shaw and Chloe Kelly, have also struggled to have much influence.     3.09pm    38 min Harder shoots wide from distance. This is a nervy spell for City.     3.07pm    36 min That was such good anticipation from Kerr, who got the wrong side of Bronze to head Bright\u2019s cross into the net.    Updated at 3.09pm BST    3.05pm    34 min Another chance for Chelsea! Roebuck is challenged by Kelly, with the ball ricocheting to Reiten 30 yards from goal. She lofts a first-time shot over the bar. That was a good chance with Roebuck out of her goal, though there was at least one City defender on the line.     3.04pm    A free-kick from the left was half cleared, with the ball recycled to Bright on the right. She seemed to overhit a booming cross that sailed over the leaping Roebuck and was headed in from a yard by Kerr. At first I thought it had gone straight in, hence the description of it as a freak goal, but the ruthless Kerr definitely got the last touch.       Updated at 3.26pm BST    3.03pm   GOAL! Chelsea 1-0 Man City (Kerr 33)  Chelsea take the lead with a freak goal!  Updated at 3.04pm BST    3.01pm    30 min Alanna Kennedy is booked for an agricultural tackle on Pernille Harder.     2.59pm    29 min I don\u2019t know what to say. It\u2019s not a poor final by any means, it\u2019s just low on entertainment because both teams are a) playing a little cautiously and b) defending extremely well.   Updated at 3.06pm BST    2.58pm    27 min Kelly and Hemp have swapped wings.      2.56pm    26 min Kerr\u2019s long through pass towards Reiten is well intercepted by Kennedy.      2.54pm    24 min Nothing much is happening. There\u2019s a bit too much mutual respect, and both teams are playing with the handbrake on.  Updated at 3.39pm BST    2.52pm    21 min It\u2019s developing into a pretty cagey game, with both teams desperate not to concede the first goal.     2.48pm    18 min: Kerr has a goal disallowed for offside. It was a classy finish, as you\u2019d expect, but she was a fair way offside.   Updated at 2.56pm BST    2.46pm    16 min City are almost caught playing out from the back. Cuthbert intercepts Roebuck\u2019s pass 30 yards from goal but can\u2019t control it on the bounce.     2.43pm    14 min Stanway is a bit fortunate not to be booked for a poor challenge on Harder.     2.42pm    12 min Cuthbert\u2019s back on. It\u2019s pelting down at Wembley, by the way.      2.41pm    11 min Erin Cuthbert is down after a collision with Stokes. I think she\u2019ll be fine, and the breather might do Chelsea some good.     2.39pm    9 min Kelly\u2019s cross is headed away well by Carter, with Hemp waiting behind her. City have been the more relaxed, confident side so far.     2.38pm    7 min Chelsea are starting to feel their way into the game after that difficult start.      2.35pm    4 min: Just wide from Weir! City have made a blistering start. Stanway cleverly lost two players in midfield and found Hemp on the left of the area. She cut back inside Carter and had a right-foot shot blocked by the stretching Bright. The ball rebounded to Weir, whose fierce follow-up hit Bright and flew just wide. That was heroic defending from Millie Bright.     2.34pm    3 min Weir scored twice in City\u2019s Continental Cup final win over Chelsea in March. That was a pretty decent chance, especially as it was on her left foot.     2.33pm    2 min: Chance for Weir! City could have taken the lead inside 100 seconds. Hemp ran at Carter - what a duel that will be - and hit a cross that deflected towards Weir in the area. She ran onto the ball but lashed it over with her usually precise left foot.     2.32pm    2 min Chelsea have started, as expected, in a 3-4-1-2 formation. Pernille Harder is being Sam Kerr and Beth England.     2.30pm    1 min Peeeeeeeep peeeeeeeeeeep! Chelsea\u2019s Sophie Ingle gets the FA Cup final under way.     2.26pm    The players are on the field, being introduced to the various dignitaries. It\u2019s almost time for the 52nd women\u2019s FA Cup final.    Updated at 2.52pm BST    2.19pm    Ten minutes to kick off! Let\u2019s have a reminder of the teams Chelsea (possible 3-4-1-2) Berger; Bright, Nouwen, Eriksson; Carter, Cuthbert, Ingle, Reiten; Harder; England, Kerr.Substitutes: Musovic, Ji, Kirby, Fleming, Mjelde, James, Charles, Spence, Andersson. Manchester City (4-3-3) Roebuck; Bronze, Kennedy, Greenwood, Stokes; Stanway, Walsh, Weir; Kelly, Shaw, Hemp.Substitutes: Keating, Coombs, Angeldahl, Raso, Park, Losada, White, Mace, Blakstad. Referee Kirsty Dowle.   Updated at 2.50pm BST    1.47pm         1.46pm    I knew doing simultaneous MBMs would catch up with me. As you were.  Updated at 1.47pm BST    1.44pm         1.40pm         1.39pm         1.33pm         1.32pm   Team news  Two changes for Chelsea from the title-winning victory over Manchester United last Sunday. Aniek Nouwen and Beth England replace Niamh Charles and Jonna Andersson, which probably means Guro Reiten will play at wing-back. One change for City, with Demi Stokes returning at left-back in place of Julie Blakstad. There are some serious players on both benches, including Fran Kirby, Ji So-yun, Ellen White and Vicky Losada.    Updated at 1.45pm BST    1.27pm         1.07pm    Pre-match entertainment This is really good, and you are most welcome.      12.58pm    Early team news Chelsea magician Fran Kirby, who has been unavailable since February due to extreme fatigue, is in their squad today. \u201cShe looked like she hadn\u2019t even been away, she looked that good in training,\u201d said Emma Hayes. \u201cIt was nice to see a smile on her face and she\u2019s participated in everything. She\u2019s been in training all week so I\u2019m over the moon to be honest.\u201d  City are without Karen Bardsley, Steph Houghton and Esme Morgan, though Demi Stokes and Jess Park could be available.     12.57pm   Preamble  Hello and welcome to live coverage of the FA Cup final between Chelsea and Manchester City at Wembley. It\u2019s a mouthwatering prospect, and long overdue. These two teams have won the competition in each of the last five seasons, yet they\u2019ve never played each other in the final. Not in those five years, not ever. Both teams have a double in sight. For Chelsea it would the Double, the league and FA Cup, for the third time in five seasons. City want to add the FA Cup to the Continental Cup that they won so impressively in March. They were 1-0 down at half-time before blowing Chelsea away with three goals in 20 minutes. The teams have already met in the FA Cup this season, sort of. In October, Chelsea hammered City 3-0 in the semi-final of last season\u2019s competition, a game delayed because of Covid. City were at a low ebb then, ravaged by injury and searching desperately for any kind of optimism. They recovered admirably, and in 2022 have won 19 games out of 21 in all competitions. In fact, both sides have lost only one game since the turn of the year \u2013 to each other. Two great teams in great form in front of a record crowd for a women\u2019s FA Cup final; this, surely, can\u2019t fail to be good. Kick off 2.30pm.   Updated at 2.26pm BST "

                    "body": "The New York Rangers won\u2019t be given much of a chance to beat the Tampa Bay Lightning to make the Stanley Cup final. That is no big surprise. The Lightning have won twice as many Stanley Cups in the last two years as the Rangers have won in the last, um, 82. But the Rangers have made it to the Eastern Conference finals for the first time since 2015 \u2013 when they lost at home to the Lightning in the seventh game \u2013 and New York seems to be getting excited, which is good for the NHL, or any other professional league, for that matter. There really is, as the T-shirt that the high-scoring veteran forward Chris Kreider wore Tuesday to a news conference read, \u201cno quit in New York.\u201d The Rangers have faced elimination five times so far in the playoffs, and they have won all five games, including two Game 7s.  They scored two power-play goals in the first eight minutes and walloped the Carolina Hurricanes 6-2 in Game 7 of that series on Monday night. It was the first home playoff loss for the Canes, who had a better regular-season record than the Rangers. \u201cThe guys love playing for this group,\u201d said the 31-year-old Kreider, who has scored eight playoff goals after pumping in 52 goals in the regular season, easily a career high. \u201cIt\u2019s a tight-knit group. You see the guys doing the little things to help us win hockey games. We want to keep playing.\u201d Kreider is the only player who was around the last time the Rangers got this far. They\u2019d made it to the finals in 2014, only to lose to Los Angeles, and their chances of returning in 2015 looked quite good until the Lightning shut them out at Madison Square Garden in Game S7. The goaltender of that team, Henrik Lundqvist, has retired, and the general manager Jeff Gorton is not around, either. Gorton and former team president Glen Sather wrote a weird open letter to Rangers\u2019 fans in February 2018 in which they said that they planned to tear down an underachieving team to rebuild \u2013 but we sure do appreciate your support! Then they got rid of five top players, including the stoic captain and defenseman Ryan McDonagh, who has since won two Cups with Tampa Bay. On Tuesday, Kreider, who seems to look at life from a different angle, called McDonagh \u201cone of the best humans I\u2019ve played with.\u201d The Rangers made the playoffs just once between 2018 and this season \u2013 and they were pushed right back out, getting swept by Carolina in the qualifying round of the 2020 playoffs in the Covid bubble in Toronto. The series finale would turn out to be Lundqvist\u2019s last NHL game. The Rangers sacked their coach, David Quinn, after the Rangers missed the playoffs again last year. His replacement was a guy named Gerard Gallant, nicknamed \u201cTurk,\u201d who was part of the NHL\u2019s coach-recycling program. The Rangers are his fourth NHL stop. Gallant is an old left wing who was prolific back in his day, scoring 30 goals for the Detroit Red Wings in each of four straight seasons. But his teams in Columbus and Florida made the playoffs just once in his first six seasons as coach and were ousted in the first round. Then he was hired as the coach of the expansion Vegas Golden Knights in 2017, and, in one of the all-time sports stunners, Gallant helped make history by taking them all the way to the Stanley Cup final. He failed to win another playoff series and was out less than three years later. So the Rangers were not expected to do much this season, but Gallant got them to play hard, and, as important, pay a price to win games, which means nasty things like blocking shots. As he said after the Game 7 victory over Carolina on Monday, \u201cI\u2019ve said it 100 times this year: We\u2019re not perfect, but we find ways to win.\u201d They are old-fashioned, which New Yorkers really love. Their inspiration is the 28-year-old American defenseman Jacob Trouba, who ended Carolina forward Seth Jarvis\u2019s night Monday by drilling him with a legal check in the first period. It was Trouba\u2019s second jarring hit of the series. Both led to Rangers\u2019 power plays because the Hurricanes retaliated. Turk said Trouba is \u201cnot trying to hurt people out there. He just plays a heavy game.\u201d  It has helped that the Rangers have an elite goaltender in the 26-year-old Igor Shesterkin, who grew up in Moscow and was a fourth-round draft pick in 2014 but only joined the Rangers early in 2020. He has an impressive .928 save percentage in his first NHL playoffs. \u201cHis hockey IQ, I would say, is one of the highest on our team \u2013 and I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ve ever said that about a goalie on my team before, with all due respect,\u201d said the veteran center Ryan Strome, who started his career with the rival New York Islanders but now has played for the Rangers for four seasons. This series, which is to open Wednesday in New York, is being billed as a titanic matchup between Shesterkin and Tampa Bay goalie Andrei Vasilevskiy, a 27-year-old Russian who has won 57 career playoff games, including eight of 11 this season. The Lightning also have McDonagh and the formidable Victor Hedman on defense, among others. But Kreider has said this Rangers team reminds him of the 2014 and 2015 New York teams, who saw themselves as cockroaches. \u201cWe just didn\u2019t go away,\u201d Kreider said. \u201cWe just don\u2019t go away now. Regardless of the score, regardless of where the game is at, we just try to find our game, try to find our game, keep working.\u201d Whether it results in eight more victories and the Rangers\u2019 first Stanley Cup since 1994 \u2013 28 years ago already! \u2013 is to be determined. But these playoffs already are more fun than they have been in a few years because the Rangers, one of the Original Six, are still in them."

                    "body": "Queenslander Jason Kubler is celebrating the perfect birthday present after completing his own personal grand slam. The one-time world No 1 junior, who has been beset by injury woes in the senior ranks, said it felt \u201cunreal\u201d to make the French Open main draw at Roland Garros, thus completing his set of playing in all four majors. On his 29th birthday, getting through the gruelling ordeal of the qualifying tournament on the red clay in Paris was another sign that the former wunderkind is enjoying a late-career renaissance. Kubler defeated Portugal\u2019s Pedro Sousa 7-5, 6-2 in the third round and became the only Australian man to qualify this year.  \u201cFeels unreal. This was the last slam where I hadn\u2019t played a main draw,\u201d he said. \u201cLuckily, I got a wildcard into Aussie, and then another into US and then I qualified for Wimby, so it\u2019s nice to have qualified for another one. I guess just this year for me, in general, has been a pretty good one.\u201d It started on a high when he reached the mixed doubles final at the Australian Open with Jaimee Fourlis and continued with a couple of victories in lower-level events in Canberra. He put the lucrative pay day from the Melbourne final to good use. \u201cThat really set me up for the year and I could start investing myself with coaching and some sort of support along the road,\u201d he said. \u201cJust the exact same thing with this tournament now, I can really start to plan things, have a lot more people around me. Always makes it a bit easier with all the travel and stuff like that. If anything, it\u2019s just more money now that I can invest in myself.\u201d Getting through to the first round of the main draw will guarantee Kubler at least 62,000 euros ($93,000) to further fund his revival. But he will have to wait until all the other qualifiers have been completed on Friday to learn who his first-round opponent will be. Potential nightmarish opponents first up for him in the draw could be luminaries like Alexander Zverev, Felix Auger-Aliassime and Carlos Alcaraz. \u201cObviously I\u2019d love to win as many rounds as I could but, to be honest, I just want to play people where I learn things about myself,\u201d he said. \u201cIf I play any of the big names, win or lose, I\u2019m going to learn what I need to improve, learn what type of player I am, maybe experience some pretty cool moments. Winning a couple of rounds, that\u2019d be nice, but anything that comes my way, I\u2019ll try my best and hopefully learn from it.\u201d Kubler could be joined as a qualifier by compatriot Seone Mendez, who has never been in any grand slam women\u2019s main draw but will have a shot in Friday\u2019s third-round match against Canadian Rebecca Marino."

                    "body": "Universities have failed incoming international students and exacerbated problems for those already struggling to find a place to live by selling off student accommodation to private providers during the Covid period, student advocates say.\nAbout 40,000 international students are expected to rush to Australia in time for first-semester classes, after the Chinese government on Monday announced a snap ban in recognising online degrees obtained from foreign institutions. Students unable to access visas, flights or accommodation can seek an exemption from the ban but only after their degree is completed.\nBut once they arrive, they will face an incredibly tight housing market.\nA number of providers sold property during the pandemic. Student accommodation remains some of the most highly priced accommodation in major capital cities, far exceeding median unit rents for significantly smaller offerings \u2013 and many are at capacity.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a failure on the part of universities,\u201d the National Union of Students president, Bailey Riley, said.\nSelling off property\nThe University of Sydney sold off more than $70m of property in 2021, including $31m of \u201cend of life\u201d terraces that provided some of the most affordable close-to-campus accommodation in the area.\nOptions are currently being explored for its International House, which has ceased operating, including converting the site into a larger accommodation facility.\nIn 2021, the University of Wollongong placed three of its assets on the market including Weerona College, now operating as privately owned student accommodation, and Marketview, which is operating as a hotel. Its International College was withdrawn from sale.\n\nA spokesperson for the University of Wollongong said the university\u2019s 2,278 student beds were at capacity and demand for accommodation was \u201cextremely high\u201d \u2013 in large part due to the tight rental market.\n\u201cAs we are unlikely to be able to meet the demand for on-campus accommodation, we are working with external accommodation providers to determine their availability to assist our students,\u201d they said.\n\u201cThe decision ensured the provision of university accommodation did not affect UOW\u2019s financial sustainability, and our capacity to deliver high-quality teaching and research programs and strengthen support for students during the pandemic.\u201d\nMeanwhile the University of Technology Sydney (UTS) sold three accommodation buildings with 428-bed capacity to private provider Scape for an estimated $95m. The price of accommodation in the building increased 15-20% following the sale.\nA spokesperson for UTS said it was a \u201cdifficult decision\u201d in 2021 to sell one-third of its student beds but was necessary to \u201cpreserve staff jobs, and to avoid impacting the university\u2019s teaching and research\u201d over the pandemic.\nRiley said member unions had been contacted by international students in \u201cdire\u201d situations, who were frustrated by the lack of help they received from their universities in securing accommodation, and extremely high prices providers were charging.\n\nSign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup\n\nIn Melbourne, a large studio apartment at a Scape complex on inner-city Swanston Street would set a student back $759 a week \u2013 about $300 more than many equivalent current listings on commercial real estate sites, and 57% higher than the city\u2019s median unit rent of $482 a week. A single bed in an eight-person apartment-based Scape dorm would cost a student upwards of $477 a week.\nAn Iglu complex in Flagstaff Gardens offered studio apartment rooms for rent between $509 and $559, with the most expensive offering \u201copening windows\u201d and a double bed as some of its most attractive features.\nIn Sydney, Scape\u2019s top-end offerings include a 21 sq metre studio apartment for $749 a week. Sydney\u2019s median unit rent in the December 2022 quarter was $616.\nAt the bottom end, Scape was charging $369 per person for a twin room in an apartment shared with seven other people.\nAt the time of writing, most of these options, even the most expensive ones, were full.\n\u201c[Private providers] typically exploit students with higher rents and ridiculous bonds which leave students with a lot of stress and worry,\u201d Riley said.\n\u201cUniversities should have the responsibility to look after students but they\u2019re leaving it to providers.\u201d\nGuardian Australia sent specific questions to multiple student accommodation companies which did not respond directly, but provided a collective response through the Student Accommodation Council, an industry lobby group run by executives from some of the biggest entities.\nThe spokesperson said the prices for student accommodation often included utilities, security and access to communal areas such as study spaces, and sometimes gyms.\n\u201cOur members pride themselves on giving students safe, professionally managed, and student-led communities in which to live that offer the best experience possible,\u201d the spokesperson said.\nStudent accommodation at capacity\nA former University of Sydney student, who asked not to be named, lived in a single room run by the institution at a rate of $356 a week through the 2020 lockdown until 2021. The double bed was squashed into the corner of the room, kitchen and bathrooms were communal and heating and cooling was a wall heater and a fan.\n\u201cChannels for feedback were very limited \u2026 the room is quite cramped and can get stuffy on a hot day with no AC,\u201d the student said.\n\u201cCommunal kitchens and bathrooms are definitely not a setup everyone can tolerate. Cleanliness and upkeep \u2026 depended on the self-discipline of residents \u2026 and availability of maintenance and cleaning staff, which could be lacking.\u201d\nA University of Sydney spokesperson said the health and wellbeing of students was its \u201chighest priority\u201d and resident complaints were taken seriously.\nIt said the terraces sold by the university were not suitable for student accommodation without serious investment and it had instead chosen to redevelop the centre of its Darlington campus for housing.\nOf about 2,400 places in dormitory accommodation offered by the university \u2013 including Sydney University Village of which the university has a minority share \u2013 all were at capacity.\n\u201cWe remain committed to providing high-quality and affordable accommodation for our students and our accommodations remain some of the cheapest in the market,\u201d they said.\n\u2018Ripe for exploitation\u2019\nAlan Morris, an urban and housing studies scholar at UTS, said the situation for international students had \u201cdefinitely worsened\u201d since he first studied their precarious rental situation in 2019.\nThat research, published last year, found that among the bottom 25% of students, many were in overcrowded housing, with unclean shared spaces, mould issues, broken appliances and bathrooms in poor condition, all of which often affected their studies.\nMorris said the first step was ensuring international students understood their rights as tenants \u2013 as they were often \u201cripe for exploitation\u201d. The second was investment in affordable housing to avoid a \u201cspiral of decline\u201d leading to poorer academic standards and students simply deciding to study elsewhere.\n\u201cFor a lot of international students it\u2019s going to be an impossible situation\u201d, he said.\nMorris said accommodation costs listed by popular companies of up to $900 a week for one-bed rentals was \u201cmind blowing\u201d and an \u201cabsolute scandal\u201d.\n\u201cUniversities are standing with arms folded and seem to have no capacity to control these prices,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s no duty of care on the education sector to ensure students are housed \u2026 students in precarious situations are going to struggle and even the middle section if they don\u2019t find employment.\n\u201cWe could see a lot marginally housed and homeless.\u201d\n\nTenants Victoria\u2019s director of community engagement, Farah Farouque, said the organisation remained concerned about the welfare of international students.\n\u201cIn 2020, international students were among the first to feel the impacts of the pandemic. Many had gone home for the holidays and couldn\u2019t return but their cars were parked in their rented home, their personal effects remained in bedrooms and they had ongoing obligations on leases. Others, who were still living here, faced mounting unpaid bills and had no recourse to the income support available during the crisis,\u201d Farouque said.\n\u201cInternational students are now returning to a very tight rental market which means a new set of pressures on this group.\n\u201cSome students have to resort to unregistered, overcrowded rooming houses for accommodation, often forced to share bedrooms with other students, which meets the definition of homelessness.\u201d\nThe president of the National Tertiary Education Union, Dr Alison Barnes, said it was \u201cabsolutely crucial\u201d for students to find appropriate and affordable accommodation.\nA spokesperson for the Department of Education said education providers had \u201cresponsibilities\u201d to international students to help their adjustment to living in Australia and support their wellbeing.\n\u201cThe department is working closely with the education sector and state and territory governments to help overcome the logistical challenges associated with this change,\u201d they said.\n\nThis article was corrected on 7 February 2023. An earlier version said the University of Sydney had sold its international housing block.\n\n"

                    "body": "The US was poised to set the Taliban on the path to diplomatic recognition before the plan was derailed by the Afghan rulers\u2019 sudden U-turn on a promise to allow girls\u2019 education, the Guardian understands. The group prompted international outrage and confusion on Wednesday when it reneged on a deal to allow teenage girls to go to secondary school, just a week after the education ministry announced that schools would open for all students.  US diplomats had been so optimistic that the Taliban would make good on the promise that a joint event had been planned ahead of this weekend\u2019s Doha Forum in Qatar that would have set the process in motion to grant diplomatic recognition to the group. A seat had been reserved for the Taliban at a panel at the forum dedicated to girls\u2019 education in which a Taliban representative would have addressed the role of women with Afghan female activists. The sudden reversal undermined the argument that a more \u201cmoderate\u201d leadership now dominates the Taliban, and such optimism was further clouded this weekend when the group ordered Afghanistan television stations to remove BBC news bulletins in Pashto, Persian and Uzbek. In a statement on Sunday the BBC said: \u201cThis is a worrying development at a time of uncertainty and turbulence for the people of Afghanistan. More than 6 million Afghans consume the BBC\u2019s independent and impartial journalism on TV every week.\u201d Western officials made it clear that diplomatic recognition will be impossible unless the decision on girls\u2019 education is reversed. Thomas West, the US special envoy for Afghanistan, said: \u201cI was surprised by the turnaround this last Wednesday and the world has reacted to it by condemning this move. It is a breach first and foremost of the Afghan people\u2019s trust. \u201cI believe hope is not all lost. I am hopeful we will see a reversal of that decision in the coming days.\u201d But West defended the US engagement with the Taliban saying that a complete diplomatic rupture would mean abandoning 40 million Afghans amid growing concerns over a possible famine in the country. \u201cWe are talking about the modalities of an urgent humanitarian response, the need for more than a humanitarian response \u2026 a professionalisation of the central bank so that the international financial community can begin to have confidence in it, we are talking about terrorism and we are talking about women\u2019s rights. \u201cOne of the first times we sat down in October in a formal setting they had a request of us: \u2018Please put our civil servants \u2013 500,000 \u2013 back to work.\u2019 We thought a logical place to start given the sector resonated so much in the international community was education. We had requests of them, as well. Number one, women and girls could attend at all levels across large swathes of Afghanistan. Number two, we wanted to see a monitoring mechanism, and third, there be a serious and rigorous curriculum. \u201cOver the following months the international community received the necessary assurances, and more importantly the Afghan people were told on 23 March we would see girls attend secondary education and that did not occur,\u201d West said. Hosna Jalil, a former interior minister, was one of many Afghan women at Doha to claim the Taliban will not be able to keep a lid on the demand for education. She said the last 20 years had not been a waste but left a positive legacy. \u201cWe facilitated a generation, two-thirds of the population, that knows what a better life looks like. That is why we will not give up. They are loud, they believe in freedom and democracy.\u201d Malala Yousafzai, who won the 2014 Nobel peace prize for her fight for all children\u2019s right to education, told the forum that times had changed since the Taliban first banned girls\u2019 education in 1996.   \u201cIt is much harder this time \u2013 that is because women have seen what it means to be educated, what it means to be empowered. This time is going to be much harder for the Taliban to maintain the ban on girls\u2019 education. They are learning in the hide-outs. They are protesting on the streets. This ban will not last forever. They were waiting outside the school gates in their uniforms and they were crying. Seeking education is a duty of every Muslim,\u201d she said. Dalia Fahmhy, an Afghan professor of political science, said in 1999 no girls were in secondary schools. \u201cWithin 15 years later there were 3.7 million girls. Over that period a thousand women became business owners. This cannot be curtailed. We live in a digital age and 68% have cellphones and 22% are connected to each other and to the world. This cannot be curtailed. Twenty-seven per cent of the parliament were women.\u201d"

Last summer you watched as Marcus Rashford, at the climax of that sulphurous July night, took a straight run-up, stuttered, and then, as Gianluigi Donnarumma fell to your left, dragged his penalty to your right.\nYou like the young man, his obvious decency, his stance on various social issues \u2013 and you are an English goalframe after all. You wanted him to score. You tried to just stretch a bit further, to widen your stance, but your feet were rooted and the ball cannoned off the base of your post and away. If only he had struck it three inches more centrally you probably could have helped it in and, if you had, England would probably be European champions and Rashford might not have had such a miserable season; Manchester United might not feel like quite such a faded force in need of desperate reconstitution.\n\nOn Saturday C\u00e9sar Azpilicueta\u2019s penalty clipped the outside of your left post and went wide, and immediately Thiago Alc\u00e2ntara\u2019s effort nudged the inside of your right post and went in.

What a sense that goalframe must have of the arbitrariness of human destiny, how life can teeter on a knife edge before taking a decisive plunge in one direction or the other.\n\nIf Chelsea had won, we would now be talking of a spirit born of adversity \u2013 albeit an adversity characteristic of football\u2019s age of high decadence, the crisis of oligarchal funding being turned off when the invasion of a sovereign state on the other side of the continent finally persuades people that merrily lapping up cash from this highly litigious associate of a brutal authoritarian leader might not quite be on.\n(As the Cup celebrated its 150th birthday with a bizarre kick-off time, the booing of Abide With Me and a DJ set that obstructed the view from part of the press box, you wonder what Charles W Alcock, the Sunderland-born Old Harrovian whose idea it was, might have made of it all. \u201cLook, Charles, there\u2019s some really good news: your competition will still be going on in 2022. But I have to warn you, it\u2019s moved on a bit \u2013 not really a giggle for public schoolboys any more, more a theatre for soft-power gameplaying between petro-states and American capital.\u201d)\nThere might be some grumbling about another duff performance from Romelu Lukaku and the weird striking dearth that meant a 14-minute cameo as an emergency centre-forward from Ruben Loftus-Cheek: how bad must he be at penalties that he had to be withdrawn? And how bad must Ross Barkley, who Thomas Tuchel said was brought on for Loftus-Cheek because of his penalty record, now be in open play that he could not be risked for 14 minutes?\nBut there would have been a sense that the storm had passed, that the foundations remained for the Todd Boehly-led consortium to build on.\nFor Liverpool there would have been a nagging sense that this season, which could yet in terms of trophies won be the best enjoyed by any English men\u2019s club, might end up like a typical Don Revie season at Leeds in the late 60s and early 70s: fatigue-induced near misses, great memories and not much in the trophy cabinet.\n\nKlopp acknowledged that winning the league looks unlikely now and, with injury doubts over Fabinho, Virgil van Dijk and Mohamed Salah, the buildup to the Champions League final must have been pessimistic.\nJust a League Cup? After playing every possible game this season, after keeping the possibility of a quadruple alive longer than any side has before? However great the achievement to have come so close, that would have been an extreme disappointment.\n\nLiverpool came within inches of defeat \u2013 and yet the truth is the final never felt that close. Liverpool may have drawn four times with Chelsea this season, but they are very obviously a better side. In part that is down to Klopp, to his charisma, his organisational skills and the belief he instils. But he also credited neuro11, a German neuroscience company that has been working with Liverpool for more than a year, for the penalty success: the team\u2019s record of 17 scored from 18 attempts in shootouts this season suggests he is right to do so.\nThat is the other side of Klopp. His personality tends to draw most of the attention but he is also extremely receptive to specialists who can offer a competitive advantage, from neuroscientists to data analysts to throw-in coaches. That is one of the reasons Liverpool have not really made a poor signing since Christian Benteke in 2015. The mentality and the thrilling football have an advanced scientific underpinning.\nThe goalframe, with its awareness of angles, may understand how contingent everything is, how dependent results can be on the fractional movement of a piece of leather. But behind all that lies a great science that helps tweak those margins. Preparation plus luck equals destiny."

HuntOut nowA glossy South Korean spy thriller with lashings of highly kinetic action, directed by Squid Game star Lee Jung-jae, Hunt may not be massively original, but who needs original when there\u2019s a no-good double-crossing mole to be tracked down in the upper echelons of the secret service? LivingOut nowWith a script from author Kazuo Ishiguro, updating and reworking Kurosawa\u2019s 1952 Japanese classic Ikiru into a western context, directed by the talented South African Oliver Hermanus, and starring Bill Nighy in his best role in at least a decade, Living plays a rare hand with consummate skill.

While there\u2019s likely to be a rendition of Silent Night, also expect a run through of their untouchable late 90s/early 00s bops and ballads. Michael Cragg N-Dubz7 November to 6 December; tour starts Newcastle upon TyneWhen tabloid mainstays Tulisa and Dappy, plus rapper Fazer, announced their comeback after an 11-year hiatus, few saw it leading to this 23-date arena tour, including four dates at London\u2019s O2 arena.

Kurt Elling and Sheila Jordan, and powerful saxophonist Binker Golding are among other highlights. John Fordham ***  Going out: Art Strange ClayHayward Gallery, London, to 8 JanuaryThis exhibition goes potty for ceramics, with good reason. The ancient craft of shaping and firing clay has found a surprisingly cutting-edge place in contemporary art. The wildly playful creations of Lindsey Mendick and Klara Kristalova (work pictured, above) feature here as well as the very different, more controlled conceptual pottery of Edmund de Waal. Elizabeth PriceThe Hunterian, Glasgow, 11 November to 16 AprilThe gothic imagination of this excellent artist weaves horror and history to disturbing effect. Glasgow\u2019s industrial heritage provides the facts for her first exhibition in Scotland. As well as new video art, she has created a textile with Edinburgh\u2019s Dovecot Studios. Expect an unsettling history, seen through a glass darkly.

Not me anyway, but this exhibition shows how Mark Leckey, Lucy McKenzie, Mark Wallinger, Leo Fitzmaurice and more have been inspired by fashion-conscious football supporters from the 1970s to the 90s. ExecutionsMuseum of London Docklands, to 16 AprilArtists were drawn to the condemned cell in Newgate Prison to sketch those about to be hanged, and one of the most moving exhibits here is James Thornhill\u2019s portrait of Jack Sheppard who cheated the hangman before his eventual execution.

Lyndsey Winship Sara PascoeBeck Theatre, Hayes, 10 November; Grove Theatre, Dunstable, 11 November; touring to 22 AprilFor her latest show, Pascoe is applying her strain of goofily cerebral comedy to the subject of success. Not just the career kind \u2013 although fame, something she\u2019s craved since adolescence, features prominently \u2013 but in her personal life too, as she looks back on an extended struggle with infertility. Rachel Aroesti ***   Staying in: Streaming The English10 November, 9pm, BBC Two &amp; iPlayerThis wild western (above) from Hugo Blick stars Emily Blunt as a woman who teams up with a Pawnee man to avenge the death of her child. The tone is droll, the aesthetics are out-there and the violence is non-stop.  The Crown9 November, NetflixThe royal saga\u2019s interesting relationship with the truth may have made headlines, but fans know Peter Morgan\u2019s clever, original and relentlessly entertaining series has always been about imaginative insights rather than familiar facts. Season five plunges into the 1990s, an era that began with an annus horribilis and went downhill from there. Mammals11 November, Amazon Prime VideoIn light of recent omelette-based outbursts, now seems like an especially bad time for James Corden to relaunch his acting career with this drama about a chef with an unravelling marriage. Thankfully, Mammals has other significant selling points \u2013 not least its writer, the feted playwright Jez Butterworth. Save Our Squad With David Beckham9 November, Disney+Speaking of public favour: between Qatar-related controversy and royal queueing, the Beckham brand has been on a rollercoaster lately. Yet this sweet new docuseries \u2013 in which Becks coaches a struggling youth team in his native east London \u2013 seems like the perfect way to recement his good-guy image.

Big Joanie \u2013 Back HomeOut nowThe British punk trio, AKA guitarist Stephanie Phillips, bassist Estella Adeyeri, and drummer Chardine Taylor-Stone, return with their second album of roughly hewn but endlessly satisfying alt-rock. While the muscular Happier Still channels Nirvana\u2019s churning and frayed emotion, there are also lean excursions into new wave as on the juddering Sainted. Phoenix \u2013 Alpha ZuluOut nowRecorded in the Mus\u00e9e des Arts D\u00e9coratifs in the Louvre, French quartet Phoenix\u2019s seventh album finds them returning to the decadent indie-disco anthems of old. Recent single Tonight, a breezy collaboration with Vampire Weekend\u2019s Ezra Koenig, parties like it\u2019s 2009, while the lithe title track skirts the hem of funky.

                    "body": "The theory goes that teams seeking European success must first encounter failures and in the case of Sale it could just work in their favour on Sunday. Alex Sanderson\u2019s side are the considerable underdogs when they face Racing 92 in their space-age stadium in Paris but, having fallen in France in the quarter-finals last season, Sale are hoping previous heartache will equip them to overcome one the favourites for the title. The aforementioned theory was repeatedly referenced by Saracens at the time they would reach the knockout stages, then the final in 2014, before lifting the title in 2016. They would call it \u201cpounding the rock\u201d \u2013 the idea being that it will eventually break \u2013 and if Sanderson is getting tired of talking about his European glory days with Sarries, there are lessons to be learned.  In addition, Sale have this week been seeking permission to take control of the giant screen at one end of Racing\u2019s La Defense arena and play motivational videos during their hour-long captain\u2019s run there on Saturday. The idea is that catching yourself on a giant screen can be distracting if it is something you have not encountered before and Sale want to leave no stone unturned in their preparation to face Finn Russell et al. \u201cI don\u2019t think you have to [lose before you can win] but I think it is proven that most teams find it difficult, or statistically speaking there is an element of learning,\u201d said Sanderson. \u201cOf being able to not be distracted by the occasion, by the noise. The more you get used to it the less stressful it is. \u201cIf you have won once or twice before, and realise it doesn\u2019t really matter in terms of your culture, your security of your job livelihood, it has less of an effect of stress and you are able to perform better for longer and make better decisions. There is the neuroscience behind it. The more you do it, the better you adapt to it, the less stressful it is, the better you perform. So I guess there is truth in it. If you have done it, been there before, you have got a better chance of doing better the time after.\u201d Helping Sale\u2019s cause, Tom Curry makes his first start for the club since picking up a hamstring injury during the Six Nations while Manu Tuilagi is back in the side, having been rested for last weekend\u2019s victory over Newcastle. \u201cHe is well primed. Manu is an English-Samoan thoroughbred,\u201d added Sanderson. \u201cIt was purely conservational on Manu\u2019s part last week, just to keep him fresh and not risk injury and make sure his loading is up there. He is better than he would have been if he had played last week.\u201d  Dean Richards, meanwhile, is to step down as Newcastle\u2019s director of rugby at the end of the season but will continue in a consultancy role. Richards has spent the last decade at Kingston Park as part of a managerial career that began in 1998 and has included successful spells at Leicester, Grenoble and Harlequins."

                    "body": "Marine experts have warned more sharks will be swimming in estuaries at this time of year after a 16-year-old girl was killed in an attack in Perth\u2019s Swan River. The girl, identified as Stella Berry, was pulled from the water on Saturday afternoon with critical injuries, understood to have been to her legs, but despite the efforts of paramedics she died at the scene. The headmaster of Perth\u2019s Scotch College, Alec O\u2019Connell, confirmed the death in a letter seen by Guardian Australia and sent to the school community.  \u201cIt is with deep regret and sadness that I write to inform you that the young woman whose life was tragically lost yesterday at North Fremantle was Stella Berry, daughter of Sophie Berry, one of our valued members of staff,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI am sharing this communication with you today with the permission of the Berry family. I ask that you keep Sophie, Matt, and Mae in your prayers at this time of unimaginable sorrow and loss.\u201d O\u2019Connell also confirmed that several male students at the school, who were friends of Stella, were with her at the time of the tragedy \u201cand, in that context, were the first respondents\u201d. On Sunday the fisheries minister, Don Punch, said it was too early to confirm the type of shark behind the attack, but it \u201cwas likely\u201d a bull shark. \u201cWe do know that bull sharks, particularly, do enter estuaries and freshwater river systems, so it is likely that may be the case,\u201d he told the ABC.  Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup  He said it was the first fatal shark attack in the Swan River in 100 years, with the last attack in 1923. \u201cThere\u2019s only been six recorded historical attacks in the river, and this would make it seven,\u201d he said. Although an investigation was still under way, the director of higher degree research biology at Macquarie University, Prof Culum Brown, said bull sharks use estuaries at this time of year to breed. \u201cThis time of year the bull sharks are in the river more than normal, it\u2019s the breeding period,\u201d Brown said. \u201cThe females move into the river and the males chase them.\u201d Since the 1990s shark fatalities have decreased and in 2022 there was just one fatal shark attack across the country, according to The Australian Shark Incident Database, collated by Sydney\u2019s Taronga Conservation Society. \u201cIn terms of the number of fatalities, there are on average between zero and two for the whole of Australia each year,\u201d Brown said. \u201cIt\u2019s rare people get killed.\u201d Over social media people called for the Western Australia population of bull sharks to be culled, saying they were growing in number. But Brown said this was misinformation, often spread after a fatal shark attack. \u201cThere\u2019s actually a probability of extinction; their populations are declining,\u201d Brown said. \u201cThere will always be this call to kill the sharks and remove the risk of a shark attack, but in terms of risk you\u2019d be better off not getting your car,\u201d he said. Brown said the number of shark incidents had risen, with advancements in technology, such as drones, meaning more Australians were likely to spot a shark. \u201cPeople now see sharks from drones so it gets reported; that\u2019s mainly the reason why the number of incidents is going up,\u201d he said. \u201cThe number of bites has gone up a little bit, but that\u2019s because of the fact many of us live in the cities, by the oceans and increasingly we\u2019re in the ocean year-round now.\u201d Dr Vanessa Pirotta, a wildlife scientist at Macquarie University, said authorities would investigate to try to determine the type of shark that was behind the attack, but stressed these incidents were very rare. \u201cWe don\u2019t know what animal it was. It\u2019s very rare in that area,\u201d Pirotta said. \u201cThis doesn\u2019t bring comfort to the family, but what you need to know is that this is an area connected to an ocean, there\u2019s a chance or possibility you might have marine animals up the waterway,\u201d she said. She said the safest thing people could do was swim at a patrolled beach, and check for updates or warnings with the relevant authorities. \u201cIt\u2019s summer, it\u2019s hot, and people are still in holiday mode,\u201d Pirotta said. \u201cSwimming in a well-patrolled area is the safest. Surf lifesaving is doing a great job this year keeping us safe. \u201cStick to areas where there is beach safety or at least a lot of eyes on the land and water.\u201d"

Twenty years later, Sacha Baron Cohen captured him with his hands down his pants and cameras rolled as dye ran down his sweaty face. America laughed.  Before he was mayor, Giuliani was US attorney for the southern district of New York and US associate attorney general under Ronald Reagan. He frog-marched wayward bankers across trading floors, to the delight of all except Wall Street and civil libertarians. As mayor, Giuliani ruled the city as only a former prosecutor could. He demanded loyalty and brooked no dissent. Andrew Kirtzman\u2019s first biography was called Rudy Giuliani: Emperor of the City. In his second, the author describes an \u201cauthoritarian\u201d mayor. According to her sister, the mayor\u2019s mother, Helen Giuliani, \u201cliked\u201d Mussolini. Her husband, Harold, was a stick-up man and leg-breaker for the mob and did prison time at Sing Sing. Under Giuliani, New Yorkers felt safer than they would under Bill de Blasio or, now, Eric Adams. But Giuliani broadcast disdain for the city\u2019s minorities and lacked the temperament, capacity for consensus and deep pockets of Michael Bloomberg, his billionaire successor. All too often, Giuliani simply acted like a thug. After 9/11, he ran for president, made money as a lawyer then became a Trump flunky. Now, thanks to his work to advance the former president\u2019s big lie about election fraud, he is being targeted by prosecutors in Fulton county, Georgia and his law license is suspended. Think of a malevolent Inspector Clouseau.  Apparently, Giuliani is conscious of his decline. On the other hand, he has said: \u201cI don\u2019t care about my legacy. I\u2019ll be dead.\u201d That quote leads Kirtzman\u2019s introduction. As a reporter on NY1, Time Warner\u2019s 24-hour local cable news channel, Kirtzman covered Giuliani from the campaign trail to city hall. On 11 September 2001, he was there with the mayor in lower Manhattan. He witnessed Giuliani\u2019s strides, his missteps and his spectacular collapse. Kirtzman\u2019s new subtitle, The Rise and Tragic Fall of America\u2019s Mayor, says it all. The book is masterful and engrossing. It is girded by more than 40 pages of endnotes. The author and David Holley, his researcher, have performed yeoman work. They capture what made the man tick and what led to his fall from grace. Kirtzman\u2019s critique is leavened with bittersweet impressions and references to Giuliani\u2019s accomplishments. On election night 2020 and after, the former mayor helped Trump resist the will of the people. The social fabric was theirs to torch and shred. Giuliani\u2019s self-righteousness complemented Trump\u2019s refusal to acknowledge defeat. The soon-to-be ex-president offered Giuliani another opportunity to seize center stage. If Trump wouldn\u2019t name him secretary of state, he could at least cosplay as a presidential lawyer. \u2022\u2022\u2022 Kirtzman\u2019s book ranks with other essential biographies such as Rudy! by the late and great investigative reporter Wayne Barrett and the more favorable The Prince of the City by Fred Siegel, an urban historian and Giuliani adviser. Kirtzman gets Judith Nathan, Giuliani\u2019s third ex-wife, to truly dish the dirt. She says Giuliani\u2019s crushing failure in the 2008 presidential primary left him broken and clutching the bottle. She credits Trump for providing shelter. \u201cWe moved into Mar-a-Lago and Donald kept our secret,\u201d she says. As Kirtzman puts it, Giuliani \u201cdreamed of becoming president from a young age, [but] blew his big moment when it arrived\u201d. In the torrid aftermath, he spoke to therapists but, to quote Nathan, was \u201calways falling shitfaced somewhere\u201d. The couple are divorced but their antipathy continues to smolder. Characteristically, Giuliani has offered a different explanation for his stumbles and falls. He played baseball as a youngster and developed \u201ccatcher\u2019s knee\u201d. Does anyone really believe Giuliani was ever a budding Yogi Berra? Anthony Carbonetti, Giuliani\u2019s chief of staff at city hall, is also a family friend. He also talked to Kirtzman, targeting Nathan while delivering a backhanded defense of his former boss. He told Nathan to \u201cstay the fuck\u201d out of Giuliani\u2019s life. To Kirtzman, he opines: \u201cIf you spent an extensive amount of time with that woman, you\u2019d drink a lot.\u201d  Carbonetti became a conduit between Trump and Giuliani \u2026 and, with other members of Giuliani\u2019s retinue, a lobbyist for Qatar. As Kirtzman makes clear, Giuliani was never short on zeal. For Trump, he sought to become the second Roy Cohn, Trump\u2019s all-time favorite lawyer. From seeking dirt in Ukraine to falsely blaming Dominion Voting Systems for Trump\u2019s loss, Giuliani did it all. His capacity for self-abasement was bottomless.  In the aftermath of the January 6 insurrection, Maria Ryan, a Giuliani associate, sought a pardon and the presidential medal of freedom. She also attempted to get him paid. She failed. Giuliani forgot that even as Cohn lay in hospital, dying of Aids, Trump cast him aside. \u201cI can\u2019t believe he\u2019s doing this to me,\u201d Cohn said. \u201cDonald pisses ice water.\u201d Giuliani has testified before a Fulton county grand jury and the House January 6 committee. He is a defendant in defamation suits brought by Dominion and Smartmatic, another election machines company. In Trumpworld, Maga means Make America Great Again. It might also mean \u201cMaking attorneys get attorneys\u201d. Kirtzman\u2019s biography sums things up. Despite it all, two years after the 2020 election he refused to concede, Trump remains the frontrunner for the Republican nomination in 2024. \u201cGiuliani, on the other hand, [is] finished in every conceivable way.\u201d  Giuliani: The Rise and Tragic Fall of America\u2019s Mayor is published in the US by Simon &amp; Schuster "

                    "body": "Diane Demetre gained some notoriety as an author of a series of erotic fiction novels and a couple of murder mysteries. But her most recent writings strike a very different tone. Demetre, who ran for the Liberal Democrats at the 2022 federal election, claims in social media posts that Covid is a \u201cbehavioural conditioning experiment\u201d and warns about \u201cthe totalitarian rule of a group of globalists who want to play god\u201d. She also urges her followers to get involved in party politics and help sway preselections.  \u201cWe must take action now, recruit, pre-select, endorse and vote for candidates who will not be corrupted \u2026 act now, get involved and make your internal vote count,\u201d she wrote on Facebook last year. In October, the Gold Coast businesswoman invited the Queensland Liberal National party senator, Gerard Rennick, to speak at an event hosted by her new networking business, dare2care Australia, which also runs get-rich seminars and presentations by those hostile to commonly accepted climate science.  Sign up for a weekly email featuring our best reads  Rennick addressed about 200 people at the Gold Coast Croatia Sports Centre hall at Carrara. In his speech he encouraged the crowd to become more politically engaged and have \u201ca seat at the table\u201d. He also brought a pile of LNP membership forms. Guardian Australia understands multiple people who attended the meeting, including Demetre, subsequently attempted to join the LNP but were blocked by the party administration. Sources say LNP officials have become increasingly alert to attempts by the rightwing fringe, since the federal election, to build influence within the party. Also blocked have been membership applications from multiple people known to have campaigned for minor parties at the 2022 election, as part of a stronger stance taken by the new administration to \u2013 in the words of one source \u2013 \u201ckeep out the cookers\u201d.  Bernard Gaynor, a controversial former party member linked to several small rightwing political movements, and who has made anti-gay and anti-Muslim statements, was also refused membership. Particular concerns have been raised internally about Rennick, who is expected to struggle to win LNP preselection when his term ends at the next election, but whose public following and online presence has grown substantially after claims that people had suffered side-effects from Covid-19 vaccines. Claims shared by Rennick have previously been disputed by expert medical bodies such as the Therapeutic Goods Administration. Stronger stance on vetting potential members Political analysts say the 2022 federal election result, the rise of centrist independents, and the fracturing of the political right presents a broad ideological challenge for the LNP as a mainstream force \u2013 one that is more acute given the party was already struggling with an identity crisis. Many minor political actors who had splintered rightwards \u2013 including conservative Christians and anti-lockdown protesters who gravitated to a coterie of unconventional small parties \u2013 have been picking over the federal result, having failed to make a significant impact from the fringe. Duncan McDonnell, a professor of politics at Griffith University, says the border \u201cbetween the edge conservative right and the radical right\u201d is often porous. \u201cIt\u2019s not an unusual phenomenon,\u201d McDonnell says.  \u201cThere are people who would have been involved in One Nation, the Lib Dems who would have been disillusioned [by the federal election result] and they\u2019re looking at what are their options in terms of efficacy and translating activism into results. \u201cThat\u2019s a problem for the Liberal party nationally because [shifting further right is] not a winning strategy electorally.\u201d The former LNP state leader, now mayor of Goondiwindi, Lawrence Springborg, last year assumed control of the party administration from a group, known internally as the \u201ccabal\u201d, which included officials with ongoing ties to the billionaire Clive Palmer. That Palmer controlled his own fringe political party became a fundamental problem. One of that group, the former LNP president Bruce McIver, has previously said that social conservatives who didn\u2019t like candidates \u201cshould get all their mates to get involved [in the party]\u2026 that\u2019s what democracy is\u201d. Under Springborg, sources say, the party is taking a more active approach to vetting potential members. However, this presents a particularly acute challenge given the way some existing members of the LNP operate in broad conservative circles. One party member said there is \u201ca lot of discomfort\u201d about the way these circles operate, including the extent of crossover with notional political rivals and those deemed persona non grata by the LNP. Last year, former senator Amanda Stoker spoke at an event hosted by the Australian Taxpayers Alliance, a group with links to the Liberal Democrats and which employs Barclay McGain, who was forced to resign after a series of offensive social media posts. A group of LNP members known internally as the \u201cChristian Soldiers\u201d \u2013 having recruited widely in recent years \u2013 are still licking their wounds after Stoker was relegated on the ticket at the 2022 election. She subsequently lost her seat. Some eyebrows were raised within the party when the Australian Christian Lobby hired as its Queensland director Rob Norman, a Pentecostal pastor from Adelaide who has previously told parishioners it was their \u201cmission\u201d to join political parties. InDaily reported that Norman argued party membership gave churchgoers \u201cthe right to vote at meetings, and that will include the preselection of local candidates\u201d. South Australian Liberal party senator Alex Antic, who had run a \u201cbelieve in blue\u201d Christian recruitment drive in the state, was present for that speech.  In the immediate aftermath of the federal election, Norman wrote on his personal blog that he held \u201cparticular concern\u201d for the conservative side of politics. \u201cWhenever we have a weak Liberal Party, conservatives tend to splinter into a multitude of pieces,\u201d he said. \u201cFor Christians who care about the economic, social, and moral state of our nation we must be prepared to enter the political world as \u2018prophets\u2019 and \u2018missionaries\u2019, bringing truth and redemption.\u201d Speaking to Guardian Australia, Demetre said she couldn\u2019t explain why members of her networking group were rejected by the LNP, but confirmed she had applied for membership \u201cto give a voice to mainstream Australia\u201d. \u201cAs far as I know it was knocked back because I ran for the Liberal Democrats,\u201d she said. \u201cIf the Liberal party is looking for strong female candidates, they\u2019re not getting what they need, they\u2019re not getting female candidates who have run for other parties who want to work with the broad church party.\u201d The LNP, Rennick and Gaynor declined to answer Guardian Australia questions."

                    "body": "Parents struggling to afford ballooning school costs are increasingly turning to buy now, pay later providers, and advocates say there needs to be more support from schools to avoid families falling into debt. Dianne Giblin, the chief executive of the Australian Council of State School Organisations, said an increasing number of families say they have used buy now, pay later to afford school items as the cost of public education blows \u201cout of proportion\u201d. The amount of parents seeking loans for school costs such as uniforms, books, stationery and computers grew by more than 130% from 2018 to 2022, with the average loan being $1,150, NAB said last week.  One of these parents is Laura Ireland, whose child attends a school in Victoria. She said she spent last week figuring out how she was going to afford to buy her daughter a $700 laptop and ended up resorting to Afterpay. \u201cI was grateful it was an option, but in saying that I\u2019m not going to be grateful when I get my first couple of pays for the year and that money is being taken out and there\u2019s like $2 in my bank account,\u201d she said. Ireland purchased the laptop using Afterpay after she received a letter from the school saying there was a limited number of school laptops, so children who didn\u2019t have one would likely have to share. \u201cThere was no \u2018if you\u2019re having financial difficulty give us a call and we can give you some options\u2019,\u201d she said. \u201cI then felt like my child would stand out if they didn\u2019t have what everyone else has.\u201d  Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup  Jenny Davidson, the chief executive of the Council of Single Mothers and their Children, which supports those in its network struggling with back-to-school costs, said this was an issue the organisation often heard about. \u201cSome schools aren\u2019t doing a good job of understanding what it means to be in financial hardship,\u201d she said. \u201cSome schools are better than others, and I think schools with more disadvantaged students manage this better, but the reality is that we are a long, long way from education being free in Australia.\u201d Davidson said that parents did not always feel comfortable asking for assistance and sometimes opt to take on debt as the easier path forward. \u201cThe best-case scenario is that parents take out a no-interest loan, but too often it\u2019s a buy now, pay later purchase or a payday loan.\u201d But part of the problem, Giblin said, was that financial hardship support had not kept pace with the rising costs of sending a child to school. According to a report by Futurity Investment Group, the cost of putting a child through a government school could reach $87,528 up to year 12. The cost was highest in Melbourne, where it could reach $102,807. Last week NAB reported an increasing number of Australians were expected to seek its no interest loans, offered in partnership with the charity Good Shepherd, as a result of the rising cost of living. This cost burden has also extended to school fees for some which are voluntary at government schools. One mother told Guardian Australia she felt pressured last year by her school to pay fees for her two children. She used her credit card and said she was still paying it off. \u201cThe school sent emails repeatedly saying only a small portion of parents have not paid. Then they send home the invoice with the kids, then the teachers also remind you to pay, and the teachers tell the kids to tell you,\u201d she said. According to a recent Consumer Policy Research Centre survey of Victorians, parents with buy now, pay later debt reported missing payments or asking for payment assistance at double the rate of those without children. Victoria\u2019s minister for education, Natalie Hutchins, said the policy on parent payments was \u201cvery clear\u201d. \u201cEach contribution must be voluntary. No parent or carer should be pressured in any way to make voluntary parent contributions.\u201d She also added that the state had programs to make sending children to school cheaper, particularly in recognition of rising cost-of-living pressures. This included discounted uniforms or glasses, subsidised school excursions, tutors in classrooms, and free breakfasts."

                    "body": "Hearts had more cause than would be customary to revel in Scottish Cup semi-final success over their city rivals, Hibs. The securing of a place in the Europa League playoff round means guaranteed European group stage football, if perhaps in the Conference League, next season. With that comes a financial boost loosely estimated at \u00a35m and widely categorised as a game changer. The mistake, however, would be in assuming Hearts have any interest in parading balance sheets. Saturday\u2019s meeting with Rangers provides opportunity to win the Scottish Cup for only the ninth time in a club history hurtling towards 150 years.  \u201cI want to make sure we are at least third in the league before trying to eat into the gap [to the top two] but I don\u2019t want us to be a club that \u2018wins\u2019 third place every year,\u201d says Andrew McKinlay, the Hearts chief executive. \u201cI am trying not to let myself think what it will be like if we win this cup. You could only appreciate the size of it if it happens. It means so much to Hearts; look at how the teams who won cups previously here are revered. It doesn\u2019t matter whether these are the best teams Hearts have ever had or not. Whoever plays on Saturday, if they win that cup they will for ever be club legends.\u201d If Celtic can be delighted with the reclaiming of the title and Rangers with a run to the Europa League final, there should be pride at Tynecastle over this campaign. Having returned to the top division \u2013 and amid grumbling from their supporter base at performances \u2013 Robbie Neilson\u2019s team coasted into third place. High praise is due to Neilson, the sporting director Joe Savage, chair Ann Budge and McKinlay. Hearts kept cool heads when their head coach was under extreme pressure, largely because of a Scottish Cup exit at the hands of the Highland League\u2019s Brora Rangers in March last year. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t really matter whether you think that was over the top; it was what it was,\u201d McKinlay says. \u201cIt helps that Robbie understands the expectations of the fans. It probably gave me a better understanding of the expectations of the Hearts support. I know when Robbie speaks to new players that he tells them about an expectation to win every game, especially at Tynecastle.  \u201cI think of the interviews I had at the beginning of this season and there was a lot of negativity, a lot of: \u2018What if you start slowly?\u2019 I genuinely didn\u2019t think we would but you never really know until you start playing. It went the other way: we got really positive momentum. It was a great start to the season and we never looked back. \u201cThere\u2019s a chance \u2013 depending on injuries \u2013 of just one Brora participant starting this Saturday. None of us will ever suggest anything other than that result being utterly unacceptable.\u201d Yet that evening seemed to kickstart a rebuild and attitude shift that has served Hearts well. Hearts have legitimate aspirations of raising annual income levels to \u00a325m and more before long. The backdrop to that is unusual. The supporter-led Foundation of Hearts, the club\u2019s main shareholder, makes significant annual donations. So, too, and to the tune of millions, do benefactors including the philanthropist James Anderson. Other areas of the Scottish game also benefited from Anderson\u2019s extraordinary kindness during the pandemic.  \u201cThe only thing he has ever asked for is that he doesn\u2019t have to wear a tie in our boardroom,\u201d says McKinlay. \u201cHe wants to know what more he can do to help, not just financially. He wants us to be better. He really encourages us to stretch ourselves. Why does he do it? My perception is that he was very taken by Ann totally changing the culture of the club. Hearts were put back into the middle of the community and he liked that. I think he is the best thing to have happened to Scottish football since I don\u2019t know when. His generosity is incredible.\u201d It is unclear whether Anderson must don neckwear at Hampden Park. More certain is that Hearts would celebrate glory in an emotional manner that would register far more than European bounties."

                    "body": "The amateur club Westhoughton Lions could hardly be more different from the occasion Matty Peet will be faced with in Saturday\u2019s Challenge Cup final, but ask the Wigan Warriors coach about his unconventional route to the rugby league summit and he would almost certainly tell you both ends of his story are equally important.\nBarely six months after being unveiled as Wigan\u2019s new head coach, Peet is one win away from securing the Challenge Cup for rugby league\u2019s most famous club for a record-extending 20th occasion. While most head coaches fall into the role after a distinguished playing career, Peet\u2019s own time as a professional barely extended beyond a short stint as a reserves player with Leigh Centurions.\n\nHe called time on his playing career in his early 20s, instead heading to university before taking his first steps into coaching with Westhoughton\u2019s under-12s. Eventually securing a job helping coach Wigan\u2019s young players, Peet has subsequently taken on pretty much every coaching role at the club either side of a short stint in rugby union with Sale. He is far from your ordinary head coach, but he is a man the Warriors have earmarked for the top job for years.\n\u201cI remember I watched him do a training session once with the academy,\u201d Wigan\u2019s executive director, Kris Radlinski, says. \u201cHe just did things I had never seen before. After the session I went back and reported it to the chairman and said, \u2018There\u2019s something different in this lad\u2019. He is a thinker and he was doing things I\u2019d never seen.\u201d It was an appointment that caught many Wigan fans off-guard last year given his lack of experience, but not the Warriors.\nIn recent seasons Wigan have lacked any sort of attacking flair, or indeed success. Peet has set about changing those things and the impact has been immediate, with the Warriors now in Saturday\u2019s final against Huddersfield at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium. His unique style has caught the eye of his players, too. \u201cHe\u2019s a brilliant listener and communicator, and pretty much unlike any other coach I\u2019ve had before,\u201d Wigan\u2019s long-serving England international Liam Farrell says.\n\u201cHe\u2019s a deep thinker, he knows so much about the game and you can tell he\u2019s dedicated his life to coaching. But the big thing for me is he knows every inch of this club, every member of staff, and as such he understands what the supporters expect from their team. Being from the area and a supporter of the club too, he just gets Wigan, which is important I think for a club like this where the standards are so high.\u201d\n\nPeet, understanding that Wigan supporters had grown weary of a more methodical, structured style of play, also set about making his side more attractive to watch. He brought in the former Great Britain half-back Lee Briers from Warrington to lead the attack, while also transitioning Wigan\u2019s legendary captain, Sean O\u2019Loughlin, into a post-playing role in charge of the defensive side of the Warriors.\n\u201cI\u2019m sure Matty delivers his message to the staff privately but in our meetings, he lets Briersy and Lockers take the lead, which is pretty unique,\u201d Farrell says. \u201cI\u2019m sure he has a big input in what they say but he\u2019s calm and trusts people. When he got the job, Matty got the senior players in and asked us what we needed to change and improve and how we could be better. He listened to us, and he\u2019s made sure our opinions were valued.\n\n\u201cTaking the job was a big learning curve for him and some people might have thought it was too early, but he\u2019s done a good job of proving everyone wrong so far.\u201d\nThe Wigan fullback Jai Field, perhaps Super League\u2019s standout player in 2022, has credited Peet\u2019s approach and style as a major reason in why he has been so good this year and it seems everywhere you turn, Peet\u2019s measured yet unique approach to coaching is earning him admirers.\n\u201cHe\u2019s very different in his approach,\u201d the Wigan prop Kaide Ellis says. \u201cHe\u2019s very psychological with his players but he\u2019s got a good balance. He doesn\u2019t get too technical, he\u2019s more on mindset and big on culture.\u201d Every fortnight, Wigan\u2019s players hold \u201cculture sessions\u201d, discussing life away from rugby. Peet is also keen for his players to be hands-on in the community, tightening the link between the club and the supporters.\n\nIt is certainly a different way to coach. But just months into a reign some felt would never amount to any success, Peet is one win away from his first trophy as a head coach. He said this year he would not consider himself a genuine Wigan coach until he delivered a trophy. You can be sure they will be watching in Westhoughton, where it all started nearly 20 years ago, to see if that vision becomes a reality."

Pakistan wants the Taliban to do more to crack down on extremist groups and worries they will spread violence into Pakistan. That has begun to happen already.\nKhan had been less critical of the Taliban over human rights than most foreign leaders.\nChina\nKhan consistently emphasised China\u2019s positive role in Pakistan and in the world at large.\nThe $60bn (\u00a346bn) China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, which binds the neighbours together, was conceptualised and launched under Pakistan\u2019s two established political parties, both of which are likely to share power in the new government.\nPotential successor Sharif, the younger brother of three-time former prime minister Nawaz Sharif, struck deals with China directly as chief minister of the eastern province of Punjab, and his reputation for getting major infrastructure projects off the ground while avoiding political grandstanding could in fact be music to Beijing\u2019s ears.\n\nIndia\nThe nuclear-armed neighbours have fought three wars since independence in 1947, two of them over the disputed Muslim-majority territory of Kashmir.\nTensions along the de facto border in Kashmir are at their lowest level since 2021, thanks to a ceasefire. But there have been no formal diplomatic talks for years because of deep distrust over a range of issues, including Khan\u2019s extreme criticism of India\u2019s prime minister, Narendra Modi, over his handling of attacks on minority Muslims in India.\nKaran Thapar, an Indian political commentator who has closely followed India-Pakistan relations, said the Pakistani military could put pressure on the new government in Islamabad to build on the successful ceasefire in Kashmir.\nPakistan\u2019s powerful army chief Gen Qamar Javed Bajwa said recently that his country was ready to move forward on Kashmir if India agrees.\nThe Sharif dynasty has been at the forefront of several dovish overtures towards India over the years.\nUS\nUS-based south Asia experts have said Pakistan\u2019s political crisis is unlikely to be a priority for President Joe Biden, who is grappling with the war in Ukraine, unless it leads to mass unrest or rising tensions with India.\n\u201cWe have so many other fish to fry,\u201d said Robin Raphel, a former assistant secretary of state for south Asia who is a senior associate with the Center for Strategic and International Studies thinktank.\nWith the Pakistani military maintaining its behind-the-scenes control of foreign and security policies, the change of government was not a major concern, according to some analysts.\n\u201cSince it\u2019s the military that calls the shots on the policies that the US really cares about, ie Afghanistan, India and nuclear weapons, internal Pakistani political developments are largely irrelevant for the US,\u201d said Curtis, who served as then-US President Donald Trump\u2019s national security council senior director for south Asia.\nShe added that Khan\u2019s visit to Moscow had been a \u201cdisaster\u201d in terms of US relations, and that a new government in Islamabad could at least help mend ties.\nKhan has blamed the US for the current political crisis, saying that Washington wanted him removed because of the recent Moscow trip. Washington denies any role."

                    "body": " Ukraine has rejected a Russian demand for Mariupol to surrender by 5am Moscow time (2am GMT / 10pm ET) on Monday. Ukraine\u2019s deputy prime minister Iryna Vereshchuk said there could be \u201cno talk of any surrenders\u201d and that Russia had been informed of the response. Russian Col Gen Mikhail Mizintsev had told the defenders of the city to \u201cLay down your arms\u201d. In a briefing on Sunday, he added that if the people of Mariupol surrendered, humanitarian corridors would then be opened in both the eastern and western directions from 10am Moscow time on Monday. US president Joe Biden will travel to Poland this week to discuss international efforts to support Ukraine and \u201cimpose severe and unprecedented costs on Russia\u201d for its invasion, the White House has said. The discussions will follow Biden\u2019s meetings in Brussels with Nato allies, G7 leaders, and EU leaders. Biden will host a call on Monday at 3pmGMT (11am ET) with president Emmanuel Macron of France, german chancellor Olaf Scholz, Italian prime minister Mario Draghi of Italy, and British prime minister Boris Johnson. Ukraine\u2019s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said that he believes a failure to negotiate the end of Russia\u2019s invasion will mean \u201ca third world war\u201d. He told CNN that he is \u201cready for negotiations\u201d with Russian president Vladimir Putin and that \u201cwe have to use any format, any chance in order to have a possibility of negotiating\u201d. Zelenskiy earlier called Putin\u2019s strategy a \u201cfinal solution\u201d for Ukraine. In an uncompromising address to the Israeli parliament, Ukraine\u2019s president challenged Israel over its failure to impose sanctions on Russia. At least four people have been killed following shelling of homes and a shopping district in Kyiv, according to Reuters, citing the state emergency service. Video showed firefighters rushing to rescue people trapped in the rubble of the Retroville shopping centre in Podilskiy. Ukraine\u2019s human rights spokesperson, Lyudmyla Denisova, said Russian troops had \u201ckidnapped\u201d residents and taken them to Russia. \u201cSeveral thousand Mariupol residents have been deported to Russia,\u201d she said on Telegram. After processing at \u201cfiltration camps\u201d, some had been transported to the Russian city of Taganrog, about 60 miles (100km) from Mariupol, and from there sent by rail \u201cto various economically depressed cities in Russia\u201d, she said. Mariupol\u2019s city council said Russia bombed an art school where 400 civilians including children were sheltering. Petro Andrushenko, an adviser to the city\u2019s mayor, said there was no exact number of casualties. \u201cThe city continues to be shelled both from the sky and the sea,\u201d Andrushenko said on Telegram. Ten million people \u2013 more than a quarter of the population \u2013 have now fled their homes in Ukraine due to Russia\u2019s \u201cdevastating\u201d war, the head of the UN refugee agency, UNHCR, said on Sunday. And at least 902 civilians have been killed and 1,459 injured in Ukraine as of midnight local time on Saturday, the UN human rights office said. The Ukrainian parliament says 115 Ukrainian children have been killed and at least 140 more have been injured. China\u2019s ambassador to the US has said his country is not sending weapons to Russia for use in Ukraine. He said China was sending food, sleeping bags and other aid, \u201cnot weapons and ammunition to any party\u201d. But pressed on US television on Sunday, he did not definitively rule out the possibility Beijing might do so in the future. Germany has agreed a contract with Qatar for the supply of liquefied natural gas (LNG) that will help the European country wean itself off its dependency on Russian energy. It could take several years for the deal to come into full effect because Germany has no terminals for selivery of LNG. Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia said it was increasing oil production to meet global demand. Turkey\u2019s foreign minister, Mevl\u00fct \u00c7avu\u015fo\u011flu, has claimed a peace deal between Russia and Ukraine is \u201cclose\u201d, despite the scepticism of western governments. But the US ambassador to the United Nations warned on Sunday there was little immediate hope of a negotiated end to the war. Eleven Ukrainian political parties have been suspended because of their links with Russia, according to Zelenskiy. The country\u2019s national security and defence council took the decision to ban the parties from any political activity. Most of the parties affected were small, but one of them, the Opposition Platform for Life, has 44 seats in the 450-seat Ukrainian parliament. "

Bye!\n\n\n\n\n 2.32pm  \n\nEmma Hayes\u2019 post-match thoughts\n\u201cWe were horrific in the first 20 minutes, we didn\u2019t get our legs going. But once we executed our gameplan we stifled them and they struggled. The goal came at the right time, and by the end I thought we completely dominated.\n\u201cYou never know what you\u2019re going to get after international breaks, and at the start it was like we had lead in our legs. Defensively we were solid and that\u2019s our foundation; that\u2019s what keeps us in competitions. \n\u201cThis result doesn\u2019t have any impact on the title race. We\u2019re in the final, that\u2019s all it means. I don\u2019t care who we play \u2013 we\u2019re there, that\u2019s the main thing. Two world-class teams.\u201d\n\n\n\n 2.29pm  \n\nHere\u2019s the second goal from Ji\n\n\n\n\n 2.28pm  \n\nThe player of the match is Aniek Nouwen\n\u201cThe second half was amazing. We struggled a bit in the first half but the manager told us to keep going and to fight for everything. It was nice to play against Viv \u2013 we had to fight but I enjoy games like that. Give me more of them!\u201d\n\n\n\n 2.21pm  \nFull time: Arsenal 0-2 Chelsea\n\nPeep peep! The holders Chelsea will play Manchester City in the FA Cup final after a dominant second-half performance at Meadow Park. The first 45 minutes were uneventful, but Chelsea took control after the break and won through superb goals from Guro Reiten and Ji So-yun. By the end, Arsenal were well beaten.\n\n\n\n 2.18pm  \n\n90+1 min Three minutes of added time.\n\n\n\n 2.18pm  \n\n89 min Mead\u2019s driven cross from the left is headed wide from a tight angle by Parris. That was a decent chance to give Arsenal a bit of hope.\n\nUpdated at 2.18pm BST\n\n\n 2.16pm  \n\n88 min England has another shot blocked, and then McCabe takes out Reiten in her followthrough after clearing the ball. Arsenal have been well beaten.\n\n\n\n 2.16pm  \n\n87 min Nouwen\u2019s up and under is controlled beautifully by England, just outside the area, and then she cuts across a fine shot that just clears the crossbar. Zinsberger was beaten. \n\n\n\n 2.12pm  \n\n84 min England is fouled by Catley on the right wing. Reiten curls the free-kick in, Parris heads it away.\n\n\n\n 2.09pm  \n\n81 min Miedema has a shot blocked by Nouwen. Arsenal are running out of time.\n\n\n\n 2.07pm  \n\n79 min Another change for Chelsea. The excellent Ji, who scored the second goal, is replaced by Jessie Fleming.\n\n\n\n 2.04pm  \n\n75 min Arsenal can\u2019t generate any attacking momentum. Chelsea have done a number on them in the second half.\n\n\n\n 2.00pm  \n\n72 min Chelsea also make a change: Pernille Harder on, Sam Kerr off.\n\n\n\n 1.59pm  \n\n71 min A double change for Arsenal: Nikita Parris and Tobin Heath come on for Stina Blackstenius and Caitlin Foord.\n\n\n\n 1.58pm  \n\n69 min Arsenal are all over the show. Wubben-Moy tries to dribble out of her own area and is robbed by England. She diverts the ball to Ingle, whose snapshot is pushed away dramatically by the diving Zinsberger, and Ji puts the rebound just wide.\n\n\n\n 1.55pm  \n\n67 min The resulting corner is headed well wide by the under-pressure Kerr. Chelsea have been much the better side since half-time.\n\n\n\n 1.54pm  \n\n66 min Chelsea almost make it 3-0 on the break. Ji plays a good pass into Reiten on the edge of the D; she turns and curls a decent shot that is pushed round the post by the diving Zinsberger.\n\n\n\n 1.53pm  \n\n65 min Cuthbert is booked for a foul on Foord.\n\n\n\n 1.51pm  \n\n64 min A change for Arsenal: Frida Maanum replaces Lia Walti in midfield.\n\n\n\n 1.50pm  \n\nArsenal got in a bit of a mess defensively, with Wubben-Moy\u2019s panicky clearance ricocheting off Kerr. Ji collected the ball on the edge of the area, moved it away from Walti and then spanked it in off the underside of the bar.\n\nUpdated at 1.51pm BST\n\n\n 1.49pm  \nGOAL! Arsenal 0-2 Chelsea (Ji 61)\n\nJi makes it two with another cracking strike!\n\n\n\nUpdated at 2.07pm BST\n\n\n 1.46pm  \n\n58 min: Fine save from Zinsberger! Chelsea are looking dangerous now. A long throw from the left bounced favourably for England, who held off Wubben-Moy and drove a low shot from 12 yards that was pushed round the near post by the diving Zinsberger. That\u2019s a really smart save.\n\n\n\n 1.45pm  \n\n57 min Here\u2019s Reiten\u2019s goal, floated beautifully over Zinsberger.\n\n\n\n\n 1.42pm  \n\n54 min Cuthbert shoots wide from long range.\n\n\n\n 1.41pm  \n\n53 min That was such a good finish, though Arsenal will be unhappy with their defending. Nobody went out to Reiten, who had time to pick her spot in the far corner.\n\nUpdated at 1.42pm BST\n\n\n 1.40pm  \n\nReiten received the ball 30 yards from goal, realised nobody was coming to challenge her and pushed the ball forward to the edge of the D. Then she opened her body to float a lovely curling shot that beat the leaping Zinsberger and nestled in the far corner.\n\nUpdated at 1.40pm BST\n\n\n 1.38pm  \nGOAL! Arsenal 0-1 Chelsea (Reiten 50)\n\nGuro Reiten gives Chelsea the lead with a majestic goal! \n\n\nUpdated at 2.25pm BST\n\n\n 1.38pm  \n\n49 min: Just wide from Mead! That was so close to the opening goal. Catley\u2019s flat cross from the left was controlled beautifully by Mead, who turned Nouwen elegantly and drove the ball just wide from eight yards. Having done the hard bit with the control and turn, she probably should hve scored.\n\n\n\n 1.35pm  \n\n47 min Mead is booked for a high challenge on Carter. \n\n\n\n 1.33pm  \n\n46 mim Peep peep! Arsenal begin the second half, with no changes on either side.\n\n\n\n 1.17pm  \nHalf time: Arsenal 0-0 Chelsea\n\nLet us never speak of that first half again. It was tense, cautious and surprisingly low in quality. But I swear, by the moon and the stars in the sky, that the second half will be better.\n\n\n\n 1.16pm  \n\n45 min A poor ball from Williamson is intercepted by England. She feeds it into Kerr, whose heavy touch allows Williamson to clear. That was a chance. Moments later, Ji\u2019s dangerous cross is headed behind for a corner by Wubben-Moy.\n\n\n\n 1.11pm  \n\n41 min McCabe\u2019s long throw bounces off Mead (I think) and behind for a goalkick. This isn\u2019t great, even if the tension is understandable.\n\n\n\n 1.08pm  \n\n38 min Reiten\u2019s hanging cross is only partially cleared by Catley at the far post. Charles picks up the ball and drags a left-footed shot from 15 yards that is comfortably saved to her left by Zinsberger. \n\n\n\n 1.06pm  \n\n36 min Ingle\u2019s booming long-range shot is headed away by Williamson.\n\n\n\n 1.04pm  \n\n34 min The cautious nature of the game reflects the respect these sides have for each other. There have been few clear chances, just one for Blackstenius in fact.\n\n\nUpdated at 1.33pm BST\n\n\n 1.00pm  \n\n30 min Ji is penalised for holding Walti, who had just given the ball away to Kerr on the edge of the area. It probably was a foul, and there were no complaints from Ji.\n\n\n\n 12.56pm  \n\n27 min Here\u2019s that effort from Miedema in the 20th minute.\n\n\n\n\n 12.55pm  \n\n25 min After good pressing from Cuthbert, England\u2019s long-range shot is comfortably saved by Zinsberger.\n\n\nUpdated at 12.55pm BST\n\n\n 12.53pm  \n\n24 min It\u2019s still very cagey. The first goal is always important, but today it feels especially so.\n\n\n\n 12.50pm  \n\n20 min Out of nothing, Miedema charges to within 20 yards of goal and whistles a rising drive just over the bar. That was a lovely effort.\n\n\n\n 12.49pm  \n\n19 min It\u2019s all a bit cagey. Arsenal have been the better team, though there isn\u2019t a huge amount in it.\n\n\n\n 12.47pm  \n\n17 min Reiten\u2019s angled through ball is just too heavy for Kerr, who tries to control it with her head but can only put it behind for a goalkick.\n\n\n\n 12.46pm  \n\n16 min A better attack from Chelsea. Ji runs at a backpedalling defence and finds Reiten in space on the left side of the area. Her floated cross is headed away at the near post by Williamson.\n\n\n\n 12.43pm  \n\n13 min Blackstenius skins Nouwen on the left side of the box but then makes a mess of a relatively straightforward cutback to Miedema. That was an excellent opportunity for Arsenal. \n\nUpdated at 12.44pm BST\n\n\n 12.42pm  \n\n12 min McCabe and Mead combine nicely to release Mead, whose low cross is blocked by Charles.\n\n\nUpdated at 12.50pm BST\n\n\n 12.40pm  \n\n10 min Chelsea haven\u2019t really got going yet. The last few minutes have been fairly scrappy.\n\n\n\n 12.36pm  \n\n6 min England is fine. Beth England, that is.\n\n\n\n 12.34pm  \n\n4 min Williamson\u2019s shot smacks England straight in the face, and there\u2019s a break in play while she receives treatment.\n\n\nUpdated at 12.44pm BST\n\n\n 12.34pm  \n\n3 min It\u2019s been a really good start from Arsenal. Mead runs onto a long ball, slithers away from Carter in the area and is about to shoot when Bright pokes the ball behind for a corner. Actually Carter did well too, getting a slight touch on the ball just before Bright\u2019s clearance.\n\nUpdated at 12.34pm BST\n\n\n 12.32pm  \n\n3 min \u201cIt\u2019s hardly their fault,\u201d says Charles Antaki, \u201cbut it falls to the Arsenal women to salvage some pride for the club \u2013 though to be sure they\u2019ve had one or two shockers themselves this season, not excluding losing 2-0 to a club which is on the point of being relegated.

(That game, the 2020-21 final, was delayed because of Covid.) One of these teams will be back at Wembley next month to face Manchester City in an equally mouthwatering final.\nChelsea are slight favourites, despite being away from home, but really it\u2019s too close to call.

I am not sure if I will be jailed or killed for this, but I am saying it as it is.\u201d Denisov, who also scored in Zenit St Petersburg\u2019s 2008 Uefa Cup final victory over Rangers, added that he had written to the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, asking him to stop the war. The Russian parliament recently passed legislation imposing jail terms of up to 15 years for anyone spreading \u201cfake news\u201d or carrying out any public action that would discredit the military action. Tennis player Andrey Rublev wrote \u201cno war please\u201d on a camera lens at the end of a match in Dubai shortly after the invasion of Ukraine began in February.

However, he should recover to face Real Madrid in Paris on 28 May.\nKlopp said: \u201cThere\u2019s a good chance that he will be available for the Champions League final.\u201d\nAlthough Fabinho\u2019s absence is undoubtedly a setback to Liverpool\u2019s FA Cup and title prospects, their manager believes his squad will handle the loss.\nKlopp, who replaced Fabinho with Jordan Henderson to good effect against Villa, said: \u201cWe have to cope, because we can cope. Having him or not having him is a difference but it is all fine. That\u2019s normal stuff that happens. It\u2019s never in a position where you have 12 options, it\u2019s always in a position where you don\u2019t. We have a few players. Hendo came on and played incredible. He has played super games this season at 6 so that is not a problem.\u201d\n\nChelsea are hopeful that Mateo Kovacic will give them a boost by proving his fitness in time to face Liverpool. Kovacic limped off during the first half of Chelsea\u2019s 3-0 victory over Leeds on Wednesday after suffering an ankle injury in the challenge that saw Daniel James receive a red card. Thomas Tuchel cut a frustrated figure when he said after the match that the influential midfielder had little chance of a swift recovery.\nHowever, there is a chance that Tuchel\u2019s reaction was overly pessimistic. Kovacic, who heavily iced his ankle and leg on the bench at Leeds, has not sustained a long-term injury and could be involved against Liverpool if he is able to train on Friday.\nChelsea will be desperate for Kovacic to make himself available. The Croatia international has had an excellent season and Tuchel has other concerns in central midfield. N\u2019Golo Kant\u00e9 is a doubt after missing Chelsea\u2019s past three games and Jorginho has been playing with a minor knock."

                    "body": "I\u2019ll never forget my first game at White Hart Lane. As I walked to the stadium, my hand in my father\u2019s, I could feel the crowd swelling around me, the language as colourful as the sea of flags swimming in the air. This was a world detached from everyday reality. The environment was electric. Adrenaline coursed through my veins. I was terrified and exhilarated at the same time. When I reached the stands, I saw my heroes for the first time in the flesh. As a young boy, watching Tottenham play was a chance to see myself in something that I could never find in TV or books. Garth Crooks, a young black English centre-forward, played alongside Argentinian players Ossie Ardiles and Ricardo Villa. My parents came to the UK from Guyana, a black-majority country on the South American coast; this was representation like nothing I\u2019d experienced before. Crooks was an idol for young supporters like me. He was the forward in a Spurs team that won back-to-back FA Cups and a European trophy. But behind the glory, Crooks experienced such rampant abuse that he couldn\u2019t talk about it. For so many black people like me who worshipped the game, football has always been a world of paradoxes. A New Formation explores these paradoxes and complexities in the stories of black footballers in Britain. A mixture of interviews and analysis by authors such as Musa Okwonga and sports broadcaster Jeanette Kwakye MBE, collated by editor and writer Calum Jacobs, it delves deep into the lives of these individuals as well as the trials and tribulations of what it means to be black in the beautiful game. It does not aim to explain these lives solely through the lens of racism, but instead tells multifaceted stories of individuals who lived lives of both triumph and torment. It is not a story of despair. It is a story of struggle.  Take the life of Justin Fashanu, thoughtfully analysed by Okwonga in the second chapter. Fashanu became Britain\u2019s first \u00a31m black footballer when he signed for Nottingham Forest, who had won the European Cup the year previously. In 1990, he became the first, and only, professional English footballer to publicly come out. But the backlash that stuck wasn\u2019t the jokes from his fellow players. It was the way that the tabloids dragged the story through the dirt. Tony Sewell, who would go on to release a report denying the existence of institutional racism in the UK, wrote in response to Fashanu coming out: \u201cWe heteros are sick and tired of tortured queens playing hide and seek around their closets. Homosexuals are the greatest queer-bashers around. No other group of people are so preoccupied with making their own sexuality look dirty.\u201d Fashanu\u2019s life ended tragically in suicide and there has still not been a black professional footballer who has come out since. Although elements of overt racism still occur, some of the abuse that fans and players experienced in the era of the dark old days has gradually faded thanks to several factors, including the modernisation of stadiums and the exceptional work of activists, former footballers and pressure groups such as Show Racism the Red Card. But as Jacobs rightly identifies: \u201cThis fixation on the obviously racist hooligan obscured the more nuanced and complex forms of racist expression that permeated British football.\u201d It is the manifestation of subtle forms of abuse, through the words of the media and often those involved in the game, that seeps into the population and social media.  This is well reflected in the final chapter, which focuses on the life of Raheem Sterling and is written by Jacobs himself. Sterling was born in Jamaica but moved to Neasden, in London, at the age of five. The winger broke into the Liverpool first XI quickly, becoming a regular starter and England international at the age of just 17. But in these early years of his career, the tabloids constantly criticised Sterling\u2019s personal life, becoming overtly racist when the Sun ran the infamous headline \u201cPrem rat of the Caribbean\u201d on its front page. Acutely aware of the backlash many face when speaking out, Sterling\u2019s decision to push back against those who had sought to bring him down by shining a spotlight on the abuse that he and other black players have experienced showed true bravery. Unafraid to combine the pride of his ancestral history with his reputation in British society, Sterling has immeasurably changed the lives of those inspired by his courage by bending the arc of history in the right direction. Sterling\u2019s story reflects a theme that runs throughout this powerful book. Black players have their lives picked apart in ways that simply do not exist for their white counterparts. Demba Ba, for instance, whose award-winning performances and exceptional goal-scoring record at Newcastle earned him a move to Chelsea, was described as \u201csluggish\u201d by his own manager due to fasting during the month of Ramadan. Whether they like it or not, black players have scrutiny thrust upon them. The experiences of black footballers are nuanced and varied. By ignoring the rich complexity of black British society, our institutions and leaders constantly cast black people as a monolith; the policies of our government and the words in our newspapers reflect this. A New Formation powerfully pushes back against this narrative by exploring the lives of black women, black Muslims and the black LGBTQ+ community, all within the context of football. There are many factors that bind these groups together but also important stories that need to be heard and understood individually and on a personal level. Each tale brings with it a sense of optimism that things will be better for the successors of these players. Anita Asante, a Champions League-winning defender at Arsenal, describes her hope that \u201cthe younger generation now feel more empowered\u201d and that they have the self-confidence to achieve their goals by merit. However, change does not come about through hope alone. There is a common understanding among these players that they are blazing a trail, but with this leadership comes responsibility. Many have no choice but to be a role model; by being successful and black, you have already become one. In my lifetime, I have seen the success of black footballers from Archway-born Real Madrid forward Laurie Cunningham to GB star and pundit Alex Scott. Times have changed. New heroes have been born. A New Formation tells the stories of these legends in their own words on their own terms. This is cultural expression, social history and black pride at its finest. \u2022 David Lammy is the MP for Tottenham and author of Tribes \u2022 A New Formation: How Black Footballers Shaped the Modern Game, edited by Calum Jacobs, is published by Cornerstone (\u00a316.99).

With the deadline for the deal to be completed less than a fortnight away Whitehall insiders have said there are fears of Chelsea going out of business. The government is determined that none of the proceeds from the club being sold to Todd Boehly\u2019s consortium go to Abramovich, who put the European champions up for sale when he was hit with sanctions after Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine.  Chelsea, whose special operating licence expires on 31 May, require government approval before the deal goes through. But talks over what will happen to Abramovich\u2019s \u00a31.6bn loan to the club have stalled, heightening concerns over the deadline for the sale being missed. The government\u2019s proposal is for a two-stage process in which the \u00a32.5bn from the sale to Boehly\u2019s group would go into an escrow account, where it would be held until it is satisfied the funds will go to a charity for victims of the war in Ukraine. But Westminster sources have said the deal has been held up by the club\u2019s ownership structure. Chelsea\u2019s parent company, Fordstam Ltd, owes \u00a31.6bn to Camberley International Investments, a Jersey-based company with suspected links to Abramovich. The government has claimed that Abramovich and Chelsea want the loan repaid and then frozen before it goes to a charitable foundation. The government is insistent that would break the terms of the sanctions imposed on Abramovich. Whitehall insiders also say they are yet to see legal assurances that the money will not eventually end up going to the Russian oligarch and need guarantees the funds will reach good causes. Chelsea and a spokesperson for Abramovich have been approached for comment.  Abramovich\u2019s camp have previously denied claims that the billionaire could hold up the deal by reneging on his promise to write off his loan to Chelsea. Abramovich has insisted the charitable foundation will be an independent organisation and will be run by the former head of a United Nations organisation with no previous connection to him. Chelsea have been represented in talks with the government by the club\u2019s chairman, Bruce Buck, and the powerful director Marina Granovskaia. Buck and Granovskaia, both of whom have long-term ties to Abramovich, are expected to be retained by Boehly\u2019s group."

If so, his first crop of two-year-olds would have been stepping on to the track this spring.\nInstead, the grand old horse himself is still going strong and about to start his seventh season on the racecourse in Friday\u2019s Yorkshire Cup.\n\nCavalryman, in 2014, is the only eight-year-old \u201centire\u201d horse to win at Group Two level in Britain in the last 20 years, and John Gosden, Stradivarius\u2019s trainer, said this week that he is \u201ccertainly not giving him hard, hard works at home, he\u2019s too old for that\u201d.\nGosden added: \u201cI don\u2019t want everyone there thinking he\u2019s going to necessarily go and win another Yorkshire Cup, I\u2019d just like to see him run a race that acts as a platform going forward.\u201d\nOn that basis, Stradivarius looks too short for Friday\u2019s race at 4-5 and Dermot Weld\u2019s gritty mare Search For A Song (3.35) is the obvious one to bet against him at around 5-1. The six-year-old has Group One-winning form in the 2020 Irish St Leger, has the benefit of a run behind her already this year and gets a handy 6lb from the favourite.\nYork 1.50: An astonishing 13 of these juveniles \u2013 in a 16-strong field \u2013 were winners last time out so the biggest improver is likely to land the spoils. Fix You is a tentative pick having put up a fair performance on the clock when going clear on debut at Thirsk last month.\nNewbury 2.05: Puerto De Vega was much improved on the all-weather over the winter and will go close if transferring that form back to the turf.\nYork 2.25: John Gosden\u2019s Grande Dame won despite very obvious greenness at Ascot last month and should take this step up in class in her stride.\nYork 3.00: A couple of fancied runners have a stamina question to answer so Belloccio could be a fair bet at around 6-1 to follow up a career-best at Kempton last month.\nYork 4.10: A strong hand here for Charlie Appleby, with Yibir\u2019s brother Wild Crusade a marginal pick over the unbeaten New Comedy after his ready win on handicap debut at Kempton last month.\nDesert Crown is new Derby favourite after storming Dante Stakes win\nThirty-six years after his first success in the Dante Stakes with Shahrastani, Sir Michael Stoute was back on track in more ways than one at York on Thursday as Desert Crown, a big gamble for the Derby in recent weeks, quickened clear of seven opponents in Britain\u2019s last major trial and took over as the new favourite for the Classic on 4 June.\nStoute was Britain\u2019s champion trainer 10 times between 1981 and 2009 and has five Derby winner\u2019s trophies on his mantlepiece at Freemason Lodge, the most recent from Workforce\u2019s Epsom victory in 2010 after he had finished second in the Dante.\n\nHis once pre-eminent stable has not had so much as a runner in the Derby since 2016, however, and only two starters in the premier Classic since Carlton House, the favourite, narrowly missed out behind Pour Moi in 2011.\nStoute\u2019s appearances on the racecourse have also become increasingly rare in recent months but he was on the Knavesmire to see Desert Crown cut through the field from two furlongs out and then extend his lead over Royal Patronage to three-and-a-quarter lengths at the line, despite drifting right in the closing stages.\nDesert Crown is open to any amount of improvement after what was only the second start of his career, and this victory was enough to see him end Stone Age\u2019s four-day reign as Derby favourite after his wide-margin win at Leopardstown on Sunday.\nStoute\u2019s colt is now top-priced at 9-4 (from 7-1) for Epsom with Stone Age out to 100-30. Changingoftheguard, O\u2019Brien\u2019s Chester Vase winner, at 9-1 is the only other runner at single-figure odds.\n\u201cIt\u2019s only his second race, he\u2019s travelled well and he\u2019s accelerated pleasingly,\u201d Stoute said afterwards. \u201cYou have to be very happy with that performance.\n\u201cI thought it was a strong Dante, but I wasn\u2019t confident because I felt we\u2019d only just got him up to a race having had a minor setback late February. We didn\u2019t rush him, we took our time and he was only just ready to run now.\u201d\nRichard Kingscote, Desert Crown\u2019s jockey, has had just one previous ride in the Derby, finishing 11th of 12 on the 14-1 shot Knight To Behold in 2018, but can now look forward to riding the favourite in three weeks\u2019 time.\nKingscote is effectively No.2 behind Ryan Moore at the Stoute stable, but Moore\u2019s first commitment to ride for Aidan O\u2019Brien \u2013 who had the third-home Bluegrass on Thursday \u2013 is likely to see him riding Stone Age at Epsom.\n\n\u201cOf course, Ryan\u2019s horse in Ireland [Stone Age] was very impressive and going to a Derby is always going to be difficult,\u201d Kingscote said. \u201cHe\u2019s done well from two to three, I was taken with how well he\u2019s filled out and they\u2019ve done a great job with him.\n\u201cI\u2019m in a very privileged position to be able to work under Sir Michael and Ryan, I\u2019ve been lucky Ryan had one in the race today and people were nice enough to let me on. Fortunately I delivered on that.\u201d"

                    "body": "Cale Makar barely broke a smile after scoring his second goal and Colorado\u2019s seventh of the night. He fist-bumped Mikko Rantanen to thank him for the pass and skated to the bench. He and the Avalanche are calm, confident and rolling. They\u2019re now two wins from dethroning the two-time defending champions. Looking like by far the better team, the Avalanche overwhelmed the Tampa Bay Lightning 7-0 in Game 2 of the Stanley Cup final on Saturday night to take a 2-0 lead in the best-of-seven series. Coach Jared Bednar called it \u201cas close to perfect of a game as you can get from your players.\u201d \u201cI feel like we played to our identity to a \u2018T\u2019 tonight,\u201d Makar said. \u201cWe had some good goals and stuff like that. ... It was a little bit of a weird one tonight. Obviously, we\u2019re getting opportunities but guys were able to able to capitalize, so that\u2019s good part.\u201d Valeri Nichushkin scored his seventh and eighth goals of the playoffs and continued to be the best player on the ice in the final, Game 1 overtime hero Andre Burakovsky beat Andrei Vasilevskiy again and even defensive defenseman Josh Manson and 35-year-old grinder Darren Helm got in on the fun with a goal apiece. Makar, who didn\u2019t even have a shot on goal in Game 1, scored twice in the third period, inciting chants of \u201cWe want the Cup!\u201d from a fired up crowd. \u201cThey\u2019re playing at an elite level right now give them credit. We are not,\u201d Lightning coach Jon Cooper said. \u201cThey\u2019re two good teams. They\u2019re just playing a much higher level right now than we are.\u201d Rarely have the Lightning been completely outclassed during this run of postseason success, but they also hadn\u2019t faced an opponent like the Avalanche, who forced them into one uncharacteristic mistake after another. Colorado was dominant in every facet of the game to move two victories away from its first title since 2001 and the first by this core led by Nathan MacKinnon. The Avalanche go to Tampa for Game 3 on Monday night up in the series despite no goals in the series from MacKinnon, who at times has played like a man possessed in an effort to finally break though and hoist the Cup. They still became just the third team in NHL history to score three-plus goals in the first period of Games 1 and 2 in the final. \u201cWe played a pretty good game,\u201d Helm said. \u201cWe just played a full 60-minute game.\u201d  The dominant performance started by pouncing on an early mistake by typically reliable Lightning defenseman Erik Cernak when he bobbled the puck at the blue line on one of the game\u2019s first shifts. It was all Avalanche after that. Their aggressive forecheck led them to draw a penalty on veteran Ryan McDonagh, score on the ensuing power play when Burakovsky fed Nichushkin for his first of the night. It wasn\u2019t his last, and Colorado poured it on with six of the game\u2019s first seven shots and complete territorial domination with much of the game played in the Tampa Bay end. With Vasilevskiy whose play was the key to the Lightning\u2019s incredible ability to bounce back after a loss in the playoffs looking shaky and even dropping his head after letting Makar beat him clean on one of many 2-on-1 rushes, the Avalanche made the most of all their offensive zone time. The highest-scoring team this postseason put on a clinic against the team that has played more hockey than anyone else over the past two years. That may finally be taking its toll, and it\u2019s exacerbated by the blazing speed with which the Avalanche play. They again not only outskated the Lightning but used quick feet to force errors that turned into goals. \u201cWe came out with a purpose,\u201d said forward Andew Cogliano, who returned after missing Game 1 with a right finger injury. \u201cWe got to our game, we skated from the drop of the puck and we just didn\u2019t let up.\u201d Tampa Bay fell to 18-2 after a loss since the start of the first round in 2020. The streak of 18 in a row ended in the Eastern Conference final against the New York Rangers when the Lightning fell behind 2-0 before roaring back, though it\u2019s hard to see Colorado falling into the same trap. The way the Lightning lost this one by far their biggest blowout loss during this run came as a surprise to just about everyone. \u201cAm I shocked that we lost 7-zip?\u201d Lightning captain Steven Stamkos said. \u201cI mean, I don\u2019t think we saw that coming.\u201d Even if players brush off the concept of momentum from game to game during a playoff series, their romp over the champs combined with a 7-0 road record should fill the Avalanche with confidence. But they might again need to dip into their pool of depth because of injuries. After getting Andrew Cogliano back from missing the season opener with a right finger injury, the Avalanche lost Burakovsky again in the second period. Burakovsky blocked a shot in the first game in the West final and has been playing through pain since. Bednar said he would be re-evaluated ahead of Game 2. Colorado is inflicting plenty of pain on Tampa Bay, which resorted to some rough stuff after falling behind. Of course, even MacKinnon was throwing hits in the third period despite the game being well in hand. Darcy Kuemper was barely tested in net for Colorado, picking up the shutout with 17 saves. \u201cHe was just rock solid,\u201d Manson said. \u201cHe was exactly what we needed to be.\u201d"

                    "body": "James Milner celebrated Liverpool\u2019s FA Cup victory by treating himself to a Coke on the coach from Wembley to the airport. \u201cFull fat, because Diet Coke is worse for you,\u201d he claimed. By 10.30 the next morning he was sitting through a video analysis meeting of Southampton. Chasing a quadruple is not all glamour.\nAfter the joy and the exertion of Wembley, where Liverpool and Chelsea players almost ran themselves to a stand-still in the second half of extra time, J\u00fcrgen Klopp\u2019s players must go again at St Mary\u2019s Stadium on Tuesday and win again to take the title race with Manchester City to the wire. Lifting trophies helps alleviate tiredness, although Milner wishes there was more time to savour each one.\n\n\u201cIt was probably harder if you go back six weeks but we\u2019ve got three games left now,\u201d says the 36-year-old, whose contribution to the cause remains invaluable. \u201cAll the stuff we\u2019ve been through, training, games, recovering, travelling, with three games left if you\u2019re on one leg it\u2019s worth going through.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve just won the FA Cup. Would you like to celebrate more? Yes, we would, but we can\u2019t afford to do that. That\u2019s the tough thing about being at this level, you maybe can\u2019t afford to enjoy your successes as much as you\u2019d like to. You win a trophy and it\u2019s like: \u2018When\u2019s the next game?\u2019 You win the Premier League and you can enjoy it for three weeks on your holiday, then it\u2019s pre-season and you have to go again. That\u2019s probably the one thing you regret in your career: that you don\u2019t enjoy it as much as you should. But that\u2019s part of being successful; you have to be focused and move on to the next one.\u201d\nThe title contenders will be without Mohamed Salah and Virgil van Dijk against Southampton, who will be playing their first game in 10 days, but this Liverpool squad have grown accustomed to finding a way.\n\nAs Milner says: \u201cThe group, the manager, the experience of being there before without big players. If you go back to Barcelona, that famous night, look at the players who were missing then. That shows a great mentality within the squad, it shows how well we train, how well we\u2019re coached.\n\u201cIf you miss those players for half a season it\u2019s going to be tough but everyone is ready to go even if they haven\u2019t played for a while. Look at last season, just to get into the Champions League, the players who were playing centre-half. We changed it round and we found a way, and that\u2019s got us to a Champions League final.\u201d\nMilner turned to face the Liverpool crowd at Wembley when Kostas Tsimikas stepped up to place the cup winning penalty past \u00c9douard Mendy and the name of another left-back into Anfield folklore.\n\u201cI wanted to watch our fans\u2019 reaction,\u201d the midfielder explains. \u201cI had faith in Kostas, I know he\u2019s got a wand of a left foot. Obviously you\u2019re nervous, because you know there\u2019s a good chance it could be over, but how many times do you get to play at Wembley and experience that?\n\n\u201cYou see everyone experiencing what you\u2019re feeling yourself: relief, joy, everything. It\u2019s a special group of players and a special group of people to share these things with in the dressing room after the game. I said to Trent [Alexander-Arnold]: \u2018Your cabinet is pretty full, but don\u2019t get bored of it.\u2019 What an incredible player he is, but he\u2019s lucky that he\u2019s come into a team that is so good. He deserves it because of how good a player he is but you never know when things are going to change, so you have to enjoy it while it\u2019s here.\u201d\nMilner is not bored of it. Saturday delivered the 10th major trophy of his career. He will be out of contract this summer but has been offered a 12-month extension, although wants to wait until this remarkable campaign is over before deciding his future. \u201cIt does get better,\u201d he said of the feeling of winning trophies. \u201cBecause you don\u2019t know how long is left, do you?\u201d"

                    "body": "Jim Chalmers has declared it is \u201cabsurd\u201d to think the Albanese government in 2023 will be a photocopy of the Hawke and Keating governments in the wake of a sustained backlash against his new essay championing values-based capitalism. The treasurer says the overwhelmingly negative reaction to his summer think piece, published by the Monthly last month, is out of step with sentiment in the investor community and also reveals a disconnect between some opinion leaders in Australia and cutting-edge economic policy analysis overseas. Chalmers used a speech to a Labor-aligned thinktank on Sunday to outline his policy agenda for the opening of the new parliamentary year, confirming he would release a tax expenditure statement later in the month, a review of the Reserve Bank of Australia in March, and an intergenerational report and a wellbeing framework later in the year.  With parliament to sit on Monday in the first session after the summer recess, Chalmers said he was pursuing \u201cimportant steps\u201d on sustainable finance, a \u201cnew focus\u201d for the Productivity Commission, work on regulating crypto and payments, while pursuing a housing accord with the housing minister, Julie Collins. He said high inflation would be the government\u2019s main economic focus, and his priorities in the May budget would be providing cost-of-living relief, growing the economy in a more inclusive and more sustainable way, and repairing the budget to enable more generous social policy spending, including on Medicare and aged care.  Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup  Chalmers also addressed the sustained controversy around the summer essay. The treasurer signalled in the 6,000-word piece he wanted to expand the opportunity for \u201cimpact investing\u201d while pressing ahead with regulatory reforms, including a \u201cnew taxonomy\u201d to help investors \u201calign their choices\u201d with the government\u2019s more ambitious emissions reduction targets. On Sunday, Chalmers characterised the backlash on the opinion pages of national newspapers as, largely, \u201chyperventilating from the usual suspects \u2013 some with such intensity it seemed they might spontaneously combust\u201d \u2013 although he joked the attention was likely better than \u201cbeing ignored\u201d. During a question and answer session on Sunday at the Chifley Research Centre conference, the treasurer said \u201cthere\u2019s a contrast between some of that coverage and what you pick up in investor circles\u201d. \u201cPeople get into habits. I think people get into a habit of what their views are, and some habits were formed some time ago. That is not the case in the investor community and the international community, so I think there is a bit of a disconnect there.\u201d Some of the criticism portrayed Chalmers\u2019s support for values-based capitalism as a departure from Labor\u2019s policy approach in the 1980s and 1990s. But the treasurer said the Albanese government would not be a facsimile of past Labor governments because the current government had to rise to meet contemporary challenges rather than mimic the shibboleths of the past. \u201cMy view about the changes of the last 40 years is there is much to commend, particularly in the Australian context, particularly when it comes to the Hawke-Keating legacy,\u201d Chalmers said on Sunday. \u201cBut our job now is to make our own way in the 2020s, in this defining decade.\u201d He said the \u201csame things that worked for Paul in 1983 are not going to be the same things I reach for in 2023\u201d. Chalmers said people expecting he would be a carbon copy of Keating as treasurer was \u201cas absurd as someone saying to Paul when he fronted up to the Treasury for the first time 40 years ago and saying what we need to do is a photocopy of Ben Chifley\u2019s policies as treasurer 40 years earlier. \u201cYou can believe in markets, you can believe in the important role of the private sector as I do \u2026 but what we need to do is a much better job of working out how do we better design and define and inform our markets so that we get the right kind of economic outcomes but also, ideally, outcomes that align with our values and our society.\u201d"

                    "body": " The surest sign of consistent quality in European club rugby is visible just above the heart. Those four little gold stars woven into Leinster\u2019s jersey might not immediately catch everyone\u2019s eye but if you know, you know. Each of them denotes a European Cup title and adding another on Saturday will gain the Irish province entry to the most rarefied of clubs. Currently the French thoroughbreds of Stade Toulousain are the sole occupants of this elite five-star enclosure, courtesy of victory over La Rochelle in last year\u2019s final. Next up, after Leinster, are Toulon and Saracens with three while Munster, Leicester and Wasps are the only other teams to have raised the trophy more than once. In the past 20 years only one side from outside that magnificent seven \u2013 Exeter \u2013 have conquered Europe. Leinster\u2019s recent form strongly suggests they could draw level with Toulouse this weekend. Of course, Ronan O\u2019Gara\u2019s La Rochelle beat them in last year\u2019s semi-final and nothing can be remotely guaranteed. But should Leo Cullen\u2019s side prevail in Marseille it would be the fifth time in 14 seasons the trophy has ended up in Dublin. Considering the opposition involved over that period, that would be some achievement.  Which inevitably kickstarts one of those subjective pub arguments. Are Leinster on the verge of becoming the greatest European club side of the pro era? There will be plenty of spluttering in France but, increasingly, there is a strong case to be made. Not just in terms of trophies but the manner in which they are increasingly getting the job done. It is all very well saying the English league leaders, Leicester, started slowly in the  quarter-final at Welford Road or that Toulouse were below their best in the semi. That is what top sides do: even decent opponents are made to look moderate. And when you looked at the scoreboard at the end of both of those matches, against sides containing some top-notch individuals, the aggregate was 63-31. At which point another familiar cry goes up: they should be good, they\u2019re Ireland in disguise. Which is mostly true in terms of personnel. But, conversely, what if it is Leinster\u2019s excellence that has filtered upwards to Ireland\u2019s national team rather than vice versa? And either way, is that not the perfect yardstick by which to judge whether a club (or provincial) side truly are the real deal? So let\u2019s proceed accordingly. Two of the greatest European champions in terms of the quality of their title-winning performances were the Brive side of 1997 and Leicester in 2001. But while Brive were simply scintillating in Cardiff, carving open the Tigers to win 28-9, they did not necessarily boast a team full of internationals. Their flying winger S\u00e9bastien Carrat was a French national sprinter, for example, but he never won a cap for Les Bleus.  Leicester\u2019s forwards, however, were pretty much the England pack in disguise, with the talented Pat Howard, Geordan Murphy and Austin Healey outside them. Their 34-30 victory over Stade Fran\u00e7ais in Paris was also as compelling a finale as any in the tournament\u2019s history. There is only one snag: having retained the trophy the following year they have drawn a Champions Cup blank over the past 20 years. Despite the fabled deeds of Munster and the famous knockout acumen of Wasps, then, the all-time shortlist arguably has to be whittled down to four: Toulouse, Leinster, Toulon and Saracens. Toulon were as star-dusted a side as the competition has ever known and no other team have won three consecutive titles. The most eye catching, without doubt, was their 23-6 humbling of Saracens in 2014 when Matt Giteau and Juan Smith scored the tries, Jonny Wilkinson kicked the goals and Steffon Armitage \u2013 remember him? \u2013 claimed the man-of-the-match award. Sarries, too, had some extra-special moments, not least in Newcastle in 2019 when they overpowered Leinster. Maybe there would have been more titles had the salary cap saga not intervened. Toulouse, meanwhile, stand out for their longevity and sustained pedigree, although two of their five final wins were achieved in extra-time and the combined winning margins of the other three were a modest 12 points. Arguably the final in which they played some of their most compelling rugby was in 2004 against Wasps at Twickenham, which they lost courtesy of Cl\u00e9ment Poitrenaud\u2019s late howler.  For my euros, though, the two most striking all-round European sides \u2013 capable of playing in a variety of ways, with power and panache and with sustained Test-class excellence \u2013 have been Toulon and the modern-day Leinster. Nothing, it should be stressed once again, is yet settled but the Dubliners are still improving. They can scrummage with the best of them and their tighthead can throw 25-metre passes in open play. Their back row never take a step backwards and neither do their midfield. They possess a high-level kicking game \u2013 out of hand and off the tee \u2013 and their half-backs are tactically outstanding. When Leinster really up the tempo there is a savage beauty to their clinical execution. So who would win if the Toulon of 2014 played the Leinster of 2022? Shifting the tickets would not be a problem, that\u2019s for sure. Never mind Wilkinson and Giteau, what about Bakkies Botha, Carl Hayman, Jean-Mart\u00edn Fern\u00e1ndez Lobbe and Bryan Habana? With Martin Castrogiovanni, Ali Williams and Mathieu Bastareaud as back-up? Perhaps best not to bet the Monte Carlo-based yacht on an Irish romp. But should Leinster win well on Saturday the \u201cultimate\u201d question can legitimately be raised. Right now Johnny Sexton, Jamison Gibson-Park, Tadhg Furlong, Josh van der Flier, Robbie Henshaw and the rest of their squad of hungry internationals are displaying a rhythm and certainty exhibited by only the very best. A fifth gold star on their jerseys this weekend would truly cement their lofty status."

He made only four starts for Madrid this season, three of those coming in August. The 32-year-old has barely played since, being injured for long periods and out of favour with Carlo Ancelotti. He spent the 2020-21 season at loan at Tottenham, from where he had joined Madrid for a fee thought to be \u20ac100m in 2013.\nBale leaves having won the Champions League five times, though this season he played seven minutes in the competition, and been part of three La Liga-winning squads. His spectacular goal against Liverpool in the 2018 Champions League final put Madrid 2-1 up and he sealed victory with another strike.\n\u201cI write this message to say thank you to all my teammates, past and present, my managers, the backroom staff and to the fans that supported me,\u201d Bale wrote. \u201cI arrived here nine years ago as a young man who wanted to realise my dream of playing for Real Madrid.\n\u201cTo wear the pristine white kit, to wear the crest on my chest, to play at the Santiago Bernab\u00e9u, to win titles and to be part of what it\u2019s so famous for, to win the Champions League. I can now look back, reflect and say with honesty that this dream became a reality and much, much more.\n\n\u201cTo be a part of this club\u2019s history and to achieve what we achieved while I was a Real Madrid player, has been an incredible experience and one I will never forget. I also want to thank president Florentino P\u00e9rez, Jos\u00e9 \u00c1ngel S\u00e1nchez [the managing director], and the board for giving me the opportunity to play for this club.\n\u201cTogether we were able to create some moments that will live forever in the history of this club and football. It has been an honour. Thank you! HALA MADRID!\u201d\nBale is part of the Wales squad who play a Nations League match in Poland on Wednesday and face Scotland or Ukraine in a World Cup playoff final in Cardiff on Sunday."

                    "body": "Of all of the elementary milestones that Emma Raducanu had not yet notched up before she won the US Open so early into her career, few are as unbelievable as what awaits her as she leads Great Britain into battle against the Czech Republic in Prague on her Billie Jean King Cup debut. On Friday, Raducanu will compete in a professional clay court match for the first time. As she has prepared for this moment recently, Raducanu\u2019s unfamiliarity on the surface is reflected on her body: \u201cI have no toenails,\u201d said Raducanu, laughing, after the draw ceremony. \u201cJust my foot, my shoes, they\u2019ve just been sliding around a lot.\u201d Anne Keothavong, the GB captain, joked that the rest of the team is \u201cscarred\u201d by the sight of her nails.  Raducanu remembers travelling to the Czech Republic to compete in a junior club league on clay aged 11, one of her first tennis trips abroad. Otherwise, her clay court experience amounts to a few brief summers on the surface and nine ITF junior tournaments, her last match coming being four years ago. How clay matches up with her game will be an interesting sight. Raducanu has so far enjoyed her success on grass and faster hard courts that complement her preference for taking the ball on the rise inside the baseline. The slow, high-bouncing clay rewards those who are also capable of carefully opening the court by generating topspin and width from behind it. \u201cI genuinely believe that clay could be one of my strongest surfaces because [of] the moving aspect,\u201d she said. \u201cI do like moving \u2026 because I feel like I have a lot more potential physically. And I do enjoy sliding. After spending more time on this surface I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll time it better and learn more about the surface, but also just the time that clay brings.\u201d At the beginning of the month, Raducanu spent a number of days training on clay at the Piatti tennis centre in Italy. Rumours circulated about further personnel changes in her team, but she explained that she had opted to train there in order to adapt to clay courts while her coach, Torben Beltz, took a holiday with his family. \u201cOf course he needed that family time. So I thought I might as well take the opportunity to go to Italy and spend some more time on the dirt,\u201d she said. This has been a tough first full season so far for Raducanu, with a 2-5 win-loss record, various injury niggles and many tight three-set losses from winning positions. But expectations are extremely low on clay and she may well enjoy being more under the radar for now. A young Great Britain team stands alongside her as they look for an unlikely victory. Harriet Dart continues to sit around her new career high ranking after breaking the top 100 with her recent run to the Indian Wells fourth round last month. However, she is also unproven on clay.  The squad is completed by 23-year-old Katie Swan and 20-year-old Sonay Kartal. After struggling with injuries in recent years, Kartal has flitted up the rankings swiftly. She was unranked and inactive at the beginning of October, yet has since compiled a 31-3 record on the ITF circuit, catapulting her to a career high ranking of 370th. She and Raducanu, who calls Kartal a \u201cball machine\u201d, grew up together, forming a rivalry immortalized by the viral video of them playing an endless rally against each other aged nine: \u201cI\u2019d always end up playing you in the final and we would just alternate between who would win that week,\u201d said Kartal, addressing Raducanu. \u201cBut, I mean, I\u2019m still proud of that on-the-run forehand past you.\u201d  What awaits Great Britain as they attempt to win the qualifier and reach the Billie Jean King Cup finals later this year is the enormous challenge of facing the defining women\u2019s team over the past decade, with the Czechs having won six BJK Cup titles since 2011. Despite being without their top three players, Barbora Krejcikova, Karolina Pliskova and Petra Kvitova, plus Katerina Siniakova, the doubles No 1, their depth is so great that they can still easily piece together a solid, deep team, and they remain considerablecomfortable favourites. The 2019 French Open finalist Marketa Vondrousova, ranked 32nd, will open up the tie against Dart and then No 50 Tereza Martincova will face Raducanu. Waiting in the wings is the immensely talented Karolina Muchova, who is only ranked outside of the top 20 because of significant injury issues, and Marie Bouzkova. Even their fifth selection is a statement, the talented 16-year-old Linda Fruhvirtova underlining a dominant era that is far from over."

The two standout sides in the Women\u2019s Super League delivered a compelling contest in front of the largest crowd to watch a game of women\u2019s rugby league, with almost 6,000 people in attendance before the two men\u2019s Challenge Cup semi-finals later in the afternoon.  With the score finely poised at 8-8 heading into the final quarter, a missed penalty from Leeds\u2019s Courtney Winfield-Hill kept the game level and Saints took their opportunity with two tries to secure the cup. The outstanding Jodie Cunningham forced her way over the line from close range to nudge Derek Hardman\u2019s side ahead for the first time. Then, with three minutes remaining, Partington added to her earlier try by converting in the corner following a superb pass from Amy Hardcastle. It means St Helens retain their position as the dominant force in the women\u2019s game and their quest for a second successive treble remains intact. The valiant Rhinos led in the early stages when Georgia Roche\u2019s pass led to Zoe Hornby breaking the deadlock, but St Helens soon hit back when Zoe Harris\u2019s kick found Leah Burke.  Beth Stott dragged the conversion wide to keep Saints behind by two, before Winfield-Hill landed a long-range penalty on the stroke of half-time to move Leeds into an 8-4 lead. Partington\u2019s try after an error from Tasha Gaines brought the scores level, before Winfield-Hill spurned a glorious chance to put Leeds back in front with 15 minutes remaining. Saints made the Rhinos and Winfield-Hill pay when Cunningham forced her way through a gap to move them ahead, before Partington sealed victory in the closing moments."

                    "body": "LAGE TOPPED? With 32 minutes to go, his side two down and in desperate need of a goal against West Ham, Bruno Lage looked to the Wolves bench and surveyed his options. It spoke volumes that the best of them was a seemingly unfit striker who hadn\u2019t played a competitive game of football in 11 months, but on waddled a ring-rusty Diego Costa for his first experience of English action since scoring for Chelsea in the 2017 FA Cup final. There was to be no repeat, even if this tribute act did play his greatest hits, snarling and sh1thousing his way through the final half-hour, even going so far as to steer a good headed opportunity wide. With just three goals to their name in eight top-flight matches this season, it was a familiar story for Wolves. Lage\u2019s touchline Hail Mary had failed to pay off and it came as no great shock when news filtered through on Sunday that he had been fired. If only he\u2019d resisted the urge to loan the unstoppable goal machine that is Conor Coady out to Everton, eh? With Lage now saying his goodbyes and packing his chattels into a cardboard box, Ralph Hasenh\u00fcttl is the new favourite in the bookies\u2019 Sack Race market after three consecutive defeats. With a trip to Manchester City next up, even the patience of his Saintly overlords could be tested to its limit should Erling Haaland and his support cast cut loose and pile more hurt on Southampton next weekend. No strangers to 9-0 gubbings, on current form they\u2019ll do well just to prevent the Norseman from becoming the first player in Premier League history from scoring back-to-back-to-back hat-tricks in the same game. But before betting on Hasenh\u00fcttl to be the next top-flight manager to collect his P45, it might be worth waiting to see how Monday\u2019s six-pointer between Leicester and Nottingham Forest goes, what with the next two managers in the market taking their places in adjacent technical areas at the King Power Stadium. Occupying the bottom two places of the table, Leicester and Forest had wildly contrasting summers in the transfer market. The Foxes lost several key players and bought almost nobody except the Belgian Sideshow Bob, while the newly-promoted club with whom they have long enjoyed a bitter rivalry lost an entire platoon of personnel and brought in so many replacements they are all still wearing name-tags and are expected to arrive in Leicester on board a convoy of buses. Having conveyed the impression of a man who would genuinely welcome the bullet in recent months, Brendan Rodgers is probably in the less tenable position, but football being football, it would be no great shock to see Steve Cooper get his cards from Forest\u2019s famously \u201cunconventional\u201d owner, Evangelos Marinakis, should they lose their fifth game on the spin. This clash marks a real race to the bottom, even if it doesn\u2019t hold a candle to its far more grim counterpart taking place in the Birmingham Conference Centre less than an hour\u2019s drive away. QUOTE OF THE DAY \u201cOur beloved sport is sick, especially in Europe, and, of course, in Spain. Football is losing its position as the world\u2019s leading global sport. The most worrying fact is that young people are becoming less and less interested in football. The current competitions, as they are designed today, do not attract spectators\u2019 interest, except in the final stages\u201d \u2013 Real Madrid chief suit Florentino P\u00e9rez there, still banging the same old tired drum as he tries to flog the \u00a3$L again.

                    "body": "The day after the craziness and pulse a little closer to resting levels Pep Guardiola did as he always does. The Manchester City manager looked into his laptop to run through the forensic debrief and he pressed pause.\nGuardiola would have done so in the 73rd minute of the 2-2 thriller with Liverpool at the Etihad Stadium when Gabriel Jesus worked an opening to the right of goal. Kevin De Bruyne was on for the cut-back. Just pass it to Kevin. But no. Jesus still shoots into the side net and 50,000 voices still scream at him \u2013 most vociferously that of De Bruyne.\n\nThe moment that had haunted Guardiola after the game, which he referenced with such overt frustration, would not have looked any better, either. Phil Foden to De Bruyne to Riyad Mahrez, the substitute, in the 94th minute. Pause. The first-time touch into Foden still looks on, although Mahrez has clearly made up his mind to jink inside. Pause again. The pass to Foden appears an even better bet now. Play. Mahrez still sends the chipped shot high.\nGuardiola understood. For him there can be no recriminations, particularly not after such a dynamic team performance; a day when he got so much right, including his selection of Jesus and Raheem Sterling in the front line. Their runs in behind the Liverpool defence caused all manner of problems, testing the recovery pace of the centre-halves and even making Virgil van Dijk look a little edgy at times.\n\u201cI make \u2018pause\u2019 \u2026 the game stops, nobody moves \u2026 don\u2019t pass the ball there,\u201d Guardiola said. \u201cBut in football, they have to make a decision in half a second. And it\u2019s difficult, always. My reaction on the bench \u2026 Aaargh, how we don\u2019t do it? Hands moving around. But after, I understand them. It\u2019s difficult sometimes and, in the final third, in the box, it\u2019s the most difficult position.\u201d\n\nGuardiola talked about a missed opportunity, how City had allowed Liverpool to remain alive in the Premier League title race when they might have killed them. But the over-riding feeling has been one of satisfaction, of confidence for the battles ahead \u2013 the next of which comes at Atl\u00e9tico Madrid on Wednesday night in the Champions League quarter-final; City are 1-0 up from the first leg. Then it is Liverpool again in the FA Cup semi-final at Wembley on Saturday. And who knows? It could yet be City v Liverpool in the Champions League final.\nThere has been much said and written about J\u00fcrgen Klopp\u2019s nine career victories against Guardiola teams; four of which came when the Liverpool manager was in charge at Borussia Dortmund and Guardiola was at Bayern Munich. No manager has won more against Guardiola. For the record Guardiola also has nine victories while there have now been five draws.\nBut Guardiola has been the boss over the past four seasons, winning four of the nine contests in all competitions and losing only one. On Sunday his players made many more good decisions than bad; they created plenty and gave up relatively little. There was a parallel to the 2-2 draw at Anfield from earlier in the season in that City might have been out of sight at half-time. Yes, the profligacy at the big moments is a worry but more important is that the moments are being created.\n\nGuardiola knows it is about the performance levels and so does De Bruyne, who is in electric form. \u201cWe played a good game and we deserved to win,\u201d he said. \u201cBut in the end we take it. They have quality and we did not give too much away.\u201d\nWhat was clear from within the City camp was how much they respected Liverpool for coming to play, which was in stark contrast to the approach of Atl\u00e9tico from the previous Tuesday. The Spanish team did not muster a single shot during the first leg.\n\u201cAgainst Atl\u00e9tico \u2026 where you play against such a defensive wall, it is not the best game to play or watch,\u201d De Bruyne said. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing we can do about it. If a team comes here to play, it is always a good game and Liverpool come here to play the way they play.\u201d\n\nAtl\u00e9tico will plainly present a different challenge and, for City, the schedule is unforgiving. Pause and recover on Monday. Travel on Tuesday. No time to train, as Guardiola says. Then play. It will be the same routine leading up to the FA Cup semi-final.\nGuardiola is conscious that Liverpool are at home in their Champions League quarter-final, second leg on Wednesday night against Benfica. \u201cI could say: \u2018Oh, thank you so much Premier League \u2026 you could give us an extra day,\u201d Guardiola says. \u201cBut how? In this country, it\u2019s impossible. And I love that because it will show whether you can overcome the bad moments and play.\u201d\nDe Bruyne is also in the groove. \u201cIt would be nice to think about the end of the season [title run-in] but you don\u2019t get the time,\u201d he says. \u201cThat is maybe a good thing because you just play, play, play and then we will see what happens. I think the Atl\u00e9tico game will be a little bit tight at the beginning but it has to change if the score stays the same. I don\u2019t expect it to be a similar game to the first leg.\u201d"

Back then, my doona covers were white with embroidered flowers.\u201d Meanwhile, Zamora\u2019s friends slept under the joyful and riotous colours of Australian artist Ken Done. She wanted in. It was the start of a sustained passion for the art and products of Done.  \u201cUsually on a day-to-day basis there is some Ken Done on my person \u2013 usually a handbag or something,\u201d says Zamora, who now lives in Melbourne. \u201cI\u2019ve met him [Ken Done] a number of times. I\u2019ve purchased a few things from the gallery.\u201d One of Zamora\u2019s most treasured pieces is a Done drawing on a napkin. \u201cA friend of mine accosted him in his art store one day and said, \u2018So sorry to bother you, my friend Sweetie is a gigantic fan\u2019, and said it was my birthday. And he said, \u2018Oh yeah, I know her.\u2019\u201d Done then took a napkin and a blue pen and drew the Sydney Harbour Bridge emblazoned with her name, along with a happy birthday message. \u201cThat one is very important because it is very specific to me.\u201d  Whenever Zamora\u2019s friends meet Done, they feel compelled to mention her fandom. \u201cI find it funny that the breadth of my love for Ken and the art he makes finds its way through groups of friends,\u201d she says. \u201cThey say, \u2018I know this superfan \u2026\u2019\u201d As well as collecting Done-branded linen and clothing, Zamora has three original paintings in her house.  \u201cNovember Reef was a gift from my mum. She bought it from an auction. There is Zebra Fish, which was my first purchase in my mid-20s. \u201cThen I bought Mask in 2021 during the pandemic. I had just broken up with my partner and was in Sydney for a brief moment, and went into the gallery. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen that style from him before and I could not shake that feeling of being very attached to that painting.\u201d A year later, Zamora still had the painting on her mind. She emailed the gallery and there was one left. Mask is painted from the perspective of a snorkeler. \u201cHe uses the whole of the canvas all the way to the edge,\u201d she says. \u201cThere\u2019s something so beautiful when you are looking out of a mask \u2013 you are focusing on whatever is in front you.\u201d As well as artwork, \u201cI definitely have done full Ken Done outfits. When I used to wear double Done \u2026 people would be like, \u2018Woah, you\u2019re a lot!\u2019\u201d Does she want to be friends with Done? \u201cI like there being a bit of disconnect but if he said, \u2018Hey, come around to the house for a cup of tea\u2019, I wouldn\u2019t say no. I am happy to leave him and his life be and to be an admirer on the sidelines.\u201d  Do you have a treasured artwork you would like to share the story behind?

                    "body": "The journalist Andrew Jennings, who has died aged 78 of an aortic aneurysm, did more than any other to expose systemic corruption within the organisations running world sport. In the process he helped to ensure that the International Olympic Committee underwent reform and to bring down the bosses of the football governing body Fifa. This he achieved through applying what he had learned from investigating crime and police corruption as a press and broadcasting reporter. For Andrew journalism was not a job \u2013 it was a mission. In 2000 the New York Times described him as \u201cusually outraged and frequently outrageous\u201d. One of his own definitions of investigative journalism was: \u201cIdentify the enemy and destroy them.\u201d But relentless pursuit was backed up by sound tradecraft. Incriminating documents were handed to Andrew by sources he had spent years building relationships with. Some became friends. At the IOC, the key figure was its president, Juan Antonio Samaranch. Andrew\u2019s first book on the Olympic movement, The Lords of the Rings: Power, Money and Drugs in the Modern Olympics (1992), with Vyv Simson, offended Samaranch, and on his behalf the IOC successfully sued the pair in a Swiss court in 1994 for libel. Andrew ignored the verdict and resulting five-day suspended sentence. Two more books followed: The New Lords of the Rings (1996) and, with his partner, Clare Sambrook, The Great Olympic Swindle (2000). The Salt Lake City Olympic bidding scandal dramatically demonstrated the corruption and freeloading Andrew did so much to unmask and Samaranch was forced to reform the IOC. Rejecting calls to resign, he stepped down in 2001 after the Sydney Olympics. Of football Andrew knew little, but he did know how to provoke a reaction. \u201cPresident Blatter, have you ever taken a bribe?\u201d was his opening gambit to Fifa\u2019s president, Sepp Blatter, and a shocked press conference at its Zurich headquarters in 2002. \u201cI cannot be bribed,\u201d Blatter responded \u2013 he consistently denied wrongdoing \u2013 but Andrew\u2019s question served as a deliberate invitation to anyone who wanted to help expose corruption at Fifa: Andrew was the man to talk to. It worked, and he was soon being handed plastic carrier bags of documents that made him expert on the corrupt awarding of World Cups and payments resulting from broadcasting rights, sponsorship and merchandising. This approach was not always popular in the UK. In 2010, a source handed over a list of $100m of bribes to sports officials including three members of Fifa\u2019s executive committee. The Panorama report that I produced with Andrew was broadcast that November, just days before the committee voted for which countries would host the 2018 and 2022 World Cups. The Sun branded the BBC \u201cBrainless, Betraying, Cretinous\u201d and, to Andrew\u2019s raucous laughter, we were accused of being \u201cunpatriotic\u201d by England\u2019s bid team. It transpired that the decisions were indeed already as good as made. Three days later Fifa\u2019s executive committee \u201cvoted\u201d for Russia and Qatar, and now cries of outrage were directed against Fifa. Agents from the US justice department wanted to talk to Andrew. He forwarded me their email at the BBC, observing gleefully that it was \u201cunwise to do bribery scams in US dollars\u201d. For Andrew, Fifa was an organised crime syndicate, and he handed over material about tax evasion by the executive committee member Chuck Blazer to the FBI and the US tax authority, the IRS. Blazer became an undercover informant, and in 2015 seven Fifa officials were arrested on charges of racketeering, conspiracy and corruption. Blatter was banned from football by Fifa that year, and again in 2021. Andrew was born in Kirkcaldy, Fife, the son of Edith (nee Casbourne) and Edward Jennings, who at the time was serving in the RAF. When the second world war was over the family moved to London, where Edward was a headteacher. After studying at Watford technical high school, Bushey grammar school and South West Herts College of Further Education, Andrew went to Hull University. But rather than completing a degree in social administration he investigated the trawler sinkings that afflicted the city in 1968, with 58 people from three boats dying in three weeks. National papers paid him for his findings, he worked for the Sunday Times\u2019 Insight team, and he joined the staff of the Burnley Evening Star. From there he went to the Daily Express, and in the early 1970s to the BBC radio consumer show Checkpoint. In 1982 he became a reporter for the Watchdog team on the weekday TV current affairs programme Nationwide.  Two years later he joined the Brass Tacks series, but his career at the BBC came to an end in 1986 when he characteristically resigned after a report on corruption in the Metropolitan police was shelved without being broadcast. He took himself and the story to Granada\u2019s World in Action, where later he was joined by Simson, who had been his producer at the BBC. Together with Paul Lashmar and Simson, he wrote Scotland Yard\u2019s Cocaine Connection (1989). It was his World in Action colleague Paul Greengrass who suggested Andrew have a look at corruption in international sporting associations. As Andrew later observed: \u201cPaul went to Hollywood and I dug into the International Olympic Committee.\u201d  His Fifa campaign also yielded a book, FOUL! The Secret World of FIFA: Bribes, Vote-Rigging and Ticket Scandals (2006), documenting corruption at the organisation running the world\u2019s favourite sport. Its publication coincided with the first of five films that Andrew made with me for Panorama. These featured his often humorous attempts to talk to Fifa\u2019s leaders about corruption as he doorstepped them outside plush hotels, in the street, or arriving at airports. Trinidad\u2019s Fifa executive committee member Jack Warner responded to polite questions about his dubious ticket deal as he arrived at Zurich airport by telling a delighted Andrew that he\u2019d \u201cspit on\u201d him. In another encounter in Trinidad, Warner responded with \u201cGo fuck yourself\u201d. This made for revealing TV, and Warner was one of those indicted on the eve of Fifa\u2019s congress in Zurich in 2015. Andrew saw the Swiss authorities\u2019 ensuing investigation into Blatter as \u201ca day of righteous justice\u201d.  A few weeks later Andrew suffered a severe stoke while filming in New York. Incredibly, after he was flown back to the UK, a combination of singing therapy and determination enabled him to record the commentary for the completed programme. It ended with Andrew gazing at a large picture of Blatter, the man who had been the focus of so much of his work. Turning towards the camera he addressed the audience with a sparkle in his eyes: \u201cI told you he was a crook.\u201d He is survived by Clare and two of their children, Henry and Rosie. Two daughters, twins, were born and died in 1998. Andrew is also survived by his daughter, Sophie, from his marriage to Janeen Weir, who died in 1974, and by his stepchildren, Belinda and Tim. \u2022 Edward Arthur Andrew Jennings, journalist and film-maker, born 3 September 1943; died 8 January 2022"

                    "body": "Everyone looks tired. Liverpool counterattack in the closing minutes and Trent Alexander-Arnold (41 games for club and country this season) can barely puff his way over the halfway line. In stoppage time, Riyad Mahrez (45 games) runs at Andy Robertson (46 games), who tries and forlornly fails to keep pace with him. Bernardo Silva (49 games) looks exhausted as he scores Manchester City\u2019s second goal. On the touchline a world-weary Pep Guardiola \u2013 who has barely left his bench all half \u2013 grimaces as if suddenly contemplating the solemn and unappetising prospect of extra time. Even as the final whistle arrives to seal Liverpool\u2019s triumph, there is no great celebration, no great delight, and no great anguish either. John Stones and Phil Foden sink to their knees. Liverpool\u2019s players gather each other into pained embraces: partly in satisfaction, partly in relief and partly just to hold each other up. Gingerly and groggily, both teams acknowledge their fans and trudge down the tunnel. An ice bath, a protein pot, a bus ride, a charter flight, and then bed. There\u2019s training in the morning. Manchester United come to Anfield on Tuesday and Brighton to the Etihad Stadium on Wednesday. We move.  And naturally, all of this will soon be forgotten. The written record will simply show that Liverpool beat Manchester City 3-2 to reach the 2022 FA Cup final. It won\u2019t show that City were still recovering from a bruising, attritional Champions League second leg against Atl\u00e9tico Madrid on Wednesday, while Liverpool were able to rest the majority of their first team at home against Benfica. By the same token, if Liverpool fail to beat United this week, handing City a decisive advantage in the Premier League title race, nobody will remember their exertions at Wembley three days earlier. This is the brutality of elite football: you win, you lose, and how you felt at the time is of no relevance whatsoever. Certainly none of the City squad were prepared to admit to fatigue as a reason for their haggard, careless performance here. \u201cI\u2019m not going to sit here and say excuses,\u201d Jack Grealish (41 games and a shin injury) retorted to the suggestion that four high-level games in 12 days might have taken their toll. \u201cThat\u2019s what you\u2019re going to get when you\u2019re at Manchester City. You\u2019re always in competitions at the end of the season.\u201d Oleksandr Zinchenko (a paltry 22 games) insisted: \u201cEveryone was ready to play. We can be tired mentally, but you have to sort out these things at this level.\u201d  And yet teams at the peak of fitness do not keep banging the drum about player welfare, as J\u00fcrgen Klopp has been doing for most of the last few years. Coaches with a fresh and hungry squad at their disposal do not wait until the 83rd minute of a losing semi-final to make their first substitution. Mahrez was Guardiola\u2019s one change of the game, and introduced only after Gabriel Jesus (40 games) had started limping. Afterwards Guardiola essentially admitted that Kevin De Bruyne (41 games) was included on the bench despite not being fit to play, after a foot injury suffered against Atl\u00e9tico. Aymeric Laporte (43 games), R\u00faben Dias (39 games), Rodri (43 games) and Ilkay G\u00fcndogan (43 games) are all somewhere on the sliding scale from fatigue to collapse. Fans of rival teams may be tempted to play the world\u2019s smallest violin at this point. But as this season sharpens down, as Liverpool pursue their historic quadruple and City\u2019s campaign tapers towards the biggest two prizes of all, it is the physical aspect that remains the great unknown here, the dark matter, the biggest gamble of all. Do you prioritise continuity, familiarity, rhythm? Or do you play the long game, and try to stretch out your resources as evenly and efficiently as possible?  Perhaps unsurprisingly, Klopp and Guardiola have sharply differed in this respect. While Klopp has a trusted hardcore of around seven or eight first-team players \u2013 Alisson, Alexander-Arnold, Robertson, Virgil van Dijk, Fabinho, Mohamed Salah, Sadio Man\u00e9, Jo\u00ebl Matip \u2013 who will start virtually all big games if fit, Guardiola has been much happier to rest and rotate all season. It probably cost him this semi-final, as a team bearing seven changes ended up being outmatched all over the pitch. Most damning of all was the decision to start the unfortunate Zack Steffen in goal: not so much an elite goalkeeper as the actor who would play an elite goalkeeper in a Hollywood football adaptation. It was a gamble. You might be tempted to conclude that it failed. But if at some point over the next seven Premier League games Ederson (44 games) has to sprint out of his area to meet an opposition striker, then those saved legs, those miles not run, might prove the difference between a successful clearance and a straight red card. These are the margins at which teams like City and Liverpool operate these days: a game of strategies and power outputs and 4D chess, where entire campaigns can rise and fall on the data coming out of the medical department.  Then, of course, there is the mental aspect. Alisson lost his father in a tragic drowning accident last year and was unable to travel home for his funeral. Guardiola lost his mother to Covid. Zinchenko\u2019s country is currently in the grip of an inhuman invasion. What sort of private traumas are these guys suppressing and bottling up just to be out there, on the pitch, playing at this ungodly level? What are they putting themselves through to entertain us? We will probably never know. So perhaps the most scintillating element of this three-pronged rivalry is just how high the quality remains, even as both teams chug towards the finish, breathing on fumes, draining every last drop of energy from themselves. The pressing and the passing remain as restless and urgent as ever. The minds persist, even as the bodies protest. Everyone is tired. And yet by some miracle, everyone is still running."

                    "body": "The squeak of rubber soles filled the arena, the smell of popcorn and hotdogs was in the air and the atmosphere was electric. It was Manchester in 1999, but this was not an Oasis concert, or even a Manchester United match. It was the British Basketball League (BBL) title-decider between the Manchester Giants and Sheffield Sharks. Sheffield eventually clinched the league title on a last-second, game-winning jump-shot. That it would be the high-water mark of the BBL wouldn\u2019t have crossed the minds of any of the 11,000 in attendance that day. Nor would it have occurred to those watching at home, live on Sky Sports. Or the sponsors who had thrown their weight behind the league \u2013 Budweiser took naming rights that year, but were joined by Playboy and Peugeot \u2013 in the expectation of Britain going basketball mad in the new millennium. Chris Finch, currently head coach of the NBA\u2019s Minnesota Timberwolves and the man calling the shots for Sheffield that day, remembers it well. \u201cThat game was emblematic of what the game [in the UK] had the potential to become and, at times, was,\u201d he says. On the Manchester bench was another future NBA head coach: Nick Nurse, who won the NBA title with the Toronto Raptors in 2019.  British basketball was creating such a buzz, in fact, that NTL outbid Sky with a 10-year, \u00a322m contract, but within two years had filed for bankruptcy. ITV Digital picked up the rights but themselves went under 18 months later, robbing the BBL of \u00a321m, untold exposure, and the chance to capitalize on the momentum of British basketball\u2019s big moment. It has struggled to recover ever since, plagued by chronic underfunding and political infighting. To be a British basketball fan in the 21st-century is to live with a series of what-ifs and what-could-have-beens as the game has tried to regain its momentum and release its untapped potential. A return to Sky Sports in recent years has been encouraging, but its home on the broadcaster\u2019s minor channels pales in comparison to its primetime exposure in the late 90s. A \u00a37m investment from Miami-based fund 777 for a 45% stake in the league has made some hopeful again, but for long-term British basketball fans the cyclical disappointments have brought on pessimism; \u2018wait and see\u2019 seems to be the approach for most. It\u2019s why many view that season-finale in 1999 as the high-point of the sport in Britain. \u201cIt was certainly the glory days,\u201d Finch says, \u201cperhaps the pinnacle of basketball in the UK in the last 25 years.\u201d While there are myriad explanations for basketball\u2019s failures in Britain, a lack of popularity is not one of them. According to the Active Lives survey, more than one million British people regularly play basketball, and among those aged 18-34, 14% play every week. That makes it Britain\u2019s joint-second most popular team sport among young people \u2013 after football, of course \u2013 tied with cricket, netball and softball, and ahead of rugby union and rugby league. Sam Neter, the man behind Britain\u2019s biggest basketball media-platform, Hoopsfix, has his finger on the pulse of the UK game better than anyone, and sees that enthusiasm reflected at the grassroots. In children\u2019s basketball, he says, there is simply \u201cmore demand than they can supply.\u201d And of the thousands who play every week, more than half are from an ethnic-minority background, and according to Sport England basketball has the highest proportion of participants in manual and routine work occupations. Basketball is, by any measure, a diverse, working-class sport.  It also enjoys a cultural cachet that eludes more traditional sports like rugby and cricket, and taps into a transatlantic youth culture already firmly established in Britain. American music is laden with basketball references, fashion dominated by its hats, jerseys, and shoes, and British fans sell-out the annual NBA London fixture in minutes. The enthusiasm for basketball certainly exists in Britain, so what\u2019s holding it back? Very simply put: money. A double-pronged lack of funding has always been the problem that underpins all others; at both the elite and grassroots level, British basketball suffers from a severe lack of investment. Between 2013 and 2017 Sport England gave basketball just \u00a39.25 per participant. In contrast, cricket received \u00a370.72 per participant and rugby union almost \u00a360, despite both having fewer participants among young people.  It\u2019s the same story at the elite level. In preparation for the 2012 London Olympics, UK Sport \u2013 the body that funds Great Britain\u2019s Olympic and Paralympic teams \u2013 gave basketball \u00a38m. But \u00a327m went to the rowing programme, almost \u00a323m to sailing, and more than \u00a313m to equestrian teams. For last year\u2019s Tokyo Games, \u00a316m was awarded to canoeing, while bobsleigh (more than \u00a35m) and curling (\u00a35.6m) got healthy injections of cash to prepare for the 2018 Winter Olympics. It doesn\u2019t take a sociologist to understand the different subsections of British society represented in these sports, but the discrepancies are, according to the funding body\u2019s own criteria, logical. UK Sport is motivated by prestige: that is, how likely a team is to win a medal. At London 2012 the men\u2019s team lost by just one point to eventual silver medalists Spain and the women\u2019s team massively improved their international ranking, yet basketball funding was cut completely. While neither team had a realistic chance of winning a medal in 2012, they had promising tournaments and cutting funding meant building on that promise was made almost impossible. And despite it all, British basketball has produced talent beyond its means. Steve Bucknall became the first British NBA player when he suited-up for the Los Angeles Lakers in 1989. Since then, Luol Deng started his career with the Brixton Topcats in London before becoming a two-time NBA All-Star, while Joel Freeland, John Amaechi, and Pops Mensah-Bonsu all had respectable careers in the US. Johannah Leedham, now playing in the WBBL, had a wildly successful career in US college basketball, becoming the NCAA Division II all-time leading scorer. In 2022 there are British players starring across the European leagues. Sixty-seven Britons are playing in the NCAA\u2019s Division I, the elite level of US college basketball. Yet, these talents all have one thing in common: they had to leave in order to succeed. British basketball has, as Neter puts it, \u201cmassive problems with basketball infrastructure that doesn\u2019t allow talent to be nurtured ... by every single objective measure it is massively underfunded.\u201d One British professional who knows that well is Devon Van Oostrum. As one of the most promising prospects Britain has ever produced, he had offers from both sides of the Atlantic but never considered the BBL: \u201cat the time [it] was so far off where I wanted to go,\u201d he explains. After signing with Spanish club Baskonia at the age of 16, his career has taken him to the Greek, Dutch, Lithuanian, Finnish and, for one game only, the British league. He has represented England and Great Britain at every level, played with and against Europe\u2019s top talent, and seen first-hand what makes top leagues successful. For him, the difference is clear. \u201cIf you look at any other league,\u201d he says, \u201cthe best teams have the best homegrown talent.\u201d British basketball has for decades struggled to retain its top talent and develop them in its domestic leagues. Van Oostrum is just one of hundreds who felt his career was best served abroad. \u201cThe talent has always been there,\u201d he adds, \u201cbut the way of playing basketball is just not up to par with the rest of Europe.\u201d British basketball\u2019s lack of talent pathways for elite prospects means it loses them and, very often, never gets them back. \u201cWhat I don\u2019t understand [about the BBL] is why they don\u2019t go after GB players?\u201d Van Oostrum says. \u201cWhy would you not go after them and build around them?\u201d But succeeding against the odds is a trend in British basketball. Off the court it has long-existed as a social remedy for some of the shortcomings of the British state. In Newcastle, the Hoops 4 Health program works with children to promote wellbeing in some of the most deprived parts of the country. Newham All-Star Sports Academy\u2019s Carry a Basketball, not a Blade (CABNAB) works in London to educate young people about the dangers of knife crime. Its founder, Anthony Okereafor, started the scheme after his friend \u201cdied in my arms\u201d and \u201cI realized it could have been me who was stabbed if I hadn\u2019t found basketball,\u201d he says. CABNAB was born and has made a tangible positive impact on Newham\u2019s streets. \u201cFrom when we started in 2008 to 2014, there was a 46% reduction in knife crime-related violence involving young people in our borough,\u201d Okereafor explains.  Why is that? He feels that basketball has a pull that other sports simply don\u2019t: \u201cMost of the NBA stars they see are black or come from countries like Lithuania or Serbia that have a sizable migrant population. Kids from low-income families can relate to basketball stars.\u201d Okereafor is not alone in recognizing the difference basketball can make to lives and communities. But British politicians have thus far been reluctant to tap the sport\u2019s off-the-court potential. In Britain, 12 years of Conservative government has seen youth services cut by 70%. In that time more than 750 youth centers have closed and 4,000 youth workers have been lost. In many communities basketball fills the gaps left in British society by austerity driven public-sector cuts. \u201cGrowing up we had youth clubs, kids zones, after-school clubs and things like that to keep us busy,\u201d Okereafor says. \u201cWith funding cuts and schemes being shut down, there was nowhere for people to go and do something productive.\u201d The All-Party Parliamentary Group on Basketball described \u201cbasketball\u2019s success in addressing the issues relating to education, health, inclusion, opportunities, aspiration, gang culture, anti-social behaviour and meaningful employment.\u201d There is, it concludes, \u201cno more efficient sporting vehicle than basketball to improve outcomes for individuals and communities.\u201d What hoops fans in Britain have known for decades, those in Westminster now know. They, too, see what\u2019s holding the sport back: \u201cthere has been and remains a sustained underfunding \u2026 compared with other high participation team sports,\u201d the parliamentary group concluded. The various factors holding back British basketball are interconnected. Having a properly funded grassroots game to feed the enormous appetite for youth participation will improve coaching, which will improve young talent and feed better players into the club system who, with the proper resources, can retain the top talent and feed them into the BBL and international teams. But putting the slam-dunks and gold medals aside, the fundamental question underlying the British basketball conundrum is a simple one: what is sport for? Does it exist for the prestige of winning medals in elitist sports or is it about providing tangible social good? It seems that, in Britain, you are more likely to receive adequate public sports funding if you are privately-educated and white, or participate in niche sports that involve donning a leotard and launching yourself down an icy obstacle course.  Football, rugby, and cricket are big enough in the UK to generate their own commercial income. But beyond those three, British sports funding bodies are pouring money into elite pastimes played by elites in elite competition along class and racial lines that are uncomfortably familiar in the UK. If basketball was played by white, middle-class Britons, as opposed to working-class minorities in London, or working-class whites in Britain\u2019s northern cities, it is hard to imagine such a dearth in public funding. Boris Johnson has repeatedly promised a \u201cleveling-up\u201d agenda. Perhaps one way of truly leveling-up British society would be to invest in basketball: a sport that already does so much good with so little, and remains massively popular despite it all. British basketball may one day realize its potential, but the diehards in the game know they will most likely have to overcome the obstacles themselves, as they always have. \u201cAin\u2019t nobody coming to save us,\u201d Neter says, \u201cwe gotta do it ourselves.\u201d"

                    "body": "Romelu Lukaku is not thinking about leaving Chelsea this summer and is focused on winning back his place for Sunday\u2019s Carabao Cup final against Liverpool. The striker has struggled since his \u00a397.5m move from Internazionale and there is fresh doubt over his place in Thomas Tuchel\u2019s plans after he was dropped against Lille in the Champions League on Tuesday. Chelsea\u2019s attack was more mobile with Kai Havertz leading the line during the 2-0 victory and Lukaku, an unused substitute, could find himself on the bench again.  That has led to suggestions in Italy that Lukaku is planning to press for a return there at the end of the season. The Belgian has not looked settled in Tuchel\u2019s system and was dropped and fined after giving an unsanctioned interview to Sky Italia in December. However Tuchel\u2019s team selection against Lille has not caused Lukaku to make any decisions over his future. The 28-year-old remains determined to make a success of his second spell at Chelsea, who are tracking Barcelona\u2019s Ousmane Demb\u00e9l\u00e9, and hopes to convince Tuchel to start him at Wembley. It remains to be seen whether Lukaku can do enough in training to regain his place. He had only seven touches when Chelsea beat Crystal Palace last weekend and has scored only 10 goals this season. Tuchel said he wanted to protect Lukaku after his performance against Palace. The manager explained his decision to drop him by saying that the player was mentally and physically tired. However it is understood Lukaku did not feel tired and considered himself ready to start against Lille. Tuchel picked Havertz, who will be confident of keeping his place after scoring the opener against Lille. The 22-year-old gave Chelsea more fluidity in attack and there was also a fine performance from Christian Pulisic. The American winger scored Chelsea\u2019s second goal and will be hopeful of starting again against Liverpool. There is no shortage of choices for Tuchel, who brought on Timo Werner against Lille. Hakim Ziyech is a doubt with an ankle injury but Mason Mount has returned from ankle ligament damage and Callum Hudson-Odoi is close to recovering from an achilles problem. Chelsea, who have concerns over Mateo Kovacic\u2019s fitness after the midfielder limped off against Lille, are monitoring developments regarding Demb\u00e9l\u00e9. The France forward played for Tuchel at Borussia Dortmund and is poised to leave Barcelona on a free at the end of the season.  Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 has struggled with form and injuries since joining Barcelona in 2017though there is nothing advanced with Chelsea, who face competition for the 24-year-old from Paris Saint-Germain. Barcelona remain confident of signing C\u00e9sar Azpilicueta this summer. However they could be forced to pay a small fee because Chelsea have an option to extend the defenders\u2019s deal, which is due to expire at the end of the season. Chelsea did something similar with Olivier Giroud last summer, triggering a one-year extension in the French striker\u2019s contract before selling him to Milan for \u00a31.7m a month later."

                    "body": "Sir Jim Ratcliffe has played down the prospect of making a bid for Manchester United, saying the Glazers do not want to sell and he \u201ccan\u2019t sit around hoping\u201d the club will one day become available. The billionaire chairman of Ineos admitted he had been interested in acquiring United in August after failing to buy Chelsea in the summer. But speaking at an FT Live conference, Ratcliffe suggested he was now more focused on making Nice a serious player in Ligue 1 than buying United.  \u201cI\u2019m a lifelong Manchester United fan,\u201d Ratcliffe said. \u201cAnd I was there in that most remarkable match in 1999 in Barcelona, which is deeply etched in my mind. Manchester United is owned by the Glazer family. I met Joel and Avram, and they are the nicest people. They are gentlemen. And they don\u2019t want to sell. And it\u2019s owned by the six children of the father, and they don\u2019t want to sell. \u201cIf it had been for sale in the summer, yes, we would probably have had a go following on from the Chelsea thing. But we can\u2019t sit around hoping that one day Manchester United will become available.\u201d Ratcliffe, who has a sporting portfolio that includes the Ineos Grenadiers cycling team, a third of the Mercedes F1 team, and Ben Ainslie\u2019s America\u2019s Cup team, did accept he could invest more in football, saying: \u201cThe most popular sport in the world is football, and it\u2019s the sport closest to us, so we should have an asset.\u201d However, when asked whether it could be in the Premier League, he replied: \u201cWell not a Premier League, a premier club. I think Nice has got a very interesting history. It\u2019s an old club and it is a very attractive place for footballers as there is Californian climate down there.\u201d Ratcliffe then went on to note how Manchester City and Paris Saint-Germain had broken into the world\u2019s elite thanks to serious investment. Ratcliffe also claimed that if he had bought Chelsea in the summer he would have run it very differently than the club\u2019s new American owners. \u201cWhen Chelsea came up for sale the three bidders were all American financial institutions,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd so they were looking at Chelsea as a financial asset. Whereas we looked at it as a community asset. So our view was that had we bought Chelsea, we would never have owned Chelsea. We would just have been the custodians for a period of time. It\u2019s like St Paul\u2019s Cathedral. It\u2019s part of the community and you shouldn\u2019t treat it as a financial asset. \u201cAnd, interestingly, they can\u2019t invest in the major football clubs in America. Because America doesn\u2019t allow venture capitalists to buy sports clubs in America. So they come over to the UK and they buy ours.\u201d"

The 17\u2011year\u2011old has received widespread support from the world of football and beyond after he chose to come out on Monday, saying he was \u201cready to tell my story\u201d and also to act as a role model who could \u201chelp others come out\u201d if they wanted to.\nPound is also encouraged by the decisions of Thomas Beattie, a former Hull academy midfielder who played in the US, Canada and Singapore, and the Australian footballer Josh Cavallo to come out in recent years.\n\u201cI do think there will be a domino effect; it\u2019s already started,\u201d said Pound, the director of equality, diversity and inclusion at the Professional Footballers\u2019 Association.\n\u201cIt began when Thomas Beattie came out in 2020. Thomas, Josh Cavallo and now Jake: one man has come out every year since. So we can see the positive impact it can have when people come forward and are visible.\u201d\nDaniels is set to take a brief holiday after an announcement that was months in the planning. The process, described as player-led, involved a number of stakeholders including the PFA and the LGBTQ+ rights group Stonewall. It was seen by those involved as a success and a model which can be repeated to help other players. There is hope that Daniels may be a harbinger of a new era.\n\n\u201cI think there\u2019s certainly a generational aspect to what is happening,\u201d Pound said. \u201cWhen you look at the responses to Jake\u2019s interview, a lot of the comments say: \u2018Why is this a thing?\u2019 Those of us who work in diversity and equality have long talked about creating a \u2018so what?\u2019 culture and it appears there\u2019s a lot of people out there who feel like that now. But you can see from the reaction to Jake\u2019s announcement that it means a huge amount to so many people.\u201d\nPound believes that this generation may also benefit from the years of work in bringing anti\u2011discrimination to the fore in football.\n\u201cWhen we talk about the possibility of abuse I feel strongly that we have moved into an era where it can be dealt with,\u201d Pound said. \u201cWe have strong sanctions for in-stadium abuse and work closely with police. Hopefully we can go further on social media protections, too.\u201d"

The sandwich shop chain, which has more than 400 outlets in the UK, said it was increasing pay by 5% or 50p an hour for most cafe workers from 1 December. Pay for skilled baristas, who are particularly in short supply, will rise from a minimum of \u00a310.30 to \u00a310.85 \u2013 an extra 5p. The boost comes after the workload of baristas increased when Pret introduced a subscription service that offers frequent customers up to five coffees a day for \u00a325 a month.  Workers will also be able to earn an additional \u00a31.25 an hour, based on a weekly mystery shopper assessment. The bonus was increased from \u00a31 in January. Pret said 8,600 staff, including shop managers, baristas and ordinary coffee shop workers would have received an average 13% pay rise this year. The workers earn above the legal minimum wage for those aged 23 and above, which is currently \u00a39.50 an hour.  Guy Meakin, the interim managing director at Pret\u2019s UK &amp; Ireland business, said: \u201cWith the rising cost of living putting increased pressure on our people, we wanted to do more to support them, and to say thank you for continuing to go above and beyond for our customers. \u201cThis will be the second year in a row we will have introduced a second pay rise in the same year for our employees, and we\u2019re proud to be leading the industry on barista pay.\u201d The boost for workers comes just over a year after Pret workers threatened to go on strike after being told the company would cease paying for break times, meaning that someone on an eight-hour shift, including a legally required half-hour break, would receive a pay cut of just over 6% a shift compared with pre-pandemic levels. Pret, which is controlled by JAB Holding Company, a Luxembourg investment vehicle for Germany\u2019s billionaire Reimann family, initially also planned to permanently halve its weekly mystery shopper bonuses to 50p an hour but relented after the Guardian revealed the move, prompting a public outcry. The latest increase will put Pret on a par with Tesco and John Lewis for basic pay and ahead of Sainsbury\u2019s and Marks &amp; Spencer. A string of retailers have now increased pay at least twice in just over a year as the cost of living crisis and staff shortages have forced them to give more in order to retain and recruit workers. Tesco also recently increased pay for shopworkers for the third time in 13 months. Pret increased pay in January and September last year and January this year before the latest increase. The coffee shop chain paid its boss, Pano Christou, \u00a34.2m in the year to the end of December 2021 \u2013 including a near-\u00a34m bonus and double-digit increase in basic pay."

                    "body": "BAYERN BYE\nIn the last 10 years of the old European Cup, before the establishment of Big Cup in 1992, seven clubs won the trophy for the first time in their existence: Hamburg, Juventus, Steaua Bucharest, Porto, PSV, Red Star and Barcelona. The following five years, when Big Cup was still a champions-only affair, another two newbies won the biggest prize of all: Marseille and Borussia Dortmund. But since Big Cup went real big, throwing the doors open to all and sundry (providing they\u2019re big), only one more club has broken through, and they had to meet the oligarch at the crossroads to do it.\nIt\u2019s not been for the want of trying, though, and plenty of clubs searching for that elusive first victory have made it as far as the final. Valencia and Atl\u00e9tico Madrid have taken repeated tilts, the Buffalo Bills and Cincinnati Bengals to Big Cup\u2019s Super Bowl. Bayer Leverkusen, Monaco and Arsenal enlivened the noughties, and the latter might even have won their final had Jens Lehmann not been running around in the Hyperactive Toddler + Sunny D x Jordan Pickford style. And the last three finals have also featured clubs trying to land their maiden Big Cup, it says on a list, although The Fiver is yet to see conclusive proof that any of Spurs, PSG and Manchester City actually turned up on the day. We remain sceptical.\n\nBut perhaps this could be the year for another long-awaited breakthrough. The draw opened up nicely on Tuesday night, as tiny Villarreal rammed Bayern TV\u2019s words \u2013 \u201cIt\u2019s a very manageable draw [laughs, tee hee, guffaw, now for a feast]\u201d \u2013 back down their entitled gullet, while Real Madrid saw off Chelsea in a classic that Christian Pulisic could have won from six yards out, three times over. Admittedly, Madrid have won Big Cup on 13 occasions, but the state of that defence gives Atl\u00e9tico or City a much better chance of making it to the final, which any romantic worth their salt will hope also features the Yellow Submarine. Only the second first-time winner in the last quarter of a century would then be guaranteed! Yay! On the other hand, when it\u2019s Real Madrid and Liverpool again, we\u2019ll promise to try and whip up some excitement, but you\u2019ll know The Fiver\u2019s heart won\u2019t be totally in it.\nLIVE ON BIG WEBSITE!\nJoin Barry Glendenning from 8pm, BST for hot MBM coverage of Atl\u00e9tico Madrid 1-1 Manchester City (agg 1-2) in Big Cup, while Scott Murray takes the helm of Liverpool 2-1 Benfica (agg 5-2).\nQUOTE OF THE DAY\n\u201cI wish to apologise for my comments made in the post-match press conference last night.

                    "body": "Ministers have stepped back from mooted plans to launch a public information campaign to encourage households to reduce their energy use this winter. A campaign asking households to turn their thermostats down and use their dishwashers and washing machines at times when energy demand is lower has been discussed between the business department, energy companies and the network operator National Grid. However, the business department on Wednesday said there are now \u201cno plans for the government to tell the public to reduce usage for the sake of our energy supplies\u201d. National Grid will on Thursday explain how Britain\u2019s power system will cope with a harsh winter, amid growing concern that factories could be forced to shut down as Vladimir Putin chokes Europe\u2019s gas supplies. Ministers have so far played down the threat to energy supplies this winter, insisting in August that the UK\u2019s \u201chighly secure and diverse gas and electricity system\u201d had prepared the UK for \u201call and every eventuality\u201d. Liz Truss also ruled out rationing when she was campaigning to become Tory party leader \u2013 and her credo is not to tell people what to do.  However, Russia has since intensified its squeeze on Europe\u2019s gas supplies, including suspected sabotage of pipelines to Europe. It is understood that officials discussed using a text, phone call and email alert service run by National Grid to contact households about cutting power use. The system is normally used to notify consumers when it detects a power cut and gives timing estimates and confirmation when the power will be restored. Under the mooted plans, consumers could be sent advice on their energy use through the service. Sources close to the discussions said government officials and industry executives were determined to avoid blackouts disrupting the supply of energy to Britons\u2019 homes. A public information campaign could help ease pressure on energy supplies during the winter. Energy rationing could also help to cut the huge bill for capping household and business energy prices, which the consultancy Cornwall Insight reckons will cost taxpayers \u00a389bn. Ofgem, the energy regulator, has said there was a \u201csignificant risk\u201d of gas shortages this winter because of the war in Ukraine, which has resulted in a dash for gas stocks in Europe before winter. National Grid is examining measures to prevent power shortages this winter. Earlier this year, Octopus Energy ran a trial that gave consumers a day\u2019s notice to cut their usage during a peak period in return for payments. National Grid hopes to extend that service, but suppliers have suggested the payments may be too low. National Grid\u2019s outlook for winter energy supplies will be the first comprehensive assessment of the risk of blackouts this winter. The eagerly awaited document should show how resilient Britain\u2019s energy supplies are over the coming months. An early view, published in August, showed that the UK should be able to meet its energy demand in the coming months. However, since then Norway has indicated it may prioritise supplying its domestic market over exporting power. Government analysis has predicted that Britain could experience power cuts for four days in January if there were gas shortages and the weather was particularly severe. Although European countries have made good progress in filling up gas storage facilities and reducing consumption, there are concerns about supplies and high prices through next year. Last week, the Nord Stream Russian gas pipelines under the Baltic Sea were damaged, with Russian sabotage suspected. The European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts this week said Europe could suffer a colder winter with less rain and wind than average. It predicted a period of high pressure over western Europe in November and December, which could reduce the amount of renewable power generated. European governments have attempted to cut consumption through various methods. Germany is trying to cut gas usage by around a fifth and has asked all companies and local authorities to reduce the minimum room temperature in their workspaces to 19C during the winter, and ministers in France are wearing warm clothes to send a message to consumers. A UK industry source said: \u201cThere is still a debate over who is best to offer guidance to households \u2013 government, suppliers or network operators.\u201d However, any messaging campaign would have been at odds with the prime minister\u2019s libertarian principles, and her insistence at the Conservative party conference: \u201cI\u2019m not going to tell you how to live your life.\u201d Asked during the leadership campaign whether she would rule out energy rationing, Truss said: \u201cI do rule that out. Yes.\u201d Jacob Rees-Mogg, the business secretary, when asked on Tuesday about a campaign to save energy, said: \u201cI think the price signal is pretty strong \u2026 The price signal for businesses is similarly scaled. So I\u2019m not sure we need to tell people to do things that are obvious. I\u2019m not in favour of condescending government assuming people are stupid. Voters know what they need to do and don\u2019t need me to tell them to do that.\u201d But the government\u2019s reluctance to tell households to use less energy provoked criticism from Gavin Barwell, a former No 10 chief of staff. \u201cSo, if it is a cold winter and there simply isn\u2019t enough energy to go round \u2013 which is a real risk \u2013 we are just going to have random blackouts rather than the government rationing non-domestic use so that vulnerable people don\u2019t find themselves without heating?\u201d he asked. The UK is far less reliant than some European countries on Russian gas but the scramble for supplies caused by the war in Ukraine has threatened to have a knock-on effect on supplies to Britain. Rees-Mogg is reportedly negotiating deals with two gas exporting countries, Qatar and Norway, over long-term supply contracts that would commit the UK to buying gas in large quantities at an agreed price for more than a decade. That is likely to prompt concerns that the UK\u2019s net zero decarbonisation goals could be at risk. At a Centre for Policy Studies fringe event at the Tory party conference on Tuesday, Rees-Mogg failed to say he was confident the lights would be kept on this winter. \u201cThere will be a report out fairly shortly from the National Grid going through all the risks for the winter, and what may help us and what may not help us, what the options are and what things can be done,\u201d he said. \u201cI think I shouldn\u2019t pre-empt it.\u201d  A business department spokesperson said: \u201cThere are no plans for the government to tell the public to reduce usage for the sake of our energy supplies. The UK has a secure and diverse energy system, and we are confident that the steps we are taking will protect security of electricity and gas supplies.\u201d National Grid declined to comment. \u2022 This article was amended on 5 October 2022.

                    "body": "The Taliban official\u2019s wife apologised for keeping her visit brief. She needed to get her teenage girls ready to fly to Doha, the Qatari capital, where they would shortly be starting a new term, she explained to her host earlier this year. In Kabul, and across much of Afghanistan, girls have not been legally able to attend high school for nearly a year, because of a Taliban ban. Officials insist the ruling is only temporary, but have set no conditions or timeline for lifting it. The ban triggered a wave of depression and anger inside Afghanistan, and widespread revulsion beyond its borders. It also caused less immediately visible splits within the movement itself, reflecting deeper fractures among former insurgents struggling to adjust to running a government. It is an open secret that several senior figures in the leadership educated their own daughters while living outside Afghanistan \u2013 mostly in Pakistan or Qatar \u2013 during their 20-year fight against US forces and their Afghan allies. Some have continued doing so secretly, even after moving back to Kabul, including the family whose international schooling plans were shared with the Observer. Less elite members of the movement have been looking for options closer to home. One secret school for girls in the capital has enrolled the daughters of four or five Taliban families for classes in grades seven to 12, a senior staff member said. One Talib official came to ask personally for a larger-than-usual discount, and teachers told him about the others, he said. \u201cI was scared and also happy that he and the others are in some way invested in the other children in the school now, and will be defending and supporting us.\u201d In the private commitment of some Taliban members to securing an education for their own girls at any cost, other Afghans see both hypocrisy and some hope for change. It is likely to be a long fight, however, because opposition to women\u2019s schooling comes from the very top of the Taliban movement. Several Afghans with knowledge of the Taliban leadership, both inside and outside the movement, described the decision to bar girls from school as coming straight from the supreme leader, Haibatullah Akhundzada, and his inner circle. Haibatullah, or his close allies, ordered one of the cruellest moments of the last year, they said, when high school girls who had been summoned in March to restart class were ordered home again soon after turning up for the first day of classes.  \u201cThis is the stance of a minority, who are in a very strong position,\u201d said one well-connected Afghan source. Diplomats and Afghans with leadership ties said the ministry of education had been genuinely planning to get girls back into schools, with preparations including checks that facilities met Taliban standards for segregated classes. The ministry was blindsided by the last-minute ruling from Kandahar, where Haibatullah is based. \u201cTwo eminent [figures in the movement] said \u2018the Taliban have been taken hostage\u2019,\u201d the Afghan source with leadership ties said. He described a gathering of thousands of clerics, organised last month, as an attempt by other frustrated Taliban factions to out-maneouvre the leadership and claim legitimacy for girls\u2019 education. That plan was thwarted when Haibatullah came to Kabul for the first time, to address the meeting, in a speech that pointedly side-stepped the question of girls\u2019 education. Despite taboos on criticising the leadership, after decades of emphasising unity on the battlefield, a handful of senior Taliban figures have spoken out against the ban. In May the deputy foreign minister, Sher Mohammad Abbas Stanikzai, directly attacked the prohibition of girls\u2019 education in a televised speech defending the rights of \u201chalf the population of Afghanistan\u201d. Taliban cleric Rahimullah Haqqani, who was killed last week by an Islamic State suicide bomber, had previously told the BBC that Afghan women and girls should be able to access education: \u201cThere is no justification in the sharia [law] to say female education is not allowed. No justification at all. \u201cAll the religious books have stated female education is permissible and obligatory, because, for example, if a woman gets sick, in an Islamic environment like Afghanistan or Pakistan, and needs treatment, it\u2019s much better if she\u2019s treated by a female doctor.\u201d  In June the central government launched a bloody response to an uprising by a rebel Taliban commander in Balkhab district, in northern Sar-e-pol province. The conflict had complex roots, but sources told the Observer that before leader Mawlawi Mehdi lost his government job, he too had defended girls\u2019 education. And because the ban is officially only temporary, and the Taliban has always said it supports the principle of women\u2019s right to education, some officials with younger daughters are willing to be open about their own attitude towards schooling. Maulawi Ahmed Taqi, a spokesperson for the ministry of higher education, highlighted efforts to adapt universities so women could study while meeting Taliban requirements for strict gender segregation, as a sign of the group\u2019s commitment to women\u2019s education. \u201cI have daughters and of course I want my girls to be educated in religious madrassas as well as getting a modern education,\u201d he said. They are currently in primary school, but he is confident they will be able to continue classes as they get older, he added. \u201cI am optimistic the schools won\u2019t be closed for ever\u201d"

                    "body": "Care workers recruited from overseas to look after elderly and disabled people in Britain are being charged thousands of pounds in illegal fees and forced to work in exploitative conditions to pay off their debts. An Observer investigation has uncovered a network of agencies supplying workers to care homes and homecare agencies that charge recruitment fees to candidates. By law, agents cannot charge a fee for finding or trying to find a candidate work. The practice of charging recruitment fees, previously exposed in the UAE and Qatar, is considered a human rights abuse that leaves workers vulnerable to exploitation.  But the fees are often disguised as a \u201cprocessing\u201d, \u201cservice\u201d or \u201cadmin\u201d charge, with many workers unaware they are illegal. Often, the breakdown of fees or full amount is not fully disclosed until the worker has reached the UK, by which time they have already paid for flights and relocation. Workers from India, the Philippines, Ghana and Zimbabwe are among those charged for their recruitment, with fees ranging from \u00a33,000 to \u00a318,000. Some have become trapped in debt bondage \u2013 a form of modern slavery \u2013 as a result of the fees. Suspected victims described how agents had deducted money from their salaries and withheld their passport or residence permit until they repaid the sum owed. Others claim to have been subject to abuse and threats or paid less than the minimum wage. They cannot speak up because the sponsorship system for care workers means their visa is tied to their employer.  The findings come as Britain battles a worsening social care staffing crisis, with an estimated 105,000 vacancies nationally and thousands of patients facing long delays for care. Many of the care workers used a government visa scheme introduced in February which added care workers to the shortage occupation list to attract international candidates. But evidence collected by the Observer \u2013 including interviews with suspected victims, charities and labour experts; conversations with agents; and analysis of payslips, contracts and online chat groups \u2013 reveals the new visa route is being widely abused by agencies and traffickers, leaving workers open to exploitation. In one exchange with an undercover reporter last week, an agency supplying Indian workers to care homes said the fee for candidates for arranging a \u00a310-an-hour job would be 1.7m rupees, about \u00a317,600. Another quoted \u00a34,500 for a \u201cplacement package\u201d including a certificate of sponsorship, a cost normally borne by the employer, and \u201cvisa application support\u201d \u2013 something only lawyers and registered immigration advisers can legally charge for.  Todd Maforimbo, who studied the supply of labour into the UK health sector and now campaigns on labour abuse, said he had been contacted by more than 30 care workers charged fees. \u201cPeople are coming to look for a better life but they\u2019re ending up in worse situations,\u201d he said. Modern slavery in the care sector is a growing problem, with several raids by the government\u2019s labour abuse agency recently, and data from charities and the Care Quality Commission suggesting a rise in cases. In one case in north Wales, nine Indian workers were found sleeping on mattresses in cramped and unsanitary conditions. Colleagues at the care homes where they were working reported them turning up \u201ctired and smelling\u201d and saw them eating leftovers from residents\u2019 meals. The workers, who came to Britain as students, are believed to have worked up to 80 hours a week for minimum wage, with their pay controlled by their alleged exploiters. An internal report from the Gangmasters and Labour Abuse Authority, seen by the Observer, said more monitoring was needed by care homes as well as universities to \u201cprevent debt bondage and highlight potential traffickers\u201d. The Department of Health said it took reports of illegal employment practices in the sector \u201cvery seriously\u201d, and that agencies or employers found operating unlawfully could face prosecution. It added that providers must comply with ethical standards laid out in its code of practice for international recruitment, which bans recruitment fees and says any costs incurred by agencies must be charged to employers."

                    "body": "Jamie Forsstroem is excited. Tomorrow they make their debut flight with Virgin Atlantic as part of the cabin crew on a plane to San Francisco. Forsstroem will be wearing a burgundy trouser suit designed by Vivienne Westwood, with their pronouns \u2013 \u201cThey/them\u201d \u2013 on a badge pinned to the lapel. Forsstroem comes from Finland, a country where gendered pronouns don\u2019t exist in the language. \u201cI\u2019ve learned English since I was nine years old, so I\u2019ve always known about them, but in terms of using them to define my own gender identity, I was quite late to the game,\u201d they say. It wasn\u2019t until Forsstroem moved to London six years ago in their mid\u201120s, and started to work exclusively in English, that they decided to make the change and honour a non-binary identity that they have been clear about since early childhood. In September, Virgin Atlantic became the latest company to throw itself into a quiet revolution sweeping through the institutional world. You could call it the great corporate pronoun push. The airline\u2019s announcement that from now on it would be possible not only for staff, but for customers to travel under the gender of their choice caused little media furore but a big run on their rather elegant pronoun badges. Within a month, the 10,000 they had printed out for distribution on planes and in their travel shops had been snapped up. A second batch is currently on order. It was all very different from the fuss that erupted this time last year when Marks &amp; Spencer, that bastion of no-nonsense British values, announced that it was giving staff the option of adding personal pronouns to their name badges. A couple of months later the story had rolled on to the British Library, with reports that the library had ignored internal warnings that a similar initiative could make it seem too \u201cwoke\u201d. In the event, more than 100 British Library staff took up the option of pronoun badges after their scheme launched. In the case of Virgin Atlantic and the British Library, the badges are optional. Some firms \u2013 such as the energy company Ovo \u2013 have taken a more proactive line, prompting colleagues to include pronouns when introducing themselves at meetings, and introducing a signoff on emails that allows employees to choose their own combination. \u201cIt might be she/them. They could leave it blank if they choose, but I\u2019ve not come across anyone who\u2019s done that. We encourage everyone to use and share their pronouns,\u201d says Louise Bailey, who is responsible for the company\u2019s inclusion and diversity policy.  While some see such initiatives as a victory in the fight for gender recognition, others roll their eyes at the onward march of \u201cwokeness\u201d. A third group decry the corporatisation of personal identity, and warn about the accompanying pressures to conform. In June, it was the turn of the Halifax bank to unleash a social media storm. Their first offence was to tweet \u201cPronouns matter. #ItsAPeopleThing\u201d below a photo of a staff member wearing a name tag \u201cGemma\u201d followed by \u201cshe/her/hers\u201d (grammarians generally add the possessive to pronoun groups, though most badges use only two). Their second was to double down on their message, replying to one critic: \u201cWe strive for inclusion, equality and, quite simply, in doing what\u2019s right. If you disagree with our values, you\u2019re welcome to close your account.\u201d * * * As a writer, reader and feminist who is also the parent of a transgender child, I come at this subject from several directions. Like many journalists, I\u2019ve struggled to wrestle the singular pronouns \u201cthey/them\u201d into a sentence. As a mother, I sometimes feel like an explorer who has wandered off the edge of the map. The leg from \u201cher\u201d to \u201chim\u201d lost me some longstanding feminist friends, who have found the whole subject too hard to broach face to face, but was otherwise relatively straightforward. My \u201cshe\u201d was now \u201che\u201d: those hard, binary pronouns signalled an altered reality and gave me the chance to avoid the subject if I didn\u2019t want to explain it to everyone I met at the bus stop who wasn\u2019t familiar with my family setup. The next leg, to \u201cthey/them\u201d, was more exposing, and I still sometimes find myself floundering. Just look at the complexities of that bus stop conversation: in order to avoid using either their birth name or \u201cher\u201d \u2013 both legally obsolete \u2013 or \u201chim\u201d \u2013 which is sometimes chronologically inaccurate, given that \u201che\u201d may have been \u201cshe\u201d at the time that we\u2019re talking about \u2013 I fall back on \u201cmy child\u201d to refer to someone who is now 29 years old. Using \u201cthey\u201d smooths the whole thing out. My child is relaxed about being addressed as he or they, and the construction \u201cas-was\u201d has evolved as a handy and respectful hinge for me in conversations with friends about their childhood: \u201cR, as-was, always liked her hair long; C didn\u2019t for a while when he was transitioning, but now they do again.\u201d It\u2019s a DIY fix that I\u2019ve stumbled upon, to honour a complex history in a close network of family and friends, though I\u2019m well aware that many trans people reject any reference to their previous gender identity. Why does this matter? Because personal pronouns not only give people a sense of their place in the world but also, in the English language at least, have for centuries been used to keep them in their place, socially and politically. This is why feelings run so high. It\u2019s not an issue that divides neatly along traditional left/right lines, so how are well-meaning people supposed to navigate this confusing new world? Should we all be declaring our preferred pronouns? When does doing so become virtue signalling \u2013 or even a coded attack on those who reject the idea of gender, as they are legally entitled to do? * * * Though the rows that break out over pronouns might seem like a big rupture over the rights of a small group of people, for activists on both sides they trigger a deeply personal sense of oppression and injury. \u201cThe frontline now is trans rights,\u201d said the singer-songwriter Billy Bragg after he was challenged for changing the lyrics of his song Sexuality from \u201cAnd just because you\u2019re gay / I won\u2019t turn you away\u201d to \u201cAnd just because you\u2019re they / I won\u2019t turn you away\u201d. Sexuality was released in 1991, when the gay community was being persecuted in the UK on the streets and in the courts. Aids was known as \u201cthe gay plague\u201d and section 28, introduced three years earlier, had prohibited the \u201cpromotion of homosexuality\u201d by local authorities, which was intended to mean that no child could learn about it at school. But times have changed, Bragg wrote on Twitter. \u201cAnyone born since the song was released would wonder why it\u2019s a big deal to find common ground with a gay man.\u201d \u201cI was trying to get my rather blokey audiences to think about it,\u201d Bragg tells me. \u201cI met my first out gay people through Rock Against Racism in the 1980s, when Tom Robinson and the Clash were on the bill, and I often wonder how I\u2019d have reacted if I\u2019d just been down the pub with my mates,\u201d he says. \u201cMusic can make a difference like that. I\u2019m not saying a couple of lyrics will do a lot, but my audiences can be rather sentimental about the 1980s as a time when the issues were clear, and I\u2019m constantly trying to challenge this. That isn\u2019t to say it\u2019s not immensely complicated \u2013 it is \u2013 but you can\u2019t shy away from it.\u201d Bragg introduced the new lyrics in 2019, but they didn\u2019t hit the headlines until he linked the song to Stonewall\u2019s Diversity Champions campaign. This encourages firms to sign up to a set of protocols showing solidarity with trans people through measures such as name badges and encouraging staff to adopt personal pronouns on email signoffs: the addition of, say, \u201cshe/her\u201d or \u201cthey/them\u201d between name and title. Stonewall\u2019s campaign has become a flashpoint for those who regard personal pronouns as part of a bigger issue about the distinction between sex, which is based on biology, and gender, which is socially constructed. Though more than 900 firms are still signed up, Diversity Champions has suffered a slew of resignations over the last couple of years, including a succession of government departments and the BBC, which ruled in November 2021 that membership compromised its duty of impartiality in the reporting of transgender issues.  Comedian turned business consultant Simon Fanshawe, a founder of Stonewall who is now one of its critics, picks this up in his latest book, The Power of Difference, suggesting that \u201cthe idea of \u2018preferred pronouns\u2019 flows directly not from a desire to be \u2018nice\u2019 to trans people, as it\u2019s so often characterised, but from a theoretical and campaigning perspective that everyone has an \u2018innate gender\u2019 and therefore there is a need to state your pronouns as separate from your physical sex. This is not widely accepted. In fact, it is highly controversial.\u201d The irony, Fanshawe adds, \u201cis that the progressive thinking and actions that have supported diversity and inclusion at work have now become tools of conformity, with HR acting as the enforcer and managers and staff walking on eggshells, frightened about being penalised for saying the \u2018wrong thing\u2019.\u201d * * * Within the family, especially where young children are involved, pronouns can be a deeply painful subject, with both sides feeling they are being denied a voice. Sam (not his real name) speaks for many, as the father of a 13-year-old who has adopted the pronouns they/them. \u201cMilly resents me enormously as someone they suspect doesn\u2019t \u2018get it\u2019. They are wonderfully fierce and clear, but those words are emerging from the mouth of a neurodivergent 13-year-old. Intellectually, I think there are likely to be many things at play and so I resist, for myself, just accepting that Milly\u2019s claimed gender identity is a biological fact when I suspect it is evolving and certainly not yet fixed and final.\u201d Sam is bisexual and his devotion to his child is not in question. He knows how important it is for Milly to feel safe and accepted at home, and dutifully puts 20p into a \u201cnaughty jar\u201d every time he accidentally misgenders them. But he worries about articulating his doubts. \u201cI know that many prominent people have suffered enormously from expressing any such thoughts,\u201d he says. \u201cWhere is the space where one can wonder aloud what is going on that isn\u2019t an expunging of identity?\u201d As a reader, in such situations, I tend to look to great writers for help. \u201cTheir change of sex, though it altered their future, did nothing whatever to alter their identity,\u201d wrote Virginia Woolf of her gender change aristocrat Orlando, as he morphs into a woman, \u201c\u2026 but in future we must, for convention\u2019s sake, say \u2018her\u2019 for \u2018his\u2019 and \u2018she\u2019 for \u2018he\u2019.\u201d What if Lewis Carroll had written this in the first chapter of Alice\u2019s Adventures in Wonderland: \u201cAlice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by their sister on the bank, and of having nothing to do. Once or twice they had peeped into the book their sister was reading, but it had no pictures or conversations in it, \u2018and what is the use of a book\u2019, thought Alice, \u2018without pictures or conversation?\u2019\u201d The Rev Charles Dodgson, AKA Lewis Carroll, wouldn\u2019t have recognised the concept of \u201cwoke\u201d unless it involved Lazarus or a choir of angels on judgment day, but he would merely have been following Jane Austen, Charles Dickens \u2013 or the translator of a French poem, William and the Werewolf, in 1375 (the earliest example of the singular \u201cthey\u201d in the Oxford English Dictionary). I take comfort from the fact that the chapter of Alice was titled \u201cdown the rabbit-hole\u201d, because that is where the pronoun debate takes us all, and it\u2019s indeed a place devoid of pictures or (sensible) conversation. To make sense of it I have to burrow further underground, into history and politics, psychology and linguistics. To return to basics, what exactly are pronouns and why are they so contentious? The Oxford linguistics professor Deborah Cameron tells me that in classic linguistic grammatical theory, they are simply placeholders \u2013 \u201ca piece of language that allows you to retrieve something that hasn\u2019t been said or that has previously been said, or that will be said\u201d. In other words, they\u2019re a shorthand that prevents the need to refer to people by name again and again. Old English used variations of the same word \u2013 \u201che\u201d and \u201cheo\u201d for \u201che\u201d and \u201cshe\u201d, and \u201chi\u201d for third-person plurals of all genders. But in day-to-day life these could be confusing. When Viking settlers brought the old Norse \u201cthey/them\u201d with them to the north-east of England, it offered a handy solution, and gradually spread across the country. Over the centuries both second- and third-person pronouns became a marker of power and social status. The second-person \u201cyou\u201d became superior to \u201cthou\u201d (as \u201cvous\u201d is to \u201ctu\u201d in French) \u2013 a distinction that, Cameron says, disappeared in standard English only with the growth of cities in the 15th and 16th centuries, because of the risk of committing a faux pas by misreading the status of someone you had only just met.  Meanwhile, in legal documents and definitions, a patriarchal establishment seized on \u201che/him\u201d as the third-person default \u2013 ostensibly for convenience, but also as a way of keeping women in their place \u2013 with the result, Cameron says, that pronouns have been a battleground for English-speaking feminists since the earliest organised campaigns for women\u2019s legal and civil rights. The Reform Act of 1832 transformed the rights of men, but excluded women by limiting the definition of universal suffrage \u2013 the right to vote \u2013 to \u201cevery male person of full age\u201d. In 1851, in partnership with his new suffragist wife, Harriet Taylor Mill, the English philosopher and MP John Stuart Mill neutralised the language in his most influential books, replacing \u201cmen\u201d and \u201cmankind\u201d with \u201cperson\u201d and \u201cpeople\u201d, and complaining in a footnote that \u201cthe pronoun he is the only one available to express all human beings \u2026 This is more than a defect in language, tending greatly to prolong the almost universal habit of thinking and speaking of one half of the human species as the whole.\u201d The history of oppression by pronoun is wittily investigated by the linguistics professor Dennis Baron in his book What\u2019s Your Pronoun?. He quotes an American newspaper correspondent who declared in 1892 that there was a word missing from the English language. \u201cWhat is wanted is a personal pronoun, common gender; the singular of they \u2026 The person that invents a word to fill the vacancy will receive the benediction of other nations as well as this.\u201d In fact, many alternatives had already been invented. Baron lists 200 of them from newspapers and dictionaries on both sides of the Atlantic, ranging from \u201cou\u201d (suggested by the Scottish philosopher James Anderson in 1792) to \u201cve\u201d, \u201cvis\u201d and \u201cvim\u201d, which were proposed in 1864 by an American periodical, The Ladies\u2019 Repository, as a unisex pronoun that would ensure \u201cprecision, perspicuity and brevity \u2026 in this age of improvement\u201d. * * * In 1932 the Guardian made its own contribution, when it awarded second prize of a guinea to Arthur L Dakyns, of Didsbury in Manchester, in a competition to suggest the 10 most needed additions to the English vocabulary. His offer included three \u201cpersonal pronouns of indefinite gender\u201d: ha, ham and shas. Dakyns\u2019s list also included \u201cBronk: to raise and lower one eyebrow while keeping the other steady (indispensable to actors aspiring to film work)\u201d, suggesting he was not perhaps being entirely serious. The tone of his entry is instantly recognisable. It\u2019s mockery dressed up as wit \u2013 the ancestor of the \u201cI sexually identify as an attack helicopter\u201d meme that emerged on Reddit in 2014 and has since multiplied across the internet. Despite centuries of ridicule, however, the search for gender-neutral pronouns continues. A recent children\u2019s picture book, out in the US and the UK, lists 14 different alternatives, including ey/em/eir, fae/fae/faers and xe/xem/xyr. \u201cThey can seem confusing at first,\u201d chirrups The Pronoun Book, beside a colourful picture bubble of a bemused-looking child with unruly curls, \u201cbut you use them just like you would any other pronoun. For example, \u2018Xe brushed xyr hair\u2019.\u201d The problem with this \u2013 and the reason that so many suggestions have failed to catch on \u2013 is that a pronoun is only a pronoun if it comes from a limited set. If everyone is free to adopt one that is not part of a socially agreed range, you might as well use their name again. \u201cAs xe said to em\u201d wouldn\u2019t work in a university seminar. None of the three groups I\u2019ve cited from The Pronoun Book exist in the Oxford English Dictionary. That\u2019s not surprising, given that words usually have to be in circulation for 10 years before they\u2019re considered, but neither does it necessarily mean that none will ever be included, says senior editor Jonathan Dent. The OED updated what Dent calls \u201cth- pronouns\u201d in October 2019, to include the use of \u201cThey: them\u201d for \u201csomeone whose sense of personal identity does not correspond to conventional sex and gender distinctions\u201d. But he points out that language is constantly evolving, and the OED only updated the entry for \u201cpronoun\u201d itself in September 2021 to cover \u201cspecific use of third-person pronouns to reflect gender identity\u201d. The Pronoun Book is aimed at readers aged five and over. \u201cSome people ask if children of that age need to know about this stuff, but children themselves don\u2019t have a problem with it and there\u2019s a huge demand for this sort of book, from schools and from LGBTQ+ families,\u201d says its British editor Andrew James, who bought it as an unsolicited submission from American author Cassandra Jules Corrigan. The book\u2019s assumption that children should be free to make up their own minds is supported by Claudia, a consultant clinical psychologist specialising in young people with gender dysphoria, who says: \u201cMisgendering young people with an intense trans- or cross-gender identification can cause them pain and sometimes results in them not even recognising themselves. Language is a social construction which brings things into being, and pronouns are a part of that.\u201d Sam has experience of this with Milly. \u201cThey find it physically painful when I get their pronoun wrong,\u201d he says. Terri Apter, a Cambridge sociology professor whose research specialism is family dynamics, identity and relationships, believes an evolving acceptance of they/them may play a part in addressing this problem. \u201cI had a grammarian\u2019s bias that \u2018thou should not use they as a singular\u2019,\u201d she admits. But that changed when she started work on her latest book, The Teen Interpreter, and she realised how freeing it could be as a way of avoiding gender stereotypes, and how much neater it was than her previous strategy of alternating he and she. This isn\u2019t just an issue of literary convenience, Apter says. She believes a wider adoption of they/them might even allow some children and adolescents to explore and resolve their confusions around gender without rushing into potentially life-changing decisions. \u201cThe problem is that, at the moment, a request to be addressed as \u2018they\u2019 is sometimes used to mark exceptional status; to say, \u2018Look at me, I need special treatment.\u2019 But it\u2019s so useful to have a non-gendered third-person pronoun, because there are some people who feel acutely \u2018not me\u2019 when addressed as he or she.\u201d In April this year, the US became the 17th country in the world to introduce gender-neutral passports, offering the option of \u201cX\u201d alongside \u201cM\u201d (male) and \u201cF\u201d (female). We live in a globalised world where many languages, such as Finnish, don\u2019t have gendered personal pronouns; there\u2019s no one size that fits all. The Dutch author Marieke Lucas Rijneveld first started to explore pronouns on being shortlisted for the International Booker prize. \u201cI had an interview with The New York Times and was asked what I wanted to be called. I remember being a little surprised. I hadn\u2019t actually thought about my pronouns and it hadn\u2019t occurred to me that I had a choice. In Dutch interviews, you are rarely asked,\u201d says Rijneveld, who went on to win the prize. \u201cBut when I started doing more interviews abroad, people often asked me, and since a good neutral solution already existed in English \u2013 they/them \u2013 I chose that.\u201d Soon Rijneveld began to feel that this didn\u2019t represent the true picture. \u201cI\u2019m being billed as non-binary everywhere, but actually it is becoming increasingly clear to me: I feel like a boy. Not a man or a woman or non-binary, but a boy.\u201d Finally, one night earlier this year, Rijneveld made a decision: \u201cFor the past year I\u2019ve been digging into myself like a vole and looking for what I am. I don\u2019t have a definite answer to that yet, but that night I decided to change my pronouns in my biography to he/him. And it felt wonderful!\u201d  There are many reasons why people might not want to declare their gender. Claudia, the child psychologist, is non-binary and uses they/them pronouns, but doesn\u2019t mention them to the families they work with, \u201cbecause I work in such a sensitive area, where I wish to maintain some manoeuvrability in my clinical interactions\u201d. Alex, who identifies as they/them, was working early and late shifts at a Tesco store in Scotland when the supermarket rolled out pronoun badges in November 2020, and decided against wearing one. \u201cI thought: that\u2019s cool, but it would take away the choice to disclose my pronouns, and I\u2019m aware that there have been homophobic attacks in my area. It would probably be fine in the store, but what would happen if I bumped into a homophobe who recognised me on the way home?\u201d Jane, a university professor, was delighted when her doctorate meant she no longer had to signal her gender. \u201cIn conversations with the carpet-fitter on the phone, it\u2019s a huge relief to be able to say, \u2018I\u2019m not Miss or Mrs. I\u2019m Dr, actually.\u2019 It\u2019s something men don\u2019t have to deal with.\u201d But it\u2019s quite another matter to deny other people the right to their preferred pronouns. Kate, whose child uses they/them pronouns, is outraged by friends who refuse to use \u201cthey\u201d. \u201cMates of a certain age all think they are being so valid when they say, \u2018I can\u2019t do it \u2013 it\u2019s plural! It just doesn\u2019t make sense to me.\u2019 It pisses me off totally. It\u2019s lazy. Yes, I found it a little tricky at first, but it\u2019s become completely natural. It\u2019s how my child and their friends feel most themselves. The only respectful thing I can do is to get my head around it.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s a sense in which dead-naming and misgendering me is trivial,\u201d says the trans writer Roz Kaveney, \u201cbut it\u2019s also a very economical way of erasing and sneering about everything I\u2019ve done as an artist, critic and human rights activist in the four decades since I transitioned.\u201d * * * There is no doubt that social media has played a key part in the firestorm. Since announcing his revised pronouns on Twitter, Rijneveld says: \u201cI received a tremendous amount of good messages, but also a lot of misunderstanding and hate reactions.\u201d Yet Aoife Martin, an online columnist and IT professional who works in Dublin and lives in a small town near the Irish border, has had no problems since transitioning four years ago. \u201cMy pronouns came with me. My employers and my landlord have been very supportive,\u201d she says. At PwC, an accountancy firm that has diversified into a wide range of services, the option to display gender pronouns makes business sense. \u201cWe\u2019re a professional services firm, so all we have is our people: we sell their brains and expertise to our clients, and that expertise doesn\u2019t come in a standard form,\u201d says Sarah Churchman, chief inclusion, community and wellbeing officer. \u201cYour average person working in cybersecurity isn\u2019t the same as the person in audit. Ten years ago, it was a big thing not to wear suits all year round. Now, we have people in shorts. We\u2019re a global business and 22% of our staff are generation Z, so we want to reflect their values. Pronouns are part of that.\u201d Martin Smith, one of the firm\u2019s directors, offers his own story as an example of their value. As a young gay man, he says, he found himself running multiple lives. \u201cI had a gay life, a university friends life, a home friends life, a work life, and I didn\u2019t know how to join it all together. It was exhausting,\u201d he says. \u201cWhat I\u2019d like to do is to make things better for people who are a bit like us 15 years ago. It\u2019s all about respect among a group of people who want each other to thrive and succeed.\u201d  In my own lifetime, identity conventions have changed radically and for the better. My father was appalled in 1983 when I breached the Mrs/Miss binary by designating myself Ms on getting married. Yet it was a statement of self-belief that has helped me to negotiate the complexities of life as a working mother, and it\u2019s an option on every official form today. One of my school friends, who recently adopted they/them pronouns, wonders how different their life would have been if the option had existed when they were young. Angie McLachlan, who is now a bishop in a church that ministers to the LGBTQ+ community, was a tomboy at school and had crushes on girls as a teenager, but says: \u201cThere was no way to talk about being gay. The only way to express those feelings was by refusing to wear girls\u2019 clothes, so all through school I wore jeans.\u201d They had been married for several years before coming out as lesbian and falling in love with the woman who is now their wife, with whom they live in the south-west of England. It was only after they had a hysterectomy in their late 50s that they finally understood that they were non-binary, and changed their pronouns. \u201cI was very lost for a long time,\u201d they say. \u201cIt feels like coming home.\u201d McLachlan\u2019s story is one of personal growth and self-respect, which they carry with them into the institution in which they work, rather than the institution pushing it on them. They were out there, alongside the veteran gay rights activist Peter Tatchell, shimmering in their episcopal purple, at a demonstration this spring against conversion practices for trans people. Pronouns are just a grammatical convenience, which has been pushed and shoved around by accidents of history and geography, but they are also so much more than that. Forsstroem will wear their burgundy suit and badge only on flights to destinations where it is safe to do so. The fact that these do not include Qatar, host of the football World Cup, is a reminder that there are many places in the world where it is still dangerous to be gender non\u2011conforming. If declaring one\u2019s pronouns, and accepting that \u201cthey/them\u201d doesn\u2019t ruin a sentence, can help to raise awareness and enable an embattled minority to live happier lives, then bring them on.  \u2022 This article was amended on 26 November 2022 to correct a misspelling of Jamie Forsstroem\u2019s surname, introduced during editing."

That\u2019s a maxim that might be wiring back and forth through Ger\u00f3nimo Rulli\u2019s stunned noggin after he got up in Mohamed Salah\u2019s grille last night, accusing the weak link in Liverpool\u2019s attack of clanking him upside the head, even though it was his own teammate\u2019s fault. Having given it the big one, it was probably then incumbent on the Villarreal keeper to make a couple of similarly sized saves to help his team to the Paris final of Coupe de Grande in three weeks\u2019 time. But he didn\u2019t, letting efforts by Fabinho and Luis D\u00edaz go straight through the holes in his cartoon-hunk-of-cheese-influenced body, then with Sadio Man\u00e9 in close attendance, deciding to nip off for the paper. Let\u2019s hope he didn\u2019t pick up a copy of L\u2019Equipe, he\u2019ll not like those player ratings one bit.  That was supposed to be the uneventful tie, too. Should tonight\u2019s reprise between Real Madrid and Manchester City take a similar leap forward in terms of drama and entertainment, it\u2019s going to end 11-10 after extra time, and that\u2019s before we get to penalties. The Fiver ventures to suggest that City are the superior side, but they should have been four up after 20 minutes of the first leg, and now look. So who knows? Real will surely feel less nervous at the Bernab\u00e9u. The home crowd will have their back; they got away with one last week; and the domestic title is already safely tucked away in their back pocket \u2013 a prize that saw Carlo Ancelotti become the first manager to complete the sextuplet of league titles in Spain, Italy, Germany, France and England plus not making a show of himself at Everton, the latter perhaps the most astonishing achievement of all. Ancelotti is also hoping to become the first manager to win Big Cup four times, surpassing the achievements of Bob Paisley and Zinedine Zidane. His opposite number tonight would simply like to join the triumvirate on three wins, a total he\u2019d surely already have breezed past were it not for his tendency to overthink things. \u201cWe have to be better but at the same time we could play much worse and win and nobody can deny my assessment is right,\u201d Pep Guardiola riddles-me-this. \u201cThere are moments when you train really badly before the game and then put in an exceptional performance, or you train really well and the guys do badly. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen. The selection will be to try to win the game.\u201d Those last 10 words hang heavy. Oh dear. It\u2019s possible to understand his point exactly, and yet also worry the poor chap is unnecessarily tying himself up in knots once again. Like we say, The Fiver is fairly convinced City are the better team. But we\u2019ll need the teamsheets to land before we can be absolutely sure.

                    "body": "It seemed fitting that Manchester City should come storming back from the brink the way they did, Ilkay G\u00fcndogan soaring like a small, technically adept avenging phoenix to bullet his header very carefully into the top corner of the Aston Villa net. This is how they do this stuff around here. Not with more heat, more blood, more chaos; but with cleaner lines, greater clarity, a red mist of extreme precision.\nWithin six minutes of that opening act Pep Guardiola\u2019s champions had completed the most beautifully orderly emergency comeback in English footballing history. And there is something genuinely fearless about being able to play football this way, to become more not less yourself when the pulse is pounding, time running short, the world closing in at your back.\n\nIt was fitting too that G\u00fcndogan, Guardiola\u2019s first signing at City, should score the title-winning goal, his second of the game: and that Raheem Sterling and Kevin De Bruyne should be present pulling the strings, both of whom have been present for Guardiola\u2019s entire span in England.\nAt the end of which, and for all the fine margins, this is the most definitive of title wins. City scored more goals, made more passes and had more possession than any other team in Europe\u2019s top five leagues this season.\nJo\u00e3o Cancelo, Rodri and Aymeric Laporte made more passes than anyone else in the English top tier (Cancelo, an all-purpose influence, was also top 10 for tackles, dribbles and interceptions and 12th on shots at goal).\nIt has been a kind of total football, the domination of every metric, a sky blue wash applied across every surface of elite English football. At the end of which, this is also a good moment to take a breath. There is no suggestion Guardiola intends to leave when his contract expires next year, but some things will change now. Key players in this group are reaching their peak. Some will leave in the summer. Erling Haaland\u2019s arrival suggests a different kind of rebuild in the offing.\n\nAnd, looking back, the first six years of Guardiola at City have their own very distinct tone and texture. Zoom out a little to take in tactics, structure and ownership model, right down to the way full-blown internet tribalism has become an aspect of football fandom, and there is a fair case that Pep-era Manchester City is the single most transformative element in the modern history of English football.\nTwo things seem clear enough. First, this has been a dizzying success. Four titles in six years: even taking out the Premier League premium that says the thing that has just happened is the only thing that has ever happened, this is one of the great title-winning eras in English football history.\nOn the pure numbers Guardiola is now level with Kenny Dalglish and Herbert Chapman, one behind Matt Busby, two behind Bob Paisley, and, like everyone else, way back on Alex Ferguson\u2019s 27-year total of 13.\nFactor in the shortness of his span and the sheer intensity of his influence and Guardiola starts to look like something even more substantial. He is now part of a tiny group \u2013 Chapman, Busby, Bill Shankly and Ars\u00e8ne Wenger spring to mind \u2013 whose success has also changed the way football is played, coached and understood in this country.\n\nThat tactical influence is the most obvious part of the Pep supremacy. In his time English football has tilted dramatically towards the possession style, the primacy of technique, the Catalan-Dutch obsession with the ball that is embodied best by Guardiola\u2019s own evolving team.\nIn the simplest terms, the season before he arrived City scored 71 goals and passed the ball 20,488 times. In the title-winning season just gone they scored 99 goals and made 26,132 passes.\nIt is easy to take for granted the influence exerted over that time. Inverted wingers, false 9s, full-backs that wander, goalkeepers who love the ball: Pep has been the single biggest driver in these elements becoming part of English football\u2019s internal language, to the extent even entry-level English managers will talk about their \u201cphilosophy\u201d (love of knowledge) and accept the idea of coaching as a course of study, an intellectual discipline.\n\nScroll back and it seems comical that as recently as 2016 there was still a small island hostility to this unproven (two Champions Leagues) outsider. The press conference at the King Power Stadium after a 4-2 defeat by Leicester City in December 2016, when Guardiola asked \u201cwhat is tackles?\u201d, has by now passed into low-key legend; a footballing version of the Sex Pistols playing Lesser Free Trade Hall in June 1976, a pistol-shot-to-wake-the-world kind of affair.\nAt the time there was a degree of mockery. Fast forward five and a half years and it is remarkable to see the influence constant exposure to the Guardiola style has had. From a national team defined through its 140-year history by direct play and physicality, but now reconfigured to fetishise possession and patience; right down to the rhythms of park football, where the local under-11s will play an orderly passing game, where parents shout about pressing and not sending it long, where short passes are performatively applauded.\nMuch of this was already in train pre-Guardiola, but his presence has supercharged it. He was right too. City made 300 fewer tackles this season than the year before he arrived, when they finished fourth behind Arsenal and Spurs.\n\nThere are of course other sides to this transformation. City\u2019s nation-state ownership is 14 years old now. Nobody was prepared for the changes wrought by this entirely different model, this entirely different set of motivations. In many ways it is simply the real world intruding. English culture, trade, economics, even the language has always been a magpie-ish thing, a business of export/import, borrowed talent, borrowed influences.\nThis has been dramatically accelerated by globalisation. Qatar owns the tallest building in England. Abu Dhabi owns Manchester City. The project is in its own way a modern economic marvel: new spaces, new ground, new team, new style, new gravity.\nBut it does also deserve to be judged as something more than a set of buildings and a payroll. The sporting infrastructure is delicate. And while plenty of other teams have tried to spend their way to success over the same period, City\u2019s superpower has been to set about elite level sport with the coherence of an overt political project, backed by bottomless reserves, extreme executive competence and a willingness to litigate.\n\nIn many ways their success can look mundane from the outside: hire the best talent, spend the most money, remove the standard desperation of feuding egos, lust for glory, nepotism, incompetence.\nIt is a part of Guardiola\u2019s brilliance, his edge and his occasionally self-destructive obsession that under his hand this project has remained both beautiful and something that still feels like sport.\nCity are exceptional title winners for so many reasons. Most obviously because they ended up with one more point than a brilliant Liverpool team. But this has also been their era, in the most far-reaching sense."

                    "body": "Good morning. One week after Dom Phillips and Bruno Pereira went missing in the Amazon, the Brazilian embassy in London told Phillips\u2019 family that two bodies had been found yesterday, and president Jair Bolsonaro said \u201csomething wicked\u201d had been done to them \u2013 only to be apparently contradicted by the police. But there appeared little reason for optimism. There has been alarm over the fate of Phillips, a British journalist who was a frequent contributor to the Guardian, and Pereira, a respected advocate for the rights of Brazil\u2019s Indigenous peoples, since their disappearance. What hopes there were for their safe return have faded in recent days. Monday\u2019s wrenching developments came two days after items belonging to the men were found in the Javari region, where Pereira was acting as a guide on a reporting trip for Phillips\u2019 book.  As their loved ones face the extension of their wait for certainty about the men\u2019s fate, today\u2019s newsletter sets out what we know about the circumstances of their disappearance, what it tells us about Jair Bolsonaro\u2019s Brazil, and what enduring value there is in the work of both men. First, here are the rest of the headlines. Five big stories  Brexit | The EU is set to launch legal action against the UK after ministers claimed a loophole allowed them to scrap post-Brexit checks in Northern Ireland. The UK admitted it would not meet its international legal obligations but said it was relying on a principle called the \u201cdoctrine of necessity\u201d. Immigration and asylum | The first flight to deport refugees to Rwanda moved a step closer on Monday after judges rejected two last-ditch legal challenges. But after successful individual challenges fewer than 10 people are now due to be removed on the flight, raising the possibility that it will be cancelled. Economy | Fears of recession have pounded stock markets around the world amid reports that the US Federal Reserve could raise interest rates by up to 0.75% this week \u2013 its biggest single hike in nearly 30 years. Wall Street\u2019s benchmark S&amp;P500 index fell almost 4%. Media | Brexit campaigner Arron Banks has lost his libel suit against Observer and Guardian journalist Carole Cadwalladr. Banks sued Cadwalladr personally over two instances in which she claimed that he was lying about his relationship with the Russian state. Politics | Labour leader Keir Starmer is being investigated by parliament\u2019s standards commissioner over allegedly breaking the rules in registering financial interests worth more than \u00a318,000. Starmer said he is confident that he has not breached any rules.  In depth: \u2018We\u2019re sad \u2013 and incandescent with rage\u2019  On Saturday, a group of Indigenous volunteers searching for Dom Phillips and Bruno Pereira in an area of flooded forest near the River Itaqua\u00ed found a blue tarpaulin tied to a tree. Nearby, reported the Guardian\u2019s Tom Phillips, they found an item of clothing they recognised. \u201cThey\u2019re Bruno\u2019s! They\u2019re Bruno\u2019s!\u201d they shouted. Dom Phillips and Pereira had been travelling in the Javari region, the largest refuge for uncontacted Indigenous tribes in the world. They had been expected to arrive in the town of Atalaia do Norte after a four-day reporting trip where Pereira acted as Phillips\u2019 guide, last Sunday. But their boat never appeared. For the last eight days, amid frustration at the slowness of Jair Bolsonaro\u2019s government to respond, and gratitude to the Indigenous people who led the search, their families and friends have endured a purgatorial wait for news while preparing themselves for the worst. *** The search: heroism and failure Tom Phillips travelled with two dozen volunteers, members of four Indigenous peoples from the Javari region, as they went up and down the Itaqua\u00ed river in search of clues to the men\u2019s fates. He later tweeted: \u201cThe Indigenous people Dom and Bruno so admired are doing such incredible work in trying to track down their friends. No words to express my respect for them.\u201d Dom Phillips\u2019 wife Alessandra Sampaio and sister Sian urged the authorities to step up the search amid a growing public outcry over a slow official response. \u201cIn the forest, every second counts, every second could be the difference between life and death,\u201d Sampaio said. Editors from 20 major media organisations led by the Guardian and the Washington Post wrote an open letter to Jair Bolsonaro asking that he \u201curgently step up and fully resource the effort\u201d to find the men. A group of Brazilian celebrities, including football great Pel\u00e9, also joined the calls. And Indigenous leaders expressed their dismay at the lack of coordination in the search. *** The context: Bolsonaro\u2019s rhetoric and threats to the rainforest To many in Brazil, the disappearance of the men cannot be separated from Bolsonaro\u2019s incendiary rhetoric against journalists and Indigenous peoples. After the news of their disappearance, the far-right president said that Phillips and Pereira had been on an \u201can adventure that is not recommended\u201d. Lucy Jordan, the Brazil correspondent for Greenpeace\u2019s journalism outlet Unearthed, wrote: \u201cFor those of us who have been following Brazil\u2019s grim political reality for the past three years, we\u2019re not just sad, worried and fearful. We\u2019re also incandescent with rage.\u201d The men had been threatened the day before their disappearance, and a local fisherman was arrested after traces of blood were found on his boat. As well as being a haven for uncontacted tribes, the Javari region is a notoriously lawless area overrun with illegal loggers, miners and fishers as well as drug traffickers.  In this piece, Dan Collyns interviewed Scott Wallace, an expert on those tribes. He said that Bolsonaro\u2019s government \u201cseem to be in favour of extractive activities which end up plundering the forest\u201c and have \u201cceded these territories to criminal operations\u201d. Eliane Brum, a friend of Phillips who has reported on the rainforest for 25 years, wrote for the New York Times that the two men\u2019s disappearance indicated the severity of the threat to the rainforest and its inhabitants as well as those documenting it. \u201cTheir disappearance in the Amazon highlight the dangers facing those exposing the crisis facing Brazil\u2019s rainforest,\u201d she said. \u201cThe global community must respond swiftly and strongly.\u201d *** Dom and Bruno  The two men had taken a series of trips together over the last four years, as Pereira (above), 41, helped the 57-year-old Phillips with his research for a book about sustainable development in the rainforest. \u201cThey hunkered together in canoes and strung their hammocks next to each other between ancient trees,\u201d Andrew Downie and Tom Phillips wrote yesterday in a piece about their bond. \u201cThey shared meals out of cans, nudged one another at the silent passing of a monkey or crocodile, and when one of them fell face first into the murky waters of a river or swamp, the other was there to haul him out.\u201d Pereira, a father of two small children, has been seen as one of the leading advocates for the rights of Indigenous peoples in Brazil. After many years working to help Indigenous communities defend themselves and protect their lands, he was fired from Brazil\u2019s Indigenous affairs agency, Funai, after Bolsonaro became president in 2019. He said he was removed after his team destroyed an illegal mining base on an Indigenous reservation. Andrew Downie and Caio Barretto Briso write that Pereira \u201cfaced regular threats but with a serenity based in the knowledge he was doing crucial work for peoples he loved and respected\u201d. One friend of his tells them: \u201cThe Funai explorers don\u2019t like to be called heroes. But there\u2019s no way to agree with that modesty. These people are heroes and Bruno is one of them.\u201d  Phillips (above) became a foreign correspondent after spending his early working life in London as a music journalist immersed in rave culture. He edited Mixmag for much of the 1990s (and helped popularise the term \u201cprogressive house\u201d). Later, Andrew Downie wrote in this tribute, he was \u201cone of the most stylish writers\u201d among foreign correspondents in Brazil, where he met his wife Alessandra, and hoped to adopt children. Lucy Jordan called him \u201ca dogged, sharp-eyed journalist and an incredibly kind man\u201d who \u201ctakes on risky assignments because he believes the stories he tells matter that much.\u201d Among the many remarkable stories he told was the one that formed his relationship with Pereira. In a 2019 piece for the Guardian, Phillips and photojournalist Gary Calton followed an expedition led by the Indigenous advocate, travelling more than 1,000km over 17 days to investigate a sighting of an uncontacted tribe over fears they could come into conflict with a nearby village. The piece begins as Pereira \u201ccracks open the boiled skull of a monkey with a spoon and eats its brains for breakfast\u201d \u2013 but he and Phillips recede to allow an attentive, intimate portrait of the jungle, and the Indigenous people, instead: \u201cThe men cut long, thin stabilising poles to help them balance over slippery logs lying across muddy rivers. They celebrate coming across an enormous, rare mahogany tree, spreading majestically over a spacious, sun-dappled stretch of jungle.\u201d Pereira told him: \u201cIt\u2019s not about us. The Indigenous are the heroes.\u201d What else we\u2019ve been reading  It\u2019s been five years since the Grenfell Tower fire and people are still asking: how could it have happened? In this long read, Robert Booth, the Guardian\u2019s social affairs correspondent, takes us through the ongoing 300-day inquiry to piece together who or what is to blame for one of the most tragic incidents in the UK in the past decade. Nimo Katy Balls writes on how much more complicated the government\u2019s fight to pass the Northern Ireland bill will be because of backbench Tories\u2019 declining faith in their leader. One minister tells her: \u201cThe protocol bill is becoming a proxy for support of Boris Johnson.\u201d Archie Tim Jonze spoke to John Lydon, AKA Johnny Rotten, for a fascinating interview that explored both the person and the persona.

                    "body": "Pumpkin spice season, which officially began the last Tuesday of August when Starbucks released its fall drinks menu, is not the same as fall. It\u2019s more about the idea of fall. During pumpkin spice season, there are no cold rainy days, or uncomfortable family gatherings. Instead, all is crisp air, fuzzy sweaters, leaf piles, college football, bonfires, Taylor Swift albums and an overwhelming feeling of coziness. Scandinavians have hygge; Americans have pumpkin spice. It\u2019s such a lovely idea that other coffee shops and grocery stores, in a quest to beat Starbucks at its own game, have started rolling out their pumpkin spice products earlier and earlier in August. The 7-Eleven pumpkin spice latte launched this year on 5 August, which, in the northern hemisphere, is still indisputably summer. Increasingly unlikely and downright gross products now offer pumpkin spice options, including bone broth protein, deodorant and poppers. There\u2019s nothing that can\u2019t be pumpkined.  During the fiscal year that ended on 30 July 2022, Americans purchased more than $236m in pumpkin-spice-flavored grocery items, according to the market research firm Nielsen IQ, a 24% increase over the previous year. This accounting doesn\u2019t include the myriad pumpkin spice household items like scented candles and dog shampoo or dishes and drinks in restaurants and coffee shops. Amazon declined to share how many pumpkin spice products it sells, but a keyword search turned up more than 138,000 items. These include not just cookies and pie filling (the two most popular applications of pumpkin spice), but also breakfast cereal, granola bars, hot chocolate, pet treats, baby food, beer, ramen, Goldfish crackers and Spam.  Starbucks reports that it has sold more than 600m pumpkin spice lattes in the US since the drink debuted in 2003 and 100m more pumpkin cream cold brews, available since 2019. Torani, one of the largest manufacturers of coffee flavorings, offers 15 different pumpkin syrups and sauces and sells more than half of them in August as coffeehouses start stocking up for the season. As of mid-August 2022, the company had already shipped enough product to flavor 17m pumpkin spice drinks, 4m more drinks than it sold during the entire fall of 2021. Strangely, although pumpkin is available throughout most of the world (and Starbucks pumpkin spice lattes in 82 countries), the pumpkin spice obsession remains limited to North America. Perhaps this is because the US and Canada are the only countries where people eat pumpkin pie, and pumpkin pie tastes less like pumpkin than the spices mixed with it. One of the two earliest published pumpkin pie recipes, both of which appeared in a 1793 cookbook called American Cookery by Amelia Simmons, used mace, nutmeg and ginger, while the other used molasses, allspice and ginger, and the flavor profile hasn\u2019t changed much over the past two centuries.  The blend we now think of as pumpkin pie spice \u2013 cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg and allspice \u2013 was codified by the McCormick spice company in 1934, around the same time as the rise of canned pumpkin, in order to \u201ctake the guesswork out of knowing which spices and amounts to use\u201d, according to a company spokeswoman. Although McCormick\u2019s pumpkin pie spice is available all year round, 76% of annual sales are between September and November. During those months it is surpassed in popularity only by cinnamon, nutmeg and poultry seasoning. In 2010, McCormick included pumpkin pie spice in its annual flavor forecast, a list of trends that the company\u2019s executives think will gain traction in the near future based on discussions with chefs, bakers and food writers, and McCormick\u2019s own production team. Because McCormick is the world\u2019s largest spice company, these prophecies tend to be self-fulfilling (this year they\u2019re pushing \u201cmiso caramel\u201d, in case you were wondering). In the case of pumpkin pie spice, the forecasters predicted that its appeal would expand far beyond pie, cake and cookies, and, lo and behold, it did, with a bit of help from the company\u2019s chefs and marketing team, who developed and disseminated a collection of recipes, sweet and savory, that incorporated the spice blend.  But why has pumpkin spice become the quintessential flavor of fall instead of, say, apple or pear? It\u2019s a matter of perception, says Jason Fischer, a professor of psychological and brain sciences at Johns Hopkins University. Most people have definite memories of eating apples and ideas of what apples should taste like. \u201cBut when you ask people what it\u2019s like to take a bite of pumpkin,\u201d Fischer says, \u201cthey\u2019ve never done that. It\u2019s a blank slate. It\u2019s something that\u2019s amenable to reading all these other sensory cues on to. You add spices to it, attach feelings of fall, imagine something sweet and creamy that you put in drinks.\u201d The Starbucks pumpkin spice latte \u2013 known to devotees as the PSL \u2013 was invented in the spring of 2003 when Peter Dukes, then the company\u2019s director of espresso, encouraged by the success of the gingerbread latte and the peppermint mocha the previous holiday season, decided to create a special drink for fall. According to legend and the Starbucks website, he and his team spent a day in a room decorated with pumpkins and kitschy fall decor alternating sips of espresso with bites of pumpkin pie in order to determine which flavors from the pie worked best with coffee. One of the early names for the drink was the fall spice latte, and indeed the PSL would be all spice, no gourd, until 2015 when Starbucks, with much fanfare, switched to a flavor syrup that contained actual pumpkin. It\u2019s entirely possible, Fischer says, that with different marketing and visual cues, the exact same drink could be repositioned as a midwinter spice latte or, in its iced form, a summer spice latte. (It also, as the food scientist Kantha Shelke points out, tastes a lot like chai.) But it won\u2019t. A pumpkin spice latte is a pumpkin spice latte because it, like the thousands of other pumpkin and pumpkin spice products, is only available from August through November. \u201cPumpkin spice\u2019s limited nature is what keeps it special,\u201d says Andrea Ramirez, the consumer and customer insight manager for Torani. \u201cIf it were widely available year-round, there wouldn\u2019t be the same anticipation, the countdown or the frenzy to get it while it\u2019s available.\u201d And when pumpkin spice is in season, customers take advantage. In a 2020 study of what it described as \u201ca major gourmet coffee chain\u201d, the NPD Group, a Chicago-based market research firm, determined that repeat PSL customers were three times more likely to order the drink than those who had never had one and that people whose orders contained PSLs were likely to pay an average of $2.77 more per order.  Pumpkin spice lovers aren\u2019t just willing to buy more, they\u2019re also willing to pay more. In a 2020 study of 40 grocery items across six retailers, MagnifyMoney, a personal finance site owned by Lending Tree, discovered an average 8.8% \u201ctax\u201d on pumpkin spice items. (Trader Joe\u2019s was the worst perpetrator, with an average pumpkin spice markup of 17.6%.) But if sales are any indication, shoppers don\u2019t care. Are they being duped? Would pumpkin spice by any other name taste so sweet? As an answer, Jason Fischer proposes this thought experiment: \u201cNext time you have a pumpkin spice latte, stop and reflect. What does it taste like? Does it really taste like pumpkin? Imagine what carving a pumpkin tastes like. It\u2019s nothing like the pumpkin spice latte, but it\u2019s also going to be part of your experience of the smell of pumpkin. The cues are never really absent,\u201d he concludes. \u201cWe never experience anything out of context.\u201d Especially if there is money to be made."

                    "body": "Elon Musk and Twitter were sued on Friday by a Florida pension fund seeking to stop Musk from completing his $44bn takeover of the social media company before 2025. In a proposed class-action lawsuit filed in Delaware chancery court, the Orlando police pension fund said Delaware law forbade a quick merger because Musk had agreements with other big Twitter shareholders, including his financial adviser Morgan Stanley and Twitter founder Jack Dorsey, to support the buyout.  The fund said those agreements made Musk, who owns 9.2% of Twitter, the effective \u201cowner\u201d of more than 15% of the company\u2019s shares. It said that required delaying the merger by three years unless two-thirds of shares not \u201cowned\u201d by him granted approval. Morgan Stanley owns about 8.8% of Twitter shares and Dorsey owns 2.4%. Musk hopes to complete his $54.20 a share Twitter takeover this year, in one of the world\u2019s largest leveraged buyouts. Musk, the world\u2019s richest person, also runs electric car company Tesla and leads The Boring Co and SpaceX. Twitter and its board, including Dorsey and CEO Parag Agrawal, were also named as defendants. Twitter declined to comment. Lawyers for Musk and the Florida fund did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The lawsuit also seeks to declare that Twitter directors breached their fiduciary duties, and recoup legal fees and costs. It did not make clear how shareholders believed they might be harmed if the merger closed on schedule. On Thursday, Musk said he had raised about $7bn, including from investors like the tech tycoon Larry Ellison, the Qatar state investment fund and the world\u2019s biggest cryptocurrency exchange, to help fund the takeover. According to the filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, Ellison is putting $1bn into the transaction. The Saudi Arabian investor Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, who had initially opposed the buyout, agreed to roll his $1.9bn stake into the deal, according to the filing. The filing also showed that a margin loan taken out by Musk to finance the deal would be reduced from $12.5bn to $6.25bn. The financing news came as CNBC reported that Musk will serve as temporary chief executive of the social media platform for a few months once the deal closes. Musk had no financing lined up when he announced plans to buy Twitter last month. Some of the new investors appear to share interests with Musk, a self-described \u201cfree speech absolutist\u201d who could change how the San Francisco-based company moderates content. Florida\u2019s state pension fund also invests in Twitter, and the state\u2019s governor, Ron DeSantis, said this week it could make a $15m to $20m profit if Musk completed his buyout. On Friday, the New York Times reported Musk said he would quintuple revenue to $26.4bn by 2028 from its $5bn last year, citing a proposal presented to investors. Under Musk, the company would reduce its advertisement income from 90% to nearly 45% of the company\u2019s total revenue. Advertising would generate $12bn in revenue and subscriptions nearly $10bn in 2028, according to the document, the publication reported. Another objective in the proposal is increasing Twitter followers to 931 million and also hiring more than 3,500 additional employees. Twitter has 229 million daily users worldwide. In afternoon trading, Twitter shares were down 60 cents at $49.76."

                    "body": "The sports hall of a school in New Malden, south-west London, may seem an unlikely venue for a revolution. But here, on an icy Thursday night, a revolution of sorts is taking place. Comrades are facing off, honing their skills and sharpening their reflexes. A group of raw new recruits, a motley rabble of women and men sucked inexorably into the cause, looks on. The local commander, a no-nonsense but cheerful woman named Lou, will take them to the end of the hall to issue them with equipment, show them how to use it, and explain the rules of combat. I say them. I mean us \u2013 for I am one of these raw recruits. And our weapons? Not muskets and bayonets, but paddles and wiffle balls. Paddles are like outsize table tennis bats, those cheeseboards with handles or, indeed, paddles. A wiffle ball is a light plastic one with holes (not to be confused with a Harry Potter quaffle). Welcome to the pickleball revolution. Pickleball is a cross between tennis, badminton and ping pong, played indoors or out, on a court about a quarter the size of a tennis court, and with a slightly lower net. It was invented by three dads on Bainbridge Island, near Seattle, in 1965 for their children, and is now the fastest-growing sport in the US. More than a million Americans took it up during the pandemic, bringing the total to nearly 5 million - among them Melinda and Bill Gates, various Kardashians, Friends\u2019 Matthew Perry and Leonardo DiCaprio.  And it\u2019s now over here. The school sports hall in New Malden is just one of 270 pickleball venues in the UK, and there are now estimated to be about 7,000 players. Pickleball England is aiming for 25,000 members by 2025. Two of the regulars here, Emma Robbins and Elaine Brown, both in their 50s, tell me why they like it. \u201cIt\u2019s such an easy game to pick up, there aren\u2019t too many rules, and before you know it you\u2019re having a little dink,\u201d says Emma. I, too, am hoping to have a little dink soon, whatever one of those is \u2026 \u201cIt\u2019s good exercise, it\u2019s strategic, it can be as hard or as easy as you want it to be, and most of the time it\u2019s just good fun,\u201d adds Elaine.  The size of the courts and the weight and speed of the ball (all less than in tennis), mean the learning curve is less steep. It\u2019s easier on the body, and it\u2019s a game for all ages: over there is Alan, in his 80s. Johnny is 24, and that\u2019s his dad, Patch. Elaine has brought her son Joe, who\u2019s 23, for the first time. \u201cShe\u2019s been banging on about it for ages,\u201d he moans. Pickleball is a family thing, and a social thing, inclusive and friendly. Emma\u2019s partner is cheerful Lou \u2013 Louise Fournilier Stephens \u2013 head coach of London Pickleball. Does she mean her doubles partner? No, partner partner. \u201cWe met through pickleball,\u201d says Emma. Of course, who needs apps when there\u2019s pickleball? Oh, and Elaine is national over-50s women\u2019s double champion. Right, it\u2019s time for us virgins to get involved. We\u2019re Joe, retired Chris, who\u2019s 69, Gail and Dan, Anita and Neil, Sam from the Guardian, and Militsa from Bulgaria. Lou shows us how to hold the paddle \u2013 much as you\u2019d hold a ping pong bat, though it\u2019s best to keep fingers off the flat surface otherwise they might get wiffled \u2013 and we practise pickleball keepy-uppy, hitting the ball up with one side of the paddle then the other.  The hall echoes with a percussive cacophony, the thwack of paddle on perforated plastic, the squeak of trainer sole on gym floor, as well as a warm buzz of chitchat, banter and bonhomie. Next comes the dink, an up-and-over-the-net shot. Up and over, up and over. The area near the net is known as the no-volley zone. (\u201cGuess what you\u2019re not allowed to do here?\u201d says Lou.) The area is also known as the kitchen: no one knows why, though most people have a joke about it, usually involving men not putting in an appearance in it enough, except perhaps at parties. In doubles, then, you can\u2019t have one of you hanging out at the net, smashing anything that comes your way. The serve is underarm, more about starting a point than trying to win it \u2013 an ace is rare in pickleball. The return has to bounce, too, so no Navratilova-style serving and volleying, please. We are soon actually playing proper games, with some half-decent rallies, even though we have been learning for no more than 45 minutes. You don\u2019t get to this stage in tennis for years; to be honest, I never really have done. In between points (you play to 11; only the serving side can score) we tap paddles with our partners, sportingly and encouragingly. What, even if we\u2019ve lost the point and it\u2019s all their fault? And now I\u2019m wondering if it\u2019s maybe all a teeny bit too \u2026 nice? I mean, fine in a Florida retirement village, y\u2019all have a nice day (even though it may well be your last). But here, on the mean streets of \u2026 [checks notes] the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames, do we not perhaps want a bit more attitude in our exercise? I\u2019m considering throwing a Nick Kyrgios wobbly: how easy is it to smash up one of these carbon-fibre paddles?  Plus there\u2019s the elephant in the sports hall: that name. There are a couple of stories as to how it came to be called pickleball. One is that the family dog of one of those dads on Bainbridge Island was called Pickles. The other is that it\u2019s a reference to something in rowing called a pickle boat, which is a crew of mixed abilities \u2026 But then, no one\u2019s heard of a pickle boat, so most people go with the dog story, even though it\u2019s less likely to be true (not least because when the game was born, Pickles the dog was yet to be). Anyway, it\u2019s a problem isn\u2019t it, for a sport to be called pickleball if it wants to be taken seriously? No self-respecting kid is going to want to play pickleball, are they, or dream of one day being a pickleballer? None of this seems to be an issue for anyone else in my group: they think the name is both amusing and fitting. Lou says pickleball gets very competitive, pointing to the doubles match on the next court which has turned into an epic pinball volley\u2019n\u2019dinkathon. They are also getting some serious exercise. I feel as if my workout has been quite gentle, but that\u2019s the thing about pickleball \u2013 you can play at any level. As my level increases, I will play with greater intensity. And it will, and I will. Because it turns out I\u2019m brilliant at pickleball, a total natural, nimble of foot and thought, powerful and masterful on the forehand, cunning on the back, and the deftest of dinkers. The only thing that might need a little work, Lou thinks, is the attitude. OK then, sign me up. Viva la revoluci\u00f3n. TWO MORE NEW SPORTS TO TRY Teqball  What?A cross between football, table tennis and the south east Asian sport sepak takraw. Played on an arched table, players use any part of their bodies apart from arms and hands to hit a football over the solid net. As the name suggests, Teqball is technical, requires athleticism and coordination and can involve outrageous skills and fancy footwork. It is gender equitable. Where?Teqball was invented in Hungary in 2012 by former footballer Gabor Borsanyi while messing about with a ball and a table tennis table. It has established followings across Europe and in Brazil. Efforts are being made to include it in forthcoming Olympics. Who?Teqball was officially launched in Budapest in 2016 by Brazilian footballer Ronaldinho, since when David Beckham, Lu\u00eds Figo, Lional Messi and Neymar have all got involved, and many European football clubs, including Brighton &amp; Hove Albion have tables at their training grounds. A table costs from about \u00a31,500. Say what?Shane Black, director of Iron Man 3: \u201c\u201cThis is to me the future of keeping your kids fit.\u201d Padel What?A cross between tennis and squash. Courts are smaller than tennis courts, can be indoor or out and are enclosed, so the ball can be played off the walls, made of wire mesh and glass. Confusingly, padel uses rackets, not paddles, but they are solid (with holes) rather than stringed; the ball is slightly softer than a tennis ball. Usually played in doubles, it\u2019s fast-paced, accessible and social. Where?Padel was invented in Mexico in 1969.

                    "body": "Marcus Smith has been told he cannot dwell on Harlequins\u2019 agonising European exit if he and the club wish to retain their domestic Premiership crown this season. Quins are due to host the league leaders Leicester this weekend and their senior coach Tabai Matson is urging the England fly-half to shake off last weekend\u2019s disappointment as swiftly as possible. Matson has revealed his players were so gutted about their one-point aggregate defeat against Montpellier that afternoon training this week was replaced by a light-hearted game of cricket to bolster morale. Smith was as disappointed as anyone having missed a crucial late conversion but his coaches have challenged him to bounce back immediately.  \u201cIf you\u2019re as successful a goal-kicker and game leader as him you just can\u2019t dwell on things for too long,\u201d Matson said. \u201cYou have to be good at bouncing back and we did have that conversation. He moves on really quickly which is an important trait for someone in his position and with the lot of responsibility we give him.\u201d Quins are confident, though, that the 23-year-old will ultimately be the better for the experience. \u201cI don\u2019t think anyone who\u2019s become world class has had an easy ride,\u201d said Matson. \u201cExits like this are things to learn from. \u201cYou forget he\u2019s played more than 100 games of Premiership rugby and all the other accolades he\u2019s got. All those experiences are really important and what you want him to do is learn from them, whether that\u2019s for a big Test match for England or for us in the playoffs in a couple of months, hopefully.\u201d Matson, meanwhile, is not a great fan of the current European structure which has seen Montpellier advance to the last eight despite winning only two games in this season\u2019s tournament. \u201cUltimately we won five games and they won two. It\u2019s not sour grapes, they were better than us over the last two games so they deserved to go through. \u201cBut it does make the first part of pool play farcical if they can get two cracks at it. A team that comes first in the league plays the team that comes eighth and there\u2019s really no advantage other than that you get to play at home in the second leg. That\u2019s not really an advantage.\u201d Dean Richards is set to switch to a less prominent role at Newcastle at the end of the season after 10 years as the Falcons\u2019 director of rugby and previous stints in charge at Harlequins and Leicester.  \u201cI\u2019ve been doing it for 25 years or so and it\u2019s been a long haul, to be honest,\u201d said Richards. \u201cAt the same time I\u2019m still keen as mustard, and still enjoy the sport and the match days more than anything. If I\u2019ve got anything to announce, I\u2019ll tell you one day.\u201d"

                    "body": "Every December for nearly a decade, Mahir Mahbub and his friends meet in a halal steakhouse to enjoy all-you-can-eat ribs and wings, and exchange gifts.\n\u201cWe\u2019d all been friends for years but didn\u2019t have many traditions around the holidays. None of us are really religious, despite all being raised in Islamic households,\u201d Mahbub says. The group of nine, all in their late 20s and 30s, have been exchanging gifts and eating countless wings together since 2012. Gifts over the years have included everything from watches to bottle openers and, in 2007, a scooter that was given as the result of an old high school bet between two friends, Faz and Zid. It\u2019s a Secret Santa, basically \u2013 but it has come to hold a special place in the friends\u2019 hearts.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want it to ever stop,\u201d Mahbub says. \u201cIt\u2019s a nice way for the lads to come together and have a meal, which we rarely do as a group. We\u2019ll probably get our kids in on it in the future, although the gift limit will probably be $500 by then, thanks to inflation or whatever.\u201dMost families have an entire history book\u2019s worth of traditions \u2013 Friday night takeaway or movies that get watched whenever everyone\u2019s under the same roof. But unlike Mahbub and his circle, many of us don\u2019t know the specific joy that comes with developing and celebrating traditions within friendship groups.\n\nBut where to start and how to make it last? Well, there are a few ways to do both.\n\nStart small\nAs fun as it sounds to plan an annual overseas trip with your best mates, traditions that revolve around holidays, gifts and food can be both time-consuming and expensive. Thankfully, there are many different ways to start traditions with people who are short on both time and money.\nEach year, Declan Peach and his group of friends make an effort to celebrate birthdays in a low-effort but high-reward way.\n\u201cAt everyone\u2019s birthday, we all get in a circle and go around saying why we love the birthday person,\u201d Peach says. \u201cWhat started out as a fun game after a couple of drinks has become one of my favourite birthday traditions. There\u2019s something really special about telling someone why you love them in a group setting like that. And, of course, hearing 20 best friends tell you why they love you isn\u2019t so bad either.\u201d\n\nBuild a tradition out of a shared interest\nIdentifying what brings you together is a great starting place when it comes to brainstorming new traditions.\nPerhaps you watch the finale of every season of RuPaul\u2019s Drag Race together, or see every new Marvel movie at the cinema on premiere day with a friend who shares a common pop culture obsession. Hosting an annual end-of-summer party or an election party every three years could also appeal to different kinds of friends.\n\nSet an intention for your tradition\nIn addition to their birthday compliment circle, every New Year\u2019s Eve Peach and his friends decide on a theme or intention for the upcoming year. \u201cOne year it was \u2018loving your friends more\u2019 and the next it was ohana, a Hawaiian word for family, because we\u2019re so close,\u201d he says.\nThe perfect first step to starting a tradition is to consider what you hope it achieves. Are you looking for company? A new way to stay in touch with long-distance friends? Or an excuse to celebrate together more often? Whatever the reason, setting an intention for your tradition is a surefire way to make sure it ends up a fulfilling one.\nHonour your tradition by giving it a name\n\nSeveral years ago in the dead of winter, my colleague Anjali and I decided to start Soup Club. The idea came to us after Anjali made far too much soup on a Sunday night and brought an extra serve into the office, along with a spare bread roll. I happily accepted both and the following week brought my own soup for us both to enjoy. While Soup Club was a short-lived tradition, it was a highlight of my least favourite season.\nSharing lunch with a co-worker \u2013 especially a big-batch meal such as soup \u2013 isn\u2019t particularly revolutionary, but giving our lunch club a name made it feel more official than it probably deserved to be and, as such, warranted extra effort from both of us.\nDon\u2019t force it\nMost Saturday nights Sylvia Fitzgerald, 87, goes to the movies.\nSixty years ago she moved to a new street in Charlestown in New South Wales where she met a group of women who have remained some of her closest friends since. For the past three years \u2013 save for weekends spent in lockdown \u2013 on most Saturday nights Sylvia cooks dinner for one of these friends, Margaret, before they go to the local cinema together.\u201cWe do see quite a lot of movies. And I do have quite a different opinion on some movies she likes,\u201d Margaret says. \u201cWe like to go between 6pm and 6.30pm. Some time ago there was a movie we desperately wanted to see and it started at about 8.30pm. We felt very adult going out at that time of night to see a movie.\u201d\n\nWhile Sylvia and Margaret\u2019s weekly movie date is something they both look forward to, they always understand if something else comes up. \u201cI\u2019m a widow and she\u2019s also a widow, so on a Saturday night we\u2019re both usually free,\u201d Margaret says. \u201cBut we have this understanding that if anything comes up with the family that takes priority, of course.\u201d\nTraditions need to be a little flexible \u2013 holding them too tightly will often cause them to crumble. Above all else, it\u2019s important to remember that a tradition doesn\u2019t have to take place every single week, month or year to count."

                    "body": "Joe Biden has decided not to take the Iranian Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) off the US foreign terrorist list, according to the Israeli prime minister, dealing a heavy blow to the chances of the Iranian nuclear deal being revived. In a statement, Naftali Bennett said he had been informed by the US president that he would not be ceding to the Iranian demand that IRGC\u2019s terrorist status be lifted. \u201cI commend the US administration, led by my friend President Joe Biden, on the decision to keep the [IRGC] in their rightful place \u2013 on the foreign terrorist organizations (FTO) list,\u201d Bennett said.\u201cPresident Biden is a true friend of Israel who is committed to its strength and security \u2026 This is the right, moral and correct decision by President Biden, who updated me on this decision during our last conversation. For this I thank him.\u201d Iranian negotiators had made clear that the lifting of the terrorist status was a precondition for returning to the talks and it is hard to see in the short term how the talks can now be revived. The Iranian nuclear deal was negotiated in 2015, but after the Trump administration quit it in 2018, Biden pledged to negotiate terms for an American return. More than a year\u2019s worth of talks in Vienna had seen America, negotiating indirectly, agree the terms for a return, and the steps Iran would have to take to come back into compliance. Most of the sanctions imposed on Iran would have been lifted. The issue of the IRGC\u2019s status, and sanctions on the organisation, was one of the last outstanding issues. US officials argue that the IRGC\u2019s terrorist designation was technically never part of the nuclear deal itself, and the designation relates to the IRGC\u2019s wider behaviour in the region, and not to the nuclear deal. But supporters of a return to the deal argue that the terror label was among a host of non-nuclear penalties Trump had imposed on Tehran, and if it was lifted it might be possible to persuade Iran to change its stance towards Saudi Arabia and in Yemen. In recent weeks, Qatar has taken a leading role in the backdoor negotiations, and has been privately urging Biden to go further. In the view of some diplomats, Biden felt he could not lift the terrorist designation so close to the November midterm elections. Washington has not confirmed it has made a decision on the IRGC. The state department spokesperson Ned Price was asked at a daily briefing on Monday whether he would confirm Biden had decided not to remove the IRGC from the designation list. He said he would not comment on the issue, but that the subject could not be seen as part of the talks in Vienna. \u201cThe discussions in Vienna have been solely focused on the nuclear issue,\u201d Price said. \u201cIf Iran were to seek to discuss issues that are extraneous to the nuclear agreement itself, that is a discussion we are prepared to have, but, of course, Iran would have to make concessions of its own.\u201d Iran has repeatedly said the designation issue has to be part of the talks. A top IRGC colonel was shot dead on Sunday, leading Iran to promise revenge. Israel has allegedly been involved in a number of assassinations of Iranian officials, but Tehran has not yet directly blamed it for this attack.  The US special envoy on Iran, Robert Malley, in his written evidence to Congress on Wednesday, said the US had made clear to Tehran that if they wanted to take the IRGC off the list, Washington would need something in return. \u201cI think that Iran has made the decision that it\u2019s not prepared to take the reciprocal steps,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThey have to decide now, are they prepared to reach a deal without extraneous demands.\u201d"

                    "body": "When Emma Hayes walked into the press conference room after Chelsea\u2019s 3-2 extra-time defeat of Manchester City in the FA Cup final, she had Ji So-yun\u2019s shirt in her hands. It was signed \u2018To Emma\u2019 and the manager placed it on the table in front of her in tribute to her departing midfielder.\nThe South Korean, who has been at the club for eight years and is one of Chelsea\u2019s longest-serving players, has been telling Hayes she wants a statue.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t give her a statue but I want her to know that I am honouring her in the best way I possibly can by putting her front and centre,\u201d said an emotional Hayes. \u201cIf I could, I\u2019d put Drew [Spence] and Jonna [Andersson] there, side by side. I think I realised today that they\u2019re going, and I want to cry because I\u2019m so gutted to lose three brilliant people.\u201d\nJi, 31, has been the fulcrum of the attack, helping the club to each of their 11 major trophies in the WSL era. Filling the hole is nigh-on impossible. Hayes said it was important not to even try to replace her like-for-like. However, part of the solution can be seen in the growing influence of the 23-year-old Erin Cuthbert.\n\u201cOh for sure she is [the future of Chelsea\u2019s midfield]\u201d, said Hayes. \u201cAnd desperately needed too. We\u2019ve lost Ji and Drew and Melanie Leupolz, who will be back, I might add, if she\u2019s listening; she\u2019s going to remind me that she\u2019ll be back the minute that baby comes out.\u201d\n\nCuthbert has been a powerhouse in the closing stages of the season, shifting into a more central role after being the workhorse who would fill in wherever necessary.\n\n\u201cErin\u2019s in her home,\u201d said Hayes. \u201cIt was always going to be her home. We have a plan, we\u2019ve always had a plan, to develop players. Look at Lauren James. She\u2019s come into the club, people might say: \u2018Why did she come to the club, she\u2019s not playing?\u2019 It\u2019s not as simple as that. We\u2019ve had to build Lauren up to be prepared for the future, just like Jessie Fleming, maybe Erin Cuthbert before that.\n\u201cIn our environment you need time to bed in. It\u2019s a world-class environment, you\u2019re not just going to get straight into the team and Erin [Hayes lets out a big sigh]: \u2018Oh my God, can we make 20 of her?\u2019 She is amazing. Absolutely amazing. I was going to say I wish she was English, but she won\u2019t like me saying that.\u201d\nThe Scotland international has had to be patient but it is paying off. She scored to put Chelsea 2-1 up in the final and was named player of the match.\n\n\u201cI was shocked \u2013 I thought it was going to Sam,\u201d she said with a huge grin. \u201cI\u2019ve not let it sink in. I was too busy singing in the dressing room and my calves are about to fall off.\n\u201cI feel like I\u2019ve had to wait a wee while to get to where I finally am now, but patience is a virtue as they say,\u201d she said, when told of her manager\u2019s comments. \u201cI want to learn; I know that I\u2019ve got so much more to learn about the position. I\u2019ve almost kind of just been thrown in there in the last few months of the season. I actually want to take the time in pre-season to fine-tune details, know when I can and can\u2019t go. I\u2019m an aggressive player but sometimes that\u2019s to my detriment because I leave a lot of space behind me, so I\u2019ve got a lot to learn and I\u2019m glad that I\u2019m finally able to practise my trade.\u201d\nOne thing she has been keen to add is goals. \u201cJust hit it,\u201d she said of her edge-of-the-box effort. \u201cThe first half I didn\u2019t get high enough, I didn\u2019t get around the second balls, didn\u2019t get around the box. A couple of them dropped in the first half and I wasn\u2019t in there, and the forwards gave me a hard time at half-time. So I made sure that I got myself up and Beth [England]\u2019s set it beautifully. Just touch and strike, and if you don\u2019t buy a ticket, you don\u2019t win the raffle, eh?\u201d\n\nWhat of filling Ji\u2019s boots? \u201cOh, she\u2019s just a magician. Every time I use one touch, she congratulates me. It\u2019s like \u2018small passes, small passes\u2019, in training all the time. She\u2019s been a great mentor. Ji So-yun is unbelievable because she can change a game just like that, and that\u2019s something that I\u2019m trying to learn to do.\u201d\nWhat does the mentor think? \u201cErin said after the game the second goal was for me,\u201d said Ji. \u201cShe has grown so much. She did really well today.\n\u201cIt\u2019s difficult to express my feelings fully after my last Chelsea game. It\u2019s a very special part of me and the past eight years means everything to me. It\u2019s a very special club. It\u2019s the best team in the world.\u201d"

I\u2019ll leave you with David Hytner\u2019s report of a dramatic match. Goodnight!\n\n\n\n\n 10.13pm  \n\nVirgil van Dijk\u2019s verdict\n\u201cHard work. We should forget the first half as soon as possible. The early goal doesn\u2019t help us but we weren\u2019t good enough. We had to dig deep, we had to be very mature, and in the second half we were outstanding with and without the ball.\n\u201c[What did Jurgen Klopp say at half-time?] Play football. Play the Liverpool way. Play the way we\u2019ve been playing all season. Get on the ball, have a lot of movement. But also, show how much we want to go to the final.\n\u201cLuis Diaz has been incredible. The way he is one v one \u2013 it doesn\u2019t matter who he\u2019s facing, he just goes at them without any fear, and if he loses the ball he gets it back as quickly as possible. Go again, go again. And that\u2019s very difficult to defend.\n\u201cIn the first half we didn\u2019t play football. There wasn\u2019t enough movement so you make the wrong decisions, and then you lose the ball in difficult situations. If we dwell on the first half when we\u2019re going to Paris, I think we\u2019re being harsh on ourselves. What we\u2019ve done this season can\u2019t be taken for granted.\n\u201cWhoever we play in the final will be a nightmare to play against. We know City inside out, they know us; we know how intense those games are. And Real Madrid are Real Madrid: such a big club, with a very in-form striker. We\u2019ll see tomorrow. I\u2019m gonna watch it probably.\n\u201cThere\u2019s no point thinking about a quadruple. You can dream, but you have to be realistic. You saw the first half tonight - we could have been knocked out. That\u2019s football. But it\u2019s something we have to enjoy. For me personally, this time last year I wasn\u2019t even close to playing; now I\u2019m in two finals. We\u2019ll go for it.\u201d\n\nUpdated at 10.17pm BST\n\n\n 10.07pm  \n\n\u201cSo both teams got to enjoy a comeback,\u201d says Matt Dony. \u201cI mean, Liverpool probably enjoyed it more, but at least it was exciting. (Easy to say in hindsight!) I knew very little of Luis Diaz when he signed. \u00a337m seems like a ridiculous price tag! Liverpool\u2019s purchasing really has been astonishing.\u201d\nI\u2019m intrigued by his career trajectory. He\u2019s 25, but his numbers don\u2019t stand out at all until this season (I think he got six goals from 30 games in the league in 2020-21). He reminds me so much of Luis Suarez.  \n\n\n\n 10.03pm  \n\nMore from Trent Alexander-Arnold\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t play in the football in the first half, we didn\u2019t pick up the second balls. They played the game they wanted to and we allowed them to do that. It was difficult for us. In the second half we played the way we needed to play and controlled the game a lot better. One bad half over the two legs\u2026 we can concede that as long as we get the job done.\n\u201cIt\u2019s always nice to get the job done on the Tuesday, so we can watch the game tomorrow knowing that we\u2019re already there. It could be another amazing game. Either opponents deserves to get to the final, so I\u2019m excited to see who we\u2019ll get.\u201d\n\nUpdated at 10.05pm BST\n\n\n 10.01pm  \n\nFabinho\u2019s reaction\n\u201cThey gave everything in the first half. We knew the first 15-20 minutes would be really important; they scored early and that gave them confidence [and got the fans going]. It was maybe our hardest first half of the season. But after the first goal we controlled the game and now we\u2019re in the final.\n\u201cWhen I received the ball from Mo Salah my first thought was to pass, but I wasn\u2019t sure whether Sadio was offside so I decided to shoot. I think it was the best option!\u201d\n\nUpdated at 10.05pm BST\n\n\n 10.00pm  \n\nTrent Alexander-Arnold\u2019s reaction\n \u201cWe don\u2019t make these Champions League semis easy for ourselves: Roma away, Barca at home and now here. They played very well in the first half, but we grabbed the game by the scruff of the neck in the second half and did what we needed to do.\n\u201cWe expected it to be difficult in the first half. Sometimes you can\u2019t control the game how you want to. But we got it done and we\u2019ve booked our ticket to Paris.\u201d\n\n\n\n 9.56pm  \n\nThe Villarreal players are going on a lap of honour; quite right too. There\u2019s a lovely atmosphere at El Madrigal, with both sets of fans celebrating in different ways.\n\n\n\n 9.51pm  \nFull time: Villarreal 2-3 Liverpool\n\nThat\u2019s it! Liverpool are through to their tenth European Cup final, and will play either Manchester City or Real Madrid in Paris on 28 May. They were given a helluva fright by Villarreal, who deservedly led 2-0 at half-time, but Jurgen Klopp\u2019s half-time teamtalk and the introduction of the wonderful Luis Diaz turned the game on its head.\nLiverpool dominated the second half even more than Villarreal did the first, with Fabinho, Diaz and Sadio Mane scoring their goals. Villarreal will regret their cautious start to the second half, at a time when they had Liverpool on the rack, but ultimately the best team went through.\n\n\nUpdated at 10.27pm BST\n\n\n 9.48pm  \n\n90 min Two minutes of added time.\n\n\n\n 9.47pm  \n\n89 min Liverpool break four on two. Mane picks out Salah, who is off balance and shoots wide.\n\n\n\n 9.44pm  \nCAPOUE IS SENT OFF!\n\n86 min The disappointment is all too much for Villarreal. Etienne Capoue, who made both goals in the first half, has now been sent off. He was on a yellow card and took out Curtis Jones, a challenge born of frustration. It was a clear bookable offence. The home fans applaud him off the field nonetheless.\n\nUpdated at 9.44pm BST\n\n\n 9.43pm  \n\n84 min Pau Torres is booked for a late, ultra-cynical tackle on Mane. Liverpool want him sent off; the referee ignores them. It was somewhere between a yellow- and a red-card offence.\n\n\n\n 9.42pm  \n\n84 min Fabinho, whose goal dragged Liverpool away from the precipice, is replaced by James Milner.\n\n\n\n 9.41pm  \n\n82 min \u201cFor 45 minutes that was more exciting than it needed to be,\u201d says Bill Jones. \u201cIt\u2019s good to see things returning to just one more boring Champions League win.\u201d\nIf it stays like this, Liverpool will have won all six away games in this season\u2019s competition. That can\u2019t have happened too often (though Bayern definitely did it two seasons ago).\n\n\n\n 9.39pm  \n\n81 min Lo Celso is booked for Fabinhoing Fabinho.\n\n\n\n 9.39pm  \n\n81 min Rulli makes a fine save with his legs to deny Curtis Jones after a mistake from Pau Torres. Villarreal\u2019s collective noggin has gone.\n\n\n\n 9.38pm  \n\n80 min And two changes for Liverpool. Boulaye Dia and Raul Albiol are replaced by Serge Aurier and Manu Trigueros.\n\n\n\n 9.38pm  \n\n79 min Multiple changes for Liverpool, whose attention now turns to Spurs on Saturday. Jordan Henderson, Curtis Jones and Konstantinos Tsimikas replace Keita, Thiago and Robertson.\n\n\n\n 9.35pm  \n\n77 min Parejo\u2019s free-kick from the left flashes just wide of the far post. I think it took a slight touch, possibly off the head of Robertson, though a goalkick was given.\n\n\n\n 9.34pm  \n\n77 min Alexander-Arnold is booked for pulling back Pedraza. Yellow cards don\u2019t matter at this stage, unless you get two of them.\n\n\n\n 9.34pm  \n\nRulli, who has had a bit of nightmare, charges 40 yards from goal to challenge Mane but only manages to tackle fresh air. Mane moves away from him, withstands Lo Celso\u2019s desperate challenge and rolls the ball slowly into the empty net.\n\n\nUpdated at 9.52pm BST\n\n\n 9.32pm  \nGOAL! Villarreal 2-3 Liverpool (Mane 75; agg 2-5)\n\nLiverpool\u2019s comeback is complete!\n\n\nUpdated at 9.39pm BST\n\n\n 9.32pm  \n\n74 min Villarreal know it\u2019s over. And though they have ultimately been beaten by a better team, they will forever wonder what might have happened had they not started the second half so cagily. Their approach, though understandable, invited trouble, and they got it.\n\n\n\n 9.29pm  \n\n71 min He doesn\u2019t play in the same position. But in his skill, improvisation, charisma and sheer irrepressibility, Luis Diaz reminds me so much of Luis Suarez. He\u2019s an incredible find; this time last year he wasn\u2019t even a regular at Porto.\n\nUpdated at 9.31pm BST\n\n\n 9.28pm  \n\n70 min That was a really good header from Diaz, who was backpedalling and off balance but strained his neck muscles to power a header towards goal. He has done unto this game as Vinnie Jones did unto Gazza.\n\n\n\n 9.27pm  \n\n69 min Two changes for Villarreal: Alfonso Pedraza and Samuel Chukwueze replace Gerard Moreno, who has been struggling with his hamstring since around the half-hour mark, and Francis Coquelin.\n\n\n\n 9.26pm  \n\nDiaz\u2019s introduction changed the entire match, and it\u2019s fitting that he should score. Alexander-Arnold curled a superb inswinging cross with his left foot, and Diaz ran beyond a static defence to force a downward header through the legs of Rulli. Both goals have gone through the legs of Rulli, though there was nothing much he could do about that one. \n\n\n\n 9.25pm  \nGOAL! Villarreal 2-2 Liverpool (agg: 2-4; Diaz 67)\n\nLiverpool are heading to Paris, and they have Luis Diaz to thank!\n\n\nUpdated at 9.31pm BST\n\n\n 9.24pm  \n\n67 min The resulting corner is headed not far wide by Konate. It\u2019s all Liverpool now.\n\n\n\n 9.24pm  \n\n66 min: Diaz hits the post! This fella\u2019s a magician. He wriggles away from Foyth and Capoue, improvising all the while, before hitting a shot that brushes Albiol and deflects onto the outside of the far post!\n\n\n\n 9.23pm  \n\n65 min Dia, who has done very little apart from score the opening goal that changed the entire mood of the tie, has a chance to play Moreno through but hits it straight at Konate. The angle wasn\u2019t great but that was still an opportunity for Villarreal.\n\n\n\n 9.21pm  \n\n63 min Capoue overruns the ball, lunges at Fabinho and is booked. For a split second I thought he was going to be sent off, but a yellow card was the right decision.\n\n\n\n 9.20pm  \n\nThat goal has been coming since half-time. Fabinho had a rare wander forward and found Salah on the right. He poked the ball back infield to Fabinho, in space on the right side of the area, and he thrashed a shot that went straight through the legs of Rulli. That\u2019s a pretty bad mistake from the keeper I\u2019m afraid.\n\n\n\n 9.20pm  \nGOAL! Villarreal 2-1 Liverpool (agg: 2-3; Fabinho 62)\n\nLiverpool are back in front in the tie!\n\n\nUpdated at 9.35pm BST\n\n\n 9.18pm  \n\n60 min Diaz has looked sharp and full of purpose since coming on at half-time. \u00a337m my foot; he\u2019s already worth twice that.\n\nUpdated at 9.19pm BST\n\n\n 9.17pm  \n\n59 min Liverpool have been better since half-time but I also think Villarreal have become more cautious. I know it\u2019s human nature, especially when you are the underdog, but their aggressive approach worked so well in the first half.\n\n\n\n 9.15pm  \n\n57 min Diaz shins a scissor kick over the bar. That looked a decent chance, though I\u2019d like to see a replay before judging him unfavourably.\n\n\nUpdated at 9.19pm BST\n\n\n 9.14pm  \n\n56 min A corner is half cleared to Thiago, who shoots straight at Rulli from the edge of the area. Liverpool look the likelier scorers at the moment.\n\n\n\n 9.13pm  \n\n55 min: Alexander-Arnold hits the bar! A free-kick is played short to Alexander-Arnold, 30 yards out. He takes a couple of quick touches and leathers a shot that hits Coquelin and loops onto the top of the crossbar.\n\n\n\n 9.11pm  \n\n53 min \u201cVIL v LIV,\u201d says Stan T in California. \u201cThe palindrome game.\u201d\n\nUpdated at 9.11pm BST\n\n\n 9.09pm  \n\n51 min Salah plays in Alexander-Arnold, who slices a cross wide of the near post before being wiped out by Estupinan. Liverpool\u2019s intensity has been much better since half-time, though we haven\u2019t yet seen the usual quality.\n\n\n\n 9.07pm  \n\n49 min Alexander-Arnold\u2019s deep, dipping free-kick hits the unsighted Mane and rolls wide of the far post.\n\n\n\n 9.06pm  \n\n48 min Keita is fouled 25 yards from goal by Estupinan. Liverpool, as you\u2019d expect, have made a livelier start to the second half.\n\n\n\n 9.03pm  \n\n46 min Villarreal begin the second half. \n\n\n\n 9.03pm  \n\nJust one half-time change for Liverpool. Luis Diaz replaces Diogo Jota. That move isn\u2019t a surprise, but I thought Jordan Henderson would come on for Naby Keita as well.\n\n\n\n 9.01pm  \n\n\u201cLiverpool are discovering the price of having full backs who, while brilliant going forward, are not too hot on the basics of defending,\u201d says Frank. \u201cRobertson didn\u2019t do enough to close down the cross for the second goal while Trent just stood as his man jumped. Also, Thiago is the guy you want when you\u2019re in the ascendancy but can he dig you out of a hole?\u201d\nIt\u2019s interesting that both Everton and Villarreal have targeted Robertson and Alexander-Arnold in recent weeks, with a reasonable amount of success. I still think they\u2019re the best full-back pair in the world, mind you.\n\n\n\n 8.56pm  \n\nI\u2019ve changed my mind again on Capoue\u2019s first assist. I think he was trying to shoot, but he was off balance, under pressure from Robertson, and that\u2019s why he screwed the ball back across goal.\n\n\n\n 8.55pm  \n\n\u201cAs a gloomy Chelsea fan,\u201d begins Claire McConnell, \u201cif I never hear the word \u2018quadruple\u2019 again it will raise my spirits considerably.\u201d\nIf there\u2019s one subject I know about, it\u2019s premature \n   <strike>\n     e \n   </strike>schadenfreude, and I fear you\u2019ve gone too early there.\n\n\n\n 8.52pm  \n\nNext stop, rocket science\n\n\n\n\n 8.50pm  \n\nHalf-time entertainment\n\n\n\n\n 8.49pm  \nHalf time: Villarreal 2-0 Liverpool (agg: 2-2)\n\nLiverpool are officially embroiled. They have been outplayed, outsmarted and outfought by Villarreal, who are level in the tie thanks to goals from Boulaye Dia and Francis Coquelin. Join us in 15 minutes for the second half. Spoiler alert: it gets emotional.\n\n\n\n 8.48pm  \n\n45+2 min \u201cHello from Javea, Costa Blanca north,\u201d says Magali Fradet. \u201cMy Airbnb guests flew over from Liverpool and are now in the Villarreal stadium. I\u2019m feeling very torn \u2026 but hey, aren\u2019t Villarreal amazing?\u201d\nI feel slightly ashamed for giving them such little chance tonight. Did I learn nothing from the last 20 years?\n\n\n\n 8.47pm  \n\n45+1 min Two minutes of added time.\n\n\n\n 8.44pm  \n\n45 min Breaking news: a hairdryer is on charge in the away dressing-room. Liverpool have been an unfathomable mess in this first half.\n\n\n\n 8.43pm  \n\nFrancis Coquelin, once of Arsenal, has brought Villarreal level in the tie! Again it came from a cross, this time by Capoue on the right. He Cruyff-turned away from Robertson and lofted a left-footed cross to the far post. Coquelin got the wrong side of the unvigilant Alexander-Arnold, hung in the air for an age and steered an excellent header into the corner.\n\n\nUpdated at 8.54pm BST\n\n\n 8.41pm  \nGOAL! Villarreal 2-0 Liverpool (agg: 2-2; Coquelin 41)\n\nIt\u2019s 2-2!\n\n\nUpdated at 8.53pm BST\n\n\n 8.41pm  \n\n39 min Gerard Moreno, who has played brilliantly on his return from a hamstring injury, is moving gingerly. Samuel Chukwueze is warming up and may well be needed. \n\nUpdated at 8.41pm BST\n\n\n 8.39pm  \n\n37 min: Huge Villarreal penalty appeal turned down! Lo Celso was put through on goal and tried to go round Alisson, who dived bravely at his feet. Both men ended up in a heap, and on first viewing it looked a really tight call, but replays showed it was a clean bit of keeping from Alisson. If anything, Lo Celso fouled him. But it was a great chance for Villarreal, stemming from a mistake by Keita. He\u2019s had a dreadful first half, as he did in Spain against Real Madrid last season.\n\n\nUpdated at 8.44pm BST\n\n\n 8.36pm  \n\n34 min This has been Liverpool\u2019s worst performance in a while - certainly since the first half at the Etihad and probably a lot longer than that. They just need to get to half-time at 1-0 and allow Jurgen Klopp to work his magic.\n\nUpdated at 8.36pm BST\n\n\n 8.33pm  \n\n31 min Boulaye Dia\u2019s early goal remains the only shot on target in the game. Villarreal have been much the better side but they haven\u2019t created many opportunities.\n\n\n\n 8.31pm  \n\n30 min Gerard Moreno is having a fine game. His movement has been very smart; he\u2019s constantly pulling away from van Dijk to find space in behind Robertson.\n\n\n\n 8.29pm  \n\n29 min Albiol brazenly wipes out Mane and is fortunate to avoid a yellow card.\n\n\n\n 8.29pm  \n\n29 min \u201cLiverpool need to find their inner Everton,\u201d says Simon Kirchin, a message that can be interpreted a number of ways.\n\n\n\n 8.28pm  \n\n28 min The pace of the game has slowed a little in the last few minutes. Normally that would be a bad thing for Liverpool, but at the moment it suits them. \n\n\n\n 8.27pm  \n\n26 min The pitch is playing well enough despite all the rain. There are a few areas where the ball is holding up, especially on the right side of the Liverpool penalty area, but it hasn\u2019t really affected the game yet.\n\n\n\n 8.26pm  \n\n24 min Salah shoots just wide from 15 yards after a bit of a scramble in the area, though the referee had blown for something or other. There was a chance for Jota earlier in the move that would have counted: he was put through on goal by a clever square ball from Salah, but a slightly heavy touch allowed Raul Albiol to get back and smother the danger with the help of the keeper Rulli.\n\n\n\n 8.22pm  \n\n20 min In the parlance of our time, Liverpool are suffering. They look a bit ragged both in defence and attack, though you know they won\u2019t play like this all night. Villarreal need to make the most of their dominance.\n\n\nUpdated at 8.29pm BST\n\n\n 8.19pm  \n\n18 min \u201cIs it possible,\u201d says Brendan Large, \u201cthat the fact that this isn\u2019t a standard massive European stadium, (and more like a fourth- or fifth-round FA Cup tie stadium) makes this more difficult for Liverpool?\u201d \nOh, absolutely, and so far the atmosphere has been tremendous.\n\n\n\n 8.18pm  \n\n17 min Keita, who hasn\u2019t started well, throttles a shot wide of goal from 25 yards. He had better options to his right.\n\n\n\n 8.17pm  \n\n16 min: Chance for Villarreal! This is getting a bit too lively for Liverpool\u2019s taste. A hanging cross from the left is headed towards goal by Moreno and hits Robertson in the face. He didn\u2019t know much about that. I suspect Alisson had it covered, though I wouldn\u2019t bet the farm on it.\n\n\n\n 8.15pm  \n\n14 min Thiago clips the top of the bar from 20 yards, though a foul had been given against Keita. It was a softish decision, though I think the whistle had been blown before Thiago\u2019s shot, so it wouldn\u2019t have gone to VAR even if he had scored.\n\n\n\n 8.14pm  \n\n14 min You knew it was coming, and Peter Oh has obliged us with a simple two-word email. \u201cOh Dia.\u201d \n\nUpdated at 8.15pm BST\n\n\n 8.14pm  \n\n13 min Moreno\u2019s dangerous cross from the right is headed away by van Dijk. At the moment it\u2019s Liverpool who are struggling to breathe.\n\n\n\n 8.13pm  \n\n12 min A loose ball breaks to Parejo, who shoots not far wide from 22 yards. Alisson had it covered, but these are nervous times for Liverpool.\n\n\n\n 8.11pm  \n\n11 min Robertson\u2019s mishit free-kick is miskicked wide from 15 yards by Jota. He wanted a corner; the referee didn\u2019t oblige him.\n\n\n\n 8.11pm  \n\n10 min \u201cWhen the camera cut to Unai Emery after the goal,\u201d begins K\u00e1ri Tulinius, \u201che had the expression of a man weighing willing his team not to do anything stupid in the next five minutes.\u201d\nAnd they\u2019ve managed it, so I bet he\u2019s doing a Singin\u2019 in the Rain jig now. \n\n\n\n 8.10pm  \n\n9 min Keita was at fault for the goal too - he allowed Estupinan to cross far too easily. Liverpool haven\u2019t settled yet.\n\n\n\n 8.09pm  \n\n8 min \u201cVan Dijk joined Liverpool in 2018, four years and four months ago from today,\u201d says Yash Gupta. \u201cHe also missed about a year due to injury. So the greatest of all time are now decided by a three-and-a-half-year spell. Smart thinking from Owen who no doubt using the same logic was about to honk - HE HIMSELF IS THE BEST STRIKER OF ALL TIME.\u201d \n\n\n\n 8.08pm  \n\n5 min I did Capoue a disservice. Not only did he get the wrong side of Robertson, he showed great awareness and coolness to guide the ball back across to Dia. Capoue\u2019s would have been a good chance; Dia\u2019s was an open goal.\n\nUpdated at 8.09pm BST\n\n\n 8.06pm  \n\nVillarreal have got the early goal they craved! Estupinan\u2019s terrific cross from the left was diverted back across goal by Capoue, and Boulaye Dia passed it into the empty net from six yards. It looked like a great chance for Capoue, and I\u2019m not 100 per cent sure he was trying to find Dia. But he did, and Villarreal are back in it.\nAlisson, who scrambled across his line in an attempt to cover a possible shot from Capoue, was out of the game when the ball went back across to Dia.\n\nUpdated at 8.07pm BST\n\n\n 8.04pm  \nGOAL! Villarreal 1-0 Liverpool (agg: 1-2; Dia 3)\n\nHello!\n\n\nUpdated at 8.16pm BST\n\n\n 8.03pm  \n\n2 min An update from Joe Watt in Valencia (see 19.57). \u201cAnd now the electricity is gone.\u201d\n\n<strike>\n     On the plus side \n   </strike>, you can still read this liveblog on your phone.\n\n\n\n 8.01pm  \n\n1 min Peep peep! Liverpool kick off from right to left. The rain has stopped.\n\n\n\n 7.59pm  \n\n\u201cIs it safe,\u201d says Peter Oh, \u201cfor the Estadio de la Cer\u00e1mica to host an exhibition of heavy metal football?\u201d\nHa. Liverpool would be happy with 90 minutes of Brian Eno tonight. \n\n\n\n 7.57pm  \n\n\u201cI\u2019m down the road from Villarreal in Val\u00e8ncia,\u201d says Joe Watt. \u201cJust sprinted one minute to the pub and I\u2019m soaked through. God knows what will happen in this weather.\u201d\n\n\n\n 7.56pm  \n\nThe players are about to walk onto the field. The Villarreal fans are making one helluva noise.\n\n\n\n 7.48pm  \n\nA reminder of the teams\nVillarreal (4-4-2) Rulli; Foyth, Albiol, Pau Torres, Estupinan; Lo Celso, Capoue, Parejo, Coquelin; Moreno, Dia.Substitutes: Asenjo, Jorgensen, Mario Gaspar, Alcacer, Iborra, Chukwueze, Trigueros, Pena, Mandi, Moi Gomez, Pedraza, Aurier.\nLiverpool (4-3-3) Alisson; Alexander-Arnold, Konate, van Dijk, Robertson; Keita, Fabinho, Thiago; Salah, Jota, Mane.Substitutes: Kelleher, Milner, Gomez, Henderson, Oxlade-Chamberlain, Jones, Minamino, Tsimikas, Diaz, Origi, Matip, Elliott.\n\n\n\n 7.48pm  \n\n\u201cAm all athrill with anticipation!\u201d coos Ian Copestake. \u201cTo have the class of a Thiago balanced by the giraffe legs of Fabinho prodding out dangers all over the pitch. I have no idea how a side like City function. They just have lots of amazing small players. But this lot make sense in a sort of old-fashioned, cogs-in-a-machine way.\u201d \n\n\n\n 7.46pm  \n\n\u201cThere are at least 15 Premier League sides that would absolutely love to trot out Liverpool\u2019s bench as their starting XI (minus one, obviously). You know they\u2019ve got depth for days, but to see it laid out like that is frightening stuff.\u201d\nAs if to rub it in, Jurgen Klopp has picked a bench that you can fit into a realistic XI, rather than one of those fantasy teams people pick with Pele and Maradona at centre-half.\nLiverpool (4-3-3) Kelleher; Milner, Matip, Gomez, Tsimikas; Oxlade-Chamberlain or Elliott, Henderson, Jones; Minamino, Origi, Diaz. \n\nUpdated at 7.50pm BST\n\n\n 7.43pm  \n\nJurgen Klopp\u2019s pre-match thoughts\n\u201c[Is it dangerous to think you\u2019re through already?] They have nothing to lose, we have nothing to win, so we\u2019ll decide what we think. We\u2019re going to treat this like a one-off final and go for it.\n\u201c[On the two changes from the first leg] It is rotation, but also there are specific moments where you want a specific skillset, and that\u2019s why we decided on this line-up. \n\u201cI look at Villarreal and think, \u2018What would I do?\u2019. Two-nil down, maybe didn\u2019t play your best football \u2026 give it a go. That\u2019s exactly what Villarreal will do. They will go for it, but we will as well, so let\u2019s see.\u201d\n\n\n\n 7.17pm  \n\n\n\n\n\n 7.16pm  \n\n\u201cVillarreal were swamped by the Liverpool press and barely coped,\u201d says Tim Stappard. \u201cUnai Emery is extremely good but he can\u2019t give his team more time. Benfica troubled them more, and it\u2019s a weak Benfica too.\u201d\nThat second sentence is great, and so neatly put. I knew Manchester United should have appointed Neo as their new manager.\n\nUpdated at 7.47pm BST\n\n\n 7.11pm  \n\nPresented without comment On BT Sport, Michael Owen has just announced that Virgil van Dijk is the greatest centre-half of all time.\n\n\n\n 7.07pm  \n\n\n\n\n\n 7.06pm  \n\n\u201cI will unavoidably miss the first half tonight,\u201d writes our resident Liverpool supporter Matt Dony, \u201cso I\u2019ll get all my groaning negativity in early doors. It all seems a little \u2018too\u2019 comfortable. Villarreal are a very good side (they\u2019re in the semi-finals of the Champions League, for goodness sake!), and 2-0 isn\u2019t exactly the world\u2019s most astonishingly comprehensive lead. \n\u201cYes, Liverpool should go through. But the level of confidence in certain areas of social media is hubristic and fool hardy. The abolishment of the away goals rule is absolutely a good thing. But I\u2019d quite like to bring it back in tonight. Who do I need to speak to?\u201d\nI\u2019ve been trying to make sense of this as well. I\u2019ll be honest, I\u2019m expecting a quiet night in the MBM dungeon, and I think that\u2019s due to the manner of the first leg rather than the scoreline. It reminds me of that old line about album reviews: \u201cSure, they gave you 6/10, but it reads like an 8.\u201d \nThe first leg was a 2-0 that read like a 4-0, which is why most of us think Liverpool will progress comfortably. That and because they are formidably good. But as a neutral I would love extra-time, penalties, the whole shebang.\n\nUpdated at 7.13pm BST\n\n\n 7.06pm  \n\nThe weather in Villarreal has been atrocious for the last 48 hours, which could make life interesting for the goalkeepers. The pitch is sodden but apparently there\u2019s no danger of the game being abandoned.\n\n\nUpdated at 7.13pm BST\n\n\n 6.42pm  \nTeam news\n\nThe excellent Gerard Moreno returns to the Villarreal side, but they are without the injured Arnaut Danjuma. That\u2019s a big blow. Moreno for Danjuma is one of two changes from the first leg at Anfield. The other is also up front, where Boulaye Dia is in for Samuel Chukwueze.\nJurgen Klopp also makes two changes from last week\u2019s first leg: Naby Keita and Diogo Jota replace Jordan Henderson and Luis Diaz.\nVillarreal (4-4-2) Rulli; Foyth, Albiol, Pau Torres, Estupinan; Lo Celso, Capoue, Parejo, Coquelin; Moreno, Dia.Substitutes: Asenjo, Jorgensen, Mario Gaspar, Alcacer, Iborra, Chukwueze, Trigueros, Pena, Mandi, Moi Gomez, Pedraza, Aurier.\nLiverpool (4-3-3) Alisson; Alexander-Arnold, Konate, van Dijk, Robertson; Keita, Fabinho, Thiago; Salah, Jota, Mane.Substitutes: Kelleher, Milner, Gomez, Henderson, Oxlade-Chamberlain, Jones, Minamino, Tsimikas, Diaz, Origi, Matip, Elliott.\nReferee Danny Makkelie (Netherlands)\n\nUpdated at 7.06pm BST\n\n\n 6.30pm  \nPreamble\n\nA year is a long time in association football. On 3 May 2021, Liverpool were seventh in the Premier League and seven points off Champions League qualification. Now they are two games away from a seventh European Cup and could be seven games (plus one Manchester City drawfeat) from an historic quadruple. \nFootball is a never-ending tale of the unexpected, a thought that will sustain Villarreal ahead of tonight\u2019s match at El Madrigal. The first leg was so one-sided - a 2-0 that felt like a 4-0 - that most neutrals think Liverpool are as good as in the final already. It\u2019s not a view that will be shared in the away dressing-room or the away end. Liverpool\u2019s legend has been built on glorious European comebacks, from Juventus in 1965 to Barcelona in 2019, so they know all about the madness of the second leg.\nIf Liverpool get the first goal, it\u2019s over. If Villarreal score it, all bets are off.\nKick off 8pm.\n\n\n"

Thanks for your company and emails - goodnight!      6.44pm    Thomas Tuchel\u2019s verdict \u201cIt\u2019s been a very challenging week physically and mentally. The performance was very controlled, very serious. We took very good care of their counter-attacks. It was the kind of match where, maybe if you lose 1-0 from a set-piece, you have the feeling, \u2018Did we invest enough?\u2019 But it\u2019s very hard to invest because the opponent is prepared, they played a new system, they changed system twice. It\u2019s very, very hard and you cannot lose focus for one second. And if you win the game you say, \u2018We were very patient and very controlled\u2019, and we were. \u201cRuben Loftus-Cheek was excellent. He was very, very strong against Southampton and Madrid and would have deserved to start, but honestly we expected a back four and we wanted more of a classic wing-back position. We also wanted Azpi on the field as our captain, but we knew Ruben could make an impact from the bench. We\u2019re very happy with him at the moment. He is always like this in training but sometimes he has hidden his potential in matches. \u201cI\u2019m happy to be part of another FA Cup final. It\u2019s a huge competition; I\u2019m very grateful and we will be ready.\u201d     6.31pm    Ruben Loftus-Cheek\u2019s post-match thoughts \u201cIt\u2019s been a tough road for me, with injuries and going out on loan. But I always wanted to play for Chelsea and I\u2019ve played quite a lot this season so I\u2019m happy. I think the goal took a little deflection, but I\u2019ll take it! The noise was incredible and I\u2019m overjoyed. \u201cIt looked a bit slow in the first half so I wanted to bring a bit of energy. The reason why I\u2019m still here is because of my mentality despite all the injuries \u2013 I keep going no matter what, and I\u2019ve said for many years that my time would come. \u201cWe want to get Liverpool back, simple as that. I thought the Carabao Cup final was a fantastic game that could have gone either way. We\u2019re looking forward to it, and hopefully we\u2019ll get our revenge.\u201d     6.28pm    \u201cSo it\u2019s Chelsea vs Liverpool again,\u201d writes Bilal. \u201cHow often has it happened that the same teams have contested the League and FA Cup finals in the same season?\u201d The last time it happened, and I think the only time, was when Arsenal beat Sheffield Wednesday in both finals in 1992-93.     6.23pm   Full time: Chelsea 2-0 Crystal Palace  Peep peep! Chelsea will play Liverpool in next month\u2019s FA Cup final after a hard-fought win over Crystal Palace. After a quiet, attritional first hour, the substitute Ruben Loftus-Cheek gave Chelsea the lead after a mistake from Tyrick Mitchell. Mason Mount\u2019s classy second goal ensured that Chelsea reached the FA Cup final for the fifth time in six seasons. Palace can have no complaints, but nor should they have any regrets.    Updated at 6.33pm BST    6.20pm    90 min: Lukaku hits the post! Werner scurries into the area on the left and puts it on a plate for Lukaku, who somehow hits the post from seven yards. Ziyech\u2019s follow-up is blocked desperately on the line, I think by Guehi.     6.19pm    89 min The player of the match is Timo Werner, who made the second goal and troubled Palace all day with his movement.  Updated at 6.19pm BST    6.18pm    88 min The match is petering out. Palace have given everything but Chelsea are heading for yet another FA Cup final.     6.14pm    85 min Meanwhile, Palace bring on Luka Milivojevic for Cheikhou Kouyate. And Rudiger is going to continue.     6.14pm    84 min Rudiger is down with what looks like a thigh or groin problem. Chelsea have used all five substitutions, though they will get a sixth if this goes to extra-time.   Updated at 6.15pm BST    6.11pm    82 min Chelsea make their fifth substitution - Thiago Silva comes on for Andreas Christensen.     6.10pm    81 min Ziyech shoots straight at Butland from long range.     6.09pm    78 min: What a chance for Andersen! Palace should be back in it. Olise\u2019s inswinging corner from the right was helped on by Ayew, and looped towards the unmarked Andersen beyond the far post. But he jumped too early and headed over the bar from four yards.     6.07pm    77 min A triple change for Chelsea: N\u2019Golo Kante, Hakim Ziyech and Romelu Lukaku replace Jorginho, Mount and Havertz.     6.06pm    Mason Mount has made it 2-0 with a lovely finish. Werner, on the left side of the area, made the goal with a nice square pass to Mount, just inside the penalty box. He took it neatly in his stride, escaping Andersen in the process, and opened his body to sidefoot the ball into the far corner. That\u2019s a fine goal.  Updated at 6.07pm BST    6.05pm   GOAL! Chelsea 2-0 Crystal Palace (Mount 76)  Chelsea will be coming back to Wembley next month.    Updated at 6.21pm BST    6.04pm    74 min Ayew plays a clever pass into the area for Zaha, who takes it away from the outrushing Mendy. The angle is too wide for a shot so he hits a cross on the turn instead, and eventually the attack peters out.     6.02pm    72 min A double change for Palace: Christian Benteke and Michael Olise replace James McArthur and Jeffrey Schlupp, so Patrick Vieira is going for it. And why not.     6.00pm    71 min Here\u2019s Ruben Loftus-Cheek\u2019s goal.      5.59pm    70 min Palace are readying Christian Benteke.     5.59pm    69 min All of a sudden Chelsea have a bit of a strut on. It\u2019s a long way back from here for Palace, who have been in counter-attacking mode all afternoon.     5.57pm    67 min That\u2019s Loftus-Cheek\u2019s first goal for Chelsea in three years, it says here.     5.56pm    Actually, it took a deflection, not that Loftus-Cheek will care. After Mitchell was caught in possession, Havertz\u2019s cross from the right hit Guehi and bounced towards the edge of the area. Loftus-Cheek ran onto the ball, twisted his body and slapped a shot that hit Andersen and flew into the net.  Updated at 6.00pm BST    5.55pm   GOAL! Chelsea 1-0 Crystal Palace (Loftus-Cheek 65)  Ruben Loftus-Cheek gives Chelsea the lead with a sizzling finish!   Updated at 6.16pm BST    5.53pm    63 min Azpilicueta\u2019s dangerous cross is headed away well by Andersen in the six-yard box. Palace have defened admirably.     5.51pm    61 min: What a chance for Palace! Eze\u2019s inswinging corner is shouldered just wide by Kouyate, who mistimed his attempted header. With a clean connection he would probably have scored.   Updated at 5.54pm BST    5.50pm    60 min Zaha beats Christensen on the right and angles a deep cross that is headed behind by Azpilicueta.     5.49pm    60 min \u201cThis,\u201d says Ian Copestake, \u201ccould go on forever.\u201d     5.48pm    59 min Chelsea are completely dominating possession, with around 70 per cent in the match, but they still haven\u2019t created a clear chance. It\u2019s been an attritional game.     5.47pm    57 min I say 3-4-3; really it\u2019s a 5-4-1.     5.46pm    56 min It looks like Palace have switched to a 3-4-3, with Ayew wide on the right, Eze wide on the left and Zaha the lone striker.     5.44pm    54 min A change for Palace - Jordan Ayew replaces Jean-Philippe Mateta.    Updated at 5.53pm BST    5.43pm    53 min A Palace free-kick is headed up in the air by Kouyate and claimed under the bar by Mendy.     5.41pm    52 min Rudiger hoofs well wide from distance.     5.41pm    51 min Loftus-Cheek takes a return ball from Jorginho and stabs a clever through pass towards Werner, who is eased away from the ball by Kouyate in the six-yard box. Good defenduing.     5.38pm    49 min Mount blazes over from distance.     5.38pm    48 min Chelsea have picked up where they left off at half-time, moving the ball from side to side in pursuit of an opening. Nothing doing so far.     5.35pm    46 min Peep peep! Chelsea begin the second half.     5.20pm    \u201cIf Chelsea are the designated home team,\u201d asks Gary Byrne (and others), \u201cwhy are they wearing yellow?\u201d I have no idea. You\u2019re welcome!     5.19pm    Half-time reading      5.19pm   Half time: Chelsea 0-0 Crystal Palace  Peep peep! An uneventful half comes to an end. Chelsea dominated possession, but Palace came closest to scoring when Cheikhou Kouyate\u2019s volley was pushed away by Edouard Mendy. See you in 15 minutes for the second half.     5.17pm    45 min There will be two added minutes.     5.14pm    42 min More importantly for Palace, at this stage, they have looked really solid defensively. The only saves Jack Butland has had to make have been relatively comfortable.     5.13pm    40 min There have been some promising breaks from Palace, usually involving Zaha, but their final pass has either been ill-conceived or poorly executed.      5.11pm    39 min \u201cIn last year\u2019s final Tactics Tom did similar stuff with James at centreback to counter the threat of Vardy and that didn\u2019t work,\u201d says Yash Gupta. \u201cPlus this positional switch took away attacking impetus from Chelsea\u2019s right-hand side. If anything Palace have a decent chance.\u201d      5.10pm    38 min Havertz is booked for diving in the Crystal Palace area after a challenge from Guehi. Chelsea wanted a penalty but replays showed it was a brilliant and brave decision from Taylor.   undefined  Updated at 5.21pm BST    5.09pm    38 min \u201cThis,\u201d says Joe Pearson, \u201cis not nearly as fun as yesterday\u2019s semi.\u201d      5.08pm    36 min Zaha is fouled by James on the left wing, which allows Palace to send their centre-backs forward. Eze\u2019s inswinger is headed away to the edge of the area by Christensen, and Kouyate hits a crisp volley that is pushed away by Mendy, diving to his left. Anderson slams the rebound off the post from close range, though he was offside so it wouldn\u2019t have counted. But Kouyate\u2019s would have done.     5.06pm    33 min Mount shoots over the bar from the edge of the D. Chelsea are struggling to break down this well-organised Palace defence.     5.02pm    31 min At the other end, Werner runs Kouyate and curls a very deep cross to Azpilicueta, who slices a scissor kick miles wide.     5.01pm    30 min Palace break dangerously from a Chelsea corner. Zaha slips Loftus-Cheek on the halfway line, forcing the last man Christensen to come across and intercept. He can only give the ball straight to Ward, who overhits his through ball to Zaha.  Updated at 5.02pm BST    4.56pm    25 min: Chelsea substitution Yep, Loftus-Cheek replaces Kovacic in midfield.      4.56pm    25 min Rudiger\u2019s hopeful ball into the box is headed straight at Butland by Havertz. He was stretching, and under pressure from Guehi, so it wasn\u2019t much of a chance.     4.55pm    23 min Ruben Loftus-Cheek is getting ready to come on. It looks like he\u2019ll replace Mateo Kovacic, who is limping slightly. I think he twisted something when he slipped on the edge of the Palace area earlier in the game.   Updated at 4.56pm BST    4.53pm    21 min Nothing much to report. Lots of endeavour from both sides but no clear chances yet.     4.48pm    17 min The match has settled into the expected pattern of Chelsea possession and Palace counter-attacks.     4.46pm    15 min James\u2019s inswinging corner is headed away by McArthur.     4.45pm    14 min Havertz releases Werner on the left of the area. His cutback is put behind for a corner by McArthur, the first of the game...     4.42pm    11 min Kovacic runs dangerously to the edge of the D but then slips. Chelsea are starting to dominate possession.     4.41pm    10 min Mount\u2019s cross-shot from the left bounces awkwardly in front of Butland, who nonetheless holds on comfortably.  Updated at 4.41pm BST    4.40pm    9 min Patrick Vieira will be pleased with this start. Palace have looked comfortable, with no sign of any big-match nerves.     4.39pm    7 min Zaha turns James near the halfway line and reverses a good pass towards Mateta, who almost gets the wrong side of the last man Christensen. In the end Christensen recovers to poke the ball back to Mendy.     4.37pm    5 min Actually, Chelsea are playing with Reece James as the right-sided centre-back and Azpilicueta at wing-back. That might be because Wilfried Zaha is playing up front for Palace; James has always done well against him.     4.35pm    4 min A bitty start to the game, including a brief break in play while some balloons are cleared from the pitch.   Updated at 4.38pm BST    4.34pm    2 min Palace\u2019s formation is 3-3-2-2, as below. Chelsea are playing 3-4-1-2, as expected. Crystal Palace Butland; Kouyate, Andersen, Guehi; Ward, McArthur, Mitchell; Eze, Schlupp; Zaha, Mateta.  Updated at 4.38pm BST    4.31pm    1 min Peep peep! Palace, wearing their red and blue home strip, kick off from left to right. Chelsea are in their stylish yellow away kit. And it does indeed look like a back three for Palace.     4.29pm    The players walk out of the tunnel into the Wembley sunshine. It\u2019s a gorgeous day in north-west London.   Updated at 4.36pm BST    4.21pm    A question for Palace fans Can you recommend a book about the club\u2019s glory years under Steve Coppell and Alan Smith? And, if not, could one of you please write it?     4.20pm    A reminder of the teams There is some speculation that Palace will also play a back three, with Cheikhou Kouyate dropping into the defence. We\u2019ll soon find out. Chelsea (possible 3-4-1-2) Mendy; Azpilicueta, Christensen, Rudiger; James, Jorginho, Kovacic, Alonso; Mount; Havertz, Werner.Substitutes: Arrizabalaga, Thiago Silva, Sarr, Kante, Loftus-Cheek, Saul, Pulisic, Ziyech, Lukaku. Crystal Palace (possible 4-3-3) Butland; Ward, Andersen, Guehi, Mitchell; McArthur, Kouyate, Schlupp; Zaha, Mateta, Eze.Substitutes: Guaita, Clyne, Kelly, Tomkins, Milivojevic, Olise, Ayew, Edouard, Benteke. Referee Anthony Taylor.     4.19pm    \u201cI thought Palace had done well to keep it at 0-0,\u201d says Ian Copestake, \u201cbut then realised it hadn\u2019t started yet.\u201d      4.17pm    Thomas Tuchel\u2019s pre-match thoughts \u201cIt\u2019s good [to have another big game straight after the Real Madrid defeat], as it automatically sharpens your mind and your focus. Being here at Wembley is the right occasion to turn things round. [Romelu Lukaku] is not fit enough to play 90 minutes, he\u2019s not fit enough for the intensity of our game. He\u2019s had an injury so his match fitness is not there; otherwise there was a big chance he would have started today. \u201cWe\u2019re in good shape. We\u2019ve had two very good performances in our last two games. They\u2019re a very energetic team, nice to watch, with a lot of individual quality and speed up front. It\u2019s a difficult team and a big occasion.\u201d     4.10pm    Patrick Vieira\u2019s pre-match thoughts \u201cIt\u2019s wonderful to be here. It\u2019s a big day for the football club - the fans, the players, the staff - and we want to enjoy it. The best way to do that is to perform as well as we can. I was really happy with the way [Eze] played against Leicester. He may not give us the runs that Conor does but he\u2019s really good on the ball; he can create chances, he can dribble. I expect him to do well today. \u201cIt\u2019s about performing as a team. We know how good they are but we have the tools to make it difficult for them. We need to enjoy the occasion.\u201d     3.51pm         3.38pm    This is a really interesting piece on the guy behind the guy at Palace      3.31pm   Team news  Three changes from Chelsea from their 3-2 victory/5-4 defeat in Madrid. Cesar Azpilicueta, Jorginho and Andreas Christensen replace Ruben Loftus-Cheek, N\u2019Golo Kante and Thiago Silva.  Patrick Vieira makes four changes to the Palace team that lost 2-1 at Leicester last weekend. Jack Butland, Joel Ward, James McArthur and Eberechi Eze come in for Vicente Guaita, Nathaniel Clyne, the ineligible Conor Gallagher and Jordan Ayew. McArthur also captains the side.   Updated at 3.55pm BST    3.09pm         3.00pm   Preamble  Hello and welcome to live coverage of the FA Cup semi-final between Chelsea and Crystal Palace at Wembley. There are two ways this can go - the familiar tale or the fairytale. Chelsea are hoping to reach their 11th FA Cup final since the turn of the century; Palace are aiming for the third FA Cup final in their entire history.  Palace will be without the infectious Conor Gallagher, whose parent won\u2019t let him out to play tonight. Oh and they\u2019ve lost their last nine games against Chelsea. But for all my frankly inappropriate doom and gloom, Palace will fancy their chances of an upset. They are in good form, have troubled a number of big clubs this season and have an outside chance of their highest league finish since the glorious 1990-91 campaign. An FA Cup final appearance would cap a superb first season under Patrick Vieira. Chelsea want a repeat of the Carabao Cup final against Liverpool, ideally without Kepa spanking the decisive penalty halfway to Harlesden. They can still do a treble of sorts - the Club World Cup, the Super Cup and the FA Cup would be a decent return, especially given their off-field problems. Palace will hope that Chelsea\u2019s emotional Champions League defeat to Real Madrid has taken a lot out of them. We\u2019ll find out soon enough. Kick-off 4.30pm BST.  Updated at 3.11pm BST "

Thanks for reading and don\u2019t forget to check out our live blog of tonight\u2019s Premier League clash between Wolves and Leeds (8pm kick-off). Bye.     5.23pm    Nottingham Forest v Liverpool team news and a funky stat. Nottingham Forest will be without Scott McKenna for their FA Cup quarter-final against Liverpool. The defender limped off with a hamstring problem late in Wednesday\u2019s victory over QPR and is expected to be sidelined for a month. The news comes as a blow to Forest, who had already lost fellow defenders Steve Cook and Max Lowe. They will both miss at least a month with injuries picked up in the previous game against Reading last weekend. Influential Liverpool full-back Trent Alexander-Arnold is out for a number of weeks with a hamstring injury. Forward Mohamed Salah is still nursing a bruised foot which caused him some discomfort after coming off the bench in the midweek win over Arsenal and may be rested. Goalkeeper Alisson Becker will start, having previously shared duties with Caoimhin Kelleher. (PA Media)  Liverpool are winless in their last 12 away games against Nottingham Forest in all competitions (D7 L5), since a 2-0 victory in October 1984. It\u2019s the Reds\u2019 longest current winless away run against an opponent, while they last had a longer run against a side vs Arsenal (14 between 2000 and 2011).       5.16pm    Some Champions League draw reaction from a legend, a coach and a captain. Ian Rush on Liverpool facing Benfica: \u201cI\u2019m just happy that we didn\u2019t get an English team. To play Benfica is a good sign and also the second leg is at home as well.\u201d Bayern coach Julian Nagelsman on facing Villarreal: \u201cVillarreal are the defending Europa League champions. They have a very experienced coach and team, and have a clearly-defined style of play. Beating Juventus 3-0 is no easy feat. We want to advance, but will first need to play and win.\u201d Atl\u00e9tico Madrid captain Koke on facing Manchester City: \u201cThey\u2019re one of the favourites. Last season, they came very close to winning the Champions League. They have a great coach and players, and play great football, but we like that sort of challenge. I\u2019m sure our coach will come up with a strong plan to get us through the tie, but we know that it won\u2019t be easy.We have to go to Manchester first, and then we\u2019ll come back to Madrid to play in front of our fans. I think that will give us a boost in terms of confidence and strength as we try to make it through.\u201d (Quotes from uefa.com)     5.03pm    Well played Boro.      4.56pm    Fact of the day. Arguably better than Alan\u2019s one about crab sticks. * Barrow are the top scorers in the FA Cup this season with 10 goals, the same number as Manchester City and Chelsea.      4.50pm    Palace v Everton. Vieira v Lampard. Patrick Vieira\u2019s Crystal Palace v Frank Lampard\u2019s Everton. Who blinks first in Sunday\u2019s FA Cup quarter-final?  Four-time FA Cup winner and Everton boss Frank Lampard has won 10 of his 14 matches in the competition since becoming a manager ahead of the 2018-19 campaign (D2 L2), with Pep Guardiola (17) the only boss to oversee more victories in the competition since Lampard\u2019s first game in charge in the FA Cup.   Crystal Palace manager Patrick Vieira remains unbeaten in his last 18 games in the FA Cup as a player (15) and a manager (3), since losing the 2003-04 semi-final against Man Utd with Arsenal. Indeed, Vieira and Everton manager Frank Lampard lined up against one another during the 2002 final, a match in which the Gunners won 2-0 at the Principality Stadium with goals from Ray Parlour and Freddie Ljungberg.      4.43pm    Some pub ammo for Middlesbrough v Chelsea. Maybe avoid reading this if you\u2019re a home fan. Or print it for Chris Wilder to stick on the dressing room wall. \u201cLet\u2019s re-write history lads.\u201d  Middlesbrough have never won against reigning European champions in 20 attempts (D7 L13), playing more such games without ever winning than any other English side. This is their first such match since February 2013, and a home defeat in the FA Cup against Chelsea.    Chelsea have gone on to progress from 15 of their last 19 FA Cup quarter-final ties, with only Everton (26), Man Utd and Arsenal (both 30) reaching the final four on more occasions than the Blues in the competition\u2019s history (25 times).   Thomas Tuchel has progressed from each of his last seven ties at the quarter-final stage across all competitions as both PSG and Chelsea manager, a run which started halfway through the 2018-19 campaign (Coupe de France x2, Coupe de la Ligue, Champions League x2, FA Cup, League Cup).      4.36pm    Nice story here revealed by commentator Richard Kaufman.       4.29pm    All that talk of a Liverpool Quadruple, well what about a Manchester City treble? Here\u2019s Jamie Jackson\u2019s piece.      4.22pm    Middlesbrough boss Chris Wilder went full tiny violin emojis and sarcy pants when talking about FA Cup quarter-final opponents Chelsea earlier today. Responding to speculation that the Blues may not be able to fly to Teesside for the match due to limits being placed on their spending, Wilder couldn\u2019t resist a playful dig. \u201cThey won\u2019t make a long coach trip. They\u2019ll be looking down the back of the settee this afternoon to see if they can find a couple of quid \u2013 I usually look at the golf bag, that\u2019s where I keep a couple of quid just to keep it away from people \u2013 and chuck it into a pot to get up on the plane. \u201cWhat happens? The millionaire footballers all club together and chuck a couple of quid in and hire their own private jet. They\u2019re all on possibly, over \u00a3100,000 a week \u2013 it\u2019s quite a big number, that.\u201d You tell \u2018em champ.     4.13pm    FA Cup quarter-final: Crystal Palace v Everton. Team news for the first of Sunday\u2019s three last-eight clashes (12.30pm). Crystal Palace manager Patrick Vieira has no fresh injury concerns to contend with. Luka Milivojevic, Will Hughes and Martin Kelly missed Monday\u2019s 0-0 draw with Premier League leaders Manchester City but are in contention this weekend. Joel Ward was on the bench for that game after a period sidelined with a groin injury. Palace midfielder James McArthur and full-back Nathan Ferguson are not training. Everton midfielder Allan starts a three-match suspension for his red card against Newcastle on Thursday, although the club have appealed the dismissal. Defender Jonjoe Kenny, however, returns from a one-match ban. Goalkeeper Jordan Pickford remains absent with illness so Asmir Begovic will continue to deputise. January signings Donny Van De Beek, Dele Alli and Anwar El Ghazi are all cup-tied. (PA Media)  Updated at 4.30pm GMT    4.06pm    Cheers Luke. Some Spurs v West Ham team news here. Tottenham have no fresh injury concerns for the crunch London derby with West Ham. Spurs came through the midweek win at Brighton unscathed and Antonio Conte is likely to name an unchanged side. Japhet Tanganga (knee) has been ruled out for the season, Oliver Skipp (groin) will return after the international break while Ryan Sessegnon (hamstring) is at least four weeks away from a return to training. West Ham are still without Jarrod Bowen, Vladimir Coufal and Angelo Ogbonna. Bowen will be out until after the international break with a heel injury, Coufal has had groin surgery and Ogbonna is a long-term absentee with knee ligament damage. Boss David Moyes will check on Michael Antonio, who played 119 minutes against Sevilla despite needing a late fitness test. (PA Media)     4.00pm    Scott Murray is here with today\u2019s Fiver \u2013  And that is the lot from me today... I shall hand you back to my esteemed colleague David Tindall. Bye!     3.56pm    The Tottenham coach Antonio Conte has criticised his Arsenal counterpart Mikel Arteta for complaining about his side\u2019s fixture list. Arteta criticised the Premier League for scheduling Arsenal to play against Liverpool on Wednesday night and then Aston Villa on Saturday lunchtime.  But Conte said the Spaniard had no right to complain given the Gunners called off the north London derby in January, despite having only one confirmed case of coronavirus. The Premier League changed the rules regarding fixture postponements in the wake of that incident.  Conte said: \u201cArteta should remember the game postponed. Tottenham-Arsenal. In general, I think my answer is enough. If someone wants to think about fair or unfair. [It was] postponed the game, Tottenham-Arsenal. I don\u2019t forget this. And it\u2019s not right to speak about fair or unfair.\u201d      3.44pm    The Everton manager Frank Lampard hopes to have Allan\u2019s red card rescinded but what he does not want is another apology from referees\u2019 chief Mike Riley. It is only just over two weeks since Riley called Lampard and chairman Bill Kenwright to admit mistakes were made when VAR official Chris Kavanagh failed to advise referee Paul Tierney over a handball by Rodri which would have given Everton a chance of a late penalty equaliser against Manchester City.  Allan was sent off in the dramatic late win over Newcastle on Thursday night after Craig Pawson was advised to view the monitor and subsequently upgraded his yellow card to a red for the Brazilian\u2019s tackle on Allan Saint-Maximin. Everton have lodged an appeal against that decision and even if it is unsuccessful they will then appeal against the severity of the three-match ban.   \u201cIt\u2019s hard to say how hopeful we are,\u201d said Lampard on the appeal. \u201cWe had a really bad decision against us which we had an apology for but apologies don\u2019t mean points. There was nothing from that other than a \u2018Thanks very much\u2019. This one there is no need for an apology. It wasn\u2019t a decision that should have been changed to a red card. It was very clear from my end. In the cold light of day that is not a red card and we don\u2019t want to lose Allan for three games and now we are in their (an independent disciplinary panel) hands. With hindsight look at the decision and was it enough to warrant a red card? For me it wasn\u2019t.\u201d (PA Media)     3.30pm    A community of Chelsea fans say they have lodged a bid to buy around 10% of the club. The group is called ChelseaDAO (a Decentralised Autonomous Organisation) and they believe it should not require a billionaire to own the club.     3.29pm    Louise Taylor previews Middlesbrough v Chelsea in the FA Cup:      3.28pm    Frank Lampard, it appears, broke his hand while celebrating Everton\u2019s late winner against Newcastle last night.  \u201cI think I\u2019ve broken a bone in my hand,\u201d he said. \u201cAfter the goal I realised ... but for the three points we got, not a problem. I won\u2019t complain too much.\u201d      3.21pm    The Southampton head coach Ralph Hasenh\u00fcttl knows it will take a bit more than just refuelling his squad to get them back into top gear for Sunday\u2019s FA Cup quarter-final against Manchester City. After a seven-match unbeaten run in all competitions, the Saints were handed a reality check with three straight Premier League defeats - including at home by Watford last weekend.  \u201cIn every game (we lost), something different was missing, but the fact is that we haven\u2019t played on our highest level in all three games,\u201d Hasenh\u00fcttl said. \u201cThe question should be more why we didn\u2019t do it and then \u2018what can we do to make it happen again?\u2019 It is not like you speak about a car that you put some different fuel in and suddenly it runs better, you have to find the margins that were missing and then learn to reach this level which we had once again. This is something [we face] from the Premier League every week, that is clear.  \u201cWe had games where we couldn\u2019t find our rhythm or where we have been stopped with different way of killing our rhythm. But Sunday will be a completely different game against a very good team. We have had games against them when we had 50% possession, which is outstanding, but we also had games where we had only 28% and we took a point, so everything is possible. We have shown in these two games (against City) this season that we are able to draw against them, but on Sunday we need to win.\u201d (PA Media)     2.58pm    Pep Guardiola is relishing the \u201cmarvellous challenge\u201d Manchester City face defending their Premier League title. The title race could be set for a thrilling climax after Liverpool cut City\u2019s lead at the top to one point this week. Guardiola said: \u201cIt is what it is. In 14, 15 days, we will come back after the international break, then nine games. Everyone knows what we do. It is a marvellous challenge. We try to do it.\u201d City may be chasing glory in the Premier League and the Champions League but Guardiola has no concerns that intensity might drop for Sunday\u2019s FA Cup quarter-final at Southampton. He said: \u201cWe play every game like it\u2019s the last game of our lives. I know how difficult it will be away at Southampton but I trust a lot in my team, my players.\u201d (PA Media)   Updated at 3.07pm GMT    2.54pm    The latest entry in the race to buy Chelsea from Roman Abramovich for Chelsea is a joint bid by C&amp;P Sports Group and Hana Financial Group. The C&amp;P CEO, Catalina Kim, said: \u201cWe are preparing our bid. There has never been investment into a top-tier football club made by South Korean capital before. It is time for a change.\u201d     2.42pm    Steven Gerrard has urged his Aston Villa players to use Saturday\u2019s lunchtime clash with Arsenal to prove they can start competing with the top sides in the Premier League. \u201cThe teams at the top are there for a reason,\u201d Gerrard said. \u201cIt\u2019s about consistency, they\u2019ve recruited well, they\u2019ve got experience and some have got managers who have been with them for some time. There\u2019s a reality to where we\u2019re at at the moment but that\u2019s the area of the league we need to strive for, it\u2019s where we want to be operating of course. I\u2019m very much aware of the stats and those results but tomorrow gives us another opportunity to try to prove that when we\u2019re at our best we can take points off the top teams and the teams that are above us.\u201d   Arsenal have improved markedly under Mikel Arteta this season but the Spaniard, 39, was under pressure after they started the season with three straight league defeats. \u201cMikel has done a fantastic job and really found that consistency that Arsenal have been looking for so credit to him for that,\u201d he said. \u201cHe\u2019s come through a couple of periods where the pressure was on him and his team and you\u2019ve got to give people at Arsenal credit for backing him.\u201d (PA Media)  Updated at 2.46pm GMT    2.36pm    \u201cDelighted to get drawn against a \u2018proper\u2019 European club,\u201d emails Leicester City fan Rich Hutson. \u201cPSV may not be at the heights of the Van Nistelrooy/Robben/Van Bommel days but an away day against total football purists can never be a bad thing.\u201d     2.34pm    A report from Serie A below from our friends at Reuters, with Stefano Pioli getting a bit philosophical: AC Milan must take one game at a time and have their wits about them when they face relegation-threatened Cagliari on Saturday, coach Stefano Pioli said, as his side continue their quest for their first Serie A title since 2011. Milan, top on 63 points, are three points ahead of second-placed Napoli and four ahead of defending champions Internazionale, who are third with one game in hand.  \u201cWe must not put the cart before the horse. Virtually we are only one point ahead of Inter, perhaps Atalanta will lose a few points,\u201d Pioli said on Friday. \u201cThe traps and obstacles are still many. There are still many games, if we think too far we lose our reality of the moment. And this must not happen. It\u2019s tomorrow that counts. For the first four [teams in the league] the games are very open, every match is at the crossroads.\u201d While Cagliari are hovering above the relegation zone, Pioli stressed that they would make for difficult opponents, as Milan are looking to extend their unbeaten run in all competitions to 10.  \u201cWe know the difficulties. Cagliari have stopped Napoli,\u201d he said. \u201c[We] need a performance with intensity and quality, because Cagliari play very aggressive football.\u201d  Updated at 2.34pm GMT    2.25pm    PSV are currently second in the Eredivisie, two points behind Ajax, who were knocked out of the Champions League by Benfica this week. It\u2019s a tricky draw for Leicester but definitely a winnable tie. And the reward would be a semi-final against Bod\u00f8/Glimt or Roma. Feel free to email me your reaction, Foxes fans.     2.16pm   Conference League quarter-final and semi-final draw  QF1: Bod\u00f8/Glimt v RomaQF2: Feyenoord v Slavia PragueQF3: Marseille v PAOKQF4: Leicester City v PSV Eindhoven SF1: Leicester City or PSV Eindhoven v Bod\u00f8/Glimt or RomaSF2: Feyenoord or Slavia Prague v Marseille or PAOK The winners of semi-final 1 will be the \u2018home\u2019 team in the final, in Tirana on 25 May.

The group results in the group were 2-2 and 6-1 to Bod\u00f8/Glimt!  Updated at 2.14pm GMT    2.08pm    I attended Leicester\u2019s Europa League draw at home against Napoli last September. For one reason or another, that feels like a very long time ago. Anyway, the Foxes can still win European silverware this season, and that is not to be sniffed at.

Hello everyone. I\u2019m logged into the Uefa website and ready to roll ... and the Conference League draw is starting now.     1.58pm    It\u2019s coming up to 2pm which means two things. First, I\u2019m handing the blog back to Luke McLaughlin. Second, it\u2019s the Europa Conference League draw. Over to you Luke.     1.50pm    Former West Ham midfielder Joe Cole has given his thoughts to BT Sport on the Hammers being paired with Lyon in the Europa League quarter-finals. \u201cI\u2019m absolutely delighted. It could have been the glamour tie against Barcelona, and I think Rangers got the plum tie with Braga. \u201cBut I think Lyon are struggling in France. They\u2019re not what they were, and with the carrot of a Barcelona semi-final it sets it up lovely. \u201cIt\u2019s a lovely place to go. Brilliant stadium, history, and the West Ham fans would be booking their trip already I would imagine.\u201d Lyon currently sit 10th in Ligue 1 although they\u2019ve had a point deducted and are only two points behind sixth-placed Lille.     1.44pm    Here\u2019s our full story of the Europa League draw. Dates7 April: Quarter-finals, first legs14 April: Quarter-finals, second legs28 April: Semi-finals, first legs5 May: Semi-finals, second legs       1.35pm    Champions League quarter-final dates have been confirmed for Liverpool and Manchester City. They sit either side of the Premier League showdown between the two title contenders. Tuesday, 5 April: Benfica v Liverpool (8pm), Manchester City v Atl\u00e9tico Madrid (8pm). Sunday, 10 April: Manchester City v Liverpool (4.30pm). Wednesday, 13 April: Liverpool v Benfica (8pm), Atl\u00e9tico Madrid v Manchester City (8pm).     1.28pm    Back to domestic matters and Chelsea boss Thomas Tuchel has responded to being linked with Manchester United. What\u2019s your reaction, Thomas? \u201cThere\u2019s actually no reaction at all. Because do you feel me less committed to the club or less involved in the club in my situation? Absolutely not. \u201cI\u2019ve said many times that I love to be here, that I love to work for Chelsea and that this club has everything that it needs to make me happy. \u201cAnd that\u2019s why there\u2019s no need. And we have plenty of reasons to stay in the moment here, and this is what we do.\u201d Tuchel was also asked about the next owners of Chelsea, whoever they shall be. Chelsea\u2019s suitors have until end of business on Friday to submit bids after Roman Abramovich put the club up for sale. \u201cI\u2019m absolutely not involved, zero. I\u2019m informed from time to time, but we have a pretty tight schedule so I\u2019m happy not to be informed of every little step and chance in the process. \u201cBecause that gives me also the advantage to focus on football and the staff here, the environment I can influence, the 60 to 80 people here at Cobham. \u201cSo of course I\u2019m informed but not asked and it\u2019s also not necessary, it\u2019s not my job and not my role. Everybody hopes it will be completed quickly. And as I understand the hope is and we can trust this is maybe solved quicker than usual. \u201cBut it makes not so much sense to reflect how it would change with the role of a new owner, because the new owner is not here, the ideas are not set out. \u201cWe don\u2019t know what\u2019s coming, so let\u2019s cross the river when we are at the bridge. And right now we are not at the bridge.\u201d  Updated at 1.28pm GMT    1.18pm    A reminder that we\u2019re not done yet with pulling bits of paper out of little vending machine balls. Yep, at 2pm it\u2019s only the Europa Conference League draw. Meet the teams: Bod\u00f8/Glimt, Feyenoord, Leicester City, Marseille, PAOK, PSV Eindhoven, Roma, Slavia Prague.     1.10pm    A quick scan of the bookies after those two draws. Champions League2/1 Man City, Liverpool3/1 Bayern Munich11/1 Chelsea12/1 Real Madrid25/1 Atl\u00e9tico Madrid80/1 Villarreal150/1 Benfica In the Europa League, Barcelona are the 7/4 favourites, with West Ham 6/1 and Rangers 14/1.     1.03pm    A little surprised that Barcelona haven\u2019t been in a UEFA Cup/Europa League final before never mind won it. Most of the other obvious teams (Real Madrid, Liverpool, Bayern, Man Utd, Juventus, Inter, Ajax) have lifted the trophy. Spain (8) and England (2) have won the last 10 editions of the tournament between them.     12.56pm    West Ham and Rangers will think they have very winnable ties there. Just awaiting the exact dates.     12.48pm   Europa League quarter-final and semi-final draw  QF1: Leipzig v AtalantaQF2: Eintracht Frankfurt v BarcelonaQF3: West Ham v LyonQF4: Braga v Rangers SF1: Leipzig or Atalanta v Braga or RangersSF2: West Ham or Lyon v Eintracht Frankfurt or Barcelona The winners of SF2 will be the \u2018home\u2019 team in the final.  Updated at 12.54pm GMT    12.44pm    Braga v Rangers is quarter-final four.      12.43pm    West Ham v Lyon is the third quarter-final.      12.42pm    Eintracht Frankfurt v Barcelona is the second quarter-final. The Germans are the only previous winners (1980).      12.41pm    Leipzig v Atalanta is the first quarter-final.     12.39pm    Here we go...     12.39pm    Former Sevilla goalkeeper Andres Palop is doing the draw. Sevilla is host city for the final and Palop is a three-time winner of the Europa League. They\u2019ve clearly thought this through.     12.34pm    Pedro Pinto is back, running us through the runners and riders. Could it be West Ham v Barcelona in the last eight?      12.27pm    Europa League draw coming up very soon. On the official uefa.com website, they\u2019re running a \u201cWho will win?\u201d poll. Barcelona (45%) clear but Rangers (21%) have just edged in front of West Ham (20%). Atalanta next (5%).     12.21pm    Liverpool v Benfica will surely be billed as this in both countries. A proud day for Carlisle United. Fun fact: I was once played in an U15s match against Steve Harkness\u2019 old school. They beat us 9-0. They were good.      12.11pm    Champions League draw: A look at the English club\u2019s quarter-final opponents (from PA Media). Real Madrid \u2013 Chelsea\u2019s opponents The Champions League holders take on the kings of the competition in the quarter-finals. Real Madrid have been crowned continental champions on a record 13 occasions, currently sit atop of LaLiga and secured this tie by knocking out star-studded Paris St Germain in stunning fashion. Having lost 1-0 in France and gone down further to another Kylian Mbappe goal in the second leg, Karim Benzema\u2019s hat-trick secured a remarkable comeback and 3-2 aggregate triumph. Atl\u00e9tico Madrid \u2013 Manchester City\u2019s opponents The three-time competition runners-up return to Manchester for a fascinating clash against Manchester City in the final eight. Diego Simeone\u2019s men won LaLiga last season but have long since been out of the title race this time around, although they have picked up form of late and managed to knock out Manchester United in the last 16. Wily, well-drilled Atleti followed up a 1-1 first-leg draw in Spain by securing a 1-0 win at Old Trafford on Tuesday as the hosts were stifled. Benfica \u2013 Liverpool\u2019s opponents Having surprisingly emerged from a group including Bayern Munich and Barcelona, caretaker boss Nelson Verissimo masterminded a memorable last-16 win against Ajax. The sides drew 2-2 in the first leg in Lisbon and Benfica dug deep in Amsterdam to eke out a 1-0 triumph through Darwin Nunez\u2019s late header. The Uruguay international is the star of a side enjoying a fine Champions League run during a season when their Primeira Liga hopes are already over.     12.04pm    Thanks Luke. While we await that draw, it\u2019s full steam ahead for coincidences and omens.  Memories of Howard Gayle, Ray Kennedy and Alan Kennedy. Liverpool also won the League Cup in 1981. It\u2019s clearly in the stars.      12.00pm    My colleague David Tindall will be guiding you through the upcoming Europa League draw, and I\u2019ll be back for more later today.     11.56am    Russia\u2019s participation in the World Cup in Qatar has almost certainly been ruled out after a move to delay their suspension while an appeal was heard was rejected. Football\u2019s world governing body, Fifa, suspended the Russian federation from its competitions over the country\u2019s invasion of Ukraine at the end of February.  Russia appealed to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) and asked that the suspension be stayed pending the outcome of the appeal. However, CAS announced on Friday that the Russian request for a stay had been rejected and that the suspension remained in force. Russia were due to compete in the World Cup play-offs later this month, but with no date fixed for the appeal to be heard it would seem that they are out of contention for the finals.

The Portuguese side were very impressive in winning against Ajax the other night. Nicolas Otamendi and Jan Vertonghen were both exceptional in central defence in a classic backs-to-the-wall European away performance. But you would definitely fancy Liverpool to be more clinical with their finishing than the Dutch side were. \u201cI am delighted that we got Benfica,\u201d chimes in Bilal, another Liverpool fan.

Arteta sarcastically said \u201cthank you to the Premier League\u201d and claimed it was \u201cnot fair\u201d that the Gunners have to travel to Aston Villa on Saturday lunchtime having been in action against Liverpool on Wednesday night.  The Spaniard said: \u201cI do because I am talking about the Premier League. I\u2019m complaining how we schedule the games in the Premier League. When you are in Europe it\u2019s a different story. We are the only team that is scheduled like that.\u201d Arteta is unsure whether Takehiro Tomiyasu will be fit for the visit to Villa Park. The Japanese right-back missed the game against Liverpool with an injury and will be assessed after training today. \u201cThere is a chance, but we don\u2019t know.

We live in hope that another redraw will not be necessary. The FA Cup quarter-finals will also unfold across the weekend and on top of that, there\u2019s a Premier League game tonight, and another four top-flight league fixtures over the weekend. Plus Championship and EFL fixtures and plenty of action across the continent, too. And of course there\u2019s the ongoing drama of Chelsea, Roman Abramovich and the potential sale of the club following sanctions from the government: the deadline for potential buyers to submit bids is 9pm tonight. It\u2019s all happening.  "

                    "body": "First, she won races that no female jockey had won before. Next, she crossed off career-defining achievements for any rider, in any generation. And on Saturday, when she rides Minella Times in the Grand National at Aintree, Rachael Blackmore could move on to the once-a-century stuff.\nTony McCoy, in 1997, was the last jockey before Blackmore to win the Champion Hurdle and Gold Cup at the same Cheltenham Festival, so it is 25 years since there has been any need to delve through National Hunt\u2019s history books, to confirm whether a jockey has ever won the Grand National too in the same season.\nGo right back to the sport\u2019s earliest days, when the Champion Hurdle itself was in its infancy, and you will find that the answer is one: Tommy Cullinan, in 1930, who completed the set of jumping\u2019s crown jewels at Aintree on Shaun Goilin, a chance ride after his original mount, the great Easter Hero, picked up an injury.\n\nNinety-two years later, and in a far more competitive era, Blackmore is nine-and-a-half minutes away from completing a quickfire treble that has eluded National Hunt\u2019s greatest riders ever since. And if Minella Times can reprise his winning performance 12 months ago \u2013 becoming only the fourth dual winner since 1899 in the process \u2013 a full house of 70,000 spectators will be at Aintree to give horse and rider the reception they deserve.\nIt was an eerie and, in all honesty, a somewhat deflating experience to witness Blackmore\u2019s historic success in front of empty grandstands 12 months ago. More than any other race, the Grand National is about the shared experience, for those at the course and the hundreds of millions watching around the world. Without the noise and delirious excitement that takes over as the 40 runners line up for the most intense 10 minutes of action in any sport, it could only be a pale imitation of an event that has captured the public\u2019s imagination for the best part of 200 years.\nBlackmore, of course, was too caught up in the moment, the one that every jump jockey has dreamed about since childhood, to allow the near-silence to rub the polish from her day. But it left a faint sense of unfinished business that would be consigned to history with a victory on Saturday.\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to imagine what winning it again would feel like until it actually happens, to be honest,\u201d Blackmore said this week. \u201cMy mum and sister are coming over on Saturday morning and they\u2019re really looking forward to it, so it will be great to have them here and there are plenty of friends as well that are coming too.\n\n\u201cYou just can\u2019t compare that feeling of crossing the line, it was just a phenomenal feeling and it\u2019s a race that every kid wants to ride in. When you\u2019re growing up, this is the race that captures your imagination and it\u2019s just very special to be able to say that you\u2019ve won it. I\u2019ve definitely seen the replay of last year\u2019s race more times than I can count.\n\u201cThere\u2019s definitely a massive global reach and I really felt that after last year. The media attention after Cheltenham last year [where Blackmore was the first female rider to finish as the meeting\u2019s top jockey] was massive, but after the Grand National it just seemed to explode again. It seems to reach parts of the world that no other races do.\u201d\nLast month\u2019s success in the Cheltenham Gold Cup meant that Blackmore is now the only current jockey in the weighing room to have won the Big Three races, and she completed the set in little more than a year. That tells the story of her career as a whole, the years spent struggling for a breakthrough before multiple Grade One winners arrived one after another at a dizzying pace. Blackmore could be unseated at the first on Saturday and remain a global sporting phenomenon.\n\n\u201cWhen you go into a random clothes shop in Dublin and you\u2019re dressed in normal clothes and someone comes up to you, that is mad,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s one thing people coming up to you at the races because you\u2019re dressed like a jockey and people can place you, but the odd time you\u2019re in a situation like that is something that didn\u2019t happen 12 months ago.\n\u201cI\u2019ve got loads of fanmail since last year, from both girls and boys. A lot of times I know the teacher in school is setting out an assignment of writing to someone you admire as I get a bundle of letters, so it\u2019s obviously on the school curriculum somewhere. It\u2019s brilliant and it\u2019s great that it\u2019s sparking an interest in kids, and hopefully that helps them.\u201d\n\nThis being the National, of course, there are other storylines to fire the punters\u2019 imagination, not least the possibility that Snow Leopardess, a magnificent front-running grey, will become the first mare to win the race after becoming a mother.\nMarietta Fox-Pitt, her 80-year-old owner and breeder, would be a captivating post-race interviewee, retelling the story of the injury that threatened to end her horse\u2019s career, the decision to send her to be covered by a Derby winner while recuperating, and the lifelong horsewoman\u2019s insistence that having children had made no difference to her and so should make no difference to Snow Leopardess either.\nSnow Leopardess should be impossible to miss at the head of the field. Picking out Blackmore\u2019s green-and-yellow cap, distinguishing her among JP McManus\u2019s five runners, will be more of a challenge, but millions will be following her every step of the way as she attempts to carve out another piece of history. For Blackmore, the mission in this year\u2019s Grand National is simple. Once more, with people."

                    "body": "Russia has resumed critical gas supplies to Europe through Germany, reopening the Nord Stream gas pipeline after 10 days, albeit at a lower capacity. But will this be enough to resolve the pressing energy worries of Germany and the wider continent? How reliant is Germany on Russian gas? Natural gas makes up about 27% of Germany\u2019s overall energy mix. Before the start of Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine, just over half (55%) of gas consumed in Germany was imported from Russia. Since Russia invaded Ukraine at the end of February, the German government has scrambled to source gas from elsewhere, for example by buying more natural gas from Norway or the Netherlands, or by expanding its infrastructure for importing liquefied natural gas (LNG) from the US and Qatar. As of the end of June, Germany is only reliant on Russian imports for about a quarter of its gas needs. This last quarter, however, is required in areas where Germany is particularly vulnerable: to heat private homes and to power the industry of the EU\u2019s largest economy. In both of those areas, gas is the single largest source of energy, at about 37% of the overall mix. Why is German reliance on Russian gas causing so much anguish? Currently, very little gas is flowing from Russia to Germany through any of the three pipelines that connect the two countries. The Russian state-owned gas giant Gazprom in May ceased deliveries through the Yamal pipeline passing through Belarus and Poland, while the Ukraine-transiting Transgas, an extension of the Soyuz pipeline from Russia, is prioritising deliveries to Slovakia and Austria. Germany\u2019s most important pipeline, Nord Stream 1, used to carry up to 170m cubic metres of gas a day. But in mid-June Gazprom reduced its deliveries to about 40m cubic metres a day, citing the delayed \u201crepair\u201d of a turbine by the German company Siemens.  On 11 July, Nord Stream closed down for 10 days for scheduled maintenance works, but the assumption in Germany was that Putin would use the break as a pretext to stop gas exports altogether, with reference to further pretend technical issues. A government spokesperson said on Wednesday that the turbine under discussion was a replacement part not due to be put to use until September anyway, and thus could not explain the drastic throttling of deliveries. On Thursday morning, the company behind Nord Stream 1 announced that gas was flowing through its pipeline once more, although the head of Germany\u2019s federal network agency said Gazprom had said gas would resume only at 30% of its original capacity.  Will Germany run out of gas this winter? If Gazprom resumes gas deliveries at 40% of the capacity before the maintenance break, Germany will narrowly scrape through the winter without shortages, modelling by the Kiel Institute for the World Economy suggests. Since Germany has rushed to fill its gas reserves in the first half of the year \u2013 ironically buying more gas from Russia than usual in spite of economic sanctions \u2013 it is expected to avoid being forced into rationing. It would, however, enter the winter of 2023-24 in a considerably worse situation than this year. In a worst-case scenario where Germany can\u2019t get more gas and also fails to make savings, the institute predicts damage to the economy of up to \u20ac283bn (\u00a3241.5bn). Either way, there will be pressure on Germany to reduce its gas consumption significantly in the coming months. According to calculations by the Brussels-based economic policy thinktank Bruegel, Germany would have to find reductions of almost 30%, or 20% if it manages to complete two floating LNG terminals in the North Sea ports of Wilhelmshaven and Brunsb\u00fcttel by the start of next year, as planned.  If there are shortages, how will rationing work? Under current plans, private households would be protected from gas rationing along with other \u201cprotected\u201d customers such as care homes or hospitals. The brunt of reductions would have to be made by German industry, accountable for about a third of the country\u2019s gas use. Yet in recent weeks voices from the chemical and pharmaceutical industries have argued that rationing their sector could set off domino effects with catastrophic consequences for the entire economy, and the energy minister, Robert Habeck, has said private households would also need to \u201cplay their part\u201d. Monitoring radiator use or rationing the individual gas supply to millions of private homes would be technically impossible, however, and a more likely outcome is that the government would try to force consumers into making savings through higher bills. How did Germany end up in this dilemma? Both Olaf Scholz\u2019s government and that of his predecessor Angela Merkel identified natural gas as an essential \u201cbridge technology\u201d on the path to a renewable energy future. The war in Ukraine, however, is threatening to tear down that bridge. Germany is due to shut down its last three remaining nuclear power plants by the end of the year, a decision announced by Merkel after an earthquake triggered an accident at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant in 2011, but one whose groundwork had been laid by the previous Social Democrat-Green coalition government in 2000. To meet carbon-reduction targets it is also planning to exit coal power by 2038 at the latest, and, if possible by 2035. The buildup of renewable energy sources, which accelerated massively at the start of the 2010s, has slowed down in recent years. With the exit dates set, and Germany having incrementally liberalised its energy market since the late 1990s, the economy grew increasingly reliant on Russian gas, which was not only cheap but also satisfied a political desire in some German political circles for knitting closer diplomatic ties with Moscow. Couldn\u2019t Germany just reactivate its nuclear power plants? The three remaining power stations \u2013 two in the south and one in the north \u2013 make up only 5% of Germany\u2019s electricity mix. The government says expanding their lifespan would offer little reward and come attached with considerable risk. The plants, said Habeck recently, were set up now so their fuel rods would be burnt up by the end of the year. To extend them, they would need to go into a saver mode that would also produce less energy. Extending them for a few years rather than months would require purchasing new fuel rods and safety inspections that are already two years overdue. Not carrying out such inspections, Habeck warned, would turn Germany\u2019s nuclear plants into prime targets for potential cyber-attacks. Nuclear industry spokespeople, however, say the safety inspections could be carried out without having to wind down the plants in the meantime. Pro-nuclear voices also point out that Germany\u2019s electricity needs will grow over the coming years as the country switches to renewable sources of energy: the thinktank Agora Energiewende expects Germany to double its electricity requirements to 1,000 terawatt hours by 2045. Habeck, a Green party politician, said he would assess the situation around nuclear energy \u201cwithout taboos\u201d, but a U-turn on the issue harbours potential for an enormous loss of face for the environmental party, which grew out of the anti-nuclear movement of the 1980s. What about the rest of Europe? Russia accounted for about two-fifths of the EU\u2019s gas needs before the start of the war in Ukraine. The EU committed in March to reducing gas imports from Russia by two-thirds within a year, but has failed to establish a consensus on an outright import ban amid fears of economic knock-on effects in several states."

Palace made a request for the 22-year-old to be allowed to play but the rules of the loan will prevent him from lining up against last season\u2019s Cup finalists.\n\nTuchel said: \u201cI believe Conor can be a part of our squad and can play a role with us. But I am not the only one to decide. We need to speak after the season with everybody, speak after the season about what Conor wants, we need to see what the situation is and what role we have for him that he can fight for.\n\u201cThere needs to be something to fight, a role and perspective of where you are, where you can be, what you need to achieve. So we have to be very clear with him and he needs to be clear with us. Then we will sort it out. His development is extraordinary and outstanding.\n\u201cHe is one of the key players at Crystal Palace and made a huge step in his development up front. He was a pleasure to coach in pre-season \u2013 he has so much positive energy, energy in general, and such work rate to give that he can have a big influence.\u201d\n\nGallagher has scored eight goals this season and provided five assists, with the attacking midfielder helping Palace climb into the top half of the Premier League and reach the semi-final. The Chelsea academy graduate\u2019s form resulted in his England debut in November and he made his first international start in last month\u2019s friendly win against Switzerland.\nTuchel bumped into Gallagher recently and the Chelsea manager understood the midfielder\u2019s frustration at being denied the opportunity to make an impression at Wembley.\n\n\u201cI had the chance to speak to Conor, and I could also see his frustration,\u201d Tuchel said. \u201cWe met some weeks ago; after the international break by coincidence we ran into each other in a restaurant, and we had a chat. The subject came up, and I apologised because I know how competitive he is and I like him a lot.\n\u201cI know his character very well \u2026 This is the way it is. We play to win the game, and the rules were clear when we made the loan. I can totally understand Patrick Vieira and the disappointment of Conor but these are the rules when we did the loan, and we don\u2019t want to suffer from our rules.\u201d\nChelsea will have Romelu Lukaku available with the striker returning to training after missing the games at Southampton and Real Madrid."

An independent panel has ruled Worcester could have done more to field a team despite several squad members being unavailable because of illness and injury.\nThe Warriors pulled out of the game citing a lack of tighthead props and Gloucester were subsequently awarded a 20-0 \u201cvictory\u201d and five league points. Following the release of the full reasoned judgment by Sport Resolutions UK, however, the Gloucester chief executive, Lance Bradley, has made clear the club do not consider the matter entirely closed.\n\n\u201cWe are pleased the independent panel rejected Worcester\u2019s claims that the cancellation was due to Covid-19 and that they did everything they could to field a team,\u201d Bradley said. \u201cAs is evident in the report, clearly neither of these things was the case. The club will now seek compensation from Worcester Warriors through the relevant channels.\u201d\nWhile a Worcester official did approach other Premiership club team managers via WhatsApp to request assistance in finding spare props at short notice, the panel found that no phone calls were made and concluded the club had not tried hard enough to obtain loan cover, causing major inconvenience to the home side Gloucester.\n\u201cThe impact of Worcester\u2019s decision to cancel the match was significant across the club and amongst both sets of fans, not least due to doing so within only a few hours of the scheduled kick-off,\u201d Bradley said. \n\u201cIt was frustrating for both sets of fans who had been looking forward to a good game of live rugby, whether at Kingsholm or live on BT Sport, and it was frustrating for our players, coaches and other staff who had been working hard to prepare for the game.\n\u201cWe refunded all match ticket holders, season-ticket holders, box holders and hospitality guests; all of which resulted in significant financial loss for the club. There were also huge financial damages incurred through lost food and drinks sales, not only for Gloucester Rugby, but also for numerous establishments around the city.\u201d\n\nNext year, meanwhile, the European Champions\u2019 Cup will not feature the two-leg home-and-away round of 16 which proved a popular innovation this season. Instead the tournament is to span eight weekends rather than nine, with only four pool rounds before the top eight sides from two pools advance to the knockout stages.\nThe last 16 will now comprise a one-off fixture and it is understood the tournament will once again comprise 24 clubs. South Africa\u2019s leading provincial teams are expected to be involved for the first time, with a formal announcement of the competition structure due on the eve of this season\u2019s finals in Marseille on 27 and 28 May."

                    "body": "\u201cDon\u2019t you sit in our chair.\u201d It was just a moment in the middle of the madness, another picture of a wild, epic night with all its drama and its silliness too, but David Alaba had summed it up somehow. As the Santiago Bernab\u00e9u lost its collective mind on Wednesday and Karim Benzema slipped to his knees, fists clenched, the Austrian picked up a white plastic chair and raised it triumphantly to the sky. Iconic and, when he chose to caption it, symbolic too: you don\u2019t just unseat Real Madrid. \u201cWe\u2019re the Kings of Europe!\u201d the banner had declared before the game; by the end of it, they were singing the same line, still there, still unmoved, the state unable to overthrow them, the significance of this meeting made all the more profound by the power battle that divides these clubs. For Paris Saint-Germain, the European Cup has become an obsession that deepens with every year that passes, like this one will, without them winning it. By the time the club were founded, Real Madrid had six of them. Since the Qataris took over, Madrid have won four.  Some things money can\u2019t buy, at least not yet \u2013 and not just the trophy. Frustration at that, a feeling of injustice and impotence, was expressed when the PSG owner, Naseer Al-Khelaifi left the directors box to confront the referee after the game, in scenes Monica Marchante, the Spanish TV reporter who witnessed them, described as \u201cfrankly unpleasant\u201d. Real Madrid have 13 European Cups. Theirs is a history, an identity built on the implausible that is partly self-perpetuating. There is something there. \u201cMagic,\u201d their manager, Carlo Ancelotti, called it. \u201cHistory matters, history plays,\u201d the former Madrid winger M\u00edchel says. \u201cNo one knows why but when you pull on that Real Madrid shirt you become a mini Incredible Hulk.\u201d That poses the question: what is the opposite of a mini Incredible Hulk? Because he was also there. It matters, M\u00edchel says, that opponents know Madrid\u2019s history. Jorge Valdano, a former general manager at Madrid, came up with two concepts that were played out again: stage fright and football as an estado de \u00e1nimo, a state of mind, an emotional condition. Gianluigi Donnarumma\u2019s dreadful mistake \u201ctotally changed the game, totally changed the atmosphere in the stadium\u201d, Ancelotti said, the Bernab\u00e9u suddenly smelling blood and PSG all too aware it was theirs.  They hadn\u2019t been in it until then, but suddenly Madrid knew and PSG knew. \u201cA club that has 13 European Cups doesn\u2019t win by chance; it\u2019s something deep in their guts,\u201d Mauricio Pochettino said before the game. Now, his PSG team crumpled before his eyes. It is not the first time. Madrid were in their area three times in the three minutes after the first goal. The ball was in play for 12seconds between the second goal and the third. The opening goal had transformed everything. \u201cWe were the better team and it\u2019s so disappointing that the motion of the game changed because of this situation and it\u2019s so difficult because you give Real Madrid the belief and you\u2019re at the Bernab\u00e9u,\u201d Pochettino said. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult to manage this situation and the team was so affected.\u201d If it was worth asking why the impact was quite so great, why PSG were so fragile, so incapable of resisting the changing tide, and what that says about them, their coach preferred to focus on how it had happened in the first place. On the moment that promoted the collapse: as far as he was concerned, Benzema had fouled Donnarumma. As far as the keeper was concerned as well. \u201cIt\u2019s not an error because it\u2019s a clear foul,\u201d he said. \u201cI have seen the footage 30 or 40 times from all angles. Small details count and the VAR didn\u2019t see a decisive foul.\u201d Big details count too, broader, almost intangible elements that make these clubs different. This was hard for PSG to accept and their coach didn\u2019t. When BT\u2019s Phil Kitromilides opened his post-match interview with, \u201cMauricio, it\u2019s hard to explain what happened,\u201d the former Spurs manager shot back, almost trembling: \u201cNo, no, it\u2019s not difficult. It\u2019s so clear. To concede the goal we conceded it\u2019s unbelievable. It\u2019s impossible to accept.\u201d  \u201cIt\u2019s so unfair to talk about different things because that changed completely the way the game was \u2026 complete, complete, changed the motion, changed everything and after we do some mistakes but when something very, very unfair happens it is difficult for the players to keep calm on the pitch.\u201d Off the pitch was no easier. At the full-time whistle, Al-Khelaifi \u2013 not just PSG\u2019s owner but the president of the European Club Association \u2013 was furious, hitting walls and shouting. He headed to the referee\u2019s room, or what he thought was the referee\u2019s room, only to come across the former referee Meg\u00eda D\u00e1vila, who is Madrid\u2019s match-day delegate. When he did encounter the match referee, Danny Makkelie, the confrontation continued and he broke the linesman\u2019s flag, according to the official\u2019s formal report. Sources at Madrid said security had to be called and that Al-Khelaifi turned on a member of staff who was recording the scene on his phone, shouting: \u201cI\u2019ll kill you.\u201d Leonardo, PSG\u2019s sporting director, then allegedly demanded the recording be deleted, yet another image they would rather not be confronted with again.  Defeat hurt, another opportunity gone, and it was hard to avoid the conclusion that the one really, really good thing they have will soon be gone: in front of his parents, who were invited to the Bernab\u00e9u by the hosts, Kylan Mbapp\u00e9 gave another superb performance before fans who are already applauding him and who trust that he will soon be wearing their shirt. History plays there, too, and so does this stadium, the magic that gripped them all. Which is another reason why it wasn\u2019t just this year\u2019s European Cup that felt like it slipped from PSG\u2019s grasp, Real Madrid\u2019s seat still not for sitting in."

                    "body": "When Matty Peet accepted the job he had worked his entire adult life towards not even he could have envisaged that in his 17th match as a head coach he would be leading out his hometown club, Wigan, in the Challenge Cup final. But that is now the reality for Peet, who has worked his way up from coaching Westhoughton Lions\u2019 under-12s to the biggest job in the game.\nProbably no club is more synonymous with the Challenge Cup than Wigan and Peet, who has attended finals at Wembley as a supporter and member of the club\u2019s backroom staff, now takes the lead role, albeit at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium on 28 May. The young group of players he has transformed in a matter of months were worthy winners at Elland Road as they survived an almighty comeback from their great rivals, St Helens.\n\u201cWe will go and create some memories together,\u201d Peet said after Liam Marshall\u2019s late try decided a thrilling semi-final. \u201cWe knew the prize at the end of this was huge but I\u2019ve got so much trust in this group.\u201d\nHis side executed their gameplan to perfection in a one-sided first half, establishing a 14-0 lead through tries from Marshall, Cade Cust and Liam Farrell.\nAt that stage the prospect of a St Helens comeback seemed unthinkable. The reigning Challenge Cup holders were off-colour and their half-back, Jonny Lomax, was carrying an injury that was clearly affecting his play.\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t apply ourselves in that first half and we didn\u2019t have the resolve we usually do,\u201d said their coach, Kristian Woolf .\nMarshall crossed for an early opener, Cust dummied his way across from close range and then Farrell pounced on a slip from Lomax to make it 14-0. \nSt Helens had to score first after half-time to stand any chance. But even when they did, courtesy of Konrad Hurrell\u2019s try, they still had an immense amount of work to do.\nOn the following set Lomax capitalised on a pass from Tommy Makinson to narrow the deficit to two points, with Makinson converting both tries in the blink of an eye.\nAs the hour mark approached, St Helens\u2019 talismanic captain, James Roby, moved them ahead for the first time as he stretched out to ground the ball under pressure from two defenders.\nIt was a familiar feeling, the all-conquering Saints seemingly getting back on course and booking their passage to another final. But this time, for once, the outcome was markedly different.\nIt was perhaps cruel that Lomax, who was integral to the fightback and will play on for the rest of the season with a ruptured , was involved in the play that led to Wigan\u2019s winning try. His errant pass went to ground and Marshall had the wherewithal to collect and outpace Makinson to the line, diving under the posts to give Harry Smith a simple conversion and nudge Wigan back ahead.\n\nThere have been any number of late St Helens comebacks but there was a different feel to proceedings this time. Wigan held them at bay, sparking wild scenes among the supporters and players at the final hooter.\nAppointing Peet, without a senior head coaching role to his name, was widely viewed as a gamble by Wigan supporters over the winter. That gamble already looks to have paid off in a matter of months."

                    "body": "J\u00fcrgen Klopp believes Manchester City did not see the best of Liverpool on Sunday and could face a sterner challenge when the rivals meet again in Saturday\u2019s FA Cup semi-final. The Liverpool manager made seven changes from the 2-2 draw at the Etihad Stadium for Wednesday\u2019s Champions League quarter-final second leg against Benfica, while City survived a bruising encounter at Atl\u00e9tico Madrid, including 12 minutes of stoppage time, before also reaching the semi-finals. Klopp disputes that the contrast in preparations will enhance Liverpool\u2019s prospects at Wembley, but he expects improvement from his team regardless because, in his opinion, they fell short in several departments in the Premier League encounter.  Klopp said: \u201cWe had it last week before we played City. We had an away game [in Lisbon] and arrived home in the middle of the next day. Travelling is intense, definitely. Will it give us at advantage? I have no idea. \u201cWe will see. It was for both teams intense [on Wednesday]. City was really strong last week and we were not at our best, so I would like to see a game where we are at our best as well. That would be interesting. \u201cThe boys did a lot of good stuff in the game, but I really think in a couple of positions we are able to perform on a completely different level and I think we should give that a try. And it\u2019s a Cup game, a one-off. If it\u2019s 2-2 again, it\u2019s 120 minutes and if it stays like that it\u2019s penalties and that would be really crazy if it goes all the way. \u201cI want to have 12 games from now until the end of the season and be in the finals. It\u2019s tough but it\u2019s still the best schedule to have because it means you are in all the competitions as long as possible. I\u2019m really looking forward to the game. Wembley is a big pitch, we have to cover a lot of grass and run a lot and close big gaps, but I think it will be cool.\u201d  Diogo Jota is Liverpool\u2019s only fitness concern, although Klopp expects the Portugal international to recover from the knock sustained against Benfica. Klopp admits he and Pep Guardiola have made tactical changes to stifle each other in recent years, but not at the expense of quality entertainment. \u201cOver the years you notice changes,\u201d he said. \u201cWe had some decent counterattacks in the past and then Pep decided full-backs couldn\u2019t go past the halfway line. We did similar things, we try to deny them as well. Sometimes it works and sometimes it does not.  \u201cThere are decisive challenges in a game and you better win them otherwise they are in a really good position. We lost a couple of easy balls in the City game a few days ago and what they made of it was spectacular, like the counter in the first minute when Ali [Alisson] made a great save from [Raheem] Sterling. It\u2019s just good football, but the goals we scored were really good situations as well. \u201cIt\u2019s a really intense fight on a really high level. The concentration levels that all the boys have to bring on to the pitch is insane. When tactical things match each other it can be tactically really interesting, but horribly boring for the neutral. That rarely happens in games between City and Liverpool and that\u2019s good for all the fans who watch.\u201d"

Feted as English football\u2019s youngest chief executive after joining Barnsley for a spell in 2018 at the age of 30, Ganaye spent last season juggling his role at Nancy with being executive president of the Belgian club KV Oostende. Barnsley, who were relegated from the Championship in April despite reaching the playoffs last year, are, like Nancy and Oostende, part-owned by New City Capital \u2013 an investment group that also includes American investors Pacific Media Group. \u201cThe starting brief was never that I\u2019d be there 100% of the time,\u201d said Ganaye of his dual roles. \u201cDiscussions are under way in order to define a structure that can allow all of the clubs in the group to function.\u201d  Things were not much better on the pitch for the rest of New City Capital\u2019s steadily growing portfolio of clubs. Thun \u2013 who won the domestic title as recently as 2010 \u2013 laboured to a mid-table finish in Switzerland\u2019s second tier, fans of Esbjerg endured another season of frustration in Denmark\u2019s second division and Den Bosch remain marooned in the Dutch second tier. At least the investors had something to celebrate at the end of May when Kaiserslautern \u2013 the four-times German champions who sold a 10% stake to a US consortium consisting of New City Capital\u2019s Chien Lee and Pacific Media Group\u2019s Paul Conway in March \u2013 beat Dynamo Dresden in the promotion playoffs to return to Germany\u2019s second tier for the first time since 2018. From New City Capital and 777 Partners LLC to City Football Group (CFG), Bolt Football Holdings, Redbird Capital and Red Bull, owning one club doesn\u2019t seem to be enough these days. Even Saudi Arabia\u2019s Public Investment Fund, fresh from its controversial takeover of Newcastle, is getting in on the act with speculation it is in contention to buy the Polish club Slask Wroclaw despite strong local opposition.  \u201cSilesia is ancestral silver,\u201d said Wroclaw\u2019s local government spokesperson, Wojciech Koerber, last week. \u201cThe history of this city is not something that can be sold for a few zlotys. It is not only a business project, but also a social one.\u201d There are strong whispers that Qatar Sports Investments \u2013 which has transformed Paris Saint-Germain into a European superpower thanks to its endless financial reserves \u2013 is attempting to build a portfolio of clubs after watching the majority Abu Dhabi-owned CFG take its expanding empire into double figures with the acquisition of the French club Troyes in 2020. CFG failed in an attempt to buy Breda in April after a furious backlash from fans of the Dutch club. \u201cI won\u2019t be surprised if QSI buys a club in Portugal soon,\u201d one source says. \u201cThey have seen how successful CFG have been in running so many different clubs around the world that they all want to do the same. The system has been refined by CFG but the idea was started by the Pozzos.\u201d  The Pozzos \u2013 the Italian owners of Udinese and Watford \u2013 relinquished control of their stake in Granada in 2016 after seven years at the helm of the Spanish side. The multi-club phenomenon can be traced back much further, to a landmark case at the court of arbitration for sport in 2000 regarding two stakes owned by Enic, the company through which the English businessman Joe Lewis later bought Tottenham. The court\u2019s ruling over Enic\u2019s minority shareholding in AEK Athens and its majority one in Slavia Prague led to the introduction of regulations that prohibited two clubs in which a person or company had \u201cdecisive influence\u201d from being admitted into the same Uefa club competition. With different rules in place for every domestic league, however, a pretty big loophole remains open. Whereas the Premier League has restricted shareholding in a second club in the division to 10%, Uefa\u2019s integrity rules permit one person to have a 100% shareholding in one club and a \u201cnon-decisive influence\u201d shareholding in another club competing in the same competition.  There were questions asked in Germany when the American investor David Blitzer \u2013 who owns a 40% share in Crystal Palace through his company Bolt Football Holdings \u2013 bought 45% of the company that owns a majority shareholding in Augsburg at the start of 2021. But with the club membership retaining 50+1 of the voting shares, they have remained on the right side of the regulations and finished the season well clear of relegation trouble after January\u2019s club-record signing of the America forward Ricardo Pepi in a deal worth $18m. That has not been the only triumph for Blitzer, who was also behind Martin Broughton\u2019s failed bid for Chelsea last month that, if successful, would have meant relinquishing his Palace shares. His Dutch club, Den Haag, missed out on promotion to the Eredivisie in the playoffs and his Belgian team, Waasland-Beveren, came close to returning to the top flight, six years after relegation. Bolt Football Holdings has also emerged as the likely new owner of the 10-times French champions Saint-\u00c9tienne after their relegation to Ligue 2 amid dramatic scenes in their playoff against Auxerre. RedBird \u2013 another American investment vehicle, whose partners include the Liverpool owners John Henry and Tom Werner, the NFL and LeBron James \u2013 followed up its success in guiding Toulouse back to Ligue 1 by completing the purchase of the Milan, the Italian champions, for $1.3bn.  The Miami-based 777 will be hoping for similar returns after their 100% takeover of Standard Li\u00e8ge in March, having completed a $175.8m deal to buy Genoa in September. The sale made Standard \u2013 who have not won a domestic title since 2009 \u2013 the 10th club in Belgium\u2019s top flight to have attracted foreign investment, and almost half of Serie A\u2019s clubs have been sold to North American investors or consortiums since 2018. In February, 777 spent $137m on a 70% share in Vasco de Gama after legislation last year that permitted Brazilian clubs to operate as public companies opened the door to foreign investment. A month earlier, John Textor \u2013 the American who spent a reported \u00a387.5m to join Blitzer as a minority stakeholder at Palace in August after showing interest in Newcastle \u2013 had taken a 90% stake in Botafogo and he says he is intent on restoring the glory years at the club where Jairzinho and Garrincha made their name. \u201cI want it to be clear three to five years from now that there is a Botafogo way,\u201d he said. \u201cFailure is the best teacher.\u201d"

The 30-year-old follows Georgia Stanway and Caroline Weir, and the back-up goalkeeper Karima Benameur Taieb, another whose deal is expiring, is also leaving.\nBronze rejoined City in 2020 after a spell with Lyon, having previously played for them from 2014 to 2017. She has made 111 appearances for the club, scoring 14 goals, and is poised to be part of England\u2019s Euro 2022 squad this summer. She was named Fifa Best Women\u2019s Player of the Year in 2020.\n\nStanway, another England international, has joined Bayern Munich on a three-year deal after making her City debut aged 16 in 2015. Weir has been linked with Real Madrid and is departing after making 124 appearances for City since joining from Liverpool in 2018. \nBronze, who missed the first half of this season after knee surgery, wrote on social media: \u201cIt\u2019s been great to spend the last two years back on home soil. Although it has come with trials and tribulations, it has also come with accomplishments. Big thanks to my teammates for being there for me. And of course, to our supporters: you\u2019ve been by our side no matter what and you\u2019re playing such an important role in pushing the women\u2019s game to the level we want it to be.\u201d"

The Merseyside team were looking to salvage something from a pretty disastrous season in which two managers have already come and gone \u2013 and they were also out for revenge for their extra-time Cup final defeat by City two seasons ago.        A Manchester City merchandise stall set up inside the Manchester City Academy Stadium (top), Manchester City fans, City mascots Moonbeam and Moonchester, fans queue for some pre-match sustenance, and visiting Everton fans.        Face painter Keeley Brown (top left) and a colleague at work. Injured club captain Steph Houghton makes her way to her seat before kick-off (above left). Houghton has been out of action since January after she aggravated the achilles injury that she sustained in September. Manchester City\u2019s captain Ellen White (right) leads the pre-match handshake.  Eager to make home advantage count, City came flying out of the blocks with Lucy Bronze (below) going close on a number of occasions. The home side had the lion\u2019s share of possession and opportunities in the first half which meant Everton\u2019s captain Izzy Christiansen, seen clearing the ball below, was kept busy as the visitors struggled throughout to build any sort of momentum against an impressive City side.    Lauren Hemp (above, fourth right) celebrates with teammates in the 35th minute after sweeping the ball home from close range before adding a superb second with a magnificent backheel flick early in the second half (below). Hemp\u2019s double meant that she had scored 14 goals in 29 appearances this season, and edged above Caroline Weir in the club\u2019s scoring charts with 37 in total.   Manchester City\u2019s Filippa Angeldahl (above left) races Everton\u2019s Gabrielle George to win the ball. Just after the hour mark Caroline Weir (below) surged forward before firing home City\u2019s third from 25 yards out for her sixth goal in as many games. It was her 12th in 26 appearances this season.   Manchester City\u2019s captain Ellen White (above) sealed the rout as she tapped in a cross during injury-time. The 4-0 victory meant City reached the last four for the eighth consecutive season. Filippa Angeldahl poses for a photo with a young fan after their victory and a City fan has their shirt signed by Georgia Stanway (below).     The draw gave Manchester City another away tie, their third in the four so far in this year\u2019s competition, as they travel to Chigwell to take on West Ham in the semi-finals.

                    "body": "IT\u2019S A KIND OF MAGIC\nIn much the same way that the Fiver used to be much better 20 years ago, so was the FA Cup final. The TV coverage would begin at 10am with TV reporters from BBC and ITV joining the players of both teams in their hotel dining rooms for breakfast, before travelling with them on their coaches to \u2026 er, the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff.\nIn those days, they\u2019d all be suited and booted for the day and viewers would be treated to footage of them playing cards, chatting, sitting frozen in nervous terror or listening to their Walkmans (ask your folks). Invariably, some luckless sod from each team that happened to be missing the game through injury would be roped into introducing assorted teammates he thought might up for a bit of performative \u201cbanter\u201d for the cameras. Then at 3pm, after hours of buildup the teams would kick off and 90 or 120 minutes later the famous old trophy would be handed over.\n\nIn the intervening years, it has not gone unnoticed that the FA Cup has lost so much of its magic, that even the act of pointing out it has lost its magic has lost its magic. Indeed, you could now go so far as to say that we have reached the point of peak FA Cup magic-loss, in so far as pointing out that the competition has lost its magic has not only lost its magic, but even pointing out that pointing out it has lost its magic has lost its magic.\nBut while FA Cup final day is a pale facsimile of the great day it once was, it is still a showpiece event well worth winning. And when Liverpool play Chelsea tomorrow at \u2013 the Fiver clutches its pearls \u2013 4.45pm, not all but plenty of the eyes of nation will be focused on Wembley.

For me it was the best moment of my life. That moment always will be in my heart. We don\u2019t know what would have happened if we\u2019d lost the Premier League that year.

                    "body": "As Kepa Arrizabalaga\u2019s losing penalty kick soared high into the dark Wembley skies, still rising, some said, as it cleared Wembley Park tube station, the mass of Liverpool fans behind the goal produced a vast barrelling cheer, bodies tumbling, flares turning the night red. For the Chelsea end, relieved from glorious distraction of an apparently never-ending penalty shootout, the immediate future seems less clear.  Perhaps some will call for change. Sack the charitable foundation! It wasn\u2019t like this under Roman. Say what you like, he made the startlingly generous flow of private cash into a winning playing squad work. Either way, a losing Carabao Cup final felt like a suitably low-key day one for the post-Roman era; the alternate, rebooted Roman era, or wherever it is Chelsea FC finds itself heading off into right now. It was a strange day all round. As Chelsea\u2019s players missed chance after chance in the opening hour, as Mason Mount bludgeoned the ball into the advertising boards with all the finesse of man kicking an empty can of baked beans along the hard shoulder of the motorway, Thomas Tuchel could be seen beating the touchline turf with his fists, beseeching the Wembley skies, a tableau of agonised confusion. Yes, get it out Thomas. Because these are certainly fraught and interesting times. On the pitch this was an absorbing, ruminative cup final. Off it, this was football with a side order of European land war, the second-tier domestic cup competition spiced with a sense of impending mutual assured destruction. And right now everything about Chelsea FC seems fraught with macro-chaos. Not least the exact status of the club\u2019s ownership. The idea that Roman Abramovich has handed over \u201cstewardship and care\u201d of the club, as per Saturday night\u2019s weirdly casual official statement, is baffling enough. Really? Define \u201cstewardship\u201d. What about \u201ccare\u201d? Can the trustees of the club\u2019s charitable foundation decide to sell it? Can they buy a better centre forward or sack the manager? Or refuse to compete in the Champions League until Russian clubs are expelled? If not, why not? The Labour MP Chris Bryant has already suggested the stewardship stuff could be an attempt by Abramovich to avoid being caught up in the process of sanctions. Abramovich vehemently disputes any suggestion of his alleged closeness to Vladimir Putin and Russia or that he has done anything to merit being sanctioned.  \u201cI\u2019m worried that this is a classic Russian ruse,\u201d Bryant told the Guardian on Saturday, although his suggestion that Abramovich \u201ccould save himself a lot of bother by condemning Putin and his criminal invasion of Ukraine\u201d is at least a chance for a little laughter in the dark. Let\u2019s be clear, Abramovich could create a vast amount of bother for himself by saying that, whatever his past loyalties. And for now nothing has really changed. The club will receive its usual top-ups. The \u00a31.5bn loans have not been called in. The show goes on, sealed within that pool of distracting light. And Wembley was a chilly, crisp, crackly place at kick-off, the thin afternoon sun creeping down the roof of the far stand. Football tends to do this. The world keeps on ending. Still people keep showing up asking where the party is. There was an early moment of apparently genuine absurdity as the in-house PA asked the crowd to stand so that Ukraine would know \u201cthe whole football family\u201d supports them, even as death rains down on their houses and the bodies pile up in Kyiv. This is of course nauseating double\u2011speak. In reality the football family, led by its governing bodies, has spent the past 12 years legitimising Vladimir Putin\u2019s regime, and bolstering his influence. The wretched, fawning Gianni Infantino has dishonoured his sport, and humiliated himself by padding after Putin like a needy puppy. Russian clubs are still in Uefa competitions. Russia are still en route to the World Cup. A club owned and funded by a Russian oligarch: well they\u2019re out there right now dressed in blue. Meanwhile, the game juddered on towards that apparently inevitable penalty shootout. \u00c9douard Mendy made an incredible double save midway through the first half. Both teams had goals disallowed And so the mind began to wonder. There was once a dream that was Roman. It is 19 years now since Russia\u2019s most famous billionaire paid \u00a3140m to take control of Chelsea. It was a style\u2011setting administration from the start. Two decades on, as he cruises from around the Med, still low key super-flash but essentially mute, oddly untouchable, it is easy to forget the glossy, celebrified aspect of Abramovich\u2019s arrival in west London.  Nobody really stopped to ask why he was here, or why he wanted to own Chelsea. Why would you? In the summer of 2003 the common response to the appearance of the English football\u2019s first overseas billionaire was a collective gawp, a phwoar, a wa-hey, a vicarious drool at the flash, the show, the trappings of the post\u2011communist uber-lad lifestyle. Abramovich owned a yacht with two helipads and its own submarine. He bought a house that looked like an embassy. He was a fun-loving billionaire. Of course this was normal. And everything was new in this picture. Vladimir Putin had come to power in Russia just three years previously. The fall of the Berlin wall was only nine years before that. Oligarchs: what were they exactly? How did this work, this evolving system of commerce and power? The assumption was that buying Chelsea offered a kind of \u201cinsurance policy\u201d, a way of making himself known in another country, protected by his visibility. Does that seem right now? Does anything seem right? At Wembley there were Ukraine flags in both ends, and plenty in the blue end. The Chelsea Supporters\u2019 Trust has made its feelings clear: \u201cWe stand with the people of Ukraine\u201d. And, this is the strange lot of the football supporter now. Blaming a club\u2019s fans for the sins of its owners makes little sense. But it is quite possible to have a voice while still loving the team, the shirt, the players. That connection, that source of joy: none of it attaches to whoever the current owner happens to be. Within 10 minutes of that final penalty kick the Chelsea end was almost empty. Liverpool\u2019s fans stayed to dance and shout and applaud the medals being handed out. This is a vital little notch on the belt for J\u00fcrgen Klopp, a first domestic cup in a decade, and another step in the building of an era. For two hours at Wembley football had shut the doors on the world outside and staged its own show. For Chelsea, day one of the new world felt quite a lot like the old one. But it seems likely change is coming in one form or another."

After a goalless draw in the first leg, Inter went ahead after just four minutes here when Mart\u00ednez smartly turned in Matteo Darmian\u2019s cross at the near post. Milan rallied and Inter keeper Samir Handanovic was forced into fine saves to deny Rafael Le\u00e3o and Alexis Saelemaekers. The Rossoneri were left to rue those missed chances as Inter doubled their lead five minutes before the interval. It was Argentina forward Mart\u00ednez on target again, slotting the ball home after being played in by his compatriot Joaqu\u00edn Correa. Isma\u00ebl Bennacer\u2019s 68th-minute strike for Milan was ruled out for offside, before substitute Robin Gosens sealed the win for Simone Inzaghi\u2019s side.  \u201cI am happy because we are playing another final,\u201d said Mart\u00ednez, who has endured a difficult season but was picked by Inzaghi ahead of Edin Dzeko for Tuesday\u2019s match. \u201cThere are things said that I don\u2019t like, but I defend this jersey. The club put a lot of faith in me and I try to repay them on the pitch.\u201d The result is a psychological blow for Milan, currently two points clear of a resurgent Inter in the title race. \u201cI don\u2019t think the performance was worthy of a 3-0 but Inter scored at the right times,\u201d said the Milan head coach, Stefano Pioli. \u201cWe didn\u2019t lack for effort, intensity or chances but it wasn\u2019t our night.\u201d Inter are one step closer to their first Coppa Italia triumph since 2011, and will face either Juventus or Fiorentina in the final. Juve are 1-0 up after the first leg of their semi-final, with the second leg taking place in Turin on Wednesday. Freiburg earn historic German Cup final spot Freiburg struck three times in the first half to win 3-1 at second-tier Hamburg and reach the DFB-Pokal final for the first time in their history. The Hamburg forward Robert Glatzel headed wide when well-placed in the early stages, before Nils Petersen scored on the rebound for the visitors in the 11th minute. Midfielder Nicolas Hoefler doubled the advantage six minutes later, his shot from the edge of the area flying into the roof of the net.  Vincenzo Grifo made it 3-0 after just 35 minutes, sending keeper Daniel Heuer Fernandes the wrong way from the penalty spot after a foul on Nico Schlotterbeck. Hamburg saw Anssi Suhonen\u2019s goal disallowed for offside soon after, and could not get on the scoresheet until the 88th minute when Glatzel nodded home.Freiburg, who are fifth in the Bundesliga and just one point outside the Champions League places, will face either RB Leipzig or Union Berlin in the final on 21 May. Hamburg\u2019s exit also means that a new name is guaranteed to be engraved on the German Cup this season. In Spain, Real Betis and Valencia will contest the Copa del Rey final on Saturday, but both sides missed the chance to build momentum with losses in La Liga on Tuesday.  Manuel Pellegrini\u2019s Betis side suffered a major blow to their top-four hopes as they lost 1-0 at home to Elche. Victory would have put Betis level on points with Barcelona, Sevilla and Atl\u00e9tico Madrid in the top four, but they could not find the breakthrough before Tete Morente\u2019s 82nd-minute winner for the visitors. Valencia lost 2-0 at Villarreal, with Arnaut Danjuma scoring twice in the first half as Unai Emery\u2019s side tuned up for their Champions League semi-final with Liverpool. Villarreal stay in seventh place and will not play again until the first leg at Anfield next Wednesday. Elsewhere, Mallorca climbed out of the relegation zone with a 2-1 home win over the bottom club, Alav\u00e9s."

Mead, named on Thursday as England\u2019s player of the year, said before Friday\u2019s meeting of the European champions and world champions at a sold-out Wembley: \u201cI was quite sickened when I found out. It\u2019s a worldwide problem. Women need to be taken seriously a lot more. I\u2019m proud of the victims that stood up. People need to start doing better.  \u201cWe\u2019re in contact with the USA team and some of the players. We are working on something on our support of them.\u201d England\u2019s manager, Sarina Wiegman, said her first reaction to the report was that it was \u201chorrible and unacceptable\u201d. She said: \u201cI feel very sorry for all the victims and it should stop immediately, of course. I think it\u2019s a worldwide problem still. It\u2019s time we will step up and stop these things.\u201d Mead believes England players feel more empowered to speak about off-field issues than they did in the past. \u201cWe feel we have a good platform to make a difference,\u201d the forward said, citing the squad writing to Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak when they were Conservative party leadership candidates, calling for equal access to football in school for girls. \u201cWe wrote the letter about PE in schools. We want to use our platform for the greater good of the women\u2019s game and women\u2019s sport in general.\u201d Friday\u2019s friendly will be the teams\u2019 first meeting since the SheBelieves Cup in March 2020, when the US won 2-0, eight months after they knocked England out of the World Cup semi-finals in France. \u201cWe took it [the defeat] hard but it\u2019s made us more hungry and motivated to prove ourselves against a world-class American team,\u201d said Mead. \u201cWe\u2019re looking forward to seeing where we are.\u201d Wiegman, who is without the captain, Leah Williamson, the striker Alessia Russo and the defender Lucy Parker because of injuries, said: \u201cWe want to win the game but we also want to see how we can do. Then we have 10 months to the World Cup. \u201cThe European game is getting closer and closer [to the US]. We\u2019re not only thinking in results. Yes, we want to win, but we hope we can dominate the game. You have to perform at the highest level and these games give you the best information. We can play lower teams and score lots but it doesn\u2019t give you the picture you need to prepare for next year.\u201d"

                    "body": "Kevin De Bruyne believes Manchester City have to win the Champions League to change the perception of the club despite their recent domestic dominance.\nPep Guardiola\u2019s team will reach a second successive final if Real Madrid are knocked out at the Bernab\u00e9u on Wednesday. City hold a 4-3 advantage from the first leg. In the past decade City have claimed five Premier League titles, the FA Cup and six League Cups with the European Cup the main prize to have eluded them. The 1970 Cup Winners\u2019 Cup remains their only European silverware.\n\n\u201cI think it would change the perspective from outside,\u201d he said of Champions League victory. \u201cAs a player you want to win trophies and we want to win this one. The fact we\u2019ve been fighting for numerous years and getting to the latter stages means we\u2019ve been doing really well. It\u2019s a cup competition and the quality is very high so it\u2019s very difficult to win it but in the end if you look back at the way we performed and I have performed over seven years we have done really well. We have not won it but winning it would change that little narrative.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it changes the perspective of how I look at myself as a player. I\u2019ve known what I\u2019ve done good and bad in my career and I\u2019m pretty happy with what I\u2019ve done. I want to win every trophy that I can get but that\u2019s a hard task. I would obviously love to win the Champions League.\u201d\nDe Bruyne is likely to be the only City player to start on Wednesday who was also in the XI that lost 1-0 at Madrid in the second leg of the 2016 semi-final, when Fernando scored a decisive own goal.\n\u201cI think we are in better shape now,\u201d he said. \u201cI remember when we played that game and didn\u2019t have the greatest end of the season. Madrid was the powerhouse at the time. I know we lost 1-0 in the end with an own goal but it was a pretty boring game if I remember correctly. We\u2019re in better shape right now, we are better set up as a team and play better and have more experience in this stage so we will hopefully be better prepared.\u201d\n\nWednesday\u2019s game is Guardiola\u2019s ninth Champions League semi-final as a manager. De Bruyne was asked whether this experience could help the team. \u201cNo matter the game we are well prepared anyway,\u201d the midfielder said. \u201cWhether it is the League Cup against a lower-league team there are the same amount of details for us. It is easier to watch a Madrid game on the TV than someone from the lower leagues but every game we play we want to win.\u201d\nDe Bruyne has scored seven goals in his past 10 games, a return to his finest form after the ankle injury that blighted his start to the season.\n\u201cThe first months of the season were really hard,\u201d he said. \u201cI have never experienced the pain that I had back then. I was trying to come back but was in pain with my ankle every day and it wasn\u2019t something I enjoyed.\u201d\n\nDe Bruyne struggled to play through it. \u201cMentally it was hard to overcome that but once the pain was gone after a couple of months I started to feel more confident in myself and my body to get back to where I belong,\u201d he said. \u201cNow playing all these games week in, week out I feel back to the level that I was before.\u201d\nGuardiola expects the match to be as open as last Tuesday\u2019s first leg. \u201cProbably but we can play much, much worse than we played and win,\u201d said the manager. \u201cNobody knows, football is unpredictable. Sometimes you don\u2019t get what you deserve, sometimes you get something you don\u2019t deserve.\u201d\nKyle Walker has missed the past five matches with an ankle problem but has returned to training. \u201cHe is going to travel and tomorrow we will decide,\u201d Guardiola said. \u201cHe was three weeks without training. We will decide tomorrow but we are happy he is back and he will try to be in contention.\u201d If Walker starts, City will have their first-choice back four, the right-back joining R\u00faben Dias, Aymeric Laporte and Jo\u00e3o Cancelo, who was suspended for the opening leg.\n\nCarlo Ancelotti can field Casemiro again after the holding midfielder\u2019s muscular problem, though the head coach of the newly crowned La Liga champions denied this would cause Real to alter how they defend.\n\u201cIf we bring back our defensive line we\u2019ll be conceding more chances,\u201d he said. \u201cIn the first leg I had a feeling we needed to take our chances, which we did, and we need to do so again. We are good enough to take them.\u201d"

I didn\u2019t think Chelsea were particularly great today. We just made it complicated for ourselves.\u201d\nThere has been very little to separate the two London teams this season. Chelsea, as FA Cup holders and the league leaders, had the edge over their title rivals going into this match. The Blues dominated from the off in a 3-0 defeat of the Gunners in the 2021 final in December. But despite Arsenal\u2019s league position one point behind Chelsea, Jonas Eidevall\u2019s team have taken four points from their two league meetings \u2013 most recently the spoils were shared in a 0-0 draw at Kingsmeadow in February.\n\nIn north London it was like time had stood still for more than two months as the game kicked off with the same intensity, and it was Arsenal that began the brighter side with Beth Mead and Stina Blackstenius finding space on the right early on. For the visitors, there was a disconnect with the forward Sam Kerr, who struggled up against the new England captain, Leah Williamson.\n\n\u201cThey exploited and got in behind in the first half probably too many times, more than we\u2019d like, but as the game went on we just got stronger and got ourselves organised a bit quicker and a bit better,\u201d Chelsea\u2019s Jess Carter said.\nAt Wembley in December Eidevall was without the influential centre\u2011back Williamson but here it was Chelsea who were weakened by the absence of important players. Their captain and centre-back, Magda Eriksson, was deemed only fit enough for the bench. Meanwhile the England international Fran Kirby, whose third\u2011minute goal and potent partnership with Kerr lit up the final, was ruled out for the foreseeable future by Hayes before the game on Sunday as the hunt for answers to her fatigue problem continues.\nDespite the fluidity to their play Arsenal struggled to make it count. A fierce strike from the edge of the box from Miedema that sailed narrowly over the bar highlighted their profligacy and they finished a dominant half on the back foot.\nFirst Miedema gifted the ball to the Chelsea forward Erin Cuthbert before recovering it with a stunning sliding tackle. Then Williamson was at fault, delivering the ball straight to Beth England before dispossessing her international teammate shortly after as Chelsea upped the ante.\nAt half-time the home side were without a shot on target and their lack of cutting edge would prove to be their undoing.\nWithin minutes of Mead swivelling in the box and firing agonisingly wide, Reiten floated towards the edge of the D and lifted a curling shot across the goal and into the far corner.\n\u201cWe should have scored two or three in the first half,\u201d Miedema said. \u201cThen you\u2019ve obviously got a completely different game. We get a big chance in the second half and we also don\u2019t score and then they do. So I just feel like we\u2019ve given it away.\u201d\nSign up for our new and free women\u2019s football newsletter\n\nChelsea had a second just after the hour and, despite a defensive mess, Arsenal had cause to feel aggrieved after the full-back Steph Catley recovered possession for the home team but was penalised for handball despite it deflecting off her face.\nMillie Bright lofted the resulting free-kick from deep within the Chelsea half to Kerr and the Arsenal defender Lotte Wubben-Moy\u2019s clearance fell to Ji, who stepped past Lia W\u00e4lti and fired in.\n\n\u201cOnce we got the second the game felt easier,\u201d Hayes said. \u201cWe were more confident and comfortable. You have to earn that. Our superiority in the second half was due to the character in the team. It\u2019s not easy to keep winning, it really isn\u2019t. I\u2019m never preoccupied with those things. It\u2019s two very, very good teams.\u201d\nChelsea\u2019s win sets up a final against Manchester City, who beat the Blues 3-1 in the Continental League Cup final last month. \u201cThe Continental Cup final has been and gone,\u201d Carter said. \u201cNow it\u2019s just about focusing on [this final] and we\u2019ll do the best that we can to come away with the trophy.\u201d"

                    "body": "Progress in economic thought comes in three stages; first they laugh at you, then they fight you, then they ask you to write a quirky book explaining your ideas to a mass audience. Ha-Joon Chang has been working hard at providing an alternative to neoliberalism for two decades now, ever since his book Kicking Away the Ladder pointed out that low taxes, free trade and deregulation simply wasn\u2019t the way that most rich countries had developed. Now he\u2019s reached the summit of the profession; a fun little book of essays (some of them extended and expanded versions of columns for FT Magazine), restating the case against the Washington consensus through the medium of recipes. The recipes are not likely to give Yotam Ottolenghi much cause for concern \u2013 an example is the one for monkfish in curried clam broth, which just says \u201cmonkfish, served in a curried clam broth\u201d. Instead, they act as jumping-off points for the economics. Curried clam broth leads into consideration of the spice trade, and then to the Dutch East India Company, and then to limited liability companies in general, and to suggestions about how the reform of corporate governance might make it possible to sustain long-term investments in green technology. This gives the book the whiff of a collection of sermons. There\u2019s nothing intrinsically wrong with that; a good short sermon with a few interesting thoughts and a sharp moral point is a greatly underestimated form of entertainment for a Sunday morning. But some of them work much better than others: the train of thought from spices to shareholder value runs along quite smoothly, but elsewhere the narrative shifts from chicken to the welfare system with all the elegance of a Eurovision key-change.  Chang does say upfront that this is what he\u2019s going to do \u2013 that this isn\u2019t a book about the economics of food per se, but a restatement of his core arguments, with culinary anecdotes functioning as treats to keep the reader interested. And they are, by and large, excellent anecdotes. Chang was born in Seoul in the 1960s and came to the UK to go to university in the 80s. So his life and career have encompassed not only the explosion of British food culture (he confirms, to an audience that might have forgotten, just how ghastly and bland things used to be), but also the development of South Korea, from a poor semi-industrialised state to the global economic and cultural powerhouse it is today. That development obviously shaped Chang\u2019s outlook \u2013 in chapters with titles such as Noodle and Banana, he sketches out the story of his home country\u2019s rise, with an emphasis on its protection of infant industries and close regulation of multinational corporations. Interestingly, it also appears to have shaped the Korean relationship with food. Because one thing that comes through in Edible Economics, which is more absent in his Chang\u2019s previous books, is that development is difficult. There\u2019s a tendency among leftwing economists to reproduce the boosterism of the neoliberals in the opposite direction; to suggest that a different policy mix with more regulation and redistribution could act as just as much of a silver bullet. As Chang points out, the fact of the matter is that places such as Korea developed because of sustained investment. And \u201cinvestment\u201d here means \u201cnon-consumption\u201d: long decades of doing without. He explains that chocolate was a rare, black-market commodity in his youth. Protecting infant industries means not having access to every good under the sun, and accepting that you\u2019re going to have to spend years driving terrible locally made cars so that Hyundai and Kia have time to climb the technology curve. In a book containing such a variety of food recipes, it\u2019s a bit ironic that this is suggested as more or less the only recipe for economic development \u2013 domestic demand austerity, industrial planning and protection, state-directed lending and, above all, a focus on high-value manufacturing. Chang dismisses alternative economic models \u2013 those based on commodity exports, or on services \u2013 rather quickly.Chang\u2019s preferred growth model, once unorthodox, is close to being an \u201canti-Washington\u201d consensus these days, and like all such consensuses, has weaknesses. Most seriously, there\u2019s little engagement with the idea that economic growth itself might be the problem, and that curbing climate change isn\u2019t just a matter of finding the right investment incentives. But this is a good book. As with a Church of England sermon, it\u2019s easy to chuckle at the artless way in which the points are sometimes brought in, \u2013 \u201cIn a very real sense, isn\u2019t the carrot rather like a patent system?\u201d but that might also be precisely what makes them stick in the mind. \u2022 Edible Economics: A Hungry Economist Explains the World by Ha-Joon Chang is published by Penguin (\u00a320).

David Hytner\u2019s report is in, though. Here it is. Thanks for reading this MBM. Enjoy the rest of the Easter break!\n\n\n\n\n 5.45pm  \n\nJurgen Klopp talks to the Beeb. \u201cI am absolutely proud. The first half was one of the best we have ever played. We did all the right stuff, scored in the right moments, an incredible game in the first half, I really loved each second of it. The second half started with a goal for Man City and then it opens up, they quality of City is insane. We respect the quality of City so much, it is so difficult to win against them, but because it\u2019s these boys in my dressing room, we have a chance! We don\u2019t use it as a statement, we just wanted to goal to the final. The quadruple talk, I cannot believe. We beat the best football team in the world, and that\u2019s a pretty special moment.\u201d\n\n\n\n 5.39pm  \n\nVirgil van Dijk speaks to the BBC, amid less bedlam this time. \u201cWe made it very difficult for ourselves in the end. But overall we are very happy to get to the final. It was a perfect first half, but they are the champions of England at the moment, and there will be moments when you have to suffer. It\u2019s tough! It was warm, and intense, but we should have killed the game off in my opinion.\u201d And the final? \u201cIt\u2019s the only trophy we haven\u2019t won [as a group] so we will give it a go, but whether it is Chelsea or Crystal Palace it will be tough regardless. We have to be ready for it.\u201d\n\n\n\n 5.32pm  \n\nSadio Mane speaks to the BBC, though he can barely be heard above the din being made by the celebrating Liverpool supporters. \u201cIt is special. It was not an easy game. It\u2019s a big, big, big win. We are very pleased to qualify for the final. We started very well, we pressed them high, the goalkeeper made a mistake. I was very happy to score two goals, but the performance of the team was fantastic.\u201d As for the quadruple? \u201cWe will try our best. We will fight for it.\u201d\n\n\n\n 5.29pm  \n\nLiverpool will be back at Wembley next month after another ding-dong battle with Manchester City. Pep Guardiola must have delivered one hell of a half-time team-talk, because having been blown away in the first half, his players very nearly completed an outrageous comeback in the second. Liverpool were much the better team over the piece, though, with City strangely undercooked. Or maybe it\u2019s not so strange, given their efforts in Madrid earlier in the week. Take nothing away from Liverpool, though; they were effervescent in attack from start to finish, with Mane and Luis Diaz particularly impressive. Jurgen Klopp runs up to the Liverpool supporters and does his fist-pumping, badge-patting, heart-beating thing. Chelsea or Crystal Palace will stand in the way of Liverpool\u2019s eighth FA Cup.\n\n\nUpdated at 5.38pm BST\n\n\n 5.24pm  \nFULL TIME: Manchester City 2-3 Liverpool\n\nLiverpool stumble over the line! They\u2019re in their first FA Cup final since 2012!\n\n\n\n 5.23pm  \n\n90 min +5: This is absurd! Steffen comes out of his box to clear a loose ball. Firmino takes control. He tries to round the keeper, but with no success. Steffen claims.\n\n\n\n 5.23pm  \n\n90 min +4: The ball\u2019s blootered up the other end. Salah scampers into acres down the right. You\u2019d think he\u2019d take the ball towards the corner flag, but he opts to shoot instead! Goal kick.\n\n\n\n 5.22pm  \n\n90 min +3: That corner leads to some pinball. Now it\u2019s Mahrez\u2019s turn to have a shot. That\u2019s deflected out, too! From the second corner, Sterling gets the ball at his feet, just inside the box. He shapes a shot towards the bottom right. Alisson gets down to claim. Liverpool are really clinging on here!\n\n\n\n 5.21pm  \n\n90 min +2: Bedlam in the Liverpool box. The ball breaks to Fernandinho on the penalty spot. He volleys goalwards. Van Dijk deflects over the bar! Corner!\n\n\n\n 5.20pm  \nGOAL! Manchester City 2-3 Liverpool (Silva 90+1)\n\nYes they can! Mahrez skins Robertson down the right, reaches the byline, and shoots from a tight angle. Alisson makes a block, but the ball squirts across the face of goal to Silva, who slots from close range at the far post!\n\n\nUpdated at 5.22pm BST\n\n\n 5.19pm  \n\n90 min: BBC co-commentator Martin Keown names Sadio Mane as the man of the match. There will be four added minutes. Can City set up a dramatic climax?\n\n\n\n 5.17pm  \n\n89 min: Salah dribbles with pace down the right. He can\u2019t get a shot away, Ake showing some great determination, and not for the first time this afternoon.\n\n\n\n 5.16pm  \n\n88 min: Henderson shovels a pass forward. Jota scampers after it, but Steffen wins the race.\n\n\n\n 5.15pm  \n\n87 min: Liverpool replace Thiago with Jones.\n\n\n\n 5.15pm  \n\n86 min: A news story on the disgraceful chanting during the period of silence.\n\n\n\n\n 5.14pm  \n\n85 min: Jota and Firmino come on for Diaz and Mane. Salah then dribbles into the City box from the right and scuffs a shot straight at Steffen.\n\n\n\n 5.13pm  \n\n84 min: Sterling wastes the free kick, hoicking it miles over the bar and wide left to boot. \n\n\nUpdated at 5.19pm BST\n\n\n 5.12pm  \n\n83 min: Jesus bursts down the inside-left channel and is brought down clumsily by Thiago. A free kick just to the left of the D, 25 yards out. Before it can be taken, Mahrez comes on for Jesus.\n\n\n\n 5.11pm  \n\n82 min: Van Dijk plays a long pass from the left-back position towards Salah on the right-hand edge of the City box. Steffen comes to the edge of his box to gather.\n\n\n\n 5.09pm  \n\n80 min: ... so having said that, Liverpool enjoy some possession of their own. They edge up the pitch. Diaz bobbles a shot straight at Steffen, who gathers without fuss.\n\n\n\n 5.06pm  \n\n78 min: Ake tries to release Cancelo down the right, but the pass is too strong. Nothing\u2019s quite coming off for City right now, though they are beginning to dominate possession again.\n\n\n\n 5.05pm  \n\n76 min: Both teams take turns to play a little keep ball. Passages of play that benefit Liverpool more than City, given the scoreline and the numbers on the clock.\n\n\n\n 5.02pm  \n\n74 min: Henderson comes on for Keita.\n\n\n\n 5.02pm  \n\n72 min: Robertson pearls a long pass down the middle for Diaz, who brings the ball down on the edge of the box but can\u2019t get a shot away. Instead he flicks wide right, hoping to find Salah. Zinchenko heads back towards his keeper, but doesn\u2019t get enough on it. Salah nips in, and should score, but his dink over Steffen wafts into the side netting. A huge chance to put this game to bed. City remain hopeful.\n\n\n\n 4.59pm  \n\n71 min: Fabinho\u2019s pass out from the back is cut out by Silva, then Grealish slips Jesus away down the inside left. He\u2019s clear on goal! He shapes for the bottom right. Alisson stays big and makes the block with a strong hand. Nothing comes of the resulting corner. That\u2019s a huge save.\n\n\nUpdated at 5.05pm BST\n\n\n 4.57pm  \n\n69 min: Keita releases the pressure with an overly ambitious whack at goal.\n\n\n\n 4.57pm  \n\n68 min: City struggle to get out of their final third as Liverpool turn up the press.\n\n\n\n 4.55pm  \n\n66 min: Salah nearly scuttles clear down the inside-right channel, but Ake holds firm, making sure he can\u2019t get a shot away at the cost of a corner. The resulting set piece is a complete non-event.\n\n\n\n 4.54pm  \n\n65 min: Thaigo and Robertson confuse each other, allowing Jesus to tear off down the right. Jesus fires (I\u2019m not going anywhere near the word \u2018cross\u2019, I just can\u2019t) the ball into the mixer. Konate chests down and clears.\n\nUpdated at 4.54pm BST\n\n\n 4.51pm  \n\n63 min: City are dominating possession. Liverpool are holding their shape, there\u2019s no way through at the minute.\n\n\n\n 4.49pm  \n\n61 min: Mane is booked for a crafty clip on Fernandinho\u2019s heel.\n\n\n\n 4.49pm  \n\n60 min: Kevin De Bruyne - an injury concern before the game, having gashed his foot against Atletico Madrid - is warming up. We\u2019ll see him soon as City prepare to roll the dice.\n\n\n\n 4.47pm  \n\n58 min: Here\u2019s the full text of that apology issued by a Manchester City spokesperson. \u201cManchester City are extremely disappointed with the actions of some City supporters during the minute\u2019s silence before today\u2019s game. The club sincerely apologises to all those connected with Liverpool Football Club.\u201d\n\n\n\n 4.45pm  \n\n56 min: Fernandinho comes sliding in at warp speed, flipping Mane into the air like an old sock. It\u2019s a yellow card all day long. He was lucky not to be booked in the first half, so there\u2019s a fair chance he might get hooked soon.\n\n\nUpdated at 4.54pm BST\n\n\n 4.43pm  \n\n55 min: Jesus springs that trap again, but this time Van Dijk ushers him wide and Alisson blocks out for a corner. Nothing comes of that set piece, either. The next goal so important here. Liverpool suddenly don\u2019t look quite so imperious.\n\n\n\n 4.42pm  \n\n53 min: A free kick for Liverpool out on the right. Alexander-Arnold loops it in. Van Dijk prepares to sidefoot home from six yards, only for Ake to toe out for a corner. A crucial intervention. Nothing comes of the corner. \u201cI\u2019m going to be honest with you, I didn\u2019t think Jesus was springing the offside trap until tomorrow.\u201d Austin from Chicago there, because somebody had to. He\u2019s here all week. Try the consecrated bread.\n\n\n\n 4.39pm  \n\n51 min: Diaz makes a nuisance of himself on the edge of the City box, teeing up Mane, who swivels and aims for the bottom right, but gets no real purchase on the shot.\n\n\n\n 4.37pm  \n\n49 min: Shades of Crystal Palace\u2019s fast start to the second half against Liverpool in the 1990 semi? Liverpool fans of a certain vintage will remember that with a shudder. Meanwhile here\u2019s Paul Griffin: \u201cHow can anyone watching a sunny FA Cup semi-final decide that they won\u2019t spend sixty seconds reflecting on the deaths of three sisters, three pairs of brothers, a father and his son, a ten year old boy, two expectant fathers, and dozens of teenagers, adults, men and women who went to watch another sunny FA Cup semi final football and didn\u2019t come home? Emetic.\u201d\n\n\n\n 4.36pm  \n\n48 min: Keita is booked for a high kick on Fernandinho. Liverpool\u2019s turn to be rattled?\n\n\n\n 4.36pm  \nGOAL! Manchester City 1-3 Liverpool (Grealish 47)\n\nIt\u2019s taken 70 seconds for City to get back into this! Jesus springs the offside trap down the right, holding off Fabinho and rolling across for Grealish, who pearls a shot into the top left from 12 yards. It\u2019s back on!\n\n\nUpdated at 4.43pm BST\n\n\n 4.34pm  \n\nCity get the second half started. No changes. Meanwhile the club have reportedly issued an apology to Liverpool for the actions of some of their fans during the minute\u2019s silence for the victims of Hillsborough.\n\n\n\n 4.28pm  \n\nA depressing line here from the Press Association. \u201cThe match was to be preceded by a minute\u2019s silence for the 33rd anniversary of the Hillsborough disaster but this was cut short by referee Michael Oliver after chants from the City end.\u201d\n\n\n\n 4.21pm  \n\nHalf-time entertainment. Crystal Palace take on Chelsea in the other semi-final tomorrow afternoon. Ed Aarons profiles one of the men behind Palace\u2019s renaissance.\n\n\n\n\n 4.18pm  \nHALF TIME: Manchester City 0-3 Liverpool\n\nYou\u2019d have got good odds on this. Liverpool have been magnificent. City are on the ropes all right.\n\n\nUpdated at 4.21pm BST\n\n\n 4.16pm  \nGOAL! Manchester City 0-3 Liverpool (Mane 45)\n\nThat speech is going to be even more crucial now. Thiago dinks a one-two with Alexander-Arnold on the edge of the City D, before stroking a pass towards Mane, bombing in from the right. Mane, brimful of confidence, lashes a first-time shot into the bottom right, giving Steffen no chance!\n\n\nUpdated at 4.24pm BST\n\n\n 4.15pm  \n\n44 min: Pep is in deep discussion with his staff, planning that half-time speech.\n\n\n\n 4.14pm  \n\n43 min: Cancelo bodychecks Diaz as the tricky Liverpool winger fizzes down the left. The free kick is whipped into the mixer. Stones wins a crucial header with red shirts lurking.\n\n\n\n 4.13pm  \n\n41 min: Alexander-Arnold, Thiago, Salah and Keita probe down the right. Ake stands firm to make sure there\u2019s no way through ... just. Liverpool certainly aren\u2019t sitting on their lead.\n\n\n\n 4.10pm  \n\n39 min: Fair play to Steffen. Alexander-Arnold rakes a pass down the middle for Salah, who would be clear on goal had the keeper not read the danger, coming well out of his area to control and clear under pressure. That\u2019s some brave work given what happened earlier.\n\n\n\n 4.08pm  \n\n37 min: Fabinho is booked for a cynical clip on Jesus, who was making good down the right. This is getting scrappy.\n\n\n\n 4.07pm  \n\n36 min: Salah rolls a pass down the left for Robertson, who initially looks like romping clear into the box. But Cancelo comes across and executes a perfectly timed sliding tackle, even winning the throw. Top-drawer defending.\n\n\n\n 4.06pm  \n\n35 min: Silva kicks the back of Mane\u2019s leg. Again he gets away with one. On the touchline, Klopp enters into a discussion with the fourth official. You can probably guess the content.\n\n\n\n 4.04pm  \n\n33 min: The referee is in a laissez-faire mood all right. Now he shows lenience with Mane, who had wafted a hand into Cancelo\u2019s face while challenging for Alexander-Arnold\u2019s long ball.\n\n\n\n 4.03pm  \n\n32 min: Silva comes clattering into Fabinho and becomes the second City player fairly lucky to avoid a booking.\n\n\n\n 4.02pm  \n\n31 min: City are beginning to dominate possession, but aren\u2019t doing a whole lot with it. \n\n\n\n 4.01pm  \n\n29 min: Another shaky Alisson clearance, Grealish nearly closing him down, the ball pinging off the City man and inviting a period of pressure. Nothing comes of the phase, but the nerves are showing at both ends.\n\n\n\n 3.58pm  \n\n27 min: Diaz spins into space in the middle of the park and is cynically tripped by Jesus, who goes into the book.\n\n\nUpdated at 4.07pm BST\n\n\n 3.57pm  \n\n26 min: Sterling has a run at the Liverpool defence. Diaz and Robertson combine to close down the route. Thiago sashays up the other end and finds Salah on the right. Salah tries to find Mane at the far stick but his cross is intercepted easily by Stones.\n\n\n\n 3.54pm  \n\n24 min: Fernandinho hangs out a leg as Diaz makes his way down the left. It\u2019s a free kick, but he\u2019s very lucky not to go into the book. Robertson\u2019s ball in is easily dealt with by City.\n\n\n\n 3.53pm  \n\n22 min: That\u2019ll have caused Alisson some consternation, the goalkeeper\u2019s union and all that. He makes a couple of slightly shaky clearances himself. There but for the grace of God, etc.\n\n\n\n 3.52pm  \n\n20 min: City pass the ball back to Steffen. Ironic cheers. It\u2019s going to be a long 70 minutes for poor Steffen.\n\n\n\n 3.50pm  \n\n19 min: Did City learn nothing from Ederson\u2019s scrape with Diogo Jota in the Premier League match last week?! Oh my.\n\n\nUpdated at 4.01pm BST\n\n\n 3.49pm  \nGOAL! Manchester City 0-2 Liverpool (Mane 17)\n\nThis is a complete farce! City stroke it around the back. The ball ends up at the feet of Steffen, on the edge of his six-yard box. Steffen takes a heavy touch. Enough to let Mane slide in and force the ball into the net! An absolute howler by the City keeper!\n\n\nUpdated at 3.54pm BST\n\n\n 3.47pm  \n\n15 min: Fernandinho takes a free kick in the centre circle, looking for Cancelo down the right. He springs him clear, but the offside flag goes up. City come again, though. A high cross comes in from the right. Foden does well to win a header, stretching every sinew, but he can only send the ball looping into Alisson\u2019s arms.\n\n\n\n 3.44pm  \n\n13 min: Thiago finds Salah down the right. Salah is uncharacteristically ponderous and fails to get a cross in. Liverpool are on top right now.\n\n\n\n 3.42pm  \n\n11 min: Now it\u2019s City\u2019s turn to win a corner, Sterling panicking Van Dijk into a sliced clearance. Foden hits the first man with a poor delivery. Meanwhile red smoke from a flare wafts through the Liverpool box.\n\n\n\n 3.41pm  \nGOAL! Manchester City 0-1 Liverpool (Konate 9)\n\nMane skitters down the left and wins a corner. It\u2019s sent into the mixer by Robertson. Konate rises highest on the edge of the six-yard box, miles above Ake, and powers a header into the top left! Three in three for the big defender; the man\u2019s a goal machine.\n\n\nUpdated at 3.44pm BST\n\n\n 3.39pm  \n\n8 min: Sterling takes Konate on in a foot race down the left. He doesn\u2019t win it, but only because the defender gives him a light shove in the back. No free kick, but this could develop into an interesting duel.\n\n\n\n 3.38pm  \n\n7 min: Stones floats another poor ball across the edge of his own box and nearly lets Keita in. Liverpool\u2019s press is causing City one or two problems in these early exchanges.\n\n\n\n 3.37pm  \n\n6 min: Stones ships possession cheaply, allowing Mane to scoop a pass into the box for Salah, who can\u2019t quite get the ball under control. Keita tries to keep things going out on the right but Zinchenko and Foden combine to ensure there\u2019s no shot on goal.\n\n\n\n 3.34pm  \n\n4 min: The first shot in anger is taken by Grealish. Fernandinho rakes a diagonal pass towards Cancelo on the right. Cancelo cuts back for Grealish, who hesitates before taking a shot that\u2019s blocked. He should have taken that one first time.\n\n\n\n 3.32pm  \n\n2 min: A high-octane start. Alisson blooters a pass down the right wing. Steffen hoicks another out of play. Alexander-Arnold swishes a ball down the right for Salah, who is miles offside. Plenty of time yet for everyone to find their feet.\n\n\n\n 3.31pm  \n\nLiverpool get the ball rolling ... but only after the players take a knee. There\u2019s no room for racism.\n\n\n\n 3.30pm  \n\nBefore kick-off, a moment of silence to commemorate the 97 fans who died at the 1989 FA Cup semi-final between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest. JFT97.\n\n\n\n\n 3.28pm  \n\nThe teams are out! Wembley is packed to the rafters, sun shimmering across the hallowed turf, and the place is bouncing. Both sets of supporters are definitely up for the cup. Manchester City wear their sky blue, while Liverpool are all in red. The two best teams in the country are about to face off for a place in the 141st FA Cup final. We\u2019ll be off in a couple of minutes!\n\n\n\n 3.11pm  \n\nPep Guardiola talks to the BBC ... \u201cThe team we select is fantastic. We had no alternative. We have incredibly mentally and physically demanding fixtures. There is no other chance to do it. Fresh legs, fresh mentality. This is an important one. Exciting. We don\u2019t choose competitions, we try in every game to do our best.\u201d\n... as does Jurgen Klopp. \u201cIt\u2019s my seventh season in England and I have said everything in meetings once, twice, three times, four times, but I have never said \u2018Welcome to the semi-final of the FA Cup\u2019 [giggles] so I was allowed to say that today. It\u2019s big for us. It is our first chance and hopefully we can use it.\u201d\n\n\n\n 3.07pm  \n\nThere\u2019s already a carnival atmosphere at sunny Wembley. Thousands of fans are flocking to the stadium bedecked in blue or resplendent in red, in honour of their heroes. This gentleman has pinned his colours to the mast with an old-fashioned bespoke hat ...\n\n... a nod to the days when visitors to Wembley regularly marked the occasion by cobbling together a fancy outfit out of random tat. Yes, Gordon sprang to our mind too.\n\n\nUpdated at 3.40pm BST\n\n\n 2.50pm  \n\nIt\u2019s already been a good day for Manchester City. Lauren Hemp scored twice, with Ellen White and Chloe Kelly also finding the net, as City WFC reached the final of the Women\u2019s FA Cup with a 4-1 rout of West Ham United. Maryam Naz tells the tale.\n\n\n\n\n 2.43pm  \n\nBoth teams make seven changes to the sides named in the Champions League during the week. Manchester City replace Ederson in goal with cup specialist Zack Steffen. Also stepping up: Nathan Ake, Oleksandr Zinchenko, Fernandinho, Jack Grealish, Gabriel Jesus and Raheem Sterling. Ederson, Aymeric Laporte, Ilkay Gundogan, Riyad Mahrez, Rodri and Kevin De Bruyne drop to the bench. De Bruyne, a fitness doubt having required stitches in his foot, has at least made the bench; Kyle Walker is absent entirely.\nLiverpool recall their big guns. Mohamed Salah, Sadio Mane, Thiago, Virgil van Dijk, Andy Robertson, Fabinho and Trent Alexander-Arnold are back. Dropping to the bench: Joe Gomez, Kostas Tsimikas, Joel Matip, James Milner, Diogo Jota, Roberto Firmino and captain Jordan Henderson.\n\n\n\n 2.31pm  \nThe teams\n\nManchester City: Steffen, Joao Cancelo, Stones, Ake, Zinchenko, Bernardo Silva, Fernandinho, Grealish, Foden, Gabriel Jesus, Sterling.Subs: Dias, Gundogan, Laporte, Rodri, De Bruyne, Mahrez, Ederson, Delap, Lavia.\nLiverpool: Alisson, Alexander-Arnold, Konate, van Dijk, Robertson, Keita, Fabinho, Thiago, Salah, Diaz, Mane.Subs: Milner, Firmino, Gomez, Henderson, Jones, Jota, Tsimikas, Matip, Kelleher.\nReferee: Michael Oliver (Northumberland).\n\nUpdated at 2.45pm BST\n\n\n 2.00pm  \nPreamble\n\nThere\u2019s barely a cigarette paper between them in the Premier League, there\u2019s a fair chance they could meet in the Champions League final, and now Manchester City and Liverpool take each other on in the semi-final of the FA Cup. If this is half as good as last weekend\u2019s showdown in the Premier League, we\u2019ll be doing well, and nobody would mind too much if we get treated to extra time and penalties. Well, maybe both managers and all the players, with both clubs facing a hectic end-of-season schedule, but you can\u2019t please everyone. Kick-off at Wembley is at 3.30pm. It\u2019s on!\n\n\n"

                    "body": "Marcus Smith believes his Six Nations experiences with England, coping with the high-pressure visits to Paris and Murrayfield, have boosted his confidence that Harlequins can take the fight to Montpellier in the first leg of their Champions Cup last-16 tie on Sunday. After starring for an hour in Harlequins\u2019 41-14 win at London Irish on Sunday, when he set up two of his team\u2019s seven tries, the in-form Smith recognises that a squad with 14 French internationals and two World Cup winners in their ranks are not to be underestimated.  \u201cIt\u2019s the biggest tournament in Europe for a club player,\u201d he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to just take part, we want to win the silverware. We\u2019ve got to fight as they\u2019re a brilliant team and they\u2019re going to throw everything at us.\u201d Montpellier are top of the French Top 14 but stumbled into the last 16 of Europe\u2019s premier club competition, finishing seventh in their group. Quins won all four of their pool games but Smith knows they will have to raise their game. \u201cI know it\u2019ll be the best version of Montpellier,\u201d he said. \u201cAs a group we\u2019re excited for that challenge. We\u2019ll try to take them out of their comfort zone and throw something at them they haven\u2019t seen before. \u201cThat\u2019s the one positive of this group. We\u2019re not fazed by anyone, we back ourselves as individuals and as a group. We\u2019ll work hard this week to put out a cohesive performance, and try to score as many points [as we can] then worry about the second leg. If we can go down there and score four tries we give ourselves a brilliant chance coming back to the Stoop.\u201d  The confidence Smith so effortlessly exudes is what has endeared him to the English public and his dazzling skillset carried Harlequins to a thrilling Premiership victory last year. However, a disappointing return in the Six Nations offered valuable lessons that can only be derived from defeat. \u201cI learned a lot from playing in high-pressure environments like away at Murrayfield and away in France,\u201d Smith said, recalling two of the three losses that consigned England to third in the championship. \u201cThey were both tough places to go and I learned a lot of lessons about myself, as well as how we can improve as a group. \u201cFirst and foremost about my mentality going to these places. You get a lot of stick as an Englishman at Murrayfield. I didn\u2019t realise. Maybe I was a bit naive going up there and thinking it would be plain sailing. It was a tough Test match. \u201cI learned about how to control myself in big moments, pressure moments, which I will try to bring back here, hopefully for knockout games with Harlequins.\u201d Along with Eddie Jones\u2019s overall strategy, England\u2019s attack was heavily criticised after the tournament. Smith said he took that to heart as the team\u2019s fly-half, which is why he has relished his return to the familiar environment of his club. \u201cWhen I first came back after our week off, the energy was brilliant, the vibe was brilliant and it was a pleasure to be back,\u201d he said, crediting the recent break he took in Dubai after his time with England. \u201cIt took me a couple of days in training to get the calls right and get the timing right off the boys.\u201d  His relationship with Danny Care inside him, as well as with the aggressive ball-carriers off his shoulder in Alex Dombrandt and Andr\u00e9 Esterhuizen, came to the fore against Irish. That 8-9-10-12 axis has been at the heart of Harlequins\u2019 recent success. Add in Joe Marchant, a constant threat running a spate of threatening lines, and the reigning Premiership champions have one of the most potent attacks in Europe. \u201cIt was an absolute joy to step back into training and play the Quins way, which is what I\u2019ve been doing since I was 14,\u201d Smith said of the free-flowing rugby that has become a hallmark of a team whose style is the antithesis of England under Jones."

                    "body": "  10.44pm    Right, that\u2019s it from me. Thanks for your emails and tweets. It\u2019s been quite the night. Until next time. Bye!      10.43pm   Ewan Murray on Celtic\u2019s title and the man that won steered the ship       10.42pm         10.39pm   Internazionale are Coppa Italia champions! Full-time: Juventus 2-4 Inter!  Last season\u2019s Scudetto winners are this season\u2019s cup champs! Perisic\u2019s double in extra time proves decisive. Two points shy of Milan in the Serie A standings, the domestic double is still on.     Updated at 11.04pm BST    10.37pm    Pep Guardiola also confirms that Fernandinho has a problem, to compound City\u2019s defensive problems. Laporte is also struggling, says the Man City manager.      10.28pm   Premier League match reports!          10.27pm   Half-time in extra time: Juventus 2-4 Internazionale  Speaking of fellas with an excellent weak foot, Ivan Perisic has scored twice in extra time to give Inter a two-goal cushion in the Coppa Italia final! The first a penalty and the second an absolute ripper with his left!     Updated at 10.47pm BST    10.25pm   Kevin De Bruyne speaks!   Yeah, a pretty nice evening. When you score four goals, it\u2019s special. It should have been five! We could have scored more. It was impressive. My right is my stronger foot, but I\u2019m never afraid to shoot with my left. We know we have a bit of an advantage [over Liverpool] but we need to recover and be ready for West Ham.  Madrid is very difficult to explain. It was a mad five minutes. It\u2019s not that we played bad. I don\u2019t know what happened. I was out of control on the bench. It\u2019s not nice but we need to move on.  I play between a No 8 and a No 10. My favourite goal was the third one tonight. It was the cleanest hit, the purest.       10.13pm    The only downside for City is a potential injury to Laporte. City\u2019s defence is already stretched, and now they could be without their Spanish international for Sunday\u2019s trip to West Ham.      10.10pm   Full-time: Wolves 1-5 Manchester City  City are three clear of Liverpool at the top of the table and crucially they dramatically improve their goal difference, which could yet be decisive. De Bruyne is serenaded by the away support. What a performance, four goals!     Updated at 10.20pm BST    10.06pm    Wolves 1-5 Manchester City: De Bruyne rattles the post! So close to his FIFTH goal of the evening and City\u2019s 95th goal of the season. As if they are going to add Haaland to this. Crikey. Gabriel Jesus on the bench, not needed tonight.     Updated at 11.06pm BST    10.02pm   End of 90 minutes: Juventus 2-2 Internazionale  We\u2019re into extra time in the Coppa Italia final! A thriller at the Stadio Olimpico in Rome.     10.01pm   GOAL! Wolves 1-5 Manchester City (Sterling 84)  Sterling does get his goal, just moments after his woeful miss! This was a tricky fixture for City, with Wolves chasing European qualification, but they have made light work of it. A devastating City counter-attack, starting with one-touch stuff in their own half, and finishing as Grealish feeds Cancelo, who crosses for Sterling at the back post.    Updated at 10.07pm BST    9.57pm   GOAL! Juventus 2-2 Internazionale (Hakan Calhanoglu 80)  Hakan Calhanoglu levels from the spot! It\u2019s all square in the Coppa Italia final!    Updated at 10.05pm BST    9.55pm    Wolves 1-4 Manchester City: A shocking miss from Sterling! Not that it matters much, but really is mesmerising how the 27-year-old failed to tap in at the back post after Foden\u2019s pinpoint cross from the left. Instead, the ball bobbles under Sterling\u2019s foot and dribbles wide. Moments later, De Bruyne picks up a yellow card for cynically stopping a Wolves counter-attack. I\u2019d say it was a blot on his performance, but Pep will probably regard that as a very good foul to concede as City were outnumbered. Grealish comes on for Foden, and gets a \u2018warm\u2019 welcome on his return to the West Midlands.      Updated at 10.30pm BST    9.50pm    St Johnstone\u2019s win over Aberdeen tonight means Dundee have been relegated from the Scottish Premiership.     9.48pm    Leeds\u2019 Kalvin Phillips has come out to face the cameras:   It was very difficult. You can see from our performance that we were very tired from Arsenal. We dug deep. I don\u2019t know whether it\u2019s nerves. The pressure is on though, we know that. From inside the camp, we\u2019re always trying to stay positive. But we played a world-class team tonight. All we can do it look forward to the Brighton game, and try and rest. The performances haven\u2019t been good enough this season, but we\u2019ve got to try and make the fans happy.       9.45pm    Wolves 1-4 Manchester City: Foden hits the post! De Bruyne turns provider this time. He always seems to choose the right option. Wolves defenders are drawn to the run of Bernardo Silva on the right, but De Bruyne goes left with Foden in acres of space. The Englishman is clean through, steadies himself, and finds the foot of the near post. The ball rebounds out, and Wolves clear. Foden really should have scored there. He had all the time in the world to find the right finish and got it wrong (by about an inch).      9.39pm   Full-time: Leicester 3-0 Norwich  An easy win for the Foxes in a dead rubber. James Maddison netted a lovely third goal for Leicester.      9.37pm   Full-time: Watford 0-0 Everton  This is how things stand at the bottom.       9.36pm   GOAL! Wolves 1-4 Manchester City (De Bruyne 60)   Stop it, Kevin. De Bruyne\u2019s FOURTH goal of the night. He is single-handedly dragging City three points clear at the top. His least impressive goal of the night, picking up the scraps to sidefoot it home after Foden\u2019s cross was botched by Boly.     Updated at 9.40pm BST    9.33pm    Watford 0-0 Everton: It\u2019s been a pretty dull performance from Everton. The game is now into stoppage time. It\u2019s a point gained for the Toffees but it\u2019s pretty turgid stuff at Vicarage Road.      9.31pm   GOAL(S)! Juventus 2-1 Internazionale  Juve score two in two minutes to turn the Coppa Italia final around. Dusan Vlahovic scores the second, after Alex Sando had scored the equaliser for the Old Lady.       9.29pm    In other news, Manchester United Under-18s have won the FA Youth Cup, beating Nottingham Forest 3-1 at Old Trafford in front of 67,000!      Updated at 11.19pm BST    9.28pm   Full-time: Leeds 0-3 Chelsea  Chelsea should have third place sewn up with that. For Leeds, it was a miserable evening. Two games to go and they look favourites to go down.      9.27pm    Ange Postecoglou speaks!   I\u2019m lost for words. An enormous effort. Nobody gave us much of a chance at the start of the year. It\u2019s massive. Fans had a tough year last year, not just because they didn\u2019t win anything, but also because [of Covid]. Our football has been outstanding. I couldn\u2019t been more proud of them. It was a bit nervy, that\u2019s only natural. We got the job done.       9.24pm    Celtic captain Callum McGregor: \u201cIt means everything to me. The players and the manager have been absolutely first class.\u201d  Here\u2019s our match report from Tannadice:   Updated at 9.49pm BST    9.21pm   CELTIC ARE CHAMPIONS! Full-time: Dundee United 1-1 Celtic  Ange Postecoglou\u2019s side seal the title with the draw! After Rangers\u2019 triumph last season, the Scottish title in back in the hands of the Hoops!      Updated at 10.31pm BST    9.19pm    Dundee United 1-1 Celtic: The visitors are just two minutes away from sealing the title, although they are living dangerously, as United flash an effort past the post!      9.17pm   GOAL! Leeds 0-3 Chelsea (Lukaku 83)  Lukaku has his goal that his performance has threatened, although he very nearly made a meal of the finish. Werner crosses low to the Belgian, who really should have finished first time but instead took a touch, or rather about five of them, on the six-yard box. Leeds defenders furiously throw themselves in front of Lukaku but the big No 9 takes his time before driving his shot into the roof of the net!     Updated at 9.30pm BST    9.14pm    \u201cOk KdB is quite good,\u201d emails Tony Porter, \u201cbut when it comes to twofootedness he doesn\u2019t get the prize until he takes corners with either foot like Santi Cazorla.\u201d Correct.      9.11pm    Leeds 0-2 Chelsea: Raphinha down, with a suspected injury. He\u2019s clutching his hamstring. This night could not really get worse for Leeds. Dan James will be suspended for the rest of the season, and they can\u2019t afford their best attacker to be sidelined. They need the Brazilian for the last two games, and it looks like he\u2019s going to be OK, although it looks like Marsch is going to sub him off as a precaution. Yep, he\u2019ll come off for Gelhardt. A penny for Raphinha\u2019s thoughts. Rumours of a move to Barcelona continue to grow, and he\u2019ll certainly be off if Leeds are indeed relegated.    Updated at 9.19pm BST    9.06pm   GOAL! Leicester 2-0 Norwich (Vardy 62)  That\u2019s the 150th league goal of Vardy\u2019s career. The 35-year-old has still got it. And by it, I mean bags of pace, as he races beyond Hanley and finishes nicely with his left foot. Harvey Barnes\u2019s second assist of the night.     Updated at 9.24pm BST    9.04pm   Half-time: Wolves 1-3 Manchester City  This is how things stand at the top. An absolutely outrageous half of football from Kevin De Bruyne.       9.03pm   GOAL! Dundee United 1-1 Celtic (Levitt 72)  A sensational goal from Levitt, who lashes a swirling, dipping drive right into the corner from more than 25 yards out! Celtic are still on to confirm the title tonight, as they just need a draw, but things have got a bit more nervy now! Levitt has previous from range, by the way.      Updated at 9.14pm BST    9.00pm   GOAL! Leicester 1-0 Norwich (Vardy 54)  Leicester have the lead their dominance deserves. Vardy latches onto Barnes\u2019 through ball and his deflected strike bobbles over Gunn.    Updated at 9.09pm BST    8.55pm    Leicester 0-0 Norwich: The Foxes are dominant but can\u2019t find the breakthrough. Norwich are holding firm. If only they could have shown this resilience earlier this season.      8.54pm    Watford 0-0 Everton: Great save from Foster! Everton are pressing for the opener, but Watford\u2019s 39-year-old stopper flies to his left to keep out a deflected Richarlison effort.      8.52pm   Half-time: Juventus 0-1 Internazionale  Inter are halfway to winning the Coppa Italia final!      8.51pm   GOAL! Leeds 0-2 Chelsea (Pulisic 55)  Surely that is game over? Chelsea break down the right, James feeds Jorginho inside. The Italian slips it through to Mount, who flicks around the corner to Pulisic and the American has all the time in the world to pick his spot from the edge of the area. Meslier didn\u2019t move! Pulisic\u2019s compatriot, Marsch, looks a beaten man.      Updated at 9.01pm BST    8.48pm   GOAL! Wolves 1-3 Manchester City (De Bruyne 24)  The geezer is absolutely ridiculous. It\u2019s a goal out of absolutely nothing, and all of his own making. De Bruyne nicks the ball from Neves, drives into the space and unleashes a howitzer low into the bottom corner with his left foot, before dropping the Haaland celebration for good measure. Well, I guess that wins the weaker foot argument. That\u2019s a 17-minute hat-trick from the Belgian, and his first since 2011 when playing for Genk.     Updated at 9.56pm BST    8.42pm   GOAL! Dundee United 0-1 Celtic (Giakoumakis 53)  Celtic will surely be crowned champions tonight, now! Giakoumakis breaks the deadlock, and now have a lead when all they need is a draw. Postecoglou stands stoically on the sidelines as the Celtic fans go mental in the away end.      Updated at 9.06pm BST    8.40pm   Half-time: Watford 0-0 Everton  It\u2019s not the result Frank Lampard will want, but with Leeds losing, could be another crucial point in their relegation battle.      8.38pm   Half-time: Leicester 0-0 Norwich.  It\u2019s been a poor game at the King Power. Jamie Vardy has been quiet. His wife, however, has had quite the day.       8.36pm    Wolves 1-2 Manchester City: De Bruyne is running the show. It\u2019s not just his two goals. This is a masterclass of a performance. The best midfielder in the world, for my money. Nobody in old gold can get near him.      8.34pm   GOAL! Wolves 1-2 Manchester City (De Bruyne 16)  City are ahead once more! De Bruyne again makes the difference. Wolves just can\u2019t contain City\u2019s No 17, who makes a break from deep, flicks the ball towards Sterling. The Englishman can\u2019t reach the ball, which rebounds off an outrushing Jos\u00e9 S\u00e1, and De Bruyne gobbled up the rebound: his strike deflecting into the top corner from around the penalty spot. City have their three-point lead again at the top of the table, if things finish like this.     Updated at 11.09pm BST    8.30pm    Pedro Neto is a Champions League-caliber footballer and I will not hear otherwise. It\u2019s great to see him in good form again after his injury.      8.29pm   GOAL! Wolves 1-1 Manchester City (Dendoncker 11)  We have ourselves a game! A breathtaking counter-attack from Wolves punishes the league leaders. Jimenez wins the ball in midfield and releases Pedro Neto down the left. The Portuguese speedster flies into the City box and lays the perfect cut back to Dendoncker, who makes up 50-60 yards to finish first time from the edge of the foot. A sidefoot which keeps low and avoids both Ederson and Fernandinho on the line!      Updated at 8.38pm BST    8.26pm    Who has the better weak foot? Son Heung-min or Kevin De Bruyne?     8.24pm   GOAL! Wolves 0-1 Manchester City (De Bruyne 7)  A huge goal at the top of the table! Manchester City are on course to go three points clear of Liverpool again! It\u2019s a brilliant goal by De Bruyne, who plays a neat one-two with Bernardo Silva, before drilling a left-footed shot across Jos\u00e9 S\u00e1. The weight on the pass from Bernardo Silva there was delicious.     Updated at 8.41pm BST    8.21pm   Half-time: Leeds 0-1 Chelsea  The Blues are in complete control. I\u2019m pleased to say the supporter that caused a three-minute delay earlier in the half is conscious and being treated by the medical staff.      8.18pm   Peeeeeeep!  Wolves v Manchester City has started.      8.17pm   Half-time: Dundee United 0-0 Celtic  Remember, Celtic only need a draw tonight to seal the Scottish Premiership title!      8.16pm   GOAL! Rangers 2-0 Ross County (Tavernier 29 pen)  Goal No 18 for the season for the right back.      8.15pm   GOAL! Juventus 0-1 Internazionale (Barella 6)  Inter take the lead in the Coppa Italia final! Barella whips a R2 finish into the corner from outside the box. What a goal!    Updated at 8.30pm BST    8.13pm    Leeds 0-1 Chelsea: A break in play, as there seems to be a medical emergency in the crowd. Let\u2019s hope for good news.      8.10pm    Leeds 0-1 Chelsea: Things going from bad to worse for Leeds. A goal down, a man down, and now Jack Harrison is going to have to go off. The Englishman is clutching his hamstring. On comes Firpo.      8.09pm    Watford 0-0 Everton: Chance for Iwobi, who sees an effort deflected behind for a corner. A good game, though, at Vicarage Road.      8.07pm   GOAL DISALLOWED!  Leeds 0-1 Chelsea: Lukaku has a strike chalked off. A really cute finish from the Belgian, who nicely lobbed Meslier after being sent clean through, but is correctly ruled offside. two minutes later, Lukaku glances a Reece James cross just wide of the far post. The big man looks like he\u2019s got his mojo back after his two goals at the weekend.    Updated at 8.12pm BST    8.04pm    Leeds 0-1 Chelsea: Kovacic is going to have to be withdrawn. That \u2018tackle\u2019 by James has left the midfielder unable to continue. He is subbed off for Loftus-Cheek. Half an hour gone.      8.02pm   GOAL! Rangers 1-0 Ross County (Wright 13)  Rangers are doing all they can but remain six points and now just 19 goals behind Celtic with two to play. Wright pokes home from close range following a flick on from Goldson at a corner.   Updated at 9.17pm BST    7.58pm    Dundee United 0-0 Celtic: Meanwhile, in Scotland \u2026      7.57pm   RED CARD! Dan James is sent off! Oh, Leeds!  A straight red for the Welshman, who made an awful challenge on Kovacic. James looks shocked at the dismissal, but there\u2019s no doubt that it was a dangerous tackle. James caught Kovacic high, half-way up the shin and flew in with some force. Could easily have been a leg breaker, but Kovacic is luckily going to be OK to continue. Marsch looks absolutely bereft but perhaps it is at the actions of his attacker. There was no need for him to make that tackle, which was in Chelsea\u2019s half. The Blues should walk this now. One-nil up, and playing 10 men.    Updated at 8.02pm BST    7.51pm    Leeds 0-1 Chelsea: The home side have settled somewhat. They earn a free-kick on the edge of Chelsea\u2019s box but the Blues bat away the cross. Remember Leeds did score from a corner against Arsenal. With 10 men! Hope remains.  \u201cI wonder if Jesse Marsch\u2019s halftime talk will be inspired by JFK\u201d, emails Peter Oh. \u201cAsk not what your counter press can do for you, ask what you can do for your counter press!\u201d     7.49pm    Dundee United 0-0 Celtic: After a busy start by the visitors, United have been growing into the game at Tannadice. Joe Hart has just been for a walkabout to the half-way line to stop a Dundee United counter-attack.    Updated at 7.58pm BST    7.47pm   Peeeeeeep!  The 7.45pm kick offs are also underway.  Leicester v Norwich Watford v Everton  There\u2019s also an interesting game in Germany, with Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach playing Ukraine\u2019s national team in a friendly fundraiser. Here\u2019s some more background, courtesy of the Bundesliga website:  It will be Ukraine\u2019s first fixture since Russia\u2019s invasion and will not only raise money to help Ukrainians suffering as a result of the war, but also serve as a warm-up for the team\u2019s FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022 semi-final play-off against Scotland on 1 June. Ukraine nationals wishing to attend the game will be able to do so free of charge, and the senior international team will be official guests of Gladbach after the game, staying at Borussia Park\u2019s on-site hotel and using the club\u2019s training ground from 10-12 May. \u201cWe\u2019re very happy to be able to help the Ukrainian FA through this game, and hope that as many football fans as possible from all over the country come to the stadium and make a donation to a good cause by buying a ticket to the match. All Ukrainian citizens will have free entry to the game,\u201d said Borussia chief executive, Stephan Schippers.      7.44pm    \u201cOut of curiosity, any clue as to why there are markings on the Leeds pitch?\u201d asks Martin Shields via email. \u201cIs it simply to tell the Leeds players where to stand while Chelsea works the ball around and through them?\u201d That will be the Challenge Cup semi-final at Elland Road last week. Maybe Leeds could have lined a few of those league lads on the goalline tonight.      7.42pm    Leeds 0-1 Chelsea: You fear for Leeds. They look so nervy. Mount sees another shot blocked after good work from Pulisic down the left. The home side have had just 35% possession in these opening 10 minutes.    Updated at 7.56pm BST    7.38pm    Leeds 0-1 Chelsea: A woeful start from Leeds, whose gameplan has presumably gone out of the window in the first few minutes. Lukaku will be relishing the opportunity to bag a few goals tonight. Chelsea look like they are in the mood. Kovacic threatens to walk through the Leeds defence, before a crucial tackle from Phillips puts a stop to the Croatian.      7.36pm   GOAL! Leeds 0-1 Chelsea (Mount 4)  Well that didn\u2019t take long! James (Reece, not Dan) finds some space on the right, drives into the box and lays the ball back to Mount, who comes onto it at pace and his a first-time pearler, which curls into the top corner. Could Meslier have done better at his near post? Probably not, that was right in the postage stamp. A sumptuous finish. Mount holds his hands to his ears to the home faithful. They aren\u2019t exactly impressed.     Updated at 10.53pm BST    7.31pm   Peeeeeeeep!  We\u2019re underway in the 7.30pm kick offs, which include Leeds v Chelsea and Dundee United v Celtic.      7.21pm   More team news!

Subs: Ake, Gabriel Jesus, Grealish, Steffen, Mahrez, Egan-Riley, Mbete-Tabu, Palmer, Lavia. City\u2019s well documented defensive problems mean that Fernandinho, 37 years young, starts at centre back tonight. He hasn\u2019t played there since 2020.      7.19pm    Watford manager Roy Hodgson, soon to be former Watford manager Roy Hodgson, did this at Crystal Palace on Saturday; one of the funniest moments of this season for me.   The Hornets named their new manager today. Rob Edwards joins from Forest Green Rovers from next season. Frank Lampard and Everton will be hoping for a simple three points tonight.       7.10pm    It\u2019s a big night for Lewis Bate. The 19-year-old spent 10 years at Chelsea, in the academy, but never featured for the first team. He joined Leeds last summer for \u00a31.5m and tonight is his first Premier League start. His only other Premier League appearance, against West Ham in January, involved him coming on as sub in the 22nd minute before being subbed off just after the hour mark. Eeeesh. The lad must have done something good in training to convince Marsch he is right to face his former club tonight.    Updated at 7.12pm BST    7.02pm     I have hundreds of quotes I use at different moments. I try to think how they fit with who I am and how we play football. I love quotes, learning from people of the past. Sports figures, historical figures, whatever. The key is understanding what messages to use at the right time. I use things that resonate with me \u2026 there are historical figures, Gandhi, Mother Teresa, presidents like John F Kennedy.  Jesse Marsch has been on fine form prior to Leeds\u2019 big game tonight. Unsurprisingly, it formed the main part of the Fiver tonight.       6.54pm   Team news  Leeds v Chelsea Leeds: Meslier, Llorente, Koch, Cooper, Struijk, Harrison, Raphinha, Bate, Phillips, James, Rodrigo.

You lucky, lucky things. With the exception of Leicester v Norwich, which is a stone-cold dead rubber, all of the Premier League fixtures tonight have something juicy riding on them. Namely, of course, the league title with Manchester City looking to re-establish their three point advantage over Liverpool with a trip to Europe-chasing Wolves.  That\u2019s the late-kick off. The early one is a fixture that screams 1960s: Leeds v Chelsea. Simply put, it is a humungous game at Elland Road, with Leeds\u2019 woeful goal difference meaning they will need to better Burnley and Everton in the final three games of the season \u2013 Everton travel to already-doomed Watford tonight. Brighton and Brentford should provide easier tests for Leeds but it is an excellent time to play Chelsea, who are now in danger of spectacularly blowing it. Tuchel has gone into crisis mode.    Elsewhere, we\u2019ll also be reporting on fitba, with Celtic able to wrap up the title tonight at Dundee United. It really is a formality, with the Bhoys leading Rangers by six points and 20 goals with two games remaining, but a draw or win tonight (or if Rangers fail to win) will rubber-stamp the trophy for Ange Postecoglou and co.

                    "body": "  3.03pm   Closing summary  Senior MPs on the Treasury committee are grilling Jeremy Hunt, the UK chancellor, on the autumn statement and the economy. My colleague Andrew Sparrow is watching and live blogging here:  Our main stories today: Strikes by postal workers around Black Friday and in the run-up to Christmas are to go ahead after their union rejected a pay offer that Royal Mail said was final. Members of the Communication Workers Union (CWU) will strike for 48 hours on Thursday and Friday and on 30 November and 1 December, and will also carry out single days of action on 9, 11, 14, 15 and 23 December and on Christmas Eve.  Meanwhile, the UK transport secretary, Mark Harper, will meet the union leader Mick Lynch on Thursday for the first time for urgent talks to try to call off rail strikes over the festive period. The RMT general secretary defended the industrial action after critical newspaper reports painted him as \u201cthe Grinch who stole Christmas\u201d. Lynch said: \u201cI\u2019m not the Grinch. I\u2019m a trade union official, and I\u2019m determined to get a deal.\u201d  The Glazer family has been urged by Manchester United fans to sell quickly and to make sure they leave the Premier League club in the right hands rather than chasing the biggest bid.In an open letter, the Manchester United Supporters Trust also warns the Glazers that any sort of uncertainty could be \u201cdisastrous\u201d and tells them \u201cit\u2019s time for a change\u201d. It comes after reports the Americans want at least \u00a36bn for a club they bought in 2005.    Our other stories:          Thank you for reading. We\u2019ll be back tomorrow. Take care! \u2013 JK     2.53pm    Earlier, official US figures showed a better-than-expected rise in durable goods orders of 1% in October.  Andrew Hunter, senior US economist at Capital Economics, said:  The solid 1.0% m/m rise in durable goods orders in October indicates that business equipment investment continues to hold up reasonably well in the face of higher borrowing costs, helped by a boost to transport investment from easing supply shortages. Nevertheless, we doubt that resilience will continue indefinitely.      2.51pm   US business downturn deepens in November  November saw a solid contraction in business activity across US businesses, according to a business survey.  The headline flash US PMI composite output index from S&amp;P Global fell to 46.3 in November, from 48.2 at the start of the fourth quarter. The rate of contraction signalled was the sharpest since August and among the quickest since 2009. Lower output was seen across both manufacturing and service sectors amid increasingly steep declines in demand. The overall fall in activity was the second-fastest since May 2020 as inflation, rising borrowing costs and economic uncertainty weighed on demand.       2.24pm   CWU asks for improved pay deal and guarantee of no compulsory redundancies  CWU has issued its statement, saying postal workers are warning the public of the \u201cend of Royal Mail as we know it,\u201d as 115,000 employees will strike over the next two days.  The union rejected the company\u2019s \u201cbest and final offer,\u201d and accused it of turning the business into a \u201cgig economy-style parcel courier, reliant on casual labour\u201d. It said the proposals entailed thousands of compulsory redundancies, cuts to sick pay, later start and finishing times, no job security commitments and a \u201cwholly inadequate, non-backdated 3.5% pay increase\u201d. In response, the union is arguing for the following proposals to help resolve the dispute:  An improved 18 month pay deal including back pay for all workers; A guarantee of no compulsory redundancies; The restoration of previously agreed processes for voluntary redundancies; A joint review of all agreements and the relationship between the CWU and Royal Mail Group; Re-establishing the right of CWU reps to be fully involved and able to negotiate on local revisions; An alternative business strategy that would see Royal Mail Group use its competitive advantage to grow as a company, instead of becoming a gig economy parcel employer.   CWU general secretary Dave Ward said:   We are disappointed that instead of reaching a compromise to avoid major disruption, Royal Mail have chosen to pursue such an aggressive strategy. We will not accept that 115,000 Royal Mail workers - the people who kept us connected during the pandemic, and made millions in profit for bosses and shareholders \u2013 take such a devastating blow to their livelihoods. These proposals spell the end of Royal Mail as we know it, and its degradation from a national institution into an unreliable, Uber-style gig economy company. Make no mistake about it: British postal workers are facing an Armageddon moment. We urge every member of the public to stand with their postie, and back them like never before.      2.02pm   Royal Mail workers to strike on Black Friday after 'final' pay offer rejected  Royal Mail workers are set to strike over the next couple of days \u2013 the busy Black Friday shopping period \u2013 after talks between the company and the Communication Workers Union (CWU) ended without agreement. Royal Mail said its \u201cbest and final\u201d offer, a pay increase of up to 9% over 18 months, had been rejected, and that the 48-hour strike by 1150,000 postal workers would go ahead. It had previously offered a 7% pay rise over two years.  As part of its offer, the company said it would make Sunday working optional and offer \u201cmore generous\u201d voluntary redundancy terms than initially proposed. It also pledged it would not make any compulsory job cuts until the end of March. There have been months of wrangling over pay and working conditions between Royal Mail and the union. CWU has carried out several strikes in the past few months and has announced plans for a further 10 days of strikes between 24 November and 24 December. Simon Thompson, Royal Mail\u2019s chief executive, said:  Talks have lasted for seven months and we have made numerous improvements and two pay offers, which would now see up to a 9% pay increase over 18 months alongside a host of other enhancements. This is our best and final offer. Negotiations involve give and take, but it appears that the CWU\u2019s approach is to just take. The strikes have already added \u00a3100m to Royal Mail\u2019s losses so far this year. In a materially loss making company, with every additional day of strike action we are facing the difficult choice of about whether we spend our money on pay and protecting jobs, or on the cost of strikes.    Updated at 2.10pm GMT    12.42pm    Alex Dixon, partner at law firm Travers Smith, has looked at whether private equity might be interested in buying Manchester United after the Glazer family put it up for sale.  FSG\u2019s acquisition of and investment in Liverpool remains the benchmark for how long-term, pragmatic investment can lead to rapid growth for heritage sporting assets. Any private equity investment in Manchester United would be predicated on growth over the coming years and that will be a key focus for sponsors. Developing the club in line with fan expectations has been a key factor in recent successful investments in Premier League Clubs.  The Chelsea auction demonstrated how attractive the best football clubs are for PE investors. It remains to be seen whether the price for Manchester United would exceed that of Chelsea by such a degree that it would need a consortium of sponsors, perhaps alongside other forms of capital, to win an auction.   Manchester United have been hugely successful over the past 15 years at leveraging commercial opportunities and so investors will need to carefully assess the ability to further grow those commercial revenues. The Super League situation showed that there are limits on the ability of top clubs to fundamentally change sporting competitions to drive further revenue growth. While a revamp of Old Trafford is certainly a possibility, the amount of revenue that can be earned from a state of the art stadium will only be part of the value proposition for an incoming PE investor.      12.37pm   Scotsman owner says it won't bid for Mirror and Express owner  The owner of the Scotsman and Yorkshire Post has said it will not make a bid for much larger rival Reach, the parent company of the Mirror and Express titles and hundreds of regional newspapers, despite saying it had secured the financial backing for a \u00a3350m-plus takeover. National World, which is listed on the London Stock Exchange with a market value of \u00a351m, said that it had decided not to make a formal offer after deciding that \u201ccircumstances are not aligned\u201d. Earlier this month it emerged that National World, which is run by the former boss of Mirror newspaper group David Montgomery, was in the early stages of exploring a possible offer for Reach. Montgomery, who has long coveted a takeover of his former employer, had not approached the board of Reach, which is valued at \u00a3350m. National World said:  Following further work with its advisers, National World has concluded that while there are considerable industrial and financial advantages to combining the newspaper portfolios of the two companies the circumstances are not aligned to proceed any further with the possible offer. This is despite National World having received in principle financial support from within the investment community to fund a potential deal.  Shares in Reach, which have slumped by more than 60% this year, fell almost 6% on Wednesday as investors reacted to the news that a takeover offer would not be forthcoming. A combination of National World and Reach, which is already the UK\u2019s biggest regional newspaper publisher owning brands including the Liverpool Echo and Manchester Evening News, would likely have faced an investigation by the Competition and Markets Authority. Montgomery said:  A combination with Reach could unlock very significant operational value for both companies, but not all the elements required to ensure a successful transaction were present. Rather than create unwanted management distractions for both companies and our respective shareholders, we have decided not to proceed with any discussions at this stage.   Updated at 2.09pm GMT    12.29pm   Manchester United Supporters Trust urges Glazers to sell quickly  The Glazer family has been urged by Manchester United fans to sell quickly and to make sure they leave the club in the right hands rather than chasing the biggest bid.In an open letter, the Manchester United Supporters Trust also warns the Glazers that any sort of uncertainty could be \u201cdisastrous\u201d and tells them \u201cIt\u2019s time for a change\u201d. It comes after reports the Americans want at least \u00a36bn for a club they purchased in 2005. \u201cThe last 17 years has been characterised by debt and decline \u2013 on-the-field and off it,\u201d the letter from Must states. \u201cThe vast majority of United fans will agree with the conclusion you appear to have also reached \u2013 it\u2019s time for change.  We would like to speak to Manchester United fans around the world about their views on the developments at the club. How do you feel about the team\u2019s future? Would you welcome new ownership of the club?      11.58am    Here\u2019s our full story on the ongoing rail dispute. The transport secretary, Mark Harper, will meet the union leader Mick Lynch for the first time for urgent talks to try to call off rail strikes over the festive period. The RMT general secretary defended the industrial action against critical newspaper reports painting him as \u201cthe Grinch who stole Christmas\u201d. \u201cI\u2019m not the Grinch. I\u2019m a trade union official, and I\u2019m determined to get a deal,\u201d Lynch said. His assistant general secretary, John Leach, said he hoped Harper \u201cputs his shoulder behind the wheel and gets a deal moving\u201d, but warned that if a settlement isn\u2019t reached on Thursday then passengers will face \u201cmore and more disruption\u201d. Meanwhile, the work and pensions secretary, Mel Stride, told Sky News on Wednesday that legislation could be pushed forward \u201cin due course\u201d to ensure a minimum service for passengers and condemned striking workers for putting festive family reunions at risk.   Updated at 2.09pm GMT    11.56am    With UK households braced for the biggest fall in living standards since records began, as food prices continue to soar and many struggle to pay their energy direct debits this winter, four people share why they are taking on a second job. \u2018I\u2019m no better off than when I was on \u00a37,000 a year\u2019 Jo Thompson, a single mother of two from Lincolnshire, usually works a 45-hour week as an NHS senior analyst and team leader by day, earning a salary of \u00a341,000. By night, she is a pizza delivery driver, a job she took on at the end of August. \u201cI now work around 60 hours per week,\u201d the 44-year-old says.   Updated at 11.59am GMT    11.03am    The British manufacturing firm Johnson Matthey plans to cut up to 15% of senior management jobs, in an effort to slash costs as it faces soaring inflation and energy prices.Chief executive Liam Condon said the cuts formed part of plans to simplify the organisation and achieve \u00a3150m in annual savings, the Financial Times reported.  We had an overengineered administrative layer. We need to make sure we have enough [staff] to do the work and we are not top heavy on [managers].   Condon is pushing ahead with a major revamp of the group, which took a hit from a costly exit from its business manufacturing chemicals for electric car batteries this year.     10.35am   RMT: rail passengers face more and more disruption unless deal is reached  Rail passengers will face more and more disruption unless a settlement is reached in the long running dispute over jobs, pay and conditions, a senior union chief has warned. More than 40,000 members of the Rail, Maritime and Transport union across Network Rail and 14 train operating companies are due to strike on December 13-14, 16 -17 and on January 3-4 and 6-7. There will also be an overtime ban across the railways from December 18 until January 2, meaning RMT members be taking industrial action for four weeks. RMT assistant general secretary John Leach said members are \u201cdesperate\u201d and have been left with no option but to take industrial action. He said he hopes UK Transport Secretary Mark Harper \u201cputs his shoulder behind the wheel and gets a deal moving\u201d when he meets with RMT general secretary Mick Lynch on Thursday. Leach told BBC Radio Scotland\u2019s Good Morning Scotland programme:  Let\u2019s hope that the third secretary of state down in England in less than six months has got something better to say than Grant Shapps and Anne-Marie Trevelyan before him and actually puts his shoulder behind the wheel and gets a deal moving. There\u2019s a deal that can be done here, we\u2019re professional negotiators, our members just want a pay rise, they haven\u2019t had one for two or three years and this will be nearly the fourth coming up. They\u2019ve just got to commit themselves to fairness for our members, but if they don\u2019t then we\u2019re going to see more and more disruption like this and we are determined to see this through for our members.  Asked how long strikes could go on for, he said:  We will do what we need to do and take this forward.    Updated at 10.55am GMT    10.22am   \u2018Built on the blood of slaves\u2019: British football fans boycotting World Cup  Thousands of migrant worker deaths and Qatar\u2019s stance on women\u2019s and LGBTQ+ rights have prompted some British football fans to boycott this year\u2019s World Cup. Alex Murphy has found a community through football. His weekends are spent cheering on Ipswich Town, where he holds a season ticket, the Arsenal women\u2019s team near his north London address, or playing five-a-side with his teams: Saka Potatoes and Olympique Mayonnaise. He has watched every World Cup since 2002 and enjoys the inclusivity of the event, which even his mum, who doesn\u2019t really care about football, gets into. But this year, he won\u2019t be tuning in. He made the decision in January, when he became aware that more than 6,500 migrant workers from India, Pakistan, Nepal, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka had died after Qatar embarked on an unprecedented building programme, largely in preparation for the tournament. Murphy was already disappointed that the country, which has a problematic track record with women and LGBTQ+ rights, had won the bid and been given the opportunity to sportswash its image. \u201cI think by not participating in it, you\u2019re partly defining what it is about the game you love,\u201d he says.      10.14am   RMT boss: 'I'm not the Grinch' ahead of fresh rail strikes  The boss of a rail workers union has said he is \u201cnot the Grinch\u201d ahead of planned fresh strikes in the run-up to Christmas and in the New Year. Mick Lynch, general secretary of the RMT Union, said the latest walkouts would \u201cshow how important our members are to the running of this country\u201d. Strikes are planned across four 48-hour periods on 13-14 and 16-17 December, and 3-4 and 6-7 January. Around 40,000 workers will walk out and there is likely to be further disruption in the days before and after the strikes due to trains not being in the right places. Lynch said the latest strikes would \u201csend a clear message that we want a good deal on job security, pay and conditions\u201d. Referring to the children\u2019s book character who tries to cancel Christmas, he said:  I\u2019m not the Grinch. I\u2019m a trade union official and I\u2019m determined to get a deal.       9.57am   IMF urges China to boost Covid vaccinations  The International Monetary Fund has urged China to \u2018recalibrate\u2019 its Covid-19 strategy, including boosting vaccination rates, and to shore up its troubled property sector to restore confidence. In a statement following virtual meetings for its annual review of China\u2019s economic policies, the Washington-based fund said it was maintaining GDP growth forecasts issued in October.  It is forecasting growth of 3.2% this year and 4.4% next year, assuming a gradual lifting of China\u2019s strict zero-Covid policy in the second half of next year. The IMF\u2019s first deputy managing editor Gita Gopinath said:  Although the zero-Covid strategy has become nimbler over time, the combination of more contagious Covid variants and persistent gaps in vaccinations have led to the need for more frequent lockdowns, weighing on consumption and private investment, including in housing. Going forward, a further recalibration of the Covid strategy should be well prepared and include boosting the pace of vaccinations and maintaining it at a high level to ensure that protection is preserved.  Chinese authorities are seeking to contain a fresh spike in Covid infections that has dimmed hopes for a quick reopening of the economy, the world\u2019s second-largest. The fund welcomed authorities\u2019 recent initiatives for China\u2019s slumping property industry, including a loan programme to help complete unfinished homes and allowing forbearance on troubled property loans. Gopinath said:  Building on these efforts, additional robust and well-funded mechanisms are needed for completing troubled unfinished projects and protecting new presale buyers from the risk of non-completion, while forbearance measures should be phased out. These measures will help restore homebuyer confidence and facilitate market-based restructuring.  She stressed the need for structural reforms in the sector and new savings models.      9.37am   UK economy in worst non-Covid downturn since financial crisis \u2013 PMI  UK private sector firms recorded another reduction in business activity in November, the fourth month of decline, while new orders fell at the fastest pace for almost two years, according to a business survey. This points to a deepening recession, and is the worst downturn (excluding Covid lockdown months) since 2009. Chris Williamson, chief business economist at S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence, which compiled the survey, said:  A further steep fall in business activity in November adds to growing signs that the UK is in recession, with GDP likely to fall for a second consecutive quarter in the closing months of 2022. If pandemic lockdown months are excluded, the PMI for the fourth quarter so far is signalling the steepest economic contraction since the height of the global financial crisis in the first quarter of 2009, consistent with the economy contracting at a quarterly rate of 0.4%. Forward-looking indicators, notably an increasingly steep drop in demand for goods and services, suggest the downturn will deepen as we head into the new year. While the recent change of government has resulted in improved business confidence, the business mood remains among the gloomiest seen over the past quarter century amid the numerous headwinds, which include the cost of living crisis, the Ukraine war, steepening export losses (often linked to Brexit), higher borrowing costs, fiscal tightening and heightened political uncertainty. Price pressures meanwhile remain elevated but show further signs of cooling, often linked to weakened demand, which \u2013 combined with the growing recession signals \u2013 suggest that the Bank of England may start to make less aggressive interest rate hikes in the coming months.  The headline seasonally adjusted S&amp;P Global / CIPS flash UK composite output index ticked up to 48.3 in November, from 48.2 in October and signalling a further modest fall in private sector business activity. The index has been below the crucial 50 no-change mark for four months. New orders fell at the fastest pace since January 2021, as squeezed client budgets weighed on demand in both the manufacturing and service sectors. On a more positive note, business expectations for the year ahead rebounded from the 30-month low in October. Many firms mentioned recession worries and increasingly challenging economic conditions, but there were fewer comments citing domestic political uncertainty.   Updated at 11.19am GMT    9.31am   Pets at Home hammered by freight, energy costs  Pets at Home, Britain\u2019s largest pet supplies chain, is also struggling amid rising costs, and its shares fell 4.8% after it posted lower first-half profits. The company has been hammered by a surge in freight and energy costs. Underlying profit before tax fell 9.3% to \u00a359.2m in the six months to 13 October. People are buying fewer toys and other accessories for their dogs amid the cost of living squeeze but are still spending on essentials like food and litter, and on Christmas ranges. Chief executive Lyssa McGowan said:  We are conscious of the macro-economic backdrop and continue to manage the business proactively. The inflationary environment creates pressures for both our customers and the business. We are conscious of the challenges faced by many consumers, and continue to prioritise making pet care as convenient and affordable as possible. We will never let price be a reason not to shop with us.  More people bought pets during the pandemic when they spent more time at home and the pet boom has continued despite the cost of living crisis, although demand for more expensive accessories appears to be fading. Analysts at RBC said:  Pets is starting to see some evidence of consumers trading down, with new customers buying more of the lower price point, grocery products and more own-brand product.  Pets at Home stuck to full-year guidance of an underlying profit of around \u00a3131m. It has 457 stores, many of which also have vet practices and grooming salons.   Updated at 11.03am GMT    9.21am   Halfords targets retirees in recruitment drive for 1,000 roles  Halfords has launched a drive to fill 1,000 technician roles over the next 12 months by targeting more retired and female recruits, as the UK\u2019s tight labour market pushes employers to think up new hiring strategies. Announcing a halving of interim profits as customers cut discretionary spending amid the cost of living crisis, the motoring and cycling retailer warned that its full-year results will be at the lower end of expectations. Its shares fell more than 6% on the news. However, it said inflationary pressures had also driven membership of its motoring loyalty club from drivers keen to cover the soaring cost of running a car. Its chief executive, Graham Stapleton, said: \u201cTo help meet that demand, we are today launching a recruitment drive to fill 1,000 new automotive technician roles over the next 12 months. In particular, we are hoping to attract retirees back into the workforce, as well as increasing the number of women in technician roles.\u201d   Updated at 9.22am GMT    9.20am   Market summary  The FTSE 100 index has advanced 41 points, or 0.56%, to 7,494, while other major European indices are in the red. Germany\u2019s Dax has lost 0.2%, France\u2019s CAC is flat and Italy\u2019s FTSE MiB has edged 0.2% lower. The pound is little changed against the dollar and the euro, trading at $1.1888 and \u20ac1.1528.  Crude oil prices have risen almost 1% with Brent, the global benchmark, at $89.19 a barrel.     9.15am   Eurozone downturn eases as inflation cools  Business activity declined across the eurozone for a fifth month running in November but at a slower pace, according to flash PMI data from S&amp;P Global.  The headline index rose to 47.8 from 47.3 in October, inching closer to the 50 mark that separates contraction from expansion.  Although the rate of decline remained the second strongest since 2013, excluding Covid-19 lockdown months, the intensity of the downturn moderated in response to a reduced rate of loss of new business, fewer supply constraints and a pick-up in business confidence about the year ahead.  Business sentiment nevertheless remained gloomy by historical standards, and demand continued to fall at a steep rate, leading to a pull-back in employment growth during the month. One upside of the weaker demand picture and alleviation of supply constraints was a cooling of price pressures, most notably in the manufacturing sector. Firms\u2019 costs rose at the slowest rate for 14 months, in turn allowing selling price inflation to moderate, albeit with rates of inflation remaining elevated.       9.06am   Credit Suisse forecasts another loss as it embarks on overhaul  Credit Suisse has forecast a pre-tax loss of up to Sfr1.5bn (\u00a31.3bn) in the fourth quarter, citing a \u201csubstantial\u201d slowdown across the industry. A month ago, the embattled lender unveiled sweeping plans to cut 9,000 jobs and to raise billions of pounds from investors in a Saudi-led funding round, following a series of scandals and a \u00a33.5bn loss in the third quarter. Its new boss, Ulrich K\u00f6rner, has been tasked with scaling back the investment bank and slashing costs, with plans to spin it off to focus on wealth management. The Swiss bank said its wealth management division and investment bank were likely to make a loss between October and December. Overall outflows were 6% of assets under management at the end of the third quarter. The Zurich-based bank said:  Credit Suisse began experiencing deposit and net asset outflows in the first two weeks of October 2022 at levels that substantially exceeded the rates incurred in the third quarter of 2022. In wealth management, these outflows have reduced substantially from the elevated levels of the first two weeks of October although they have not yet reversed.      8.50am    And returning to the potential sale of Manchester United, which has been welcomed by fans, the US-listed shares have risen about 10% in pre-market trading. They closed more than 14% higher last night after Sky News was first to report that the Glazer family were considering selling the club, but that left the share price only slightly above its 2012 flotation price of $14. The club\u2019s market value peaked at $4.3bn in 2018. Victoria Scholar, head of investment at interactive investor, says:  Manchester United is trading higher by almost 10% this morning after the Glazer family announced plans to potentially sell the club a day after Cristiano Ronaldo\u2019s departure, which would bring their 17-year ownership to an end. Investors are cheering the news amid hopes that this could be the beginning of a new era for the club after a disappointing performance over the last few years. The expectation is that there could be a number of potential deep pocketed bidders including Sir Jim Ratcliffe who expressed an interest in buying Man U in August. Although the club was recently valued at \u00a33.75bn, the club has the potential to sell for much more than that.  The shares are trading higher by more than 26% so far this year.  Updated at 11.08am GMT    8.47am   Shadow home secretary calls on government to 'get its act together' on rail dispute  More on the rail strikes. Shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper said people have a right to campaign for a fair pay deal but that ultimately a deal is needed. She told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme:   We recognise people have got a right to do everything they can to campaign for a fair pay deal, and they will continue to do so. And people have a right to withdraw their labour and to strike as part of that, and we\u2019ll always support people\u2019s right to be able to do that, but ultimately we need a deal in place, and that is what we\u2019ve been calling for.  She said she wants the government to \u201cget its act together on this\u201d.      8.43am   French business activity declines for first time since early 2021  Business activity in the French private sector shrank for the first time since February 2021, the PMIs showed. The headline flash France PMI composite output index fell below the 50.0 threshold in November to 48.8, from 50.2 in October. Manufacturing production volumes continued to fall during November, for the sixth month in a row, although a fresh drop in service sector activity was the main factor behind the overall contraction.   Updated at 8.44am GMT    8.39am   German private sector contraction eases in November  Germany\u2019s private sector activity continued to decline in November, but there were signs of improvement, the latest flash PMIs from S&amp;P Global indicated.  However, the rate of decline in business activity eased and firms were less pessimistic about the year-ahead outlook. Demand continued to come under pressure from strong inflation, though even on the price front there were some encouraging signs as firms reported the slowest increase in costs for 1 1/2 years and a weaker rise in prices charged for goods and services. Despite falling workplace activity, labour market conditions remained relatively robust.    Updated at 8.45am GMT    7.58am   Rail strikes latest: Ministers to hold talks with union chiefs this week  Ministers will hold talks with rail union chiefs this week to urge them to call off strikes aimed at causing \u201cmaximum disruption\u201d over Christmas. The RMT union announced on Tuesday that thousands of its members working for Network Rail and 14 train operating companies will strike on 13-14 and 16-17 December, causing disruption over six consecutive days in the run-up to Christmas. There will be a further two strikes on 3-4 and 6-7 January. Work and pensions secretary Mel Stride said on TalkTV this morning:  What we need is we need more talking from the unions with the employers and less announcements of strikes.  He said the consequences of the strikes announced by the RMT union in December and January would be \u201cquite serious\u201d, disrupting \u201cmedical appointments, for example, as well as \u201cfamily reunions\u201d over the festive period.  The timing of these strikes are designed to create maximum disruption across the Christmas period. The Secretary of State is actually meeting the rail union leaders later this week, so there is that dialogue occurring. The essential discussions have to occur between the rail operating companies, Network Rail and the unions, and they really should be engaging more on that and working things out between them more vigorously, in my view, than simply rushing off and going into strike action.  Announcing the strikes on Tuesday, the RMT\u2019s general secretary, Mick Lynch, said:   This latest round of strikes will show how important our members are to the running of this country and will send a clear message that we want a good deal on job security, pay and conditions for our people. We have been reasonable, but it is impossible to find a negotiated settlement when the dead hand of government is presiding over these talks.    Updated at 7.59am GMT    7.44am   Introduction: Manchester United shares jump after Glazers put club up for sale  Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the financial markets and the world economy. The Glazer family are looking to sell Manchester United after owning it for 17 years, triggering a 27% jump in the share price to $16.6 in after hours trading on Nasdaq. The Glazers announced last night that they were \u201ccommencing a process to explore strategic alternatives\u201d for the Premier League club, on the same day it was confirmed that Cristiano Ronaldo had left Old Trafford by mutual agreement. A statement from United revealed plans to identify new investment that could lead to a potential sale. The club said the process led by their American owners will consider a number of options \u201cincluding new investment into the club, a sale, or other transactions involving the company\u201d. The Raine Group, which oversaw the sale of Chelsea earlier this year, has been appointed as the exclusive financial adviser. In August, Jim Ratcliffe, the UK\u2019s richest person, expressed an interest in buying United. \u201cIf the club is for sale, Jim is definitely a potential buyer,\u201d a spokesperson for him said. Last month, though, Ratcliffe claimed he had met the Glazers and they did not wish to sell. The club was valued at nearly $2.5bn (\u00a32bn) on the New York stock exchange yesterday, but is expected to fetch at least twice as much if sold. The Glazers took control of United in a \u00a3790m deal in 2005, loading the club with \u00a3500m of debt, and later listed a minority stake, in 2012, but retained control through a dual-class share structure which gives them almost all voting rights. The announcement that they were considering selling comes after years of protest from the fans, chanting \u201cLove United, Hate Glazers\u201d. United has not won the Premier League since 2013 and the fans want to see more investment in the club.  David Cogan, a media executive who negotiated the sale of the Premier League\u2019s TV rights, has been talking about this on BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme.  The owners have said we\u2019ve done our 17 years, we\u2019ve taken out as much as we can, we\u2019re under constant pressure from fans and therefore what we need to do is try to find a buyer at a time when the Premier League looks like it might make more money because lots of people are buying rights and we\u2019ve got the asset value to where we could get it. And what\u2019s really driven that is the differences in value. A year ago Newcastle sold for \u00a3305m. Chelsea sold for \u00a32.5bn plus an additional \u00a31.75bn for reinvestment in the club, nearly \u00a35bn. When you\u2019re Manchester United or you\u2019re Liverpool and you\u2019re the owner of those clubs, you look at those numbers and say we can easily get that, and that\u2019s a huge return on our initial investment.  He said large American hedge funds may be interested in buying the club, noting that they have been buying media rights of sports assets, for example in rugby.  It may well be that all these American hedge funds are looking at football assets believing they are undervalued even at \u00a34bn or \u00a35bn because the Premier League will continue to grow... Most fans are quite happy if the money is coming in.  Roman Abramovich sold Chelsea for \u00a34.25bn to a consortium led by the American businessman Todd Boehly in May. Newcastle United was sold by Mike Ashley for \u00a3305m last October to a consortium led by Saudi Arabia\u2019s Public Investment Fund. Otherwise, the focus today is on the latest flash PMIs for November, closely-watched business surveys, as well as the minutes from the US Federal Reserve\u2019s last meeting when it hiked interest rates as expected by 75 basis points. Most Asian stock markets have gained while oil and the dollar slipped, as rising Covid-19 cases in China triggered fears of fresh lockdowns that could hold back the reopening of the world\u2019s second-biggest economy. European stocks are expected to rise at the open, after they reversed their Monday losses and closed at three-month highs on Tuesday.

                    "body": "The centre cannot hold. All that is pure is gone. They\u2019re shaving Aslan\u2019s mane up there at the Centurion Club in Hemel Hempstead. And it has, of course, been genuinely shocking to see the grand old community game of professional golf, with its deep social ties, the beating heart of our post-industrial towns, reduced so easily to a row of shrugging men in leisure wear doing stuff on their own for money. This is after all the people\u2019s game, or at least the People Like Us game, still played on every cobbled street and in every playground, providing that playground is at least 300 yards wide and fenced from public access; a place where all you need is the ball, the green grass, hundreds of pounds of equipment and not to be in the inner city. Who could have guessed that professional golf would be so vulnerable to greed and self-interest?  Yes, it\u2019s time to laugh at the golfers as they pretend, but also don\u2019t pretend, to care about things. It was hard not to be gripped by the press conference exchanges before the first LIV Golf event this week. The new pop-up circuit is run by Saudi Arabia\u2019s PIF as part of Vision 2030, the cultural project that is also a way of buying influence, outreach and soft power: art, music, sport, a football club. Golf has duly coughed up its own platoon of freelancers and old stagers with a grudge. And it is already a more-ish spectacle. Here is a pin-headed frat boy wrestling with self-interest and social duty. Here is a row of sullen baseball caps looking not just baffled but outraged at being asked actual questions about actual things by that small group of British sports news journalists who are still willing to do this. It may have been an essentially futile exercise, like asking a horse its opinion on the novels of Anthony Trollope. But it was also oddly refreshing, and indeed a surprisingly useful exchange. I don\u2019t propose to analyse here what this might do to the PGA or to discuss in granular detail how all this affects the chances of Holden Buttplug III at the prestigious Stinger Missile Systems Open. Firstly because other people will do this much better. And secondly because in many ways it doesn\u2019t matter. Golf is not a sport with any deep sense of public ownership or social conscience. George Orwell called it \u201can inherently snobbish game, which causes whole stretches of countryside to be turned into carefully guarded class preserves,\u201d and golf has never really done much to prove this is not the case. Its value lies in providing entertainment, otherworldly beauty and a level of sporting difficulty so mind-bogglingly extreme it has a kind of alien quality. Given golf is by its nature an exclusionary, high-cost pursuit, does it really matter where this happens or for whose benefit? As long as a pastel coloured shape is standing on a deep green wash performing a sublime calculus of arc and swing, as long as there\u2019s a fizz and a gasp and the miracle of feel and flight, golf is fulfilling its one public service, which is to provide opaque but compelling TV product.  The obvious counter to this is that seeing the propaganda needs of a bloody regime normalised and explained away by people who run sport degrades our public life. The message is that anything and anyone can be bought. Dress it up in moral relativism. Cash the cheques. On the other hand golf is also providing a service here. Stripped of the pretence that this is all for the fans or has any cultural purpose, it is in effect a refined version of all elite sport. Here is a thing that exists purely to enrich those who control it with no need, unlike other sports, to dress it up or apologise. So we watched as one by one players at the Centurion Club pretended to have sound reasons for joining the breakaway, and then just gave up and effectively said it was for the money. Phil Mickelson looked notably baffled and sweaty, projecting all the calm moral authority of an evangelical Republican presidential candidate squinting into the police cruiser headlights as he\u2019s hauled out of a Las Vegas ditch in a rubber gimp vest. Mickelson said he was, like, really worried about the fate of Jamal Khashoggi, because that was totally bad, and in the same breath talked about how he\u2019s really enjoying hiking and skiing and improving his work-life balance. Lee Westwood talked about people being \u201cscared of change\u201d. Ian Poulter genuinely didn\u2019t seem to understand the questions, although his sponsors EA Sports might struggle to reconcile their own recent statement declaring support for LGBT+ people around the world and issuing \u201ca call for love and joy in the face of hate and bigotry\u201d, while also supporting Poulter as he promotes a country where homosexuality is punishable by imprisonment, torture or execution. In the end most of them basically admitted that this is about personal interest. And in this sense golf is at least offering clarity and the only really honest response for any sport that takes money from a nation-state intent on laundering its reputation. Instead it has become habit, in the style of Amanda Staveley at Newcastle United, to pretend that this is all somehow progressive or iconoclastic or based on spreading happiness.  Openness is what is required. Sport needs a genuine reset in how it deals with its use as a nation-state tool. Until now this has been an open frontier, without policy or guidance or an adequate vocabulary. So we get lost in spin and whataboutery \u2013 the arms trade happens? Is this now the standard? \u2013 not to mention endless exhausting contradictions. Erling Haaland and Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 will preach about human rights, while promoting Abu Dhabi and Qatar. Jos Buttler will wear the Aramco Orange Cap and also a T-shirt covered in slogans about tolerance. We cling to words like \u201csportswashing\u201d, which is too weak and also inaccurate, because this is in the end hard power not tinkering with a reputation. Sport needs to be clear on how far it wishes to go down that road. With their shrugs, their nihilism, their naked self-interest, the golfers of the LIV are at least being honest with us.

                    "body": "The mayors of Liverpool city region and Greater Manchester have written to all 650 MPs in advance of the 33rd anniversary of the Hillsborough disaster on Friday, urging them to support fundamental reforms of the legal system known as the \u201cHillsborough law\u201d. Steve Rotheram and Andy Burnham said in their letter that victims of other disasters suffer the same systemic failures that forced the bereaved Hillsborough families to fight a decades-long campaign against injustice. The Hillsborough law proposals principally are that all public officials, including police officers, should have a legal \u201cduty of candour\u201d; for bereaved families to have full funding for lawyers to represent them at inquests, and for public bodies to sign a charter committing them to fair conduct.  The proposals, supported by families, were developed after the 2014\u201116 second inquest into the deaths of 96 men, women and children at the FA Cup semi\u2011final between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest at Hillsborough on 15 April 1989. However, the government has not passed any of the reforms into law.  Theresa May\u2019s government in 2017 did support one measure, a public advocate for bereaved families, championed by the Labour MP Maria Eagle, but did not introduce it. James Jones, the former bishop of Liverpool, made 25 recommendations that formed the basis for the Hillsborough law proposals, in a 2017 report commissioned by May, but the government has not yet responded to it. Rotheram and Burnham describe that as \u201cdisrespectful to the Hillsborough families\u201d. The 2016 inquest jury found that the 96 people \u2013 now 97, since the death of Andrew Devine, 55, last July \u2013 were unlawfully killed due to gross negligence manslaughter by the South Yorkshire police officer in command, Ch Supt David Duckenfield. The jury also rejected years of allegations by South Yorkshire police officers that Liverpool supporters misbehaved at Hillsborough, and determined that no conduct of the supporters contributed to the disaster.  Despite that verdict, nobody has been legally held to account for causing the 97 unlawful killings, nor for the discredited police case. Duckenfield was acquitted of a criminal charge of gross negligence manslaughter in 2019. Rotheram and Burnham wrote in their letter that injustice is also being suffered by victims of the British army\u2019s 1950s nuclear tests, the contaminated blood scandals, the Grenfell fire and the Manchester Arena bombing.  \u201cThe reason why this pattern keeps on repeating is simple,\u201d their letter states. \u201cThe scales of justice are weighed against ordinary families and in favour of public authorities who hold all the power.\u201d Saying \u201cthe need for a Hillsborough Law is clear\u201d, they wrote: A fundamental re-balancing of the legal, coronial and judicial systems , creating a level playing field for bereaved families with agencies of the state, will prevent future generations experiencing the injustices we have seen in our lifetimes.\u201d A Home Office spokesperson praised the Hillsborough families\u2019 \u201ctremendous courage\u201d, and said: \u201cThe Home Office has been working closely with its partners in the relevant government departments and organisations to carefully consider the points of learning made by Bishop James Jones. Our focus now is engaging with the Hillsborough families and publishing the government\u2019s overarching response to the bishop\u2019s report in due course.\u201d"

The chain halted the offer during the early months of the pandemic but, after a trial earlier this year, is restoring the benefit for its myWaitrose cardholders across its stores next month. The John Lewis Partnership-owned supermarket is restoring the perk after last month reporting declining sales, with shoppers looking to cheaper rivals during the cost-of-living crisis. Its free coffee deal has had a chequered history since its introduction in 2013, with Waitrose in 2015 forced to remind members who wanted to drink their hot drink in one of the cafes of the \u201cetiquette\u201d of buying a snack first.  Long queues eventually pushed the supermarket in 2017 to insist customers make a purchase to get a drink, after the offer gained widespread popularity among students and non-spending visitors. Under the revived offer, MyWaitrose cardholders must make a purchase and bring their own cup to claim a maximum of one hot drink daily. Americanos, lattes (from \u201cgrass-fed\u201d cows), cappuccinos or just a humble cup of tea will be available when the offer relaunches across Waitrose\u2019s 331 UK shops (excluding garages and service stations) from 7 November. Waitrose said its loyalty card-holders would now also be getting a better free coffee, upgrading to premium coffee beans as it announced a new partnership with Caff\u00e8 Nero. Charlotte Di Cello, the commercial director for Waitrose, said: \u201cOur customers loved the myWaitrose free coffee offer, so we\u2019re really excited to bring it back, with premium beans from the Nero Roasting Company.\u201d Will Stratton-Morris, chief executive of Caff\u00e8 Nero UK, which has 650 stores, said it \u201cfeels like a natural collaboration\u201d, with customers of each company getting mutual discounts and benefits. Waitrose last month reported sales falling 5% year on year in the first half to \u00a33.6bn, with operating profit down by more than \u00a390m to \u00a3432m.  According to data from Kantar, shoppers have been moving in droves to discount supermarkets such as Lidl and Aldi, with the latter now having almost double Waitrose\u2019s market share in the UK. The high-end supermarket axed another popular deal for loyalty card holders in February this year, a free newspaper with a \u00a310 spend. A spokesperson said there were no plans to restore that offer."

                    "body": "Australians can expect higher petrol and gas prices and more volatile financial markets as a result of Russia\u2019s aggression towards Ukraine but Australia\u2019s economic rebound is unlikely to be derailed without a major escalation of hostilities, economists say. Russian president Vladimir Putin ordered his nation\u2019s troops into two renegade regions of neighbouring Ukraine on Monday (local time). In response, investors trimmed their exposure to riskier assets. Stock markets in Asia fell, with Australia\u2019s benchmark ASX200 index ending down 1%, while equivalent gauges in Hong Kong earlier lost as much as 3% and Tokyo\u2019s 2%. Oil prices rose 2.8% and touched seven-year highs on Tuesday. Saul Eslake, an independent economist, said rising crude costs were the most obvious initial effect of Russia\u2019s actions against Ukraine.  \u201cThe world might assume that Russian oil will not be available to the market either because the Russians choose not to make it available or the West chooses not to buy it or in some other way impedes the trade in oil,\u201d Eslake said. Local petrol prices are already at record highs, reaching a national average of $1.791 cents per litre in the week to 20 February. In New South Wales on Tuesday, prices were averaging $1.816 a litre for E10 petrol, while in Melbourne E10 was $1.727 a litre. As investors become more jittery, the Australian dollar also tends to fall against the US dollar, Eslake said. Since commodities are typically priced in the US currency, the price of oil in local terms will also be higher, once the delay of about a week feeds through. Gas prices may also increase. While most of Australia\u2019s liquefied natural gas (LNG) exports are based on long-term contracts to Asian customers, there may be a spike in regional prices if Qatar \u2013 the world\u2019s second largest LNG exporter behind Australia \u2013 diverts shipments to Europe to cover for Russian shortfalls, Eslake said. Gas\u2019s share of Australia\u2019s electricity market has been declining as renewables push out fossil fuels. Still, to the extent gas sets electricity prices, a higher cost of that fuel would also translate into higher wholesale power prices. However, Gareth Aird, head of Australian economics at Commonwealth Bank, said the turmoil in Europe was unlikely to have a material impact on the national economy beyond the short-term fizz in financial and commodity markets. \u201cIn terms of what is going to be driving the macro Aussie economy this year, [the European tension] is not going derail that,\u201d Aird said. The drivers include the tight labour market, households loaded up with savings, and rising inflation and wages. \u201cThe story of the Aussie economy is pretty much locked in this year and that stuff overseas won\u2019t impact our domestic conditions,\u201d he said. Eslake agreed, adding he does not believe the Ukraine situation \u201cwill have any impact on the Reserve Bank\u2019s thinking about the timing or magnitude of rate increases\u201d. The Commonwealth Bank predicts the Reserve Bank of Australia will lift its official cash rate from the record low 0.1% in June. Financial markets have lately pared back expectations of when the first rise will occur but still predict about one percentage point of increases this year. The release of the ABS\u2019s December quarter wage price index figure on Wednesday will likely underscore the dominance of local factors on the economic outlook, Aird said.  \u201cWe think we\u2019ll see an acceleration in wages growth,\u201d he said. In the September quarter, wages rose 0.6% and were 2.2% higher over the year. \u201cWe\u2019re predicting 0.8% [December quarter WPI], the consensus is 0.7%, and the RBA\u2019s implied profile is around 0.6%,\u201d Aird said. While the differences may appear small, they will be closely watched by financial markets, he said. The reserve bank will also be looking at two consumer price index figures before it decides to move on rates, with the first of these likely to be \u201ca red hot print\u201d, Aird said. Card spending data released on Tuesday for the week ending 18 February showed a rebound in spending after a small fall the previous week, the Commonwealth Bank said. \u201cThere are further signs that the economy continues to normalise as new Omicron cases fall. Spending in\u2011store and spending on services both continued to trend higher over the week,\u201d the bank said."

                    "body": "Every year the question is asked: what is the point of the FA Cup, why should we care? This is not the Premier League, with its slick production values, glamorous stars at every turn and sense of dramatic urgency. There\u2019s no great sense that it matters: you lose, you\u2019re out and it has no bearing on the race for fourth. You win the thing and your manager still gets sacked a few days or weeks or months later \u2013 between 2012 and 2018, Ars\u00e8ne Wenger was the only FA Cup-winning manager still to be in his job a year later. Yet it remains a tremendously democratic institution and, amid everything else \u2013 the landmark final, the money it diverts down the pyramid, the chance it offers smaller clubs for a day to mark indelibly in their history (the time we won at Burnley, the afternoon we drew with West Ham, the night we played at Everton \u2026), it offers a reminder of games that used to be. And for fans of a certain age, disillusioned by the transformation of clubs into commercial vehicles or tools of soft power, nostalgia may be the most important thing we have left: it\u2019s the only thing to look forward to \u2013 the past.  It was 44 years ago on Tuesday that Nottingham Forest claimed their first major trophy of the Brian Clough era, winning a League Cup final replay against Liverpool, the team they face in an FA Cup quarter-final on Sunday night. Getting to a replay had been a matter of some fortune. Forest were without three cup-tied players, including Peter Shilton, which meant a start in goal for Chris Woods who, at 18 years and 124 days, remains the youngest goalkeeper to play in a Wembley final. With Colin Barrett injured and John McGovern struggling through with a tight groin, Liverpool dominated but were thwarted by the brilliance of Woods. \u201cHe kept his cool,\u201d wrote John Lawson in the Nottingham Evening Post, \u201crevealed the immense natural talent that he possesses and stole the hearts of a Wembley crowd as well as headline acclaim.\u201d Before the replay at Old Trafford, Clough\u2019s assistant, Peter Taylor, took the squad to Scarborough, ostensibly to relax them, although the trip served a useful secondary function in helping him move some furniture up to an apartment he had bought there. Unorthodox, perhaps, but it stressed that Forest were outsiders, that they did things differently, that they were rebels against the establishment. Clough was somebody who always scorned tactical discussion, but it is remarkable how often at key moments he or Taylor would make a significant tweak. McGovern\u2019s groin was too sore to be risked and so he was replaced by John O\u2019Hare. That pushed John Robertson into a deeper role, giving Forest a more compact shape that helped cut off the supply to Kenny Dalglish, a cautious, patient approach that would offer the blueprint for the European success to come.  Woods made early saves from Phil Neal and Dalglish and Alan Kennedy had an effort ruled out for handball before Robertson got the only goal with a 53rd-minute penalty after Phil Thompson had tripped O\u2019Hare. It was, Thompson admitted, \u201ca professional foul\u201d, and today it would be a clear red card, but Liverpool were furious. \u201cI knew he was outside the area when I kicked him,\u201d Thompson said, while Tommy Smith dismissed the performance of the referee, Pat Partridge, as \u201cbloody ridiculous\u201d and suggested he \u201cshould be shot\u201d. The temptation is to see all this as another world, a knockabout place without VAR when nobody had heard the phrase \u201cdenying a goalscoring opportunity\u201d, when players acted as removal men and frustrated defenders could call for the assassination of referees without fearing some social media warrior might take them seriously, when Nottingham Forest could be a major club. But the modern game was beginning to emerge. As early as 1969, Maurice Edwards had written in the Derby Evening Telegraph of \u201ca super league within Division 1\u201d that was beginning to pull away from the rest.  There were no funds \u2013 hedge, sovereign wealth or public investment \u2013 and no oligarchs, but there was an awareness that as football\u2019s popularity grew and, thanks to Match of the Day and England\u2019s World Cup win, it became mass public entertainment, there was a risk that a self-perpetuating elite would emerge. Edwards was right. He named Liverpool, Leeds \u201cand others\u201d. If you assume by that he meant Arsenal, Everton and Manchester United, 30 of the next 35 league titles would be won by that five-team elite before Roman Abramovich\u2019s Chelsea broke the sequence. Of the other five, one was won by Aston Villa, in 1969 still the joint-third most successful side in English history; one by a Blackburn fuelled by the millions of Jack Walker; two by Derby, once under Clough and once in effect by the team he had left behind; and one by Forest. Clough\u2019s genius held off almost single-handed the emergence of an elite group of super-clubs for a decade.  Forest had no wealthy backers. In 1977, they were run by a committee headed by the chairman, Brian Appleby, a lawyer, and his deputy, Stuart Dryden, a sub-postmaster. Forest were constantly short of cash, which led to the gamble in 1979-80 on building the Executive Stand at a cost of \u00a32.5m. When the signings of Justin Fashanu, Peter Ward and Ian Wallace didn\u2019t work out, the repayments proved a crippling burden. The decline of Forest from European champions to top-six challengers in the 80s tends to be put down to Clough\u2019s falling out with Taylor, and that clearly was a major factor, but so, too, were basic issues of finance. Of course mistakes have been made, some of them major, and, of course, things might have been different had different decisions been taken, but Forest\u2019s post-Clough decline has essentially returned them to the status they held before he took over.  Their improvement under Steve Cooper has brought FA Cup wins over Arsenal and Leicester, already created memories that will be treasured by this generation, but Sunday is the reminder of another time, that more innocent age when one extraordinary manager could still hold back the tides of economic history."

                    "body": "Eddie Jones has challenged Henry Arundell to earn a spot in England\u2019s World Cup squad next year, revealing it took him five minutes to decide the 19-year-old full-back warranted a first call-up. Arundell was among the eye-catching inclusions named on Tuesday in a 36-man training squad for a three\u2011day camp, capping a breakthrough season at London Irish in which he has scored several remarkable tries, including a length-of-the-field effort against Toulon this month.  Jones compared him to Matt Giteau \u2013 the former Australia Test centurion who the England head coach unearthed when in charge of the Wallabies \u2013 and challenged Arundell to bolt into the World Cup squad for France 2023 in the same way Nehe Milner-Skudder did for the All Blacks in 2015. They are both examples he has frequently used but it was telling to hear Jones reveal how quickly he was convinced of Arundell\u2019s potential, having watched Irish\u2019s draw with Wasps a few weeks ago in which he scored a dazzling try. Arundell is also eligible for Wales and Scotland but would be captured by England if he makes his full debut on the summer tour of Australia. \u201cHe has 12 months to find his feet. Remember Nehe Milner-Skudder? He came from nowhere in 2015 and that is the sort of thing a young guy can do,\u201d Jones said. \u201cThe reason I have compared Arundell [with Giteau] is a similar story. You get reports through on young players, and where there is smoke there is usually some fire. I remember getting a report on Giteau, what he could do, and then you go and watch him play. Within five minutes you can generally work out whether he\u2019s got it or not, whether he\u2019s got something special. \u201cI gave you that example of Arundell [against Wasps]. And Giteau was the same, I went to watch him play half-back for his club, and within five minutes you could tell he had something about him. \u201cThen the hard part comes, when they\u2019ve got to work really hard, they\u2019ve got to not believe what\u2019s being said about them, that they\u2019re not kid-wonder, that they\u2019ve got to apply themselves to the task and that\u2019s when the real player comes through. The test of a young player to become a good Test player is their ability to work hard, their ability to take knocks, their ability to keep resilient physically and mentally and to have that mindset to keep improving. \u201cFrom what I know of him, and I have met him once very briefly, he has got good attributes. But we will only see that on the three days of training we have.\u201d With 10 uncapped players in the squad it has been picked with an eye on the England v Barbarians match on 19 June \u2013 when Premiership finalists will be unavailable \u2013 and a number of senior players including Henry Slade, Ben Youngs and Joe Marler have been rested. Sam Simmonds is injured and his club, Exeter, expect him also to miss the trip to Australia as he requires surgery on his hip. Notable selections include the prop Mako Vunipola who, as reported by the Guardian, is back in Jones\u2019s thinking having been out of the picture all season.  Jones, meanwhile, conceded there is pressure to win in Australia with the forthcoming camp drawing a line under England\u2019s disappointing Six Nations performance. Jones took part in a formal review, conducted by the Rugby Football Union\u2019s anonymous panel, and though he insisted it was a productive process, there was a sense he has had more enjoyable experiences during his tenure. He is due to leave the role after next year\u2019s World Cup and all but confirmed reports he has been sounded out about joining Racing 92 in the French Top 14. \u201cThe support [from the RFU] has been first class, but my responsibility is to win,\u201d Jones said. \u201cIn this job there\u2019s always pressure, of course there\u2019s pressure to win in Australia. It\u2019s normal to be criticised, to be under fire a little bit. I don\u2019t think you ever get used to it, to losing. It\u2019s not a pleasant experience. But you take the positives out of the situation you have.\u201d Of the link with Racing, he told Sky Sports: \u201cObviously people ask you questions and if you reply it becomes a huge story. Maybe there has been a telephone conversation. Sometimes I don\u2019t handle those things, other people handle it for you. I\u2019m a rugby coach and I love coaching, and I still feel like I have plenty to contribute.\u201d"

                    "body": "Sale hit hard, hit often, and occasionally hit high. Their reward, having soaked up the self-inflicted damage caused by one red card and two yellows, is progress to the last eight of the Champions Cup. This last-16 second leg was as chaotic, eventful and entertaining as last week\u2019s first leg had been dire. Ultimately Sale\u2019s physicality, forward muscle and a late try by the captain, Jono Ross, was enough to deny Bristol a first visit to the quarter-finals.\nOn a night peppered with high tackles and TMO checks, not to mention a few tries, Sale had Arron Reed sent off in the first half, with Faf de Klerk and Nick Schonert also sent to the sin-bin either side of half-time, but the Sharks were the side still standing at the end of it all.\n\n\u201cYou can have all the tactics in the world but it does come down to effort and heart,\u201d said the Sale director of rugby, Alex Sanderson. \u201cJono asked the players on Thursday: if we\u2019re up, if we\u2019re down, just believe we can win this game. He drove that, they followed him and that\u2019s the result.\u201d\nAn opening flurry of kicking had suggested both teams would eliminate risk as far as possible but Sale\u2019s scrummaging power \u2013 combined with the prompting of De Klerk \u2013 began to punch holes in Bristol\u2019s defence. A smart 50-22 kick by the England No 9, Harry Randall, helped to arrest Sale\u2019s early momentum and Jake Kerr soon bundled over thanks to a pop pass by the Bears wing Luke Morahan.\nThe try was chalked off for a knock-on after a TMO review but, at the same time, De Klerk was sent to the sin bin for an early tackle on Fitz Harding.\nCallum Sheedy knocked over the penalty but when De Klerk emerged from the sin-bin 10 minutes later, it was Sale and their fearsome forwards in the ascendancy. Lood de Jager, another Sale Springbok, forced his way over for the first try.\n\nSale had taken a grip on the game but another card interrupted their progress. After Reed\u2019s reckless shoulder into the face of Bristol\u2019s Morahan, cutting in from the right, the referee, Frank Murphy, adjourned to a big screen. With every replay, the wails and jeers grew louder from Bristol fans and a red card duly appeared from Murphy\u2019s pocket.\nHowever, in view of the ease with which the visitors had managed De Klerk\u2019s yellow-card absence, there was reason to believe they would deal with a permanent one-man disadvantage. That was even more apparent when another beefy driving maul allowed Akker van der Merwe to peel off the side and dot down to make it 17-3 at half-time.\nWhen Bristol failed to gather the second-half restart, Manu Tuilagi and Jean-Luc du Preez combined to send Tom Roebuck over and give Sale a 20-point lead in the tie. Schonert\u2019s shoulder barge on Joe Joyce led to Sale\u2019s second yellow card and Harry Thacker, the replacement hooker, narrowed the gap with Bristol\u2019s first five-pointer.\n\nDown to 13, Sale understandably began to look ragged \u2013 with Semi Radradra and Charles Piutau appearing from the bench for Bristol. Morahan stole over on the right thanks to a brilliant pass by Randall and Bristol, for the first time, believed; even more so when Joyce barrelled over as the match moved into the final quarter. Du Preez\u2019s penalty edged Sale back in front, John Hawkins of Bristol was sent to the sin-bin for a high hit, and the home side\u2019s thrilling recovery ended when a cross-kick went right and Ross touched down. Morahan\u2019s second try, three minutes from time, was merely a consolation.\n\u201cIt\u2019s disappointment and it\u2019s frustration,\u201d said Pat Lam, Bristol\u2019s director of rugby. \u201cWe did all the hard work to get back and then we let it go at the end.

                    "body": "When England were pitted against Colombia at the 2018 World Cup, it was time for Steve Cooper to show Gareth Southgate his homework. Cooper, who had led England to the under-17 equivalent of the competition the previous year, was tasked by the Football Association with studying the South American side throughout the tournament and flew to Russia to present his findings to Southgate, the staff and the technical director, Dan Ashworth, in the buildup to the last-16 match in Moscow. \u201cDan always used to challenge the coaches: \u2018If you were the England manager, how would you set up? What would you do?\u2019\u201d says the England goalkeeping coach, Martyn Margetson, who later worked with Cooper at Swansea. \u201cThe tactical detail was incredible. He gave us a full insight into what Colombia were, really. You were looking at Steve and thinking: \u2018Yeah, you know your stuff.\u2019 It is a daunting task but Coops did an amazing job.\u201d England ended up winning on penalties.  Now Cooper\u2019s focus is on Nottingham Forest and facing Liverpool, where he spent five years coaching in the academy, in Sunday\u2019s FA Cup quarter-final. His work with England\u2019s under-17s, including with Phil Foden, Conor Gallagher and Jadon Sancho, enhanced an already blossoming reputation. Cooper arrived at the FA from Liverpool, where he became academy manager and coached Raheem Sterling and Trent Alexander-Arnold. Since taking charge at Forest in September, Djed Spence, 21, Brennan Johnson, 20, and James Garner, 21, have thrived. \u201cOver a long period, Steve will have worked with some of the best young players in the country,\u201d says Ian Foster, the England Under-19s head coach who, with Mike Marsh, assisted Cooper at the Under-17 World Cup. \u201cIn terms of his recruitment at Swansea, he had worked with [Marc] Gu\u00e9hi, Gallagher, [Rhian] Brewster [with England]. The players know him, they trust him, they like his ideas and they know what sort of coach and person he is. He knows how to handle young players. He\u2019s got tons of experience.\u201d  For Cooper, it all started at Wrexham when his manager, Brian Flynn, encouraged the full-back to pursue coaching and he became the club\u2019s head of youth development. In the early days he juggled taking the under-18s at Wrexham with playing part-time for Rhyl, Bangor and The New Saints. By the age of 27, he had his Uefa pro licence, the highest coaching qualification available. Liverpool liked what they saw and appointed Cooper as a youth coach. Frank McParland, then the academy director, promoted Cooper from under-16s to under-18s coach. Cooper worked closely with the technical manager at Liverpool\u2019s academy, Pep Segura, adopting the former Barcelona coach\u2019s philosophy. Cooper\u2019s passion radiated to his players. \u201cHe is the most dedicated manager I\u2019ve come across, in terms of his appetite, his eagerness, his energy, his buzz,\u201d says Jordan Lussey, who Cooper named under-18s captain at Liverpool. \u201cWe got to the FA Youth Cup semi-finals [in 2013] and played Chelsea over two legs. I\u2019d be out locally around Ormskirk on an evening and get a phone call off him saying: \u2018What do you think about this? I\u2019ve got this idea.\u2019 Or: \u2018Come into the office tomorrow, I need to show you something.\u2019 You would sit down, the two of us at a computer, and he would show you what he wants from you in a game, what their weaknesses are and that is another reason he has had great success. Any situation that was put in our way, you knew your job.\u201d  Cooper, born in Pontypridd, 12 miles north of Cardiff, is meticulous \u2013 on and off the grass. \u201cThere is not a stone that Steve leaves unturned,\u201d says Margetson. \u201cEven the smallest detail is important to him. He is across everything. The dressing room, how it is set up and how meeting rooms are set up, etcetera. One of the things he did around the training ground was make it feel more like Swansea City. He put images of the players all around the training ground and images of the supporters cheering on the team. He was proud to manage Swansea and he knew what it meant to the people. and he often referred to that in meetings and he did a lot of brilliant motivational [pre-match] videos for the players, showing them the history of the club.\u201d  The 42-year-old, whose father, Keith, was a referee, is an unassuming character and although a deep thinker and level-headed, he can be firm when required. \u201cIf he needs to give you the hairdryer treatment, he will,\u201d says Lussey, now with Curzon Ashton. \u201cIf he needs to give you praise, he will. That\u2019s where he gets that mutual respect from top to bottom. He\u2019s not your best mate where you can just mess about or not put in the work. He will pull you up properly and let you know what he thinks.\u201d Swansea\u2019s hierarchy were wowed by Cooper during his interview and, after guiding the club to successive play-off finishes on a modest budget, unsurprisingly there was Premier League interest last summer and he held talks with Crystal Palace. Forest identified Cooper as their first-choice target after sacking Chris Hughton when bottom of the Championship. They have risen to eighth, Wednesday\u2019s 3-1 home win over QPR continuing form that looks capable of securing a play-off place. Since his appointment six months ago they have lost only four times.  \u201cHe is very much a family man, but he lives and breathes football,\u201d Margetson says. \u201cIf he\u2019s not thinking about Forest, he\u2019ll be watching games somewhere. You can\u2019t just rock up and land in the Championship \u2013 you have to earn your stripes and study the game and there is no doubt that Coops has done.\u201d When Forest kick off against Liverpool at the City Ground, Foster will be watching on television at St George\u2019s Park, cup of tea in hand. \u201cI am immensely proud of him,\u201d Foster says. \u201cI think when you\u2019ve not had a wonderful playing career it\u2019s harder to establish yourself as a coach. He\u2019s had to do it the hard way and is reaping the rewards of that. He has been a shining light for coaches at the FA and beyond. He will play it down but I\u2019m sure he\u2019s itching to pit his wits against one of the best coaches in the game.\u201d"

                    "body": "Richard Wigglesworth batted away suggestions that his Leicester teammates must safeguard against complacency before their Champions Cup match against Clermont on Saturday. After a famous 29-10 win in France in the first leg last weekend, they are all but assured of a place in the last eight of Europe\u2019s premier competition. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be on any of the players\u2019 lips,\u201d Wigglesworth said of such premature talk. \u201cSteve [Borthwick] has created an environment where anyone wouldn\u2019t dare breathe, hopefully even think about it. We have to attack this weekend.\u201d  Wigglesworth, who also serves as an assistant coach, was glowing in his praise of Borthwick and explained how the former England captain has transformed the club into such a formidable outfit. Before Borthwick\u2019s arrival as head coach at the start of the 2020-1 campaign, Leicester were a team in decline. Two consecutive 11th-place finishes in the Premiership was an abject return for the 10-time champions. In his first season, Borthwick took the team to sixth in the league and also reached the Challenge Cup final, losing by a point against Montpellier at Twickenham. This year, few would be surprised if they secured a domestic and continental double. \u201cHe is as on-task as anyone I\u2019ve met,\u201d Wigglesworth said of Borthwick\u2019s approach. \u201cThere is a non-stop need for the next minute, hour, day, week to be really good. He\u2019s doing what he should be doing, which is leading. That is where he is most comfortable, that is where he excels. He\u2019s really skilled but still authentic. He\u2019s just really skilled but still authentic. Really skilled with his language, with his demeanour, the tone of his voice, the list goes on.\u201d  Beyond Borthwick\u2019s philosophy, Wigglesworth has his own experience to serve as a ballast to any complacency. He was part of the last English team to win in Clermont with Sale in 2008 but was on the losing side in the next round at home against Munster. \u201cWe thought we were better than we were,\u201d Wigglesworth said of that defeat 14 years ago. \u201c[Leicester] haven\u2019t done anything yet.\u201d Perhaps not, but Wigglesworth has, particularly with Saracens, where he won nine major trophies including three European Cups. Is this Leicester team on its way to replicating those Saracens feats? \u201cLike a disciple of Borthwick, Wigglesworth played down the comparison. \u201cThis is a team that\u2019s won zero [trophies] and was the worst team in the league 18 months ago. I\u2019d be pretty bonkers to think those two teams are comparable at the moment.."

                    "body": "Scientists can\u2019t quite agree on how long it will be until the universe ends. The most trigger-happy astrophysicists have it at around 22bn years, but if we\u2019re lucky it could keep chugging away for 200bn. Earth has slightly less time \u2013 becoming a burnt-out lifeless rock in about 5bn, after the sun runs out of fuel and enters what\u2019s known as its \u201cred giant phase\u201d. Which brings us to Manchester United \u2013 who appeared to run out of fuel in 2013. As a gaunt, expressionless Erik ten Hag stood in his technical area at Old Trafford on Sunday, it was hard not to feel that this Groundhog Day paint-by-numbers crisis might be put out of its misery only by the demise of the entire planet.  Within seconds of the full-time whistle the memes began. Complete this sentence: The biggest problem at Manchester United is \u2026 Where do you start? Should we create a Microsoft Word template just below \u201ccreate your own CV\u201d with a simple go-to list that you save as a PDF or print out and keep? A simple, effective service that you can refer to every time there\u2019s an issue at the Theatre of Dreams. The first thing to mention is DNA. Divide everyone into those who \u201creally understand\u201d the DNA of the club, and those that don\u2019t \u2013 including some blithe mentions of attacking football, of taking the game to the opposition and of turning Old Trafford into a \u201cfortress\u201d.  At which point the camera must pan to Sir Alex Ferguson in the stands. You can imagine United conceding an early goal at home to Sturm Graz in the opening game of the European Super League Division 2 in the year 2047. The 50-year-old Scott McTominay, parachuted in as head coach after a mid-table Championship finish in charge of Reading, shakes his head. The TV director calls for a closeup of the 105-year-old Sir Alex. He looks on glumly. It took 17 minutes for the camera to land on Fergie\u2019s face during the Brighton game. Feels like that\u2019s the longest it\u2019s ever taken. Progress perhaps.   It is almost becoming acceptable to question the benefits of the great man\u2019s continued presence \u2013 is a \u201cthinktank\u201d with David Gill and Bryan Robson the answer? Football might be 90% nostalgia. But nostalgia is meant to be nostalgic, not current. But what to do? He is simply too important to \u201cwork the lounges\u201d. What must be stressed in our handy United crisis guide is how Sir Alex would routinely change his backroom staff \u2013 a key to his success; no one has done it since \u2013 without referencing the fact none of his successors have been there long enough to rotate their wide men, let alone their first-team coach. We need a chapter on the players. It is well documented that you don\u2019t just become a bad player overnight. But there must be a minimum number of nights required for it to be possible \u2013 and it\u2019s something the club have perfected.  The almost pantomine attacks on Harry Maguire earnestly galumphing around like a Gorg from Fraggle Rock might be unfair. But seeing him back away from the Brighton strikeforce makes you wonder how Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 might fare in Qatar. Jadon Sancho is fast becoming the man with the sword from Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark \u2013 swirling it around and around until Harrison Ford just shoots him. At Borussia Dortmund Sancho stepovered and jinked past people at will. Now he does it in front of them before passing it back to Diogo Dalot. Lisandro Mart\u00ednez is too short (please ignore Cannavaro &amp; Mascherano) to be a centre-back. What HAS HAPPENED to Marcus Rashford? McFred. You could pick so many. Callers are lined up to complain (correctly) about the Glaziers (sic) \u2013 sucking money, joy, entertainment out of the club. Important here to mention noodle partners, rubber affiliates, biofuel official suppliers, all complemented by an NFT of Ed Woodward\u2019s face. Football fans can be forgiven for switching off when people start talking about leveraged debt. None of us got into this game to hear about that. Neither do we want to hear about net spend. But United\u2019s is enormous and yet for what? Where is the plan? Months of hoping for want-to-stay-at-home midfielder Frenkie de Jong only to be seemingly usurped by Chelsea, while each refreshed gossip page underwhelms in turn. Arnautovic. Rabiot. Morata. Odion Ighalo wasn\u2019t the exception. He was the blueprint.  And of course there\u2019s Cristiano Ronaldo \u2013 who should really be higher up this box-ticking exercise. Most pressing would be for one of the more tactically minded columnists to work out if pressing is still part of his game, if it ever was. It\u2019s surprising that no one has really mentioned it. He scored all the goals. But is he the problem? Someone will get around to covering that eventually. In all of this, you have to at least acknowledge how this all affects the fans \u2013 who the club at least pretend matter in this whole affair. Being a football fan is about expectations. Years of being the best must make this agony. Just because it\u2019s hard to sympathise with the fanbase of a team that dominated for almost your entire youth doesn\u2019t mean you shouldn\u2019t. Manchester United fans are people too. However for the rest of us this is the gift that keeps on giving. Just before you save this to the desktop for easy access, point out that things can change quickly. It would be wonderful to see players bereft of confidence find it again. It would be good for the league if there was another team competing. What Ten Hag needs is time. Otherwise we rinse and repeat for 5bn years."

My girlfriend and I recently moved and No 1 on our list of priorities (before unpacking or sussing out the emergency exits) was to find our new Local Cafe. Similarly to experts who say \u201cit\u2019s important to buy a good mattress because you spend a third of your life in bed\u201d, I say \u201cit\u2019s important to find which barista you can make small talk with for 15 minutes every day until your sublet ends, because you\u2019ll be talking to them more than to your own mother\u201d. Perhaps not as universal, but equally true. So we set out, ready to put in the hard yards. Over the course of a few weeks, we sampled each of the numerous cafes within a distance from our front door that we\u2019d realistically be willing to walk each day, regardless of our state.  After lots of coffee and food, and some trial and error (including accidentally paying $14.50 for an average ham and cheese croissant that I will NEVER get over), we decided on The One. This cafe has everything: it could only be closer if we paid the baristas to work from our own kitchen, the coffee tastes like heaven, and the people that work there are nice and make us feel welcome. We\u2019d done it! It was perfect. Except for one tiny thing. If you become a regular at a cafe, the people that work there will generally try to learn your name: it\u2019s good business practice, and it\u2019s also nice. They do this by asking your name for the order and then remembering it. My girlfriend managed this simple process without a hitch, communicating her name, which they then took on board. For me, it was slightly more difficult. A couple of visits in, I heard one of the baristas say my name. It sounded a bit different to \u201cRebecca\u201d, but I couldn\u2019t quite hear him, so I just let it go. A few more visits in, it became abundantly clear that everyone at the cafe had learned my name as \u201cRachel\u201d. This is a very easy mistake to make when dealing with two of the world\u2019s most boring white woman names, but it left me at a crossroads. Other people disagreed with the \u201ccrossroads\u201d part, seeing one very clear road: tell the extremely nice people at the cafe that there\u2019d been a name mixup. To them, it was simple, but I couldn\u2019t bring myself to do it. It had been too long, the embarrassment I would feel too large, the fear that I would make them feel embarrassed also weighing heavily.  I decided I would just be Rachel at this cafe for a few months. It wouldn\u2019t be a big deal, how much could my name possibly come up? After some reflection, I can admit now that I underestimated how much my name could come up. I forgot that in order to remember so many customer\u2019s names, the names must be repeated at every opportunity. I am greeted and farewelled and chatted to (lovely), all with the name \u201cRachel\u201d dangerously zipping about in the air. My loved ones, at first resistant to my deranged conflict avoidance, were eventually, inevitably dragged into the fray. One morning, when I spilled the coffee I had just brought home, my girlfriend went back down to get more. She tried to keep my name out of the small talk by saying \u201cwe had a spill.\u201d Unfortunately, the barista immediately asked \u201cwho spilled it?\u201d and she faced her own crossroads, eventually quietly answering \u201cRachel\u201d. When we both got Covid and were stuck inside for weeks, our friend did a cafe visit for us, and confirmed to them he was buying coffee for \u201cRachel\u201d. Like I\u2019m in some sort of witness protection program, I text people I\u2019m meeting for coffee that they have to call me Rachel. If I run into friends randomly at the cafe, I\u2019m required to quickly sidle up to them and murmur \u201cplease call me Rachel\u201d. I began to have a few small regrets. Then, my new name started making it onto the coffee itself.  Rach! I was now getting nicknames on my fake name! Still, I refused to say anything. I was in too deep, and besides \u2013 there\u2019s only so many new situations that can happen at a cafe. We must have reached Maximum Rachel. Or so I thought. Meeting a friend for breakfast, we decided to eat in at the cafe for the first time. I did the usual text warning to my friend, and she arrived with a wave and a happy \u201cGood Morning Rachel!\u201d. I ordered my coffee, and when it was placed in front of me, this is what we saw:  I can\u2019t quite find the words to explain the emotions that ran through me at this moment. From the outside, I can only imagine how bizarre our reaction to this beautiful coffee art looked. We fell silent instantly, our mouths hanging open, a physiological reaction to the funniest thing in the world happening, with no right to laugh. Then, almost in unison, we all realised how strangely we were acting and burst out with \u201coh my god so cute\u201d and \u201cwow the talent!\u201d all at once. It has been a breathtaking, and obvious, lesson. By trying to avoid a minor situation where both parties would have felt a tiny piece of embarrassment, I have now gotten myself into a complicated situation where I have to worry about a much bigger embarrassing moment: if it comes out I\u2019ve been Rebecca this entire time. I am humbled by the terrible and confusing decisions I have made in the near past, and I will never end up in this position again. Even though this experience has taught me a lesson, I am sorry to tell you all that I absolutely will not be applying what I have learned to this current ongoing situation. Unless the absolute angels at the cafe read this article and discover my secret (if you\u2019re reading this, I love you, your coffee is the best, I\u2019m so sorry), inside those four cafe walls \u2013 I\u2019m Rachel. \u2022 Rebecca Shaw is a writer based in Sydney"

                    "body": "A 200-year-old English pottery has seen its brand enhanced in South Korea thanks to the lockdown hit Squid Game. Denby Pottery, named after the Derbyshire village where it was set up by Joseph Bourne in 1809, has been steadily increasing its business in Asia. It is now on sale with a reported \u00a350m valuation, and seeking new investors to expand ever further.  Founded on a rich seam of clay during the building of a main road serving mills between Alfreton and Derby, the brand is now ploughing a rich new seam of customers, particularly in China and India. Since Denby\u2019s Halo cup featured in an episode of the Netflix show, the firm\u2019s popularity has increased further in South Korea, where it has a store in Gangnam, a district of Seoul made famous in the 2012 pop song Gangnam Style. Back in the 1970s, Denby had three bowls in its range. Today it has 40, with items including nesting pots, straight-sided rice and deep ramen noodle bowls, small round dishes as well as soju cups in which to serve Korean alcohol. In 2009 the company was rescued from administration by the investment firm Hilco Capital, a turnaround specialist that has helped companies including Homebase, Habitat and HMV. Hilco has appointed finnCap to advise on the sale. Sebastian Lazell, the Denby chief executive, told the Times: \u201cThere are 55 million people in South Korea and they love the premium casual look of our glazes because formal ornate ware is out of fashion. They lay the table very differently in Korea so almost 40% of our production over there is bowls.\u201d Vikki Irvine, a senior brand manager at the pottery, added: \u201cOur collections are popular with younger generations in Korea. It\u2019s also a move away from the traditional tableware their parents owned, as we see a shift in the Korean culture for the younger generation to have their own identity.\u201d  Lazell said Hilco was delighted at the sustained progress of its investment and was keen to ensure that the positive trajectory continues. \u201cDenby Pottery, our investors and advisers are, therefore, reviewing options for the future ownership of the Denby Group, potentially involving the support of investors better suited to the increasingly international needs of the business in the years ahead.\u201d He added: \u201cNo decisions have been taken at this time and any potential future decision will be taken with the interests of the company\u2019s stakeholders always in mind.\u201d"

                    "body": "Kevin Sinfield left an indelible mark on English rugby league during his career as a player, but if Leeds Rhinos lift the women\u2019s Challenge Cup on Saturday and England follow suit in the Rugby League World Cup this autumn, a conversation Sinfield held three years ago will have undoubtedly played a part. It was late-2019 when Courtney Winfield-Hill considered ending her stint as one of the pioneering stars of the Women\u2019s Super League and potentially returning to the sport where she initially made her name back home in Australia. A former star of the Big Bash League, Winfield-Hill wondered if it was the right time to pursue a cricketing career once again. \u201cThe financial rewards were a lot higher, getting a contract to play cricket in England, but what Kevin said kept gnawing away at me,\u201d Winfield-Hill explains.  Sinfield, then working for the Rhinos in an off-field role, politely reminded her that if she continued playing league for long enough, she would ultimately qualify for England under the sport\u2019s five-year residency rule. \u201cKevin had spent a lot of time with me, working on my game and he wanted to know what was next,\u201d she reveals. \u201cI was set on going to have a try at get a contract in cricket for sure at that stage, but he planted the England seed, and it made me think.\u201d Fast forward to the present day, and plenty has changed. Winfield-Hill has married her long-term partner, the England cricket international, Lauren Winfield-Hill, and the postponement of the World Cup to this autumn has opened the door for the Leeds Rhinos star to potentially represent England in the tournament after she officially qualified in February. She was almost immediately named in Craig Richards\u2019 train-on squad.  That is no surprise, given Winfield-Hill\u2019s undeniable talent. Before all of that though, there is the prospect of the Rhinos trying to reclaim the Women\u2019s Challenge Cup in front of a home crowd on Saturday at Elland Road when they take on St Helens. The game forms part of a triple-header with the two men\u2019s Challenge Cup semi-finals and after spending most of the last two years on hiatus due to Covid-19, Winfield-Hill is in no doubt about the importance of Saturday\u2019s game for both Leeds and the wider women\u2019s game. \u201cWe had some terrific momentum building into 2020, some great media exposure and it was incredibly disheartening to just see the 2020 season completely cancelled,\u201d she admits. \u201cWith this being a triple-header, I hope there\u2019s a lot of rugby league fans that haven\u2019t been to a women\u2019s game before and we can put on a show for them.\u201d The game will be televised live on the BBC, another significant step for the growth of the women\u2019s game following the advent of the Women\u2019s Super League in 2018. \u201cIt\u2019s great the BBC are providing free-to-air coverage and a real platform,\u201d she says. \u201cThe continued growth of the women\u2019s game relies upon it, and it\u2019s the starting point for a big year with a World Cup looming. Winning it in Leeds, for Leeds, would be one of the most special moments of my career.\u201d  But just like the rest of the rugby league public, Winfield-Hill finds it difficult to not have at least one eye on this year\u2019s World Cup. \u201cIf someone had told me five years ago I\u2019d be potentially playing for England against Australia, I\u2019d have questioned their sanity,\u201d the 35-year-old laughs. \u201cBut I\u2019m all-in for England no matter what. The way the rugby league community has embraced me here meant it was an easy opportunity to say yes to and stay in rugby league.\u201d Leeds\u2019 chances of success on Saturday, and indeed England\u2019s later this year, are much better with Winfield-Hill still in the sport. She has been one of the standout players in the women\u2019s game despite not playing since junior level prior to moving to England with Lauren in 2018. \u201cAustralia will always be home in some ways but right now, Leeds is home and England is home,\u201d she says. How would she fare with the prospect of an England versus Australia World Cup final, though? \u201cI\u2019d absolutely love it,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019d obviously be quietly hoping England won; well, not quietly, very loudly, as I\u2019d hopefully be playing! I\u2019m committed to delivering for England and Leeds for as long as possible. When Kevin spoke to me three years ago I wasn\u2019t sure where my future was heading in rugby league but staying here, being part of something historic for club and now maybe country too, I think I\u2019ve made the right decision.\u201d"

                    "body": "Let us be honest, the Champions Cup tie between Leicester and Clermont is in effect over. The Premiership leaders produced one of the more remarkable away performances in European rugby last week, thrashing the Top 14 side 29-10, scoring five tries to one and maintaining their supremacy despite playing with 14 men for the final 20 minutes. Based on those events in the Auvergne, something spectacular and calamitous in equal measure would need to transpire at Welford Road on Saturday to prevent Leicester\u2019s march into the next round. That is exactly what Clermont are banking on.  \u201cWe believe we can do it. Why not?\u201d asks JJ Hanrahan, Clermont\u2019s Irish utility back. \u201cWe know no one outside the group gives us a chance. But you know what, that\u2019s liberating in a way. We just want to go out there and give it our all. We owe it to the fans to give a better account of ourselves.\u201d Their \u201cbelow average\u201d display, as Hanrahan describes it, stunned their usually boisterous home support at the Stade Marcel-Michelin. \u201cBefore the last 10 minutes, it was the best atmosphere I\u2019ve seen since we beat Toulouse,\u201d Hanrahan says, referencing a 16-13 win on New Year\u2019s Day. \u201cBut that last 10 was chilling. You could see it hurt them. That\u2019s affected us. We take ownership of that.\u201d Leicester\u2019s triumph was the first time a Premiership team had beaten Clermont on their own patch since Sale\u2019s 32-15 win in 2008. It was achieved through simple rugby perfectly executed. A well-drilled lineout, a brutally efficient driving maul, well-worked clearing kicks and an insatiable hunger around the breakdown strangled the home side into submission. \u201cThey\u2019re so clinical,\u201d Hanrahan says. \u201cThey\u2019re clearly coached very well. They\u2019re so hard to play against. Even if we wanted to be more attacking, play more rugby, we couldn\u2019t. We were not at our best but they put so much pressure on us. That\u2019s not making excuses. We have to be better.\u201d  Hanrahan would not divulge trade secrets but intimated that they will look to close down Leicester\u2019s relieving kickers and force their heavy forwards into a more open game. \u201cThat\u2019s easier said than done,\u201d Hanrahan admits, not least because of the man pulling the strings for the Tigers. George Ford is leaving for Sale at the end of the season but if this Leicester squad manage to win a trophy this year and if they go on to become a dynastic force under Steve Borthwick, they will for ever be imprinted by Ford\u2019s legacy. Not that he is outwardly reflecting on that at this moment. \u201cWe\u2019re fully focused on the now,\u201d he says, parroting Borthwick\u2019s strict doctrine. \u201cWe are energised for this week. Steve is very explicit in what he says. We don\u2019t look any further than what the challenge is ahead of us, that will always remain the same under Steve, that is the way good teams go about their business.\u201d  Before Borthwick\u2019s arrival in 2020, Leicester were an empire in ruin. The most successful club in the country, with 10 league titles, had finished 11th for two consecutive seasons. In his first year, Borthwick took them to sixth as well as to the Challenge Cup final. Now they are pushing for a rare continental and domestic double. What has changed? \u201cA lot of hard work, there is no secret formula, I wish I could tell you there was,\u201d Ford says. \u201cIt is doing the basics brilliantly well, working hard day in, day out, week in, week out. I wish I could tell you it is something else but it is not.\u201d Ford, who has built a career on his consistency, defended those who prefer substance over style: \u201cI think what\u2019s gone out of the game, and is now a bit unfashionable, is if you do your job as a team of individuals unbelievably well and you dominate the game, it\u2019s not exciting enough for people sometimes.  \u201cWe want to play the most efficient way. We want to build pressure, score points and stop the opposition from scoring points. For this group of players, we believe this way is the best way.\u201d Expect few alterations, then, from Leicester as they look to reach the last eight of Europe\u2019s premier club competition for the first time since 2014. If Clermont and Hanrahan have any designs on a bewildering upset, they will need a dramatic change from last week."

                    "body": "There have been some see-sawing contests in Europe over the years but few that have lurched so markedly from one extreme to the other. Munster were staring into the abyss for long periods of this madcap tie but by the end it was Exeter, reduced to 13 men for a chunk of the final quarter, who were left slightly anxious about what next weekend may bring. In the final analysis Exeter were indebted to a remarkable 45-metre drop goal from Stuart Hogg which may yet offer some kind of lifeline in Limerick on Easter Saturday. Munster, though, will be massively buoyed by their spirit in adversity, a 66th-minute try by winger Shane Daly having left this two-leg encounter beautifully poised at the halfway stage.  Even in the good old days Munster have rarely had to overcome such a lengthy injury list or more off-field discontent but some things never change. The visitors were nothing if not cussed and might even have won had Exeter, with Olly Woodburn and Patrick Schickerling in the sin-bin, not kept their line intact throughout a 13-phase Munster assault. Fair play to Munster\u2019s Keith Earls, too, whose tackle on Woodburn prevented an almost certain late score that may yet prove significant. Exeter, by now, were back to 15 men and on the charge again, desperate to add another score and take a bigger cushion to Ireland. It did not materialise and if they fail to advance to the quarter-finals they will kick themselves for not taking more advantage of all their first-half territory and possession. Munster, by contrast, will regard this as a moral victory in some respects, given their large number of absentees. With Peter O\u2019Mahony, Andrew Conway, Joey Carbery, Tadhg Beirne, Dave Kilcoyne and Gavin Coombes already missing, it was almost cruel when a stomach bug ruled out Simon Zebo and reserve hooker Diarmuid Barron on the eve of the game.  It was no surprise, then, that Munster were soon right up against it physically, with Exeter putting a sparkling try on the board inside six minutes. A quick tap penalty was whisked right to Tom O\u2019Flaherty who made a typically sharp break and a flying Hogg duly finished off an impressively slick attack. Aside from the breakdown where John Hodnett enjoyed some success the Exeter pack had an edge at the scrums and the home side duly dominated possession and territory. They came close to a couple more tries when first Jack Yeandle and then Dave Ewers were denied when a rumbling score looked highly likely.  Could Munster somehow fashion something improbable? Grit automatically comes with the jersey but, for long periods, there was no escaping the inexorable pressure. By the time Jacques Vermeulen finally drove over for Exeter\u2019s long overdue second try two minutes before half-time the visitors had also lost replacement Jack O\u2019Sullivan to the sin-bin after the promising young No 8 Alex Kendellen had failed a head injury assessment. Both conversions floated wide on the breeze, though, which meant Exeter led by only 10-0 at the interval. The home and away format suited them perfectly back in 2010 when they were seeking to clinch promotion at Bristol\u2019s expense from the Championship but Thomond Park is rarely the best place to go for a stress-free second leg. Hence the renewed sense of Exeter purpose in the third quarter when, initially, they again did pretty much everything except score. It has been a recurring theme this season and as the stolen lineouts, penalties and turnovers began to mount up, so did Munster\u2019s morale. A simple penalty from stand-off Ben Healy narrowed the deficit to seven points and, for the first time, the Fields of Athenry could be heard in Devon.  Worse was to follow for Exeter when first Woodburn and then Schickerling were sent to the bin inside three minutes for a rogue forearm and playing the ball on the ground respectively. Could the 13 men hold on? With the help of Hogg\u2019s majestic hoof, they just about scrambled over the line but they will need to be sharper in their opponents\u2019 22 in the rematch. Rob Baxter was also unhappy with both yellow cards but insists his team are still in control of their own destiny. \u201cI\u2019m actually pretty comfortable with where we are,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve just got to go for it next week.\u201d"

Their huge investments in new fossil fuel production could pay off only if countries fail to rapidly slash carbon emissions, which scientists say is vital. \nThe oil and gas industry is extremely volatile but extraordinarily profitable, particularly when prices are high, as they are at present. ExxonMobil, Shell, BP and Chevron have made almost $2tn in profits in the past three decades, while recent price rises led BP\u2019s boss to describe the company as a \u201ccash machine\u201d.\nThe lure of colossal payouts in the years to come appears to be irresistible to the oil companies, despite the world\u2019s climate scientists stating in February that further delay in cutting fossil fuel use would mean missing our last chance \u201cto secure a liveable and sustainable future for all\u201d. As the UN secretary general, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, warned world leaders in April: \u201cOur addiction to fossil fuels is killing us.\u201d\nDetails of the projects being planned are not easily accessible but an investigation published in the Guardian shows:\n\nThe fossil fuel industry\u2019s short-term expansion plans involve the start of oil and gas projects that will produce greenhouse gases equivalent to a decade of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from China, the world\u2019s biggest polluter.\nThese plans include 195 carbon bombs, gigantic oil and gas projects that would each result in at least a billion tonnes of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions over their lifetimes, in total equivalent to about 18 years of current global CO<sub>2 </sub>emissions. About 60% of these have already started pumping.\nThe dozen biggest oil companies are on track to spend $103m a day for the rest of the decade exploiting new fields of oil and gas that cannot be burned if global heating is to be limited to well under 2C.\nThe Middle East and Russia often attract the most attention in relation to future oil and gas production but the US, Canada and Australia are among the countries with the biggest expansion plans and the highest number of carbon bombs. The US, Canada and Australia also give some of the world\u2019s biggest subsidies for fossil fuels per capita.\n\n\nThe dozen biggest oil companies are on track to spend every day for the rest of the decade$103m\n\nAt the UN\u2019s Cop26 climate summit in November, after a quarter-century of annual negotiations that as yet have failed to deliver a fall in global emissions, countries around the world finally included the word \u201ccoal\u201d in their concluding decision.\nEven this belated mention of the dirtiest fossil fuel was fraught, leaving a \u201cdeeply sorry\u201d Cop president, Alok Sharma, fighting back tears on the podium after India announced a last-minute softening of the need to \u201cphase out coal\u201d to \u201cphase down coal\u201d.\nNonetheless, the world agreed coal power was history \u2013 the question now was how quickly cheaper renewables could replace it, and how fair the transition would be for the small number of developing countries that still relied on it.\nBut there was no mention of oil and gas in the Cop26 final deal, despite these being responsible for almost 60% of fossil fuel emissions.\nFurthermore, many of the rich countries, such as the US, that dominate international climate diplomacy and positioned themselves as climate leaders at the conference, are big players in new oil and gas projects. But unlike India, they avoided criticism.\nThat lack of scrutiny prompted the Guardian to spend the months since Cop26 piecing together the clearest picture possible of forthcoming oil and gas exploration and production. \nCode red\nThe world\u2019s scientists agree the planet is in deep trouble. In August, Guterres reacted strongly to a stark report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the world\u2019s leading authority on climate science. \u201c[This report] is a code red for humanity,\u201d he said.\n The IPCC states carbon emissions must fall by half by 2030 to preserve the chance of a liveable future, yet they show no sign of declining.\nExperts have been warning since at least 2011 that most of the world\u2019s fossil fuel reserves could not be burned without causing catastrophic global heating.\nIn 2015, a high-profile analysis found that to limit global temperature below 2C, half of known oil reserves and a third of gas had to stay in the ground, along with 80% of coal.\n\n\u201cSimply put, they are lying and the results will be catastrophic,\u201d said Guterres. \u201cInvesting in new fossil fuels infrastructure is moral and economic madness.\u201d\n\nToday, the problem is even more acute. A better understanding of the devastating impacts of the climate crisis has led to the internationally agreed limit for global heating being lowered to 1.5C, to cut the risks of extreme heatwaves, droughts, and floods.\nIn May 2021, a report from the International Energy Agency, previously seen as a conservative body, concluded there could be no new oil or gas fields or coalmines if the world was to reach net zero by 2050.\nMore warnings soon followed. An updated scientific analysis found the proportion of fossil fuel reserves that would need to stay in the ground for 1.5C jumped to 60% for oil and gas and 90% for coal, while the UN warned that planned fossil fuel production \u201cvastly exceeds\u201d the limit needed for 1.5C.\nIn April, shocked by the latest IPCC report that said it was \u201cnow or never\u201d to start slashing emissions, Guterres launched an outspoken attack on companies and governments whose climate actions did not match their words.\n\u201cSimply put, they are lying, and the results will be catastrophic,\u201d he said. \u201cInvesting in new fossil fuels infrastructure is moral and economic madness.\n\u201cClimate activists are sometimes depicted as dangerous radicals. But the truly dangerous radicals are the countries that are increasing the production of fossil fuels.\u201d\nThe reaction to Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine has pushed oil and gas prices even higher, further incentivising bets on new fields and infrastructure that would last decades. \nThe failure of countries to \u201cbuild back greener\u201d after the Covid-19 pandemic or the 2008 financial crash was not a good omen, and Guterres said: \u201cFossil fuel interests are now cynically using the war in Ukraine to lock in a high-carbon future.\u201d\n\nAssessing future oil and gas developments is challenging: the sector is complex and often secretive, public information is scarce and hard to find and assess. But a global team of Guardian environment reporters has worked with leading thinktanks, analysts and academics across the world over the past five months and now we can answer a series of questions that reveal the scale of the sector\u2019s plans.\nFirst, how much production is due to come from the projects that are likely to start drilling before the end of this crucial decade?\nNext, where exactly are the biggest projects around the world, the so-called carbon bombs that would explode the climate?\nWe also followed the money: how much is going to be spent on oil and gas that cannot be burned safely, rather than invested in clean energy? And who benefits most from the fossil fuel subsidies that hide the true damage they cause?\nThe answers to these key questions lead to an inescapable conclusion: if the projects go ahead, they will blow the world\u2019s rapidly shrinking cap on emissions that must be kept to enable a liveable future \u2013 known as the carbon budget.\nFor all the promises made by many oil companies, the data shows they remain committed to their core business despite the consequences.\n\nPlans to expand\nThe short-term expansion plans of oil and gas companies, such as ExxonMobil and Gazprom, are colossal. The Guardian\u2019s investigation has found that in the next seven or so years, they are likely to start producing oil and gas from projects that would ultimately deliver 192bn barrels, the equivalent of a decade of today\u2019s emissions from China.\nThis estimate was provided by analysts at Urgewald, who used data from Rystad Energy, the industry standard source but not publicly available.\nTheir Gogel database includes 887 companies that explore for and produce oil and gas, and covers 97% of short-term expansion plans.\nThe companies have made a final financial commitment to projects that will deliver 116bn barrels, more than half of the 192bn barrel total.\nThey have also invested heavily in the rest, including final development, engineering and operation plans. Such investment makes these projects likely to go ahead, barring drastic government action, Urgewald says.\n\nCompanies have already made their final financial commitment to projects that will deliver 116bn barrels of oil116bn\n\nA third of the short-term expansion plans of oil and gas would come from \u201cunconventional\u201d and riskier sources. These include fracking and ultra-deep offshore drilling, which are inherently more dangerous \u2013 as the oil and gas companies drill deeper, the number of spills, injuries and blowouts increase. \nThe 192bn barrels are split roughly 50:50 between liquids, including crude oil, and gas. Burning this would produce 73bn tonnes of CO<sub>2</sub>. But methane routinely leaks from gas operations and is a powerful greenhouse gas, trapping 86 times more heat than CO<sub>2</sub> over 20 years. Including this impact, at a standard supply-chain leak rate of 2.3%, means the equivalent of 97bn tonnes of CO<sub>2</sub> added to the atmosphere and driving us faster towards climate hell.\n\nState oil companies lead the Urgewald short-term expansion list, with Qatar Energy, Russia\u2019s Gazprom and Saudi Aramco the top three. Half of Gazprom\u2019s projected expansion is in the fragile Arctic, though the long-term implications of Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine on its fossil fuel plans remain to be seen.\nThe listed oil majors ExxonMobil, Total, Chevron, Shell and BP are all in the top 10. Unconventional and risky oil and gas production accounts for about 70% of the US majors\u2019 totals, while the proportion of fracking and ultra-deep water ranges from 30% to 60% for the European companies.\n\u201cMost oil and gas companies are just proceeding with business as usual,\u201d Nils Bartsch at Urgewald said. \u201cSome just do not care. Some do not see their responsibility because governments around the world let them proceed, although of course these governments are often influenced by the industry.\u201d\nTwo-thirds of the 116bn barrels of oil and gas projects companies are financially committed to are in the Middle East, Russia and North America, according to data provided by Rystad Energy.\n\nAustralia is anticipated to be a big contributor with 3.4bn barrels, more than from the whole of Europe, where fields are relatively depleted.\nA separate analysis for the Guardian by Urgewald on the average annual investment in oil and gas exploration over the past three years shows that, along with Shell, three large but rarely scrutinised Chinese companies occupy the top four slots: PetroChina, China National Offshore Oil Corporation, and Sinopec. Seven of the top 10 of these explorers are relying on fracking, ultra-deep water Arctic and tar sands developments for more than half of their expansion.\nCarbon bombs\nDaniel Ribeiro has been fighting plans for a massive offshore pipeline and liquefied natural gas plant in Cabo Delgado province, Mozambique, since it was mooted more than 15 years ago.\nThe scheme, which would lead to a huge increase in carbon emissions in one of the poorest and most climate-vulnerable countries, is backed by more than \u00a31bn from the UK government and has some of the biggest oil and gas corporations circling, scenting another huge payday.\n\nResearch shared exclusively with the Guardian has identified the development in Cabo Delgado will drive catastrophic climate breakdown around the world\n\n\u201cIt is already creating a massive amount of disruption for the local fishing and subsistence farmers who are being moved off their land,\u201d said Ribeiro, from the local Justi\u00e7a Ambiental campaign group. \u201cBut if it goes ahead and countries like Mozambique are set off on a fossil fuel track, it will be a global disaster. We can forget tackling the climate crisis \u2026 we will all suffer.\u201d\nResearch shared exclusively with the Guardian has identified the Cabo Delgado development as one of 195 carbon bombs, which \u2013 unless stopped \u2013 will drive catastrophic climate breakdown around the world.\nThe term carbon bomb has been widely used in climate circles for the past decade to describe large fossil fuel projects or other big sources of carbon. The new research sets a specific definition: projects capable of pumping at least 1bn tonnes of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions over their lifetimes.\nProjects identified include the new drilling wells springing up in the Canadian wilderness as part of the vast Montney Play oil and gas development, and the huge North Field gas fields in Qatar \u2013 named in the study as the biggest new oil and gas carbon bomb in the world.\nThe study, led by Kjell K\u00fchne from the University of Leeds in the UK and published in the journal Energy Policy, found that just a few months after many of the world\u2019s politicians positioned themselves as climate leaders during the Cop26 conference in Glasgow, they were giving the green light to a massive global expansion of oil and gas production that scientists warn would push civilisation to the brink.\nAsad Rehman, a leading climate justice activist in the UK who was at the forefront of a global network of indigenous activists and civil society campaigners in Glasgow, accused the US, Canada and Australia of \u201crank hypocrisy\u201d.\n\u201cThese countries are single-handedly undermining efforts to curtail global emissions and ignoring their responsibility to phase out fossil fuels rapidly and justly.\u201d He said it was the poorest and most vulnerable who were suffering.\n\n\nTogether these projects would produce 646 GtCO<sub>2 </sub>emissions, swallowing up the world\u2019s entire carbon budget646Gt\n\n\u201cOnly the colonial mindset of political leaders in rich countries can make the brutal calculation that the interest of fossil fuel giants and their billions in profit is more important than the lives of people who are overwhelmingly black, brown and poor.\u201d\nTogether these projects would produce 646bn tonnes of CO<sub>2 </sub>emissions, the study says, swallowing the world\u2019s entire carbon budget. More than 60% of these schemes are already operating.\nK\u00fchne, the director of the Leave it in the Ground Initiative, said in the first instance, the 40% of projects that had not yet started production must be stopped if the world was to avoid sliding ever more quickly towards catastrophe, adding they should be a prominent focus of the global climate protest movement in the months and years ahead.\n\u201cThe oil and gas industry is continuing to plan these huge projects, even in the face of a burning planet. The ambitious targets of the Paris agreement were apparently not enough to make them question their business case. These carbon bombs are the single biggest indicator that we are not trying hard enough.\u201d\nThe study is based on data from Rystad Energy but, rather than focusing on total barrels, it identifies the mega projects potentially responsible for the biggest emissions.\n\nAccording to the research, the US is the leading source of potential emissions. Its 22 carbon bombs include conventional drilling and fracking, and span the deep waters of the Gulf of Mexico to the foothills of the Front Range in Colorado to the Permian basin. Together they have the potential to emit 140bn tonnes of CO<sub>2</sub>, almost four times more than the entire world emits each year.\nSaudi Arabia is the second biggest potential emitter after the US, with 107bn tonnes, followed by Russia, Qatar, Iraq, Canada, China and Brazil.\nAustralia, widely condemned by international leaders as a laggard in addressing the climate crisis, ranks 16th.\nRobyn Churnside, a Ngarluma elder on the Burrup peninsula in remote north-west Australia, has been fighting fossil fuel and mining developments since the 1970s. She is part of a campaign trying to stop Woodside\u2019s US$12bn Scarborough gas project, one of the biggest fossil fuel developments in the country in a decade.\nChurnside said dissenting Indigenous voices were too often ignored when decisions were made about new oil and gas infrastructure that could lock in emissions for decades and desecrate culturally significant sites, which in some cases had stood for tens of thousands of years.\n\u201cIt\u2019s about time the world listened to First Nations people because we have been here a long, long time,\u201d she said. \u201cOur spirit in this land will never rest. It needs protection.\u201d\nProf Kevin Anderson, from the Tyndall Centre of Climate Research, University of Manchester and Uppsala University, Sweden, said the scale of planned production in the face of all the evidence suggested big oil and its political supporters either did not believe the climate science or thought their extreme wealth could somehow protect them and their children from the devastating consequences.\n\u201cEither the scientists have spent 30 years working on this issue and have got it all wrong \u2013 the big oil CEOs know better \u2013 or, behind a veil of concern, they have complete disregard for the more climate vulnerable communities, typically poor, people of colour and far away from their lives. Equally worrying, they are disinterested in their own children\u2019s future.\u201d\nThe money\n\nWhen BP reported its quarterly earnings in a presentation to financial institutions in February, one analyst said he \u201creally enjoyed the camaraderie and the positivity that you\u2019re generating\u201d, before asking about the company\u2019s cash position.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve given you a lovely little chart,\u201d said Murray Auchincloss, BP\u2019s chief financial officer. \u201cCertainly, it\u2019s possible that we\u2019re getting more cash than we know what to do with. For now, I\u2019m going to be conservative and manage the company as if it\u2019s $40 [a barrel] oil. Anything we could get above that just helps, obviously.\u201d At the time, the oil price exceeded $90; today it is $106.\nThe oil industry is awash with cash. The money companies have belongs to shareholders, including pension funds, or in the case of national oil companies, to governments and, in theory at least, citizens. But the investment plans of the biggest oil companies are sharply at odds with the goal of halting the climate crisis.\nData obtained by the Guardian from the thinktank Carbon Tracker shows a dozen of the world\u2019s biggest companies are on track to commit a collective $387m dollars a day of capital expenditure to exploiting oil and gas fields through to 2030.\nA significant portion of this is for maintaining production at existing projects - some oil and gas will still be needed as the world weans itself off fossil fuels \u2013 but the exact amount is not publicly available. Nonetheless, it is clear that at least a quarter of this investment \u2013 $103m a day \u2013 is for oil and gas that cannot be burned if the worst impacts of the climate crisis are to be avoided, money that could instead be spent ramping up clean energy.\nEven more worryingly, the companies have developed further project options that might lead them to spend an additional $84m a day that would not even be compatible with a devastating 2.7C of global heating.\n\nThe world\u2019s governments agreed in the Paris climate accord to limit global heating to well below 2C, and pursue efforts to limit the temperature rise to 1.5C. For the latter, stricter goal, no new oil and gas projects are possible.\nThe Carbon Tracker data, compiled in September, uses a temperature of 1.65C to represent the well below 2C target and finds that 27% of the companies\u2019 projected investments are incompatible with this.\nExxonMobil has the largest of these climate-busting investment plans at $21m a day through to 2030, followed by Petrobras ($15m), Chevron and ConocoPhillips (both $12m), and Shell ($8m).\nIn terms of the most dangerous investments \u2013 those that could help drive temperatures beyond 2.7C \u2013 Gazprom accounts for $17m a day of this, ExxonMobil $12m, Shell $11m and PetroChina $9m.\nIf governments act on the scientific advice to rapidly reduce carbon emissions by boosting clean energy and cutting fossil fuel burning, the companies would have to write off these colossal sums as losses, hitting shareholders, pension funds and public finances. If governments do not act, the companies could cash in as the world burns.\nOverall, the international oil companies are making the biggest bets, with almost 40% of their projected investments incompatible with 1.65C. ExxonMobil is particularly high, at 56%. The national oil company average is 17%, although 56% of Petrobras\u2019s planned capital expenditure is incompatible with 1.65C.\n\u201cCompanies that continue to develop projects based on business-as-usual demand are betting on the failure of policy action on climate and underestimating the disruptive potential of new technologies, such as renewables and battery storage,\u201d said Mike Coffin at Carbon Tracker. \u201cSuch projects are either not needed or they lead to warming well in excess of Paris goals.\u201d\nA separate recent analysis based on Rystad Energy data from April, after Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, found that 20 of the world\u2019s biggest oil and gas companies remained on course to spend huge sums \u2013 $932bn \u2013 by the end of 2030 developing new oil and gas fields.\nFreeing the world from the grip of fossil fuels is made far harder by huge ongoing subsidies for the fuels, making them far cheaper than their true cost when the damage they cause is included \u2013 especially air pollution, which kills 7 million people a year. The G20 group of leading economies pledged in 2009 to phase out the subsidies but little has been achieved.\nHundreds of billions of dollars in direct financial support is received by the producers and consumers of fossil fuels every year \u2013 but they benefit from far larger subsidies by not paying for the harm burning fossil fuels causes. When the damage from the climate crisis and air pollution is accounted for, the fossil fuel subsidies reach $6tn a year, according to the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Guardian analysis shows this is equivalent to $11m a minute globally, $4m a minute in China and more than $1m in the US.\nGuardian analysis of more detailed IMF data shows drivers in the US, Canada and Australia, along with Saudi Arabia, are the world\u2019s biggest beneficiaries of subsidies for road fuels, with some governments under pressure to increase these during the current energy crisis.\n\nThe per capita subsidy for petrol and diesel across the population of Saudi Arabia was more than $1,000 a year in 2020. In the US, the road fuel subsidy per capita is $644 and about $500 in both Canada and Australia.\nJapan and Germany also appear in the top 10 of the road fuel analysis, which focused on the 54 large countries with more than 25 million people and that account for 90% of global population and subsidies. The UK per capita subsidy for road fuels was only $10 a year, indicating taxes on petrol and diesel in 2020 were close to the level of the damage burning the fuels causes.\n\nThe US is also high on the list of the biggest per capita subsidies for all fossil fuels with $2,000 a year, behind only Saudi Arabia ($4,550) and Russia ($3,560). After these countries, only Iran ($1815) is ahead of Australia ($1730) and Canada ($1690).\n\u201cTaking the Paris agreement seriously requires a rapid shift away from fossil fuels,\u201d said Simon Black, a climate economist at the IMF. \u201cGetting fossil fuel prices right will help enormously in accelerating this transition.\u201d\nThe transition\nThe shift from burning oil and gas cannot happen overnight, and a declining amount will still need to be burned during the transition to a net zero emissions global economy in 2050. The question is whether companies and governments are moving fast enough.\nThe Guardian wrote to the oil and gas companies named in its analysis and asked for their response.\n\u201cUnder the IEA net zero emissions scenario, and all Paris-aligned scenarios, all energy sources remain important through 2050, and oil and natural gas remain essential components of the energy mix,\u201d said a spokesperson for ExxonMobil.\nHowever, the role of oil and gas would be vastly reduced in 2050, and the IEA said: \u201cBeyond projects already committed as of 2021, there are no new oil and gas fields approved for development [in our net zero scenario].\u201d\nExxonMobil planned to invest more than $15bn on initiatives to lower greenhouse gas emissions over the next six years, the spokesperson said, including carbon capture and storage, hydrogen and biofuels. The company aimed to achieve net zero emissions by 2050 but only from its own operations, not the fuels it sold, therefore covering only a small fraction of the emissions from the oil and gas it sells.\nA spokesperson for Shell cited recent company statements: \u201cAs a result of [our] planned level of capital investment, we expect a gradual decline of about 1-2% a year in total oil production through to 2030, including divestments.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe world is in a race against time,\u201d said Guterres. \u201cIt\u2019s time to end fossil fuel subsidies and stop the expansion of oil and gas exploration.\u201d\n\n\u201cBy 2025, Shell expects its expenditure on [low and zero-carbon] products and services across its businesses will have increased to around 50% of its total expenditure,\u201d a recent report by the firm states. In 2022, the proportion is expected to be more than 35%. In 2021, \u201cShell achieved its annual investment targets in renewables and energy solutions of $2bn-3bn\u201d, the report says.\nConocoPhillips also cited a recently published net zero emissions plan: \u201cOur goal is to support an orderly transition that matches supply to demand and focuses on returns on, and of, capital while safely and responsibly delivering affordable energy.\u201d\nThe document states that profits from oil and gas projects are significantly higher than from investments in renewable energy.\nConocoPhillips has allocated $200m in 2022 to reduce emissions from its operations. To reduce emissions from the burning of the fossil fuels it supplies, the company advocates an \u201ceconomy-wide price on carbon that would help shift consumer demand from high-carbon to low-carbon energy sources\u201d.\n\u201cPetrobras plans its investments considering that the Paris agreement will be successful and global temperature will be kept below 2\u00b0C,\u201d a spokesperson for the company said. \u201cOil will remain important in the coming decades, even in accelerated transition scenarios.\u201d\nThe spokesperson said the IEA\u2019s scenario for 1.65C indicated some investment in upstream projects was needed. \u201cWe are planning for highly resilient assets competitive in scenarios aligned with Paris due to their low production cost and low emissions. Petrobras is following its strategy of maximising the value of its portfolio, [with 99% of the investment on exploration] focusing on deepwater and ultra-deepwater assets.\u201d\nTotalEnergies pointed to its recent sustainability report, which it said \u201cshowed our stakeholders that we are already on the right track\u201d. The company has a target of a 30% cut in emissions from oil and gas sales by 2030 and to increase the proportion of its energy sales that are renewable from 9% in 2021 to 20% in 2030.\nSaudi Aramco and Eni responded to the Guardian but declined to comment. The other companies did not respond to the Guardian\u2019s request.\nRace against time\nThe Guardian\u2019s investigation has provided an answer to the question of how great a danger the plans of oil and gas companies pose to the climate.\nBut there is another set of questions, those for politicians and governments, that will ultimately affect the course of the climate emergency.\nWill the world\u2019s governments act to close the book on the oil companies\u2019 giant climate gamble? Will richer countries, historically most responsible for emissions, support a just transition for developing countries on the frontline of the escalating crisis?\nWould strong, immediate action lead to a financial crash, as billions of dollars are wiped off the value of some of the world\u2019s biggest companies? Or will more steady but concerted action wean us off fossil fuels rapidly, close the oil companies\u2019 cash machine and lead us into a clean energy future with a liveable climate? Only time will tell. But, unlike oil and gas, time is in very short supply.\n\u201cThe world is in a race against time,\u201d said Guterres. \u201cIt is time to end fossil fuel subsidies and stop the expansion of oil and gas exploration.\u201d\nReflecting on the war in Ukraine, he said: \u201cCountries could become so consumed by the immediate fossil fuel supply gap that they neglect or knee-cap policies to cut fossil fuel use. This is madness. Addiction to fossil fuels is mutually assured destruction.\u201d\nAdditional reporting by Jillian Ambrose, Adam Morton, Nina Lakhani, Oliver Milman and Chris McGreal."

                    "body": "Pep Guardiola has advised his players to \u201csleep, sleep, sleep\u201d before Manchester City\u2019s FA Cup semi-final against Liverpool on Saturday. The game will be City\u2019s second against J\u00fcrgen Klopp\u2019s team in seven days after Sunday\u2019s Premier League draw and their third game of the week after Wednesday\u2019s attritional draw at Atl\u00e9tico Madrid. Although Guardiola would prefer a less congested schedule, he has no complaints about City competing on all fronts at the defining end of the campaign.  \u201cIt happens for one reason: because we\u2019re fighting for all the titles,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is good news; I\u2019m saying that with a big smile, it\u2019s not that I am grumpy. I\u2019m so happy to live that. It\u2019s not an ideal situation but where in this world is an ideal situation? \u201cLook what happens two, three hours away from here [the Russia-Ukraine war]. So for tomorrow I say to my players: \u2018Have good food, sleep a lot, take a nap. Sleep, sleep, sleep \u2013 a lot of hours, as many hours as possible, then good food and tomorrow at 3.30 we will be there [for the kick-off].\u201d Kevin De Bruyne and Kyle Walker are serious doubts after respective foot and ankle injuries they sustained in Madrid. \u201cThey didn\u2019t train today,\u201d Guardiola said. \u201cWe\u2019ll see tomorrow but apparently it\u2019d be so [too] close after what happened on Wednesday. He [Walker] had a big twist, and he is getting better but we will see the process for the next hours and next days for the next games.\u201d Zack Steffen has been City\u2019s domestic cup goalkeeper in place of Ederson, the club\u2019s No 1. Guardiola has not decided whether the American will start against Liverpool.  \u201cI am going to think about it,\u201d he said. \u201cWe still have until training tonight [Friday] and then speaking with the doctors and physios regarding the condition of many players. Tonight or tomorrow morning I\u2019ll decide but of course in the FA Cup normally we play Zack.\u201d This is City\u2019s fifth FA Cup semi-final under Guardiola, though they have reached only one final. \u201cThis is an incredible achievement and shows our consistency,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we didn\u2019t perform well in these semi-final games [that were lost]. Hopefully we can perform a little bit better. We have a chance to reach the final in a storybook tournament.\u201d"

Erik ten Hag\u2019s side have been looking to reinforce their midfield all summer, and will look to close the deal on Friday after submitting an official offer late on Thursday evening. The fee could rise to \u20ac70m (\u00a359.2m) if certain clauses are met.  Talks will now continue with the player\u2019s camp, with United offering a four-year contract plus an option to extend for a further season. Casemiro\u2019s current deal at Real Madrid runs until 2025. United\u2019s football director, John Murtough, is working directly on the deal after coming under pressure for a slow summer of transfer business so far. Now 30 years old, Casemiro has won five Champions Leagues and four Spanish titles with Real Madrid after joining them from S\u00e3o Paulo in 2013. Real have recruited Aur\u00e9lien Tchouam\u00e9ni from Monaco this summer and retain an interest in Bruno Guimar\u00e3es \u2013 but Newcastle will not entertain offers for their midfielder. United sit bottom of the Premier League after defeats to Brighton and Brentford in their first two matches. The club have been working frantically to bolster Ten Hag\u2019s squad after their dismal start, having recruited Tyrell Malacia, Christian Eriksen and Lisandro Mart\u00ednez earlier this summer. Talk of a medical for Casemiro on Friday appears premature, which means he would not be registered in time for Monday night\u2019s Premier League clash with arch-rivals Liverpool at Old Trafford. If the deal goes through, the Brazilian will be reunited with former Real teammates Cristiano Ronaldo and Rapha\u00ebl Varane in Manchester. The board have more irons are in the fire as United look to kickstart their ailing campaign, with PSV winger Gakpo, a player suggested by Ten Hag, still on their shortlist. United could also try and revive a move for the Ajax winger Antony, although the Dutch side are currently unwilling to sell. Protests are planned against the Manchester United owners before and during Monday\u2019s clash with Liverpool. The Ineos owner, Sir Jim Ratcliffe, has publicly declared his interest in buying the club from the Glazer family."

                    "body": "The idea that the Coalition can borrow money to build car parks in marginal seats but must \u201csave up\u201d money to build up an emergency relief fund is absurd. It\u2019s not based on any sound principle of economics, finance or even politics. It\u2019s purely driven by the prime minister\u2019s need for a regular flow of \u201cannounceables\u201d.\nWhile the prime minister is in Lismore on Wednesday to declare a national emergency and announce flood funding, Australians \u2013 and in particular disaster-stricken communities \u2013 are growing tired of his \u201cannounce early, announce often\u201d modus operandi.\nScott Morrison\u2019s latest problem is that his rhetorical support for small government has crashed into the climate-changed reality of what communities like Lismore need in the days after their unprecedented floods, and what those in places like Bega are still waiting for years after their unprecedented bushfires. \n\nAustralia is one of the richest countries in the world, but while there\u2019s no shortage of money to fund the $16bn-a-year stage three tax cuts for our highest-income earners, when it comes to helping families and businesses recover from the complete devastation of record floods and fires, apparently we need to hasten slowly. Rather than rushing jobkeeper money out the door the way they did to help the likes of Harvey Norman, when it comes to climate-induced disasters it seems the Coalition thinks we need to save for a rainy day.\nThe problem is that it\u2019s already pouring. Like the CSIRO, the Bureau of Meteorology, the IPCC and the Australian insurance industry, the Morrison government knows that cyclones, storms, floods and fires have already become more common, more intense and more expensive. That\u2019s why they announced a $10bn insurance fund to help subsidise the cost of insurance in politically powerful far-north Queensland.\nThe National party may house most of the climate sceptics in the federal parliament, but it doesn\u2019t stop them demanding public cash to help their constituents deal with climate impacts.\nThere is no economic reason the Australian government needs to \u201csave up\u201d billions of dollars in a disaster relief fund. Even if it had wanted to prepare, the time to start saving was back when John Howard was prime minister. If the Coalition knew the disasters were coming (which they did) and thought balancing the budget was important (which they do) then they should have started scrapping fossil fuel subsidies and stockpiling our pennies in their \u201cspecial funds\u201d decades ago. But now, like firefighters trying to save water during a bushfire, we have a government telling people who are still homeless after the 2020 bushfires to keep waiting.\n\nThings are only going to get worse. Climate change isn\u2019t caused by accident, it takes decades of careful planning and more than $10bn a year in Australian fossil fuel subsidies.\nWhile a carbon price raised a lot of money and reduced a lot of emissions, such economic orthodoxy remains too radical for Australian debate. However, removing the billions of dollars Australia spends on oil, gas and coal subsidies would provide a big price signal and an enormous flow of annual revenue needed for a genuine climate adaptation fund. That is, if we really wanted one.\n\nLikewise, our very profitable, but very lightly taxed resources industry. Qatar, the second biggest exporter of LNG behind Australia, collects 20 times as much tax from their gas exports than we do ours. Australia Institute research estimated that a measly $1 a tonne levy on the carbon dioxide embodied in our fossil fuel exports would raise over $1.5bn a year.\nAlthough the Coalition\u2019s subsidies largesse wasn\u2019t enough to drive a \u201cgas-led recovery\u201d, Putin\u2019s war against Ukraine has certainly filled gas industry coffers. The people of Ukraine and Russia bear the cost of war and sanctions. Companies around the world are walking away from their Russian investments; and yet the share price of Australian frackers has surged.\n\nThere is little the Australian government can do to prevent the price of imported petrol from rising, but there\u2019s no reason that our gas exporters need to hang on to the profits that have fallen in their lap. A windfall gains tax on the Australian gas industry is yet another source of revenue that a government that belatedly wants to \u201cstockpile emergency relief funds\u201d could tap. But it won\u2019t.\nJust as there is no shortage of money for car parks and income tax cuts, there is no actual shortage of money to help those who have lost everything in recent bushfires or floods.\nWho we elect determines what problems we solve. The Coalition has made it clear it believes the \u201cburden\u201d of income tax on those earning over $200,000 a year is more pressing than the burden of whole communities being destroyed. Likewise, it believes that subsidies to prop up the fossil fuel industry are more pressing than subsidies for renewables or climate adaptation. While some bookies have suggested that the voters of Lismore agree with the Coalition\u2019s priorities, time will tell if recent events change their minds.\n\u2022 Richard Denniss is the chief economist at independent thinktank the Australia Institute. He is the author of a new book, Big: The Role of the State in the Modern Economy."

                    "body": "Which England players strengthened their Euros hopes? Top of the list has to be Jill Scott. Sent to Everton on loan last season and to Aston Villa this season, it would be easy to think the the 35-year-old midfielder\u2019s England days were numbered. Far from it. Against Spain\u2019s Barcelona-heavy midfield Scott was instrumental. The Chelsea defender Jess Carter showed her versatility, operating as a centre-back and left-back across the three games, and performed well. Hannah Hampton\u2019s clean sheet and assured debut against Spain will have helped her edge closer to the third goalkeeper spot. SW Most notably, a quartet comprising two key partnerships. Millie Bright, Alex Greenwood, Leah Williamson and Keira Walsh were always going to be in the squad but all four strengthened their case for starting the biggest games. While Bright and the helpfully left-footed Greenwood formed an excellent central-defensive axis, Williamson and Walsh showed they can serve as a fairly formidable \u201cdouble six\u201d combo in Sarina Wiegman\u2019s apparently preferred 4-2-3-1. It seems Williamson has completed her transition from defence to midfield anchor but she is able to seamlessly revert to the rearguard should Wiegman switch to three at the back mid-match. Meanwhile Scott has reminded everyone that she remains an integral part of the squad. LT Have anyone\u2019s prospects been harmed? No one performed particularly badly but a number struggled for minutes despite heavy rotation. Jordan Nobbs produced moments of brilliance against Spain but gave away possession a little too frequently and is struggling to find the form that made her nailed on to start for Arsenal before her ACL injury. Manchester United\u2019s Katie Zelem did not play and is yet to build on her one cap. Meanwhile, Nikita Parris has not replicated her deadly Manchester City form at Arsenal or for England since a stint with Lyon. Steph Houghton is yet to play under Wiegman because of injury and City revealed on Thursday that she recently had achilles surgery and would \u201creturn to training in the near future\u201d. Her chances have been dented by the performances of Bright, Williamson, Carter, Greenwood and Rachel Daly and, with Lotte Wubben-Moy a short-term absentee, the centre-back options look strong and difficult to break into. SW  Injured internationals often joke that they become regarded as \u201cbetter players\u201d while sidelined but the opposite could, unfortunately, be true for Houghton. Even if she returns to the squad this summer, she seems unlikely to break up the Bright-Greenwood axis. Although it was good to see Houghton\u2019s City teammate Lucy Bronze return at right-back after a lengthy injury layoff, a defender still to return to full match fitness emphasised that she is often better going forward than defending. Phil Neville experimented with Bronze in midfield with mixed results and Wiegman may wonder if she could be better as a wing-back. It sounds like heresy but is there a chance Bronze may not automatically start every game at the Euros? LT What did we learn about the team\u2019s Euros chances? It is hard to take a huge amount from a series of tight friendlies. Germany had 12 key players missing owing to injury and Covid, and 12 of Canada\u2019s squad play in the US, which is off-season. However, matches against three nations ranked in the top 10 have offered the clearest look at whether England can challenge the best. The answer? Yes they can and, more importantly, there are significant signs of growth. The defensive issues that blighted Neville\u2019s tenure look as if they are being ironed out and the team are creating chances. That is a solid platform. SW  Although the picture remains pretty opaque there was further evidence that England\u2019s improvement under Wiegman is no illusion. But, despite playing their best football for a long time, they remain very much a work in progress and aren\u2019t always great at seeing out games they should win. Moreover this promises to be an extremely strong Euros featuring particularly powerful opponents in Germany, France, Sweden, the Netherlands and an improving Spain. The good news for the Lionesses is that Wiegman, having led the Netherlands to Euro 2017 glory and the final of the 2019 World Cup, is one of those adaptable coaches eminently capable of finding a way to win. And in Fran Kirby and Lauren Hemp England possess two outstanding attacking talents. LT What are the biggest lessons for England? England had scored goals aplenty under Wiegman before this competition \u2013 53 in six games \u2013 but were wasteful in a number of those matches. Against tougher opposition the team need to be more clinical. Wiegman is yet to get the best out of the world-class creator Kirby and that could be critical in that regard. Playing wide against Germany the Chelsea forward struggled. It is a role she plays often at club level but as part of a much more dynamic front three who bounce off each other. Against Germany she provided the assist for Ellen White when she drifted more centrally and was most effective when later moved into that position behind White, with more of a free rein. SW  Concentrate, concentrate, concentrate. The collective defensive focus is showing signs of considerable reassuring improvement from the latter days of Neville\u2019s tenure when key players developed an unfortunate habit of switching off at vital moments but they need to maintain it. Meanwhile Wiegman will surely want to keep White, her most reliable goalscorer, swaddled in cotton wool. White\u2019s understudies are infinitely less ruthless and far from convincing. LT"

                    "body": "Activists dumped 1,000 litres of an oily substance on the track at Flemington Racecourse during an illegal break-in on Tuesday morning, but the action failed to stop the Melbourne Cup. Nevertheless, it was a sombre start to a day tainted by growing backlash and impassivity towards the \u201crace that stops the nation\u201d. A media release issued by the alleged perpetrator identified them as a \u201cproblem gambler\u201d who has been disaffected by the harms of racing. \u201cThe existence of this industry means that a select few get richer whilst normal punters go broke,\u201d they wrote. \u201cThe Melbourne Cup is the super-spreader event for the virus of gambling addiction.\u201d  The show went ahead after a last-minute track assessment and remedial cleaning and repair work. The Victoria Racing Club said it was \u201cdisappointed\u201d by the actions of protesters who had caused \u201cminor damage\u201d to the track\u2019s 1,500 metre mark. \u201cStewards deemed the track to be safe and there was no impact to racing,\u201d the club said. \u201cA police investigation is under way.\u201d But spirits were \u2013 figuratively and literally \u2013 dampened. The track was downgraded to a soft seven prior to the main event, with further rain forecast in the late afternoon. After a brief shower between the first and second races, the conditions deteriorated at about 12.30pm. Steady rain and gusting winds had those who braved the conditions looking for any cover they could find. At that stage, tickets were still available at the entrance. The downpour proved too much for a quartet of young women who hailed a ride-share vehicle once the burst stopped and directed the driver to take them to Chapel Street. Of those who remained, many opted for plastic ponchos to shield themselves from the torrent. While the rain cleared for the marquee event, the track remained sodden as Mark Zahra guided Gold Trip to victory, seizing the lead 300 metres from the finish line and holding off Emissary. A Melbourne Cup Carnival partnership with GIVIT to support flood-affected communities \u2013 which received a $500,000 donation off the bat \u2013 was dismissed by some as a cynical move. Lingering anger over a controversial 2.5-metre flood wall that spared Flemington Racecourse during the recent floods remained. Some local people displaced by the Maribyrnong River\u2019s worst flood in 50 years believed their homes wouldn\u2019t have been flooded in October if it weren\u2019t for the wall.  The fundraiser came after the chair of the Melbourne Racing Club, Mike Symons, tweeted \u2013 and quickly deleted \u2013 a comment lauding investment in the wall as preventing \u201cthe 100 year flood event from impacting the Melbourne Cup carnival\u201d. Climate activist group Extinction Rebellion said it \u201cfully endorsed\u201d the message of the morning\u2019s disruptors, who it described as \u201cfriends\u201d.  While the wintry conditions had a significant impact on the crowd, both inside the track and away from it, even under cover it felt less crowded than before the pandemic.  Some had turned elsewhere for entertainment. Across the road from Flemington, the Coalition for the Protection of Racehorses (CPR) ran its seventh \u201cNup To The Cup\u201d event, complete with a \u201chuman race\u201d and \u201cfarshans on the field\u201d. The associated #NupToTheCup hashtag was trending on Twitter, as thousands expressed animal welfare concerns and disaffection with the industry.  Greens senator Mehreen Faruqi said the social licence of the racing industry was \u201cclearly fading\u201d.  The latest Guardian Essential poll found almost half of those surveyed (45%) believed the race promoted \u201cunhealthy\u201d gambling behaviour, with a third (34%) saying it normalised animal cruelty \u2013 echoing similar findings in Greens-commissioned research. \u201cYoung people, in particular, are switching off,\u201d Faruqi said. \u201cThey understand the cruelty and toxicity of racing. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t know that, though, from the massive marketing campaigns from the racing and gambling industries that are designed to make events like the Melbourne Cup appear universally loved.\u201d"
