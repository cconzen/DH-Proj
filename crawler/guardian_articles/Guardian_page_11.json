                    "body": "Good morning. 23 December is obviously the start of the slow climb to Christmas, so it\u2019s time to look back on 2022. With reviews of the year in abundance this week, I thought I\u2019d better lean in to First Edition\u2019s most important point of difference: the stuff that really grinds my gears. So: here is a list of 17 things from 2022 that it would be much better never to hear about again \u2013 a kind of bully pulpit, except the occupant is wearing pyjamas, eating a depressing bowl of Fruit \u2018n Fibre, and trying to stop the dog from befouling the kitchen out of spite. Hopefully you\u2019ll find something here that really annoys you, too. When you\u2019ve finished, simply delete this email to free yourself of the spectres herein, and get on with Christmas and the rest of your life. You\u2019re welcome. In depth: 17 things we never want to hear about again after 2022  \u2018Cut-through\u2019 Yes, OK, it is fair to say that a news story will be more consequential if the public is aware that it has happened. But did every broadcaster need to re-establish this extremely basic principle by maniacally shouting \u201ccut-through\u201d like TV lawyers making an objection every time they talked about Partygate? See also: the unwelcome return of the word cloud, mostly because people find it funny seeing \u201ctwat\u201d in big letters about Boris Johnson. Flight-tracker apps The first gleeful search for a politician/famous person\u2019s plane that really achieved CUT-THROUGH was when Priti Patel was on her way home to get sacked in 2017, but this year it\u2019s really gone nuts. Wilfred Chan wrote this very good piece about the phenomenon in July, noting that more than 2.9 million people logged on to watch Nancy Pelosi wavering over Taiwan and recording the obsessive devotion of football fans on transfer deadline day. Now Elon Musk is banning people from Twitter for (so he claims) tracking him with \u201cbasically assassination coordinates\u201d, which seems like a stretch, and it suddenly seems much too late to say: sorry, lads, but tweeting about where a red dot is on a map definitely isn\u2019t Bellingcat-level open source work. \u2018You\u2019re helping Putin\u2019\u201cReminder,\u201d one columnist tweeted on 19 October, the day the Conservative party imploded in parliament over Liz Truss\u2019 leadership. \u201cPutin\u2019s watching all this. Genuinely.\u201d Which \u2026 I can\u2019t prove it, but given Putin was about to declare martial law in four occupied provinces and his troops were bracing for a Ukrainian attack on Kherson, I\u2019m pretty sure he wasn\u2019t paying rapt attention to who Jacob Rees-Mogg did or didn\u2019t bundle into the \u201cno\u201d lobby for a fracking vote. Now the Putin-helpers also extend to NHS workers striking over low pay, according to Nadhim Zahawi. Folks: Russian state TV will literally run stories about cyborg western babies controlled by smartphone. They aren\u2019t that fussed about the stance of the independent pay review body. Brand condolences for the Queen I mean, I say good riddance to this, but can we also caveat that with the observation that when @CrossFitUK posted a tribute workout involving 70 jumping lunges for 70 years on the throne and a minute\u2019s silence to rest, it did bring a little bit of welcome levity? Martin Lewis Don\u2019t get me wrong: big Martin Lewis fan here. But it does seem like it\u2019s time for broadcasters to train up some other people who can talk about the cost of living crisis in terms comprehensible to the average human being, and I fear we\u2019re running Mart into the ground. If Marcus Rashford\u2019s sneering critics on the right were able to blame his loss of form on his political activism, it can only be a matter of time until the complaints start to roll in about deteriorating travel insurance deals on MoneySavingExpert. Saying that \u2018the grownups are back in charge\u2019 People really did come out with this a lot after Sunak arrived. And while it\u2019s true that the sense of ongoing political arson did soften a little, this tendency also fed a sense that an alarming number of observers are satiated by a nice suit. As Frances Ryan wrote: \u201cThe standard for leadership in this country is now so low that the Conservatives could appoint Hannibal Lecter to steady the ship and sections of the British commentariat would praise him as a \u2018safe pair of hands\u2019.\u201d  Praising Keir Starmer for being boring Very much a companion complaint to the previous. Started with this report that Starmer was annoyed that his shadow cabinet were calling him boring, and then metastasised into hot takes arguing that being boring was actually genius, and then even hotter takes suggesting that it would be a bad thing if people chanted his name. To be clear: I think he\u2019s quite boring. This isn\u2019t a political stance, I just think it. I also think he would do better if more people liked him and I don\u2019t think that\u2019s feeble naivety. Leave me alone. The declaration of \u201cculture war\u201d about things which are obviously not culture wars See this fantastic Daily Telegraph headline, which asserts that the question of whether or not to kill slugs is \u201cThe new culture war dividing gardeners\u201d. The woke mob are taking over your allotment!!! Bounty bars and dubious claims of confectionery scarcity Mars Wrigley will sell many thousands of boxes of Celebrations this Christmas. It took the Bounties out of A PORTION of the boxes on sale at FORTY stores for A SINGLE DAY, and it successfully kicked off an absolute publicity bonanza. Esther Addley anatomised the whole thing effectively, while I sent my friends long and unwelcome voice notes about it which I\u2019m certain they never listened to. You\u2019ll never go broke betting on the British appetite for naming junk food brands at each other in lieu of a conversation, was my main takeaway. The speed of the prime ministerial rehabilitation cycle It just seems to get faster and faster, and the level of intervention required to get the internet misty-eyed about the good old days lower and lower. John Major had already been co-opted as part of the spider-brooch rebellion; now Theresa May is on board because she didn\u2019t clap Boris Johnson at his final PMQs. Then Johnson got plaudits for being such a grown-up when he made a speech about the Queen, literally his favourite thing to do. And already sympathetic clucking can be heard about how long Liz Truss will spend as an ex-prime minister, and how awkward it is that she has to show up at ceremonial events knowing how much more Johnson is earning than her on the speaking circuit.  Elon Musk tweeting that something is \u2018interesting\u2019Usually in response to someone on the radical right, who will immediately celebrate it as wholesale endorsement of whatever crackpot theory they\u2019ve just brought to their idol. Doesn\u2019t get less unsettling the more you see it, somehow. People who say \u2018annoying all the right people\u2019 about behaviour that is obviously morally repugnant A successor to lib-owning, but more twee. Definitely annoys me, mostly because it thinks it\u2019s so much funnier than it is, but admittedly therefore still works, as I am probably one of the right people to annoy. Discussion of whether The Crown is obliged to be realistic COME ON. In The Queen, Helen Mirren cries while having a stare-off with a mystical stag which then disappears, and nobody seems to have minded that. Claims from Matt Hancock that we need to see \u2018the real\u2019 him, \u2018warts and all\u2019 I was fine without a view of Matt\u2019s warts, thanks. Joe Lycett discourse I like Joe Lycett. I don\u2019t care if he once got paid a trivial sum to do a gig in Qatar or think it in any way undermines his activism. I am entirely alive to what a predictable cycle of sniping at someone who tries to do something decent this is. But also, I don\u2019t want to read any more about Joe Lycett for a while. Robbie Williams\u2019 definition of hypocrisy \u201cIt would be hypocritical of me not to go to Qatar,\u201d Williams said in an interview about his forthcoming World Cup performance. \u201cI don\u2019t condone any abuses of human rights anywhere. But if we\u2019re not condoning human rights abuses anywhere, I wouldn\u2019t even be able to perform in my kitchen.\u201d Which is total Horlicks, clearly, but did at least bless us with this cheering reply: \u201cRobbie, what are you doing in your kitchen?\u201d Compound swears You know the sort of thing: expletives with trumpet, puffin, womble, or similar quaint two-syllable words tacked on the end. Not a new thing in 2023, to be honest, but still with us, and always worth trying to crack down on when you have the opportunity. Happy Christmas, titgibbons! What else we\u2019ve been reading  Here\u2019s a helpful guide to the key findings in the January 6 committee\u2019s final report, which has now been released. This essay by David Remnick in the New Yorker makes the case for why the report matters, even if no charges are ever brought: \u201cthe existence and the depth of the committee\u2019s project represents a kind of hope\u201d. Archie Dancing is a healthy, exhilarating and most importantly fun thing to do, but many people, as they get older, start to retire their dancing shoes. Phil Hilton writes about how, as a \u201ccloset clubber\u201d, the ageism rife in nightlife has meant that \u201ca whole seam of joy closed down\u201d. \u201cI have always been a clubber. I have just learned to keep it secret,\u201d Hilton writes. Nimo David Shariatmadari\u2019s account of trying to come up with the next Wordle is just a preposterously enjoyable, fascinating read \u2013 like the game, a genius idea, beautifully executed. And play Wordiply here now \u2013 I missed the longest word by one this morning, and I\u2019m extremely irritated about it. Archie As the UK government threatens to block new Scottish legislation easing the path to get a gender recognition certificate for trans people, Pippa Crerar writes that \u201csome Tories believe they can boost their vote in Scotland at the next election if they reduce politics, once again, to culture wars.\u201d Archie For some people (me) buying a new item of clothing that looks just as good as you imagined it would gives you a kind of euphoric, but ultimately ephemeral, high. Enter: rental fashion. Chloe Mac Donnell dives into how it became so big, and whether it really is as good for the planet as it claims to be. Nimo  The front pages  \u201cNHS bosses urge PM to intervene to avoid war of attrition on strikes\u201d \u2013 the Guardian\u2019s front page splash this Friday. \u201cKing\u2019s Xmas safety fears\u201d, says the Mirror, adding that the \u201ctraditional royal walkabout\u201d is under review because of possible protests. \u201cMurderer was free to kill after probation blunders\u201d says the Telegraph, about the hideous crimes of Damien Bendall. The Financial Times has \u201cBadenoch \u2069 joins EU critics in attacking \u2066Biden green subsidies as protectionist\u201d. \u201cWe WILL have a merry Xmas,\u201d says the Daily Express, adding that after a \u201cyear of misery\u201d, Britons are \u201cdetermined to splash what\u2019s left of their cash\u201d for the sake of the season. \u201cGot a cough or cold? Stay away from grandparents\u201d is the advice, says the Times, \u201cas flu cases rise\u201d. The Daily Mail has \u201cMinisters threaten to block \u2066Sturgeon\u2019s gender law\u201d and says the SNP is on a \u201ccollision course with Westminster\u201d. \u201cStrictly Gio dating Hamza girl\u201d \u2013 that\u2019s the Sun. Something for the weekend Our critics\u2019 roundup of the best things to watch, read and listen to right now  TVRiches (ITVX)There is a moment in this big, juicy melodrama in which a scorned wife throws a bowl full of fruit across a boardroom table and screams, \u201cYou bitch!\u201d It\u2019s a good indication of the level of bombast this drama is going for, which seems to be Empire meets Dynasty meets Footballers\u2019 Wives. Soapy, slick and thoroughly enjoyable. Rebecca Nicholson BookCells: Memories for My Mother by Gavin McCreaIn his deeply affecting memoir, McCrea reconstructs and dissects traumatic scenes from his past. Raised in Dublin, we find him back after a 20-year absence and living with his mother who is in the early stages of dementia. There is much to be gleaned here about the damage inflicted within families, but most poignant is the author\u2019s journey towards self-knowledge. Fiona Sturges FilmThe Queen of Spades Ambition, sin and horror are the keynotes of Thorold Dickinson\u2019s brilliant 1949 melodrama based on the story by Pushkin, restored in 4K. The density of visual detail and incident on screen is superb and the swirling, delirious onrush of storytelling is addictive. This is surely one of the great gambling movies, and one that makes its connection with theology explicit. Peter Bradshaw PodcastLondon Pub ReviewsDecember means one thing for aficionados of London public houses: the return of the Tim Key-hosted deep dive into the finest places to find quality craft ale. Each venue gets an enjoyably daft five-minute narrative about the experience of drinking there, from squabbles over dartboards to surreal skits about a hurricane caused by a toilet hand dryer. Alexi Duggins Today in Focus  Looking back at 2022 The Guardian\u2019s editor-in-chief, Katharine Viner, talks about how the newspaper covered a year that witnessed war in Europe, three UK prime ministers, the death of the Queen and a winter of industrial strife Cartoon of the day | Ben Jennings  The Upside A bit of good news to remind you that the world\u2019s not all bad  The United Nations Biodiversity Conference, Cop15, has been a long time coming \u2013 because of the pandemic countries have not convened in many years and so this conference was a particularly pressurised event to set the targets and allocate funding for conservation for the next decade. While there was a lot of drama and tension, the final agreement is impressive, backing big funding announcements and centring indigenous land rights in its proposals. The initial \u201c30x30\u201d plans to protect 30% of the planet by 2030 were changed into the \u201c30x30x30x30\u201d: 30% protection and 30% restoration in exchange for $30bn of funding for conservation by 2030. Despite a considerable amount of bad blood between the two nations, China and Canada put their divisions aside for the good of the planet.

We\u2019ll back to do it all again tomorrow. \n\nUpdated at 6.01am GMT\n\n\n 5.48am  \n\nCovid fine cancellations have underlined a sense of unfair treatment in western Sydney, reports Mostafa Rachwani. While the move has come as a relief to many families, some say it has also damaged the \u2018already fragile trust\u2019 communities had in government\u2019s decisions.\nRead more:\n\n\n\n\n 5.39am  \n\nIranian authorities said they would review a decades-old law that requires women to cover their heads, as the country struggles to quell more than two months of protests linked to the dress code.\n\u201cBoth parliament and the judiciary are working [on the issue],\u201d of whether the law needs any changes, Iran\u2019s attorney general Mohammad Jafar Montazeri said on Saturday.\nQuoted by an Iranian news agency, he did not specify what could be modified in the law by the two bodies, which are both largely in the hands of conservatives.\nThe review team met on Wednesday with parliament\u2019s cultural commission \u201cand will see the results in a week or two\u201d, the attorney general said.\nRead more:\n\n\n\n\n 5.21am  \n\nFans turned out in big numbers at Sydney\u2019s Darling Harbour live site to support the Socceroos as they went down to Argentina. \nA second-half goal by Craig Goodwin gave supporters some hope but Australia couldn\u2019t recover after a mistake by keeper Mat Ryan helped Argentina to a 2-0 lead. \nFans were left disappointed by the final result but expressed pride in Australia\u2019s performance in the World Cup. Socceroos supporters in Doha said they were \u2018super proud\u2019 of their team\n\nRead more from Mostafa Rachwani here:\n\n\n\n\n 5.01am  \n\nThe federal government remains hopeful the commonwealth and states and territories can come up with a solution to quell swelling energy prices when they meet this week.\nFederal minister Bill Shorten said all options remained on the table, with the stakes being too high to not reach a decision on action.\n\u201cThis issue is too important not to leave the room without it,\u201d the Labor frontbencher told Sky News on Sunday. \u201cLet\u2019s see what emerges from discussions on Wednesday.\u201d\nNational cabinet will meet this week ahead of finalising its plan for providing energy price relief, but the inclusion of coal has complicated matters, with Queensland and NSW being asked to cooperate with a plan that will temporarily cap the wholesale price of coal.\nRead more:\n\n\n\n\n 4.40am  \n\nMeter reader\u2019s dog mauling \u2018a tragic loss\u2019\nColleagues have paid tribute to 42-year-old meter reader Kane Minion, who was mauled to death by dogs on a property south of Brisbane.\nMinion was found in a critical condition on Saturday morning, but died at the scene of the attack on Ison Rd, Greenbank.\nEmergency services were called to the fenced property at 10.47am, finding the Marsden man lying unconscious in the front yard with serious injuries from a dog attack.\nThree dogs were found inside the yard, with the Courier-Mail reporting that a bandog bullmastiff and a rhodesian ridgeback cross were seized by Logan city council animal control officers, while the third dog was not taken away.\nThe property owners were not home at the time of the attack.\nRead more:\n\n\nUpdated at 4.43am GMT\n\n\n 4.23am  \n\nPersonal conversations not party press conferences will guide regional Australians on an Indigenous voice\nAs the Nationals revealed its opposition to an Indigenous voice to parliament this week, the Victorian Women\u2019s Trust were putting the finishing touches on its model of kitchen table conversations as a national campaign tool ahead of the voice referendum.\nMary Crooks, who hails from country Victoria, is the executive director of the Trust and the architect of the Purple Sage project \u2013 the original model of \u201ckitchen table conversations\u201d that engaged regional voters and acted as a lightning rod for dissent ahead of Jeff Kennett\u2019s defeat in the 1999 state election.\nIt went on to be used by independent political campaigns, including former Indi independent Cathy McGowan\u2019s 2013 victory as well as metropolitan independents such as Warringah MP Zali Steggall and the current crop of independent MPs elected in the 2022 federal election.\n\u201cWhen I first designed Purple Sage project in Victoria, way back in 1990s, the Victorian government at that time was riding roughshod over Victoria, and especially people in regional and rural Victoria,\u201d Crooks says.\n\u201cThat whole position of the National party this week, was redolent of that in my mind: \u2018You can stop right now, and pick up a ballot paper and fill it out because we know what\u2019s best for you. And if we\u2019re opposed to the voice, then you should be too.\u2019\u201d\nNow, the kitchen table model will be used across the nation in a project provisionally known as \u201cTogether, Yes\u201d.

It seems the public is happy with clubs the way they are and understand a vote for the Greens is a vote for economic ruin.\n\nAdding his voice to the release of the Greens\u2019 plan was former head of anti-money laundering at ClubsNSW turned whistleblower, Troy Stolz.\nStolz is being sued by ClubsNSW for allegedly leaking internal documents that showed more than 90% of gaming venues were not complying with money laundering regulations.\nThe 53-year-old is due to appear at a federal court hearing on Monday.\n\nMoney laundering in pubs and clubs across NSW is real and so is gambling harm \u2013 it cannot be ignored.

It is also able to explain its decisions clearly and succinctly.\nThe contrast is fairly stark, so there is obviously merit in having actual courts deal with the legal issues here.

Of course, I supported her.\n\nHe said he was also behind former Warringah Chamber of Commerce president Wendy Finianos to be preselected over another Liberal staffer, Toby Williams, in the Sydney seat of Wakehurst.\n- AAP\n\nUpdated at 12.24am GMT\n\n\n 11.01pm  \n\nGovernment claims \u2018early win\u2019 for people with disability\nHundreds of people with a disability who had been forced to sit in hospital despite being ready for discharge have been able to leave.\nNDIS minister Bill Shorten says an average of 1,400 hospital beds across Australia every night contain people with a disability who are medically fit but unable to leave while waiting for their support package.\nShorten said 350 people have been able to get their NDIS packages sorted and discharged, saving taxpayers about $1m a day, with a night in hospital racking up an average of $2,500.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a slow-moving thing, the river of reform, when you\u2019re talking about the NDIS, but we\u2019ve had some early wins,\u201d Shorten told Sky News on Sunday.\nThe number of NDIS participants fighting for legal recourse has also been significantly reduced.\nThe backlog of cases in the Administrative Appeals Tribunal has been cut down from 4,500 to 2,000 since Labor took power in May.\n\u201cAnother 2,500 this Christmas not stuck in the AAT,\u201d the minister said.\nShorten flagged that conversations needed to be had with state counterparts about supports outside the NDIS to avoid it becoming overwhelmed with demand.\n\nOne of the challenges is the NDIS was never intended to be the only lifeboat in the ocean.\nThe mix of federal state funding has been drifting towards the commonwealth picking up 63%, so we\u2019re going to have to have some fair dinkum conversations about what are the other supports were providing people with disability outside the NDIS so everyone doesn\u2019t flock to that.\n\n\u2013 AAP\n\nUpdated at 11.08pm GMT\n\n\n 10.46pm  \n\nFans frustrated at last-minute World Cup arrangements\nAs fans and supporters made their way out of the Darling Harbour viewing site for the Socceroos\u2019 round of 16 loss to Argentina, many expressed their frustration at the hastily organised event.\nCrowds were expected to stay at 6,000, but the heaving masses at Tumbalong Park far exceeded that number, with police closing the viewing site before it was full for \u201csafety reasons\u201d.\nThat left many fans locked out, with supporters piling on to staircases and benches to get a view of the screens and of the match.\n\nStuart Farrell said it had been difficult to get into the site and added he was disappointed more people weren\u2019t allowed in.\n\nLots of us got locked outside. It would have been good if they let some more people in. There were so many up there on stairs, it could\u2019ve been more dangerous if they jumped around too much.\nSix thousand people for a major sporting event is just not good enough. It looks like triple that number have turned up. It feels like they underestimated the number of people who would turn up today.\nThere should have been more screens, more viewing sites, more chances for us to come together to watch the Socceroos here. Why wasn\u2019t it here the whole time, the way Melbourne had it?\n\n\nUpdated at 12.43am GMT\n\n\n 10.25pm  \n\nBurney: the voice is about constitutional recognition\nBurney won\u2019t be drawn on when the full details for the proposal will be made public, saying she is \u201cnot going to get ahead and the government will not get ahead of the working group\u201d.\nOn whether this detail will be provided before the referendum, Burney says Australians \u201cwill be well informed and they will understand the reason for the voice\u201d.\n\nThe voice \u2013 the notion is not just about Aboriginal people, it\u2019s about us as a nation finally having constitutional recognition.\n\nBurney is asked about the attacks on her by Senator Jacinta Price. She says there is \u201cso much support\u201d for the voice out in the community.\n\nWhat\u2019s important to me is that this voice is about representing First Nations people to the parliament, to the executive government, for better outcomes and bringing this country together in an extraordinary moment of truth telling.\n\nBurney says she is confident that when a referendum comes to a vote in a year the answer will be \u201cyes\u201d:\n\nI am confident in the Australian people and I believe if the Australian people fully understand the need for this voice, the powerlessness, as described in the Uluru statement of First Nations people, and an enormous sense of fairness, I believe the vote will be \u2018yes\u2019.\n\n\nUpdated at 10.38pm GMT\n\n\n 10.19pm  \n\nBurney: voice will have no power to veto parliament\nBurney is asked whether the voice will issue a statement on all bills that come before parliament explaining whether it was consulted and what advice was provided in how it was drafted.\nBurney stresses that the body will have no power to veto the actions of parliament and its role will be advisory.\n\nIt will also not have a program delivery function. I think those things are really important to make sure the voice is available to the parliament and to the executive government for advice, and that advice can be sought and given.\n\nSpeers presses Burney on whether the body will be consulted on each individual bill and how it will work.\nBurney says her view is that it will be consulted on any issues that affect First Nations people and will give effect to basic principles of self determination.\n\nThere is no question, David, that what we have been doing is not working. There is still overcrowding, there is still communities in this country that don\u2019t have clean water.\n[\u2026]\nLet\u2019s take, for example, the fact that there is going to be a standalone First Nations domestic violence plan. It would be important to me that the voice is very much involved in advising, working alongside the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander advisory committee on that, to make sure that what is in the plan reflects what First Nations people are saying about the issue of domestic violence, for example.\nLet\u2019s think about the fact that we are going to be moving towards a standalone First Nations, or Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander cultural heritage plan. Fundamental issues of that would be advised by the voice, alongside with the alliance of First Nations people and cultural heritage. There is no doubt that what happened at Juukan Gorge cannot happen again.\n\n\nUpdated at 10.26pm GMT\n\n\n 10.15pm  \n\n\u2018Enormous amounts of work\u2019 at state and territory levels\nSpeers is trying to tease out more details of the voice, but Burney is being careful not to reveal too much. Asked about whether there will be local voices, Burney says consultation is still under way.\n\nThere is enormous amounts of work going on at state and territory levels which has to be part of where we head nationally. I see what\u2019s going on in, for example, legislation about to go into the South Australian parliament to create a voice there. There is a First Nations assembly in Victoria.\nThose things will inform, and I think, enhance a national voice. What this national voice is about is very straightforward. It is about improving the lives and the outcomes which are completely unacceptable at the moment of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, but it will also be about telling the truth in our nation\u2019s birth certificate and recognising that this country has the extraordinary gift of 65,000 years.\n\nBurney is asked whether \u201cthere are any matters that don\u2019t relate to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people\u201d?\n\nThis voice is about improving the life outcomes for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. It doesn\u2019t matter what you choose, whether it\u2019s housing, whether it\u2019s incarceration, whether it\u2019s educational outcomes, whether it\u2019s domestic violence rates \u2013 all of those things will be informed by this voice, including importantly cultural issues, the fact that there is going to be a move towards a standalone cultural heritage act, things like a standalone domestic violence strategy for Aboriginal people \u2013 these are the things that the Voice will absolutely inform.\n\n\nUpdated at 10.20pm GMT\n\n\n 10.12pm  \n\nBurney \u2018won\u2019t get ahead\u2019 of voice working group\nMinister for Indigenous Australians Linda Burney says she \u201cwon\u2019t get ahead\u201d of the efforts of a working group working on a proposed model for an Indigenous voice to parliament. Burney says those working on its design are \u201cbeing very deliberate and being very careful\u201d about the proposal being developed.\n\nThis is not something that has come out of nowhere. This has been talked about for generations with First Nations people.\n\nBurney says the government and the parliament will decide what the final design will be.\n\nThere is some very well ventilated principles that have been agreed to that will inform the design of the voice. Things like it will be representative, things like it will be accountable and transparent. It will have gender parity, it will represent Torres Strait Islanders, it will have young people and, most importantly, it will be a representative body chosen by Aboriginal communities and not usurp existing organisations.\n\n\nUpdated at 10.17pm GMT\n\n\n 10.00pm  \n\nMinister for Indigenous Australians Linda Burney is speaking to David Speers on Insiders this morning.

I couldn\u2019t even see the screen, it was just limbs everywhere.\n\u201cThe atmosphere here has been beautiful, and the setup here is pretty good, I\u2019m just not sure why they didn\u2019t have this for the group stage matches as well.\u201d\n\nUpdated at 9.56pm GMT\n\n\n 9.39pm  \nGood morning\n\nAnd welcome to another Sunday morning Guardian live blog.\nMassive crowds gathered at Federation Square and in Darling Harbour have been devastated as the Socceroos crashed out of their most successful World Cup run since 2006. Australia lost 2-1 to Argentina in a dramatic game that saw the Socceroos stage a last-ditch comeback.\nThousands of fans gathered in Federation Square in Melbourne during the early hours of Sunday morning where they let off flares in anticipation while Sydney Opera House lit up its sails in green and gold. Australia\u2019s win over Denmark marked its second-ever appearance in the round of 16, forcing cities across the country to make bigger public spaces available for crowds looking to watch the game.\nBut hopes of a win against Argentina dimmed when Lionel Messi and Juli\u00e1n \u00c1lvarez scored two goals in the first half. Australia didn\u2019t give in, fight back in a dramatic second half Craig Goodwin scoring his second goal of the World Cup in the final 10 minutes. Darling Harbour and Fed Square erupted into chaos as fans held out hope for a comeback but it was not to be.\nI\u2019m Royce Kurmelovs, taking the blog through the morning. With so much going on out there, it\u2019s easy to miss stuff, so if you spot something happening in Australia and think it should be on the blog, you can find me on Twitter at @RoyceRk2 where my DMs are open.\nWith that, let\u2019s get started ...\n\n"

                    "body": "The latest edition of the Indian Premier League kicks off this weekend. It poses some interesting questions. The IPL is gripping, high-grade stuff. Like me you may well end up watching every second of it, even as you complain loudly about the fact that, oh look, you\u2019re watching every second of it. But starting again? Really? Was there an extended period in the last two years where you could say with any real certainty that the IPL had actually stopped? Perhaps in future it might be easier to assume, unless specifically stated otherwise, that the IPL is still going on. That somewhere in the rolling T20 metaverse the commentator who shouts \u201cwow!\u201d at everything is shouting \u201cwow!\u201d as a man in a shirt daubed with cement manufacturers flat-bats one over cover, that this is simply the engine around which every other moving part rotates now.  But it still feels a week too early. England\u2019s men are still playing a Test match. There\u2019s football happening, because football must always happen. But my main objection to this sudden blotting out of the cricketing sun is that the 50-over Women\u2019s World Cup in New Zealand is in danger of being overshadowed just as it threatens to bubble up into a genuinely gripping endgame. It has been an absorbing tournament so far, simmering away, gathering depth and layers, and deserving of a free run in its final week. The weekend will see the semi-finalists culled. From the start of next week one of four contenders, South Africa, West Indies, India and England, will have the chance to create a genuine story by beating Australia, who are simply much better than everyone else right now, a team playing with a kind of light around them. It has been an intriguing tournament for England, and beyond that for one of the most storied English cricketers of the age, a performer of engaging and apparently inexhaustible competitive fury. Katherine Brunt has had a frustrating couple of weeks. Although, to be fair, every week appears to be on some level a frustrating week for a cricketer powered by uncut fast-bowler-grade irritation. This is the natural resting state of Brunt, a bowler for whom every straw is the final straw, whose competitive rage is both endlessly watchable and a driver for one of the great modern-day English sporting careers. Brunt had bowled poorly in New Zealand before taking three wickets in Thursday\u2019s victory against Pakistan, fruits of some hard-fought technical tinkering in the nets. That win leaves England needing to beat Bangladesh on Saturday to be sure of making the semis, a major turnaround after losing their first three games. And there has been something wrong with England at this World Cup. They have looked underpowered and muddled, a little soggy in those bleached-out greens and greys down the late night satellite feed. The initial selection looked like a continuity thing: one more dip for the old guard. But this has looked a stodgy crew at times, unathletic and lacking in fizz, the kind of team it\u2019s harder to get in to than out of. The spinners Sophie Ecclestone and Charlie Dean have revived England\u2019s chances. But in terms of wickets and averages England\u2019s new ball attack, Brunt and Anya Shrubsole are two of the least successful bowlers in the tournament.  Brunt, at least, will not be cowed. This is a cricketer who has a highly productive, career-long relationship with adversity, who has made a life out of refusing to stop, and who seems at all times entirely lost in this thing. Her story bears repeating. As a kid she spent evenings throwing a tennis ball at the mismatched brick in the wall of the family home, refusing to come in for dinner until she had hit it. At school she was bullied for being \u201ca bit of an oddball\u201d, and for being overweight. She trained with England\u2019s juniors but hated it (\u201cthey were not very nice people\u201d). She got into drinking. She gave up cricket. One day she decided she didn\u2019t want that. She went running with her dad, a little further each day, and eventually dropped four stone. Barnsley CC became a home. When she came back to the England setup aged 19 some of her former training mates didn\u2019t recognise her as the same person. From there it is easy to take for granted quite how relentlessly good Brunt has been, and for how long. She was England Vodafone cricketer of the year in 2006 alongside Andrew Flintoff. Three career-menacing back injuries have followed, the last at the 2018 World T20, which she left in a wheelchair. But she\u2019s still out there: a double World Cup winner, with 316 England wickets at 22, still offering control, contributing with the bat now, and still applying that unwavering will, utterly engaged in every moment of every game. There is more of course. Brunt came out as gay to her parents aged 21. It fractured her relationship with her mother. But her family is still close and her dad sounds amazing. And if some of this makes her seem like a sad story, or a heavy presence, then she is clearly not those things. Brunt is exuberant, funny, and relentlessly energetic in training. She has a house, known as \u201cAlan\u201d, that has been a kind of salon for England women\u2019s cricket down the years, and which is now shared with her fiance and England teammate, Nat Sciver, two halves (with all due apologies: but it\u2019s true) of an outstandingly high-grade English sporting power couple. What now? Brunt is 36, but still out there bouncing in with the same cartoon-squirrel sense of optimism. From here England have, at best, three World Cup games to play. The chances of beating Australia are slim, the chance of getting a shot decent enough. A fully operational Brunt will guarantee at the very least a sense of will, of something grand and unyielding, perhaps even the chance of a rare late bloom. British sport is full of gonged-up head prefect types, celebrity filler described, often laughably, as inspiration. Brunt is the real thing, a true original, and an authentically inspiring cricketer."

The manager conceded their fitness could have been a problem had they been facing a possible play-off final the following Tuesday. The final will take place in June after Scotland v Ukraine was postponed.\n\n\u201cWe took Aaron to the Czech Republic [in October] and we were concerned about the two games back-to-back and I thought he was outstanding in both games. We got to an hour in the second game [against Estonia] \u2026 and come 60, 70 minutes he was still on there shaking his head, saying: \u2018I\u2019m fine.\u2019 When they put that jersey on, they go to another level. They just keep going.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019ve ever had a camp where we\u2019ve had all our players playing the weekend before. But big players turn up for big games and they\u2019ve proven that over time. The other way of looking at it is they\u2019ll be fresh and raring to go. They\u2019re fighting fit and raring to go.

                    "body": "Pep Guardiola admitted that Manchester City\u2019s performance was not up to his required standards after they were dumped out of the Carabao Cup by the Premier League\u2019s bottom side Southampton.\nFirst-half goals from S\u00e9kou Mara and Moussa Djenepo ensured that Nathan Jones\u2019s side set up a semi-final showdown against Newcastle as Guardiola\u2019s hopes of winning the League Cup for a record fifth time came to an abrupt end. City struggled to create any meaningful chances at St Mary\u2019s on a testing night for the champions, and with the Manchester derby to come on Saturday their manager warned his players that they must put this display behind them quickly.\n\n\u201cI know my players well and today was not even close to what we are,\u201d said Guardiola. \u201cThey were better \u2013 Southampton deserve to be in the semi-finals. When you are not prepared to play this game you arrive one inch late and don\u2019t score a goal. When you are prepared you score the goal. We have to accept it and improve.\u201d\nKalvin Phillips laboured on his first start for City more than six months after joining from Leeds for \u00a342m but Guardiola refused to blame the England midfielder for his side\u2019s lacklustre display. \u201cHe has spent a lot of time injured but it\u2019s not just about Kalvin,\u201d he added. \u201cThe responsibility is with everyone when you have a bad night like this. We have to be prepared for every single game when you play for Manchester City but we were not.\u201d\nFor the second match in succession, Guardiola left Erling Haaland and Kevin De Bruyne out of his starting lineup but insisted he had no regrets over that decision. Guardiola said: \u201cWho knows if with Erling and Kevin it would have been different? But when you play for four competitions it\u2019s important to use every player in the squad.\u201d\nJones, who has still yet to pick up a point from four Premier League matches since taking over as Southampton manager in November but now finds his side in the semi-finals, was delighted with his players. \u201cIt was a complete performance. I\u2019m really proud because we\u2019ve all had to go through a lot,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve had people telling me I\u2019m not good enough but this is a reward for the last few weeks. I\u2019ve come here and we are trying to build something but it\u2019s not going to happen overnight. If they give time, I will give them a team to be proud of.\u201d"

                    "body": "Such is Brennan Johnson\u2019s glittering form for Nottingham Forest, Austria would be foolish to fixate on the usual suspects when they take on Wales in their World Cup play-off semi-final. Gareth Bale and Aaron Ramsey are the obvious stars but in Johnson Wales possess another jewel. Last Sunday a familiar scene unfolded as Liverpool became the latest team to witness what the fuss is about, as the 20-year-old tormented J\u00fcrgen Klopp\u2019s side with his searing pace, tenacity and eye for a killer pass during a testing FA Cup quarter-final. Johnson shone earlier in the competition against Leicester and Arsenal, scoring against the former when he nutmegged the Wales goalkeeper Danny Ward from an acute angle. \u201cHe is so composed,\u201d says Paul Bodin, who worked with Johnson when in charge of Wales\u2019s Under\u201119s and later with the Under\u201121s. \u201cHe can pass it with good quality when he\u2019s running. He just feeds the ball into good areas, with the perfect weight of pass \u2026 They were standout things years ago but they were not on the stage he is on now. I\u2019m sure he will go on to do it for Wales for many years.\u201d  Johnson scored three minutes into his Under-21s debut against Belgium and Bodin knew instantly he would not hang around his squad for long. Even now, there is a sense Johnson is only beginning to fulfil his potential. \u201cA couple of years ago, I don\u2019t think he perhaps believed how good he was,\u201d Bodin says. \u201cWith young players, you try to keep them on a nice calm level and I think Brennan kind of stayed on that level rather than thinking: \u2018Hang on, I\u2019m a lot a better than all of these players around me and I can reach for the stars.\u2019 He has had good management at Forest under Steve Cooper, who is used to dealing with good young players, and he has flourished again. He\u2019s got all the ingredients, he\u2019s got the right attitude, he\u2019s got great family support, so the world is his oyster.\u201d His performances this season have cemented his status as the most exciting talent in the Football League. Brentford had four bids rejected in January and are not the only Premier League team trailing the forward, who joined Forest aged eight. Born in Nottingham, he played for England Under-16s and Under-17s but qualifies for Wales through grandparents from Powys and is set to build on his seven caps in Cardiff on Thursday. Questions about his discipline off the ball have been answered, helped by a stint in central midfield as a 16-year-old to make sure he tracked runners. \u201cGary Brazil [Forest\u2019s academy manager] has developed him in a great way,\u201d says the interim Wales manager, Robert Page. Those who have worked with Johnson say the same thing about his character. \u201cHe is a genuine, quiet, modest man,\u201d Bodin says. \u201cBut once he is unleashed on to the pitch, he is a different animal.\u201d  It seems inevitable that Johnson will be in the top flight next season \u2013 ideally with Forest. He set the tone on the opening day at Coventry last August, picking up possession on the half-turn inside his own half before tearing down the right and putting the ball on a plate for Lyle Taylor on the edge of the six-yard box. \u201cI thought: \u2018He\u2019s arrived,\u2019\u201d says Bodin. A few weeks later Johnson smacked in his first Forest goal to equalise at Derby and he has since eased into double figures. It was a similar story on loan last season at Lincoln City, for whom Johnson thrived after a debut cameo off the bench. \u201cIn those 20 minutes you knew immediately what kind of impact he was going to have on us as a group,\u201d says Lincoln\u2019s head coach, Michael Appleton, who played with Johnson\u2019s father, David, at Manchester United. \u201cThe following game, against Blackpool, he started and won two penalties.\u201d Johnson is unpredictable, durable and lightning quick. \u201cIt\u2019s one thing having pace but it is another thing knowing how to use it,\u201d says Appleton. \u201cWhen Brennan gets the ball, he always looks to turn and get forward. He never really passes up responsibility. A lot of young players now want everything to feet \u2013 not enough are prepared to run in behind but Brennan was prepared to do that, which I liked. I think I played Brennan in six positions. He just got on with it and was very comfortable. I think he will naturally end up as more of a No 9, because he is prepared to run without the ball and if he does that in more central areas he will probably get even more goals.\u201d  Johnson sparkled for Lincoln en route to the League One play\u2011off final last May, the day Wales announced their Euro 2020 squad. Johnson was, Bodin says, a hairline from making the cut when Rubin Colwill, who was free to impress at a Wales training camp that month, was a surprise pick. Regardless, Johnson, who made his first competitive Wales start alongside Colwill in the crucial World Cup qualifying victory against Belarus in September, is primed to thrive. The hard part will be deciding where he plays, with Bale at home on the right, where Johnson has predominantly featured for Forest. Wales are set to revert to operating with a false No 9 with Kieffer Moore injured. \u201cGareth has been an absolute legend for his country but he knows he\u2019s got somebody young in Brennan who is snapping at his heels and is wanting that jersey,\u201d Page says."

                    "body": "  12.28pm    I\u2019m going to sign off now. Thanks for your company and emails, today and throughout the tournament. We\u2019ve had them from all round the world: Israel, Italy, Kyrgyzstan, Philippines, Iceland, France, Antarctica, New York \u2013 and a south London coffee shop. I\u2019ll leave you with Simon Burnton\u2019s report from the MCG. Commiserations to Pakistan, congratulations to England \u2013 goodbye!      12.24pm    \u201cWho knew,\u201d says Gary Naylor, \u201cthat a shake of hands between an obscure rugby league administrator and a largely unknown Kiwi player in a dingy committee room would be such a momentous occasion for English cricket?\u201d      12.21pm    More from Ben Stokes  [What is it about you and World Cup finals?] Dunno. Good fun to play in though. It was weird: it felt like the wicket got harder as the ball got older. I made sure I stayed there as long as I possibly could; it\u2019s never really panic stations when it\u2019s under eight an over. The way Mo played got us down to a run a ball. Yeah, decent, decent. There was always gonna be a time when he had to attack an over, and unfortunately for Pakistan Shaheen had to go off. It was obvious what we had to do \u2013 that over was the big one.      12.16pm    Oh, just one more thing: Lorcan Tucker, thank you.     12.16pm    There\u2019s an endearing human side to this England team, and many of them are on the field with their families. As I type, Jos Buttler is holding his child and hugging his mum. I assume it\u2019s his mum. It\u2019s such a charming scene, almost enough to make you shed a wee tear.     12.13pm    \u201cDid you spot,\u201d says Tim Sanders, \u201cthat Harry Brook\u2019s interview response of \u2018So good, so good\u2019 matched \u2018Sweet Caroline\u2019 playing over the tannoy?\u201d I didn\u2019t, though Daniel Harris messaged me the same thing. So good, so good indeed.      12.12pm    \u201cBen Stokes is a ridiculous human being,\u201d says Matt Dony. \u201cHe\u2019s just different. He has that intangible quality that just makes things happen around him. I don\u2019t understand it, but it\u2019s there. Some artists have that same influence and ability to make things bend to their will. You could surround Bob Dylan by almost any band, and he would make them sound like \u2018Bob Dylan\u2019s band\u2019. The charisma and X-factor to control and direct his surroundings and stamp his authority over it. Stokes does that to sport. The whole field, both teams, the whole situation, just bent to his will.\u201d     12.12pm   ENGLAND ARE WORLD T20 CHAMPIONS!  Jos Buttler walks over to join his teammates, silly grin plastered all over his face, and lifts the World T20 trophy to the heavens! Four months ago they were struggling after series defeats to India and South Africa. Hell, four games ago they were struggling. But they delivered when it mattered, producing one devastating performance to batter India and holding their nerve in three tight ones against New Zealand, Sri Lanka and Pakistan. As in 2019, they recovered from a worrying blip to win the last four games, with no margin for error. Oh, and Ben Stokes took care of business when it mattered. It would be wrong to call him a big-game player; he\u2019s a huge-game player.   Updated at 12.15pm GMT    12.09pm   Jos Buttler speaks   I\u2019m immensely proud of everyone here. Matthew Mott\u2019s doing alright, isn\u2019t he? This felt a long way away after the Ireland game, but the character we showed in must-win games has been amazing. [Mott] has fitted in really well. He gives the players great freedom and allows us to to out and trust ourselves. Adil has been outstanding in the last three games especially. He\u2019s always been the guy we throw the ball to to make something happen. The chase wasn\u2019t easy at all. When you hit the right length there was a bit of seam movement \u2013 they were very attacking and obviously bowled at good pace. That man again was there for us, Ben Stokes. He\u2019s the ultimate competitor in everything he does. He has a lot of experience and can take everything on his shoulders. The impetus he and Moeen Ali showed just took the game away.      12.06pm    The England team go up to receive their winners\u2019 medals. I\u2019d love to hear Alex Hales\u2019 internal monologue right now.     12.05pm    Babar Azam speaks  First of all congratulations to England \u2013 they are deserved champions. It felt like home so thank you to all the supporters. We were 20 runs short but the way we fought until the last over was unbelievable \u2013 all credit to the boys. Our bowling attack is one of the best in the world. Unfortunately Shaheen got injured and it cost us. Maybe it would have been a different result, but that\u2019s part of the game.      12.03pm    Now the Pakistan team walk up to receive their runners-up medals. They made the tournament infinitely more interesting, as they always do, and some of their fast bowling on a spicy pitch tonight was dangerously exhilarating. Naseem Shah\u2019s figures of 4-0-30-0 are an utter scandal.     12.01pm    The presentation is under way. Sam Curran walks up to officially receive his player of the match award, and his player of the tournament award, and his wide yorker of the tournament award, and his into-the-pitch slower ball of the tournament award.     12.00pm         12.00pm    While Sky are showing replays of Stokes\u2019s innings, Jos Buttler charges over to rugby tackle his best mate and predecessor Eoin Morgan. Buttler doesn\u2019t let his hair down often, which makes it an even more beautiful sight (or in this case sound, a grunt of surprise from Morgan) when he does.     11.57am    \u201cI cannot even begin to tell you how much this fabulous win means to me &amp; my family,\u201d says Karen Thorne in Slovenia. \u201cEngland cricket matches have seen us through some very difficult times health wise for us all, &amp; this feelgood win has done it again for me, recovering from major surgery as I am at the moment. \u201cMy husband has worked on cricket as an engineer for many years &amp; my daughter has been working on this match at Sky studios. Congratulations England. Well deserved.\u201d Sport, eh?  Updated at 11.58am GMT    11.55am    Here\u2019s our snap report of England\u2019s victory      11.54am    Sam Curran is also the player of the tournament!  It\u2019s amazing. We\u2019ve won a World Cup in front of these amazing fans! Thank you to everyone who came out tonight. I wanted to be adaptable coming into this tournament. I haven\u2019t bowled at the death much in my career and that\\s something I want to keep working on, the same with my batting. I\u2019m not thinking about that now \u2013 we\u2019re world champs, how good?!  Curran finished with 13 wickets at 11.38. Only Wanindu Hasaranga, who played two extra games, took more. For somebody who bowls at the death, his economy rate of 6.52 is outstanding.   Updated at 11.56am GMT    11.53am    Sam Curran is the player of the match for his spell of 4-0-12-3  I don\u2019t think I should be getting us \u2013 the way Stokesy played there, he always does it in finals. We felt the wicket wasn\u2019t as good as we thought it would be. We saw how well Pakistan bowled and it was a tough chase. On this type of ground I go into the wicket with my slower balls and just to try to keep the batsmen guessing. I don\u2019t actually\u2026 world champions, how good! [Ben Stokes] is somebody I\u2019ve always looked up to. He\u2019s the man.  It was so sweet the way Curran jumped straight into Stokes\u2019s arms at the end of the game, simultaneously his fanboy and his peer.   Updated at 12.33pm GMT    11.49am    Adil Rashid comes over for a chat with the Sky team, pats Eoin Morgan on the back and says \u201cthank you for picking me in 2015!\u2019\u201d As well as the current squad, this is a triumph for Morgan, Trevor Bayliss, Paul Farbrace and Andrew Strauss. They started all this.   Updated at 12.15pm GMT    11.48am    \u201cBen Stokes, eh?\u201d says Simon McMahon. \u201cBloody hell.\u201d     11.45am    It\u2019s worth repeating: England are the first men\u2019s team to be world champions in both ODIs and T20s. There are no asterisks any more; they sit at the top table with the greatest white-ball teams of all time.     11.44am    You have to feel for Pakistan, who bowled sensationally at times, particularly Naseem Shah. The injury to Shaheen Shah Afridi, who hurt his knee while catching Harry Brook, may well have decided the game. We\u2019ll never know. Iftikhar Ahmed has to finish Afridi\u2019s over, and Stokes belted his last two deliveries for 10. That turned the game at a time when England needed 38 from 26 balls and were in a bit of bother.   Updated at 11.48am GMT    11.43am    Ben Stokes, cricket adores you  Thank you mate [he\u2019s talking to Adam Gilchrist, not us]. I thought the way we bowled; that\u2019s what won us the game. That was a tricky wicket with a bit of bounce; you never felt like you were in. With the Ireland defeat being so early in the competition, we had to address it, say what we said and then let it go. In tournaments you can\u2019t carry baggage with you. The best teams learn from their mistakes, take on the chin and move on to the next challenge. It\u2019s a pretty good evening!      11.41am    Harry Brook speaks   So good, so good. I always thought we were gonna win it and we showed the world how good we were tonight. I thought the wicket might be a bit better! I haven\u2019t played much Test cricket but I imagine it\u2019s like that.      11.40am    ENGLAND WIN BY FIVE WICKETS WITH SIX BALLS TO SPARE I was so excited I forgot to post the final score. Stokes finished on 52 not out from 49 balls, an innings that couldn\u2019t have been more well judged if he\u2019d written it on a computer program.   Updated at 11.48am GMT    11.38am    The England players all run to Stokes, a serial winner who gets high on the kind of pressure that sends 99 per cent of humans into the bunker. We thought Stokes\u2019s scriptwriter had retired at the end of 2019, his work done. Wrong! Stokes fooled us all by batting like a clown in the games that didn\u2019t matter, and then like a nerveless genius in the ones that did. Of all the gin joints in all the world, Stokes made his first ever T20I fifty in front of 90,000 people at the MCG.   Updated at 11.42am GMT    11.37am   ENGLAND ARE T20 WORLD CHAMPIONS!  Ben Stokes smashes the winning runs! Six years on from Kolkata and Carlos Brathwaite, he has had the final say in a World Cup final! \u201cIt\u2019s Ben Stokes,\u201d says Nasser Hussain on commentary. \u201cIt\u2019s always Ben Stokes.\u201d  Updated at 11.46am GMT    11.36am    Stokes plays and misses. England need one from seven.     11.36am   FIFTY FOR BEN STOKES!  Ben Stokes hits a full toss from Wasim to reach \u2013 and how perfect is this \u2013 his first ever T20I half-century. He looks to the heavens, to his old man Ged, and then faces up again with one needed to win.  Updated at 11.36am GMT    11.35am    19.3 overs: England 133-5 (target 138; Stokes 47, Livingstone 0) Alex Hales is having a fingernail sandwich on the boundary edge. Livingstone drives his first ball for a single. Five from nine needed. \u201c\u2018m in a south London coffee shop, just because this is where I was back in 2019,\u201d says Vic Rushton. \u201cI\u2019m even sat at the same table. Tension unbearable: come on England!!!     11.33am   WICKET! England 131-5 (Ali b Wasim 19)  18.2 overs Bowled him! Moeen Ali drags a wide yorker back onto the stumps, and Pakistan are still brawling. England need five from 10 balls. Moeen made a valuable 19 from 13 balls.  Updated at 11.35am GMT    11.32am    Mohammad Wasim will bowl out. Pakistan just want to take it to the last over and hope something absurd happens.     11.32am    18th over: England 131-4 (target 138; Stokes 46, Ali 19) Haris rams a serious bouncer past Stokes\u2019s head, but Stokes takes a single off the last ball to keep the strike. England need seven off 12 balls.  Before this tournament, I doubted whether Ben Stokes should be in this team. So did you, it\u2019s okay to admit it. I am a moron, you are a moron.     11.29am    17.3 overs: England 130-4 (target 138; Stokes 45, Ali 19) Haris Rauf has to bowl his last over now; Pakistan have no choice. Stokes cuts superbly for two, which brings the target down to 8 from 15 balls. \u201cSeveral members of our English pilgrim group in Jerusalem have abandoned a guided tour of an exhibition of the Turin Shroud to follow your coverage,\u201d writes William Cash. \u201cTest Match special doesn\u2019t function in Israel. To say we are all praying is an understatement.\u201d  Updated at 11.30am GMT    11.27am    17th over: England 126-4 (target 138; Stokes 42, Ali 18) \u201cIt\u2019s almost as if the spirit of Pakistan limped off with Shaheen Shah Afridi,\u201d says Ian Smith. It was such a cruel blow: for him, for Pakistan, for the whole game. But it is part of the game, and England won\u2019t apologise this time if they win. A huge over for England ends with Moeen top-edging Wasim over the keeper\u2019s head from four. Sixteen from it, and England need 12 from 18 balls. They are this close to making history as the first men\u2019s team to be ODI and T20 world champions at the same.     11.24am    16.2 overs: England 118-4 (target 138; Stokes 39, Ali 13) England are making a dash for glory. Moeen mullers Wasim over extra cover for four and then pulls another to long leg. That makes it 18 off the last four balls.   Updated at 11.31am GMT    11.23am    16th over: England 110-4 (target 138; Stokes 39, Ali 5) Ben Stokes, the pathological winner, could be doing it in a World Cup final again! He smashes four through extra cover and then pulls a flat six over the leaping Babar at long off. England need 28 from 24 balls.  Updated at 11.23am GMT    11.21am    15.4 overs: England 100-4 (target 138; Stokes 29, Ali 5) A huge let-off for Stokes! He mistimed a big shot that landed this far short of Babar running in from long off. He thought he was out and wasn\u2019t alert to a possible second run.      11.20am   Afridi leaves the field through injury  15.1 overs: England 97-4 (target 138; Stokes 28, Ali 3) Afridi is really struggling. He aborts his run up, then beats Ali with a half-ratpower delivery. That\u2019s the only injury he\u2019s going to bowl \u2013 he limps off to a standing ovation from the Pakistan fans, and the rest of the over will be bowled by the occasional offspinner Iftikhar. \u201cOn a rail replacement bus, running 40 minutes late trying to plan my revised route home whilst tracking Englands\u2019s progress,\u201d writes Kerry Haselup. \u201cNail biting doesn\u2019t come into it. Come on Stokesy.\u201d   Updated at 11.29am GMT    11.17am    15th over: England 97-4 (target 138; Stokes 28, Ali 3) Stokes cuts Haris Rauf this far short of Shan Masood at backward point. Then he survives an appeal for caught behind after missing an attempted slog. Pakistan have only one review and Babar doesn\u2019t risk it. Replays show it\u2019s the correct decision. After taking punches all over, Stokes buzzes Haris Rauf by clattering the last ball through extra cover for four. England really needed that. They need 41 from 30 balls, and Shaheen Shah Afridi is going to try to bowl.  Updated at 11.20am GMT    11.12am    14th over: England 89-4 (target 138; Stokes 21, Ali 1) Another run-out chance! Stokes is sent back, slips and is just short when the throw from mid-on flashes past the stumps. Moeen Ali, not always the best in nervy runchases, pulls Naseem in the air but safely for a single. Stokes can barely lay a bat on Naseem, who ends a memorable spell with scandalously unjust figures of 4-0-30-0. England are now only three runs ahead on DLS. They need 49 from 36 balls \u2013 and Shaheen Shah Afridi is back on the field. That\u2019s a huge boost for Pakistan, who are now arguably favourites. He\u2019s still limping, mind you. This is incredible stuff. And you thought the tension of 2019 was a one-off.    Updated at 11.15am GMT    11.06am    13th over: England 87-4 (target 138; Stokes 20, Ali 1) Ah, so this is why they picked Ben Stokes. He moves into the twenties with a fleet-footed cut for two, and Shadab ends a lovely spell with figures of 4-0-20-1. England need 51 from 42 balls.  Updated at 11.07am GMT    11.04am    This is a problem for Pakistan. Shaheen Shah Afridi, who is a key man at the death and has two overs remaining, has limped off the field straight after taking that catch. I think his right knee may have got stuck in the turf.  Updated at 11.05am GMT    11.03am   WICKET! England 82-4 (Brook c b Shadab 20)  Oh my word. Brook dances down the track and smashes Shadab flat and hard towards long off, where Shaheen Shah Afridi slides forward to take a terrific two-handed catch in front of his face. Brook goes for a useful if increasingly nervous 22-ball 20.   Updated at 11.16am GMT    11.01am    STOKES IS NOT OUT! 12th over: England 82-3 (target 138; Stokes 18, Brook 18) It was a wonderful delivery, which roared off the seam and was extremely close to the edge \u2013 but there\u2019s nothing on Ultra-Edge and Stokes survives. Naseem Shah is 19 years old, and he is bowling one of the great wicketless spells. England need 56 from 48 balls.  Updated at 11.02am GMT    11.00am    PAKISTAN REVIEW FOR CAUGHT BEHIND AGAINST STOKES! Haris Rauf is back on the field. Naseem Shah returns to the attack and beats Brook with consecutive deliveries. The first exploded from the pitch; the second trampolined over Brook\u2019s wild yahoo. Stokes walks down the pitch in an attempt to calm Brook down, and then Brook muscles a pull over midwicket for three. Haris Rauf does unbelievably well to save a run with a sprawling stop. Naseem Shah is bowling a scintillating spell. Stokes plays and misses at three consecutive deliveries; by my count Naseem has beaten the bat 10 times in three overs. Hang on, Babar has gone for the review with that last delivery\u2026     10.56am    11th over: England 79-3 (target 138; Stokes 18, Brook 15) Brook survives a run-out chance after backing up too far. Stokes drove Shadab to mid-off, where Nawaz\u2019s stopped the ball superbly but then threw off target. Brook would have been miles out. Just two runs from an excellent over. England need 59 from 54 balls. I don\u2019t have time to type the DLS par score every over, but if England slip behind it I\u2019ll let you know. Oh what the hell, the par score is 71. \u201cFollowing in Antarctica celebrating friend Keith\u2019s birthday.,\u201d says James Kynge. \u201cIf England win I\u2019ll be sure to let the penguins know.\u201d Just as long as they don\u2019t stop play.     10.50am    10th over: England 77-3 (target 138; Stokes 17, Brook 14) Stokes times a low full toss through extra cover for four, an outstanding stroke. This is sensible, low-risk cricket from Stokes and Brook. It was always likely to be a runchase full of moodswings, and for the moment England\u2019s world is relatively calm.  Saying which, Brook is sent back by Stokes and has to scramble to make his ground. We\u2019ve had 10 overs which means there will be a result one way or another. England, who are 12 runs ahead on DLS, need 61 from 60 balls.     10.47am    9th over: England 69-3 (target 138; Stokes 11, Brook 12) Stokes would normally focus on taking the game deep, but DLS makes that a little more complicated. In the 2019 final, England were probably behind on DLS from overs 19.3 to 49.4. Stokes gets his first boundary in fortunate style, under-edging a reverse sweep down the leg side. Eight from the over. England are nine runs ahead on DLS; they need 69 from 66 balls.     10.39am    8th over: England 61-3 (target 138; Stokes 5, Brook 10) The fourth paceman, Mohammad Wasim, is on for the first time. Stokes charges his first ball and cuts it for a single. England are slightly ahead on DLS, though that will change if they lose another wicket. Every little helps, and Wasim bowls consecutive wides before Brook whips two to cow corner. He\u2019s started with admirable serenity for a young player who had such a difficult tournament.  The moment I type that, of course, he misses an attempted drive over extra cover from outside leg stump. The last ball kicks to hit him painfully on the right elbow, and there\u2019s a delay while he receives treatment. This is quite some pace attack that Pakistan have. \u201cI am sitting on a French island in the South Pacific (New Caledonia ) so no chance of coverage of cricket on French TV,\u201d says Terence Ayres. \u201cReally glad you are there!\u201d I\u2019d be really glad if I was there too.  Updated at 10.40am GMT    10.34am    7th over: England 54-3 (target 138; Stokes 3, Brook 7) It\u2019s time for the legspinner Shadab Khan. Adil Rashid got a lot out of this pitch, so he should be a threat. His second ball beats Brook, and there are five runs from a (relatively) quiet over. In other news, Haris Rauf has left the field. Adam Gilchrist says he was followed by a couple of the backroom staff, so either he has a niggle or there\u2019s a really important horse race on in the next five minutes.     10.31am    6th over: England 49-3 (target 138; Stokes 1, Brook 4) Drum and bass is having a bit of a revival, and I believe, and that fresh track you can hear is Harry Brook\u2019s heartbeat. He defends his first ball calmly and then flicks stylishly through midwicket for four. Lovely shot. DLS can\u2019t come into play until there have been at least 10 overs, but as things stand the par score after six overs is 45.  \u201cAtherton, Smith and Bishop,\u201d says Laurence Boyd of the commentary team who have just handed over. \u201cJust brilliant, desert island commentators for me.\u201d I love them all, but I couldn\u2019t leave Nasser at home.      10.28am   WICKET! England 44-3 (Buttler c Rizwan b Buttler 26)  Stokes drives the ball back to Haris Rauf, who collects and fakes as it to throw back at the batter. This is his home ground in the BBL, and he\u2019s behaving like he owns the place. And that\u2019s why! He has picked up the biggest wicket of them all! Buttler felt instinctively for a very sharp delivery \u2013 he didn\u2019t need to play - and nicked it through to Rizwan. That\u2019s another Test-match dismissal in coloured clothing, and Buttler goes after a white-knuckle ride of 26 from 17. balls. It is well and truly on!    Updated at 10.36am GMT    10.25am    5th over: England 43-2 (target 138; Buttler 26, Stokes 0) Naseem Shah beats Buttler outside off stump three times in four balls; with the other going for four wides down the leg side. Told you Pakistan were merculiar. Babar belatedly brings in a slip. Buttler has the nerve, the skill and the genitalia to walk across and scoop the next delivery off middle stump for six. That is an outrageous stroke. Naseem beats Buttler twice more \u2013 that\u2019s five in the over - to end maybe the best of the tournament. How good is this? If Pakistan get Buttler, it\u2019s well and truly on.     10.18am    4th over: England 32-2 (target 138; Buttler 20, Stokes 0) Jos Buttler and Ben Stokes are at the crease in a World Cup final again. Stokes offers no stroke to his first ball, a sizzler that only just misses off stump. Good judgement, I think. He knew sweet bugger all about the next delivery, though, which snapped off the seam to beat him off the inside. Pakistan are on one. \u201cIf it was Australia or India chasing down this total we\u2019d think the game was basically over,\u201d says Bob O\u2019Hara. \u201cBut this is England, who can always find a way. It makes me feel almost patriotic.\u201d     10.15am   WICKET! England 32-2 (Salt c Iftikhar b Haris 10)  Haris Rauf strikes in his first over! Salt, who looked a bit jittery, slugs a pull straight to midwicket and goes for 10 from nine balls. This isn\u2019t over, not by a long chalk. In other news, get your DLS tables here, 50p a copy.    Updated at 10.36am GMT    10.12am    3rd over: England 28-1 (target 138; Buttler 20, Salt 6) Another glorious shot from Buttler, who times Afridi between midwicket and mid-on for his third boundary. He has 20 from 10 balls, Salt 6 fae 6. \u201c3-12 after all four overs in a T20 World Cup final against Pakistan,\u201d says Matt Dony of Sam Curran\u2019s performance. \u201c\u2018Fairy tale\u2019 barely seems to cover it. (Although, should we be treated to a proper old-skool England collapse, just imagine his righteous fury!)\u201d Two months ago he wasn\u2019t in England\u2019s best XI; now he\u2019d probably get in a world XI.     10.09am    SALT IS NOT OUT! The impact was umpire\u2019s call, so Salt survives. It was going on to hit the stumps, though.  I\u2019m too old for this.     10.07am    This looks really close. Salt missed a pull at a slower full toss that hit him on the back pad. Was he outside leg stump? If not, he\u2019s in trouble.  Updated at 10.08am GMT    10.06am    PAKISTAN REVIEW FOR LBW AGAINST SALT!     10.06am    2nd over: England 21-1 (target 138; Buttler 15, Salt 5) Naseem Shah\u2019s first delivery swings a long way to beat Buttler, but he responds with consecutive cover drives for four. That\u2019s the most emphatic response. Buttler edges well wide of slip for a single, then Salt inside-edges his first ball between his legs for four. This is pulsating stuff. The innings has barely started and they\u2019re already trading in the centre of the ring. \u201cFor those looking and failing to find the TMS link, try GuerillaCricket instead,\u201d says David Schaub-Jones. \u201cNot to everyone\u2019s taste but has kept me entertained from Hanoi to Medellin and many places in between.\u201d I think our beloved Gary Naylor is on that; he certainly used to be.     10.00am    1st over: England 7-1 (Buttler 6, Salt 0) That was the last ball of the over. Hales\u2019s fine tournament ends in disappointment, though he shouldn\u2019t reproach himself too much. It was a storming delivery.   Updated at 10.06am GMT    10.00am   WICKET! England 7-1 (Hales b Afridi 1)  Hahaha, he\u2019s done it again! Shaheen Shah Afridi ends his first over with the customary wicket. It was a sensational inswinger that beat Hales all ends up and deflected off the back pad onto the stumps.    Updated at 10.16am GMT    9.57am    The players are back out. In a surprising development Shaheen Shah Afridi, who is so good at taking wickets in the first over, will bowl the first over.     9.46am   England need 138 to win  They would certainly have taken that at the start, but let\u2019s not get giddy. If any team can defend 138, it\u2019s Pakistan.     9.45am   Key event  20th over: Pakistan 137-8 (Afridi 5, Rauf 1) Afridi top-edges Jordan over the keeper\u2019s head for a desperately needed boundary. There\u2019s a bit of drizzle falling, though not enough for the players to go off. Pakistan steal a bye to the keeper off the last delivery, which means England need 138 to win the World Cup. The last four overs went for just 19. England started nervously, but they were increasingly ruthless as the innings progressed. Adil Rashid (4-1-22-2, including a wicket maiden) and Sam Curran (4-0-12-3) were the stars.     9.42am   WICKET! Pakistan 131-8 (Wasim c Livingstone b Jordan 4)  This is outstanding from England. Jordan beats Wasim twice and then has him caught holing out to deep midwicket. Livingstone ran in and dived forward to take a difficult catch with such little fuss that the commentator Ravi Shastri thought he had grounded it and was walking back to the boundary in disgust.    Updated at 10.10am GMT    9.39am    19th over: Pakistan 131-7 (Wasim 4, Afridi 1) A typically good spot from Tim de Lisle: no batter has hit more than two fours. Whether that\u2019s because of the pitch, the bowling, the ground dimensions or all three, I don\u2019t know. Curran continues to befuddle the Pakistan batsmen. Wasim misses a hook at a typically slippery short ball, and Curran ends with extraordinary figures of 4-0-12-3. Somewhere in the afterlife, a former Northamptonshire allrounder is beaming with pride. \u201cWhaddid I say about Brook?!\u201d writes Andy Brook, who was critical when Brook put down a tough chance on Wednesday. \u201cTotal dropper! With you on his batting though.\u201d  Updated at 9.40am GMT    9.36am   WICKET! Pakistan 129-7 (Nawaz c Livingstone b Curran 5)  Sam Curran is having a night out in Melbourrne. Nawaz flicks a full delivery straight to Livingstone at deep midwicket, and Curran has figures of 3.3-0-10-3.     9.33am    18th over: Pakistan 127-6 (Nawaz 3 Wasim 3) Dropped him! Wasim slaps Jordan to backward point, where Brook puts down a tricky diving chance. Wasim steals a single \u2013 and then gets two more when Brook\u2019s throw evades Stokes backing up. Harry Brook is going to be a star, but his performance in this tournament is slightly reminiscent of Ian Bell in the 2005 Ashes. That said, Bell was brilliant in the field so maybe I\u2019m talking nonsense. It wouldn\u2019t be entirely without precedent. \u201cI don\u2019t think there is an overseas TMS link for this,\u201d says Tom Rebbitt. \u201cIt\u2019s not on the BBC website and BBC Sounds says it\u2019s only available in the UK. I\u2019m in Munich on the way to Houston, praying this concludes before I take off!\u201d  Updated at 9.34am GMT    9.30am   WICKET! Pakistan 123-6 (Shadab c Woakes b Jordan 20)  Superb bowling from Chris Jordan. He rammed a short ball into the surface, and Shadab could only clout it to mid-off. That\u2019s a vital wicket because Shadab is very dangerous at the death.  There\u2019s no doubt that England are on top now.   Updated at 9.45am GMT    9.28am    17th over: Pakistan 122-5 (Shadab 20, Nawaz 1) Curran\u2019s third over goes for just three, and he has unreal figures of 3-0-8-2. Before this World Cup, an old Wisden.com colleague \u2013 who is usually a superb judge - texted our WhatsApp group to opine that, \u201cI wish Sammy C would just eff off.\u201d Fair to say he\u2019s been reminded of it a few times during the tournament.  Updated at 9.29am GMT    9.28am         9.26am   WICKET! Pakistan 121-5 (Shan c Livingstone b Curran 38)  Sam Curran strikes again! Shan hoicked a slower ball towards deep midwicket, where Livingstone took a comfortable catch. He goes for a useful 28-ball 38, and now Curran is the leading wickettaker since the beginning of the Super 12s.   Updated at 9.54am GMT    9.22am    16th over: Pakistan 119-4 (Shan 36, Shadab 20) For the first time since the opening match against Afghanistan, Ben Stokes is going bowl a full four-over spell.  His last over goes for 13. Shadab hammers a cut towards extra cover, where the sprawling Salt can\u2019t save the boundary. Then he pulls towards deep square, where the diving Curran saves a run. Every little helps. Stokes finishes a mixed spell with figures of 4-0-32-1. \u201cI\u2019m with Jack Sidders,\u201d says Sara Torvalds. \u201cNot on a stag do in Vienna, admittedly, but I\u2019d love the overseas TMS link as well, as I\u2019m at home in Karis, Finland. Go England!\u201d     9.17am    15th over: Pakistan 106-4 (Shan 34, Shadab 9) Shadab slices Jordan high in the and not far short of Hales at third man. Shan, who is batting fluently, clatters Jordan into the ground and over extra cover for four. He has 34 from 23 balls, Shadab 10 from 8.  Pakistan are heading for\u2026 if not a par score, then at least one that gives their bowlers a chance. That\u2019s all they ever asked for/     9.12am    14.1 overs: Pakistan 98-4 (Shan 28, Shadab 8) Jordan\u2019s first ball thumps Shan on the side of the helmet, which leads to a break in play while he is checked for concussion. He\u2019s fine.   Updated at 9.22am GMT    9.11am    14th over: Pakistan 98-4 (Shan 28, Shadab 8) Shadab\u2019s a high-class legspinner himself, so he has less trouble picking Rashid. He muscles a boundary back over the bowler\u2019s head, and four singles make it eight from over. Rashid ends a seriously good spell of 4-1-22-2 by ripping one past Shadab\u2019s outside edge.  \u201cDoes anyone have the overseas TMS link? \u201c says Jack Sidders. \u201cIt is possible it was already shared but I\u2019m on a stag do in Vienna and I\u2019m struggling to read dense blocks of text at the moment.\u201d Blimey, is it Australian time in Vienna as well?  Updated at 9.13am GMT    9.08am    13th over: Pakistan 90-4 (Shan 26, Shadab 2) Shan Masood turns Stokes to fine leg for two. Buttler was very nonchalant about receiving the throw, perhaps not realising how tight the second run was. That said, I think it would have needed a direct hit to run Shan out. England have used up their fifth-bowler allocation now, though don\u2019t be surprised if Livingstone bowls Chris Woakes\u2019s fourth over, like he did against India. \u201cWatching from a sunny Naples hoping the weather will hold in the MCG, the home of Shane Warne, arguably the greatest leg-spinner of all time,\u201d writes Colum Fordham. \u201cIt looks like Adil Rashid is taking over his mantle with his guileful googlies and luscious leggies. He certainly bamboozled Babar. But the sheer unpredictability of Pakistan promise to make this a thriller. Merlot eh? Had a bit of the local Aglianico red yesterday evening but some strong tea seems to be doing the business.\u201d     9.04am   WICKET! Pakistan 85-4 (Iftikhar c Buttler b Stokes 0)  Another one! The dangerous Iftikhar Ahmed has gone for a six-ball duck, nicking a sharp lifter from Stokes through to Buttler. That was a Test-match dismissal dressed in coloured clothing.   Updated at 9.42am GMT    9.01am    12th over: Pakistan 84-3 (Shan 23, Iftikhar 0) The new batter Iftikhar is beaten consecutive deliveries from Rashid, who is bowling marvellously. In fact, that\u2019s a wicket maiden. The ball is turning a lot, which will interest Shadab Khan in particular. Rashid has figures of 3-1-14-2.   Updated at 9.02am GMT    8.58am   WICKET! Pakistan 84-3 (Babar ct and b Rashid 32)  Sound the match-up klaxon: Babar has fallen to Rashid once again! It was an unusual dismissal. Babar didn\u2019t pick the googly, tried to cut it and could only screw the ball back down the ground. Rashid swooped to his right to take a good catch. That\u2019s a huge wicket.    Updated at 9.15am GMT    8.57am    11th over: Pakistan 84-2 (Babar 32, Shan 23) Liam Livingstone comes on for Chris Jordan \u2013 and his first over disappears for 16! It was obvious from the start that Shan Masood was going to target him. After a couple of sighters, he smeared four back past the bowler and then launched a big six over long on.  \u201cHaving checked the weather radar for the 194th time today, I can probably stop worrying about complex mathematical equations and start worrying about things on the pitch,\u201d says Phil Withall. \u201cThere\u2019s an old sporting maxim about winning the moment and that seems to apply even more in T20, the shorter format offering less time for redemption. Fascinating couple of hours ahead. I still think England will win but I have been up for 16 hours and may well have been on the Merlot...\u201d     8.51am    10th over: Pakistan 68-2 (Babar 29, Shan 11) Rashid\u2019s second over is expertly milked for nine runs \u2013 two twos, four singles and a wide. Pakistan are manoeuvring the ball well, taking advantage of the huge outfield to put England\u2019s bowlers under pressure. That\u2019s drinks. I think both teams will be reasonably happy with the score, if not necessarily with how they\u2019ve played.  Updated at 8.54am GMT    8.47am    9th over: Pakistan 59-2 (Babar 27, Shan 5) Chris Jordan replaces Ben Stokes (2-0-14-0). Babar, who is starting to find that sweet, sweet spot in the middle of his bat, flicks a short ball off the hip for four. The usual ones and twos make it a good over for Pakistan \u2013 nine from it. Babar has 27 from 23 balls, Shan 5 from 6.     8.43am    8th over: Pakistan 50-2 (Babar 22, Shan 1) Shan is beaten first up by a nice googly. He gets off the mark with a swept single, which allows Rashid two balls at Babar. Sound the match-up klaxon! I wouldn\u2019t say Babar is Rashid\u2019s bunny, but he has struggled against him at times. Babar works both deliveries into the leg side for two, played with Fairy Liquid hands so that the ball takes longer to get to the fielder. \u201cFollowing the text from a bumpy bus outside Nairobi,\u201d writes Tom Wein. \u201cMy American colleagues were baffled by my protests that this trip clashed with the match. My Indian colleagues, who I normally count on to explain cricket with me, were strangely unwilling to help. Thanks for the coverage!\u201d     8.40am   WICKET! Pakistan 45-2 (Haris c Stokes b Rashid 8)  Adil Rashid strikes with his first ball! Haris charged down the track and launched the ball high towards long on, where Stokes steadied himself to take a simple catch. It\u2019s only Rashid\u2019s third wicket of the tournament, but he has bowled majestically in the last three games (and one ball). Haris\u2019s excitable 12-ball innings comes to an end, and here comes Shan Masood.    Updated at 10.06am GMT    8.37am    7th over: Pakistan 45-1 (Babar 18, Haris 8) Both teams still look pretty nervous. Stokes returns to the attack and rams a bouncer past Haris\u2019s attempted hook. That really zipped through.  Haris makes room to thump the next ball back over Stokes\u2019s head for two. He\u2019s batting very skittishly, but England know that his approach \u2013 and his hitting ability \u2013 make him a dangerous customer. Six from the over.     8.34am    6th over: Pakistan 39-1 (Babar 17, Haris 4) Babar waves a poor ball from Woakes round the corner for four, then mistimes a clip that lands safely on the leg side. Mike Atherton, commentating on Sky, says that the pitch looks a bit two-paced. I think Pakistan would take 150. Haris edges Woakes just short of Salt at backward point and then misses another heave on the run. But he finally gets off the mark from his seventh delivery, scooping Woakes gracefully over short fine leg for four. \u201cSam Curran is one of the mentally strongest sportsfolk it\u2019s ever been my pleasure to watch,\u201d writes my colleague Daniel Harris. \u201cTo deliver something almost all of the time but especially when it\u2019s most required, and without being as good as the best in either discipline - much as he\u2019s improved at T20 bowling - is seriously mindblowing.\u201d What I like about him is that he has both bronca and a very high sporting IQ. The two don\u2019t always go together.  Updated at 8.35am GMT    8.29am    5th over: Pakistan 29-1 (Babar 11, Haris 0) Mohammad Haris, a stylish dasher whose hero is Jos Buttler, comes into at No3. He charges his third ball and misses an almighty wipe. The ball is shorter and slower, and Haris fresh-airs an attempted uppercut. That\u2019s a brilliant over from Curran \u2013 one wicket and just one run. He is now the joint leading wicket-taker among those who started at the Super 12s \u2013 he and Anrich Nortje have 11. Before the tournament, my nephew Aidan kept pointing out that Curran was 200/1 to be player of the tournament. I hope he had a bet on it. \u201cGood evening Rob from a weirdly autumnal Melbourne,\u201d says Patrick O\u2019Brien. Cricket fans here are focusing on their IODs and SAMs as much as their DRS\u2019s. Here\u2019s hoping the skies stay closed.\u201d Right: what\u2019s an IOD, what\u2019s an SAM and what the hell is a weirdly autumnal Melbourne.  Updated at 8.29am GMT    8.25am   WICKET! Pakistan 29-1 (Rizwan b Curran 15)  A huge wicket for England! Rizwan has fallen the ball after receiving treatment. He chased a wide, wobble-seam delivery, angled across from over the wicket, and dragged it back onto the stumps. Sam Curran, England\u2019s bowler of the tournament, has another wicket.    Updated at 8.41am GMT    8.23am    4.1 overs: Pakistan 28-0 (Rizwan 15, Babar 11) Rizwan needs treatment after diving for a single and jamming his right eye against the grille of the helmet. There\u2019s a bit of bruising but he looks fine.     8.22am    4th over: Pakistan 28-0 (Rizwan 15, Babar 10) Only Virat Kohli and Aaron Finch have scored more T20 runs against England than these two. Rizwan adds six to his career total, slog-sweeping Woakes \u2013 yep, slog-sweeping Woakes \u2013 high over square leg. It was a slower ball, but even so: shot! Rizwan, busy as ever, steals a single off the next ball. He is the most infectious, effervescent cricketer, just a pleasure to watch even when he is shattering your partisan dreams. Babar still hasn\u2019t hit a boundary, but he gets three with a slightly mistimed flick over mid-on. I was going to say that if Babar is mistiming it, the pitch can\u2019t be great, but he\u2019s spent most of the tournament failing to locate the middle. The great Osman Samiuddin wrote a terrific piece on it. \u201cWhat\u2019s all this?\u201d says Brendan Large. \u201cThis was not in my plans. I was thinking I could sleep in whilst occasionally checking the OBO for updates on how deep under water the MCG was. Now all my usual nerves have kicked in and I have a sweat on. At least bowling first means England can\u2019t quite lose it in the first half hour, but they could go a long way to winning if they get the openers early doors. Fingers crossed that rain doesn\u2019t play the deciding role here.\u201d    Updated at 8.36am GMT    8.17am    3rd over: Pakistan 16-0 (Rizwan 7, Babar 6) Sam Curran replaces Stokes and beats Babar with his first and fifth deliveries, both angled across him from over the wicket. A good over ends with a big inswinger that hits Babar high on the pad.  For most teams this would be a slow start. Pakistan do things differently.     8.12am    2nd over: Pakistan 12-0 (Rizwan 4, Babar 5) Both teams have started nervously, England in particular, and Chris Woakes\u2019 first ball is a leg-side wide that Babar ignores. There\u2019s a bit of swing for Woakes too, who is pitching the ball up as a result. He hasn\u2019t quite got his line right though, and there are three singles on the leg side.     8.07am    1st over: Pakistan 8-0 (Rizwan 3, Babar 3) The first delivery of the match is a front-foot no-ball from Ben Stokes. Tremendous stuff. It was a good delivery, actually, a full-length outswinger that Rizwan defended, but replays showed he had overstepped. Stokes follows that with a wide, so the free hit rolls over, but he makes the best of a bad job with a nasty lifter that thumps Rizwan on the body. It\u2019s supposed to be a free hit for the batter, not the bowler. There\u2019s definitely some swing from Stokes, so he might get a second over. Rizwan plays tip and run to mid-off and is well short of his ground when Jordan\u2019s throw misses the stumps. England couldn\u2019t have wanted a better fielder to have an early run-out chance. An eventful over concludes with Babar cutting a short ball for three. That\u2019s not the length to bowl, Benjamin. England bowled way too short against Ireland in similar conditions and were punished.   Updated at 8.16am GMT    8.00am    Here come Mohammad Rizwan and Babar Azam, simply the greatest T20 opening partnership of all time. It looks like Ben Stokes will bowl the first over. Let\u2019s get this thing under way.  Updated at 8.02am GMT    7.59am    \u201cMy two sons are sat high up in the MCG on, they say, a lovely evening,\u201d writes Rob Lewis. \u201cJosh is naturally supporting England, but so is Will, who is my Aussie son. Who is the neutral going for in this final? Indians surely for us, but most red-blood Aussies and I suspect others, will go for Pakistan\u2026\u201d Without doubt. I\u2019m an England fan and there\u2019s a big part of my subconscious that wants Pakistan to win.     7.57am    Tense, nervous headache? I\u2019ll say!     7.56am     The last time the MCG hosted a World Cup final (the women\u2019s T20 a couple of years back) Katy Perry was the pre-match entertainment. We\u2019ve got Icehouse. Their UK peak was a No13 hit with Hey Little Girl in 1983.      7.54am    The magic number      7.53am    The players walk onto the field for the national anthems. The atmosphere at the MCG is incredible.   Updated at 8.08am GMT    7.41am    I\u2019m off to grab a coffee. See you in a few minutes for the World Cup bleeding final.     7.39am    \u201cI think Buttler opting to bowl is a shrewd move in a potential 10-over thrash,\u201d says Tom Van der Gucht. \u201cIf the rain materialises, there\u2019s a chance the Pakistan openers would have crawled to 50 for no wicket and would miss out on the opportunity to accelerate through the gears after laying a solid platform. This pressure might also force them to take more risks and abandon their normal game plan too.\u201d Yes, on balance it\u2019s the right decision \u2013 but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s the big advantage that it was in the early days of DLS T20 calculations.     7.38am    \u201cThis is a repeat of an occasion that virtually changed the fate of Pakistan,\u201d says Zain Malik, time-travelling back to 25 March 1993. \u201cA Melbourne final which saw the legend and myth of individual triumph become entrenched in Pakistan\u2019s public memory. In all its glamour, coloured shirts and floodlights, heroes were born defeating the mighty English in a distant land. Pakistan was announced to the world in style.  \u201cThirty years later, Australia is no longer a distant land. Babar is on the billboards and the MCG is expected to become a sea of green with the Barmy Army cowering to find a voice. Whatever happens, it is this beautiful sport that has brought this nation to the world.  \u201cIt is only Pakistan that can conquer the world through clumsy, stumbling, circumstantial luck. You\u2019ve got to love them, for they always give you something to believe in. For inspiring all the forces of nature to come together and deliver them victory. Go on boys, do this for the people.\u201d I would politely disagree with one thing \u2013 when Pakistan conquer the world, it has the square root of bugger all to do with luck. (Well, apart from Netherlands beating South Africa \u2013 I\u2019m referring specifically to Pakistan\u2019s games.)     7.34am    \u201cMy god, it\u2019s happening isn\u2019t it?\u201d writes Guy Hornsby. \u201cNo place I\u2019d rather be than following on this place, amongst fatalists and friends. The thing is, we are evens here, but you worry about early wickets as our middle order really hasn\u2019t fired. Now\u2019s the time I guess! So much on the opening pairs and bowlers here. And my twin brother is sat at the G, just in 6 range at mid off. What a day, Rob.\u201d That\u2019s probably England\u2019s biggest concern, because you have to assume Pakistan\u2019s new-ball bowlers will take a wicket or three. Jos Buttler and Alex Hales have scored 58 per cent of England\u2019s runs in this tournament; the third highest runscorer is Ben Stokes with 58.     7.27am    I can\u2019t quite believe that we are half an hour away from a World Cup final. All the signs were that it would be rained off, or at the very least have a delayed start.  Updated at 7.27am GMT    7.25am   The teams  Pakistan Mohammad Rizwan (wk), Babar Azam (c), Mohammad Haris, Shan Masood, Iftikhar Ahmed, Mohammad Nawaz, Shadab Khan, Mohammad Wasim, Naseem Shah, Haris Rauf, Shaheen Shah Afridi England Buttler (c/wk), Hales, Salt, Stokes, Brook, Ali, Livingstone, Curran, Woakes, Jordan, Rashid.  Updated at 7.27am GMT    7.22am   England win the toss and bowl first  Jos Buttler says the weather is the main reason for fielding first. England are unchanged, though Buttler didn\u2019t specify whether Mark Wood was available for selection or not. There might be echoes of Robin Smith in 1992 \u2013 he missed the semi-final through injury, was available for the final but missed out. Surely England wouldn\u2019t leave Wood out though? It\u2019d be like leaving Robin Smith out of a World Cup final! Babar Azam says Pakistan would also have bowled. And they are also unchanged.  Updated at 7.31am GMT    7.22am    \u201cGood morning Rob from a gloriously autumnal hillside in Piedmont,\u201d says Finbar Anslow. \u201cAgreed, the two teams have nothing in common, except that they\u2019re both captained by ex Somerset players. Thanks for the commentary. Should be a brilliant match.\u201d It should, although we said the same about the series decider between these two last month. A Super Over wouldn\u2019t be a surprise; nor would a thumping victory for either team.     7.16am    The toss Teams usually bowl first when there is rain around, so that they know exactly what they need to chase. But DLS targets are tougher than they used to be, never mind the pressure of batting last in a final. There must at least be a temptation to get runs on the board while conditions are good.     7.11am    Meet the new captain, subtly different to the old captain      7.10am    England will wear black armbands today in tribute to David English, who died yesterday at the age of 76. English was a cricket obsessive whose Bunbury schools festival gave many England greats their first significant exposure.    Updated at 7.29am GMT    7.08am    Pakistan have a few dangermen, none greater than Shaheen Shah Afridi. He\u2019s the best in the world, perhaps the best ever, at taking a wicket in the first over of a T20.      7.05am    Team news Simon Burnton, our man at the MCG, says that Mark Wood has marked out his run-up \u2013 but so has Chris Jordan, so who knows. It sounds like Dawid Malan hasn\u2019t made it. I\u2019d imagine Pakistan will be unchanged; we haven\u2019t heard anything to the contrary.  Updated at 7.07am GMT    7.00am   Preamble  Hello and welcome to live, over-by-over coverage of the World T20 final between England and Pakistan in Melbourne. It\u2019s the best batting line-up in the world against the best bowling attack \u2013 or, to put it another way, the irresistible force versus the irresistible force. It is also \u2013 just imagine the reaction had you pitched this little beauty in March 2015 \u2013 England\u2019s third World Cup final in six years, and a chance to cement their legacy as one of the greatest white-ball sides of all time. No men\u2019s team has been ODI and T20 world champions at the time, not even the great West Indies side of the late 1970s. There\u2019s just one snag: they\u2019re playing Pakistan. Pakistan, whose cornered tigers savaged England so euphorically in the 50-over final on this ground in 1992; Pakistan, who do unto logic as \u2013 get your contemporary references here \u2013 David Brent does unto faxes from head office; Pakistan, who lost their first two games and were 50/1 to win the World Cup eight days ago; Pakistan, whose every ICC tournament victory \u2013 1992, 2009, 2017 \u2013 has involved them having the best view from the precipice throughout; Pakistan, who on their day leave even the strongest opposition wondering what the haal has hit them. That\u2019s the image we have of Pakistan \u2013 although, at the risk of being the pedant at the orgy, it\u2019s a bit more nuanced than that. In their own merculiar (sic) way, they have been the most consistent T20 team of all since the first World Cup in 2007. Nobody has reached as many semi-finals; nobody has played in more finals. The relationship between England and Pakistan has changed \u2013 there\u2019s lot more respect, and nobody\u2019s mother-in-law will be getting a mention tonight. The teams are also far closer in style and mood than they used to be. But they will never have everything in common. Take the opening partnerships. Both are world-class, both have beaten India by 10 wickets at a World T20 in the past 13 months, yet they have different cat-skinning methodologies. It\u2019s England\u2019s cold-hearted bruisers, Jos Buttler and Alex Hales (average partnership 74, strike-rate 158), versus Pakistan\u2019s careful caressers, Babar Azam and Mohammad Rizwan (avge 50, with a much greater sample size; strike-rate 132). Babar and Rizwan\u2019s century stand in the semi-final hammering of New Zealand was their eighth for the first wicket in T20Is. That\u2019s twice as many as anyone else. England\u2019s openers go harder because the teams bats down to No11. Pakistan\u2019s tail starts at No8, and they\u2019ll display it with pride \u2013 because Nos 8-11 are in the team to take wickets, and they can all bowl in excess of 90mph. Buttler and Babar know - as captains and openers, for richer and poorer - that each bowling attack has enviable variety: legspinners, offspinners, right-armers, left-armers. Whoever the batter, there\u2019s a match-up for that. The whole thing is impossibly exciting. Or it would be if we hadn\u2019t spent the last 72 hours looking at weather apps. A World Cup that has been defined by bad weather may yet be decided by it. When I went to bed last night I thought there was no chance to play today, and that I\u2019d be home in time for Dawson\u2019s Creek, but things are looking more promising now. The cold November rain is nowhere to be seen - Melbourne has been unexpectedly dry today, though the forecast is still for heavy showers both tonight and throughout the reserve day tomorrow. We need at least 10 overs a side for the game to be completed. If they can\u2019t manage that by tomorrow evening then England and Pakistan will be joint world champions, and supposedly responsible adults will start using that icky phrase about kissing your sister. The match begins, weather permitting, at 8am in London, 1pm in Karachi and 7pm in Melbourne  Updated at 7.19am GMT "

He should probably do a DNA test while he\u2019s at it. Anyway, there he was, reading L\u2019Equipe like a show-off when he decided to call The Fiver and tell us what he\u2019d learned. - \u201cHello?\u201d- \u201c[Aside] Gar\u00e7on, la bi\u00e8re la moins ch\u00e8re tout de suite. Allez Allez Allez!\u201d- \u201cAh, if it isn\u2019t our continental cousin, the world famous Francophone boy reporter, Tin and more Tin.\u201d He proceeded to tell The Fiver a boring old story heard many times before, expecting us to laugh along with him as he indulged himself. Maybe the DNA test is not necessary, after all. Then again, he did add some amusing details to the tale, courtesy of his well-lubricated research. It was all about Paris Saint-Germain and their Qatari overlords\u2019 attempt to buy respectability. According to figures published by L\u2019Equipe, PSG have the 14 highest paid players in Ligue Urrrn, which makes their 12-point lead at the top of the table about as impressive as Prince Charles\u2019 employment history. PSG\u2019s monthly wage bill is said to be nearly 10 times higher than the Ligue Urrrn average, which makes last weekend\u2019s 3-0 defeat by Monaco, admittedly no lovable urchins themselves, all the more rum. PSG are not, of course, the reigning champions, since they lost the title last season to Lille, who also beat them in the French equivalent of the Charidee Shield. That was before Nice knocked them out of the Coupe de France, and also before they soiled their special Big Cup pants in front of the whole world in Madrid. This, then, has been the most hapless year in the oil-powered existence of the new-fangled PSG. And L\u2019Equipe reckons it will cost them around \u20ac20m to jilt Mauricio Pochettino and his backroom team, who are not even the main problem. Gar\u00e7on la bi\u00e8re la moins ch\u00e8re tout de suite Allez Allez Allez Fiver was right, that really is funny! He really should do that DNA test. LIVE ON BIG WEBSITE Another cl\u00e1sico?

He has drawn criticism this season for how animated he is on the touchline. Guardiola can also be histrionic and was asked whether he might calm his behaviour to avoid a potential flashpoint.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know. Anything can happen on the touchline in the moments of the game,\u201d he said. \u201cHe\u2019s a rival, of course. Tomorrow he wants to beat me and I want to beat him. I know in defeat we are not the best friends in the world. From my point of view I have a huge respect as a person, as a manager. That\u2019s not going to change.\n\u201cIf we\u2019re going to fight on the touchline \u2013 it\u2019s going to happen sooner or later I guess \u2013 it won\u2019t change the respect. I teach him a few things but this comes from himself, his mum and dad, his character and that was already there. Mikel, I know him and I had the feeling during the time we worked together that what he is doing is not fake.\n\u201cSo when we were making a training session and in a game, he was always complaining about referees, and that was as an assistant coach. It is what it is. After that I am not a judge; everyone is everyone and sometimes I behave as well in this way.\u201d\n\nGuardiola believes Arteta is being unfairly scrutinised because Arsenal are the Premier League pace-setters. It was put to him that Liverpool\u2019s J\u00fcrgen Klopp can behave similarly and not be criticised.\n\u201cAbsolutely,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen you are top of the league they have to undermine you for another reason. And they are doing that right now. I know this situation quite well.\u201d\nGuardiola, who has led City to four titles in the past five seasons, is unsure whether Arsenal will be consistent challengers should they be champions. \u201cThe situation changes a lot,\u201d he said. \u201cHow they\u2019re going to react if they win titles. The new players come in, play and the players who win the titles say: \u2018Oh, now I don\u2019t play, I have a new role.\u2019\n\u201cThey have the potential as a club, with the manager, with stable finances, to do it. I didn\u2019t know here [with City], so imagine talking about Arsenal in the future. What I know from my experience is that we are not the same. I am not the same, the players are not the same; everyone changed. Good things and bad things influence our lives.\u201d\nGuardiola revealed when he first realised how passionate Arteta is about Arsenal. \u201cI know he went to his club, the team he dreams of. He\u2019s a supporter, for the fact he played there, he was a captain there. He loves the club. I remember when we were together, when we scored goals he jumps a lot and celebrates except for one team. I jump, look back and he was sitting there. It was at that moment I said: \u2018That guy likes Arsenal.\u2019\u201d\nPhil Foden is a doubt because of a foot injury."

                    "body": "Manchester City host Arsenal on Saturday with the teams level on points, City having played a game more. The chance to take the advantage in the race for Champions League qualification is on the line, with the Gunners third and City outside the UWCL places in fourth. Both clubs will also retain hope of winning the title. City still have to travel to Arsenal in the league and their 1-0 extra-time defeat at Arsenal in the Continental Cup semi-final on Wednesday showed the tightness of the margin between the teams. What did we learn from that encounter, what can we expect on Saturday and what could decide the outcome?  Nullifying City\u2019s wide duo Jonas Eidevall switched to a back three for the first time in his almost 20 months with Arsenal on Wednesday. It proved effective, nullifying the potent England wingers Chloe Kelly and Lauren Hemp, with the wing-backs Katie McCabe and Laura Wienroither dealing with their pair and the centre-backs on hand to cope with dangerous balls in from wide areas. City had 25 shots but only seven on target. What Eidevall will do on Saturday is anyone\u2019s guess. \u201cI don\u2019t know yet what I\u2019m going to do so it\u2019s going to be a good guessing game for them,\u201d he said. Adding a layer of unpredictability diversifies Arsenal\u2019s options. \u201cIt\u2019s important to have two different systems, to make it harder for opponents to prepare for us,\u201d the manager said. \u201cIf we know how we can use it, the opponent will never be sure when we\u2019re going to use one or the other and that of course makes their preparation much harder.\u201d  Arsenal\u2019s goal hunt Arsenal need goals. They had 15 shots with seven on target against City and 21 shots in a goalless draw with West Ham last Sunday. Eidevall\u2019s desire for a proven goalscorer in January after ACL injuries to Beth Mead and Vivianne Miedema was clear but he missed out on adding a player of the calibre required. Now he needs his forwards to step up and make that irrelevant. Sweden\u2019s Stina Blackstenius has not scored in the league since a 4-0 defeat of bottom-placed Leicester on 6 November, though she has hit five goals in cup competitions since. Her winner on Wednesday will hopefully restore some much-needed self-confidence. City have less of a goalscoring problem but drawing a blank against Arsenal in the cup could rattle them. Psychological advantage Arsenal got the better of City in the Conti Cup but the quick turnaround and Arsenal having to travel north perhaps largely nullifies any psychological advantage. \u201cI think it\u2019s one where we dust ourselves down and get ready,\u201d City\u2019s manager, Gareth Taylor, told his club\u2019s website. \u201cWe have to capitalise on them travelling up as well \u2026 I always felt better playing two games in three days. The first game felt like a warm-up and you might not feel good in those days between the games but I think once the whistle blows on Saturday the players will be ready.\u201d Eidevall believes the biggest factor in earning back-to-back wins against City will be recovery. \u201cMostly it\u2019s about what the players do on an individual basis to recover, who\u2019s the best in eating, who\u2019s the best in sleeping, who\u2019s the best taking ice baths,\u201d he said. \u201cYou have to be a world champion in those things on Thursday and Friday \u2013 that\u2019s what\u2019s going to make a big difference on Saturday.\u201d "

However, one particularly tricky question The Fiver can\u2019t help but feel has gone unasked regards the timing of Friday\u2019s draw. Scheduled for 5pm BST, it hasn\u2019t gone unnoticed here in Fiver Towers that world football\u2019s governing body has pointedly timed it to coincide with the arrival of the world\u2019s most daily email in the spam folders of our subscribers, meaning we\u2019re unable to provide any pithy commentary here. What\u2019s more, this deliberate act of spiteful, bureaucratic sabotage means that, in terms of piping-hot takes on high-profile match-ups, it behoves us to scrabble around closer to home. Following a two-week hiatus the Premier League resumes on Saturday, with Liverpool\u2019s game against Watford getting proceedings under way at Anfield. Victory for J\u00fcrgen Klopp\u2019s side would see them leapfrog Manchester City and go top of the table for a couple of hours at least, until Pep Guardiola and his merry men swat Burnley aside at Turf Moor.

Burnley is the last place you want to go.\u201d  For a man who has complained loudly and at great length since his arrival in England any time his team has been forced to play early on a Saturday, Klopp was uncharacteristically upbeat about their kick-off time. \u201cMost of the time City have played before us,\u201d he blurted. \u201cThis time we play before them but I couldn\u2019t care less.\u201d However, he did warn any Liverpool fans with laryngitis to stay away from Anfield. \u201cWe need the best 12.30pm atmosphere ever \u2013 if you cannot shout or sing, then stay at home and give your ticket to somebody else, please.\u201d That\u2019s them told.

FIVER LETTERS \u201cSteven Pye\u2019s article on the Liverpool team of 1984 brought back fond memories for me, as I was a 13-year-old Walsall supporter back then. Shunned by my peers at school for being a fan of a team \u2018no one had heard of\u2019, this was my time to bask in some glory. Alan Buckley worked miracles and assembled a team that pushed the European champions all the way in the Milk Cup semi-final. I listened to both ties on the radio while pretending to do homework, with my dad going to both legs. In spite of the result it was a great time to be a Walsall fan. Good times don\u2019t happen often to us poor souls.

But then, I support Crystal Palace. Maguire\u2019s time at Leicester City coincided with the Foxes losing four consecutive games to Palace for the first time since the 1990s, but the Eagles have not beaten them since Maguire moved to Manchester United. By coincidence, his first game against Palace in a United shirt was also the first time the Eagles had won a league fixture at Old Trafford since 1989.

                    "body": "Historian, philosopher and author Yuval Noah Harari was born in Israel in 1976 and completed his PhD at Jesus College, Oxford, in 2002. In 2014 he published Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind, which went on to become an international bestseller. It was followed by Homo Deus: A Brief History of Tomorrow (2016) and 21 Lessons for the 21st Century (2018). He lives in Israel with his husband and works as a history professor at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. On 2 June Harari will be attending HowTheLightGetsIn Hay remotely; you can catch him in conversation with Slavoj \u017di\u017eek.   1. Fiction The Women of Troy by Pat Barker I really liked this book, which retells part of the story of the Trojan war and the Iliad from the viewpoint of the captive women. It was interesting to see how you can tell one of the most repeated stories, certainly in the western tradition, in a completely new way, just by adopting a new perspective. Pat Barker writes wonderfully \u2013 I\u2019ve read most of her books. When she describes something, it feels sensory and concrete. You can imagine clearly what she\u2019s talking about. I couldn\u2019t put it down. 2. Musical The Book of Mormon  This was the last musical I saw before the coronavirus pandemic made it problematic to come to London and see them. I actually saw it four times on different occasions \u2013 it\u2019s an amazing performance. I really connected with it: the whole musical is about the power of stories to shape the world and how a completely fictional story can impose itself on reality, for better or worse, and people\u2019s entire lives and the social and political systems all get reshaped.   3. Nonfiction Different: What Apes Can Teach Us About Gender by Frans de Waal I\u2019m reading this now. This was a safe bet for me, because every time Frans de Waal publishes a book I immediately read it, ever since Chimpanzee Politics, which came out 40 years ago and blew my mind. The new book is very timely and courageous in how he tackles some of the hottest topics of today \u2013 it goes right to the issue of sex and gender in biology and culture. I also really like his writing style: he is able to popularise scientific ideas in such a clear and engaging way. 4. TV Young Royals (Netflix)  This series is about what happens when the crown prince of Sweden turns out to be gay. Fiction is at its best when it\u2019s like a social experiment. Royal houses are built on the most traditional views of family, heredity, sexuality and gender. The first season didn\u2019t take the experiment far \u2013 the royal family just shut the prince in the closet. I hope the second season breaks new ground and explores how a liberal royal institution might publicly embrace a gay crown prince: \u201cYeah, the prince is gay \u2013 get over it. So let\u2019s think what it means in terms of royal marriages, succession and all that.\u201d 5. Place Alpe Adria Trail, Slovenia  Last year I did this trail from Kranjska Gora to Tolmin, and it was one of the most beautiful treks I\u2019ve ever done. It was also interesting from a historical perspective because it runs roughly along the frontline of the first world war, between Italy and the Habsburg empire. It\u2019s mind boggling to realise that hundreds of thousands of people died and were wounded there. When we think about the first world war, we usually think about northern France and the mud of Flanders. Walking between these peaceful forests and the So\u010da river and trying to think how it looked a century ago was quite surreal. 6. Sport 2022 Fifa World Cup  I\u2019m really looking forward to this. It\u2019s a shame that it\u2019s in November and December because I\u2019m planning to go to my yearly meditation retreat in December, so I\u2019ll miss the final and semi-final. I enjoy the football World Cup both because I like the game and also because I think it\u2019s an amazing example, for humanity, of how you can reconcile nationalism with global cooperation. People have fierce loyalty to their national team, but you can\u2019t have a cup unless everybody agrees on the same rules. As a blueprint for the world, I think that\u2019s a good example."

Jonathan Wilson reports from the Al Thumama Stadium.   Updated at 6.23pm GMT    6.13pm    Group A: The Netherlands join Ecuador on top of Group A, with three points each after both nations won their opening games 2-0.      6.04pm   Full time: Senegal 0-2 Netherlands  The Netherlands take the points. They left it late but ultimately Louis van Gaal\u2019s side got the job done against opposition that had a couple of chances but ultimately created very little. Cody Gakpo opened the scoring in the 84th minute with a brave header at the end of a brilliantly timed run. On as a substitute, Davy Klaassen put the game beyond doubt deep in injury time by capitalising on an error from Senegal goalkeeper Edouard Mendy.      6.00pm   GOAL! Senegal  0-2 Netherlands (Klaassen 90+9)  Klaassen makes sure! A shot from Depay is parried into the path of Klaassen by Edouard Mendy and the substitute rifles home on the follow-up. Mendy, who was at fault for the first goal, definitely should have done better there.   Updated at 6.03pm GMT    5.58pm    90+7 min: Depay tries to keep the ball down in the corner but Senegal win it back and try to addvance upfield. They win a free-kick deep inside their own half with only seconds remaining but give the ball away.      5.57pm    90+5 min: Papy Mendy is booked for something or other. Apologies, I didn\u2019t see what.      5.56pm    90+4 min: Netherlands substitution: Marten De Roon on for goalscorer Cody Gakpo.      5.55pm    90+3 min: Koulibally plays the ball wide to Youssef Sabally, who sends an excellent cross towards the far post. Bamba Dieng\u2019s poor header loops high and wide. An excellent chance goes begging.  Updated at 5.56pm GMT    5.51pm    90 min: We\u2019ll have eight minutes of added time, which seems rather a lot all things considered.      5.50pm    88 min: Back to that Dutch goal, which was well taken by Gakpo, who showed courage in leaping for the header knowing that he was almost certain to get clattered from behind by the advancing Edouard Mendy. The cross from Frenkie De Jong was sublime, it should also be noted.      5.48pm    86 min: Netherlands goalkeeper Andries Noppert stretches every inch of his lanky frame to get a strong left hand on a Papa Gueye shot from didstance that looked to be sneaking into the bottom corner. Good save.      5.46pm   GOAL! Senegal 0-1 Netherlands (Gakpo 84)  Netherlands lead! A brilliantly timed run sees Cody Gakpo get in behind the Senegal defence to connect with a De Jong cross and steer a glancing header past the onrushing Edouard Mendy from the edge of the six-yard box.    Updated at 5.53pm GMT    5.43pm    80 min: A second half that started badly has gone progressively downhill. It\u2019s incredibly scrappy. A hopeful cross into the Netherlands box sees Ismaila Sarr get his head to the ball but he\u2019s unable to steer it on target. He protests to referee Wilton Sampaio that he was being held by Nathan Ake and while he definitely has a case, no more is made of it.  Updated at 5.43pm GMT    5.41pm    78 min: Netherlands double-substitution: Davy Klaassen and Teun Koopmeiners on for Stevens Berghuis and Bergwijn.      5.39pm    77 min: The stadium attendance is announced as 41,721, which is 1,721 over capacity. Meanwhile back in reality, it is nothing like full and hasn\u2019t been at any point during the game.      5.36pm    75 min: Senegal double-substitution: Nicolas Jackson and Papa Gueye on for Krepin Diatta and Cheikou Kouyate.      5.34pm    74 min: Save! Noppert saves well from Idrissa Gueye, who made his job easier by shooting straight at him when the goal was looked to be at his mercy.      5.32pm    70 min: Cheikou Kouayate is lying flat on his back with his hands behind his head after doing himself a mischief and is about to leave the field on a stretcher. He seems to have either pulled his hamstring while jumping for a high ball or jarred his knee as a result of landing awkwardly.      5.30pm    69 min: Senegal substitution: Boulaye Dia makes way for Marseille\u2019s Bamba Dieng, who received a long, long touchline pep-talk from his manager Aliou Cisse as he waited to come on.      5.26pm    66 min: Boulaye Diaye shoots on the turn from a tight angle, forcing Andres Noppert to save for the Netherlands at his near post. I think that\u2019s the would be copper\u2019s first save of the game.  Updated at 5.28pm GMT    5.25pm    64 min: Senegal break upfield with Diatta on the ball. He\u2019s forced backwords and picks out Sabally on his inside. The return pass is put out for a throw-in courtesy of a leaden touch from Diatta. This second half is being played at a quite pedestrian pace. \u201cIt\u2019s bang average at best,\u201d says Ally McCoist on ITV co-comms.      5.23pm    62 min: Netherlands substitution: Memphis Depay comes on for Vincent Janssen. Senegal substitution: Ismail Jakobs on for Abdou Diallo.   Updated at 5.42pm GMT    5.21pm    60 min: Netherlands win a corner. It can\u2019t be taken until Senegal defender Abdou Diallo can receive treatment for an injury. Gakpo sends the ball into the mixer, where it\u2019s punched clear by Edouard Mendy.      5.19pm    59 min: Krepin Diatta stretches every sinew but is unable to steer a cross from the right goalwards at the far post under pressure from Virgil van Dijk.      5.18pm    57 min: Matthijs De Ligt gets booked for crashing through the back of Ismaila Sarr. I suspect the Dutch defender may be hauled off sooner rather than later now that he\u2019s walking the proverbial disciplinary tightrope while being given the run-around by his man.      5.16pm    56 min: Gakpo does well to get a cross in from the byline under pressure but Senegal clear.      5.15pm    55 min: Senegal right-back Youssef Sabaly runs on to a loose ball about 10 yards outside the Dutch penalty area, advances and unleashes a shot. It\u2019s blocked by Nathan Ake.      5.13pm    53 min: Gakpo wins and takes a corner. Virgil van Dijk leaps highest, gets a free header and sends the ball over the bar. He should have scored. Or at least hit the target.      5.13pm    52 min: Koulibaly flattens Steven Bergwijn with a reducer from behind but avoids a booking. Bergwijn gets to his feet and blows his cheeks in frustration. I think that really hurt but he doesn\u2019t want to show it.      5.11pm    50 min: Cody Gakpo advances up the right touchline, beating Sabaly en route. He plays the ball inside to Dumfries, who wins a corner for the Netherlands. The ball is sent into the penalty area from the quadrant and Edouard Mendy comes off his line to leap and claim confidently in a thicket of bodies.      5.08pm    47 min: Another loose pass from Frenkie De Jong allows Boulaye Dia to snatch possession for Senegal and sprint upfield. He runs into traffic and De Jong\u2019s blushes are spared. He\u2019s given the ball away on several occasions this evening.   Updated at 5.15pm GMT    5.07pm    46 min: Vincent Janssen goes to ground holding the back of his head after a collision with Cheikou Kouyate, who launched into the back of him in mid-air and possibly should have got a yellow card for his troubles.      5.06pm   Second half: Senegal 0-0 Netherlands  46 min: Senegal get the second half under way with no changes in personnel on either side. Seconds later, Kalidou Koulibaly lumps the ball forward and out for a throw-in.      4.51pm   Half-time: Senegal 0-0 Netherlands  Peep! A reasonably absorbing first half between two decent sides finishes scoreless. The Netherlands have looked more threatening but in Ismaila Sarr, Senegal have had the most dangerous player on the pitch. He\u2019s giving Matthijs De Ligt a very torrid time of it and his team-mates need to get him on the ball more.   Updated at 4.59pm GMT    4.48pm    44 min: It\u2019s been a decent game so far but neither goalkeeper has been tested. Two years ago, in case your interested, the Dutch goalkeeper Andries Noppert was without a club, unemployed and seriously considering giving up football to join the Dutch police force. His opposite number, Edouard Mendy also had a well-documented spell in the footballing wilderness and was unemployed and on the dole as recently as 2016.      4.44pm    42 min: Senegal win a free-kick in line with the front edge of the Netherland\u2019s penalty area. Idrissa Gueye\u2019s attempted cross is woeful and fails to clear the first defender.      4.43pm    41 min: Ismaila Sarr squartes the ball across the Netherlands penalty area and it\u2019s hooked clear by Nathan Ake.   Updated at 4.52pm GMT    4.42pm    40 min: On the edge of the Senegal penalty area, Steven Berghuis runs on to a lay-off from Vincent Janssen and blasts the ball high over the bar.      4.41pm    38 min: Ismaila Sarr races to collect a long Ciss ball from deep out by the touchline under pressure from Matthijs De Ligt. He\u2019s looked dangerous on the rare occasionms he\u2019s got on the ball.      4.38pm    36 min: Netherlands corner after a rising De Jong shot from distance goes out off the head of Pape Abou Cisse. Nothing comes of it.      4.37pm    34 min: Bergwijn plays the ball wide to Blind, whose cross from the left drops for Dumfries in the Senegal penalty area. He\u2019s unable to get a shot away.      4.34pm    31 min: The Netherlands win a free-kick in another promising position for a Cisse foul on Janssen. It\u2019s almost in line with the right edge of the Senegal penalty area. Cody Bakpo hoists the ball towards the far post, where it\u2019s cleared.      4.32pm    30 min: Virgil van Dijk and Frenkie De Jong get their wires crossed, with the latter failing to collect a pass from the other after turning his back to him. Idrissa Gueye pounces but sends a rushed shot wide.      4.30pm    28 min: Idrissa Gueye and Cheik Kouyate combine down the right flank for Senegal but are unable to find a way through the Dutch rearguard.      4.29pm    26 min: An attempted Dumfries cross goes out for a corner off Abdou Diallo, the Senegal left-back. VIrgil van Dijk heads the ensuing outswinger well wide then castigates himself in the strongest terms possible as he returns to his position.   Updated at 4.40pm GMT    4.27pm    25 min: With just over a quarter of the game gone, there\u2019s little to choose between the two teams. The Netherlands are edging it but are made to sweat even more after Ismaila Sarr cuts inside from the left with a drop of the shoulder and curls a shot goalwards. Virgil van Dijk heads the ball clear.      4.26pm    23 min: The stadium seems to have filled up considerably since kick-off, in a state of affairs that suggests the fans here may have suffered the same ticketing app issues that befell England and Iran fans before their game earlier today.      4.24pm    21 min: Netherlands free-kick, a couple of yards outside the Senegal penalty area, in line with the right edge. Berghuis\u2019s curled delivery isn\u2019t great and Senegal clear comfortably.      4.22pm    19 min: A brilliant ball inside from Bergwijn picks out Steven Berghuis. He squares it for Frenkie De Jong, who somehow contrives not to get a shot off despite appearing to have all the time in the world. He twists and turns, allowing Senegal\u2019s defence to regroup and crowd him off the ball.      4.19pm    16 min: Daley Blind leaps higher than Youssef Sabaly at the far post to connect with a Cody Gakpo cross. His downward header bounces the wrong side of the upright.      4.18pm    14 min: Gakpo and Dumfries combine down the inside-right but the latter\u2019s pull-basck goes straight to a Senegalese defender.      4.15pm     11 min: After just 10 minutes, the players of both sides are both drenched with sweat. Senegal attack, but Krepin Diatta loses the ball on the back of a heavy touch before he can get a cross in from the right.  Updated at 4.19pm GMT    4.12pm    10 min: Denzel Dumfries picks up the ball on the right touchline and curls a cross into the Senegal penalty area. Edouard Mendy claims confidently at the far post.      4.11pm    9 min: Ismaila Sarr shoots on the turn from distance after receiving a pass through the middle with his back towards goal. His effort sails high over the bar.      4.10pm    7 min: Early errors at both end in an open game but no goals or chances of note just yet. Senegal attack down the right and a cross is hoisted towards the far post. Showing all the agility of a centre-half his size, Pape Abou Cisse is unable to connect with the dropping ball to steer it goalwards from a tight angle.      4.08pm    3 min: After that shaky start, the Netherlands advance and should have taken the lead. Steven Bergwijn is unable to get on the end of a low Cody Gakpo cross into the Senegal penalty area after Edouard Mendy had rushed off his line and been caught in no-man\u2019s land.      4.05pm    1 min: The Netherlands pass the ball around the back and try to advance until Matthijs De Ligt gives the ball away. Ismaila Sarr pounces and pulls the ball back towards Boulaye Dia, whose shot is blocked by Frenkie De Jong. The ball goes out for a corner, from which nothing comes.      4.02pm   Senegal v Netherlands is go ...  1 min: Following Ecuador\u2019s win over Qatar last night, the second Group A match of the tournament gets under way with the Dutch getting the ball rolling. The players of the Netherlands wear orange shirts, shorts and socks. The African champions are in white shirts, white shorts and white socks.   Updated at 4.08pm GMT    3.56pm    Out they go: Both sets of players walk out on to the pitch and stand either side of referee Wilton Sampaio and his team of match officials for the national anthems.      3.55pm    Not long now: The teams are in the tunnel awaiting the end of an extravagant light and pyrotechnics show at a currently half-full (at best) Al-Thumama Stadium before marching out on to the pitch. Here\u2019s hoping for a cracking, competitive game. It\u2019s the third of the tournament and the two that have preceded it have both been ridiculously one-sided affairs.   Updated at 4.04pm GMT    3.37pm    Those teams: The Netherlands name uncapped goalkeeper Andries Noppert in their starting line-up, while Senegal have picked Krepin Diatta as their replacement for Sadio Mane. Senegal have nine players from their Africa Cup of Nations winning squad in their starting line-up. After much speculation over the identity of the Dutch keeper coach Louis van Gaal chose Noppert, who at 6ft 8in is the tallest player at this World Cup, despite the fact he has yet to play an international. Denzel Dumfries starts at right-wing back for the Netherlands, despite his participation being in doubt in the build-up to the game.      3.23pm   Senegal v Netherlands line-ups  Senegal (4-3-3): Edouard Mendy, Koulibaly, Cisse, Gueye, Papy Mendy, Kouyate, Dia, Diatta, Sarr, Sabaly, Diallo. Netherlands (3-4-1-2): Noppert, De Ligt, Van Dijk, Ake, Bergwijn, Gakpo, Berghuis, Blind, Janssen, De Jong, Dumfries.     2.36pm    The Netherlands: \u201cLouis van Gaal believes the Netherlands can win the World Cup because his squad has a \u201chigher average quality\u201d than the group he led to third at Brazil 2014,\u201d writes Jamie Jackson from Doha.      2.32pm    Senegal without Sadio: The injury to the Bayern Munich forward is a blow, but the African champions have a pragmatic approach to tournament football under Aliou Ciss\u00e9, writes Ed Aarons.      2.31pm    Today\u2019s match officials  Referee: Wilton Sampaio (Brazil) Assistant referees: Bruno Boschilia (Brazil) and Bruno Pires (Brazil) Video Assistant Referee: Juan Soto (Venezuala)       2.31pm   Early team news  As mentioned previously, Senegal are without Sadio Mane, who could be reaplced by Monaco winger Krepin Diatta. Abou Diallo, the RB Leipzig central defender, could miss out with a knee injury. The Netherlands are also missing a key player, with Memphis Depay sidelined for this match at the very least with a hamstring injury. Denzel Dumfries could also miss out after suffering an injury while playing for Inter last weekend, while the participation of midfielder Marten De Roon is also in doubt.   Updated at 3.36pm GMT    2.30pm   Group A: Senegal v Netherlands  Qatar\u2019s 40,000-capacity Al-Thumama Stadium is the venue for today\u2019s encounter between Senegal and the Netherlands. Slated to host eight different matches in this tournament, it hosted it\u2019s first game thirteen months ago. The African champions suffered a pre-tournament hammerblow with the news that their star player Sadio Mane had been ruled out for the duration after suffering an injury while playing for Bayern Munich that sent his international manager Aliou Cisse back to the drawing board.  The Netherlands come into this tournament having qualified as group winners under Louis van Gaal and have since won five out of six Nations League matches, drawing the other. Kick-off in this tantalising match pitting Africa\u2019s best against one of Europe\u2019s finest is at 4pm (GMT) but stay tuned in the meantime for team news and build-up.   "

                    "body": "  10.41am    And here\u2019s Emma Kemp\u2019s full match report:      10.19am   Final thoughts  Well, they say it\u2019s is a game of two halves, don\u2019t they? The first 45 minutes on the Central Coast were as unconvincing as they come \u2013 a far cry from where the Matildas want to be so close to the World Cup. But after the break, and buoyed by two early Hayley Raso goals, it was a different game. Four-nil may flatter the hosts somewhat, but what should not be overlooked is the fact that Tony Gustavsson\u2019s side were able to breach a very stubborn defence four times. That\u2019s no mean feat. Other ticks for Gustavsson were Clare Hunt\u2019s debut, Raso\u2019s brace-and-an-assist performance, Clare Polkinghorne\u2019s longevity and Sam Kerr\u2019s deadly eye for goal, despite not enjoying her best game ever \u2013 as long as she\u2019s scoring, Gustavsson must be happy. Even Mary Fowler was much improved in the second half after a quiet opening 45. But Gustavsson will have to work on the deficiencies of that first half before Sunday\u2019s game against Spain. The world No 7 side will not be as forgiving as the Czechs. And with that thought, I\u2019ll bid you adieu. Emma Kemp\u2019s match report is in the pipeline, so stay tuned for that. Otherwise, until Sunday.  Updated at 10.34am GMT    10.08am    Katrina Gorry is speaking on the telly:  \u201cIt\u2019s massive. Great start to 2023 campaign. I thought we were flat in the first half so nice to see we picked it up in the second half.\u201d     10.05am   Full-time: Australia 4-0 Czech Republic  90+6 mins: There it is! After another brief break as Necidova recovers from a head knock, it\u2019s all over on the Central Coast! A comfortable looking scoreline in the end after the Matildas burst into life after struggling to break down a tough Czech defence in the first half.     10.03am    90+2 mins: Raso! Close to a hat-trick but her shot is straight at Lukasova, who is able to make the save!      10.01am    90+1 mins: The official attendance is 7,702 in Central Coast Stadium tonight. You\u2019d hope there\u2019ll be more turning out in Parramatta on Sunday for the Spain game.  Updated at 10.02am GMT    10.00am    90 mins: Four minutes of added time to be played.      9.59am    89 mins: Raso still looks hungry as the Matildas seek number five. Kerr plays the Man City player through but there\u2019s nothing doing this time, despite Raso\u2019s willingness to keep running.      9.57am    87 mins: Let\u2019s not forget that Australia have put four past a defence that has been miserly at best in recent times. England couldn\u2019t get one past them. Nor could the US. Worth bearing in mind perhaps when assessing how tonight has gone.      9.56am    86 mins: No one would begrudge Polkinghorne that one. What a night for her. And also for Raso, who gets an assist to go with her two goals. Two more changes for the Czech Republic as time ticks towards full-time.     9.55am   Goal! Australia 4-0 Czech Republic (Polkinghorne 84)  84 mins: What a way to mark her record-breaking appearance! Tonight\u2019s captain turns home from close range after Raso\u2019s flick on from the corner!      9.54am    82 mins: Lovely stuff from Cooney-Cross. She looks like she\u2019s lost the ball but she doesn\u2019t give up and slides in to win it back. She follows up that tenacity with a great ball forward for Kerr\u2026 who wins a corner.     9.52am    81 mins: A lovely reverse pass opens up the Matildas defence, but nothing comes of it as the home defence mops up the danger.     9.50am    79 mins: There\u2019ll be another break in play now after Raso upends Czech captain Bertholdova. It\u2019s been a highly physical game, to be fair.     9.46am    76 mins: Another Czech change \u2013 Pochmanova is replaced by Cvrckova. Moments later Raso is bundled over in the box, but the ref\u2019s not having any of it.      9.46am    74 mins: Chidiac made an immediate impact there, and so too does Larissa Crummer, nearly. Cooney-Cross plays her in but she can\u2019t quite get the ball from under her feet and her shot loops up and wide.  https://twitter.com/Evan_M_G/status/1626155174220947458     9.42am   Goal! Australia 3-0 Czech Republic (Kerr 71)  71 mins: Kerr, who else, makes it three for Australia! It\u2019s a simple enough finish for her in the end, after substitute Chidiac sees her effort repelled by Lukasova, only to see it fall to one of most deadly striker\u2019s in the world! She doesn\u2019t make any mistake from close range and the Matildas have a very comfortable lead.     9.40am    68 mins: Substitutions galore, three for each side. The Matildas bring on Chidiac, Crummer and Van Egmond on, as Gorry, Fowler and Vine go off. For the Czechs, Martinkova and Chlastakova are off, I\u2019ll tell you who they\u2019ve come on for in a tick because\u2026.     9.37am    64 mins: A brief break ensues, but we\u2019re back under way soon enough. Gorry slashes another long-range effort over the bar.      9.34am    62 mins: Kerr accidentally stands on Necidova\u2019s hand, but the Matildas still want to break with the ball, despite the prone Czech player. Eventually they pull up so Necidova can get some treatment.     9.31am    61 mins: Raso is such a dynamo. She\u2019ll never sit back, thinking her job is done. Here she is now, chasing back and putting in an important challenge to stymy a Czech attack.      9.30am    60 mins: An hour on the clock, and the pressure has eased on the Matildas, courtesy of Hayley Raso\u2019s quickfire double. They needed that, to be honest.     9.27am    58 mins: The scoreline has a much better look to it now, and the Matildas are brimming with confidence. In particular, Raso, who again gets involved, this time pulling down a long ball before sending over a cross that Kerr leaps salmon-like to get to, but is inches away from making a connection. That could easily have been a third!     9.26am   Goal! Australia 2-0 Czech Republic (Raso 56)  56 mins: Raso again! Catley\u2019s corner goes to the back stick where Hunt nods back across the face of goal for Raso to head home from close range!     9.24am    54 mins: Here\u2019s Fowler, already looking a bit brighter than the first half. She has some time and space to advance, before she drags the ball onto her right foot and lets fly. Deflected behind for another Matildas\u2019 corner\u2026  Updated at 9.25am GMT    9.22am    52 mins: That\u2019s a delicious ball into the box from Cahynova on the Czech right. It\u2019s a matter of inches from the head of Martinkova \u2013 a scare for the Matildas\u2019 defence.     9.21am    51 mins: The Matildas started the first half strongly too, the glaring difference is Raso\u2019s goal. It will be interesting to see where they go from here.      9.20am    50 mins: Vine now looks to make it two after Slajsova fails to head clear. It\u2019s hacked behind for a corner, the first of the half.     9.20am    49 mins: Well, there was an element of fortune about that goal in the end, but Raso did well to actually get into a shooting position, after Kerr\u2019s final pass was slightly behind her.      9.19am   Goal! Australia 1-0 Czech Republic (Raso 48)  48 mins: Fowler is involved before she plays it to Kerr, who in turn lays it off for the overlapping Raso. Her shot is deflected, wrongfooting Lukasova and going in off the near post! The Matildas lead!      9.17am    47 mins: Australia on the front foot immediately as Raso dances into the box but she\u2019s muscled off the ball by Dlaskova and the ball runs out for a goal kick.      9.16am   Second half under way  46 mins: Here we go then. Second half is under way. One change to tell you about \u2013 Clare Hunt is on in place of Aivi Luik to make her debut.  Updated at 9.35am GMT    9.03am    It\u2019s been a frustrating opening 45 minutes for Australia, who surely would have expected to create more chances. But they\u2019ve been largely stifled by a dogged Czech performance. Mary Fowler has been unusually quiet, and Kerr has been left to feed off scraps. The visitors could even be ahead at the break, if not for some alert goalkeeping from MacKenzie Arnold. Gustavsson has a job on his hands in the dressing rooms at the break. Don\u2019t go anywhere.     9.00am   Half-time: Australia 0-0 Czech Republic  45 mins: Bertholdova heads clear \u2013 no surprises there \u2013 and that will be that for the first half.     8.59am    44 mins: What can the Matildas do here, just before half-time? Fowler wins a free-kick \u2013 blown for with the ball just landing at Kerr\u2019s feet in a good position, weirdly \u2013 and the hosts will have a final chance to find a way through this half.     8.57am    42 mins: Catley\u2019s corner is headed clear again. Cooney-Cross recycles it and lobs another ball into the box. Again cleared. Australia aren\u2019t having any joy so far.      8.56am    41 mins: The sky has gone a beautiful pink as the sun sets and Cooney-Cross win another corner for Australia after a neat lay off from Kerr.  Updated at 8.56am GMT    8.55am    40 mins: Nothing comes of the corner but Polkinghorne, of all people, picks up the cleared ball and sends over a lovely cross towards Kerr at the near post. Excitement builds in the crowd, but Lukasova is there first.      8.53am    39 mins: The Matildas can\u2019t seem to get away from those pesky red shirts at the moment. Here goes Kerr, running onto a ball into the box, but again she\u2019s met with a Czech challenge. Corner ball.      8.52am    38 mins: Ooh! Half the stadium think that\u2019s gone in from Raso! But her back-post header hits the side-netting. Great work from Catley on the left with a deep cross there.     8.50am    36 mins: It goes to the near post, where Polkinghorne is making her run. But there\u2019s nothing doing again as the Czechs clear their lines once again.     8.49am    35 mins: A promising move down the right flank ends with a third corner of the night for the Matildas. Catley comes across to take it\u2026     8.48am    34 mins: Ah, that\u2019s nice. The TV camera pans from Kerr to a young boy in the crowd who\u2019s holding up a sign that says \u201cYou inspire me Sam\u201d.   Updated at 9.09am GMT    8.47am    32 mins: Arnold again called into action! This time it\u2019s a fiercely-struck effort towards the near post by Khyrova that needs dealing with. Arnold does so with aplomb. But a few mistakes are creeping into the Matildas play now, and their guests are beginning to capitalise and cause a few problems.     8.45am    30 mins: Oof! Catley gets the ball full in her face. She\u2019s a tough cookie though, and barely flinches. She\u2019s good to go.     8.44am    29 mins: Oooh! Clearest chance of the game so far! Chlastakova runs onto Mrazova\u2019s headed flick-on from a goal kick but she can\u2019t get the ball past the advancing Arnold, who make a good stop. That was proper route one stuff, and the Matildas didn\u2019t cope with it well.     8.42am    28 mins: Fowler\u2019s pulled up for a foul and the Czech Republic have a chance to get another ball into the box. It\u2019s a decent delivery, but Kerr of all people is there to head away.   Updated at 9.08am GMT    8.41am    26 mins: Arnold is called into meaningful action for the first time tonight, springing to her right to turn Dlaskova\u2019s well-struck shot from outside the box around the post for a corner!  Updated at 9.06am GMT    8.39am    24 mins: Kerr does brilliantly to fashion a chance, bursting away from the Czech defence before skipping inside another challenge and slipping the ball to Raso. Raso has Vine screaming for it outside, but her right-footed ball is played too near the keeper and Lukasova claims with ease in the end. A real chance that one.       8.37am    23 mins: Catley slings in the corner, in-swinging towards the head of Polkinghorne, but it\u2019s cleared by a Czech head.     8.36am    22 mins: Over to the other side of the pitch, and the Matildas make progress with a series of throw-ins. Vine is heavily involved over there, and she eventually wins a corner.      8.34am    20 mins: Oh it\u2019s a poor one from Gorry, who sensed she could catch out Lukasova at her near post with a cheeky effort on goal. But her effort finds only Slajsova, who clears and the chance goes begging.     8.33am    19 mins: The pressure is building. Raso goes down right on the edge of the box as she cuts inside only to be felled by Slajsova. Free-kick to Australia, yellow card to Slajsova. Gorry\u2019s over and there could be danger here.     8.32am    17 mins: Here we go though! Cooney-Cross\u2019 long ball forward finds Kerr\u2019s run, but the Chelsea striker\u2019s first touch is not ideal and keeper Lukasova is able to hoon off her line and claim the ball.     8.30am    15 mins: Gorry is in the middle of things at the moment, throwing herself about a bit, but a quarter of an hour in, the Matildas have not been able to break down the Czech defence.     8.28am    13 mins: And now the visitors have a chance to get a ball into the box, with a free-kick of their own. It\u2019s also cleared without too much fuss, and Vine has a chance to break forward. A last-ditch sliding tackle from Dlaskova ensures the excitement in the crowd is extinguished.      8.26am    11 mins: It\u2019s headed clear by the Czech defence and Australia will have to wait for their first clear-cut sight of goal tonight.     8.24am    10 mins: Oops. Grant gets caught dawdling on the ball, but she\u2019s saved by the referee\u2019s whistle, and Catley will pump the ball into the box from the free-kick.      8.22am    9 mins: Cooney-Cross storms through the Czech defence before she looks to play a neat one-two with Kerr, but the return ball is poorly angled and the ball runs through to Czech keeper Lukasova.     8.22am    8 mins: Not sure of the crowd figures yet, of course, but it doesn\u2019t look like an amazing turnout in Gosford. Certainly far from a sell out.      8.20am    6 mins: Another shooting chance arrives after good work from Vine on the right\u2026 the ball is played inside to Cooney-Cross, but again Australia lack a finishing touch and her effort balloons way over the bar.      8.18am    4 mins: Plenty of the ball for record-maker Polkinghorne early on as Australia continue to play it around and keep possession in these opening exchanges.      8.17am    3 mins: The Czechs get the ball for the first time, and Martinkova looks to release a runner down the inside left channel. It\u2019s overhit though. Australia break down to the other end with Catley on the left. Her ball is laid off by Kerr and Gorry fancies her chances with a long-range shot. Way over the bar.     8.15am    2 mins: If I hear the phrase \u201cdress rehearsal\u201d one more time, honestly. Talk about an a la mode buzzword today. Fowler draws a foul and the Matildas keep possession and play it about the back early on.  Updated at 8.16am GMT    8.14am   First half under way  1 min: Here we go then! Australia kick off and we\u2019re off!      8.13am    Not so fast \u2013 let\u2019s have a coin toss and exchange of pennants first.      8.10am    Well done, well done. The anthems are done and dusted and we\u2019re just about ready to get this game under way!   Updated at 8.21am GMT    8.06am    It\u2019s the Welcome to Country first. Beautifully delivered by Uncle Gavi Duncan.     8.04am    The sun is on its way down at this picturesque stadium on the Central Coast and parts of the crowd are bathed in a beautiful golden glow. Here come the teams. The Czechs are in their traditional red shirts and blue shorts, Australia in their usual green and gold. Kick-off is approaching, but we\u2019ll have the anthems first. Petra Bertholdova is the Czech captain, Polkinghorne wears the Australian armband for her milestone appearance.  Updated at 8.04am GMT    7.59am   Spain 3-0 Jamaica  This is of course a double header on the Central Coast today. Earlier the world No 7 side Spain posted a convincing win over Jamaica ahead of their meeting with the Matildas on Sunday in Sydney. Maite Oroz opened the scoring for Spain after a deflected shot rebounded off the bar into her path, before Esther Gonzalez made it two before the break with a neat run and finish. Fiamma Benitez came off the bench to round off the win with a peach into the top right hand corner in the second half.   Updated at 9.13am GMT    7.52am    Here\u2019s Tony G with some smooth talk ahead of kick-off.       7.50am    While we\u2019re awaiting kick-off in Gosford, in about 20 minutes, here\u2019s my colleague Emma Kemp with some thoughts on the Cup of Nations, dress rehearsals and Mary Poppins:      7.48am    Polks is talking to Channel 10 of her pride at breaking the appearance record tonight \u2013 to be clear, that includes men\u2019s as well as women\u2019s football. She\u2019s asked how she avoids ageing, Benjamin Button-style. \u201cI feel like I am. I love what I do and playing in this team so it keeps me younger.  \u201cWe\u2019ve always said this is going to be a rehearsal for the World Cup. It\u2019s going to be a good part of our preparation.\u201d     7.42am    Good to see Mary Fowler in the starting XI tonight \u2013 she\u2019s such a bright talent and always great to watch. The Manchester City player was labelled as The Next Big Thing\u2122 not so long ago on these very pages. Have a read below:      7.40am   Team news  Let\u2019s dive straight in \u2013 there has been some speculation over whether Sam Kerr would play tonight, but fear not, the talismanic striker is on Australia\u2019s starting XI. So too is Clare Polkinghorne, who sets an incredible new record tonight as she becomes Australia\u2019s most capped national team player with 152 to her name. She captains the side tonight. In comes Mackenzie Arnold for goalkeeper Lydia Williams, while Aivi Luik gets the nod to start in the centre of defence. Caitlin Foord misses out with a quad strain.  And the Czech line-up for you:   Updated at 10.43am GMT    7.30am   Preamble  Hello. The countdown to the big kick-off is well and truly on! By my reckoning there are just 154 days to go before Australia meet Ireland at Stadium Australia (after New Zealand have opened the tournament against Norway at Eden Park) and the Matildas begin their highly anticipated 2023 Women\u2019s World Cup campaign. Up first though is the small matter of a Cup of Nations, at which the Matildas will be able to test themselves in \u201ctournament mode\u201d and get a bead on how ready they are for a major title tilt. Tonight\u2019s opponents, world No 28 Czech Republic, may not have qualified for the tournament in July and August, but will still provide an opportunity for Matildas coach Tony Gustavsson to tick off some boxes as he enters the final stages of his World Cup preparation. Gustavsson is keen to treat tonight\u2019s match, and the two which follow against No 7-ranked Spain and fellow World Cup finalists Jamaica, as a \u201cdress rehearsal\u201d for the main event. \u201cThat\u2019s what it\u2019s about now: training for tournaments,\u201d he said on Tuesday. \u201cThree unique opponents with very different tactical preparation, and being able to do that in a short turn-around.\u201d The Czechs and the other protagonists in this four-team mini-tournament have apparently been hand picked for this tournament, to give a realistic impression of what the Matildas\u2019 World Cup group will offer (it contains Ireland, Canada and Nigeria). Karel Rada\u2019s team have enjoyed some excellent results of late, including a couple of goalless draws against top opposition \u2013 the top-ranked US at last year\u2019s She Believes Cup and European champions England in a friendly in October. The glorious Central Coast Stadium is the venue for tonight\u2019s game. It\u2019s a balmy evening in Gosford, with the mercury tipping 25C at the moment. Do feel free to get in touch with an email (mike.hytner@theguardian.com) or on Twitter (@mike_hytner). Otherwise, strap yourselves in for a fun evening ahead.  Updated at 7.56am GMT "

                    "body": "France It was the collective sense of purpose and unity that was most striking as France collected their grand chelem and rose to second in the world rankings. In the past they would suffer a setback and often allow it to distract them. Now they have everything a champion rugby team need: talent, power and, crucially, composure. Only in Wales, where the fear of a Friday night slip-up briefly diverted them down a tactical cul\u2011de\u2011sac, did their most influential players show any signs of confusion. The clarity of their gameplan was a lesson to other teams and previously unsung players such as Gabin Villi\u00e8re, Melvyn Jaminet and Jonathan Danty have stepped up to complement the bigger names around them. Shaun Edwards\u2019s defensive urgings have also made a massive difference and the French public are swooning. By the time the World Cup kicks off in Paris in 2023, they may be firm favourites.  Ireland By most measures Ireland had a productive season. Their tally of 24 tries was the second highest in Six Nations history - albeit boosted by a field day against a 13-man Italy - and they also conceded only four in five games, the fewest in the tournament. There is absolutely no shame, either, in losing in Paris against quality French opposition. In Hugo Keenan, Josh van der Flier and Caelan Doris they had unflashy players who would all be on the plane if a Lions tour was coming up. There remains a sense, though, that a more reliable gauge of their World Cup readiness will be the Test series in New Zealand this summer. Winning at home \u2013 or away against a 14-man England \u2013 is all very well but another level will be required to beat the All Blacks in their own backyard. They look a more formidable pack with R\u00f3nan Kelleher and Andrew Porter on the field but Tadhg Beirne, Jamison Gibson-Park and Michael Lowry add a dash of something different and there are plenty of youngsters awaiting a chance. England Only Italy scored fewer tries than England, who lost three of their five games for the second Six Nations in a row. People still harking back to their 2019 World Cup final appearance need to wake up and realise they are now appreciably behind France and Ireland. Ellis Genge, Marcus Smith, Freddie Steward and Alex Dombrandt will all learn plenty from this tournament but England rarely have the set-piece dominance or midfield line-breakers to allow Smith to weave the kind of spells he does for Harlequins. Nor is asking Genge to truck it up repeatedly from his own 22 going to concern top-class opposition. Alfie Barbeary is a name to watch while Henry Arundell has scored some blistering tries for the under-20s but, with only 12 Tests between now and the World Cup, the window for experimentation is closing fast.   Scotland Considering the squad at their disposal and an upbeat start to the tournament, Scotland\u2019s subsequent decline has to be a concern. Worse things happen than players having a couple of beers after a win but trust between players and management seems to be fraying again and any positivity has rapidly evaporated. The good news is that Cameron Redpath is a class player and will enhance Scotland\u2019s attacking options, while Rory Darge looks to have a long and fruitful Scotland career ahead of him. Jamie Ritchie will make a difference when he is fit and may yet assume the captaincy if Gregor Townsend feels a change of leadership is required. Ultimately, though, Scotland were subdued by a moderate Wales and lost comfortably against France and Ireland. Even against England at Murrayfield they took a long time to get going; their summer tour to Argentina suddenly feels hugely significant. Wales Of all the head coaches currently under pressure, Wayne Pivac has the most to worry about. Having contrived to lose at home against Italy for the first time, his side are facing the daunting prospect of a three-Test summer series against the world champions South Africa. Their injury list should have eased by then but the spirit that earned a win against Scotland and ran England close at Twickenham needs to be allied to more forward dynamism and smarter thinking. When the captain, Dan Biggar, suggested \u201cit might be the last chance for a lot of players\u201d after the Italy defeat he was speaking against a backdrop of disappointing age\u2011group and regional results and financial uncertainty, none of which is making Pivac\u2019s job any easier. Reasons to be cheerful? The lovely gesture from Josh Adams, who handed his man of the match medal to Italian opponent Ange Capuozzo, and the character in adversity of Will Rowlands and Nick Tompkins.  Italy As the dust settles on their Cardiff carnival, the end\u2011of\u2011season list that will give Italy most heart is the U20 championship table. Three wins in five matches \u2013 against England, Wales and Scotland \u2013 is another sign of better times ahead and the young players now involved in the senior squad seem determined to give it a proper rattle. Capuozzo will not create miracle tries every week but his have-a-go enthusiasm is infectious and Kieran Crowley seems to be instilling more belief. Michele Lamaro\u2019s captaincy, particularly in impossible circumstances against Ireland, was impressive and Monty Ioane proved a threat on the wing. The Azzurri can finally look everyone in the eye and insist the Six Nations would be a poorer place without them. This is an extract from our weekly rugby union email, the Breakdown.

                    "body": "Graham Potter admitted Chelsea\u2019s comprehensive FA Cup defeat at Manchester City was \u201cpainful\u201d and not good enough as his four-month reign as manager suffered another setback at the Etihad Stadium.\nChelsea fans booed their team off at half-time and full time and also chanted for the former manager Thomas Tuchel and the former owner Roman Abramovich as they endured a fifth defeat in seven matches.\nThe visitors were 3-0 down by half-time as Pep Guardiola\u2019s team cruised into a fourth-round home tie against Oxford or Arsenal.\n\n\u201cThe first half was painful and tough for us all,\u201d the Chelsea manager said. \u201cWe were second best to a very, very good side. We are not in a great moment and even though it was a cagey first 20 minutes we couldn\u2019t attack the backline well enough, we couldn\u2019t attack as well as we would like. Manchester City are very good at stopping you doing that but at the same time we struggled.\n\u201cIn terms of the Premier League we have lost four matches \u2013 to Newcastle away, when we had nine players unavailable, we lost 1-0 to Arsenal, we lost on a bad day to Brighton and we lost to Manchester City. We have also drawn to Manchester United and Brentford so the results in a small space of time aren\u2019t positive.\n\u201cYou can make excuses and look for reasons or say it isn\u2019t good enough. Both of those answers are correct. We have to keep improving and stick together because clearly we are suffering as a football club and it\u2019s not nice at all. But that\u2019s where we are at the moment.\u201d\nThe former Brighton manager accepted the criticism and the chants that came from the away section. \u201cYou understand the supporters\u2019 frustration, we respect that,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are always other opinions and negativity and criticism because the results haven\u2019t been positive. That\u2019s part of the job and part of the challenge.\u201d\nPotter has pleaded for time at Chelsea, comparing his situation to Guardiola\u2019s first season at the Etihad Stadium, and the City manager insisted it had to be granted.\nGuardiola said: \u201cI would say to Todd Boehly, \u2018Give him time\u2019. I know in the big clubs the results are important but I would say give him time. What he has done in Brighton was outstanding, but all managers need time. We needed time in my first season.\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t the same in Barcelona because I had Messi there. That\u2019s why I didn\u2019t need two seasons, only one season. To play City when we are at this level is not easy. Not just for Graham or Chelsea but for every team.\u201d\nThe Football Association, meanwhile, has condemned the chants of \u201cChelsea rent boys\u201d from some Manchester City fans during the game.\nAn FA spokesperson said: \u201cWe strongly condemn the use of the term \u2018rent boy\u2019 and we are determined to drive it out of our game. We continue to work closely with the Crown Prosecution Service, as well as the UK Football Policing Unit, in relation to the use of this term. Part of our work in this area has been to provide the relevant authorities with impact statements from LGBTQ+ supporters, detailing how chants of this nature affects their experience and feeling of inclusion at football matches, so that a clearer stance and understanding on the chant can be established.\n\u201cWe stand firmly against all forms of discrimination and we are striving to ensure our game is a safe environment for all, which truly embraces diversity and challenges hateful conduct both on and off the pitch.\u201d\nCity said in a statement: \u201cManchester City strongly condemns the behaviour of a minority of fans who engaged in discriminatory chanting at today\u2019s match. We are proud to celebrate inclusivity in football and ask all fans to join us in creating a positive environment and atmosphere, where everyone is welcomed, accepted and has a fantastic matchday experience.\u201d"

                    "body": "This defeat does not mark the end of Sale\u2019s Champions Cup campaign but demonstrates they still have considerable ground to make up to be considered contenders. They areflying high in the Premiership but they have now comprehensively been beaten by Toulouse home and away. It was a disastrous day for the Sharks \u2013 losing key players to injury as well as Cobus Wiese to a first-half red card \u2013 but credit Toulouse for the professional manner in which they closed the match out.\nIt was not a vintage performance by the five-times champions but it did not need to be. Not with Sale\u2019s indiscipline costing them dearly and not with a full-back with the kind of accuracy possessed by Melvyn Jaminet, who finished with 17 points. Sale will now attempt to get this result out of their systems and book their place in the knockout stages when they travel to Ulster next Saturday.\n\n\u201cWe talked about needing to be at our best to give us a chance of overturning Toulouse and we were nowhere near our best,\u201d said the Sale director of rugby, Alex Sanderson. \u201cTaking the early curveballs of losing both props and Cobus out, you\u2019ve still got to be better at your basics. We didn\u2019t do that well enough to deserve the result, as the scoreline indicates.\u201d\nYou got the feeling it was not going to be Sale\u2019s day after just eight seconds when their two props, Simon McIntyre and Nick Schonert, collided as they chased Rob du Preez\u2019s kick-off and attempted to make a tackle. Both were replaced \u2013 Schonert\u2019s head covered in blood \u2013 and neither returned.\nSale are made of stern stuff under Sanderson and though they lost the ensuing scrum they held their own at the set-piece thereafter and might have had the opening try after four minutes had Rob du Preez\u2019s long pass to Tom O\u2019Flaherty been more accurate. No matter, it was not long in coming with Akker van der Merwe barrelling over from close range.\nMidway through the first half Wiese was shown the red card for a dangerous clear-out on Dorian Aldegheri, making Sale\u2019s task all the more difficult. The referee, Mike Adamson, was whistle happy throughout but Wiese can have no complaints with the decision.\n\nToulouse did register a penalty through Jaminet but were unable to fully capitalise on their numerical advantage. They broke down the right through Romain Ntamack but Sam Dugdale made an excellent converting tackle on Antoine Dupont before a forward pass let the Sharks off the hook. Dupont, truth be told, was having a stinker of a half. A loose pass on the right was swiftly followed by a knock-on at the base of a scrum \u2013 both mistakes met with a huge cheer from the crowd who were beginning to sense an improbable victory.\n\nIt became a less likely prospect when Jaminet kicked Toulouse into the lead with his second penalty four minutes into the second half, all the more so when he made it three from three with half an hour remaining \u2013 Toulouse able to seize the initiative with Sale coughing up too many penalties.\nWith their noses in front and aware that it was not a day to fling the ball about, Toulouse proceeded to put the squeeze on Sale. Two more penalties from the lethally accurate Jaminet gave the visitors a 10-point cushion before Emmanuel Meafou\u2019s close-range try \u2013 after a delightful inside flick from Dupont in the buildup \u2013 made sure of victory. Sale\u2019s resistance was broken by this stage and a Toulouse break down the left was eventually finished by the replacement hooker Guillaume Cramont to put the gloss on the scoreline."

                    "body": "The FA Cup could be just the distraction West Ham need. They may not be out the woods just yet but, after Jarrod Bowen extended his resurgence in front of goal, this third win in five games continued to lift the sense of impending doom around the club as David Moyes\u2019s team booked yet another cup tie away to Manchester United. Bowen, whose two goals against Everton helped West Ham climb out of the relegation zone, scored the first goal and made the second for Michail Antonio as the Premier League side ensured they did not slip on any passing fruit that Derby County, the League One promotion-chasers, might have resembled.  For the fifth time in seven seasons, West Ham will travel to face United in a domestic cup and if Premier League fixtures against Newcastle, Chelsea and Tottenham also appear daunting, then at least Moyes has managed to get a tune from his players to restore confidence levels. \u201cIt\u2019s a really good game for us,\u201d the former Manchester United manager said. \u201cThese are the kind of games we need. We\u2019ve got players who want to play on the big stage, we\u2019ve got players who can play on the big stage, and there\u2019s none bigger than Old Trafford. So I\u2019m saying to the players, \u2018let\u2019s go and take them on and challenge them\u2019. \u201cUnited are playing really well, the manager\u2019s doing a great job for them. It will be a tough, tough game but why not? If you\u2019re going to get to the cup final, you\u2019re going to have to figure a way of knocking a few of the bigger teams out along the road.\u201d If that win over Everton looked like winning a last-chance saloon shootout, Frank Lampard losing his job as Moyes retained his, this victory should top up the self-belief. Derby are left to focus on consolidating their playoff place as, defeated in 90 minutes for the first time in 20 games, they were far from disgraced by their top-flight visitors. Paul Warne, the Derby manager, was far from disappointed on the anniversary of the day 8,000 fans marched from the city centre to show their support for a club that was in administration and confusion before David Clowes\u2019 takeover steadied the ship. \u201cI\u2019m really proud,\u201d Warne said. \u201cI asked the lads to puff their chests out and I showed them a video of a year ago today when the whole city got behind us. \u201cThe simple answer is [West Ham] are better. We didn\u2019t have enough guile in the final third. There were moments when we moved the ball well but United defended really well. Deep down I\u2019m not sad. All I ask the lads to do is put on the best version of themselves. They can go home proud of that.  \u201cIt was all about the performance. I know I\u2019m paid to win games. If we\u2019d have been honking and sneaked a 1-0, I wouldn\u2019t have been happy. All in all, I\u2019m chuffed.\u201d The worst news for Derby was the loss of vice-captain Max Bird, who limped off with a groin injury that could rule him out for two to eight weeks, according to Warne. \u201cLosing Max is a massive blow,\u201d the manager said. \u201cI\u2019d have preferred to have lost 8-0 than to lose Birdy.\u201d West Ham were able to make five changes and rest their midfield engine room of Declan Rice and Lucas Paquet\u00e1. But it was one star who stayed in the starting lineup that helped them capitalise on a sharp start with a 10th-minute breakthrough. There are 32 rungs between these two teams and the gap showed. The goal was preceded by a slick buildup before the much-castigated Tomas Soucek ran decisively onto a return pass from Antonio to get clear, wide in the six-yard area, and head the ball back over Craig Forsyth for Bowen to tap home from close range for his eighth goal of the season. Derby played their way into the game, without creating a clearcut opportunity. Within five minutes of the restart, however, West Ham had sealed the game. When Bowen profited from an attempted clearance to scamper away down the right-wing and cross, albeit via a deflection off Forsyth that lifted the ball over Curtis Davies, Antonio was waiting in the box to nod in his sixth goal of the campaign. Derby had extended their long unbeaten run by winning 2-1 at Port Vale last Tuesday, with two goals in the final three minutes, but this game represented a bridge too far. Still, nine points clear of seventh place in League One, they can head to Morecambe with their heads held high."

                    "body": "Robert Milkins Alcohol, sportspeople and common sense are rarely seen together, and it\u2019s been another year full of salutary stories. Take, for example, the South Korean three-time Olympic medal-winning speed skater Kim Min-seok, who in August gave three fellow skaters a lift home from a friend\u2019s birthday party at the national training centre near Seoul, drove straight into a crash barrier and earned an 18-month ban from the sport (two of his passengers were banned for six months for abetting drink driving and a coach who wasn\u2019t even there got a year for \u201clack of oversight\u201d; Kim never got as far as a public road and thus avoided criminal prosecution). But the year\u2019s most humiliating booze-related sporting incident came in Antalya in March, when the English snooker player Robert Milkins turned up for the opening ceremony of the Turkish Masters having already enthusiastically celebrated his birthday, drunkenly confronted a senior official, injured himself falling over in the toilets and ended up having his stomach pumped in hospital. \u201cI genuinely don\u2019t know exactly what happened, I was in a state where I didn\u2019t know where I was,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen I got to the toilet I lost my legs and think I hit my chin on the sink or the ground, cutting it open. I was almost knocked out, and I\u2019m pretty sure I have broken ribs. If I had my stomach pumped I don\u2019t remember that either.\u201d The bump on the head can\u2019t have damaged him too badly \u2013 after 27 years as a professional in which he had never got his hands on a trophy, he won his next tournament \u2013 the Gibraltar Open. Draymond Green There are apologies and there are apologies, and basketball player Draymond Green was truly in a sorry state in October after video emerged of him landing a proper full-on right hook on his Golden State Warriors teammate Jordan Poole in practice. \u201cI failed as a man,\u201d said the longtime controversy-magnet. \u201cI am a very flawed human being.\u201d Green has repeatedly proved as much, his previous greatest hits including being suspended for a crucial game of the 2016 NBA finals after whacking LeBron James in the groin, accidentally posting a picture of his own very much unclothed groin on Snapchat (he said it was \u201cintended to be a private message\u201d and that \u201cwe\u2019re all one click away from placing something in the wrong place\u201d) and another suspension for arguing with another teammate, Kevin Durant. None of this seems to have particularly damaged his self-esteem. \u201cI\u2019m the best defender to ever play this game,\u201d he says. \u201c100%.\u201d Also hitting someone he shouldn\u2019t have this year: Indian wrestler Satender Malik, who punched a referee after losing the under-125kg final at his country\u2019s Commonwealth Games qualifiers, and was duly banned for life. A few weeks later he was banned for another four years, if such a thing is possible, having allegedly \u201crun away from the venue without informing anyone\u201d after being summoned for a dope test.  Elton Jantjies It\u2019s been a memorable year for 42-times capped South African rugby union international Elton Jantjies. In May he returned alone from a family holiday to Turkey, a journey so unusual that upon arrival in Johannesburg he was immediately arrested for \u201cmalicious damage to property\u201d. Apparently he had broken a glass and damaged the screen and the light at his business class seat, while a passenger in economy claimed of seeing him totter to a toilet \u2013 \u201che struggled to keep his balance\u201d \u2013 and bang on the door so hard his knuckles bled, all the while beseeching the air hostess, who had locked herself inside for her own protection to \u201ckomaan, my skat\u201d, Afrikaans for \u201ccome on, my darling\u201d. By the time he gave up there was \u201cblood all over the toilet door\u201d. In September he was sent home from a tour of Argentina after reports emerged of him leaving the team hotel and checking into a different one with the team\u2019s dietician, Zeenat Simjee. He admitted the affair, while Simjee\u2019s lawyer insisted he had been not with her but with another woman. She went with the team on their winter trip to Europe but Jantjies stayed in South Africa and moved into a rehab facility for a \u2018\u201cmental break\u201d and to \u201ctreat his insomnia\u201d. \u201cAs a fly-half, I believe to be playing Test rugby I need to be sleeping perfectly,\u201d he said.  Jacob Runyan and Chase Cominsky It has been an epic year for cheating controversies and conspiracies, a year in which the concept of vibrating anal beads in chess, for better or worse, leaped irreversibly into the public consciousness. But who, from this crowded field, deserves a place in the Anti-Spoty spotlight? Step forward Runyan and Cominsky, and the moment the successful fishing duo were knocked off their perch \u2013 and also their pike, their bass and their catfish. It was not the first time the pair\u2019s integrity had been questioned \u2013 after they won the Fall Brawl on Lake Erie last year Cominsky failed a mandatory polygraph test, meaning they were denied the first prize of a $125,000 boat (happily they passed the tests for another competition they won that same weekend, sailing home with a $152,000 boat). Back then Runyan said the pair were \u201cpursuing legal recourse\u201d, adding that he was \u201cpretty good at picking out where there\u2019s shady stuff going on\u201d. Sadly for him so was Jason Fischer, director of this year\u2019s Lake Erie Walleye Trail, who in September grew suspicious about the impressive weight of the less impressively sized fish Runyan and Cominsky had landed, sliced one open and started pulling out lead weights. Instead of netting them a prize of $28,760 they found themselves in hot water for a change, charged with one count apiece of cheating, attempted grand theft, possessing criminal tools and unlawful ownership of wild animals. They also inspired major fishing competitions to start investing in metal detectors. The pair pleaded not guilty to the charges. \u201cThis has been terrible for fishing as a sport,\u201d said Ron Taylor, a semi-pro bass fisherman. \u201cIt\u2019s been hard on the people who are playing by the rules and I think for people who just like to hear about catching big fish.\u201d Sander van Ginkel  It was a Winter Olympics year, which is basically a guarantee of controversy, and Van Ginkel took the gold medal in a hotly competed field, pipping the mixed team ski jumping jumpsuit-based disqualification madness. Van Ginkel was the sports scientist employed by the Dutch speed skating team who mounted a strategic influencing campaign on Beijing\u2019s Canadian icemaster, Mark Messer, in an attempt to force him into making ice that would suit his nation\u2019s skaters. Far from hiding his involvement, he happily gave interviews about it. \u201cThe colder the ice, the harder it gets,\u201d he explained. \u201cMany other countries produce skaters who have more of a shorter stroke and for whom hard ice is less important. I try to create the best possible conditions for our skaters, and I hope to convince Messer and his people of my ideas. I think he and his staff are genuinely interested in what I have to say.\u201d This did not go down well with rival skaters. \u201cThis is far from fair play, this is corruption,\u201d said Sweden\u2019s Nils van der Poel. \u201cThis is the biggest scandal in our sport. We\u2019ve had doping cases but I don\u2019t see this as being less serious. They have a guy whose job is to put pressure on the ice maker to change the ice for the benefit of the Netherlands. However the best ice for me is when the ice is bad. I\u2019m quite good when the ice is bad.\u201d The Dutch won six of 14 gold medals in the sport, massively dominating the medals table, but the ice can\u2019t have been that great: Van der Poel won two golds of his own.  Anti-Spoty special award for gaslighting The state of Qatar, for hosting, in the middle of the World Cup, the 2022 Anti-Corruption Excellence Awards or, to give them their official title after they were named in honour of the nation\u2019s emir, the Sheikh Tamim Bin Hamad Al-Thani International Excellence Awards. For the first time this year an award was given specifically for a leader of the fight against corruption in sport; among the guests for the ceremony, Corruption\u2019s Fifa\u2019s own Gianni Infantino. Anti-Spoty quote of the year \u201cThat stomach, those abs, those pictures you send so I can keep tabs / You make me feel funny down there. Especially when you\u2019re there and you look up and stare / I\u2019m gonna end by saying you are my love, my friend, my soul / And most of all you believe in me which makes me as hard as a totem pole.\u201d \u2013 Ryan Giggs\u2019s romantic poetry, as read out in court during his trial for displaying controlling or coercive behaviour towards the poem\u2019s subject, Kate Greville. The jurors were unable to reach a verdict and a retrial has been scheduled for next summer."

FA Cup: Connor Wickham closed out Forest Green\u2019s win over South Shields with a Puskas Award contender from near the halfway line. Spotting the South Shields goalkeeper Myles Boney a few yards out of his goal, the well-travelled striker tried his luck and sent a sensational chip into the top corner, the only place the frantically back-pedalling Boney couldn\u2019t reach it. It was Wickham\u2019s second of the game and almost certainly the best goal he\u2019s ever scored. Have that!

Sheffield United 3-2 Burnley (Robinson 65)  Championship: It\u2019s been quite the game of two halves for Jack Robinson, who was directly responsible for two Burnley goals in the first half, but has since atoned. After helping to set up Sheffield United\u2019s second goal against the league leaders, he\u2019s just scored their third. Burnley are serioously under the cosh and struggling to deal with United\u2019s set pieces.      1.52pm    Yellow card watch: There are 11 Premier League footballers who are just one booking away from a Premier League suspension and also harbouring hopes of going to the World Cup. Only a cynic would suggest that some of them might deliberately try to pick one up today or tomorrow in order to give themselves next weekend off and hugely reduce their chances of picking up an dream-ending injury ahead of Qatar, but for curiosity\u2019s sake, they might be worth keeping an eye on. Those to watch: Chris Mepham (Bournemouth), Aleksandar Mitrovic (Fulham), Alexis Mac Allister (Brighton), Amadou Onana (Everton), Diego Dalot (Manchester United), Thilo Kehrer (West Ham), Fabian Schar (Newcastle), Gabriel Jesus (Arsenal), William Saliba (Arsenal), Rodrigo Bentancur (Tottenham) and Harry Kane (Tottenham).

It\u2019s currently 2-2 in a thriller, with Sheffield United coming from behind twice despite a first-half horror show from Jack Robinson. Not content with turning a Manuel Benson cross into his own net with a bullet header, the Sheffield United defender subsequently dawdled on the ball just outside his own penalty area, allowing Benson to rob him of possession and fire past Wes Foderingham. Iliman Ndiaye scored for Sheffield United in the first half, while Robinson was instrumental in creating United\u2019s second, which was just scored by Oli McBurnie.

                    "body": "Cristiano Ronaldo scored twice as Portugal swept to an emphatic 4-0 victory over Switzerland in the Nations League, while new Manchester City signing Erling Haaland also scored twice as Norway beat Sweden 2-1. William Carvalho and Jo\u00e3o Cancelo were also on the scoresheet as hosts Portugal wasted numerous opportunities to inflict more humiliation on the visitors, who suffered their biggest defeat since losing to Germany by the same scoreline in 2008.  Portugal have four points from their opening two Group A2 matches and are ahead of second-place Czech Republic on goal difference. Switzerland are on zero after back-to-back losses and are now winless in their last four encounters since they qualified for the World Cup in Qatar. Carvalho opened the scoring when he reacted quickest to the loose ball when Ronaldo\u2019s free-kick was parried, before the latter bagged a quickfire brace to extend his record tally of international goals to 117. Ronaldo should have had a hat-trick when he wasted two excellent opportunities before half-time, the first a barely believable miss from six yards, but it was left to Cancelo to score the fourth for Portugal in the second half. Elsewhere in Group A2, a late goal from defender I\u00f1igo Mart\u00ednez rescued a 2-2 draw for Spain against Czech Republic. Sparta Prague forward Jakub Pesek scored from close range in the fourth minute, connecting with a pass from Jan Kuchta who got in behind Spain\u2019s defence. The visitors equalised on the strike of half-time when Spain midfielder Gavi beat Czech goalkeeper Tomas Vaclik with a shot to the far post. However, the Czechs retook the lead in the 66th minute when forward Jan Kuchta lobbed goalkeeper Unai Simon from just outside the area after he was sent through on goal alone. Spain scored in the 90th minute to break the hearts of the home fans when Mart\u00ednez connected with a cross from Marco Asensio and his header just crossed the line. In Group B4, Haaland struck a goal in each half to bring his international tally to 18 in 19 games. The visitors took the lead when Morten Thorsby was awarded a soft penalty by referee Anthony Taylor for some innocuous contact in the box by Emil Krafth. Haaland, who scored the winner against Serbia in their opening game, thumped the spot kick to the right of Robin Olsen in the 20th minute. Sweden\u2019s only attempts on target in the opening 45 minutes came from a pair of Emil Forsberg free kicks just before the break, but despite a string of decent attacks and set pieces early in the second half, they couldn\u2019t manage to fashion an equaliser. Haaland made them pay in the 69th minute, latching on to a loose ball and surging powerfully into the box before flashing a low right-foot shot across Olsen and into the net to make it 2-0. Haaland missed a great chance to complete his hat-trick three minutes later and was replaced by Joshua King soon after. Anthony Elanga scored a stoppage time goal for the Swedes that proved too little, too late as Norway held on to win.  Meanwhile, Ian Baraclough insisted he could handle the criticism which will come his way after Northern Ireland\u2019s latest Nations League setback as he called for patience with a young squad finding its way. The same problems that were evident in Thursday\u2019s disappointing 1-0 home defeat to Greece plagued Northern Ireland again in a poor goalless draw with a Cyprus side who should arguably have won the contest in Larnaca as Baraclough\u2019s men turned in another disjointed performance. The draw extends Northern Ireland\u2019s winless run in this competition to 12 matches, and this was only their third ever point. In a week when Baraclough has already faced questions about pressure, sections of the 600-strong travelling support greeted the final whistle with jeers at the AEK Arena with some fans frustrated at the lack of progress. \u201cThere are always people questioning your position,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople aren\u2019t happy when you win games because you\u2019re not winning them by big enough margins. It comes with the territory. I\u2019ve got thick skin.\u201d"

                    "body": "Bruno Fernandes had to be convinced Manchester United were intent on challenging for trophies before he signed his new contract in April. The 28-year-old agreed a fresh four-year deal with an option of a further 12 months only after John Murtough, the football director, and Darren Fletcher, the technical director, assured him United had a clear plan despite then having an interim manager, Ralf Rangnick.  \u201cI came to the club and my aim is winning trophies, because I know how big this club is and I know how big we can still be,\u201d said Fernandes. \u201cSo I had a conversation last year [season] when everyone knew that Ralf was not the coach for the future. \u201cI said I want to be helpful for the club, but I also want to know where we are going. Is there a plan, a future? This was before I signed my new contract because I said to the club: \u2018Obviously money is important, no one can hide that, it\u2019s always important to earn more and more in football or life; you always want to have the best for yourself.\u2019 \u201cBut at that time, I said: \u2018I\u2019m on good money, I don\u2019t want a new contract without knowing that we have a good future in the club. I want to know where we are going. I don\u2019t need to know who the manager is, but I want to know as a club, do you think we have a future? Does the club want to achieve trophies or does the club want to build something to go to the Champions League?\u2019 Because for me, that\u2019s not enough and the club demands more, the quality of the players we have. It demands more than just being here and fighting for fourth place. It demands trophies, at least fighting for trophies.\u201d Fernandes was happy with the response. \u201cThe club said they have a plan, this is what they want, we agree with you that the level of the club has to be better than it has been in the past, we can achieve much more, we can do much more,\u201d the attacking midfielder said. \u201cThat\u2019s why I have never had my head out of here but was making sure the club is still in the same direction that it was when I signed [in January 2020]. First of all [I speak to] John and Darren Fletcher because they\u2019re the people we have close for the players to talk to. That was the conversation I had with them.\u201d Erik ten Hag, who became the manager, has guided United to fourth place going into Saturday\u2019s derby at home to Manchester City. After his side lost the reverse fixture 6-3, he said his players lacked courage and he wants them to be \u201cbrave\u201d this time. \u201cIt is a way of playing, in possession, so you give each other options, scanning the right moment, taking the right decisions, go forward when it\u2019s possible,\u201d he said. \u201cFor defending, be front foot, be aggressive. As a team, act with togetherness, so have the same ideas in every situation.\u201d"

                    "body": "Liverpool\u2019s assistant manager, Pep Lijnders, has welcomed attempts to improve relations with Manchester City and accepted there is responsibility on the coaching staff of both clubs to behave. City and Liverpool, who meet in the last 16 of the Carabao Cup on Thursday, issued a joint statement this week appealing for an end to the \u201cunacceptable behaviours\u201d that have marred matches between the pair in recent years and promising to ban supporters who commit them. Their most recent encounter, Liverpool\u2019s 1-0 win at Anfield in October, featured coins being thrown at Pep Guardiola, City fans chanting and scrawling graffiti in relation to the Hillsborough and Heysel disasters and J\u00fcrgen Klopp falsely accused of \u201cborderline xenophobia\u201d in an anonymous briefing after the game.  City also alleged their team coach had been attacked outside Anfield, as was the case before their Champions League game in 2018. The two clubs have worked subsequently with their fan groups on initiatives to improve the atmosphere around the fixture and Lijnders says there must be more respect in the Premier League\u2019s dominant rivalry. Liverpool\u2019s assistant manager said: \u201cIt\u2019s very positive that both clubs are cooperating. Ferran and Billy [Soriano and Hogan, the respective chief executives of City and Liverpool] made a good statement. \u201cI worked at Porto for seven years and PSV Eindhoven for five years and the rivalry between PSV, Feyenoord and Ajax was from a different level. The rivalry between Porto, Benfica and Sporting was a different level. The only reason it\u2019s a rivalry is because the games matter, the games are decisive. Tomorrow is a decisive game, but playing against City has this importance. \u201cWith rivalry comes emotion and that\u2019s good because we need emotions from the stand, we need emotion for our players. The only problem with emotion is when there\u2019s no respect, then it becomes really harmful and that can\u2019t happen. It happened, but it\u2019s positive that both clubs are cooperating.\u201d  Klopp was sent off for haranguing the assistant referee in the closing minutes of October\u2019s game and served a one-match touchline ban, while Guardiola vented his anger at the fourth official after City were denied a penalty. Lijnders, asked whether the onus was also on the coaches to behave, said: \u201cOf course. Top sport is emotion, it\u2019s going to edges. Top sport is seeing the line that you want to go over but you hold yourself. \u201cFor us, it\u2019s impossible to be fully emotional because the game is too quick for that. The ones who control their emotions are always the ones who go furthest. Control your emotions, don\u2019t let the emotions control you. We are an example of that in our team.\u201d Liverpool have most of their World Cup contingent available for the tie \u2013 only Ibrahima Konat\u00e9 is absent having featured in Sunday\u2019s final for France \u2013 but Lijnders said youngsters such as Ben Doak, Bobby Clark and Stefan Bajcetic would be involved. \u201cIt is a different situation with players coming back from the World Cup,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we still believe we need to give our talents chances against top opponents, to have difficulties and to struggle a little bit, as only then can you improve.\u201d "

                    "body": "The dangerous and damaging myth of \u201cpolitical neutrality\u201d in sport, long peddled by the likes of the International Olympic Committee and Fifa, has completely disintegrated in response to Russia\u2019s barbarous, unprovoked and unjustifiable invasion of Ukraine. For too long, those in positions of power at the highest echelons of the global sporting ecosystem have cosied up to authoritarian regimes and brutal dictators, turned their heads away from the plight of fellow human beings as their rights have been withheld or curtailed, and allowed commercial interest to trump common interest. But this time sport has been forced to pick a side, and really mean it. Fuelled by overwhelming global public outrage and the uniting spirit of solidarity with the Ukrainian people, governing bodies, clubs, teams, sponsors and athletes have been asked to wield their power and influence to do whatever they can to bring about peace, draw attention to the need for safe routes for all those fleeing the conflict, and promote wider condemnation and ostracism of Putin\u2019s regime. Sport\u2019s only utility to wider society is when it lives true to its stated values \u2013 when it acts to make the world a better place and dares to speak up and speak out in support of the universal principles upon which it is based. Sport must never be allowed to peddle the lie that its strength lies in cowardly nods to \u201cneutrality\u201d. It doesn\u2019t now; it never has; it never will. Its strength lies in its truly global influence, its uniting, cross-cultural spirit of togetherness, and its fiercely confident promotion of the very best of our shared values.Tim HarperExecutive director, Equitysport \u2022 Have an opinion on anything you\u2019ve read in the Guardian today?

                    "body": "  9.59pm    That\u2019s all from me. Thanks for your emails and tweets. Here\u2019s Pete Lansley\u2019s match report.  And here are all the full details of the FA Cup fifth-round draw, which took place just before kick-off.       9.57pm    Paul Warne, the Derby manager, is next out to speak.   At times we went toe-to-toe. The lads gave me the best version of themselves. It\u2019s Premier League against League One. Their front line is worth \u00a3100m [err?]. Luckily they\u2019ve got an easy draw in the next round. I\u2019ve got a hotel room in Wembley for the FA Cup final, so will have to get a refund on that.   There\u2019s also an injury update from Warne:   Unfortunately Max Bird has damaged his groin, a big blow for us.       9.45pm    Some post-match quotes from Pablo Fornals and Jarrod Bowen.  Fornals:  Everyone knows this hasn\u2019t been an easy season for us. Every game that we can win is massive for us. For our confidence.   Bowen speaks!  It\u2019s all about momentum. We can make this as a real springboard. It was a massive goal for Micky [Antonio]. We\u2019ve been working on those tap-in goals. It\u2019s never easy [in the FA Cup]. If you want to win those competitions, you have to beat the best.       9.36pm   Full-time: Derby County 0-2 West Ham  The Hammers have earned a trip to Manchester United in the fifth round. One goal early in each half did for the League One side.  Updated at 10.33pm GMT    9.34pm    90 min: Three minutes added on. West Ham are sitting in, happy to let Derby have the ball.      9.33pm    88 min: Another change for the visitors: Manuel Lanzini on for Pablo Fornals. All the substitutions have broken up the game, which has suited West Ham.      9.32pm    86 min: Dobbin crashes a shot at Ar\u00e9ola after some fancy footwork, but the shot is well held by the Frenchman. Dobbin would have been better going across goal, and maybe Collins could have poked it home.      9.31pm    83 min: Interested to see Mubama. He\u2019s very popular with the West Ham fans, hailing from Silvertown in east London, and has been with the Hammers since he was eight years old, when he initially joined as a left back.  Here\u2019s what Moyes had to say about the England Under-19 international before this match.   I like him a lot because he\u2019s a boy who reacts like \u2018Wow! What a chance I\u2019ve got here!\u2019. He\u2019s grateful, he has great humility in him with the work he wants to do, and at Fulham we asked him to go on and just chase people down and he was unbelievable at it. He nearly got a standing ovation from the West Ham supporters because of his commitment and his effort.\u201d      9.29pm    79 min: The game is petering out. West Ham have done a good job of managing this through. Lewis Dobbin has threatened since coming on down this right wing, but Derby have otherwise looked a little toothless.      9.25pm    77 min: Double change for the Hammers: 18-year-old striker Divin Mubama comes on for Bowen, while Cresswell replaces Palmieri.      9.24pm    74 min: West Ham fans in excellent voice, belting out a Paolo Di Canio number. The sort of player you can imagine playing for Derby in those Carbone/Kinkladze/Eranio wonderyears, although of course he didn\u2019t.      9.20pm    72 min: Derby make a fifth change. Jake Rooney, no relation of Wayne of course, coming on for Hourihane.      9.19pm    70 min: Benrahma is looking so sharp since his introduction. He is cutting Derby to shreds with his passing and movement. The Algerian sends a beautiful ball to Johnson down the right, and the wing back stings the palms of Wildsmith with a fierce drive.      9.17pm    68 min: \u201cEntirely disagree that it is more important to be fun than to be correct; any fan would be outraged if their team was defeated by an \u2018incorrect\u2019 goal,\u201d emails Richard Hirst. \u201cThe problem is that even with VAR there can be no certainty about correctness; there\u2019s still lots of interpretation about foul play, handball etc.\u201d Yeah, but as anyone that has been in an away end can attest, waiting for a goal to be given/not given, VAR is a desperate business. Just accept there will be things that are going to go wrong. It\u2019s a game, which the vast majority of us watch for fun. Celebrate in the way end. Jump about a bit, without looking over your shoulder/at the big screen!      9.12pm    66 min: Benrahma straight into the action, turning a sneaky ball inside the box to Bowen, who fires straight at Wildsmith from 10 yards out. He should have scored, had a time to take a touch and steady himself. Credit to the Derby keeper for standing tall.      9.11pm    64 min: Some more admin to inform you about, this time from West Ham. Benrahma on for Antonio.      9.10pm    62 min: Four (!) changes for Derby, prompted by Bird\u2019s injury.  On come Eiran Cashin, Liam Thompson, Tony Springett and Lewis Dobbin. Off go Bird, Barkhuizen, Mendez-Laing and Davies.     9.08pm    60 min: Replays are showing a potential penalty shout for Derby, with Johnson colliding with Davies inside the West Ham box. It\u2019s a penalty with Johnson getting 0% of the ball and knocking Davies on his arse. But the referee missed it, and there\u2019s no VAR, so the Hammers get away with one. As we mentioned before, and with apologies to Derby fans, it\u2019s more important to be fun than correct.      9.04pm    58 min: Looks like Bird has actually injured himself taking that shot, so he\u2019s going to have to go off. A nightmare for Paul Warne, that.      9.02pm    56 min: Max Bird tries his luck from range, but it flies high and wide. The 22-year-old is a real talent but has been poor here tonight. He\u2019s got form from range, though. Check out this goal against Cheltenham earlier this month.   Updated at 9.03pm GMT    8.59pm    54 min: Mendez-Laing was nowhere near the 2013-14 Cardiff squad that Medel played in, by the way. He didn\u2019t join the club until 2017! Minus points for me.      8.57pm    52 min: Replays showed Moyes doing a double (!) fist pump at that second goal. He certainly wants that fifth-round tie at Manchester United.      8.56pm   GOAL! Derby 0-2 West Ham (Antonio 50)  Derby are caught cold. Fornals releases Bowen down the right. The England international\u2019s cross is deflected horribly off Forsyth straight to Antonio at the back post and the striker makes no mistake, nodding into an empty net. Forsyth slid in, trying to defend the front post, but got the worst possible touch on it. Had he not touched the ball, Davies behind Forsyth would surely have cleared it.   Updated at 9.01pm GMT    8.53pm    47 min: An email from Tim Smith to get the second half started. \u201cYour description of Mendez-Laing as being a top-heavy footballer and the accompanying photographs of Bowen, making him look decidedly bottom-heavy (very much in the manner of Luke Shaw, Raheem Sterling , Andre Arshavin etc.) reminded me of a long debate once held among teammates about the \u201cfattest\u201d football player. There was no consensus, but it was a picture of Gary Medel wot started it.\u201d I always think of Gary Medel, who I think played with Mendez-Laing at Cardiff \u2013 imagine the SCENES in the dressing room \u2013 as squat rather than fat, but maybe I\u2019m mistaken.      8.49pm    Peeeeeep! We\u2019re back into the action in Derby.      8.33pm    Half-time reading:      8.32pm   Half-time: Derby 0-1 West Ham  The Premier League side are ahead at the break.      8.31pm    45 min: One minute added on here.      8.31pm    44 min: I\u2019m struggling to think of a more top-heavy footballer than Mendez-Laing. Huge shoulders, slim legs. Still, he makes it work!      8.29pm    42 min: Mendez-Laing does brilliantly on the right wing, fooling Palmieri with a stepover to get to the byline, but his low cross is cleared. Derby looking dangerous all of a sudden.      8.25pm    39 min: West Ham showing a bit more control here and carve out a couple of corners. Bird does well to clear the second one away, after a moment of panic in the box when the ball dropped.      8.23pm    37 min: I could listen to Ally McCoist say \u201csuperb\u201d all day. The Scot is on co-commentary duty for ITV today and was describing a touch from Antonio, which was admittedly rather lovely.      8.22pm    35 min: Derby have had 54% of the possession but no shots on target, which is a good synopsis for how this game has gone so far. West Ham are lurking dangerously, ready to spring on the counter-attack.      8.21pm    33 min: An extremely tough chance for Collins, but at the end of a flowing Derby move. Forsyth finds Barkhuizen down the left, and the winger loops a cross towards his centre forward. Collins has to fetch it high out of the sky with his left foot \u2013 think Zidane in the 2002 Champions League final \u2013 but the Irishman can only shin it into the stands. A shame.      8.17pm    30 min: A bit of a lull in play. Aguerd, who impressed with Morocco at the World Cup, and Kehrer, who made the German squad, are struggling with the physicality of Collins.   Updated at 8.32pm GMT    8.15pm    27 min: For balance, here\u2019s an email from Matthew Stephens in support of VAR.  \u201cDon\u2019t we focus wholly on the adjudicative aspects of VAR, forgetting its preventive power? VAR might be a horrible fun-sucker, but it has reduced the regular mauling of attacking players in penalty boxes and also helped to cut back (a little) on simulation.\u201d All of that may be true, but misses the very simple point that when playing football, it\u2019s more important to be fun than to be correct.      8.12pm    25 min: The game is getting a little bitty. Derby won\u2019t mind that. Both Barkhuizen and Collins win free-kicks for the home side in semi-dangerous areas, but Hourihane\u2019s delivery hasn\u2019t quite been on the money. Yet.      8.09pm    21 min: Korey Smith, who has been a real bright spark for Derby on the right, picks up a very questionable booking for a challenge on Palmieri, who made sure he got the referee\u2019s attention with a few roly polies. The Italian is, and you\u2019re gonna love this, fine to continue.      8.05pm    18 min: An email regarding VAR, which (I think we can all agree) can do one.  \u201cDid anyone else notice Bowen\u2019s quick glance to the assistant referee after he\u2019d put the ball in the net,\u201d emails David Wall. \u201cHow refreshing that, seeing they\u2019d not raised their flag, he could celebrate safe in the knowledge that there wasn\u2019t going to be some interminable VAR check with Pride Park not set up for it. Contrast that with Brighton yesterday when Mitoma\u2019s wonderful winner and joyous celebrations were then held in suspends for the video refs to have a second look. I know it\u2019s not going to happen but as well as being ineffective (how is it that Konate\u2019s potential red card for denying a goal scoring opportunity couldn\u2019t be reviewed because of the position on the pitch, and Thiago\u2019s horrible foul wasn\u2019t upgraded from yellow to red?), VAR sucks so much fun from what should be the best part of the game, scoring a goal.\u201d     8.04pm    16 min: Hourihane, who is waaaaaaaaaaay too good for League One and still just 31, is beginning to get his foot on the ball for Derby in central midfield. West Ham have dropped slightly, with wing backs Johnson and Palmieri dropping in to make a back five. They seem content to sit back and counter-attack.   Updated at 8.20pm GMT    8.01pm    14 min: Collins is leading the line for Derby tonight and he got his first sniff of goal from a cross from the right. Smith whipped it in, and it was just too high for the Republic of Ireland international but had Ogbonna and Ar\u00e9ola scrambling. Replays show Collins was actually offside, but there are shoots of optimism there for Derby.      7.59pm    12 min: That was coming, to be honest. Derby look a little light in midfield, and had already been exposed on a couple of occasions before the goal.      7.57pm   GOAL! Derby 0-1 West Ham (Bowen 10)  Bowen doesn\u2019t make the same mistake! This is a really clever goal, with Soucek playing a nifty one-two with Antonio, and the Czech midfielder nods down to Bowen, who fires into the corner from close range!   Updated at 8.01pm GMT    7.55pm    7 min: Another chance for West Ham! Derby again lose in midfield, and this time Bowen bears down on goal, but can only fire straight at Wildsmith. Derby sloppiness again goes unpunished.      7.54pm    5 min: Another email, this time from Bill Preston.  \u201cI think this is going to be one of wild swings. West Ham are going to start strongly, and get a proper stomp on through the first half, but the Derby have decent strength, resolve, and a home tie. They\u2019ll put together wily plays, coupled with thrilling heroics and steal this one.\u201d  Remo Casale has also emailed to say that he fancies Derby. The home side have started well, hustling and bustling with a high press.      7.50pm    3 min: Bird is sloppy in midfield, losing out to Downes, and suddenly West Ham are on the counter-attack. Antonio carries the ball and has runners left and right but instead opts to shoot, firing disappointingly wide. A half-chance.      7.48pm    1 min: Derby so close to the opener. Barkhuizen latches onto a hopeful clearance, but beats the offside trap and sprints through on goal. The recovering pace of Johnson helps force him wide and the former Preston man chooses to cross rather than shoot. The ball pings around the area, before Soucek makes an important block on the edge of the D.      7.46pm    Peeeeeeep! And we\u2019re underway in the east Midlands.      7.45pm    The players are out! Derby are decked in their famous white shirts and black shorts, while West Ham are in their claret and blue.      7.41pm    Our attention returns to Pride Park, where kick-off is just five minutes away.  We have a first email, from David Hopkins. It\u2019s a good one.  \u201cThe very definition of a no lose game for the Rams tonight I think. It\u2019s a year to the day since the fans held a march to the ground to highlight the very real threat of liquidation and one fewer founder members in the Football League. One dalliance with a delusional \u2018crypto millionaire\u2019 followed before David Clowes (who I trust will never be buying his own drink in Derby again) stepped in and saved the club. Derby will likely lose tonight but they\u2019ll be playing again on Saturday and that\u2019s good enough for me.\u201d     7.38pm   The fifth-round draw is in!  A trip to Manchester United awaits for the winner of Derby and West Ham! Gulp \u2026 The draw in full:  Southampton v Luton or Grimsby Leicester City v Blackburn or Birmingham Stoke City v Brighton Wrexham or Sheffield United v Tottenham Fulham or Sunderland v Leeds United Bristol City v Manchester City Manchester United v Derby or West Ham Ipswich or Burnley v Sheffield Wednesday or Fleetwood Town     7.00pm    With the team news in, I\u2019m temporarily hopping over to the liveblog for the FA Cup fifth-round draw. The balls are just about to be drawn. Join me here.   Updated at 7.01pm GMT    6.57pm   Team news  The hosts have plenty of Championship-standard players in their ranks but a real shame to lost McGoldrick to injury. He\u2019s a class act, and kickstarted Derby\u2019s comeback at Port Vale last week, scoring an 87th-minute equaliser, before Nathaniel Mendez-Laing grabbed the winner two minutes later.  West Ham are not quite at full-strength, with Rice and Pacqueta on the bench, but that\u2019s a very tasty XI.       6.52pm   Preamble  Teetering one point above the Premier League drop zone and with a gruelling Europa Conference League campaign to see out this spring, West Ham might view an FA Cup run with a little trepidation. But then, the Hammers haven\u2019t won a major trophy in over 40 years. With nine Premier League teams already out of the FA Cup (including Liverpool, Arsenal, Chelsea, Newcastle), and Declan Rice probably offski in the summer, there is a real opportunity here for a strong West Ham side (on paper at least) to go deep in the competition. And with the fifth-round draw taking place before kick-off, they will even know who their potential opponents could be in the sixth-round.  With plenty of time for his XI to recover before Saturday\u2019s league trip to Newcastle, there will be plenty of West Ham fans hoping that David Moyes fields a strong starting line-up tonight. Third-tier Derby County might not seem like the stiffest task for Moyes and co, but the League One side have not lost since October (!) and have won their last six games on the bounce. Pride Park, under the lights, will be rocking tonight. Join me! Kick-off: 7.45pm GMT.  "

                    "body": "As a midfielder Michael Carrick was so subtly intelligent that spectators in the stands sometimes barely noticed his consistent success in shaping and controlling games. Roy Keane and Patrick Vieira may have possessed greater physical presence and Frank Lampard and Steven Gerrard were definitely more dynamic but Carrick\u2019s technically assured vision prompted valid comparisons to Spain\u2019s Sergio Busquets and Xabi Alonso. Three months into his first managerial posting at Middlesbrough the former West Ham, Manchester United and England anchor is already exerting a similarly understated yet potentially revolutionary effect on this season\u2019s Championship. Carrick appears so quietly unshowy, so modestly down to earth that it is easy to overlook the root-and-branch reform he has undertaken since succeeding Chris Wilder in late October.  \u201cWe\u2019ve tweaked a few things and it\u2019s snowballed,\u201d says the 41-year-old in his soft Tyneside accent as he sits in Wilder\u2019s old seat at Middlesbrough\u2019s outwardly tranquil Rockliffe Park training ground in the village of Hurworth-on-Tees, a few miles south of Darlington. \u201cWe\u2019re flying at the moment.\u201d Until now, his feat in choreographing six wins in Boro\u2019s past seven league games as they have risen from relegation waters to fifth place has gone largely under the radar, but Premier League Brighton are unlikely to underestimate Carrick\u2019s side when they visit the Riverside for Saturday\u2019s third round FA Cup tie. Roberto De Zerbi, the Brighton manager, will appreciate that the former Manchester United coach\u2019s inspired conversion of the previously sidelined former Arsenal striker Chuba Akpom into a goal machine who has scored nine times in his past 10 games is no accident. It seems the tactical acumen of a manager whose replacement of Wilder\u2019s 3-5-2 with a more possession-oriented 4-2-3-1 is just as sharp as the passing range that helped Carrick collect 34 England caps in addition to one Champions League and five Premier League winners\u2019 medals. He also won the FA Cup with United in 2016 but, much as Carrick emphasises his love for the competition, he knows Steve Gibson, Boro\u2019s owner, hired him to return the team to the Premier League \u2013 and ideally this season.  \u201cI\u2019m a massive fan of the FA Cup; as a kid, watching the final in May was a huge day in the calendar for me and the excitement doesn\u2019t change,\u201d he says. Yet when Carrick is asked whether he is tempted to field a weaker team against Brighton he does not contradict that notion, instead merely body-swerving it. \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019ve got a weak team here,\u201d he smiles. \u201cI\u2019m delighted with everybody. \u201cBrighton are a really terrific team, especially in possession, and I\u2019m looking forward to seeing what we do against them when we have the ball. I want to beat Brighton; seeing if you\u2019re good enough to pull it off on big occasions is what you\u2019re in football for. But the measurement for us now is the league and where we end up. It\u2019s all about where we finish the season.\u201d Given that Boro were 22nd at the time of Wilder\u2019s departure the 12-point gap separating them from the second automatic promotion place occupied by Sheffield United is regarded as distinctly surmountable on Teesside. If Boro do go up, Carrick\u2019s decision to appoint Jonathan Woodgate as his first-team coach will have been fully vindicated. Considering Woodgate was sacked as Boro\u2019s manager and replaced by Neil Warnock two-and-a-half years ago it initially looked a slightly left-field recruitment but he and Carrick are tactical soulmates. The former international teammates share a longstanding friendship and Woodgate\u2019s inside knowledge of the squad has proved invaluable. Significantly, the former centre back, who won eight England caps, is credited with helping Dael Fry and Darragh Lenihan forge a formidabledefensive partnership. Both players, Fry especially, had fallen out of favour under Wilder but where Boro\u2019s former manager could be abrasively critical of individuals, Carrick and Woodgate prefer a more emollient, arm-around-the-shoulder approach. Long-serving club staff have been greatly impressed by the manager\u2019s \u201ccalmness\u201d and distinctly non-starry \u201chumility\u201d. High standards are demanded but individuals are spoken to with the sort of sensitivity perhaps informed by Carrick\u2019s experience of a two-year period with depression during his playing days.  \u201cI don\u2019t know what went on before but the boys have been great since we started,\u201d says Carrick, who signed the striker Cameron Archer on loan from Aston Villa on Friday. \u201cThey\u2019re prepared to listen and apply themselves. When we\u2019ve tweaked things they\u2019ve responded. Everybody understands that successful teams are not about individuals. The attitude and application have been absolutely spot on.\u201d Boro\u2019s new passing game has brought out the best in the 20-year-old academy graduate Hayden Hackney and the ability of Zack Steffen, the United States goalkeeper on loan from Manchester City, to serve as a \u201csweeper-keeper\u201d is integral to the hallmark build-from-the-back philosophy. Carrick has retained the slender, straight-backed elegance which characterised his playing days but he appreciates he cannot be too rigid, let alone evangelistic, about the team\u2019s modus operandi. \u201cI want to see free-flowing attacking football and we\u2019ve played some really good, easy-on-the-eye stuff but what pleases me is that it hasn\u2019t all been like that,\u201d he says. \u201cIn sticky situations we\u2019ve done all sorts; it\u2019s particularly pleasing that we can find a way to win when we have to.\u201d"

                    "body": "The president of the Comoros Football Association has claimed that members of the country\u2019s team \u201ccheated\u201d by playing at last year\u2019s Africa Cup of Nations after testing positive for Covid.\nComoros defied expectations at their first Afcon finals by reaching the last 16 after eliminating Ghana thanks to a thrilling 3-2 victory in their final group match. The team were forced to field an outfield player in goal for their knockout tie against Cameroon after 11 squad members tested positive for Covid, but president Said All Said Athouman has said some of them had also shown positive results before the meeting with the Black Stars but played regardless.\nSpeaking at his wedding ceremony in Moroni at the start of January, where the Cameroon FA (Fecafoot) president, Samuel Eto\u2019o, was a guest, Athouman was attempting to show support for the former Barcelona forward after accusations that Cameroon, the Afcon hosts, had used Covid-19 tests to weaken prospective opponents. Eto\u2019o previously dismissed such suggestions, pointing out the testing was conducted by the Confederation for African Football (Caf).\n\n\u201cWe also cheated against Ghana so it\u2019s time to stop this useless polemic about my friend Eto\u2019o,\u201d said Athouman in a speech that has been posted on Facebook and widely shared. \u201cLet\u2019s stop whining and move on. Contrary to what is said, and I do not want to go into details, we accused the Caf and Fecafoot. Against Ghana, I say it and repeat it, we had positive cases of Covid but we still managed to get them to play.\u201d\nAsked to clarify his comments, Athouman told the Guardian: \u201cWhen our players tested positive against Ghana they repeated tests which were negative and other medical examinations which allowed them to play. In fact I am embarrassed and saddened to see that Eto\u2019o and the Cameroonians are unjustly accused. Maybe some have misinterpreted what I said, but I can\u2019t let people unfairly accuse football players because it can happen to me too.\u201d\nA spokesperson from Caf said: \u201cPCR tests at Afcon were done by an independent company from Switzerland. Results were sent to a doctor \u2013 a Caf Covid officer \u2013 and this person worked with the teams to ensure that only players who test negative and comply with Caf Covid protocols play. Only Caf tests were considered.\u201d\nThe defender Chaker Alhadhur started in goal as Comoros were beaten 2-1 by Cameroon in the last-16 after 11 of the squad had been ruled out by positive Covid tests.\n\u201cThe rules of the game are known to everyone before the competition started and I really wish, humbly, that my country is respected,\u201d said Eto\u2019o at the time. \u201cIt is not fair to insinuate things, to accuse the Cameroonian government, to accuse myself.\u201d"

                    "body": "  6.16am   Three on the bounce  England chalk up their third win on the reel to edge into fourth place in the overall standings. They\u2019ve given themselves a decent shot of making the semi-finals. Who would have given them odds for that just a few short weeks ago after having tanked in their opening three matches?  No team has gone on to win a World Cup after chalking up two (or more!) losses in their first couple of games, Heather Knight\u2019s side could make history. But let\u2019s not get carried away, they still have to do the business against Bangladesh at the weekend. And there\u2019s the small matter of an unbeaten Australian juggernaut looming ominously on the horizon.  Pakistan were poor with the bat, never recovering from losing a wicket to the first ball of the match and a failure to rotate the strike throughout their innings meant that England were never under any pressure. Even the blisteringly good early bowling from Diana Baig at the start of their response wasn\u2019t enough to curtail them for long.  The England camp will be heartened to see Katherine Brunt back in the wickets and Danni Wyatt the runs as they head into the sharp end of the tournament. Their consistent performers - Kate Cross, Sophie Ecclestone and Knight herself all showed their class once more.  That\u2019s all from me. Thanks for your company and see you for another OBO very soon.  Goodbye!  Updated at 6.19am GMT    6.00am         5.49am    England won with 30 overs to spare and so they sneak into fourth place in the table, just ahead of India. The big question is can they stay there and secure a semi-final spot?    Updated at 5.52am GMT    5.47am   England win by nine wickets!  Wyatt helps a leg side ball to the boundary and England have made quick work of that chase! The opening batter is immediately awarded POTM for her sparkling 72* off 66 balls. 19.2 overs: England 107-1 (Wyatt 72*, Knight 24*)     5.40am    19th over: England 102-1 (Wyatt 72, Knight 24) Shot! Wyatt plays a lofted drive in-to-out over the covers for four. She\u2019s looked better as this innings has gone on. England pilfer 8 runs from the over and need just 4 more runs to wrap up a thumping win.      5.36am    18th over: England 94-1 (Wyatt 67, Knight 21) Nearly all over now! Wyatt helps herself to ten runs from the over - a full toss from Dar is gladly thwocked to the fence and a full ball is lofted down the ground for four more. A couple more follow off a deft sweep. Lovely innings this from Wyatt. 12 needed for England.     5.33am    17th over: England 84-1 (Wyatt 57, Knight 21) A deft paddle from Knight brings her three runs to fine leg. Wyatt picks up a couple, cutting and flicking. 22 runs needed.      5.27am    16th over: England 78-1 (Wyatt 56, Knight 16) Nida Dar twirls away and Wyatt is charging down to flat bat her in the air, the ball creeping over the head of mid-off and landing safe. Next up, Wyatt clubs into the leg side to pick up two to deep square-leg. England in a hurry here.      5.24am         5.23am    15th over: England 72-1 (Wyatt 50, Knight 16) Fifty for Danni Wyatt! Well batted. She\u2019s played her shots (7 fours) and taken risks, breaking the back of this run chase before any real pressure was allowed to build. Decent time to hit form too. Sandhu continues around the wicket and keeps Knight honest. 15 overs done, England need just 34 runs from 35 overs.      5.18am    14th over: England 71-1 (Wyatt 49, Knight 16) fifty partnership for Wyatt and Knight, they\u2019ve been clinical here. Job two thirds done.      5.16am    13th over: England 66-1 (Wyatt 45, Knight 15) Nashra Sandhu is on to bowl some spin. England content to milk 5 runs from her first over.      5.12am    12th over: England 61-1 (Wyatt 41, Knight 14) Aliya Riaz is into the attack with her somewhat slooow slingers. Knight works her first ball away for three runs, a couple of singles precede a brace of wides chucked well outside the tramlines. Not the best change this for Pakistan. The pressure well and truly off. Three more singles and it\u2019s ten taken, easily, from the over.      5.08am    11th over: England 51-1 (Wyatt 38, Knight 9) Baig continues, Knight picks up a single with a dab to backward point and Wyatt gives the charge... she doesn\u2019t get it, the ball plugs in the verdant turf, but it brings a couple. Fifty up for England.      5.03am    10th over: England 48-1 (Wyatt 36, Knight 8) Anwer drops short again and Wyatt smears her through mid-wicket again. Four more. Great little cameo this from Wyatt, she\u2019s getting runs and settling English nerves. An edge then flies past the keeper for four more, streaky but Wyatt won\u2019t mind - she\u2019s rattled along to 36 from 32 balls. A couple of singles make it ten from the tenth.      4.58am    9th over: England 38-1 (Wyatt 27, Knight 7) Knight gets a single and Wyatt flays Baig\u2019s final ball away for three more. England batting positively in spite of the tight bowling from Baig.      4.56am         4.54am    8th over: England 34-1 (Wyatt 24, Knight 4) Wyatt continues to play aggressively, she gives a full ball outside off stump an absolute clobbering - SMACK! That\u2019s the hardest hit shot of the day so far, or at least it sounded it, the ball racing away to the fence too.      4.51am    7th over: England 30-1 (Wyatt 20, Knight 4) Baig bowls two jaffas to Heather Knight, pitched up and zipping past the edge. You\u2019d do well to edge either of those, Skip. Knight then leans on a slightly fuller one to pick up a welcome two into the covers. The final ball is speared in full and Knight does well to jam the blade down on it. Yeeesh. Some opening spell this from Baig.      4.47am    6th over: England 28-1 (Wyatt 20, Knight 4) Aiman Anwer into her work. Knight rocks back and punches into the gap to bring up three through the covers. Wyatt then climbs into a short ball and clatters it away into the leg-side for four.      4.42am    5th over: England 21-1 (Wyatt 16, Knight 1) Baig squares up Heather Knight with her first delivery, the ball hooping, taking the edge and squirting away for a single. Pakistan have got their dander up here, no doubt sensing some nerves in the England camp.      4.38am   Wicket! Beaumont lbw b Baig 2 (England 20-1)  Beaumont plays around a straight one and is given out on review!     4.36am    4th over: England 20-0 (Beaumont 2, Wyatt 16) Drop! Wyatt is put down at backward point by Nida Dar. A diving chance but the fielder had it in her grasp... until she landed and the ball plopped out onto the turf. Wyatt responds with three consecutive boundaries! The first - a short armed jab behind square is followed by an aerial drive in the gap and a tickle off the hips to fine leg. 12 runs off the over.      4.31am    3rd over: England 6-0 (Beaumont 2, Wyatt 2) Baig beats Wyatt with a peach first up. Wyatt then picks up a single thanks to a misfield in the ring. Baig looks threatening, again whirring one past the edge, Beaumont this time drawn in to playing.      4.26am    2nd over: England 5-0 (Beaumont 2, Wyatt 1) Fatima Sana begins from around the wicket. Touching 64mph in her first over. Wyatt squeezes one away down to third man to get her knock started. Tight lines from the seamer. Just a couple from it.      4.22am    1st over: England 3-0 (Beaumont 1, Wyatt 0) Hint of movement from Baig. Beaumont drops and runs to get off the mark. The seamer then loses her radar with a couple of wides down the leg-side. But also beats Wyatt with one on the angle.      4.20am    South Africa qualify. Just two more semi-final spots up for grabs. England will want to do this quickly and keep their NRR looking healthy in case of any mathematical shenanigans down the line.       4.17am    It\u2019s gone a bit gloomy in Christchurch as the clouds have rolled on. The players are out on the park, under lights. Danni Wyatt and Tammy Beaumont will get the chase under way for England. Diana Baig has the ball for Pakistan. It looks as though it will swing given the conditions. Pakistan need to make early inroads.      3.58am         3.57am         3.55am    Katherine Brunt speaks: \u201cIt\u2019s no mystery that I\u2019ve been struggling recently for form but that\u2019s sport in general. I\u2019m just really happy that I turned up and contributed today\u201d.  She set the tone with a wicket off the very first ball of the game.   Updated at 3.55am GMT    3.51am   WICKET! Baig is bowled by Ecclestone for 6...  Pakistan are all out for 105. England were very good with the ball there, clinical, clever and didn\u2019t let Pakistan off the hook once they had them on the ropes. I\u2019m mixing my metaphors but it is ten to four in the AM.  Back soon for the CHASE!     3.47am    41st over: Pakistan 105-9 (Baig 6, Sandhu 1) Cross nearly finishes it off but Nat Sciver can\u2019t quite get to a catch that is spooned up into the leg side by Baig.      3.44am    40th over: Pakistan 102-9 (Baig 4, Sandhu 0) Ton up for Pakistan. For the cost of nine wickets. Ah.      3.42am   WICKET! Aiman Anwer ct Jones b Ecclestone 0 (Pakistan 102-9)  Another one gone! Anwer gets a tiny tickle through to Amy Jones who takes a fine catch stood up to the stumps. Excellent finish here from England.      3.40am    39th over: Pakistan 99-8 (Baig 0, Aiman Anwar 0) Cross has 1-16 from her seven overs.      3.38am   Wicket! Sidra b Cross 23 (Pakistan 99-8)  Kate Cross removes leg stump with an in-ducker! She\u2019s deserved that. Two more wickets needed for England to finish Pakistan off.      3.35am   Wicket! Fatima Sana ct Jones b Ecclestone 4 (Pakistan 95-7)  Ecclestone snares her first! She gets one to turn and Sana goes for an expansive stroke but just manages to get a feint edge which is well snaffled by Amy Jones stood up to the stumps.  38th over: Pakistan 95-7 (Sidra 20, Baig 0)     3.31am    37th over: Pakistan 94-6 (Sidra 19, Fatima Sana 4) Just a couple from Knight\u2019s over. England happy to speed through the overs here for very little damage.      3.29am    36th over: Pakistan 92 -6 (Sidra 18, Fatima Sana 3) A maiden from Ecclestone. On the button.      3.27am    35th over: Pakistan 92 -6 (Sidra 18, Fatima Sana 3) Better over for Pakistan, five off Knight. Can they eke their way to a tricksy little total and put some pressure back on England with the ball?      3.24am    34th over: Pakistan 87-6 (Sidra 14, Fatima Sana 2) A couple and a wide off Ecclestone. This England pair are rattling through the overs.   Updated at 3.25am GMT    3.22am    33rd over: Pakistan 84-6 (Sidra 13, Fatima Sana 1) A streaky four and a single off the remainder of Knight\u2019s over.   Updated at 3.24am GMT    3.19am   Wicket Aliya Riaz c Shrubsole b Knight 9 (Pakistan 79-6)  Heather Knight brings herself on for a bowl and she is gifted a wicket with her second ball! Riaz sweeps tamely straight into the hands of Anya Shrubsole on the \u201845.      3.17am    32nd over: Pakistan 78-5 (Aliya Riaz 9, Sidra 8) Two singles and a leg bye off Ecclestone. None of which hurt England.      3.13am    31st over: Pakistan 75-5 (Aliya Riaz 8, Sidra 7) Sciver starts back after lunch and there\u2019s just a single taken.  Kettle on, toes un-stubbed. Silence. Success.      3.10am    30th over: Pakistan 74-5 (Aliya Riaz 8, Sidra 6) Three singles off Ecclestone. 30 overs done. Drinks. I\u2019m going to pad down the way in my slippers, past the baby\u2019s room, hopefully avoiding all the unseen trip hazards hidden in the dark, to put the kettle on. Wish me luck.  Probably not too dissimilar to this. No Connery ogling here though.      3.02am    29th over: Pakistan 71-5 (Aliya Riaz 7, Sidra 4) Riaz drives uppishly but gets four. Sciver chastises herself for giving too much width outside off, overcompensating for a leg-side wide first up. The rest of the over is full o\u2019dots though.      2.59am    28th over: Pakistan 65-5 (Aliya Riaz 3, Sidra 4) Ecclestone, plait swaying in the breeze. Just two singles and a leg-side wide.      2.56am    Meanwhile...      2.56am    Covid restrictions lifted in New Zealand and nice to see decent crowds in:       2.56am    27th over: Pakistan 62-5 (Aliya Riaz 2, Sidra 3) Sciver takes over from Brunt... and starts with a maiden.      2.54am    26th over: Pakistan 62-5 (Aliya Riaz 2, Sidra 3)The World\u2019s Number One Bowler - Sophie Ecclestone is on for a twirl and it\u2019s the first sight of spin. Riaz and Sidra seem to be busier at the crease, looking to rotate strike and keep the scoreboard ticking. Three from Ecclestone\u2019s first.   Updated at 2.54am GMT    2.51am    25th over: Pakistan 59-5 (Aliya Riaz 1, Sidra 1) Sidra Nawaz joins Aliya Riaz at the crease, the two new batters need to get a partnership going to give their bowlers something to work with or else England are going to canter this.   Updated at 2.54am GMT    2.48am   Wicket! Amin b Brunt 32 (Pakistan 58-5)  Brunt has three as she sneaks one through Amin (between a sizeable gap between bat and pad in fairness) to send the bails skywards! Pakistan lose their set batter too. All sorts of strife for them here.   Updated at 2.48am GMT    2.44am    24th over: Pakistan 53-4 (Amin 28, Aliya Riaz 0) Pakistan hit a boundary! First runs in 19 balls and first boundary in 55. Still, credit where it\u2019s due, a nice whip away from Amin to the mid-wicket rope. Five dots make up the rest of Cross\u2019 over. Pakistan unable to rotate strike, it\u2019s tough going for them at the moment.      2.39am   Wicket! Dar b Brunt 4 (Pakistan 53-4)  Something did give! Brunt joins the dots with her first three balls and then pins Dar in front as the batter goes down onto her haunches to try and sweep the ball away but it is just too full. A review confirms it as Umpires Call and so remains out!  A wicket maiden for Brunt. England all over this.  23rd over: Pakistan 53-4 (Amin 28, Aliya Riaz 0)     2.34am    22nd over: Pakistan 53-3 (Amin 28, Dar 4) Kate Cross does her thing. DotDotDotDotDot and... Dot. Death by Dots. Dotageddon. We do DotDotDot Kate, we do DOTDOT. Something\u2019s gotta give soon huh? I\u2019m going dotty.      2.29am    21st over: Pakistan 53-3 (Amin 28, Dar 4) Brunt is back into the attack for another burst, she keeps it tight, just a couple picked up from the over.       2.25am    20th over: Pakistan 51-3 (Amin 27, Dar 3) Still no boundary to break the shackles, Cross will bowl and bowl and bowl and bowl here, blotting up an end as is her wont.      2.22am    19th over: Pakistan 48-3 (Amin 24, Dar 1) England have 9 fielders inside the ring but Pakistan can\u2019t put any pressure back onto the fielding side by going over the top. Just a couple off Sciver\u2019s latest. The run rate is only a smidge over 2.5.      2.19am    18th over: Pakistan 46-3 (Amin 24, Dar 1) After 15 dots in a row Dar scores a single for her side and gets off the mark in the process. More intent from the batters as they scamper a two and take a well judged quick single off the last.      2.15am    17th over: Pakistan 42-3 (Amin 21, Dar 0) Sciver makes it back to back maidens. Miserly stuff from England since drinks.      2.13am    16th over: Pakistan 42-3 (Amin 21, Dar 0) Kate Cross joins the attack and she is straight into her accurate and wily ways, keeping new batter Nida Dar honest with a maiden.   Updated at 2.15am GMT    2.10am    15th over: Pakistan 42-3 (Amin 21, Dar 0) Amin plays the shot of the day so far, a straight drive back past Nat Sciver for four! And another! A cover drive this time. Beautiful batting. And that\u2019s drinks. England will enjoy their slurp of high performance liquid the most.   Updated at 2.15am GMT    2.05am   Wicket! Sohail run out Beaumont 11 (Pakistan 33-3)  Tammy Beaumont swoops at mid-off and pings the stumps with a diving direct hit. There wasn\u2019t a run on really, Sohail has to go this time!      1.58am    13th over: Pakistan 33-2 (Amin 12, Sohail 11) Drop! In fact, trade-descriptions would have something to say to the two Sophs - Dunkley and Ecclestone - as they both stare at each other as a dolly from Sohail plops down between them. Either of them could have caught it one handed and have time to high five the other or play a round of rock, paper, scissors. A bit of sloppiness creeping in for England.      1.52am    12th over: Pakistan 31-2 (Amin 11, Sohail 10) Shrubsole continues, after three dots Sohail advances down the wicket to try and loft her away but doesn\u2019t really get a decent connection, the ball looping over the fielders. Run out chance! Dunkley pulls off a neat stop in the covers but throws to the wrong end from her sprawled position on the floor. A let off for Pakistan.      1.47am    11th over: Pakistan 29-2 (Amin 10, Sohail 9) These two batters are re-building nicely after that double clatter early on. Just a single off Sciver\u2019s first. The runs are not hurting England (yet) though.       1.43am    10th over: Pakistan 28-2 (Amin 10, Sohail 8) Ten overs reeled off in no time. Powerplay done and dusted, Nat Sciver is coming on for a whirl.      1.40am         1.39am    9th over: Pakistan 27-2 (Amin 10, Sohail 7)Shot! Amin down on one knee to peel off a classical cover drive against Brunt. No need to run for that. Brunt keeps it full though, looking to exploit this early movement. Nothing more doing off the over.      1.35am    8th over: Pakistan 23-2 (Amin 6, Sohail 7) Shrubsole sends down an absolute beauty that beats everything! Full and straightens at the last to whizz past the outside edge and pass within a sweet nothing of the off stump. Just a single off the over.      1.33am    7th over: Pakistan 22-2 (Amin 5, Sohail 7) Two slips still in place. Brunt takes the edge again but it goes straight down off Amin\u2019s bat and trickles away between said slips. Three runs. Brunt is full and zoning in on stumps and knee roll. This is the best she has bowled all tournament.      1.28am    6th over: Pakistan 19-2 (Amin 2, Sohail 7) Omaina Sohail gets off the mark with a nice looking drive that pulls up just short of the rope, the outfield is lush and a little slow. Pakistan pick up three. Sohail unfurls another drive and this is timed more sweetly than the last, beating a diving Beaumont to the fence for four. Lovely shot (s).     1.24am    5th over: Pakistan 11-2 (Amin 1, Sohail 0) Brunt has it on a string. Six dots. A maiden.      1.23am   Wicket! Bismah run out Jones/Dunkley 9 (Pakistan 11-2)  England have looked sprightly in the field and well and truly up for this match, Bismah tries to come back for a risky second run but some quick work by Amy Jones scampering after the ball and Sophie Dunkley at the stumps sees her run out by half a foot. Or a full foot. Depending on how big your feet are. Ah Ian Smith on comms reckons it was four inches. Let\u2019s go with that.  4th over: Pakistan 11-2 (Amin 1, Sohail 0)     1.17am    3rd over: Pakistan 8-1 (Amin 1, Bismah 6) Brunt keeps it full and a second slip is brought in by the skipper. Good attacking cricket from England. A drive for a couple and a flick away for a single from Bismah.      1.14am     ChuckleChuckleChuckle     1.13am    2nd over: Pakistan 5-1 (Amin 1, Bismah 3) Anya Shrubsole to start from t\u2019other end.... and she is getting vast amounts of swing through the air. Loads of the stuff. She keeps it full, enticing the drive. A couple off it.     1.09am    1st over: Pakistan 3-1 (Amin 0, Bismah 2) What a start for England. Brunt nearly has another too off the final ball of the over! Another knick but this time wide of a diving Knight in the slips. Get another one in there Heather! The ball looks to be moving around out there. I\u2019m awake. You?     1.03am   WICKET! Khan c Knight b Brunt 0 (Pakistan 0-1)  BRUNT GETS ONE WITH THE FIRST BALL OF THE MATCH! Full, a bit of nibble away and Nahida Khan pokes forward in front of her body and gets a thick edge to Heather Knight at slip! Brunt has arms outstretched. That\u2019ll do.      1.00am    The players have sung the anthems and done their huddles. Katherine Brunt has the new ball. Nahida Khan and Sidra Amin are opening up for Pakistan. Let\u2019s play!     12.58am      Updated at 1.10am GMT    12.57am    Emma Lamb in, Charlie Dean misses out for England.   Updated at 1.00am GMT    12.54am   England win the toss and will bowl first  Clear and bright in Christchurch but Heather Knight has spotted a smattering of \u2018live\u2019 grass on the wicket and chosen to ask Pakistan to have first dig.      12.52am   Preamble  Hello and welcome to the OBO of England vs Pakistan at Hagley Oval in Christchurch. It\u2019s another must win game for Heather Knight\u2019s side. The three early defeats in the tournament to Australia, West Indies and South Africa have seen them on the precipice, tip-toeing around the edge of elimination. Somehow they have managed to not topple off. A late wobble against New Zealand in their previous game, one in which they were coasting, laid bare their predicament \u2013 they simply can\u2019t afford any more slip ups. Think a trapeze artist over a pool of piranha or Indiana Jones on that rickety bridge above crocodile infested waters. One slip and it\u2019s goodbye. The gnashers could also then be out for a side that feels like it has been tottering towards the end of a cycle for a little while. Still, a win here against Pakistan and a prospering over Bangladesh in their final first-round game on Saturday will see England more or less certain of securing a semi final spot. That\u2019ll be some achievement considering how things began and from there, who knows? It\u2019s not as if teams haven\u2019t won World Cups without chucking in a few dud performances along the way, right? \u201cWe\u2019ve managed to turn it around a little bit but still haven\u2019t played our best cricket\u201d said Knight in the aftermath of the nerve-jangling win over New Zealand. \u201cWe feel like we\u2019re building. Our message at the beginning was \u2018it\u2019s not how you start at these tournaments, but how you finish.\u2019 Hopefully we can make that come true.\u201d Pakistan might be propping up the table but they are a talented side who will be buoyed by finally putting an end to an 18 match, 13 year, losing streak stretch in World Cups. Off-spinner Nida Dar twirled them to victory, snatching 4 wickets for just 10 runs in their weather-curtailed game against West Indies. England have won their last ten ODIs against Pakistan but with a World Cup and at least a few legacies on the line it promises to be an intriguing contest. As ever do get in touch with any musings, mutterings or mirth - I\u2019m \u2018doing the double\u2019 and will be here throughout the night from my lonely-yet-surprisingly-comfy-sofa-bed in South London. So far all I have for company is a full mug of coffee and a snoring 1year old. Neither will last that way for long. I\u2019ll be back with news of the teams and the toss shortly, play gets underway in Christchurch at 2pm local/1am GMT/12pm/AEDT.   "

                    "body": "Antonio Conte likes to talk about suffering. There is a limit to all things, however, and the suggestion of an unexpected appearance on the touchline on Sunday afternoon despite midweek surgery to relieve the unconscionable agony of an agitated gall bladder may be a step beyond even Conte\u2019s powers of defiance. Still there is something unavoidably resonant about the world\u2019s most gloweringly inflamed football manager having problems with an organ medieval science identified as the source of the choleric emotions: fury, aggression, ambition, impatience. This is what a year and a half of managing Tottenham will do to you. They got Antonio. They got his gall. Conte is not alone among his peers in experiencing distemper this season. Look back at last year\u2019s Premier League table and all of the top four coaches have suffered to some degree. Thomas Tuchel was sacked at Chelsea for the crime of not really understanding what Todd Boehly is up to. J\u00fcrgen Klopp is wrestling with an insidious case of squad decline. Conte has felt like a heavy presence at Spurs, griping and fuming and conducting his pre-failure reputation management in public.  But it is Pep Guardiola, his opposite number, as Manchester City travel to a stadium where they have never scored a goal in the league, who has enjoyed the most intriguing season so far. It is always a mistake to overplay the importance of Guardiola\u2019s frame of mind, to see doom-laden significance in his moods and fits of pique. An unhappy Guardiola is also a fully-functioning Guardiola. His entire career-long obsession, his serial triumphs, even the physical texture of his teams is built on anxiety, a lust for control, the endless picking away at details. The time to worry about Guardiola is when he goes cold. Successful seasons will bring gripes and bugbears. Right now it is the shipping out of Jo\u00e3o Cancelo, the word clouds of his public statements and the talk of hunger and motivation that define the current preoccupation. The assumption was that Guardiola\u2019s season would be spent fine-tuning the tactical shape around Erling Haaland, soldering this pure straight blade to the front of the City machine. This has happened. But in the foreground Guardiola has gone big on culture, body language, will, hunger, like the man who comes to fit your gleaming new Norwegian pine parquet floor, a perfect finish to the perfect project, and halfway though detects the first little twinge of wet rot in the beams. You can have the finish. But this lot? This lot is going to have to come out. Seven years into his City span, Pep has begun to strip it back. There is a kind of recklessness to this in the post-window wash as City travel to north London for one of the trickier steps in their pursuit of Arsenal. Shipping out the (at times) best full-back in the Premier League mid-season with no replacement because of vibes and feelings and personality clash might alarm some City fans. But it is part of a process. There is a minimalism to the squad these days.  Here is a list of key players who have left Manchester City since the summer of 2020: David Silva, Sergio Ag\u00fcero, Leroy San\u00e9, Fernandinho, Gabriel Jesus, Oleksandr Zinchenko, Nicol\u00e1s Otamendi. These are their replacements: Kalvin Phillips, Manuel Akanji, Haaland, Jack Grealish, Nathan Ak\u00e9 and R\u00faben Dias. The greater balance of mature champion quality is heading out, not in. The squad was always relatively small. It seems thinner now, a conscious act of paring back in search of something that feels true. It would be easy to suggest here that this is a case of Guardiola picking a fight with his own shadow, finding in culture-war talk a way to put himself at the centre of the story. There was certainly something gripping about Pep watching his sharper, sleeker team in action in early season, the theatrical interplay with the crowd during some of those early Haaland-driven wins, the sense of the world\u2019s greatest petrolhead finding himself suddenly behind the wheel of a self-driving car. Pep loves a puzzle, loves to unpick, loves to find solutions. What if this journey is suddenly only A to B in the straightest line? Hence the urge to see wider problems. Could this be Pep overthinking on an epic scale? A Champions League semi-final freak-out extended to cover an entire title race?  The answer is, of course: no. The overthinking stuff, the micro-complications have always only been another side of the success. Vast budgets aside, this is why Guardiola wins. Because he never stops, because he is prepared to be intellectually reckless with his systems and plans. Want to know how good he is? Compare him to his peers, to Conte who wants to make the same movie every time and finds himself gasping for air without the precise component parts. Or Klopp who has, with some tweaks, basically been delivering the same fist-pumping stadium anthems for the past five years. Guardiola\u2019s base note always stays the same: defence and attack based on possession; structure and pressing; maniacal fear of the counterattack. But the emphasis has changed every year. This is the sympathetic view of what Pep is doing now, learning from the metal fatigue at Liverpool. Albeit with the sense of a greater degree of choice here, that City can live like common people when it fits the plan, can cut their squad and promote the youth team, but a call to the recruitment committee could still stop it all.  Cancelo\u2019s departure has a kind of tactical logic. There has been a shift with Haaland in the team. If one part of your XI is all attack, other parts will have to become a little more defence. Do City still need to create space by overloading riskily in midfield, if the game is being refined to a simpler cutting edge? Cancelo is a classic Pep full-back for a classic Pep team. But this is not that. Haaland made him more dispensable. This raises its own questions about Sunday at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium. Spurs have been good against City in recent years. The angles of the classic Kane-era attack, Harry in the pocket, runners ahead, the diagonal attacking pass, has been well suited to City\u2019s tendency to vacate the full-back areas. These games have brought the best of Kane in recent years. Another performance like his masterclass at the Etihad a year ago could be a major step in a title win for north London, just not alas, one that involves Kane holding the trophy. But Sunday could be a little different. City are more reserved on the flanks, and less prone perhaps to that familiar Kane angle. Either way they will start as strong favourites to win for the first time at the re-geared amphitheatre. Tottenham have lost six of their past 11 in the league and five out of five this season against the current top four. There is an argument that Kane would have fitted the pre-existing City system better as it would have required less tinkering than for Haaland\u2019s sharper, thinner blade. Sunday is another chance to demonstrate that restlessness is also Guardiola\u2019s strength."

                    "body": "Dan Evans has said he is unsurprised by the demise of the Davis Cup\u2019s partnership with Kosmos, the investment group run by Gerard Piqu\u00e9, noting that the large sums of prize money offered to players and federations were unsustainable.\n\u201cIt is disappointing that they can\u2019t keep filling our pockets! It was a matter of time, wasn\u2019t it? We were getting paid a little too much for not a lot, I guess. But you get it while you can,\u201d said Evans.\n\nOn Thursday night, the International Tennis Federation confirmed that it would be cancelling its contract with Kosmos with immediate effect. The ITF and Kosmos had entered a 25-year agreement in 2018 with the group promising to invest $3bn and which led to the Davis Cup controversially changing format to a World Cup-style event and a finals week.\nSince its announcement, the deal had widely been predicted to be unsustainable financially. Kosmos attempted to renegotiate the contract but the ITF opted to cancel instead. As a result, while the event will continue with its planned format this year, the future of the Davis Cup is unclear.\nEvans says he would welcome the Davis Cup reverting to its earlier state, arguing that while the current legends and their generation had opted out of the previous iteration of the Davis Cup, most young players would be willing to play the competition in its previous home and away format.\n\n\u201cWe changed it when I don\u2019t think it necessarily needed the whole format changing. There\u2019s people out there who are pumped to play three out of five for three days and win the tournament and I\u2019d still be happy to do that,\u201d said Evans.\nMeanwhile, Jack Draper\u2019s excellent run in Adelaide came to an end on Friday as he was defeated 7-6 (8), 6-7 (2), 6-3 by Kwon Soon-woo of South Korea in a gruelling, tight semi-final. Draper will now head to Melbourne where he faces a quick turnaround before his marquee first-round match with the defending champion and top seed, Rafael Nadal.\n\u201cI\u2019ve only been on the tour for six months. It\u2019s easy to forget that, and people think I should be winning this, should be winning that. I put that expectation on myself, as well, but at the same time I know that I have to keep on learning and keep on growing at this level,\u201d said Draper.\nIn Auckland Cameron Norrie continued his strong start to the new season by defeating Jenson Brooksby 6-3, 6-4 to reach the final of the ASB Classic. Norrie will face Richard Gasquet as he looks to triumph in his former home country."

                    "body": "Stadium Australia has been the site for many of Australia\u2019s most celebrated moments. Be it Josh Kennedy\u2019s towering header to defeat Iraq and secure progression to the 2014 World Cup or Mile Jedinak\u2019s captain\u2019s hat-trick against Honduras in the 2018 World Cup qualification play-offs. Or, of course, John Aloisi\u2019s famous penalty that dispatched Uruguay and ended the nation\u2019s long, 32-year absence from football\u2019s grandest stage;. Stadium Australia has so often proved to be Australian football\u2019s field of dreams. In other words, one could not have picked a better venue for a Socceroos fixture which carried all the hallmarks of a cliched Hollywood epic; an outmanned and outgunned host nation with their backs to the wall fighting to defy the odds in a manner nobody expected them to. Graham Arnold had leaned into the narrative by declaring his side needed to \u201cfight\u201d against their foes, and assistant coach Rene Meulensteen, filling in on pre-match media duties as Arnold completed (another) Covid isolation period, joined in on the bromides when he declared that, more than anything, \u201ccourage will win us the game\u201d. It was all very stirring.  But courage does not win you football games. Goals do. And on Thursday evening, the Socceroos\u2019 hopes were dashed by Kaoru Mitoma\u2019s 89th-minute strike and subsequent winding run and the 94th-minute sealer for Japan that popped out of Mat Ryan\u2019s hand and rolled, slowly, into the back of the net. Perhaps it was fitting that effort, as well as Miki Yamane\u2019s cutback to find Mitoma for his first, seemingly took an age to slide across the wet surface at Stadium Australia. Plenty of time to reflect on a result that has now served to deliver a coup de gr\u00e2ce to Australia\u2019s hopes of automatic qualification for the World Cup that, almost as part of a collective coping exercise, had long since been discarded by the majority of the 41,852 fans who had made their way to Homebush. Though controversy will dog the decision to disallow a 25th-minute own goal which would have given Australia the lead for a foul on goalkeeper Sh\u016bichi Gonda, it was indicative that the hosts looked capable of doing any damage only from set pieces. On another night, perhaps one in which Takumi Minamino has his radar on, the Japanese could have had another four or five. Australia started looking devoid of ideas and, by the end of the contest, had exhausted even those. Regardless of what the Socceroos are able to accomplish in Saudi Arabia next week, they will be forced to qualify for a fifth straight World Cup through the gauntlet of the Asian and then the intercontinental play-off. It was a path they also had to tread to qualify for the 2018 tournament in Russia. Unlike that campaign, though, it will not be a two-legged play-off against a North or Central American nation that awaits them but, instead, a one-legged, do-or-die clash against a country from the powerhouse that is South America.   Conmebol\u2019s play-offs will also end in the coming days but, as it presently stands, that opponent would be 2018 World Cup opponents Peru. Or perhaps it will currently be sixth-placed Chile or even, just to add to the whole strangely scripted vibe the Socceroos campaign has come to possess, old foes Uruguay. Before then, however, they will need to defeat the third-placed finisher from Asia\u2019s other qualifying group \u2013 presently the United Arab Emirates \u2013 and that will be no sure thing. But whoever they face, they will certainly need to fashion some sort of inspiration. As while Japan can\u2019t be said to have played free-flowing, swashbuckling football, they were still able to win more territory and create more chances than their counterparts. The Socceroos were, it must be acknowledged, heavily undermanned, but that alone cannot explain away Thursday night\u2019s uninspiring performance."

The spoils are a meeting with Bristol City next in the storied old FA Cup.\nThat Brandon Thomas-Asante equaliser had broken the hearts of the Derbyshire club and their fans but this evening had a different feel: from the opening whistle there appeared only one victor and it was not the team from England\u2019s fifth tier. Who knows if these opponents will have to wait as long to meet again as they did before this tie, but Chesterfield can feel proud of their showing.\n\nThe replay was only the second time these clubs had met since 1948 \u2013 the 3-3 draw 10 days ago was the first \u2013 and it drew a sparse crowd, although 2,700 Spireites fans made the trip and enjoyed a singsong. A Jeff King free-kick from the left was their side\u2019s first real attack. It was repelled but Mike Jones collected and sprayed a classy ball right, only for West Brom to clear again.\nPaul Cook, whose team had not played since West Brom\u2019s visit, made three changes from that meeting. Carlos Corber\u00e1n introduced 10 new players from the Baggies\u2019 previous outing, a 3-2 win at Luton, which illustrated that Friday\u2019s visit to the Championship leaders, Burnley, was the Spaniard\u2019s priority in the quest for promotion. \u201cThat\u2019s a massive game \u2013 100%,\u201d he said.\nThe manager could, then, be even more delighted at the opening goal. Jake Livermore took possession, the ball reached John Swift, and the midfielder rifled past Lucas Covolan to the goalkeeper\u2019s right. As at the Technique Stadium, West Brom had the lead but it only upped the volume from those following the National League side, whose fun night out was led by an enthusiastic drummer.\nThe fare, though, could not have been be billed as top-drawer; Grady Diangana\u2019s surge along the right wing was followed by a step inside and him hammering a cross straight out of play. Better was his dash into Chesterfield\u2019s area to meet Tom Rogic\u2019s cute pass: only Covolan\u2019s reflexes in parrying low down kept the score at 1-0.\n\nA Chesterfield sequence that featured Armando Dobra finding Bailey Clements, whose ball in from the left had to be punched out by David Button, offered encouragement. As did a Liam Mandeville cross which Semi Ajayi had to head out moments later, plus a Dobra foray into the West Brom area: if the two-goal hero of the first match had not stayed on his feet when challenged, the referee, Tim Robinson, might have pointed to the penalty spot. Even so, when the players strolled off for the break Cook could credibly inform his men that the upset remained on.\n\u201cChesterfield, lalala, Chesterfield, lalala,\u201d was the greeting for those in green when the minnows began attacking the end where the singers congregated. West Brom, though, silenced them instantly. A ball in from Adam Reach came to King and he committed a serious howler: for an unfathomable reason he backheeled it across the area straight to Tom Rogic, who scooped the ball past Covolan. \u201cTo concede a second goal like that killed us,\u201d said Cook.\nThe knockout blow soon followed. After a Swift free-kick was palmed over by Covolan for a corner the same player dinked in the set piece from the left. The ball reached Livermore in space, and he smashed it into the net.\n\n\u201cThree-nil on the big day out,\u201d was the jocular ditty the travelling fans met this with. Swift, the one survivor from the win at Luton, was immediately taken off. Those in the away end could cheer a rare corner that had Jamie Grimes lurking but the chance for their captain to pull the trigger never arrived. Chesterfield ended by going close to a consolation: Ryheem Sheckleford crashed the ball past Button but not his bar before Jovan Malcolm made it 4-0.\nCorber\u00e1n said: \u201cIt\u2019s a positive result and continuing in the FA Cup is important.\u201d But Matt Phillips, who came on as a substitute, injured a quad and the manager suggested he will miss the match against Burnley. \u201cWe have to find a solution,\u201d Corber\u00e1n said of his first-choice midfielder."

                    "body": "Somewhere in a reinforced concrete bunker in the northern hemisphere, Paul Dempsey is still talking. He was talking long before you turned the television on and you can be sure he\u2019ll be talking long after you turn it off. He\u2019s got a list of names in front of him, stats and facts, reserves of time and patience that will outlast any human, living or dead. Here\u2019s Lautaro Mart\u00ednez, who has never scored a volley in October. Lays it off to Francesco Caputo, who owns four hats. That\u2019s Jackson Borck on the Sampdoria bench, who joined in the summer from Fighting Spiders in the Maltese Premier Division, whose next game you can catch on BT Sport 8 on Thursday at 11am. Now here\u2019s Denzel Dumfries, who has never tasted jam.  Yes: the commentators have taken over. And a very understated invasion it has been, too: a faceless army of interchangeable middle-aged men quietly sequestering our screens, demanding only the right to talk about the football, any football, for ever. I\u2019m talking Adam Summerton, Daniel Mann, Mark Scott, Joe Speight. I\u2019m talking Dan Parsons, Gary Taphouse, Tom Barraclough, Steve Bower. You wouldn\u2019t recognise them in the street. You probably didn\u2019t even notice I made two of them up. But they\u2019ve spent longer talking to you than many of your close family. At the same time, something strange seems to have happened to a noble profession that was once drenched in an irresistible sun-dappled glamour. Motson, Davies, Moore (and there were never more than three): these were the gods of the gantry, braving the midday Mexican heat and the bone-rattling Boxing Day chill. We were their rapt congregation, hanging on every word.  It\u2019s hard to recreate that wonder these days. Largely this is down to the sheer crushing volume of live football: not so much an event of national communion as an endless scroll of dead content, much of it delivered from a dark metal box somewhere in southern England in front of two blinking screens and a Pumpkin Caf\u00e9 cappuccino slowly going cold in its non-compostable cup. No wonder the narrators of this simulacrum sound increasingly drawn and forlorn, like prisoners in a dystopian police state trying to earn enough credits for their freedom. This is in no way to devalue the job of live broadcasting: a difficult and often thankless task that requires not just natural talent but \u2013 in the social media age \u2013 a depressingly thick skin. But it strikes me there is a whole unexplored aspect to this debate. The original football commentators emerged in an era when television was still a close cousin of radio, when the pictures were fuzzy and everyone needed a little help recognising which player was which. Does this still hold true in an age of 4K Ultra HD, names on shirts, augmented reality and overlay graphics? The technology exists to identify players with far greater accuracy and speed than a human commentator ever could. In which case, what purpose does the human serve? If you were starting football from scratch, would you still have these guys chattering away in the background? If not, what\u2019s the point of them now? There is a sincere and a cynical answer to this question. Any decent commentator will argue that their job is not simply to narrate but to contextualise: to tell the story and explain why it matters. The problem is that this is not really how we interact with football any more. Most people these days watch the game while doing something else: travelling, cooking, entertaining friends, scrolling through social media. In the second-screen age the commentator serves a subtly different function.  There is a bit in The Tempest where Prospero is making a long, rambling speech to Miranda when he suddenly blurts out: \u201cDost thou attend me?\u201d It\u2019s addressed to Miranda, but really it\u2019s addressed to the audience: \u201cHey, are you listening?\u201d This is the commentator\u2019s real job these days: to remind us when we need to run back from the kitchen. Over time different styles of commentary have sprung up, all furiously jostling for a niche in the attention economy. Commentary as an extension of pub banter. Catchphrase commentary. Overwrought, emotion-soaked commentary specifically geared towards the viral clip market. \u201cMILANESE! MAYHEM!\u201d Peter Drury will shout after a dramatic late winner. \u201cA SAN SIRO DRAMA TO END ALL DRAMAS!\u201d And you think: all right Peter, it\u2019s a 1-0 win in Europa League Group K. Let\u2019s not go overboard. There is a high degree of subjectivity here. Some of you clearly can\u2019t get enough of the football men talking (and for all the progress made, this remains an unforgivably white and male profession). Some of you will take comfort in a familiar voice. Some of you prefer shouting, some wit and whimsy. Some of you will be devotees of the YouTube watchalong, where you log in to watch a man with two million followers swearing at a screen. But for decades televised football has gone one way: more talking, more curation, more voices, more product. Somewhere in a splintered market, there may just be an audience out there for the very opposite: football without any commentary. Just a viewer, a screen and the seductive ambient noise of the game. A sparser broadcast, but one that feels all the more immersive as a result, as close to the live experience as it is possible to get. Football sounds amazing. Perhaps it\u2019s time we let it talk. \u2022 Jonathan Liew was named sports journalist of the year at the prestigious London Press Club awards."

                    "body": "A bitter February night at Griffin Park in 2007. A friendly between Nigeria and Ghana, as though such a thing were possible. Ghana had not beaten their neighbours in 15 years but when Nigerian defences cracked, they collapsed. It was 0-0 at half-time but then Laryea Kingson, Sulley Muntari and Junior Agogo struck between the 50th and 60th minutes. It was a lot less than 10 minutes of playing time given the gleeful pitch invasions that followed each goal. The game finished 4-1, well over an hour later than scheduled, thanks to a delayed start for a larger than expected crowd and the frequent interruptions (a personal confession: I queued for more than an hour at an overwhelmed press entrance with the Observer\u2019s then-sports editor Brian Oliver, before giving up and hopping over a barrier, ripping my coat as I did so).  In his final game as Nigeria coach before being replaced by Berti Vogts, Augustine Eguavoen just about retained his dignity in a ferocious post-match press conference. For 15 minutes the Nigerian media tore into him before he called a halt by suggesting that because the Ghana coach, Claude Le Roy, who had been awkwardly sitting alongside him throughout, had turned 59 the previous day, everybody should sing \u201chappy birthday\u201d, which they lustily did. It was a night of unforgettable and glorious chaos, but in hindsight perhaps the most memorable aspect was the Ghanaian radio commentator whose voice dominated the press box. \u201cMore than 15 years! More than 15 years!\u201d he bellowed at the final whistle. \u201cIt will be more than 15 years before they beat us again.\u201d He was right. Nigeria have not beaten Ghana since. But more than 15 years have passed and as the two great rivals prepare for Friday\u2019s first leg of their World Cup qualifying play-off, it is Ghana who look to be in an even bigger mess than Nigeria. The intertwined sporting histories of the nations began in the 1930s, before either existed in their present form, with \u2018inter-colonial\u2019 events in football, boxing and tennis. When Ethel Jacks became African women\u2019s table-tennis champion in 1964, she was competing as a Ghanaian; 12 years later, when she finally surrendered her crown, she was representing the land of her birth, Nigeria. The Cudgoe brothers were born in Ghana but played football for Nigeria. Alex Quist and his brother Anthony at various times played football and cricket for both nations against the other. The Kwame Nkrumah leadership in Ghana (or the Gold Coast, as it then was) soon recognised the propaganda potential of sport and matches against Nigeria, who were still perceived as playing sport in \u201cthe effete English manner\u201d \u2013 to quote an editorial in the Nigerian daily Vanguard \u2013 began to take on additional edge.  Ghana quickly established themselves as the major power of west African football, players such as Wilberforce Mfum and Opoku Afriyie helping them to three Cups of Nations before Nigeria, emerging from civil war, claimed their first, in 1980. Two years later, as though making a point, Ghana won it again. In Barcelona in 1992, Ghana became the first African country to win a football medal at the Olympics; four years later in Atlanta, Nigeria took gold. Nigeria\u2019s performances at the 1994 and 1998 World Cups won global appreciation and meant they were unquestionably the best side in west Africa, despite politics preventing them from competing at the 1996 and 1998 Cups of Nations. Until 2006, the familiar taunt from Nigeria fans was that Ghana had never qualified for a World Cup, although that was largely because of a lack of African representation at the tournament before 1982. Twice, in 1960 and 1972, Ghana had beaten Nigeria in World Cup qualifiers \u2013 the latter victory coming after rioting in Lagos forced the game to be abandoned with five minutes remaining. This latest chapter in the rivalry comes after Ghana suffered an embarrassing Cup of Nations campaign in Cameroon. Milovan Rajevac, who had led Ghana to the final of the tournament in 2010, was mysteriously appointed coach in September but as even the president of the Ghana Football Association Kurt Okraku acknowledged, he had little time to work with his squad. The result was a series of dismal performances culminating in a 3-2 defeat to Comoros that eliminated them in the group stage. Rajevac was promptly sacked.  Chris Hughton was named as technical director, although exactly where his role ends and that of the interim coach, Otto Addo, begins is unclear. That is only the beginning of the confusion, with Andr\u00e9 Ayew and Benjamin Tetteh suspended and Jordan Ayew testing positive for Covid, although he was included in the squad that was finally announced in the early hours of Tuesday morning, after a planned Monday launch on the controversial GFA app was abandoned. The first leg had initially been scheduled for the 20,000-capacity Cape Coast Sports Stadium and there had been some talk that after the draw the GFA had wanted to move to a larger arena, only to be thwarted by CAF regulations that venues have to be set a minimum 90 days in advance. Independence Day celebrations staged by the Ghana government on 6 March damaged the pitch to such an extent that despite the release of some optimistically Photoshopped images CAF has agreed the game can be switched to the 40,000-capacity Baba Yara Stadium in Kumasi.  Nigeria\u2019s chaos is relatively low-key by comparison. Gernot Rohr was sacked as coach on 13 December, after which the president of the Nigerian Football Federation, Amaju Pinnick, announced that the Portuguese coach Jos\u00e9 Peseiro, who was supposed to be attached to the team at the Cup of Nations in an observer\u2019s role, would take over. But Peseiro was not in Cameroon and it turned out his contract might not be quite as signed as Pinnick had intimated so the interim who led Nigeria to a last-16 exit stays on: Augustine Eguavoen, implausibly, finds himself facing Ghana again with the chance to put right what went wrong in Brentford 15 years ago. And it\u2019s not Hughton\u2019s or Addo\u2019s birthday any time soon."

                    "body": "The Wisconsin senator Ron Johnson refused to say Republicans planning investigations of Hunter Biden for profiting from his connection to the presidency should also investigate Jared Kushner, Donald Trump\u2019s son-in-law and adviser who secured a $1.2bn loan from Qatar while working in the White House.  \u201cI\u2019m concerned about getting to the truth,\u201d Johnson insisted. \u201cI don\u2019t target individuals.\u201d Republicans are undoubtedly targeting Hunter Biden, for allegedly making money thanks to his father, Joe Biden. In the House, newly under GOP control, committees have promised investigations. Appearing on NBC\u2019s Meet the Press on Sunday, Johnson focused his own fire on the president\u2019s surviving son. The host, Chuck Todd, said: \u201cSenator, do you have a crime that you think Hunter Biden committed because I\u2019ve yet to see anybody explain. It is not a crime to make money off of your last name.\u201d Johnson referred to investigations pursued with Chuck Grassley, a Republican senator from Iowa, and a report written by a Trump-aligned group which Johnson said \u201cdetail[ed] all kinds of potential crimes\u201d involving Joe Biden\u2019s son. Todd said: \u201cLet me stop you there. \u2018Potential\u2019. This is potential. Potential is innuendo.\u201d Johnson said: \u201cIs it a crime to be soliciting and purchasing prostitution in potentially European sex trafficking operations? Is that a crime? Because Chuck Grassley and I laid out about $30,000 paid by Hunter Biden to those types of individuals over December of 2018, 2019, about $30,000. \u201cThat\u2019s about the same time that President Biden offered to pay about $100,000 of Hunter Biden\u2019s bills. I mean \u2026 that\u2019s just some information. I don\u2019t know exactly if it\u2019s a crime.\u201d Hunter Biden is known to be under investigation over his tax affairs. He has denied wrongdoing. His struggles with addiction have been widely discussed, not least in his memoir. He has not been charged with any crime. On Sunday, after some back and forth over what Johnson said was media bias against Republicans \u2013 a key focus of the new GOP House \u2013 Todd said: \u201cSenate Democrats want to investigate Jared Kushner\u2019s loan from the Qatari government when he was working in the [US] government negotiating many things in the Middle East. \u201cAre you not as concerned about that? \u2026 I say that because it seems to me if you\u2019re concerned about what Hunter Biden did, you should be equally outraged about what Jared Kushner did.\u201d Johnson paused, then said: \u201cI\u2019m concerned about getting to the truth. I don\u2019t target individuals.\u201d Todd said: \u201cYou don\u2019t? You\u2019re targeting Hunter Biden multiple times on this show, senator. You\u2019re targeting an individual.\u201d  Johnson said: \u201cChuck, you know \u2026 part of the problem, and this is pretty obvious to anybody watching this, is you don\u2019t invite me on to interview me. You invite me on to argue with me. You know, I\u2019m just trying to lay out the facts that certainly Senator Grassley and I uncovered.  \u201cThey were suppressed. They were censored. [The FBI] interfered in the 2020 election. Conservatives understand that. Unfortunately, liberals and the media don\u2019t. And part of the reasons are our politics are inflamed, is we do not have an unbiased media. We don\u2019t. It\u2019s unfortunate. I\u2019m all for a free press.\u201d After more cross-talk, Todd said: \u201cLook, you can go back on your partisan cable cocoon and talk about media bias all you want. I understand it\u2019s part of your identity.\u201d The interview moved on to Johnson\u2019s connections to Trump\u2019s attempt to overturn the 2020 election and links between Trump advisers and the abortive coup in Brazil. The conversation ended with host and senator talking over each other again."

                    "body": "  4.56am    Australia have made an absolute mockery of the competition at this tournament. On the weekend, after that World Cup-record chase of 277 against India, Alyssa Healy said her side could win from any position. This match has confirmed her words. There were a couple of jittery moments early in Australia\u2019s innings, when Healy fell in the third over and another two walked before the 20th was out. But even then, and even without Perry at No 4, there came a point when it was never in doubt. Lanning will go down as one of the greats of the game of any gender, as highlighted by the below match report, which I leave with you. Thanks for joining us and we\u2019ll see you for the next one.      4.47am    And so, that\u2019s that. South Africa did not play badly. Apart from their fielding mishaps it was quite the contrary. They played well, and were still outplayed. They are capable and anything can happen in the knockout stages. Up next for the Proteas are India on Saturday while Australia face Bangladesh on Thursday.     4.40am    Unsurprisingly, Lanning is player of the match with her 135 off 130 balls. In her career she now has 10 centuries while chasing from 53 matches. Her innings in this one was close to perfect. \u201cIt was nice to contribute,\u201d she says. \u201cWe speak of the top four batting through and playing those match-winning innings. I thought Kapp and Ismail bowled really well. I felt I left more balls than I ever have. It was important ... I knew I had to be the one to bat through today. Mooney and Tahlia took the pressure off me as well.\u201d     4.29am   Australia beat South Africa by five wickets!  Sutherland does it on the second ball of the over. She flicks Khaka to fine leg to seal Australia\u2019s sixth win on the hop at this tournament. They are undefeated and they are the undisputed favourites.     4.27am    45th over: Australia 271-5 (Meg Lanning 135, Annabel Sutherland 21) They are more than halfway there already thanks to Sutherland, who puts away a pile-driver for six of Sune Luus. She leant forward and hit that so cleanly. Scores are level now. One run will do the trick.  Updated at 4.28am GMT    4.24am    44th over: Australia 261-5 (Meg Lanning 133, Annabel Sutherland 13) Right on cue, here is South Africa\u2019s seventh drop of the innings. Khaka to Lanning, delivery is full, not crazy quick, but Lanning smacks it back to Khaka\u2019s right-hand side. She takes a dive but her hands don\u2019t do their job. Australia need 11 runs.     4.22am    43rd over: Australia 258-5 (Meg Lanning 132, Annabel Sutherland 11) Sune Luus takes her turn to draw a four from Sutherland. South Africa\u2019s fielding has slipped considerably over the past few overs. That may be a mental thing as Australia take the ascendancy, but it is loose and it makes a difference.      4.19am    42nd over: Australia 252-5 (Meg Lanning 131, Annabel Sutherland 6) Only a matter of time now. Khaka has a crack at Sutherland. Successfully at first, but then she gifts her a nice and full one and watches as the ball barrels past mid-off for a boundary.     4.17am    41st over: Australia 246-5 (Meg Lanning 130, Annabel Sutherland 1) Lanning is still plugging away out there. Her timing is out as she hits Sune Luus on the full but still takes two for her troubles, before wrapping up with a single. Australia need 26 runs.     4.14am   Wicket! Gardner 22 Gardner c Sekhukhune b Tryon,  40th over: Australia 243-5 (Meg Lanning 127, Annabel Sutherland 1) Tryon is back in the attack and she has Gardner leaning backwards for a shot that she doesn\u2019t hit cleanly and delivers on a platter to Sekhukhune over mid-off. Annabel Sutherland walks out to the crease and opens her innings with a single to deep square.     4.09am    39th over: Australia 241-4 (Meg Lanning 126, Ashleigh Gardner 22) No risks taken and seven runs to show for it. Gardner opens with a drive over cover to the boundary and Lanning closes with a drive for a comfortable two runs.     4.06am    38th over: Australia 234-4 (Meg Lanning 124, Ashleigh Gardner 17) Kapp limits the partnership to two singles to continue her miserly shift. Just quietly, it is Meg Lanning\u2019s 30th birthday in three days. Australia will be playing Bangladesh in Wellingon. She has a successful tournament to celebrate thus far.     4.03am    37th over: Australia 232-4 (Meg Lanning 123, Ashleigh Gardner 16) Lanning takes three runs off Sekhukhune. Gardner utilises some width for a four and then adds a single and Lanning finishes with a single to sweeper cover. Australia need 40 runs from 78 balls.     4.00am    36th over: Australia 223-4 (Meg Lanning 119, Ashleigh Gardner 11) Kapp is en route to a maiden but her party is crashed by a Gardner drives which elicits a quick couple.     3.59am    35th over: Australia 221-4 (Meg Lanning 119, Ashleigh Gardner 9) Can\u2019t stop thinking about how Lee must be feeling. She was given immediate reassurance from teammates but it\u2019s still rough. Well the attention is briefly away from her at least because there is another drop and it ain\u2019t Lee. A full Sekhukhune delivery heads to Lanning\u2019s pads and she pumps it straight to mid-wicket, where Goodall reaches above her head. The ball slips straight through the hands of the fielder, whose head goes straight down as she bends over with hands on knees as the ball rolls over the boundary for four. We all know what she is thinking. The sun might not have helped her there, but that is the third drop in the last five overs.     3.51am    34th over: Australia 209-4 (Meg Lanning 108, Ashleigh Gardner 8) These missed chances are hurting the Proteas. Take them and this is a game played against the middle-to-lower order (though that does not always mean much when talking about Australia\u2019s batting line-up). South Africa submit a review for a strangle. Turns out Khaka bowled a wide to Lanning. Not out. Two balls later she bowls wide again but the rest of the over is dot balls bar an early Lanning single.  Updated at 3.56am GMT    3.47am   Wicket! McGrath 32 c Kapp b Ismail, Australia 206-4  33rd over: Australia 206-4 (Meg Lanning 107, Ashleigh Gardner 8) Is there a wicket coming soon? A couple of chances have gone begging but there have been chances for South Africa. Ismail has helped her country\u2019s cause and she\u2019s back here now. Oh and McGrath is caught! I swear I didn\u2019t already know before writing this, I\u2019ll claim the superb timing though. A short ball into McGrath\u2019s body offers no room to move and she mishits to Kapp at midwicket. Ash Gardner is in now and on her VERY FIRST BALL she is DROPPED! Poor Lee is the culprit again and it saves Gardner\u2019s blushes and gives her a boundary. Gardner takes another boundary to finish an eventful over.  Updated at 3.56am GMT    3.40am    32nd over: Australia 197-3 (Meg Lanning 106, Tahlia McGrath 32) Is this a six from McGrath? She has enthusiastically pumped a too-full effort from Khaka back in her direction and beyond. It lands in that snug cranny between the boundary and the ground and the question is which it made contact with first. Doesn\u2019t help that that section of the field is in the shade. After some contemplation the umpire gives it.     3.37am    31st over: Australia 189-3 (Meg Lanning 105, Tahlia McGrath 25) Bouncer here we come. It\u2019s from Ismail and this is the first real moment of indecision from Lanning as she swipes at the ball but clean misses it. She gets lucky when it lobs safely over the keeper. It\u2019s leg byes though as the ball makes what appears to be heavy contact with Lanning\u2019s head. She appears to be fine and is smiling as she redoes her hair but umpires call drinks anyway while she is checked out. A couple of minutes later the skipper is back out there with McGrath and swings but misses another delivery. McGrath is on strike now and she is dropped! She cuts it \u2013 more like slashes it \u2013 straight to the fielder backward point and is so lucky Lee can\u2019t take it above her head.     3.29am    30th over: Australia 183-3 (Meg Lanning 104, Tahlia McGrath 24) Based on this current score Australia can make 366, according to the statisticians, which is just wild. Right now they need only 89 runs from 120 balls. This game!     3.27am   Lanning scores a century!  She does it. Last match she was disappointed to come so, so close. This time there is no question. She pulls a full delivery deep to mid-wicket for four. This is her 10th ODI ton while chasing. Lanning\u2019s highest score, by the way, is 152 against Sri Lanka in the 2017 World Cup. In a run chase, no doubt. Not out of the question at this rate.     3.24am    29th over: Australia 176-3 (Meg Lanning 99, Tahlia McGrath 22) Lanning moves onto 99. Surely she\u2019ll get to raise her bat now. Not before McGrath unleashes a glorious cover drive to the boundary, though. What a shot. The Australian goes again but this time Sekhukhune outfoxes her with a bit of movement and the the ball is well-taken behind the stumps by Chetty. Lanning will now face Khaka, with her ton tantalisingly close.     3.21am    28th over: Australia 169-3 (Meg Lanning 96, Tahlia McGrath 18) Lanning cracks Kapp\u2019s first ball of this over through point for a single before McGrath follows with a late cut for another single. A punch to the mid-on boundary (Lanning), another cut (McGrath) and a very late cut to third man (Lanning) completes an over of five singles.     3.17am    27th over: Australia 164-3 (Meg Lanning 93, Tahlia McGrath 16) Sekhukhune is back in too for another spell and she bowls full to Lanning\u2019s stumps and cedes a single before angling one into McGrath for another. The batters are putting them everywhere. Cover. Square leg. Third man. Backward point. There is not one unfruitful ball in this over and Sekhukhune bowls a wide between it all.     3.14am    26th over: Australia 156-3 (Meg Lanning 90, Tahlia McGrath 12) Kapp steps back into the attack. Can she shake things up a bit? She bowls short and into Lanning\u2019s body, which the batter sends to fine leg for a single. A down-leg delivery to McGrath yields another single. And then another Lanning four! This is a bread-and-butter pull to her leg side. Makes it look so bloody easy. Kapp changes it up with a slower ball, then tries it again and bowls wide.     3.10am    25th over: Australia 146-3 (Meg Lanning 84, Tahlia McGrath 10) I know there is still a lot play out in this innings but if we are going on gut feelings (which I am) Australia might have this in hand. South Africa\u2019s bowlers, as formidable as they can be, do not seem to be troubling their opponents. Unless a couple of wickets drop soonish I can\u2019t see it changing. We are halfway through the innings with 126 needed for tournament favourites Australia to stay top of the table and undefeated.     3.06am    24th over: Australia 140-3 (Meg Lanning 81, Tahlia McGrath 7) Lanning is managing this run chase so smartly. She is going for those peaches when they present themselves but is staying tight when needed. Here she does the former with yet another two fours before stealing a single. McGrath taps her own single through midwicket.     3.04am    23rd over: Australia 130-3 (Meg Lanning 72, Tahlia McGrath 6) Dropped! Sune Luus bowls full to McGrath, who punches it back in her direction. But it\u2019s high and a little to her right. She leaps and has hands on it before letting it through her fingers, then knocks over Lanning in the process.     3.00am    22nd over: Australia 127-3 (Meg Lanning 69, Tahlia McGrath 6) Lanning and McGrath seem to embarked on something of a war of attrition. They are accruing runs in sets of one and two and do so again this over off some full, easily managed deliveries from Tryon. The run rate is under control now and Australia have settled in for the long haul.  Updated at 3.01am GMT    2.57am    21st over: Australia 121-3 (Meg Lanning 64, Tahlia McGrath 5) Sune Luus enters the fray, and she\u2019s sending up full tosses that invite some big runs. They are lucky it does not happen. But they still trade singles and doubles. So where are we now? Australia need 151 to win.  Updated at 3.00am GMT    2.55am   Wicket! Mooney 20 run out (Sekhukhune), Australia 114-3  20th over: Australia 114-3 (Meg Lanning 61, Tahlia McGrath 1) Mooney is out! And it\u2019s Sekhukhune, who has atoned for that troublesome over with a direct hit. Mooney had swept the ball to square leg off Tryon and goes for a single but is sent back. She\u2019s sprinting and stretching but Sekhukhune has her eye in. Tahlia McGrath and gets off the mark on the first ball she faces. But she is overshadowed by Lanning, who finishes the over with two fours! She now has nine (9).     2.50am    19th over: Australia 104-2 (Meg Lanning 52, Beth Mooney 21) Sekhukhune overcooks a delivery to Mooney, who sends the ball back the bowler\u2019s way and then straight past her for a four. Sekhukhune bowls a wide down the leg side, then makes it three. On the very next ball she does another. Something is awry for the diminutive seamer. She makes the next one, which Mooney cuts to third man for a single. Lanning capitalises another straightforward full delivery for four and her fifty! A lot of runs there by South Africa.     2.44am    18th over: Australia 88-2 (Meg Lanning 47, Beth Mooney 14) Lanning is crowded by a Tryon delivery that forces her to block. She tries to cut the next but doesn\u2019t get away with it. That is usually Lanning\u2019s happy place. She doesn\u2019t connect with the next and the half-century evades her ... for now.     2.41am    17th over: Australia 87-2 (Meg Lanning 47, Beth Mooney 13) A little bit of news concerning Ellyse Perry, who has a sore back. Cricket Australia says she is fit to bat but will not be able to come in any higher than seven due to the amount of time she spent off the field. On the field, Tumi Sekhukhune is in the attack and cops two boundaries, one apiece for the batters. Lanning pulls the first to square leg before Mooney expertly pounces on a loose delivery and flicks her own away, much to the chagrin of the fielder who tries in vain to stop it.     2.37am    16th over: Australia 77-2 (Meg Lanning 42, Beth Mooney 9) This match is such a test for both sides. Two teams unbeaten this tournament and at the top of the standings. South Africa\u2019s innings of 271 was superb. They squeezed out every run possible to make life difficult for Australia. But the latter are edging a wee bit ahead here. This chase is not impossible for this batting line-up. Drinks break!     2.33am    15th over: Australia 72-2 (Meg Lanning 41, Beth Mooney 5) South Africa\u2019s bowling is a bit off-colour by their standards. A few wides. Tryon delivers on now. She bowls short and Lanning cuts away her fifth four. Meanwhile, Nina emails in and is convinced I have underplayed that du Preez catch. \u201cIt was two handed but she was also flying through the air with both her feet off the ground \u2013 one to rival Gardner\u2019s from the first innings,\u201d she writes. :More than that, could be an absolutely vital bonus wicket considering that it wasn\u2019t the best ball and SA have had only 1 other wicket fall to spin the whole tournament!\u201d Nina, you are right. It was a worldie. Here is said catch:      2.28am    14th over: Australia 65-2 (Meg Lanning 36, Beth Mooney 4) Lanning goes the distance to finish the over with a six. It\u2019s ambitious, but then she is ambitious. She gets right under Khaka\u2019s delivery and sends it into the air and all the way.     2.24am    13th over: Australia 56-2 (Meg Lanning 29, Beth Mooney 3) ALMOST a four as Lanning faces Tryon and one-ups her with an outside edge the keeper can\u2019t get too. Unlucky for Australia, third man does. She\u2019s wrong-footed a little but stops the ball in its tracks in the nick of time.     2.22am    12th over: Australia 51-2 (Meg Lanning 25, Beth Mooney 2) Khaka bowls a wide to Lanning. Australia\u2019s captain then smacks two runs through point and manages another single. But South Africa are probably in the better position right now. Australia need 216 to win and they will have to get a wriggle on to make that happen.     2.18am   Wicket! Rachael Haynes 17 c du Preez b Tryon, Australia 47-2  10th over: Australia 47-2 (Meg Lanning 22, Beth Mooney 2) Haynes is gone! Chloe Tryon has just entered the attack but this short, flat delivery isn\u2019t exactly testing. Haynes pulls with ease and the ball sails up, up and over to ... du Preez. She\u2019s at deep mid-wicket, she\u2019s skipping forward and then dives and emerges with the goods in hand. That\u2019s a shame for Haynes. She had been good. Welcome, Beth Mooney.     2.13am    10th over: Australia 44-1 (Meg Lanning 21, Rachael Haynes 17) We have a new bowler now in Ayabonga Khaka, whose statistics suggest she could yet have a field day out here. A right-armer who likes to take wickets. If anything, her strong economy might slow this partnership down a little. So far, so good on that front. She pitches with a good line and length and Haynes manages only two this over.     2.09am    Ninth over: Australia 42-1 (Meg Lanning 21, Rachael Haynes 15) Just as I\u2019ve written that Haynes puts away a four. Ismail, who had just made the batter duck another bouncer, sends this one down too wide and Haynes slices it deftly. This surface is pristine. Little room for error. Lanning chips over mid-on with ease for another four. And why wouldn\u2019t she?     2.05am    Eighth over: Australia 33-1 (Meg Lanning 17, Rachael Haynes 10) Haynes is still getting going. She faces an inswinger and manages to squeeze out a single to mid-off. Lanning, meanwhile, is getting into a groove. She drills through the offside and then covers for four. Kapp invited that with two much length and Lanning takes advantage.     2.01am    Seventh over: Australia 27-1 (Meg Lanning 12, Rachael Haynes 9) A jaffa from Ismail to Lanning catches the edge of all edges. And yet it sails untouched, almost inexplicably so, through the gap between keeper and slip. It was Chetty\u2019s to take but she had been heading the other and got her feet tangled up. A small appeal against Haynes is then quickly overlooked and moved on.     1.56am    Sixth over: Australia 22-1 (Meg Lanning 7, Rachael Haynes 9) Meg Lanning has other ideas against Kapp though, threading a cut past a diving fielder at backward point and to the ropes for four. The captain took advantage there off a delivery with a bit of width. It came one ball after Kapp had sent down an absolute humdinger too.     1.54am    Fifth over: Australia 17-1 (Meg Lanning 2, Rachael Haynes 9) I\u2019m blaming it on the dog, who may or may not have had some fun with some wiring. Also, hello. Thank you Mike. And I\u2019m back just in time to see Ismail bowl a maiden to Haynes. She starts with a yorker and follows it with a bouncer that forces the batter to duck, before defending her way through the rest of the over. Ismail is killing it.     1.50am    Fourth over: Australia 17-1 (Meg Lanning 2, Rachael Haynes 9) Just two off this next over from Kapp, a single each for Lanning and Haynes. And here\u2019s Emma, fresh from the off-and-on trick with her modem, to take you through the rest of this match.      1.45am    Third over: Australia 15-1 (Meg Lanning 1, Rachael Haynes 8) After Healy goes first ball of Ismail\u2019s over, caught by her counterpart behind the stumps, captain Lanning arrives at the crease. Ismail continues her good work with another four dots before Lanning edges low through the slips and via a ricochet gets off the mark - and spoils what would have been a wicket maiden for Ismail.   Updated at 1.45am GMT    1.42am   WICKET! Healy c Chetty b Ismail 5 (Australia 14-1)  Ismail throws down a peach of a delivery that moves away and Healy nicks off and is caught behind! South Africa have an early breakthrough and the dangerwoman.      1.40am    Second over: Australia 14-0 (Alyssa Healy 5, Rachael Haynes 8) Marizanne Kapp opens for South Africa from the other end with a wide - you could claim that\u2019s a loosener - before Haynes nudges a single through the leg side. Healy then finds the boundary again for Australia, this time with a flick off her legs that races down to the ropes down at fine leg. An inside edge has Australian hearts in mouths, briefly, but Healy survives and it\u2019s another fruitful over for the batting side.      1.36am    First over: Australia 7-0 (Alyssa Healy 0, Rachael Haynes 7) This will be the second highest run chase in the World Cup if the world No 1 side can pull it off. Australia start very brightly as opener Healy gets off the mark without any ado at all with a punched cover drive off Shabnim Ismail\u2019s first delivery for two. She follows that with the first boundary of the day, through point, as a full toss is fully punished. Seven off the opener, and that will do Australia for now.     1.29am    We\u2019re just waiting for Emma to fix some technical issues at her end, but she\u2019ll be here shortly. The umpires are on their way out again and we should be good to go shortly. Meanwhile, in case you hadn\u2019t realised, Laura Wolvaardt is on fire:   Updated at 1.46am GMT    1.09am   South Africa 271-5  Well that was a sensational finish that was driven by Marizanne Kapp and ably assisted by Chloe Tryon. Some really impressive running got every little run possible out of the pitch and put themselves in the best possible position to defend this total. Australia are excellent in the chase however and they were able to chase down a bigger score against India on the weekend. What does work in SA\u2019s favour is their bowling attack - statistically the best in the tournament. While Australia do have statistically the best batting, SA will take a lot of confidence from the way India were able to recover late and take Australia into the final over. If they can do that, their strong death bowlers will have a good shot at restricting the Australians. On Australia\u2019s side is the depth of their batting line up. By adding Sutherland in place of Brown they\u2019ve given themselves even more depth than they had against India. You have to get down to Schutt at 11 before you find a genuine non-batter in this line up. Any kind of partnership early and the Australians put themselves in a strong position to take the win. It\u2019s sure to be an enthralling second innings, so take a quick break and refuel before we see what Haynes and Healy can offer up at the start of this chase. I\u2019m going to leave you in the very capable hands of Emma Kemp to take you to the end of this match. Thanks for joining me, I\u2019ll be glued to the coverage for the upcoming innings!     1.02am    50th over: South Africa 271-5 (Marizanne Kapp 30, Chloe Tryon 17) Here we are into the final over for SA and Kapp starts it well with a sweep around the corner past deep fine leg for four. Jonassen pulls back next ball and doesn\u2019t give away a run. She then offers up a full toss and Kapp pulls it to deep midwicket and pushes hard for two runs. It\u2019s really excellent running from these two - the best running we\u2019ve seen from SA all match. She then scoops one past fine leg for another four. Tryon gets to face the final ball of the over and she gives it everything she\u2019s got with a slog sweep to deep midwicket and again they push themselves hard and get two runs to finish off their innings.      12.57am    49th over: South Africa 258-5 (Marizanne Kapp 19, Chloe Tryon 15) Schutt returns for the penultimate over - her 10th over of the match. Kapp plays a good pull shot and she pushes Tryon for two. Kapp will eke out every run available from this pitch, she has a great sense of urgency about her. Tryon slog sweeps beautifully for six over deep midwicket - it\u2019s an unusually expensive over from Schutt.     12.54am    48th over: South Africa 246-5 (Marizanne Kapp 16, Chloe Tryon 6) Jonassen takes another, hoping for as good an over as her last one. She starts it very well with two dots, but Kapp isn\u2019t intimidated and she slog sweeps the next one past deep midwicket for four. She then drives on for two, misses her timing next ball and finishes by cutting one right through the gap for another four.     12.51am    47th over: South Africa 236-5 (Marizanne Kapp 6, Chloe Tryon 6) Schutt is back for her ninth over and it\u2019s another couple of quick singles to start her over, but the South Africans will need more than singles to give their bowlers a good score to defend. A wayward throw at the stumps and some good running gives them a chance at two and then Kapp pushes for two again the next ball. They\u2019ve pushed the run rate up above five an over now.     12.48am    46th over: South Africa 228-5 (Marizanne Kapp 4, Chloe Tryon 0) Into the final five overs of the game now and we\u2019ve got Jonassen to bowl it. There\u2019s been a lot of chopping and changing by Lanning with the bowlers so far. Only Gardner has bowled out her overs so far. A strong pull shot from du Preez can only pick up a single and Kapp looks keen to keep the runs coming against the very economical death bowling of Jonassen, but du Preez can\u2019t get a big shot past Gardner and now it\u2019s Tryon to partner with Kapp to try to boost the scoring.     12.47am   WICKET! Mignon du Preez 14 c Gardner b Jonassen, South Africa 228-5  That ball was pulled hard by du Preez and looked like it would get past Gardner, but she snaffles it out of the air one-handed like a magician and du Preez has to go. A sensational catch from Gardner.     12.43am    45th over: South Africa 226-4 (Marizanne Kapp 3, Mignon du Preez 13) A big ask for Kapp and du Preez now, as SA lose their two set batters in quick succession. But if anyone can put on a good late score, it will be these two. They deal in singles to start with against Gardner, content with rotating the strike. du Preez goes for a big reverse sweep in the middle of the over, but it slides under her bat. So next ball she tries a regular sweep and it\u2019s in the air, but it falls out of Carey\u2019s grasp and bounces over the boundary.     12.41am    44th over: South Africa 218-4 (Marizanne Kapp 1, Mignon du Preez 7) Let\u2019s see what du Preez can do in these final overs. We\u2019ve seen plenty of her in the WBBL and know how dangerous she can be, so the Australians will be desperate to contain her. They send Schutt straight in to do the job, but du Preez sweeps one very fine and evades Sutherland on the boundary to pick up four. She\u2019s showing plenty of intent early. She sweeps another, but this one is just a single and Sutherland collects it easily. Luus goes for a big pull shot and mistimes it, giving McGrath a nice catch and bringing Kapp to the crease.     12.39am   WICKET! Sune Luus 52 c McGrath b Schutt, South Africa 216-4  A big loss for SA there, Luus has been so good on the pull shot, but doesn\u2019t get control of that one and it falls into the safe hands of McGrath.     12.35am    43rd over: South Africa 211-3 (Sune Luus 52, Mignon du Preez 1) Gardner replaces Schutt and Luus pulls the first ball away - it really should be two, but they don\u2019t turn quick enough and it\u2019s only one. They learn their lesson though and next ball, they go hard and pick up two. Wolvaardt mistimes her drive and is caught by McGrath, bringing Mignon du Preez to the crease.     12.34am   WICKET! Laura Wolvaardt 90 c McGrath b Gardner, South Africa 209-3  Wolvaardt knows she has to pick up the pace and she slightly mistimes her drive, which is all McGrath needs to swoop in and take a nice catch at long off.     12.31am    42nd over: South Africa 206-2 (Sune Luus 50, Laura Wolvaardt 88) Jonassen returns now, coming over the wicket to Luus, who sweeps her away to bring up the 200 for SA. Wolvaardt gets a leading edge next ball that pops up in the air, but again there\u2019s no fielder underneath it and she\u2019s safe. Then Luus pulls one beautifully that travels so quickly that the Australians have no chance of using their strong boundary fielding to cut it off and it\u2019s four. But Jonassen tightens up and fights back with a couple of dots. Luus picks up a single off the last to bring up her 50 off just 48 balls.  Updated at 12.35am GMT    12.27am    41st over: South Africa 199-2 (Sune Luus 44, Laura Wolvaardt 87) We\u2019re into the last 10 overs now and there\u2019s a bit of urgency creeping into the game. Luus gets a top edge that offers a chance, but there are no fielders underneath it and she manages to pick up two. They\u2019ll find it hard to score big off Schutt\u2019s bowling, but they need to keep pushing up the run rate at this time of the match. It\u2019s another six from the over, keeping things moving fairly well for now.     12.24am    40th over: South Africa 193-2 (Sune Luus 40, Laura Wolvaardt 85) Another over for McGrath, which she will hope is better than her last. Her line is better to start and the batters are still just working in singles. Luus finds the line she\u2019s looking for on the last and sweeps it past fine leg for four.     12.21am    39th over: South Africa 186-2 (Sune Luus 35, Laura Wolvaardt 83) Schutt returns to the attack to try to break this partnership - either with a wicket herself or by creating the pressure for the bowler at the other end to capitalise on. She is so economical that she often frustrates the batters into making mistakes in the next over. The batters don\u2019t allow the pressure to build early, with some quick singles to rotate the strike. Schutt then aborts her run up after seeming to forget to let go of the ball and Luus pulls one away for another single, before Wolvaardt goes to the other side of the field looking for her single. They can\u2019t get Schutt away here, but they\u2019ve done an excellent job to pick up a single from every ball and keep the run rate in check.     12.17am    38th over: South Africa 180-2 (Sune Luus 32, Laura Wolvaardt 80) McGrath returns for just her third over today and Luus finds a gap with her cut shot immediately and sends it to the boundary for four. She looks for the same shot next ball, but this one is a little mistimed and Haynes is there to field it. She then looks to the other side of the wicket, but can\u2019t quite get under that one either. McGrath then gives away a wide that gets away from Healy and heads down to the boundary. Lanning comes back for another of her long chats with the bowler and McGrath tightens up her line next ball. Luus comes up with a beautiful straight drive that evades McGrath and Carey, but is cut off before the reaches the boundary.     12.12am    37th over: South Africa 168-2 (Sune Luus 25, Laura Wolvaardt 80) Gardner continues and SA get back into the swing of things after the drinks break with a couple of quick singles. Wolvaardt sweeps one away to get to 80 - her highest score of the tournament so far. They bring up the 50 partnership from the next ball.     12.07am    36th over: South Africa 164-2 (Sune Luus 23, Laura Wolvaardt 78) Luus slog sweeps early against King for four and she looks to be putting her foot on the accelerator now. Wolvaardt cuts one through a nice gap in the field, but McGrath is at deep cover to cut it off. It\u2019s a good over for SA, nine from it, scoring from every ball. Drinks are on the field now.      12.04am    35th over: South Africa 155-2 (Sune Luus 17, Laura Wolvaardt 75) Gardner comes back into the attack, so more spin, but a different kind of spin that she offers up. The South Africans are still taking things fairly easy, but when they see their opportunities, they take them. Luus does just that with a beautiful sweep past deep square leg for four.     12.01am    34th over: South Africa 148-2 (Sune Luus 12, Laura Wolvaardt 73) King bowls her sixth over of the day and this spin from both ends is putting a bit of hurry up in this game. Luus sweeps one around the corner to deep fine leg and another bit of excellent fielding from Schutt on the boundary cuts it off. Carey is still on the field for Perry, which is a little bit concerning for Australia, but hopefully it\u2019s just a precaution going into their batting innings.     11.57pm    33rd over: South Africa 143-2 (Sune Luus 9, Laura Wolvaardt 71) Another over for Jonassen and Wolvaardt gets her captain on strike straight away. Luus plays out a couple of dots and then goes for an aggressive drive straight down the ground for four. She tries a pull shot to follow, but doesn\u2019t get her feet all the way to it and can\u2019t get it past the field.     11.55pm    32nd over: South Africa 138-2 (Sune Luus 5, Laura Wolvaardt 70) King returns to the attack, looking for her second wicket. Luus drives one hard first up, but can\u2019t get it past the field and settles for a single. Wolvaardt plays a risky drive up in the air, but it sails over the fielders and over the boundary for four. She takes two from the next ball and looks to be trying to increase the run rate. King has had a good impact on this match so far and is challenging the batters with every ball.      11.52pm    31st over: South Africa 130-2 (Sune Luus 4, Laura Wolvaardt 63) An important time for SA now, Australia have been really successful in drying up their runs in the last few overs, but we\u2019ve reached the time now where we expect to see teams accelerating. They\u2019ve got a great platform in place, but they will need to put a good score on the board to give their bowlers something strong to defend.      11.49pm    30th over: South Africa 126-2 (Sune Luus 2, Laura Wolvaardt 61) Sutherland continues and bowls a good length to Wolvaardt, creating some pressure on the set batter. Eventually Wolvaardt is able to throw her hands at the ball and cuts it away to deep point for a single. It\u2019s a very good over from Sutherland, just one from it.     11.46pm    29th over: South Africa 125-2 (Sune Luus 2, Laura Wolvaardt 60) Jonassen continues and Wolvaardt immediately sweeps her away for a single. Luus gets her first look at Jonassen for the day and defends her first couple of balls before sweeping one very fine to get herself off strike. Wolvaardt gets a little deceived by Jonassen coming over the wicket and the ball gets caught up underneath her, but then she plays a very similar shot to the one that got Goodall out, but there\u2019s no fielder under it and it falls safely.  Updated at 11.49pm GMT    11.43pm    28th over: South Africa 122-1 (Sune Luus 1, Laura Wolvaardt 60) Sutherland starts her next over with a wide, but fights back next ball with the wicket of Goodall. Luus comes to the crease and gets off the mark immediately with a single, getting her in form batter back on strike. Wolvaardt plays a very nice cut shot, but McGrath cuts it off before it gets too close to the boundary rope. She then finds a bit of space down near third for a single and Luus defends one back to give the strike back to Wolvaardt for the next over.  Updated at 11.49pm GMT    11.40pm   WICKET! Lara Goodall 15 c King b Sutherland, South Africa 118-2  Just as Goodall was finding her rhythm, she has to go. Sutherland puts in a good length cutter and Goodall can\u2019t quite get underneath it and sends an easy catch down to King.     11.38pm    27th over: South Africa 117-1 (Lara Goodall 15, Laura Wolvaardt 59) Jonassen comes back for her third over after her short spell during the power play. Goodall takes a couple of balls to adjust to the different style of Jonassen and then drives one back at her, but it\u2019s just a bit too wide of her for her to take another one of her amazing reaction catches off her own bowling. Goodall goes for her paddle again, doesn\u2019t quite make contact with the ball and then takes a less risky drive to get herself a single from the over.     11.35pm    26th over: South Africa 116-1 (Lara Goodall 14, Laura Wolvaardt 59) Sutherland takes her fourth over of the day, with Goodall starting on strike. A good length from Sutherland to start and the change against Goodall looks to be a smart one. The next ball she can only defend the ball back to Sutherland, but then she finds some very good space down to the pocket through midwicket and picks up two, then reacts to a shorter ball from Sutherland to pull it away for a single. Sutherland finishes with a bouncer to Wolvaardt that comes off her helmet and pops up in the air and over the boundary for four. Wolvaardt is now undertaking the concussion protocols, but she looks to be OK.     11.31pm    25th over: South Africa 109-1 (Lara Goodall 11, Laura Wolvaardt 55) Wolvaardt starts the over by driving one past long off for four - it\u2019s a very assured shot. Nicola Carey is on the field for Perry at the moment, who is reportedly working through a little back niggle. Hopefully she can recover in time to bat for Australia later on. A little bit more risky running from the South Africans, but they make it back again when the direct hit attempt misses the stumps. It\u2019s a good over for SA, with nine runs from it.     11.27pm    24th over: South Africa 100-1 (Lara Goodall 9, Laura Wolvaardt 50) Goodall isn\u2019t going to let King take another maiden on her and immediately gets off strike with a quick single to give Wolvaardt a shot at bringing up her 50. King makes her wait, with some good length balls that Wolvaardt can\u2019t get away, she gets cramped up and doesn\u2019t have the space to get them out. Eventually she does find what she\u2019s looking for and brings up her 50 with a cover drive (what else?) before Goodall finds her first boundary to finish the over.     11.24pm    23rd over: South Africa 94-1 (Lara Goodall 4, Laura Wolvaardt 49) Gardner continues with her fifth over today and Wolvaardt picks up a quick single to make sure it\u2019s not another maiden and the strike keeps rotating. Goodall still doesn\u2019t look quite settled - she eventually finds space for her paddle, which goes straight up in the air, but she knows there\u2019s no fielder there and picks up two runs from it. Gardner finishes the over with some excellent fielding from her own bowling.     11.21pm    22nd over: South Africa 90-1 (Lara Goodall 1, Laura Wolvaardt 48) Another over for King, so we have spin from both ends now. Goodall can\u2019t get her away early - she looks for a sweep, but despite her being an unknown factor, she\u2019s clearly not unknown to Australia\u2019s performance analysts, as they have a fielder in place to cut that off. Again Lanning comes in for a long chat before the final ball of the over - it might be a tactic to slow down the game and unsettle the batters? It\u2019s a maiden for King.      11.18pm    21st over: South Africa 90-1 (Lara Goodall 1, Laura Wolvaardt 48) Gardner comes back into the attack and starts with three dot balls before Wolvaardt takes a very quick single and tests Goodall\u2019s running and reactions very early. Goodall is a bit of an unknown factor for Australia, having not played in the WBBL and coming into the team for Tamzin Britts this game. She gets off the mark with a single on the last - she\u2019s looking for two, but decides not to risk it.     11.15pm    20th over: South Africa 88-1 (Lara Goodall 0, Laura Wolvaardt 47) A big pull shot from Lee from the first ball of King\u2019s over and it hits Gardner on the foot and spins away from her. King tightens up with a couple of dot balls and then she gets Lee with a plumb LBW, bringing Goodall to the crease.  Updated at 11.19pm GMT    11.14pm   WICKET! Lizelle Lee 36 lbw King, South Africa 88-1  Finally Australia break this partnership and it\u2019s King who manages it, with a ball that evades Lee and strikes her on the knee roll. She decides not to review and heads back to the sheds.     11.11pm    19th over: South Africa 84-0 (Lizelle Lee 32, Laura Wolvaardt 47) McGrath takes her second over and Australia have now used all seven of their bowlers in the first 18 overs of the match to try to take a wicket, but they haven\u2019t found that breakthrough just yet. It won\u2019t be worrying them too much just yet, as SA haven\u2019t been incredibly dominant with the bat, but it is putting a very good platform in place for them to launch from if they can both stay in.      11.07pm    18th over: South Africa 79-0 (Lizelle Lee 28, Laura Wolvaardt 46) Alana King gets her first opportunity of the day and Lee rotates the strike immediately and then King nearly gets the much needed breakthrough. A little edge from Wolvaardt goes so close to hitting the stumps, but it races away towards third instead. It\u2019s a very good over from King.     11.02pm    17th over: South Africa 76-0 (Lizelle Lee 27, Laura Wolvaardt 44) We get to see some Tahlia McGrath for the first time today and Healy is keeping up to the stumps to the medium pacer to try to cramp Lee up. But Lee isn\u2019t bothered and brings out her sweep shot past deep backward square and over the boundary for four. Wolvaardt looks a little more unsettled by McGrath when she gets on strike, reaching for a couple of wider balls outside off stump, which could prove dangerous for her. Drinks are on the field now.     10.58pm    16th over: South Africa 71-0 (Lizelle Lee 22, Laura Wolvaardt 44) Lee plays one defensively straight back to Sutherland, but next ball she finds some space in the air and gets it up and over the infield and past long off for four. She gets herself off strike and Wolvaardt plays a truly beautiful looking cut shot, which is unfortunately only a single. You could hang pretty much all of Wolvaardt\u2019s shots in the Louvre, they\u2019re so delightful to watch.     10.56pm    15th over: South Africa 64-0 (Lizelle Lee 16, Laura Wolvaardt 43) Some 00s nostalgia from the music operators at the ground, as they serve up Crazy Town\u2019s Butterly over the loud speakers - that\u2019ll bring the crowds in for sure. Gardner continues and the batters pick up a single each, before Gardner changes it up and comes around the wicket, which results in two dot balls, before Wolvaardt drives one down the ground for a single. There\u2019s an appeal on the last ball of the over, but no interest from the umpire. The ball races away and King finds herself with a lot of work to do on the boundary. She gets there in good time, gets tangled up and nearly smashes the ball into the rope, but somehow manages to get it away.      10.52pm    14th over: South Africa 58-0 (Lizelle Lee 12, Laura Wolvaardt 41) Another over for Sutherland and Wolvaardt rotates the strike immediately and then Lee also takes a single. The batters are looking a little more comfortable against her now and Wolvaardt plays a beautiful little flick off the front foot that nearly makes it to the boundary, but Schutt cuts it off. The Australians have fielded excellently on the boundary today.      10.48pm    13th over: South Africa 53-0 (Lizelle Lee 11, Laura Wolvaardt 37) Lee finally gets some strike, she hasn\u2019t seen much of it so far. Gardner continues with her spell and Lee looks for a big sweep early, but she misjudges the ball and starts to look frustrated at her lack of scoring opportunities. It\u2019s a maiden from Gardner, the first of the match.  Updated at 10.48pm GMT    10.47pm    12th over: South Africa 53-0 (Lizelle Lee 11, Laura Wolvaardt 37) It\u2019s just a short stint for Jonassen as now we have Sutherland taking over from the scoreboard end. Her first ball is excellent, a very good length and sitting just outside off stump. The SA batters were looking quite comfortable against spin, so this looks like a good change up to try to take a wicket and break this partnership before they get too settled and start scoring with more ease. Sutherland gives away a wide and then Wolvaardt plays a beautiful straight drive down the ground for four to bring up the 50 for SA - the first 50 run opening partnership against Australia so far this tournament. Wolvaardt teases one up in the air, but it falls short of Perry and she plays the last ball of the over safely, defending it back to Sutherland.     10.42pm    11th over: South Africa 48-0 (Lizelle Lee 11, Laura Wolvaardt 33) Schutt takes a break and we have Gardner taking over from her end. SA seem happy to continue dealing in singles early and wait for their opportunities. Wolvaardt eventually finds one that\u2019s a bit too short and she pulls it past deep backward square leg for four.     10.38pm    10th over: South Africa 41-0 (Lizelle Lee 10, Laura Wolvaardt 27) Another over for Jonassen to finish the power play. She starts well, but then bowls one a little too short and Wolvaardt is able to pull it away, but she doesn\u2019t quite time it perfectly and it\u2019s just a single. Jonassen doesn\u2019t quite have her line and length right, but she\u2019s not being punished too much for it by the batters just yet. However they\u2019ll be pleased to not let Jonassen build the dot ball pressure on them. No wickets in the powerplay for Australia, which is quite unusual - SA will be happy with that effort.     10.35pm    9th over: South Africa 36-0 (Lizelle Lee 8, Laura Wolvaardt 24) This has been the best opening partnership for SA so far this tournament, so good signs early. They will want to consolidate this and give themselves a platform to launch from. Lee is quite keen on the sweep to fine leg, but she can\u2019t quite find the boundary down there. Wolvaardt pulls one nicely to deep midwicket and it looks like she might pick up four, but the outfield is quite slow due to some earlier rain and Gardner is able to cut it off before it hits the rope.      10.32pm    8th over: South Africa 32-0 (Lizelle Lee 7, Laura Wolvaardt 21) Lanning seems to have also noticed the ease with which Wolvaardt particularly was scoring off Perry, so she\u2019s brought Jonassen into the attack early. It works in unsettling the batters a little and Lee gives away a top edge from a sweep late in the over, but it falls safely and they only take a single from it.     10.29pm    7th over: South Africa 30-0 (Lizelle Lee 6, Laura Wolvaardt 20) Schutt is certainly the more economical of the bowlers so far, but both Lee and Wolvaardt are starting to look a bit more confident against her, getting it through the field more often and taking ones when in previous overs they were restricted to dots. They\u2019re not playing her with the same ease as they are Perry, but there\u2019s less frustration. Wolvaardt takes a risky single on the last and Lee is slow to respond, but again she makes it back.     10.26pm    6th over: South Africa 25-0 (Lizelle Lee 5, Laura Wolvaardt 16) Perry bowls her first ball of the over a bit too short and Wolvaardt has no trouble pulling it to deep midwicket for two. She likes the next one as well, which she drives to deep cover for another two. Perry misses her line again for another wide and then find a better line for her field and Wolvaardt plays it straight to Gardner at point. Wolvaardt gets one just past McGrath and take the quick single - Gardner gets a good throw in, but Lee scrambles home and is safe.      10.21pm    5th over: South Africa 19-0 (Lizelle Lee 5, Laura Wolvaardt 11) Schutt continues and Wolvaardt pops one up in the air, but there are no fielders in close to make her pay for it. She then tucks one off her hip nicely around to fine leg - it looks like it could be two runs, but they\u2019re happy to just take the single. Lee has a go at that fine leg area as well with a nice sweep and it looks like it\u2019s heading over the boundary, but some excellent fielding from Perry on the rope restricts her to two.     10.17pm    4th over: South Africa 16-0 (Lizelle Lee 3, Laura Wolvaardt 10) Perry is given another opportunity and will hope to make up for her expensive first over. She starts well, her line is looking better and Wolvaardt can only defend the first two balls straight to the field. She plays a stronger stroke on the third, but it\u2019s still not enough to penetrate the field. The fourth ball is a bit of a disaster for Perry - it slips out of her hand and it\u2019s a full toss straight at Wolvaardt\u2019s head and of course is ruled a no ball. Perry bangs one in short for the free hit and Wolvaardt can\u2019t take advantage of it and it\u2019s a dot ball. She manages to finish with a single to retain the strike.     10.13pm    3rd over: South Africa 14-0 (Lizelle Lee 3, Laura Wolvaardt 9) Schutt resumes and there\u2019s an appeal on the second ball of the over for LBW, but the umpire isn\u2019t interested and Lanning can\u2019t be talked into a review. The inswing of Schutt is looking difficult to play on this pitch, she\u2019s not giving the batters a lot of room to move and dig the ball out to get past the field. Lanning and Schutt have a long discussion before the final ball of the over and move cover out quite deep, which gives Wolvaardt an easy single.     10.09pm    2nd over: South Africa 12-0 (Lizelle Lee 2, Laura Wolvaardt 8) Ellyse Perry gets us underway from the scoreboard end - she was the one who really struggled with her line last game, so it will be interested to see how she adjusts today. The Wellington venue tends to suit her better and she\u2019s not giving away wides early, but Lee pulls one aggressively for a single first ball, then Wolvaardt plays a nice cut shot in the air that finds a gap and then the boundary for four. Midway through the over Perry falters with her line and gives away a wide and then Wolvaardt plays her trademark glorious cover drive for another four when Perry offers up a half volley. Perry tightens up for the final couple of balls of the over, but it was quite an expensive one from her.     10.04pm    1st over: South Africa 2-0 (Lizelle Lee 1, Laura Wolvaardt 0) We\u2019re off, with Megan Schutt taking the new ball, as she does most often. She gets some good swing first up - the pitch looks like quite a nice bowling pitch with a bit of green on top. Her second ball is a wide - which became quite a theme of Australia\u2019s bowling against India on Saturday, so they will hope that doesn\u2019t become a pattern again today. Lee is looking for a quick single off every ball, but it takes her a little while to find an opportunity. Wolvaardt takes her time settling in against her Adelaide Strikers teammate and blocks out the rest of the over.  Updated at 10.09pm GMT    9.47pm    A few changes for the teams today from their last games - for Australia Annabel Sutherland comes in for Darcie Brown. This seems to be about management of Brown as much as anything. She\u2019s still only 18 years old and they\u2019ll want to keep her fresh for the finals. For SA, Lara Goodall replaces Tamzin Britts and Tumi Sekhukhune comes in for Masabata Klaas.  There are plenty of these players who will be familiar to each other from the WBBL, even though this is the first time Australia have played SA in ODIs since 2017.      9.37pm   South Africa XI  Laura Wolvaardt Lizelle Lee Lara Goodall Sune Luus (c) Mignon du Preez Marizanne Kapp Chloe Tryon Trisha Chetty (wk) Shabnim Ismail Ayabonga Khaka Tumi Sekhukhune      9.36pm   Australia XI  Alyssa Healy (wk) Rachael Haynes Meg Lanning (c) Ellyse Perry Beth Mooney Tahlia McGrath Ashleigh Gardner Annabel Sutherland Jessica Jonassen Alana King Megan Schutt     9.35pm   Australia win the toss and elect to bowl  Well, Meg Lanning won the toss and unsurprisingly decided to chase! So they will want to get off to good start with the ball to make that chase pretty straightforward against the very strong SA bowling attack we spoke about earlier.   Updated at 9.41pm GMT    9.31pm   Preamble  Good morning and welcome to what we hope might be the match up of the tournament so far! Both teams sit undefeated at the top of the table and this win will provide plenty of confidence and ascendancy for whoever takes it out. While Australia have been dominant so far, South Africa have arguably the best bowling attack in world cricket and if Australia wins the toss and chooses their beloved chasing position, they will want to make sure they have restricted SA enough in their innings that the total is chaseable in the face of such formidable bowlers. The net run rates (1.424 for Australia vs 0.226 for SA) tell an interesting story as well. While Australia\u2019s wins have largely been dominant, SA have pulled off miraculous wins under extreme pressure. Fortunately for Australia they had a dose of that pressure on Saturday when India took some late wickets to take their game into the final over so they have had some experience being there if this match goes down to the wire. The two pressure specialists from the teams are of course Australia\u2019s Beth Mooney and SA\u2019s Marizanne Kapp, who have both been incredibly cool and calm in those pressure situations so far. I\u2019m looking forward to seeing a kind of \u201cice-in-their-veins off\u201d between the two experienced campaigners today. We\u2019re just about ready for the toss, so let\u2019s get ready to jump in!   "

After their 3-0 win at the City Ground, the United manager was pleased at the manner in which his team responded to Sunday\u2019s Premier League defeat at Arsenal that left them 11 points behind the Premier League leaders. But he came as close as he comes to an emotional outpouring when evaluating Rashford\u2019s remarkable progress that was confirmed by a brilliant opening goal here, when he ran half the length of the pitch and between two Forest defenders before switching the ball from right foot to left to score.  \u201cThere are more players who are playing really well but I am happy with Marcus, his performance and his development,\u201d Ten Hag said. \u201cFrom the start of the season he is growing and keeps doing that. We have to keep his process going and if he is in that mood and spirit, I think he is unstoppable. \u201cIt is up to the team to get him in the right positions. In possession we have a plan, [but it is up to some players like] like Rashy, Bruno [Fernandes] and Christian Eriksen to be creative in the final third and do something no one expects, some crazy stuff.\u201d Forest could be forgiven for focusing on their next Premier League game away to Leeds a week on Sunday and Cooper accepts the second leg at Old Trafford next Wednesday will be about more than trying to achieve a miraculous comeback. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be incredibly difficult,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was going to be that anyway but it\u2019s going to be three times that now. We\u2019ve got to set some objectives so that we come out of the next game better than we go into it.\u201d Ten Hag was also gratified to see Wout Weghorst score his first goal for United but took as a warning the counterattack that allowed Forest to believe they had equalised before Sam Surridge was adjudged offside. \u201cThere was one moment that could have changed it and we have to avoid that,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is a learning moment to develop a really good team [after] the first 20 minutes was all ours. Then we allow them to come back in the game and that can\u2019t happen, it is a learning moment. The second half was much better, much more calm.\u201d"

                    "body": "\u201cI think people don\u2019t really know me,\u201d Anthony Martial says. \u201cSometimes you see me and I\u2019m not smiling, but in life you can ask anyone: I\u2019m always smiling. I\u2019m just on the pitch, focused, trying to do my best so I\u2019m not smiling, but that doesn\u2019t reflect how I feel.\u201d And yet, he admits, by November it did \u2013 not least because he wasn\u2019t on the pitch much any more, playing only 11% of available minutes this season. The joy had gone and it was time to get out of Manchester United. Seville held the hope of happiness. Ralf Rangnick claimed that Martial had asked not to play against Aston Villa in January. The striker denied that, but admits he had told United\u2019s manager he wanted to leave almost two months earlier. He returned three days after Villa, providing an assist for Marcus Rashford\u2019s late winner against West Ham, but it would be his last game. United had resisted a sale but three days later, a six-month loan to Spain was finalised. Now, 51 days on, he returns to England to face David Moyes\u2019s side again, this time in Sevilla\u2019s colours.  Martial had long needed this. The day Rangnick was made manager at Old Trafford, his mind had already been made. \u201cWhen he arrived, my objective was to leave,\u201d he says. \u201cI told him I wanted to leave and that\u2019s it. He talked to me. He said that if you want to stay, with the way you are training if you continue to train like that, you will play. But my objective was that I wanted to leave, to have a new atmosphere, a new club.\u201d The Sevilla sporting director, Monchi, says: \u201cNegotiations were very hard. It was virtually two months of conversations, and so we were satisfied with how the market concluded.\u201d It helped that Martial was clear about his destination. \u201cI had a lot of options but I talked to the manager [Julen Lopetegui] and with Monchi and I said Sevilla was the best option to play and enjoy football again because I lost it a little bit in Manchester,\u201d Martial says. \u201cI wasn\u2019t playing and I knew that if I went to Sevilla, I would have the occasion to play and enjoy myself. I feel very good at Sevilla. The city\u2019s very good and we are a good team, so for me it\u2019s perfect. I\u2019m playing so I am happy.\u201d  \u201cThe World Cup for me is an objective. I want to be part of this group, and that\u2019s also why I am here today: because I want to play and show that I can be in the squad. I need to play, to show my quality and score goals. I knew Jules Kound\u00e9 from the national team but I didn\u2019t really know him so now I do and there are some players who speak French and English, which is better for me because my Spanish is not great. I\u2019m trying to learn but it is not easy because the time is very short.\u201d Immediately included in the starting XI, Martial provided an assist against Elche on his second appearance, although injury ruled him out of the Seville derby and the trip to Alav\u00e9s. In the Europa League he scored in his first game against Dinamo Zagreb but missed the return. As he regained fitness, he played 15 minutes against West Ham last week and 36 minutes at Rayo at the weekend. In total, he has played six times, scoring one and assisting one. \u201cIn Spain, all the teams try to play: they\u2019re very technical, they try to have the possession. In England it\u2019s a little bit different: it\u2019s faster, it\u2019s more physical,\u201d he says. \u201cIt is good to play in both. I just try to adapt and enjoy myself. They want me to play like I play. Sevilla put a lot of intensity into the pressing without the ball. That\u2019s what Lopetegui asks me to do. He\u2019s a good manager, you can see it on the touchline; he really lives the game and that gives you energy.  \u201cIt\u2019s a good thing to have different coaches because you have to adapt and work more. When it\u2019s a new coach, you have to show more because he doesn\u2019t know you so it was a good thing for me. I don\u2019t care what people say about me really,\u201d he continues, laughing. \u201cI was just going here to win and to help them.\u201d Sevilla have not lost in La Liga since defeat at Madrid in November, the day before Rangnick took over at United. Martial\u2019s signing and the refusal to sell Diego Carlos reflected an awareness that an opportunity had opened before them. But, hit by injuries, they have drawn six of their past eight league games \u2013 four of six since Martial\u2019s arrival. That has seen Sevilla\u2019s title challenge falter and on Monday night Real Madrid pulled 10 points clear. \u201cBut the objective from the club is not to win the league,\u201d Martial maintains. \u201cWe\u2019re in a very good position but the objective is not La Liga: we\u2019re very happy to be in a good position, in second place. The target? To qualify for the Champions League.\u201d And then there\u2019s the Europa League, in which Sevilla travel to London with a 1-0 lead over West Ham from the first leg. This is a competition they have made their own and through which they have built an identity, cementing their place among the continent\u2019s biggest clubs. As they say there, \u201cno one loves it like we do\u201d.  Sevilla have won six of the past 16 Uefa Cups/Europa Leagues, and this year\u2019s final will be held at their Ram\u00f3n S\u00e1nchez Pizju\u00e1n stadium. \u201cIt\u2019s very important for them and so it is important for us to do what we can to win this cup, and the final is here,\u201d Martial says.  It would be some way to bow out again, six months after walking in, happy again. Because while the Manchester United striker hints at the hope of a more permanent solution he admits his stay at Sevilla is not likely to last much longer. \u201cI asked United to leave because I wanted to play but I still have a contract. They know what I want, so we will see at the end of the season,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m here just for the end of the season and that\u2019s it.\u201d"

                    "body": "Twickenham felt a little different on Saturday afternoon. It was the same walk from the station, by the same stalls on the Whitton Road, past the same faces, under the same sort of sombre February weather, to watch an England team made up, in the large part, of the same names that have been on and off the teamsheets here for the last few years. It was the air around the place that had changed. People were unsure exactly what to expect from the afternoon ahead except that, whatever else, it would at least be something unlike what they\u2019ve seen from England here recently. That promise didn\u2019t last all that long. Twenty minutes after kick-off, things were feeling more than a little familiar again. And when it was all over, everyone was left facing the same old conclusion, too. England have an awful lot of work to do if they\u2019re ever going to be anything like as good as people around here seem to believe they ought to be. They\u2019ve now blown their shot at a grand slam in the opening round of the last four championships. They\u2019ve also lost to Scotland three times in a row, something that hasn\u2019t happened since the early 1970s.  Steve Borthwick had warned beforehand that England would make mistakes. But even he can\u2019t have expected there would be this many. England\u2019s handling was sloppy, their lineout misfired, twice, and, even more problematic, they missed an awful lot of tackles. There were, count them on your fingers, one, two, three, four, five in the space of just the few seconds it took Duhan van der Merwe to finish Scotland\u2019s second try. It was one of the great ripping-roaring scores, a jinking sprint from inside his own half that left English tacklers throwing themselves around like they were trying to grab a greased piglet. And for the England fans, it was as excruciating as watching a man chase after his own hat. Their side missed 20 tackles altogether, more than one out of every 10 they attempted. There were two more of them in the run-up to Ben White\u2019s try, when he slid by Ben Curry then stepped Freddie Steward, and another couple before Van der Merwe scored their fourth try to win it in the 74th minute, when he bulldozed straight over Marcus Smith. Borthwick explained afterwards that they were still bedding in to their new defensive system. On this evidence, they\u2019re going to be spending an awful lot of time with their tackle bags between now and next weekend. Borthwick preferred to focus on what his team had done with the ball in hand. He said he felt they had made real progress in attack, and it was true that in amongst it all the helter-skelter chaos of the game, there were plenty of little glimpses of what England are capable of doing.  It was Max Malins who kicked them into gear after a torpid first quarter. Malins is one of a handful of players in this side who had been burned by Eddie Jones. He was dropped from the squad after England\u2019s defeat to Ireland in last year\u2019s championship, and wasn\u2019t seen again till Borthwick picked him. Borthwick suggested in the run-up to the game that Malins, and rest of Jones\u2019s rejects, had something to prove. Jones, such an unforgiving coach, pissed off so many people during his seven-year tenure that Borthwick could probably keep picking new men with grudges against him in every round of the championship. Malins made his point. He cut infield to meet a high kick, which he hacked downfield. Malins chased after it like a man sprinting downhill, his feet landing before his mind had time to tell them where to go, and, after hacking it on again, finally caught up with it in Scotland\u2019s 22. It launched a wave of 14 phases. Smith eventually worked out how to finish it when he lofted a high chip into the far corner. Malins looped around the back to catch it.  It was a fine try. Then Malins was on the end of England\u2019s second too. When Owen Farrell kicked a penalty, England went ahead for the first time, and when Ellis Genge crashed over the try-line in the minutes after half-time, they had an eight-point lead with 30 minutes left to play. As Borthwick said afterwards, they should probably have won it from there. But this Scotland team isn\u2019t easily beaten, and they snatched the match back again with that try by White, a penalty by Finn Russell and then that finishing blow by Van der Merwe. At least no one was booing England at the end, unlike last time out, when they lost to the Springboks. But the memory of tens of thousands of travelling fans chanting \u201cScot-land! Scot-land! Scot-land!\u201d probably won\u2019t have been so very much sweeter on the players\u2019 ears. One of the other changes England had made was that they played a little speech by Borthwick over the public address before the kick-off. He spoke sincerely, as he always does, he promised the fans \u201cpride\u201d and \u201cpassion\u201d. And England delivered it, too. But admirable as all that is, those qualities only go so far, and that\u2019s not nearly far enough when you make as many mistakes as England did, not against a team playing as well as Scotland."

                    "body": "The End Days of Twitter have provided plenty of entertainment lately \u2013 not least someone using Elon Musk\u2019s new paid-for checkmark system to impersonate Nintendo of America and tweet a picture of Mario flipping the bird. But the chaos that has enveloped the funniest and most infuriating social media platform of them all is also causing consternation for game artists, developers and marketers, many of whom view it as integral to their careers. Very Online millennials make up a huge proportion of the video game workforce, and plenty of us have been networking and snarking on Twitter for our entire careers. If the platform either goes away or changes beyond recognition, it will affect the games industry and how it socialises. Plenty of games have found real-world success through viral Twitter fame. Trombone Champ is only the latest example, elevated from the crowded field of weekly Steam releases with a tweet shared by PC Gamer. Untitled Goose Game \u2013 the beloved comedy game about a foul fowl \u2013 also picked up a huge audience there. And Cult of the Lamb is another recent game that owes at least some of its success to developers and fans\u2019 clever use of Twitter: it\u2019s the modern version of word-of-mouth. I have discovered countless games from seeing interesting clips on Twitter. It\u2019s where I first saw the Bafta-winning Unpacking. It\u2019s also where many journalists, streamers and publisher talent scouts hear about forthcoming games, and where players go to find out what\u2019s generating buzz. Video game Twitter is, like all of Twitter, replete with bad takes, toxicity and and self-indulgently long threads about nothing. But it\u2019s also full of developers sharing clips and screenshots from games they\u2019re working on, showing off their art, posting job opportunities when a big studio closes, sharing knowledge and boosting each others\u2019 work. Twitter has become a natural online home for people working in games: less staid than Facebook, more anarchic than Instagram, less segmented than Reddit. Almost every game developer I\u2019ve spoken to in the past few weeks has gotten at least one job opportunity through Twitter. This was particularly true for marginalised developers, who might not have the same access to real-life professional networks. \u201cTwitter has been my best networking tool for game dev and personal life,\u201d said indie developer Lucy Blundell. \u201cIt\u2019s my top marketing platform and way to connect with other devs. I just don\u2019t get the same connection with Discord, TikTok, Instagram, etc.\u201d Games industry Twitter is also a valuable social space for some: many developers mentioned the friends and colleagues they\u2019ve gotten to know through joining in on threads. \u201cMostly I\u2019m sad to lose what feels, despite everything else going on, like a really lovely community of people making games,\u201d said Tom Vian, of SFB Games (makers of personal fave Snipperclips, a genius co-op game on Switch, pictured below). \u201cI hope we can rebuild that.\u201d  We all know, of course, that Twitter can be extremely horrible, too. Ask any of the devs who get harassment and death threats there over minor perceived slights or changes to game balance in huge games like Destiny or Call of Duty. Depressingly, over the years plenty of studios have felt the need to make public statements asking people to stop sending developers abuse. With Twitter gone, would that abuse diminish? Or would it just find other vectors? I don\u2019t want to draw further unwanted attention to the individual people who\u2019ve been targets of abuse, but my own history with Twitter is inexorably tied up with Gamergate, the 2014 mass harassment campaign that targeted women and games journalists. I\u2019d experienced a lot of abuse on Twitter before that, from people who were so furious about a review score that they\u2019d send me explicit threats, but Gamergate concentrated the latent misogyny and organised it. Twitter did nothing about it. Nor did anyone else, really; a lot of people saw it as inconsequential blustering, rather than what it was: the new playbook for the alt-right culture wars. Things have improved on the platform. Most of the architects of Gamergate \u2013 among them the now-imprisoned Steve Bannon, and many of the staff of his rightwing website Breitbart News \u2013 were thrown off. But I could never really see Twitter as a town square again; it never felt like an entirely safe place to share jokes or make observations. But I never could quite let it go, because now and then something hilarious or brilliant would appear in my feed. But even if you could make the argument that Twitter has, overall, been good for the games industry, it\u2019s more difficult to argue that it\u2019s been good for society. \u201cIt\u2019s probably a bad thing for indie discoverability that Twitter is going down the pan, but it\u2019s probably best for everyone overall if it dies and is never resurrected,\u201d said one developer friend. \u201cI think all of us have taken some damage from something on Twitter that we would have otherwise avoided.\u201d PS: I had so many great responses to last week\u2019s newsletter about the joy of all-night gaming binges. Evidently plenty of you share my fondness for playing through the night. I wanted to share this reply in particular, from reader Debby: \u201cI have been a gamer for most of my adult life. I too remember staying up til the small hours while my children were asleep! What I would say is, don\u2019t leave it too long to fully indulge your gaming passion. I am 63 and thought I could just go on playing the same kind of games for ever \u2013 my favourites being Mass Effect, Fallout and The Last of Us, among many others. Lately, things are not as I had fantasised. My reactions are slower and my eyesight is not as it was, and I just don\u2019t have the stamina for all-nighters. I still work full-time, so maybe when I retire \u2026 I joke with my children that if they put me in a care home when I am really old, it has to have the latest PlayStation or it\u2019s not happening!\u201d Debby, I have joked many times about playing Mario Kart 64 all day with other rad old ladies when I\u2019m in a care home \u2013 assuming that we don\u2019t have fully immersive virtual reality a la San Junipero in Black Mirror by then. If the retirement communities of the future are full of lapsed gamers finally indulging their Civ habits, I\u2019m all for it. What to play  Pentiment, the new title from role-playing game specialists Obsidian Entertainment (Fallout: New Vegas, Pillars of Eternity, The Outer Worlds), does what no historical video game has done before: it imagines the lives of ordinary people living through immense societal change. Instead of playing a knight or a mythical hero, we play Andreas, an artist who illustrates manuscripts around the time the printing press is about to render his job obsolete. It\u2019s a murder mystery narrative game, really, one that works out differently depending on whom you befriend and whom you accuse. But it also imagines what it might have been like to arrive in Bavaria on the precipice of the Reformation. Available on: Xbox, PCApproximate playtime: 15 hours What to read  If you grew up watching Ash Ketchum continually try and fail to be the very best, like no one ever was, then your heart might be warmed by the news that 25 seasons into the Pok\u00e9mon anim\u00e9, the lovable trainer is now finally world champion. He\u2019s just a bit of a late bloomer. Animal Crossing: New Horizons on Switch is now Japan\u2019s bestselling game of all time, superseding the original Pok\u00e9mon Red and Green games. It has sold 10.45m copies in the region, and more than 40m globally. Tom Nook must be raking it in on all those mortgages. Remember how, after splitting with longtime partner EA Games, Fifa was going to team up with other developers to create even better games? Well, the first newly licensed Fifa products are a bunch of blockchain/NFT/metaverse products tied into the morally bankrupt Qatar World Cup. That went exactly as expected, then.  What to click Marvel Snap review \u2013 this superhero showdown card game is utterly compulsive \u201cI craved a bite-size experience\u201d: Ben Brode on the making of Marvel Snap The Case of the Golden Idol review \u2013 delicious Sherlockian murder mystery You can\u2019t out-shoot a teenager: how to play first-person shooters if you\u2019re over 30 Question block Reader David poses this week\u2019s question: \u201cWhat are some of your favourite games with time-rewind mechanics? And if you could rewind time once per day, would you go back five seconds, 30 minutes, or restart the day from when you woke up?\u201d  The least clever, but also most useful, implementation of a time-rewind in games is also one of the first: racing games. For casual racers like me, being able to rewind a few seconds and try again when you flub a corner or smash into an opponent on a single-player driving game turns the genre from an exercise in frustration into a carefree thrill-ride. I also love how it works in the original Life Is Strange, a teen drama with a supernatural twist: who among us, as impulsive teenagers, would not have loved the ability to rewind a few seconds to cram the thing you just said back into your mouth? In real life, I\u2019d pick 30 minutes: long enough to go back and order a different option on the restaurant menu, for when I inevitably get food envy, but probably not long enough to mess with the very fabric of time, space and consequence."

                    "body": "It was about Gareth Bale. If it was about Wales, it was always going to be about Bale. He may have played only 22 minutes of football in the 10 weeks since the playoff semi-final win over Austria; he may not be able to last anything like a full game; he may in effect have become a former player as far as Real Madrid are concerned; but he is still the player who makes Wales more than just another mid\u2011ranking side.\nThere will be those who have their subjective preferences for John Charles or Ryan Giggs, Ivor Allchurch or Ian Rush, but what can be said now is that nobody has ever achieved more in a Wales shirt. It is not just that he inspired them to reach the semi-finals of the European Championship and to secure a first qualification for a World Cup in 64 years. It is that he achieved those feats six years apart. Remnants remain but this is an obviously different side from Chris Coleman\u2019s and Bale has been key to both of them.\n\nWhen Bale lined up a free-kick 11 minutes before half-time, minds inevitably went back to the free-kick he had swept into the same goal against Austria in March. This time, on the other side of the pitch, Bale stood on the tee and assessed the conditions: 25 yards, slight left to right breeze, heavy rain. He selected his club, glanced at the target and the wall that stood in the way, went through his pre-shot routine, took his swing and then celebrated as a plunging Andriy Yarmolenko diverted the ball past his own goalkeeper \u2013 which admittedly seldom happens in golf.\nBale is a player these days who plays in snippets. He does not dominate matches as he once did. He is 32 and, while his dearth of regular football may perhaps prolong his career \u2013 if he wants it to \u2013 it also means a lack of basic match fitness. Yet somehow the game still revolves around him, as though the idea of Bale is enough to exert a gravitational force. And every now and again he will pluck a ball from the air with an extended foot or discover an angle that nobody else had seen to renew the strength of that idea.\n\nBut it was not quite all about Bale. It was also about Wayne Hennessey\u2019s athleticism and sure handling in the rain, about Neco Williams\u2019s diligence at left-back, about Joe Allen and Dan James scurrying tirelessly through midfield and a dozen bodies thrown in the way of shots.\nAnd it was also about singing. What an asset Wales have in their choral tradition. As soon as things get tense they can just flip through the hymn book and start singing something stirring and melodic, an inspiration to those on the pitch and a distraction for those off it. And that, perhaps, is part of what makes Welsh football so enjoyable at the moment, both for fans and for players. There is a sense of togetherness, of fresh peaks being scaled together, that is extremely rousing.\n\nAs before the win against Austria in Wales\u2019s playoff semi\u2011final, Dafydd Iwan, the grandson of one of the founders of Plaid Cymru, performed Yma o Hyd (\u201cStill Here\u201d). His song is about the defiant spirit of Welsh identity and how it remains strong even after almost half a millennium of union with England. But Ukrainian fans, too, perhaps found resonance in its words: \u201cWe are still here, in spite of everyone and everything.\u201d\nAnd there we run straight into the awkwardness of the occasion. How can the outcome of a football match compete with news about the counterattack in Sievierodonetsk? How can these things occupy the heads and hearts of the same people at the same time? And yet they do. Football is trivial and yet it matters \u2014 as an escape, yes, but also as something more, as a symbol of, well, whatever it needs to be.\n\nUkraine\u2019s fans, who seemed determined to enjoy every second of being Ukrainian in a public space, held flags aloft throughout Iwan\u2019s rendition; joined in a communal assertion of self. This surely is what fans want, what football is about, rather than the confected corporate nonsense of a Camila Cabello concert seemingly designed for those who are there less for the game than the spectacle. The Ukrainian fans were remembered at the final whistle, both by the Wales players who applauded them, and by Welsh fans who joined in their thunderclap: moving gestures that should not be forgotten.\n\nPopular sentiment was perhaps behind Ukraine but that should not detract from Welsh joy. They have waited a long time for this. They have endured the Joe Jordan handball, the Davie Cooper penalty, the Paul Bodin miss.\nThat those moments feel obstacles that have been overcome rather than part of an inevitable and ongoing curse is a measure of what Bale and his side have achieved."

                    "body": "  8.48am    Australia stay top of the World Cup table with five wins from five starts, ahead of South Africa who they will play on Tuesday before finishing off with Bangladesh. India also play Bangladesh and South Africa in their remaining pool matches, and are sitting in fourth spot hovering above the drop. They will need to win both those matches to qualify for the semi-finals. That\u2019s it from us today, thanks for your company.     8.44am   Australia win by six wickets  The unbeaten World Cup streak rolls on, and the biggest ever World Cup chase is completed. The match did get closer than one might have expected, with India able to push it into the final over. But eight runs from six balls was always likely to favour Australia, and India would have needed a wicket in that final over to sneak a win.  Put most of it down to Australia\u2019s openers, who scored 121 at better than a run a ball to give the rest of their order latitude. Another century partnership followed between the old firm of Lanning and Perry. Mooney has elevated herself to the very top tier of international players in the last three years or so, and finished it off. India\u2019s recovery with the bat was very good, but against this batting line-up, even their big score looked a bit light on a nice batting surface.     8.40am    50th over: Australia 280-4 (Mooney 30, McGrath 0) Beth Mooney is ice cold. Ice cold. This is exactly like her big chase against India in Queensland last September. First ball of the over, advances at Goswami and plonks her over wide long-on for four! Exactly the spot she hits so often when she needs a boundary. A straight length ball from Goswami exactly the ticket. Then Mooney goes through point, drawing a fumble from the fielder thanks to the pressure of Mooney\u2019s pace between the wickets. Two runs. And she finishes it off with a straight hit down the ground for four. What a star.      8.38am    49th over: Australia 270-4 (Mooney 20, McGrath 0) One ball to come in the over as Tahlia McGrath walks out. Meghna Singh bowls a wide, very wide of off stump, but McGrath is so fixated on looking to score that she throws bat at it, having walked across. She hits it straight to backward point along the ground. Dot ball. Australia need 8 from the last over.      8.36am   WICKET! Lanning c Vastrakar b Meghna 97, Australia 270-4  Well, well, well. Three singles from the over, both Australians trying to beat the boundary riders and failing, before Meghna bowls width. Lanning aims the square drive, trying to beat those backward points, but gets a thick dipping edge. Great catch by Vastrakar diving forward. This is tight!  Updated at 8.36am GMT    8.32am    48th over: Australia 267-3 (Lanning 96, Mooney 18) Lanning thinking about a century perhaps, swishes at Goswami and misses wide of off. Gets the next one, square of the sweeper behind point and they get back for a second run. Goswami persists with that line, and the two backward points are in business. Once they block Lannings shot, twice, three times! Last ball she drives to cover and there\u2019s no run. So she loses the strike, can\u2019t get the ton, and Australia now need 11 from 12. The game matters much more than someone\u2019s milestone, so expect to see Mooney go for it.     8.28am    47th over: Australia 265-3 (Lanning 94, Mooney 18) Meghna Singh returns with two overs of her allotment left. Been expensive, 57 from eight overs so far. Adds to that with a couple of singles and then a Mooney carve backward of point. Lanning gets strike, then sprints to keep it from the last ball, tapped to cover.      8.24am    46th over: Australia 257-3 (Lanning 92, Mooney 12) Jhulan Goswami has three overs left and will start that sequence now. Starts with a Lanning run behind point. Brings in a wide slip for the left-hander, but Mooney just taps and runs a single to mid-off. Lanning back-cuts a good line to the deep third sweeper. Bottom-handed whack from Mooney finds mid-on. Late cut for one. Then Lanning picks the gap! Just like last time. The singles, the singles, then Australia\u2019s captain sizes up the gap, gets just enough width, and places it behind point, too square for deep third, too fine for deep cover.  21 from 24.     8.19am    45th over: Australia 249-3 (Lanning 86, Mooney 10) Crashed by Mooney! Advances at Gayakwad and flat-bats the spinner through midwicket. Takes a fast two followed by a single. Lanning drives a run to deep cover to keep the strike, and Gayakwad finishes with 0 for 48 from her ten overs. Vastrakar took 2 for 43.  29 from 30.     8.17am    44th over: Australia 241-3 (Lanning 85, Mooney 3) Vastrakar to bowl her last over, and Lanning glides a run to deep third as she has so many times in her long career. Mooney advances and tries to find the boundary through wide long on, but can only get one. Lanning leans back to cut, and there is the sweeper once again. Mooney drops and runs to point. And finally the one to pierce the field comes. Enough width for Lanning to throw her hands through it, her scything square drive, behind point this time for four. Australia need 37 from 36.      8.12am    43rd over: Australia 233-3 (Lanning 79, Mooney 1) Gayakwad turns one past the edge for the third time today, though this time Lanning plays the line and isn\u2019t at much risk of nicking. Anchored to the crease, she can only dig out the next couple, then Mooney calls her through for a sharp single. Mooney can\u2019t beat the field, and that makes the equation 45 from 42 balls.      8.09am    42nd over: Australia 232-3 (Lanning 78, Mooney 1) Australia aren\u2019t fazed. Beth Mooney gets off strike first ball she faces. Lanning pulls a half-hearted half-tracker for four, then takes a run to keep the strike. That leaves 46 to win.  Updated at 8.12am GMT    8.08am   WICKET! Perry c Raj b Vastrakar 28, Australia 226-3  First over back, another century stand comes to an end for Lanning and Perry. Nine of them now, in their career. The most ever is Rolton and Keightley with ten. Perry gets cramped for room against a high full toss and squeezes it to cover for a catch.     8.03am    We\u2019ll be back on in a few minutes.     8.00am    While we\u2019re waiting, it\u2019s a good time to make some observations about the Lanning-Perry partnership in broader terms. Today they went past 2000 runs together, currently on 2024.  There are only five more prolific pairings in women\u2019s ODI cricket. Charlotte Edwards and Claire Taylor, Lizelle Lee and Laura Wolvaardt, Suzie Bates and Amy Satterthwaite, Deandra Dottin and Stafanie Taylor, and Belinda Clark and Lisa Keightley.  Most of those are within 500 runs ahead of the Australian pair, except for Clark and Keightley on 3339.  Lanning and Perry have batted together 27 times. The other pairings have batted together respectively 58, 51, 52, 59, and 67 times.  Lanning and Perry average 101.50 right at the moment. The next best of those above them is 52.17.   Updated at 8.49am GMT    7.55am    They only put down the pitch cover, not the whole square, and now they\u2019re taking that cover off.      7.45am   Rain delay  That was sudden. The rain starts coming down fairly heavily. Australia are well ahead of the par score on the rain calculations, 28 runs there.      7.43am    41st over: Australia 225-2 (Lanning 73, Perry 28) A concussion protocol delay after Perry misses a sweep and pops it up into the grille of her helmet, but she\u2019s fine. The second ball in a row that she was beaten by Gayakwad, who had previously scooted a ball past an attempted cut shot. Only a scampered single from the over. Australia need 53 from 54.      7.39am    40th over: Australia 224-2 (Lanning 73, Perry 27) Vastrakar has been the standout for India today, batted well and has bowled with heart. Only two singles for her over as she tries to clamp down, but Australia still only need 54 from 60.      7.37am    39th over: Australia 222-2 (Lanning 72, Perry 26) Sprinting from Perry to start the over, who hits Goswami through point and hares back for the second. The Australians have picked on Harmanpreet in the field all night, taking on her arm. Perry ends the over by nailing a straight drive along the ground that is so well hit that it bursts through the fingertips of mid-on and is barely diverted on its way to the boundary.      7.31am    38th over: Australia 211-2 (Lanning 69, Perry 19) Perry goes in the air, short of the deep midwicket rushing in. One run. More for Lanning, flicking Rana through fine leg for four, improvising that shot against a decent enough delivery. 67 to win.     7.28am    37th over: Australia 204-2 (Lanning 64, Perry 17) Good length from Goswami, who has Perry almost feathering a catch behind from a hard-handed drive. India try to crowd Lanning with two backward points, while Goswami bowls outside off stump encouraging Lanning to hit there. 74 to win.     7.23am    36th over: Australia 201-2 (Lanning 62, Perry 16) For a lot of teams, 81 from 90 balls would be a challenging end to a chase. For these Australians it feels like a foregone conclusion. The pitch is good for batting, some pace and bounce in it, and India have not been able to tighten the snare for any meaningful period of time. Four runs from the Rana over, Australia\u2019s score passes 200.     7.20am    35th over: Australia 197-2 (Lanning 59, Perry 15) Goswami bowls a Test match line, Lanning throws a one-day shot at it, and gets a safe edge through an empty slip area for four. 81 runs to go.     7.18am   Half century! Lanning 51 from 56 balls  34th over: Australia 191-2 (Lanning 54, Perry 14) A miscued shot for the milestone, Lanning getting a skew through the off side while trying to work Rana to leg, but it\u2019s safe. The relentless march of Australia\u2019s captain continues.      7.16am    33rd over: Australia 185-2 (Lanning 49, Perry 13) Goswami comes back on for a tentative bowl: hasn\u2019t done so since three early overs and an ankle problem. The Australians respectfully take a couple of singles.      7.13am    32nd over: Australia 183-2 (Lanning 48, Perry 12) Meghna Singh has had a bad night. Short and wide again, crashed through point for four. Then draws an error from a short ball but the top edge goes fine for another boundary. Lanning draws near to a fifty.      7.02am    31st over: Australia 171-2 (Lanning 39, Perry 10) Time for Lanning to have a crack, she decides, with a big slog sweep over backward square leg for four. Shafali Verma in the deep almost gets around to catch that, but not quite. The singles keep coming either side of that shot.   Updated at 7.09am GMT    7.00am    30th over: Australia 164-2 (Lanning 34, Perry 8) Another controlled over from Gayakwad after the break, two singles from it. The required rate is out to 5.7 now and the actual rate has dipped below that. Easy for Australia to make up the gap, of course, but it does at least show that the scoring has slowed. If India could find another wicket then they would be some chance of increasing the pressure.     6.53am    29th over: Australia 162-2 (Lanning 33, Perry 7) Four for Lanning, carving a cut shot from Sneh Rana\u2019s off-spin. Rana smiles, what more can she do? But she follows up with a much faster straight delivery that Lanning only just keeps out of her pads. Smart bowling. Drinks, with 116 needed to win.      6.52am    28th over: Australia 156-2 (Lanning 28, Perry 6) Take on the seamer, not yet the spinner. Both players are cautious against Gayakwad, and with Lanning stretching forward to defend, the left-arm spinner once more turns a ball that kicks and just beats the edge of the bat. She\u2019s bowled a couple of pearlers as well as some loose stuff.      6.47am    27th over: Australia 154-2 (Lanning 27, Perry 5) Lanning wrenches the run rate back Australia\u2019s way as Meghna Singh returns, bowling short and carved away off the top edge through deep third for one four, then smoked out of the middle through point for another. 124 to win.   Updated at 6.48am GMT    6.46am    26th over: Australia 144-2 (Lanning 18, Perry 4) Just the two runs from Gayakwad\u2019s over of spin, and for the first time in the innings the required rate has crept above the current rate at around 5.5 an over.      6.42am    25th over: Australia 142-2 (Lanning 17, Perry 3) Another bouncer from Vastrakar, this time way over Lanning\u2019s head. Wide. Lanning finds another boundary with her square drive, then Perry is nearly run out after defending back to Vastrakar with a step forward out of her crease. Vastrakar was sharp enough to fire back at the stumps, but just missed, and Perry was snaking her foot back to safety. Halfway point. 136 to win.     6.38am    24th over: Australia 135-2 (Lanning 12, Perry 2) India slowing things down for a moment, only two from the Gayakward over. Must take advantage of this to press for another wicket, rather than letting these two build.     6.36am    23rd over: Australia 133-2 (Lanning 11, Perry 1) Perry glides a single to get going, Lanning adds a two and a one. Goswami is back on the field.      6.31am    22nd over: Australia 129-2 (Lanning 8, Perry 0) A strange shot from Lanning to start the partnership, a little pick-up pull to a ball that was too full and outside off from Rana, just clearing short fine leg. But she gets things moving properly with a classy square drive for four.     6.27am    21st over: Australia 123-2 (Lanning 2) The good news for India: both the set openers are gone. The bad news: they have brought together the most successful chasing partnership in one-day history, Lanning and Ellyse Perry.      6.25am   WICKET! Haynes c Ghosh b Vastrakar 43, Australia 123-2  Two in two overs! Great ball from Vastrakar. She had bowled that good bumper to Haynes in the previous over, and follows it up with another. Pace, lift, and Haynes flinches at it, playing a pull shot with her eyes off the ball. It takes a little touch of the bat through to Ghosh behind the wicket.      6.20am    20th over: Australia 122-1 (Haynes 43, Lanning 1) Get rid of Healy, welcome Lanning. The Australian skipper sees out the over, driving a straight single from the last ball.     6.19am   WICKET! Healy c Raj b Rana 72, Australia 121-1  At last, India get something. The off-spinner bowls outside off stump, Healy pulls out the reverse sweep, and clouts it straight to the fielder behind point. Good catch, if a little strange in technique, overhead while down on one knee. Australia\u2019s opening stand has gone at well past six per over, while the required rate is down at five.      6.17am    19th over: Australia 118-0 (Haynes 41, Healy 71) Short of options, Mithali Raj goes back to Vastrakar. Who bowls a good over, a zippy bouncer in there to Haynes, and only two singles.      6.11am    18th over: Australia 118-0 (Haynes 41, Healy 71) More trouble for India with Jhulan Goswami limping from the ground. She had some problem with her ankle, got boundary-line treatment, but now is leaving the arena. Sneh Rana gets worked for a single per ball, plus a brace for Healy.     6.09am    17th over: Australia 111-0 (Haynes 39, Healy 66) More spin as Gayakwad comes back on, and more runs as Healy bashes two sweep shots in a row through square to the boundary. The team hundred comes up at more than six per over. This team is like the Australian men\u2019s teams of 20 years ago, bullying every opponent in cricket terms. Healy sweeps another boundary with more finesse. India get desperate enough to burn another lbw review, this one pitching outside leg stump. 14 runs from the over.     6.02am    16th over: Australia 97-0 (Haynes 39, Healy 54) One quiet over is all that Sneh Rana gets, as the Australians attack her next. Haynes and Healy both come down the pitch to hit straight, the former picking up four runs, the latter three. India try a review from the last ball of the over, but with the off-spinner bowling around the wicket, the ball hitting Haynes in front of the stumps is going down the leg side.     5.54am   Half century! Alyssa Healy 50 from 49 balls  15th over: Australia 88-0 (Haynes 34, Healy 50) Meghna Singh not enjoying the work of the umpires: wided for a sharp bouncer that wasn\u2019t far over Healy\u2019s head, then an lbw shout turned down. That ball was also too high. Healy charges off for another risky single and again the throw from midwicket misses the stumps. That run is Healy\u2019s 50th for the innings. Drinks.     5.51am    14th over: Australia 85-0 (Haynes 33, Healy 49) Sneh Rana on to bowl, the off-spinner putting no pace on the ball and getting some drift in the air. Keeps them to two singles from the over.      5.45am    13th over: Australia 83-0 (Haynes 32, Healy 48) Meghna Singh around the wicket to the lefty, trying something different to Haynes, who nails one cut shot for four but skews another push in the air through cover for a risky run. Survives.     5.42am    12th over: Australia 76-0 (Haynes 27, Healy 47) Five runs from the Vastrakar over, Healy working a couple of twos around. She hasn\u2019t had much strike lately, so she has quietened down. Haynes could have been run out to start that over, hitting the ball straight to mid-off and running, but Harmanpreet\u2019s underarm diving forward has no pace on it and lobs over the stumps.  Updated at 5.43am GMT    5.37am    11th over: Australia 71-0 (Haynes 26, Healy 43) Meghna Singh returns after the fielding restrictions are lifted, and has changed ends. Richa Ghosh comes up to the stumps to stop the Australians wandering about. Meghna twice bowls wide down the leg side: that\u2019s the last thing India\u2019s bowlers need to add to their effort. Eventually she asks Ghosh to stand back instead, and the only concedes two runs off the bat.      5.31am    10th over: Australia 67-0 (Haynes 25, Healy 42) \u201cWatch the ball,\u201d Haynes mouths to herself as Vastrakar runs in, and she does so. Vastrakar again proves the most demanding of the bowlers, five in a row on a good length that keeps Haynes quiet, but the final ball drops short and Haynes punishes the pull shot so effectively that it goes to the boundary through through wide long on.     5.27am    9th over: Australia 63-0 (Haynes 21, Healy 42) Turn past the outside edge for Gayakwad! Gets it past Healy\u2019s outside edge by a micron, and nearly has her stumped too but Healy on the big forward stretch just keeps her back toe anchored. A poor ball to follow though, down leg side again and knocked away fine for three with Goswami eventually saving a boundary with her boot. Drops short to Haynes who carves away four with a cut shot. India can\u2019t stop the scoring. A single follows with a misfield from the bowler, through her hands.      5.23am    8th over: Australia 53-0 (Haynes 16, Healy 37) Another bowling change with the seam of Pooja Vastrakar, the all-rounder who has made a big impression since touring Australia last September. Big hitter with the bat, but is at least at this stage primarily a bowler. Hits her length, importantly, with an off-stump line and the Australians only score a scrambled single and a sliced two.     5.19am    7th over: Australia 50-0 (Haynes 14, Healy 36) Australia flying at more than seven runs per over, and Mithali Raj brings on her left-arm spinner, Rajeshwari Gayakwad. Wearing her broad black headband, bouncing up to the crease, usually around the wicket whether to stances right or left. She\u2019s had a good tournament so far, and bowls a good over up until the final ball, which is outside leg stump for Haynes and deflected on the paddle sweep for four.      5.16am    6th over: Australia 43-0 (Haynes 9, Healy 34) A bit of circumspection from Healy with Meghna Singh bowling wide, swinging it away with the field stacked behind point, making it dangerous to glide the ball away. But when Meghna bowls a similar ball too full, Healy thrashes another cover drive for four. Then nearly runs herself out! Hits it straight to point, Yastika Bhatia I think it was collecting a one-bounce ball, but can\u2019t get rid of the throw quickly enough, taking an extra step to steady herself first. Healy reaches the non-striker\u2019s end, and the ball misses anyway. A faster direct hit would have had her.      5.12am    5th over: Australia 38-0 (Haynes 9, Healy 29) The Australian keeper is really off to a fast start. Goswami bowls too short to Healy, who cracks a pull shot and then a cut shot to the boundary, back to back.      5.06am    4th over: Australia 29-0 (Haynes 9, Healy 20) More aggression from Healy against Meghna, as she sees some width. Drives on the up, throws her hands hard at the line, and that means the shot goes in the air through cover. But she gets lucky with the placement and picks up four. Then gets luckier with an outside edge that goes wide of slip for a single to deep third. Against the left-hander the swing bowler is bringing the ball into the pads, startling Haynes with some bounce as well. But Meghna Singh then offers a poor delivery, dragged down hard and bouncing well wide of off stump. Haynes can larrup it over point and get back for three runs.      5.03am    3rd over: Australia 20-0 (Haynes 6, Healy 14) The Australians are happy to pick off Goswami for modest returns early in the day, knocking singles and a two for Haynes behind square leg. Nothing aggressive.      5.01am    2nd over: Australia 15-0 (Haynes 3, Healy 12) A good mix of aggression with patience from Healy, seeing out a few balls from Meghna Singh, but putting away an errant ball through fine leg for four, then driving three through cover.      4.57am    1st over: Australia 6-0 (Haynes 1, Healy 5) We\u2019re off to the races. Jhulan Goswami has the ball in hand, India\u2019s heartbeat, the tall seam bowler who leads the world by a mile in one-day wickets. She hits a good line as she almost always does, and a decent length except when she overpitches one ball for Healy to drive through cover for four.      4.39am    Hello all, thanks Megan for taking us through. That was quite the performance from India, after a campaign that has been hit and miss. The Australians have been mowing down huge totals though, so it\u2019s very much in their reach. Looking forward to the reply.      4.30am   India 277-7  Well, that was a very exciting innings! There were plenty of swings in momentum, with Australia and India both taking the ascendancy at different times. Australia is now chasing 278, which would be a world record run chase in a World Cup if they got there. But the way they have looked this tournament, they\u2019re very capable of making that look easy. India had a lot of batters stand up for them today - Mithali and Bhatia set it up, before Kaur came in and dominated, ably assisted by Vastrakar who played her role extremely well. This is certainly looking like the good India have turned up for today\u2019s game, so they will be looking to take that momentum into their bowling innings. It\u2019s been enthralling match so far and we\u2019re only halfway through it. I\u2019m going to hand you over to my very excellent colleague Geoff Lemon, who will be your tour guide for Australia\u2019s batting innings. It\u2019s been delightful to spend this innings with you, thanks for your company and your emails!     4.23am    50th over: India 277-7 (Harmanpreet Kaur 57) Jonassen bowls the last over and India are pushing for a strong finish. They\u2019re running hard and pushing for twos, but the boundaries they\u2019d like aren\u2019t coming to them. They can\u2019t find a boundary this over, but they squeeze every run they can out of it, Kaur finishing not out and Vastrakar sacrificing herself, run out from the last ball of the innings.     4.21am   WICKET! Pooja Vastrakar 34 ro Jonassen, India 277-7  They take the gamble for the last ball of the over and it doesn\u2019t pay off, with Jonassen taking an easy run out, but it was an excellent partnership at the end for India.     4.17am    49th over: India 269-6 (Harmanpreet Kaur 52, Pooja Vastrakar 31) Schutt takes the penultimate over and Kaur punches the first ball down the ground. Perry comes in to cut it off, but she fumbles it and very nearly gives her a boundary assist. There\u2019s an LBW appeal next ball, but it\u2019s ruled to be going down leg and then Healy has a chance for a direct hit run out at the bowler\u2019s end, but she misses the stumps. Australia decides to review for the LBW, but the umpire made the right call originally and India stay in the fight. Vastrakar has a big swipe at the next ball, putting it in the air over mid off and Healy calls out for a catch, but it falls safely and it\u2019s an easy two. Late in the over she smashes an 81 metre six over long on and finishes with a single.  Updated at 4.25am GMT    4.11am    48th over: India 257-6 (Harmanpreet Kaur 50, Pooja Vastrakar 22) Jonassen thinks she might have an LBW first ball, but the angle isn\u2019t there for that opportunity. A flurry of singles follows and Kaur finishes the over by bringing up her 50 in an excellent effort for her team.  Updated at 4.25am GMT    4.09am    47th over: India 251-6 (Harmanpreet Kaur 47, Pooja Vastrakar 20) Schutt takes this over and India\u2019s run rate has bounced back over five, which she will be looking to pull back. But Kaur isn\u2019t intimidated and as soon as Vastrakar gets her on strike, she pulls a ball that splits the fielders to race over the boundary. Vastrakar pulls one of her own, but she doesn\u2019t quite time it and it\u2019s just a single. Kaur drives another one down the ground, bringing up the 250 for India. Vastrakar mistimes another shot, but she takes another single and they\u2019re keeping the score ticking over, which is so important at this stage of the match.  Updated at 4.25am GMT    4.05am    46th over: India 242-6 (Harmanpreet Kaur 41, Pooja Vastrakar 17) King is bowling her 10th over and Kaur immediately punches the ball straight down the ground, where it evades Mooney to zoom over the boundary for four. She follows it up with another shot down the ground, but this one is just a single to give Vastrakar the strike. Vastrakar is pleased with the opportunity and has seen the way Kaur has been scoring down the ground and decides she wants a piece of that action and drives it down that way for six. King bowls a wide one that is judged too wide, but Healy appeals for a stumping from it. Vastrakar is safely in her crease though and she punches the next one down the ground for four, noticing Mooney has come up and there is space down there. She finishes the over with a single, bringing up 17 from the over  Updated at 4.24am GMT    3.59am    45th over: India 225-6 (Harmanpreet Kaur 36, Pooja Vastrakar 6) The run rate has dropped below five an over and India will need to address that to ensure they put on a defendable total. They\u2019re striking the ball hard, but Schutt continues to bowl well to her field. Kaur shows her intent on the third ball and and urges Vastrakar through for a second run where previously they would have only taken one. India aren\u2019t interested in allowing any dot balls this over and it\u2019s not until the last ball that Schutt gets one.  Updated at 4.24am GMT    3.56am    44th over: India 219-6 (Harmanpreet Kaur 34, Pooja Vastrakar 2) Kaur gets a ball on the toe of the bat on the first ball of King\u2019s over and they run hard for two. She gives them a big opportunity from the second ball with a top edge and Mooney looks like she will take it easily, but she needed to take one more step to secure the ball and she throws her hands at it instead and it slips through her fingers. Kaur will want to use that reprieve and make Australia pay for that drop, but King keeps building the pressure with dot balls and keeps Kaur off strike.  Updated at 4.24am GMT    3.53am    43rd over: India 215-6 (Harmanpreet Kaur 31, Pooja Vastrakar 1) Jonassen has immediate impact and removes Rana from the first ball and Vastrakar gets off strike after a couple of attempts, knowing Kaur needs to face as many balls as possible to finish this innings. On the final ball of the over she sweeps hard for a single to hold on to the strike.  Updated at 4.24am GMT    3.50am   WICKET! Sneh Rana 1 b Jonassen, India 213-6  Jonassen strikes immediately at the start of her second spell, beating Rana\u2019s bat and sending her on her way for just the one run.     3.49am    42nd over: India 213-5 (Harmanpreet Kaur 30, Sneh Rana 1) King strikes from the first ball of the over, dismissing Richa and bring Sneh Rana to the crease. Rana takes a few balls to settle in as Australia looks to keep her on strike, knowing how dangerous a set Kaur can be. They do a good job of it for three balls and then Rana manages to get down the other end from a leg bye, but Kaur can\u2019t score from the final ball.   Updated at 4.24am GMT    3.46am   WICKET! Richa Ghosh 8 st Healy b King, India 212-5  Richa knows she has to go hard, so she comes charging down the wicket, but King spins it past her and Healy\u2019s quick hands take the bails off before Richa even knows the ball has gone past.     3.44am    41st over: India 212-4 (Harmanpreet Kaur 30, Richa Ghosh 8) We\u2019re into the last 10 overs and McGrath starts it with a low full toss, which is a gift to Kaur who sends it to the boundary for four. She takes a single from the next ball to get Richa on strike. McGrath offers a half volley to Richa and Kaur pushes her for two and they run well to make it. Kaur finishes the over with another sweep shot and this one goes all the way to the boundary for four. The run rate is creeping up and India will be working hard to keep it moving in that direction.  Updated at 4.23am GMT    3.40am    40th over: India 200-4 (Harmanpreet Kaur 21, Richa Ghosh 5) King resumes her spell and she will be buoyed by that wicket of Mithali. She\u2019ll have her eye on Kaur next, who is Australia\u2019s big concern heading into the final overs of the match. Kaur pulls out her sweep shot as soon as she gets on strike, but it only results in a single. Richa plays a clever scoop that almost makes it to the boundary and it should have been three runs, but they don\u2019t communicate well enough and it\u2019s only two.  Updated at 4.23am GMT    3.36am    39th over: India 196-4 (Harmanpreet Kaur 20, Richa Ghosh 2) India have brought their run rate up about five an over now and they will be looking to keep pushing that up. Their intent is clear from the first ball of Schutt\u2019s over as they turn what would have been a one at other points in this match into two. There\u2019s a big appeal for LBW on the second ball of the over. The umpire isn\u2019t interested, but Lanning decides to review. However the video shows that the ball clipped Kaur\u2019s glove and the umpire\u2019s decision stands. Healy goes for a stumping next ball, but Richa is well in her crease. A mix up with the running next ball nearly results in a run out, but McGrath hesitates on the throw and Richa is safe. It\u2019s a good over from Schutt, creating plenty of chances.  Updated at 4.23am GMT    3.31am    38th over: India 191-4 (Harmanpreet Kaur 17, Richa Ghosh 1) Another almost chance from the first ball of King\u2019s over, but again it falls short and Brown can only collect it on the bounce. King eventually strikes, removing the dangerous Mithali, which will be a big relief to the Australians late in this innings. Richa Ghosh comes to the crease and gets off the mark immediately, followed by Kaur taking a four and a single to finish the over.      3.28am   WICKET! Mithali Raj 68 c Perry b King, India 186-4  Finally Australia picks up the wicket of Mithali, who has been so important for India this innings. King gets her first wicket for the match and it\u2019s another easy catch for Perry at deep midwicket from a slog sweep that Mithali can\u2019t quite get under control.     3.26am    37th over: India 185-3 (Harmanpreet Kaur 11, Mithali Raj 68) Schutt comes back on to bowl now. She didn\u2019t take a wicket from her first spell, but she bowled well and kept the scoring low in the power play, so now may be her chance to strike if she is able to frustrate the batters by accumulating some dot balls. Singles from the first two balls tell us that the Indian batters aren\u2019t prepared to let that happen. A bit of a wayward shot from Mithali on the third ball looks like it might be a chance, but there are no fielders there to pick up a catch. Kaur plays a nice little scoop to fine leg, but a fielder is there to cut it off before it gets to the boundary.     3.22am    36th over: India 181-3 (Harmanpreet Kaur 9, Mithali Raj 66) King returns to the attack and Mithali goes after her straight away, with an aggressive sweep, but it doesn\u2019t clear the field and she just gets a single. Kaur comes to the party with her first boundary of the match - her trademark sweep shot past deep square leg for four. There\u2019s a chance for a caught and bowled with a leading edge late in the over, but it falls just short of King.     3.18am    35th over: India 176-3 (Harmanpreet Kaur 5, Mithali Raj 65) We\u2019re getting into crunch time for India now and Kaur will need to start matching Mithali and lifting the run rate now she has had a few overs to get her eye in. She starts the over with a single from Perry and Mithali keeps the strike rotating to give Kaur another shot. She plays a nice cut shot, but it\u2019s straight to the fielder. She doesn\u2019t look in any hurry just yet, but we know she has the power to go hard late in the innings. A pull shot from the next ball looks much more aggressive and she gets a run from this one, before Mithali plays a very fine one down to hold on to the strike for the next over.     3.15am    34th over: India 172-3 (Harmanpreet Kaur 3, Mithali Raj 63) Lanning continues with Brown, which is unsurprising as they would love to take another wicket and Brown is certainly the one they\u2019ll be looking to for that. A shorter ball early in the over strikes Kaur on the arm and ricochets into her helmet, but her arm took a lot of the impact and she isn\u2019t troubled by it. Brown is keeping her line very tight, she\u2019s certainly been the pick of the Australian bowlers today, even aside from the three wickets. But Mithali reads her beautifully from the last ball of the over, timing a ball perfectly to beat Perry on the boundary.      3.10am    33rd over: India 166-3 (Harmanpreet Kaur 2, Mithali Raj 57) Perry is back into the attack at the other end - will she have better control this time around? At this stage I think she\u2019d be happy with a six ball over instead of the 12 ball over she bowled last time around. She starts well and she prefers bowling to right handers, so this partnership will suit her better. Kaur gets off the mark, but Perry is only giving away singles, bowling well to her field. It\u2019s a good over from Perry, she will take a lot of confidence from that after her over to forget earlier in the match.     3.05am    32nd over: India 162-3 (Harmanpreet Kaur 0, Mithali Raj 56) Brown continues and Mithali chips one over the field, but it doesn\u2019t get past the field and it\u2019s just a single. But two balls later she lures Bhatia perfectly and picks up her third wicket. Mithali finds some space late in the over, but it\u2019s a beautiful save on the boundary from Schutt.  Updated at 3.10am GMT    3.03am    Jack Jorgensen however, disregarded my request for wrong answers only and has decided to give us a sensible suggestion. Hi Megan,Is Nasser commentating on Aus / Pak Men\u2019s Tests? I think that might be Rob Key\u2019s voice that sounds very similar to Nasser\u2019s.Go Aus!Cheers, Jack It\u2019s not what I was looking for, but helpful nonetheless. Thanks for your wisdom Jack.      3.02am    Drinks are on the field, so we have time to look at some answers to Kate Poole\u2019s question.  Hullo Megan Maurice,With re: Nasser Hussein appearing hither and thither, OBO 16-17 AUS-IND, me buddies have pondered over several theories, and have now finalised the likelihood that:Hussein is most definitely in tropical West Indies. Why would he be in the Land of Long White Clouds where the bones chill?Hussein has learnt the ancient art of assembling himself, just like the Indian Fakirs of yore did, from one place to another.Or it could be mirrors!Hope this answers Kate Poole\u2019s query.Be that it may, it is most enjoyable following the OBOs, so long \u2018ere may this continue!Bik M\u2019Path  I\u2019m a big fan of these answers, excellent work, thank you for your input.     3.01am   WICKET! Yastika Bhatia 59 c Perry b Brown, India 158-3  Finally Australia get their breakthrough and it\u2019s no surprise that it\u2019s Brown who manages it! Bhatia mistimes her drive and it\u2019s a very easy catch for Perry at deep point.     2.58am    31st over: India 157-2 (Yastika Bhatia 59, Mithali Raj 51) Well now is the traditional point where teams start to go big and push up their run rate. Let\u2019s see what India have in store with this very good partnership in place and plenty of wickets in hand. They run hard on the first ball, but Bhatia gets a ball to the helmet from the throw back and we pause while the necessary checks are done. She\u2019s all good and Gardner sends down another two wides, taking Australia\u2019s wide total to 23 for the match. Next ball Bhatia brings up her 50 with a wonderful shot past deep square leg for four. She tries something similar on the other side of the wicket next ball, but can\u2019t quite get hold of it. She looks to go down the ground after that, but that shot isn\u2019t on either, but eventually she is able to take advantage of a McGrath misfield to pick up two runs. On the final ball of the over she brings out an absolute delight of a shot, turning her wrists to get it extremely fine down to the boundary - it\u2019s beautiful to watch.     2.51am    30th over: India 144-2 (Yastika Bhatia 49, Mithali Raj 50) There was some nervousness about the weather prior to this game starting, but the sun is shining brightly now and Darcie Brown is back into the attack - the only Australian bowler who has taken wickets so far today. Again the Indians are playing just lovely looking shots, but so often they\u2019re only bringing one run. The Australians are bowling to their field very well, but they\u2019ll want to take some more wickets soon. Mithali brings up her half century late in the over, setting up a great platform to launch from late in this innings.      2.48am    29th over: India 141-2 (Yastika Bhatia 48, Mithali Raj 48) Bhatia is on the charge now against King with a slog and it looks like a six, but it bounces just in front of the rope for a very nice four instead. There\u2019s a little bit of a collision between King and Mithali on the third ball of the over as King dives to save a ball going past her and Mithali wants to get back in her crease quickly. But there\u2019s no harm done and they\u2019re both fine to play on. The Indians are looking very settled now, bringing up their highest ever third wicket partnership against Australia in this over.      2.44am    28th over: India 135-2 (Yastika Bhatia 43, Mithali Raj 47) Jonassen comes back into the attack now, with a change of ends. Bhatia looks very confident to start with a scoop to fine leg, before Mithali brings up the 100 partnership with a lovely sweep next ball. This is only the eighth 100 partnership that Australia have conceded in a World Cup match, so a very fine effort from these two. Mithali celebrates with a powerful six down the ground next ball.     2.40am    27th over: India 126-2 (Yastika Bhatia 41, Mithali Raj 40) Bhatia plays one straight back past King to start the over, but Haynes is out in the deep to save the boundary. The field moves in a bit for Mithali, but she takes a quick single and hands the strike back to Bhatia. It\u2019s a good over from King, just the three singles from it.      2.38am    26th over: India 123-2 (Yastika Bhatia 39, Mithali Raj 39) Bhatia looks assertive, if not aggressive, against McGrath straight up with a back foot steer to third. Mithali then plays a very nice drive to third that should have got her three runs, but Bhatia hesitates a little and they can only get two. McGrath joins the wide party and luckily Healy gets a glove on it, because it looked to be heading for the boundary. Bhatia cuts hard on the last ball of the over and it pierces the infield, but can\u2019t get past the outfield.      2.33am    25th over: India 115-2 (Yastika Bhatia 37, Mithali Raj 35) King takes her second over as we approach the halfway point of this innings. She has Mithali\u2019s measure early, starting with four dot balls and keeping her line very tight. The fourth is a little quicker and Healy thinks it might get past Mithali, but she plays it safely. She finally gets off strike next ball and Bhatia takes a quick single from the last.     2.31am    24th over: India 113-2 (Yastika Bhatia 36, Mithali Raj 34) Tahlia McGrath changes ends and comes from the southern end this time, starting just as consistently as she did from the northern end. Mithali slashes one away from the third ball of the over, getting the Australians interested in a catch, but it falls safely and is picked up by Haynes to keep it to two runs. There\u2019s a run out opportunity a few balls later but Bhatia manages to hurry back into her crease in time. She then punches one down the ground for four in very confident style.     2.27am    23rd over: India 104-2 (Yastika Bhatia 30, Mithali Raj 31) Alana King enters the attack for the first time this match, the seventh Australian bowler used so far today. She starts with a wide, but the next ball is better and Bhatia just manages a single from it. Her next three balls are good, but a fumble in the field from Jonassen gives away a single just as King as building some pressure.      2.24am    22nd over: India 101-2 (Yastika Bhatia 29, Mithali Raj 30) Mithali takes her opportunity straight away from Gardner\u2019s next over, guiding the ball beautifully past third for a boundary straight away. Gardner fights back with three dot balls and then Mithali gets one through the covers that races away, but the fielders restrict her to three.     2.21am    21st over: India 93-2 (Yastika Bhatia 28, Mithali Raj 23) Mithali looks to go that bit harder to start McGrath\u2019s over and it\u2019s in the air, but falls just short of King. She\u2019s looking more aggressive this over, but isn\u2019t getting the ball past the field. But both batters are keeping the runs coming and the strike rotating and aren\u2019t allowing Australia to accumulate too many dot balls against them.      2.18am    20th over: India 90-2 (Yastika Bhatia 27, Mithali Raj 21) Gardner and Healy both thought the first ball was going to clip leg stump, but it just misses and there\u2019s a single from the next ball. Again India are just rotating the strike and keeping up a decent run rate of 4.5 but as this partnership is settled, the time to go harder will arrive soon.     2.16am    19th over: India 86-2 (Yastika Bhatia 26, Mithali Raj 20) McGrath continues, looking to keep up her tight bowling and she starts well, bowling excellently to her field. Bhatia is playing some nice shots, but the fielders are cutting them off every time. Eventually she gets one away, but it\u2019s just a single to deep square leg. Mithali goes again for her favourite little pocket of the ground at deep extra cover, but she can\u2019t get it past Schutt.     2.11am    18th over: India 83-2 (Yastika Bhatia 25, Mithali Raj 18) Another over for Gardner and she\u2019s coming over the wicket. India will want to start getting a hurry on before too long, it looks like a good batting wicket and a fast outfield and we know how much batting power Australia has and how good they are at chasing. Gardner gives away two wides late in the over, with 18 wides now bowled by Australia so far this match. She finishes with a much tighter line.     2.07am    17th over: India 76-2 (Yastika Bhatia 23, Mithali Raj 18) Tahlia McGrath gets her first over now and she starts it very well, with four dot balls. Bhatia is eyeing her cautiously and is happy to block it out for a few balls before taking a single and handing the strike to Mithali. A good over from McGrath, just the one from it.     2.03am    While we take a quick break for drinks, Kate Poole poses an interesting question via email. Where in the world is Nasser Hussein?  I have theories on how he is managing to commentate for both women\u2019s World Cup and Aus/Pakistan men\u2019s tests1) he has a prototype transporter2) he has an identical twin and they\u2019ve been fooling the whole world for decades, sneakily changing places when no one is watching.Sure, the answer is likely that the commentary team is remote for one or both competitions, however I find this explanation somewhat dissatisfying.  If you\u2019ve got a theory, drop it in a tweet or email - wrong answers only.     2.01am    16th over: India 75-2 (Yastika Bhatia 22, Mithali Raj 18) Gardner takes another over and starts it well, with four dots on the trot. She\u2019s getting through the overs nice and quickly as well, which will please Lanning. Mithali plays a lovely shot on the fifth ball of the over, but she can\u2019t get it past the field. It\u2019s a maiden from Gardner.     2.00am    15th over: India 75-2 (Yastika Bhatia 22, Mithali Raj 18) Another over for Jonassen, coming over the wicket to start. Bhatia is rotating the strike nicely at the moment, but the Indians aren\u2019t going too hard yet, just taking the opportunities when they arise, not pushing the strike rate too much. Mithali finds one of those opportunities from the fourth ball, finding another one of those weird pockets of the ground past a quick outfield for a boundary. She decides she quite likes the weird pocket and sends it straight back there, but this time it\u2019s just three runs, well fielded by Tahlia McGrath.     1.57am    14th over: India 67-2 (Yastika Bhatia 21, Mithali Raj 11) Well we have our answer - Perry is going to take a break and Gardner takes over from her end. This serves the dual purposes of giving Perry some time to get her head back in the game and speeding up the over rate with spin from both ends. Some lovely touch from Mithali from the third ball races away past third for four. It\u2019s a good over from Gardner aside from that, with no other scoring opportunities apart from the boundaries.     1.54am    13th over: India 63-2 (Yastika Bhatia 21, Mithali Raj 7) Jonassen returns for her second and Mithali pulls her nicely for a single from the second ball to get the more prolific Bhatia on strike. Perry\u2019s over took nine minutes to bowl, so it\u2019s lucky they\u2019ve got spin from the other end to get it through a bit more speedily. This is a much tidier over, only the three from it.     1.51am    12th over: India 60-2 (Yastika Bhatia 20, Mithali Raj 5) Ellyse Perry comes into the attack for the first time today. She has been in great form with the ball lately, can she continue today? She doesn\u2019t get her line quite right from the first ball, but it doesn\u2019t cost her as Bhatia can\u2019t get bat on it. Her second ball is a wide and then Bhatia puts one away very fine for four. Her next ball is another wide and this is really bringing back memories of the India series last year when she couldn\u2019t seem to control her line. She drags it back in next ball and only gives away a single. But then another wide follows - it will be interesting to see if Lanning gives her another over after this or gives her a break to get her head back into it. A dot and a single show she\u2019s got her line in better shape and she finishes the over by coming around the wicket and giving away five wides, so she\u2019ll have to bowl it again. Lanning has a little word to her before she bowls it, but it\u2019s yet another wide. Her radar just isn\u2019t there right now. And there is another wide - she decides to come back over the wicket and finally she finishes the over.     1.43am    11th over: India 44-2 (Yastika Bhatia 15, Mithali Raj 4) We get our first look at some spin for today, with Jess Jonassen coming into the attack after the power play has ended. Bhatia glances it nicely to fine leg for two from Jonassen\u2019s first ball and backs it up with a single. Mithali plays it patiently, but isn\u2019t as cautious as she was with Brown and only lets one dot ball accumulate before she takes a quick single. Bhatia is tempted into a big shot from the last ball of the over and top edges the ball in Perry\u2019s direction, but it falls just short and she\u2019s safe.     1.39am    10th over: India 39-2 (Yastika Bhatia 11, Mithali Raj 3) An edge from Bhatia starts the over, but it falls safely wide of Lanning in slip to give Bhatia a single. Mithali continues in her unhurried manner, not wanting to be lured in by Brown to send a catch to the fielders as her two openers were. It\u2019s a very tidy over from Brown, just the one from it.     1.35am    9th over: India 38-2 (Yastika Bhatia 10, Mithali Raj 3) A fifth over straight for Schutt, Lanning is clearly happy with what she\u2019s getting from her opening bowlers. Bhatia again starts with two really nice looking shots, but they can\u2019t penetrate the field. On the third ball she times one perfectly with her cut shot and gets the ball down to one of those weird pockets of the field and across the boundary for four. Schutt fights back with two dot balls and Bhatia hurries through for a single on the last to retain the strike.     1.32am    8th over: India 33-2 (Yastika Bhatia 5, Mithali Raj 3) Brown comes on for her fourth over, bowling to Mithali, who is 20 years her senior. Brown was born four years after Mithali made her ODI debut, so this is quite a match up. Brown gives away another wide on the fourth ball of the over and Mithali sees her opportunity after that with a beautiful shot through covers for two. Brown finishes the over with two very good balls.     1.28am    7th over: India 30-2 (Yastika Bhatia 5, Mithali Raj 1) Mithali Raj hasn\u2019t been in top form with her batting, so it will be interesting to see what she can do today. Bhatia gets her on strike after three balls and Mithali doesn\u2019t look in too much of a hurry, just taking a single from the final ball of the over.     1.26am    6th over: India 28-2 (Yastika Bhatia 4, Mithali Raj 0) Another over for Brown and Bhatia plays some very nice looking shots to start, but she can\u2019t quite get them past the field. On the third ball of the over, she finally finds a gap, but doesn\u2019t quite time it perfectly and it\u2019s just a single. Brown looks to intimidate Verma with a short ball immediately when she comes on strike after Verma finished the previous over so dominantly. It pays off when she takes Verma\u2019s wicket on the final ball of the over     1.26am   WICKET! Shafali Verma 12 c Mooney b Brown, India 28-2  Once again, just as a batter was getting into their stride, they play a loose shot and exit early. Verma was looking destructive, but Brown bowled perfectly to her, forcing Verma into a late cut outside off that goes to Mooney for an excellent catch at gully.     1.21am    5th over: India 27-1 (Yastika Bhatia 3, Shafali Verma 12) Schutt back for her third over and she starts with a good, tight line. Verma takes a single from the second ball to get Bhatia back on strike and she immediately guides one through the field for another single. Verma gets sick of the singles and brings out a powerful shot back over Schutt\u2019s head for six and is looking much more like the Verma we know and love. Off the next ball she steers the ball through a gap in the field, timed perfectly to get it to the boundary for four. She\u2019s really coming into her own now.  Updated at 1.26am GMT    1.16am    4th over: India 15-1 (Yastika Bhatia 2, Shafali Verma 1) Brown looks to make up for her ordinary first over and she does immediately, with the big wicket of Mandhana, bringing Yastika Bhatia to the crease. Bhatia uses the first ball to get her eye in, before a well run two off the next ball to get off the mark quickly. Brown gives away the first extra of the match with a wide, followed by a dot ball and then another wide. This has shades of Australia\u2019s series against India late last year when they just couldn\u2019t stop bowling wides. Hopefully Brown has got that out of her system now.   Updated at 1.27am GMT    1.13am   WICKET! Smriti Mandhana 10 c Lanning b Brown, India 11-1  Well that\u2019s not what India want to see - Mandhana looked the much better of the two openers and they will have been depending on a big score from her. Brown sends down a length ball that sits just outside off stump and Mandhana edges it to second slip.     1.11am    3rd over: India 11-0 (Smriti Mandhana 10, Shafali Verma 1) Schutt returns and starts with a good length ball that Mandhana can\u2019t quite get away, but she picks up a single from the second ball. Eden Park is a very interesting shaped field and the batters seem to be struggling to decide when they can take two runs - they may settle a bit throughout the game as they get a feel for it. Verma sees out four dots from Schutt - she hasn\u2019t quite got into her groove yet and she\u2019s remaining cautious while she finds her way.     1.07am    2nd over: India 10-0 (Smriti Mandhana 9, Shafali Verma 1) Darcie Brown gets us started from the southern end after taking a break last game, so she should be rested and and refreshed. Mandhana picks up a run immediately off the hip, but the field cuts it off well to stop her taking more runs. Verma gets off the mark next ball with a little inside edge that is fielded by Perry at deep square leg. Mandhana then snaffles the first boundary of the match, with a lovely back foot glance past fine leg.      1.03am    1st over: India 3-0 (Smriti Mandhana 3, Shafali Verma 0) Schutt takes the new ball for Australia, a familiar role for her - although Lanning did mix it up and bring her in later in the innings a couple of matches ago. Mandhana goes immediately on the attack, guiding the first ball past the fielders and picking up a quick two to get off the mark. Schutt draws it back with two dot balls to follow and Mandhana then picks up a single on the drive to give Verma her first look at Schutt for the match. Verma can\u2019t get off the mark and Schutt takes two more dots to finish the over.     12.46am    One change to each of the teams for this game, with Darcie Brown in for Australia and Shafali Verma returning for India after sitting out their last few matches. Australia will of course be looking to erase the memories of the 2017 World Cup, when Harmanpreet Kaur scored 171 in the semi-final against Australia to propel India to victory and send Australia to a shock early exit from the tournament. As much as the team claim this game doesn\u2019t play on their minds and they are a new team now, it\u2019s likely still sitting in the backs of the minds of the senior players and coaching staff who were involved with that game.      12.37am   India XI  Smriti Mandhana Shafali Verma Yastika Bhatia Mithali Raj (c) Harmanpreet Kaur Richa Ghosh (wk) Sneh Rana Pooja Vastrakar Jhulan Goswami Meghna Singh Rajeshwari Gayakwad      12.36am   Australia XI   Alyssa Healy (wk) Rachael Haynes Meg Lanning (c) Ellyse Perry Beth Mooney Tahlia McGrath Ashleigh Gardner Jessica Jonassen Alana King Megan Schutt Darcie Brown      12.34am   Australia won the toss and elected to bowl  What a surprise, Meg Lanning won the toss and decided to chase! Who would have ever seen this coming? Lanning sees India as dangerous for them, with plenty of world class batters, so they are hoping to get off to a good start with the ball. Meanwhile Mithali Raj has been working on building her team\u2019s confidence, knowing they are capable of beating anyone on their day.     12.28am   Preamble  Well here we are once again and what an excellent World Cup it\u2019s been so far! Australia have been dominant, but there have been some incredibly tight and exciting matches among the other teams. No doubt there will have been plenty of eyes on Australia from the other teams as they form plans to bring down the Goliath of the tournament. Can India be the team to finally be their undoing? So far they have been incredibly inconsistent - in some games looking like they had the ability to take out the entire tournament, while in others they\u2019ve appeared unlikely to even make the semi-finals. Which India will turn up today? They put in some very solid ODI performances against Australia late last year, so they will be hoping to channel some of that today. I\u2019m hoping we\u2019re in for an enthralling battle today, so let\u2019s see how it plays out. The toss is due soon and I\u2019ll bring you all the details as soon as we have them.  "

                    "body": "Ryan Reynolds is no stranger to a dramatic finale, but this will have been one the Wrexham co-owner would have rather not seen. The sequel does not always live up to the hype of the original but after their thrilling 3-3 draw in north Wales nine days earlier, that was anything but the case here on a gripping night at Bramall Lane. In the end though Reynolds, Phil Parkinson and everyone associated with Wrexham may well be wondering what might have been.\nMake no mistake about it, over the course of 90 engrossing minutes Sheffield United were worthy winners. Wrexham\u2019s attention must turn back to promotion from the National League as the Blades prepare for Tottenham in the fifth round of the FA Cup. But as we are beginning to learn with Wrexham since their Hollywood-inspired takeover, nothing is ever really that straightforward.\nHaving bombarded Wrexham for nearly 50 minutes, when Anel Ahmedhodzic finally broke the deadlock and put the Blades into a deserved lead, you wondered if Wrexham\u2019s spirit would break. Not a chance. They battled, fought and with 20 minutes left, levelled when Paul Mullin powered home a penalty to bring the non-league side level and send the 4,000-plus travelling supporters into delirium.\n\nBut the drama was just beginning. Seven minutes later, Mullin had a second chance to convert from the spot after being fouled again in the box. This time though, he was denied by Adam Davies \u2013 and that moment not only proved costly on the night, but it will likely haunt Mullin and Wrexham for some time. Just as the game seemed destined for extra time and the fairytale to remain alive for at least another 30 minutes, the Championship side struck twice in ruthless fashion.\nThey probably should have ended the tie before then. But when Billy Sharp converted in stoppage time to make it 2-1, Wrexham had no choice but to chance their arm. That left them open and three minutes later, Sander Berge finished another break to put the result, finally, beyond doubt.\n\u201cI\u2019m immensely proud of the performance,\u201d Parkinson said. \u201cWe\u2019ve taken a very good team right to the wire, and if that penalty had gone in we\u2019d have gone on and won the game. Everyone thought our best chance of winning the tie had gone but I can\u2019t fault how the lads performed.\u201d\n\nThe final scoreline was perhaps harsh on Wrexham given how they acquitted themselves but if you strip back all the glamour, the quality of the Championship side meant the result was the right one, even with Mullin\u2019s penalty miss. For almost the entire first half the Blades laid siege to Wrexham\u2019s penalty area, but were unable to create any clear opportunities in the opening half hour.\nThe pick of the moments came when James McAtee and Iliman Ndiaye broke downfield after the Senegal striker picked off an undercooked pass from Andy Cannon. McAtee should have squared to Ndiaye, but he opted to shoot \u2013 and he curled the ball around Rob Lainton\u2019s post. But shortly after half-time the deadlock was broken, as Ahmedhodzic shot past Lainton after being freed by Ben Osborn.\nAs the game approached the final quarter, Wrexham responded. Mullin was fouled by Ahmedhodzic and he made no mistake from the spot. Crucially though, he would waste his next opportunity seven minutes later. This time Davies denied him with an impressive save \u2013 and it shifted the momentum back the Blades\u2019 way.\n\nThey attacked Wrexham once again. But just as extra time was looming the Blades showed their class and quality, and there was a collective sigh of relief inside the ground when Sharp steered the ball past Lainton to make it 2-1. Then, with Wrexham stretched and pushing for another equaliser, Berge was freed by McAtee and he made no mistake.\n\u201cThe performance was good, we were good from start to finish,\u201d Paul Heckingbottom, United\u2019s manager, rightly pointed out. \u201cWe topped off what\u2019s been a really good Cup tie with the result.\u201d It certainly was a great tie and despite all the fanfare surrounding Wrexham and how close they came to winning the original tie, this time there could be no arguing the outcome was the right one."

                    "body": "Fikayo Tomori had been warned. As Milan chased their first Serie A title since 2011, the one player in the squad who had been a part of it back then spoke up. It was Zlatan Ibrahimovic. \u201cHe was like: \u2018Guys, if we win, be ready because it will go crazy,\u2019\u201d Tomori says. Even so, it is doubtful whether anything could have prepared Tomori and his teammates for the reaction to what they achieved on the Sunday before last, getting the result they needed at Sassuolo to deliver Milan\u2019s 19th Scudetto. And certainly not for the scenes during the open-top bus parade the following night.  The reports vary but some claimed there were as many as one million fans out in celebration, slowing the bus to a crawl as it navigated its way to Piazza del Duomo from Casa Milan, the club\u2019s HQ. Red flares burned; the outpouring of emotion was extraordinary. \u201cIt was like nothing I\u2019ve ever seen before \u2013 so many people,\u201d Tomori says. \u201cIt was a three-, four-, five-kilometre drag but it took hours. To see everyone on the streets \u2026 I can\u2019t really describe it.\u201d Few thought Milan would be able to hold off their city rivals, Internazionale \u2013 not with such a young, unstarry squad (Ibrahimovic aside) and definitely not with the inexperienced back four the manager, Stefano Pioli, came to rely upon. Tomori, 24, was partnered in the centre by Pierre Kalulu, 21. The full-backs were Davide Calabria, 25, and Theo Hern\u00e1ndez, 24. You win nothing with kids and not at Milan, where the shirt is so heavy. But they would finish with the division\u2019s joint-best defensive record. During the run-in they conceded twice in 11 matches. \u201cNo one expected us to do it,\u201d Tomori says. \u201cSo when we did, it felt even better \u2013 kind of proving people wrong, it was sweet for all of us. We knew we could do it.\u201d What a season it has been for Tomori after his \u00a325m move from Chelsea; he had been on loan at Milan for the second half of the previous campaign. He is one of the first names on Pioli\u2019s teamsheet, his pace helping to facilitate a high line; his aggression and anticipation standing out as his concentration and tactical awareness have improved.  The cherry on top? His England recall for the Nations League fixtures, the first of which is against Hungary in Budapest on Saturday. The third of the four is against Italy at Molineux next Saturday. Tomori was previously selected by Gareth Southgate last October, when he won his second cap as a substitute in the 5-0 away win over Andorra. His debut had come in November 2019 as a substitute in the 4-0 victory in Kosovo. There was surprise in some quarters when Tomori was overlooked for the March programme but his timing feels in, with this the penultimate get-together before the World Cup kicks off in Qatar on 21 November. He is essentially a replacement for Tyrone Mings and his competition for the final squad is likely to come from Conor Coady, Marc Gu\u00e9hi and Ben White. \u201cIf I don\u2019t get called up, I\u2019m not thinking: \u2018Ah, what\u2019s happening?\u2019\u201d Tomori says. \u201cI wasn\u2019t panicking [in March], I was just focusing on my performances and helping Milan. But from there, if I do get called up, it\u2019s making sure I take the steps to stay here.\u201d Tomori loves the Italian view of defending as an art form and he is enjoying Pioli\u2019s attention to detail, as well as the occasional chat with Paolo Maldini, the Milan technical director. \u201cI saw [Franco] Baresi after the last game, which was cool,\u201d Tomori says. \u201cYou see different legends just flying about. \u201cThe way they are as defenders [in Italy] \u2013 I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s personal but it\u2019s: \u2018I need to make sure what I\u2019m doing is on the money and no one\u2019s getting past me.\u2019 They have that pride. There are little things the manager will tell me \u2013 make sure that you are blocking a run or that you are not allowing this to happen or making contact in the box. \u201cWatching [Leonardo] Bonucci and [Giorgio] Chiellini \u2026 they are very streetwise, you pick up stuff. The referees whistle a lot more so you can\u2019t go in or, if you do, you have to tackle properly. You make sure you stay on your feet and are in the right positions so you can win the ball back and not give away fouls.\u201d Tomori\u2019s mind goes back to a different scene of celebration outside the Duomo from the summer of last year, albeit one he could not embrace. He had followed England\u2019s Euro 2020 ties in London, taking in the quarter-final win over Ukraine from Boxpark Shoreditch. But he was back in Milan for the final, watching in a hotel as England lost on penalties to Italy after a 1-1 draw.  \u201cWhen they equalised, I had a face on and didn\u2019t want to look too down,\u201d Tomori says. \u201cBut as the penalties were going on, it was difficult to watch. I was near the Duomo and, in a way, it was nice to see them celebrating. I was right in the middle of it. \u201cBut really I couldn\u2019t get out of there fast enough. I\u2019d felt how it was in England as we advanced; it was madness. Then I saw Italy celebrate after the final and it\u2019s definitely a motivation for me.\u201d Italy will not be going to the World Cup after their playoff loss to North Macedonia in March. Tomori\u2019s command of Italian is impressive and he explains that \u201cMacedonia\u201d translates in his new language as \u201cfruit salad\u201d, which led to a typically close-to-the-bone situation in the dressing room involving his Milan teammates Sandro Tonali and Alessandro Florenzi, who were both part of the defeated Italian squad.  \u201cTonali and Florenzi were there so people brought the Macedonia [fruit salad] to the training ground,\u201d Tomori says. \u201cThe newspapers were like: \u2018Whoa.\u2019 But the people were saying: \u2018Well, we lost to a fruit salad.\u2019 \u201cIt was taken as a joke but it was a weird one. They just didn\u2019t expect to lose.\u201d"

Leeds were heading for a sixth successive third-round exit until the 18-year-old substitute Sonny Perkins scored his first professional goal to equalise deep into second-half stoppage time and earn a replay. Leeds have won only two of their past 16 matches in all competitions and Marsch said they must heed the lessons of their late rally after conceding they were initially out of sync in south Wales. \u201cAs a manager I\u2019ve never lost to a lower-division team in the cup and part of it is because I demand that the players take it seriously and we play with intensity as if it\u2019s a first-division match,\u201d the head coach said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t do that in the first half and we put ourselves in jeopardy. We have to learn now \u2013 it is a young group \u2013 what cup matches are and how to handle them. Part of the challenge is also trying to teach our team to be bigger winners and understand how to handle things and how to manage moments. I think we can use this as a stepping stone for us to move forward.\u201d  Leeds trailed 2-0 at half-time after goals by Jaden Philogene-Bidace and Sheyi Ojo. Marsch praised the impact of his bench with Rodrigo, part of a triple substitution on the hour, particularly influential. Cody Drameh and Max Wober also arrived, the latter for his debut following a \u00a310m move from Red Bull Salzburg. Rodrigo headed in within five minutes of entering the field but missed an 81st-minute penalty after the Cardiff left-back Joel Bagan was sent off for handball. \u201cThe whole first half it is hard to pinpoint one thing; it was not in sync, it was not aggressive enough and there was not a full understanding of what exactly this game and this tournament was going to require,\u201d Marsch said. \u201cI think the subs came in and helped make a difference.\u201d The winners of the replay at Elland Road, to be played on either 17 or 18 January, will face a trip to the winners of Accrington Stanley versus Boreham Wood. \u201cI\u2019m disappointed for the players because of the amount of work they\u2019ve put in and we\u2019ve shown that on our day that we can take it to a Premier League team,\u201d said the Cardiff manager, Mark Hudson. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to play like that again next week.\u201d"

                    "body": "Australia\u2019s love affair with the Melbourne Cup appears to be waning, with a new survey finding more than half have \u201clow\u201d or \u201cno interest\u201d in the race that traditionally stops the nation. Amid growing support for the Nup to the Cup movement, the latest Guardian Essential poll also suggests almost half of those surveyed (45%) believe it promotes \u201cunhealthy\u201d gambling behaviour, with a third (34%) saying it normalises animal cruelty. Ahead of Tuesday\u2019s cup day at Flemington, the poll finds about three-quarters of people (72%) believe the Melbourne Cup is a \u201cunique part of Australia\u2019s national identity\u201d, which is down six percentage points since 2019, despite being up from 67% when the question was asked last year.  Men are more likely to agree with the sentiment compared to women (73% to 71%), but the most marked difference comes from a breakdown of age groups. Only 56% of those aged 18 to 34 view the Melbourne Cup in such a light, compared to 86% of those over the age of 55 and 72% of those aged 35-54. Overall, 15% say they have a high interest in Tuesday\u2019s race, with 31% showing moderate interest, 24% low interest and 28% no interest. The findings come amid falling attendance numbers for the race \u2013 even before the past two years of Covid restrictions \u2013 and a backlash to horse fatalities that prompted a review by Racing Victoria.  Sign up for our free morning and afternoon email newsletters from Guardian Australia for your daily news roundup  But despite the dwindling allure of the Cup, the survey shows that a growing number of people still intend to place a bet, including those who do not consider themselves regular gamblers. Of the 1,038 people surveyed, 47% of people intend to place a bet on Tuesday\u2019s race, including 56% of males and 39% of females, up from 36% last year and 42% in 2020. Overall, 18% of those intending to gamble say they bet regularly on horse races and will place a bet this time. This is up 3% compared to a year ago. Almost a third of people (29%) say they \u201crarely\u201d bet on horse races, but intend to gamble on the Cup, an 8% increase since last year. Women are more likely to be occasional than regular gamblers, with most women (61%) not intending to bet on the race. Middle aged men are the most likely to gamble, with 56% of men saying they will bet on the race \u2013 25% of those say they regularly bet on horse races.  About a third of those polled (34%) say they will not watch the race and will not place a bet, with women and those over the age of 55 the least likely to tune in and gamble at 40% and 41% respectively. And despite young people being more likely than those over the age of 55 to link the cup with unhealthy gambling behaviour and animal cruelty (39% compared to 24%), they are also more likely to gamble than older people. Half of those aged 18 to 34 say they intend to bet on the race, compared to 56% of those aged 35 to 54 and 36% of those over the age of 55. Green and independent voters are most likely to be concerned by gambling and animal cruelty linked to the cup, while almost half of all Labor voters (47%) believe it promotes unhealthy gambling compared to 37% of Coalition voters. The gap is narrower when it comes to animal cruelty concerns, with just 34% of Labor voters and 30% of Coalition voters saying it is an issue."

                    "body": "It was a bad day at the office for Northern Ireland manager, Kenny Shiels. Discussing his team\u2019s 5-0 defeat to England on Tuesday, a loss that ended their hopes for the 2023 Women\u2019s World Cup, he explained that \u201cgirls and women are more emotional than men, so they take a goal and then they don\u2019t take that very well\u201d. It wasn\u2019t a slip of the tongue. He went on to explain his theory, using statistics about how often a second goal is conceded quickly after the first. \u201cThat\u2019s an emotional goal,\u201d he suggested. After a minute or so of chat about the subject, there was a telltale pause. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have told you that,\u201d he said. Perhaps the emotion of the occasion got the better of him. It wouldn\u2019t be the first time Shiels had put his foot in it and he proved to have impeccable analytical skills regarding his own post-match press conference, at least, because he really shouldn\u2019t have told us that. His remarks quickly drew condemnation and it was hard to know which eyeroll should come first. Was it for the casual sexism, the stereotypes, for a man becoming the centre of attention during a big night for women, or for the implication that emotions in sport are inherently negative, a view that damages both men and women? And you do have to wonder when Shiels last watched men play any sport. There\u2019s more drama in a Sunday league match than in the Christmas episode of EastEnders. \u201cKenny Shiels talking foolishness,\u201d said Ian Wright, posting pictures of himself in tears on the pitch. This was the same week that the two-part documentary Gazza began on BBC2, a story stuffed with players\u2019 emotions and emotional havoc, in the same week that Ronaldo hit a phone out of a 14-year-old\u2019s hand after Manchester United lost to Everton. Still, women, eh? With their special lady emotions, getting all lady-upset about the goals! By the end of the week, Shiels emerged from the furore a little bruised, but after a sincere-sounding apology, his job was intact and he had the support of his team. I found the whole fiasco quite heartening in the end, which is weird, because I probably should have had a meltdown and cried about it. What stood out most is that 10 years ago, comments like this probably wouldn\u2019t have caused much of a fuss. Instead, the near-unified reaction to it offered a clear indication of where the women\u2019s game is going and what it is leaving behind. Liz Carr: maskless crowds add to Covid stage fright  Backstage at the Olivier awards last Sunday, Liz Carr, who had just won best supporting actress for her role in The Normal Heart at the National, told the BBC thatshe had not been to a theatre in over two years. \u201cThis is a frightening night for me,\u201d she said, explaining that, while she had appeared on stage in front of an audience during that time, she was surrounded by a cast and crew who were testing for Covid every day.  Now that face covering rules have been lifted, audiences are no longer legally obliged to wear masks and in my experience of live performances recently, it seems that more choose not to than choose to. That\u2019s the law. But Carr suggested a solution for those who do not feel comfortable, or able, to put their health at the mercy of other people\u2019s choice to wear a mask or not. She suggested special performances, with mandatory mask-wearing and less capacity, so that those with health conditions aren\u2019t excluded from going to the theatre. The Royal Shakespeare Company put on a reduced capacity performance of Much Ado About Nothing last month, asking audience members to wear masks, for this exact reason. It makes absolute sense and should be more widespread. Dan Stevens: watch your chatshow ratings, Boris  On The One Show last Wednesday, the actor Dan Stevens took a run up to his punchline as if he were doing the long jump. Asked about Gaslit, his new series about Richard Nixon, he talked of \u201ca criminal for a leader who is wrapped in a messy war, embroiled in a stupid scandal and surrounded by ambitious idiots and really should resign\u201d.  You could see what was coming, though the presenters seemed shocked when he stuck the landing and revealed he was talking about Boris Johnson instead. They didn\u2019t know where to look or what to say. Obviously, the clip went viral. It was a spiky interlude for the BBC show, which is usually so cosy you could wear it as a dressing gown. I know it was Stevens going rogue, but the government\u2019s rule-breaking is cutting through to the sofas on an early evening chatshow.  On Twitter, the amiable TV host Rylan Clarke-Neal found himself arguing with, and gaining the upper hand over, Edwina Currie, who tried the \u201cmove on\u201d defence, to weaker and weaker effect. This is Matt Lucas spoofing Johnson\u2019s ineptitude on Bake Off. It\u2019s Ant &amp; Dec\u2019s \u201cgood evening, prime minister... for now\u201d on I\u2019m a Celebrity. These are not BBC4 documentaries watched by 700 people on a good night. These are at the heart of mainstream TV.  For all the right-leaning front pages urging the public to move on from partygate \u2013 some people break the law in office, get over it! \u2013 it\u2019s the light entertainment test that may prove telling in the end. \u2022 Rebecca Nicholson is an Observer columnist"

                    "body": "  6.27pm   Afternoon summary  Here\u2019s a quick summary of what\u2019s happened today in business news:   Elon Musk\u2019s fate as Twitter CEO is uncertain after he released a poll asking Twitter users whether he should step down as head of Twitter. Over 57% of 17.5m users who voted said that he should. Though Musk said he would abide by the results of the poll, he has not made any announcements regarding plans to step down.  A union representing Twitter staff in the UK cautioned that even if Musk steps down as CEO, he would still be owner of the company.  UK spring budget will be delivered on 15 March, chancellor Jeremy Hunt announced today.  The US Federal Trade Commission announced a settlement with Epic Games, the maker of popular video game Fortnite, for a total $520m. The agency said the company violated child privacy protection laws.   We\u2019re pausing this blog for now but will return if any news around Musk and Twitter arises. Thank you for reading.      6.02pm    Two California-based employees are accusing Tesla of retaliation after they were fired while participating in a group that was drafting letters critical of Tesla CEO Elon Musk. The employees filed a complaint with the National Labor Relations Board last week, according to Bloomberg.  The letters drafted by the group asked company executives to reconsider Musk\u2019s return-to-office police, saying that they violated Tesla\u2019s anti-harassment policy. Both employees were fired in June \u2013 one was told that their discussions on Tesla were \u201can attack\u201d on the company.     5.41pm    A week after his arrest last Monday, former FTX chief executive Sam Bankman-Fried is appearing in court in the Bahamas, where is being held in custody. While Bankman-Fried had indicated he would fight extradition charges, it seems that he could agree to an extradition, according to CNN. In court on Monday, Bankman-Fried asked to see a copy of his indictment and then was granted a phone call with his US-based attorneys.  Bankman-Fried faces eight charges of conspiracy and fraud for his actions at FTX and private equity firm Alameda Research.  Updated at 5.45pm GMT    5.12pm    The European Union is accusing Meta of violating antitrust rules by \u201cdistorting competition in the markets for online classified ads\u201d, the European Commission said on Monday.  The commission said that it \u201ctakes issue with Meta tying its online classified ads service, Facebook Marketplace, to its personal social network, Facebook,\u201d it said in a statement. It is also accusing Meta of imposing unfair trading conditions to its competitors of Facebook marketplace.  The tie, it says, \u201cgives Facebook Marketplace a substantial distribution advantage that competitors cannot match\u201d.  The commission said its statement of objections to Meta is a \u201cpreliminary view\u201d after it opened an investigation into the company in June 2021 but does not prejudge the outcome of the investigation. It is unclear when the investigation will end as there is no legal deadline for an antitrust investigation.      4.46pm    US senator Elizabeth Warren sent a letter to the chair of Tesla\u2019s board of investors Robyn Denholm Sunday night saying Elon Musk may not be the fully dedicated CEO the company needs.  \u201cAs you know, it is the legal obligation of Tesla\u2019s board to ensure that its CEO is meeting all his legal responsibilities as an effective leader,\u201d Warren wrote, according to the New York Times.  Warren inquired whether Musk sending Tesla employees to work at Twitter \u2013 at least 50 Tesla employees were pulled into Twitter since Musk took over at the end of October \u2013 is harming the company. She also suggested that Musk could be using one company to benefit the other, for example charging Tesla more for ads or readjusting Twitter\u2019s algorithm to benefit Tesla, what could be antitrust violations.  \u201cThe problems identified in this letter are not merely theoretical,\u201d Warren wrote, noting that Tesla\u2019s stock has fallen as Musk conducted over his takeover of Twitter. She said there could be \u201csignificant legal questions\u201d about the relationship between the two companies in the future.       4.22pm    In a tweet on Epic Games settlement with the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC), the company\u2019s CEO Tim Sweeney said the settlements reflect how American regulatory practices are changing.  \u201cDevelopers should dig into the topic, as this settlement reflects state of the art American regulatory practice,\u201d Sweeney said.   While Epic Games is framing the settlement as a change in regulatory practices, the FTC says that the company knew the children were playing without parents\u2019 consent.  \u201cFirms cannot put growth and revenue over the safety and privacy of their users, especially children and teens,\u201d said FTC chair Lina Khan in a series of tweets. The company \u201cput children and teens at risk with privacy invasive default settings\u201d.  \u201cNotably, our complaint states that these default settings caused substantial harm and constituted \u2018unfair\u2019 practices against both kids and teens,\u201d she said.      3.55pm    Epic Games, which the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) just announced agreed to pay $520m in settlements over privacy law violations, released a statement on the settlement saying \u201cno developer creates a game with the intention of ending up here\u201d. \u201cThe video game industry is a place of fast-moving innovation, where player expectations are high and new ideas are paramount,\u201d the statement said. \u201cStatutes written decades ago don\u2019t specify how gaming ecosystems should operate. The laws have not changed, but their application has evolved and long-standing industry practices are no longer enough.\u201d \u201cWe accepted this agreement because we want Epic to be at the forefront of consumer protection and provide the best experience for our players,\u201d the company said.  Updated at 4.22pm GMT    3.31pm    This is Lauren Aratani in New York taking over. Epic Games, the creator of the popular video game Fortnite, is agreeing to pay the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) a total of $520m for two settlements after violating children\u2019s privacy law, the FTC announced this morning.  The agency said the video game maker \u201cdeployed design tricks, known as dark patterns, to dupe millions of players into making unintentional purchases.\u201d The company is agreeing to pay two settlements: $275m for violating the agency\u2019s Children\u2019s Online Privacy Protection Act, which bans companies from disclosing, collecting or using information from children under 13 and $245m as a refund to consumers for \u201cits dark patterns and billing practices\u201d. The FTC said the settlements are the largest monetary penalty for violating the privacy protection act and the largest refund in a gaming case.  \u201cEpic used privacy-invasive default settings and deceptive interfaces that tricked Fortnite users, including teenagers and children,\u201d FTC chair Lina Khan said in a statement. \u201cProtecting the public, and especially children, from online privacy invasions and dark patterns is a top priority for the commission.\u201d  Fortnite gained popularity in 2018, generating Epic Games $9bn in the game\u2019s first two years of existence.       3.11pm    Wall Street has been trading for about half an hour, and Tesla shares have enjoyed a small bump. The carmaker\u2019s value was up by 1.7% at the time of writing at $152.72 \u2013 less than the 4.5% move at one point in pre-open trading.  Of course, that does not make up for the large losses endured by shareholders this year, but with a stock of this size it does mean a $5bn gain \u2013 Musk\u2019s 13% shareholding would equate to about $650m in paper valuation. That would not be a bad return for most Twitter polls.      2.44pm     Former Meta chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg and Nextdoor boss Sarah Friar would make for good candidates to lead Twitter, says the Financial Times\u2019s Lex column. Sandberg announced her resignation from Facebook in June, after transforming it into one of the biggest advertising companies in the world. She was seen as an \u201cadult in the room\u201d beside founder Mark Zuckerberg. Perhaps the same steadying hand could help at Elon Musk\u2019s company. Friar was previously finance boss at Square, the payments company set up by Twitter founder Jack Dorsey, so the FT (\u00a3) reckons she could help with Musk\u2019s aims for Twitter to become a \u201csuperapp\u201d offering payments, among other things. A rare Northern Irish (she\u2019s from County Tyrone, if you\u2019re asking) transplant to California, she also has Goldman Sachs, McKinsey, and the universities of Oxford and Stanford on her CV. There is also a sting in the tail of the FT\u2019s piece: it reckons that Twitter\u2019s valuation is only just over a third of what Musk and his backers actually paid. That is value destruction to rival Tesla during 2022.  Valued at about three times trailing revenue (equal to similar-sized peer Snap), Twitter\u2019s enterprise value would now be just $15bn.      2.06pm    So who is likely to take over from Musk as CEO of Twitter?  TechCrunch editor at large Mike Butcher says it\u2019s likely to be someone quite \u201ccommercially minded\u201d from Silicon Valley that can put Twitter on an \u201ceven keel.\u201d  Butcher says no one thought Musk was going to stay in the job forever, and was likely under pressure from Tesla\u2019s board, who have watched shares plunge following a string of controversies linked to his takeover of Twitter.  He said it\u2019s very likely that Musk will leave, it\u2019s just a matter of when.       1.48pm    Mike Butcher, editor at large at TechCrunch, tells Sky News that it\u2019s very likely that Musk had a plan already in place before he issuing the Twitter poll.   Elon Musk is very mercurial so it\u2019s very hard to tell whether or not he\u2019ll actually abide by the poll, but it\u2019s more likely that he already had a plan ahead of doing that poll.  It\u2019s not quite clear what that plan is exactly, but Butcher notes that Musk issued the Tweet after landing in Qatar for the World Cup final. He says Musk \u201cmost certainly\u201d had talks with investors, given he has backers in the region who helped him take over Twitter in the first place.  One thing you can be sure of its that he\u2019ll do whatever he wants\u2026whether he\u2019s said one thing earlier or not. It\u2019s as simple as that. So we\u2019ll have to wait and see.  In terms of current management teams, Butcher notes that Musk is surrounded by people who \u201cdo his bidding\u201d and that there is no longer a board to really speak of. \u201cSo it\u2019s really down to one man, pretty much all of it\u201d. The staff themselves have had to figure out what Twitter should be doing via his tweets rather than through any internal communications, as might normally happen inside any \u201cnormal company\u201d It\u2019s been a \u201ctotally chaotic period under Musk\u2019s leadership\u201d, Butcher adds.  Updated at 1.56pm GMT    1.00pm   Union cautions Musk still Twitter owner even if he steps down as CEO  A union which represents some of Twitter\u2019s UK staff says that even if Musk does honour the poll and steps down as CEO, the social media firm\u2019s strategy is unlikely to change given he still owns the company.  Furthermore, the way Musk hinged his decision on the outcome of an online poll is yet another sign of the \u201cdeep issues\u201d plaguing the company under his watch, according to the Prospect union\u2019s general secretary Mike Clancy.  Clancy said in a statement:   This latest erratic behaviour by Elon Musk, once again underlines the deep issues over the way this company is being run. Whether or not Musk carries through on this vote, and is the chief executive going forward, he will still own the business. This means it seems highly doubtful that we will see a sea change in strategy. The way that Twitter under Musk has treated its staff has been appalling, riding roughshod over the principles that underpin UK employment law. What is needed is a fundamental change in approach, rather than more attention seeking, knee jerk decision making.   Updated at 4.23pm GMT    12.36pm    In case Musk is on the hunt for a replacement, Snoop Dog had issued his own tongue-in-cheek poll and asking his own followers whether the rapper should replace the Tesla boss as head of Twitter:       12.09pm    More than 10 million people voted in favour of Elon Musk stepping down as chief executive of Twitter in a poll he posted on the site late on Sunday. The billionaire, who bought the company and installed himself as its head just 50 days ago, has insisted there is no successor in the wings. \u201cNo one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive,\u201d he said on the social network. \u201cThere is no successor.\u201d Replying to another user who said they could do the job, Musk added \u201cyou must like pain a lot. One catch: you have to invest your life savings in Twitter and it has been in the fast lane to bankruptcy since May. Still want the job?\u201d Musk has a history of using Twitter polls to rubber-stamp major decisions, selling a tenth of his Tesla holdings after one poll in 2021, restoring Donald Trump\u2019s account after a second last month and reinstating a swath of suspended accounts following a third. \u201cVox Populi, Vox Dei\u201d, Musk tweeted after the Trump poll. You can read the full story \u2013 including details of the chaos surrounding account bans \u2013 here:      12.04pm     If Musk does follow through on his promise to \u201cabide by the results\u201d of the poll there is one group of people who would almost certainly be pleased: investors in Tesla. Musk\u2019s focus on the social network has come at a time when Tesla shares have been under enormous and sustained pressure. That has not been aided by Musk\u2019s need to sell Tesla shares worth billions to fund the Twitter deal. Tesla shares have gained 4.5% in pre-market trading on Monday to above $157 \u2013 up from just over $150 at Friday\u2019s close, according to data from Google. The value of the company had fallen by 50% to $470bn (\u00a3387bn) over the course of 2022. That is still enormous, but less than the $1 trillion valuation it achieved in October 2021. Rival carmakers are catching up with electric vehicles and there has also been a broader rout in tech shares as rising interest rates diminished the relative value of future earnings. The US stock market benchmark, the S&amp;P 500, fell by 16% over the same time period. Dan Ives, a tech analyst at Wedbush Securities, a US investment bank, said if Musk hands the reins of Twitter over it would be a \u201cmajor positive\u201d and allow Musk to stop the damage on Tesla. Ives has a price target of $250 for Tesla shares. \u201cTime to end this nightmare as CEO of Twitter,\u201d he said in a note sent to clients on Monday.  From the botched verification subscription plan to banning journalists to political firestorms caused on a daily basis [it has] been the perfect storm as advertisers have run for the hills and left Twitter squarely in the red ink potentially on track to lose roughly $4bn per year we estimate. More red ink means funding gaps causing Musk to sell more Tesla stock which has been used as his own personal ATM machine since this saga began in April. As such, this has been a black eye moment for Musk and been a major overhang on Tesla\u2019s stock which continues to suffer in a brutal way since the Twitter soap opera began with brand deterioration related to Musk a real issue. Musk is Tesla and Tesla is Musk. Attention focused on Twitter instead of golden child Tesla has been another big issue for investors and likely is behind this poll results with many Musk loyalists wanting him to leave as CEO of Twitter. With the poll closing this morning, it appears Musk\u2019s reign as CEO of Twitter will come to end and thus be a major positive for Tesla\u2019s stock starting to slowly remove this albatross from the story.      11.38am    All eyes will now be on Elon Musk\u2019s own Twitter account to hear what his next steps might be.  However, it is unclear when he will comment \u2013 not least because he may still be in the air. Musk\u2019s private jet took off from Doha about three hours ago, where he was watching the final of the football World Cup. *There is of course an irony in reporting on the movements of his jet: the source for these data is an automated social media account on Instagram called Elon Musk\u2019s Jet. Musk himself banned the Twitter version of the account, and several journalists covering his actions, after accusing them of \u201cdoxxing\u201d him by posting details of his whereabouts. He then reversed some of the bans a few days later.     11.21am   Twitter poll says Elon Musk should step down as chief executive  Confirmation: Elon Musk\u2019s Twitter poll says he should step down as chief executive of the social media company. There were 17,502,391 votes. 57.5% were in favour. 42.5% were against.  *This post has been updated. The total vote figure rose by about 200,000 following the closure of the poll.  Updated at 11.43am GMT    11.17am    With only about three minutes left, it looks very likely that Elon Musk\u2019s Twitter poll will say he should step down as chief executive. Twitter polls are hardly binding votes, but Musk does have a history of following through on them. It is unclear what Musk\u2019s plan is, given the lack of an obvious successor.  Musk himself spent Sunday in Qatar watching Argentina win the football world cup. Pictures from the stadium showed him standing beside Jared Kushner, the son-in-law of Donald Trump.  Trump, of course, used Twitter to his advantage during his US presidential run, and then started a rival social media company, Truth Social. Twitter briefly banned users from posting links to rival social media companies, including Truth Social and larger rivals such as Instagram and Facebook.     10.56am   Bank of England launches consultation on scrapping banker bonus cap  And as chancellor Jeremy Hunt prepares for a range of City reforms in a bit to spur growth, the Bank of England has launched the first of a raft of consultations: this time on the banker bonus cap. Plans to scrap the EU cap were first announced during the September mini-budget, paving the way for bankers to earn more than 200% of their salaries in bonuses.  However, recruiters and bankers are sceptical that it will spark much change here in the UK \u2013 where bankers have grown accustomed to higher fixed pay, which by and large rose to compensate for the bonus cap which came into force in 2014:  However, the Bank of England said as part of the consultation:   The proposed changes should\u2026help remove unintended consequences that have arisen as a result of the bonus cap, namely growth in the proportion of the fixed component of total remuneration, which reduces firms\u2019 ability to adjust costs to absorb losses in a downturn.       10.30am   Poll update: 57.6% so far vote for Musk to step down as Twitter boss  The proportion of Twitter users voting for Musk to resign as head of Twitter is climbing with 50 minutes left to go: Yes: 57.6% No: 42.4%     10.05am    In a written statement regarding the UK spring budget, chancellor Jeremy Hunt has said:  Today I can inform the House that I have asked the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) to prepare a forecast for 15March 2023 to accompany a spring budget. This forecast, in addition to the forecast that took place in November 2022, will fulfil the obligation for the OBR to produce at least two forecasts in a financial year, as is required by legislation.   Updated at 10.14am GMT    10.01am   BREAKING: UK spring budget to be held 15 March 2023  The chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, will deliver the spring budget on 15 March 2023, according to Reuters. And for the avoidance of any doubt (given the controversy that followed the lack of forecasts alongside the disastrous mini-budget delivered by ex-PM Liz Truss and her chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng) the Office for Budget Responsibility has been commissioned to prepare forecasts alongside the presentation, Reuters adds.  Updated at 10.15am GMT    9.51am    Call it Chekhov\u2019s Jet: a Twitter account placed on the mantelpiece in act one must surely go off in act five. Seven days after buying the social network he tweeted that his commitment to free speech extended even \u201cto not banning the account following my plane\u201d. Six weeks later, his reversal of that policy set in motion a series of events that seems increasingly likely to end in his dramatic departure as chief executive of Twitter. On Thursday, Musk banned the @ElonJet account, claiming to be spooked by an apparently unrelated altercation with a man who was stalking his ex-wife. On Friday, he suspended the accounts of a number of journalists who had reported on his move.  On Saturday, he suspended the account of Taylor Lorenz, a reporter at The Washington Post who had sent him a request for comment on the site, later claiming it was for \u201chistorical doxing offences\u201d: breaking a rule that hadn\u2019t existed when she broke it, with tweets that were no longer live on the site. On Sunday, he reinstated her account, before immediately banning her permanently, for breaking another newly created rule: a ban on any promotion of accounts on other social networks, a policy apparently instated in a hurry over the weekend in an attempt to stem the flow of users leaving the social network for sites not run at the whim of a vengeful billionaire. Like the old woman who swallowed the fly, each time Musk reacts to the problems he\u2019s caused, he creates bigger and bigger problems for himself. If his offer to step down is to be taken at face value, it would represent a rare moment of insight in his 50 days at the top of Twitter: the realisation that the only common cause of all of Musk\u2019s problems on social media are Musk himself.  Updated at 10.10am GMT    9.27am   Tesla shares rise as clock ticks on Musk's Twitter resignation poll  Telsa investors seem to pleased with the way that Musk\u2019s Twitter poll is leaning towards his potential resignation, with shares up 4% in pre-market trading:      9.17am    Economic data interlude:  The German Ifo business climate data for December shows confidence among the country\u2019s firms rose more than expected, despite the energy crisis and high inflation.  The index rose from 86.4 in November to 88.6 this month.  A Reuters poll of analysts had suggested the reading would be closer to 87.4.       9.12am   Musk poll: 57.4% so far voting in favour of his resignation as Twitter boss  A quick update on Musk\u2019s Twitter resignation poll, which has now attracted 15.8 million votes with just two hours left to go: Yes: 57.4% No: 42.6%  Updated at 9.32am GMT    9.00am    Victoria Scholar, head of investment at interactive investor, says Musk\u2019s Twitter controversies are compounding other issues for Tesla, which is already grappling with supply shortages and increased competition. Scholar explains:  The electric carmaker has been one of the worst performers in US tech this year, down by more than 60% following a meteoric surge for the stock of more than 1600% from the 2020 trough to the peak in 2021. Tesla has had the added pressure this year from Elon Musk\u2019s Twitter acquisition which has distracted the billionaire, taking his attention away from the EV giant. Even prior to the Twitter deal, Musk was already spreading himself very thinly with SpaceX, Neuralink, the Boring Company as well as Tesla.  It\u2019s also worth remembering that Musk used his Tesla shares to help fund his $44bn takeover of Twitter, which has also caused concern among investors.  Musk has been using Tesla stock to fund his Twitter deal by selling a total of $22.9bn worth of Tesla stock this year in another sign he is taking his eye off the ball and weighing on investor confidence. Tesla has had a series of headwinds to grapple with from growing competition in the EV space, the global chip shortage, problems with the global supply chain and the shift in investor preferences away from technology. Investors remain cautious towards technology in 2023 and Musk\u2019s Twitter distraction certainly doesn\u2019t help.   Updated at 9.00am GMT    8.39am   Tesla shares fall further in after-hours trading as Musk mulls future at Twitter  Shares in Tesla, the electric car company that is responsible for making Elon Musk one of the richest men in the world, continue to suffer in after-hours trading. The stock price is down a further 0.77%, adding to further pain for shareholders. Tesla shares having plunged more than 62% so far this year \u2013 a fall that is partly linked to the continued controversies related to Musk\u2019s forays into social media ownership.   Updated at 9.47am GMT    8.27am    A quick check in on European equity markets, where major indices are trading higher at the start of trading:   FTSE 100 is up 0.36%  FTSE 250 is up 0.2% Germany\u2019s Xetra Dax is up 0.68% France\u2019s Cac 40 is up 0.7%  Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB is up 0.6%      8.11am   Analyst: Twitter has been a \"black eye\" for Tesla  Dan Ives, a managing director of equity research at US investment firm Wedbush Securities, says Musk\u2019s willingness to step back may be linked to the fact that controversies linked to Twitter have started to damage his \u201cgolden child\u201d: Tesla.  Ives told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme this morning that while Musk has not necessarily followed through with the decisive calls of Twitter polls in the past, this time is different:  The last few weeks, few months, [have] been a black eye for Musk and a black eye for Tesla, and I think ultimately that\u2019s the golden child: that 90% plus of his wealth. And that\u2019s why I think the writings on the wall, and I think ultimately in the next 24 hours, Musk will probably name a temporary CEO of Twitter.  Ives said it\u2019s clear that Musk needs to stick to his strengths:  He can build rockets and create electric cars. That\u2019s why he is who he is. But when it comes to social media and to Twitter, I think this is a diff type of animal, and he\u2019s realised he can\u2019t balance this as well as Tesla and Space X. And I think the writing\u2019s on the wall that he cannot be CEO of Twitter.  And as for how quickly we could see changes enacted, Ives reckons the executive overhaul could be triggered within hours.  I think the pressure was building, I think ultimately, probably in the next 5-6 hours, it\u2019s going to be the end of Musk reigning as CEO of Twitter.   Updated at 9.47am GMT    7.52am    Full story: Musk sets up Twitter poll asking if he should step down as head Elon Musk has asked Twitter users whether he should step down as the head of the company, promising to abide by the results of his poll. Musk assumed the role of CEO at the end of October after firing a host of senior executives and dissolving its board of directors. Within minutes of posting the poll, more than 1 million people had voted. After 20 minutes of polling, when the yes vote gained a double-digit lead, Musk responded to a suggestion that he had already picked a new CEO, saying: \u201cNo one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor.\u201d   Updated at 9.48am GMT    7.44am   Introduction: Elon Musk pledges to honour poll over his potential resignation as Twitter CEO  Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the economy, business and the financial markets. Less than two months after Elon Musk controversially bought Twitter for $44m and installed himself as CEO of the company, he is putting his fate in the hands of its users. Following a string of controversies over layoffs, new posting policies and temporary journalist bans, the billionaire issued a Twitter poll in the early hours of Monday morning, asking users \u201cShould I step down as head of Twitter? I will abide by the results of this poll\u201d  As of the time of writing, the poll had already attracted more than 14 million votes, with around 57% voting for his resignation. The poll is set to close around 11am GMT, though it is not clear how quickly Musk would step down if the majority of voters call for his ousting. It is also unclear who would replace Musk as chief executive. He said in a separate tweet, Musk said: \u201cNo one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor.\u201d  Meanwhile, it\u2019s relatively quiet on the economics front in the lead up to the Christmas weekend, with the CBI industrial trends survey for December due later this morning.

                    "body": "Good morning. You may know nuclear fusion as the power source for Iron Man\u2019s suit, or the basis of the Mr Fusion Home Energy Reactor that powers the, er, flux capacitor in Back to the Future. (If so, please stop reading, this is not a newsletter for nerds.) Yesterday, after the news was initially reported by the Financial Times, Joe Biden\u2019s energy secretary, Jennifer Granholm, confirmed a scientific breakthrough at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California that\u2019s a very long way from a superhero exoskeleton or a souped-up DeLorean: for the first time, a fusion reaction has produced more energy than it takes in. Which sounds miles better than a time machine, to be honest. Granholm called it \u201cone of the most impressive scientific feats of the 21st century\u201d. In theory, nuclear fusion reactors could one day be a plentiful source of power without any associated carbon emissions or radioactive waste. Climate crisis solved, and we can all get back to obsessing over Harry and Meghan on Netflix instead. Disappointingly, though, it isn\u2019t anything like that simple. Today\u2019s Grinch-like (but also very interesting!) newsletter, with Dr Michael Bluck, director of the Centre for Nuclear Engineering at Imperial College London, is about the long distance from a remarkable breakthrough to an energy utopia \u2013 and why fusion won\u2019t help us get to net zero. Here are the headlines. Five big stories  Asylum | Rishi Sunak has insisted he can clear a backlog of nearly 100,000 asylum claims by the end of next year as part of a five-point plan that includes changes to the law that will criminalise and then remove tens of thousands of people who claimed asylum after travelling to the UK by small boats. Strikes | The standoff between UK ministers, bosses and unions over pay showed no sign of reaching resolution on the first day of four weeks of planned industrial action. Rishi Sunak said that the government would not shift its position on pay ahead of another day of disrupted trains on Wednesday. Strep A | The cost of antibiotics used to strep A have risen more than tenfold in the UK in recent weeks, pharmacists have said, with many facing continued difficulties in sourcing supplies. Since mid-September there had been 60 deaths from invasive strep A infections in England, including 13 children. Plastics | Single-use plastic items including cutlery, plates and polystyrene cups are reportedly to be banned in England by the UK government after a consultation. Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Coffey, the environment secretary, is poised to unveil plans to phase out the items and replace them with biodegradable alternatives. Media | Harry &amp; Meghan, Netflix\u2019s documentary series about Britain\u2019s Prince Harry and his wife, racked up more viewing time on the streaming service than any other documentary during its first week, the company said. More than 28m households watched at least part of the series.  In depth: \u2018Predicting the future is difficult \u2013 there are huge hurdles to overcome\u2019  Before we get into the reservations, Dr Michael Bluck wants to be clear about something: the success of the US government\u2019s National Ignition Facility (NIF) in California in producing a net energy gain from a fusion reaction for the first time is remarkable. \u201cThis is a very impressive scientific achievement \u2013 it\u2019s a really, really hard thing to do,\u201d he said. Ever since the 1950s, scientists have sought to realise the theoretical promise of the same reaction that occurs in the core of the sun. But the old joke about fusion suggests how difficult that has been: it is always, always 30 years away. \u201cThese are very bright people doing amazing things,\u201d Bluck said. \u201cIt is a sort of holy grail.\u201d *** What is nuclear fusion? Whereas nuclear fission \u2013 the process at work in conventional nuclear power plants \u2013 generates energy by splitting heavy atoms like uranium, fusion works the other way round. A thermonuclear reaction fuses light elements like hydrogen into heavier ones like helium, thereby generating more energy than it takes to produce. (Nicola Davis explains this in more detail.) That process is known as \u201cignition\u201d. Beyond the obvious virtue of a net energy yield, \u201cIt\u2019s low carbon, it offers baseload [that is, consistent] energy unlike renewables at the moment, and you don\u2019t have to worry about it melting down or producing nuclear waste to the same extent,\u201d Bluck said. \u201cIt\u2019s a great vision.\u201d *** What does this announcement mean? There are two approaches to nuclear fusion: call them doughnuts v lasers. Magnetic confinement is the more common and longstanding method: picture, if you can, a doughnut-shaped machine, with nuclear fuel inside it kept afloat by magnetic fields and heated to incredible temperatures while the reaction takes place. The NIF is one of a smaller number of facilities trying something different: inertial confinement. In the pithy summary of White House science chief, Arati Prabhakar, yesterday: \u201cThey shot a bunch of lasers at a pellet of fuel [hydrogen plasma] and more energy was released from that fusion ignition than the energy of the lasers.\u201d The pellet, encased in diamond, sits in a tiny gold cylinder. By hitting it with 192 giant lasers for less than 100 trillionths of a second at more than 3 million celsius, scientists at NIF succeeded in producing 3 megajoules of energy from the 2.05 megajoules it took to make the reaction happen. But as good as that sounds, there are very significant barriers to further progress. \u201cIt\u2019s important to say that this is not trying to be a fusion reactor, it\u2019s simply trying to make fusion happen,\u201d said Bluck. \u201cBut it lacks almost everything that you need to make a viable reactor. \u201cSo, OK, the energy put in has resulted in a larger amount of energy coming out \u2013 but the big caveat is that it depends where you draw your perimeter: powering the lasers themselves required way more energy. You have to draw a slightly artificial dotted line around the vessel to say there\u2019s been a gain.\u201d The lasers may emit 2.05 megajoules, but they took about 500 megajoules of energy to power, though defenders of the experiment say that they are not optimally efficient and can be significantly improved. \u201cThere\u2019s also the fact that you would need the reaction to happen much more often,\u201d he went on. At the moment, the NIF manages it about ten times a week. \u201cYou need it many times a second.\u201d As well as all that, the energy produced in the NIF experiment is in the form of \u201chigh speed neutrons, X-rays, gamma rays, radiant heating \u2013 none of that is any use to us in and of itself. We\u2019ve got to convert it to stuff that can do work.\u201d That\u2019s very difficult to do without overheating the lasers that make the reaction happen in the first place. \u201cAnd that programme of work has not even been thought about yet.\u201d Magnetic confinement \u2013 the doughnut option \u2013 may not have reached the more-out-than-in milestone yet. \u201cBut they have been thinking about the real world stuff for many years. They\u2019ve sort of\u201d \u2013 you can hear the pain of this simplification in Bluck\u2019s voice as he speaks \u2013 \u201csolved the physics issues, and now they\u2019re looking squarely at the engineering issues.\u201d *** So does this news mean nuclear fusion plants are closer?  Again, sort of: something with a proven concept is closer than something without one. (Arthur Turrell argues for the importance of that step.) Yesterday, Jennifer Granholm said that Joe Biden had set a target of \u201ca commercial fusion reactor within 10 years\u201d. What\u2019s possible? \u201cPredicting the future is difficult,\u201d allowed Bluck. \u201cBut I think I\u2019m being optimistic in saying 50 years for inertial confinement being in practical use \u2013 it\u2019s between 50 years and never. There are huge hurdles to overcome.\u201d Kim Budil of the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory said yesterday that \u201ca few decades of research on the underlying technologies could put us in a position to build a power plant\u201d. Could magnetic confinement work sooner? \u201cI think that\u2019s ambitious, too,\u201d said Bluck. \u201cA demonstrator by 2050 \u2013 OK, that could be possible. But that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s cost effective to scale up.\u201d *** But can it help reach net zero? Some advocates of fusion would say that Bluck is being too pessimistic \u2013 but even in best case scenarios, it is hard to see fusion as a useful part of the changes needed to make net zero a reality. It is cumulative emissions that matter to avoiding the worst impact of the climate crisis, and so even if fusion plants are online at scale by 2050, that is too late. Nonetheless, investors in fusion \u2013 like Jeff Bezos and Peter Thiel \u2013 are persuaded of its revolutionary potential. \u201cThere is a degree of utopian zeal,\u201d said Bluck. \u201cYou\u2019re not a billionaire worthy of the name unless you\u2019re investing in ambitious devices. What it will mean for getting to net zero by 2050 is realistically nothing. I do worry sometimes that it can suck the air out of other more viable solutions.\u201d *** So is there any point in pursuing fusion power? Absolutely! For one thing, Bluck might be wrong: \u201cThere might be that significant step forwards that changes things suddenly. But we should be careful not to overestimate that possibility.\u201d Still, nuclear fusion doesn\u2019t have to be about solving the climate crisis to be worthwhile. The more realistic role for fusion, Thomas Nicholas writes in this 2019 piece for the Conversation, is \u201cas an energy source in a post carbon society\u201d. And so long as it doesn\u2019t become an excuse for ignoring the urgency of the only realistic solution to the climate crisis, a rapid transition to renewables, it\u2019s not like it presents much competition for funding: the total investment in private companies working on fusion ever is about $4.8bn, the Fusion Industry Association says. In comparison, clean energy investment in 2022 totalled $1.4tn, of which $472bn went on renewable power. \u201cNone of this means fusion doesn\u2019t have potential,\u201d Bluck said. \u201cBut you have to be able to say what you\u2019re going to do in between.\u201d Pondering the holy grail, he added: \u201cI don\u2019t think they ever found it, did they?\u201d What else we\u2019ve been reading  Andrew Gregory and Denis Campbell spent 33 hours in an NHS hospital, and their findings unveiled just how deep the crisis in the health service has gotten.

                    "body": "When I was younger the phrases around work were largely of the \u201cYou Don\u2019t Have To Be Mad To Work Here\u201d variety. Office humour is a hell of a drug. \u201cSARCASM is one of the free services I offer\u201d propped on a desk alongside a family of gonks and three cooling coffees. \u201cWhen you EXCEL they always SPREADSHEET about you.\u201d It was good stuff! It kept us going through the dark days of the mid-2000s, before the world as we know it emerged, with its sickness and crop tops, and endless milks. And before work became so complicated and so changeable we were required to create whole new phrases and grammar to try to explain it. The latest is \u201cquiet hiring\u201d \u2013 when employers ask workers to shift their roles rather than employ new staff, which is the younger sibling of \u201cquiet quitting\u201d \u2013 doing the minimum your job requires. That\u2019s another one, a phrase built to help us re-conceptualise the ways we\u2019re forced to work, especially since the pandemic, which slowly wrung out the last possibilities of joy from work\u2019s withered flannel. My colleagues and I are currently working from home, or \u201cWFH\u201d (along with the new phrases came a file of correct pronunciations, and this, I can tell you, is pronounced like a dog sneezing), which means this month we have missed two deskmates\u2019 birthdays, and so, two cakes. You may have heard by now that Professor Susan Jebb, chairwoman of the Food Standards Agency, recently announced that bringing birthday cakes to work should be considered as socially unacceptable as passive smoking. It was, admittedly, an odd news story \u2013 the Times seems to have set up its own commission, where knowledgable people like Jebb contributed ideas about health in a nuanced way, and then the paper reported it with a shocked headline as if she was launching a culture war to ban our biscuits. But still. Battle lines were drawn.  Who was this woman and why was she coming for our cakes, cried the internet, our cakes, the final flake of pleasure us flailing workers had left! Cakes should not be banned, people suggested \u2013 colleagues who say, \u201cOh, I shouldn\u2019t,\u201d when offered a piece should, or \u201cI\u2019m off sugar.\u201d Love letters to Colin the Caterpillar \u2013 his moist chocolate loins, the transgressive pleasure of biting into an eyeball \u2013 sat alongside essays on how Jebb\u2019s suggestion was another example of wokeness gone mad. Me, I loved it all. I mean, I scoffed, of course I did. A slice of cake around the printer is unlikely to have any health risks for the majority of us. Even two. Even two, eaten using a magazine as a plate and a ballpoint pen as a knife. Because a thousand things decide whether or not a person will become obese, quite aside from their willpower around dessert \u2013 it\u2019s a confused and confusing combination of age, metabolism, mental health, medications, genetics, class and money that decides the state of a body. But, as usual, the messaging has been simplified and scrubbed until it\u2019s so flimsy it appears like this, as a sharp-nailed swipe at office cake. That\u2019s part of the reason I remain on the side of cake. The other became clear when curled with my daughter watching the new series of Junior Bake Off, where child bakers were tasked with making cakes that illustrated something they would prioritise if they were prime minister. One boy made a cake that called for neurodiversity to be better understood, another made a bed, symbolising his policy to end homelessness. It was equal parts adorable and upsetting, these genius kids, able to both make a quite delicious-looking little sponge and quickly describe the thing that adults were failing at; the thing which kept them up at night. They were judged on their bakes, but the real judgment was on us, the old and voting public, who continue to let down our children with bad choices and fear. I thought about cake as a symbol and I thought about work. It feels clear to me that the meaning of all these new phrases about work, like \u201cquiet hiring\u201d, are less important than the fact we feel a need to create and update the language at all. They\u2019re a record of how we are struggling to understand the changing landscape of work and trying to make it all right in our minds. And in the same way, this debate about office cake misses the point. Four o\u2019clock, the jangle of awkward song, the heaving oneself up to marvel at a traybake \u2013 it\u2019s about taking a pause in the day for a tiny celebration, acknowledging a life outside work, one where we were once kids and birthdays were important, and forcing a moment of human connection across a Victoria sponge. A plate of supermarket cupcakes, icing so thick it briefly paralyses your teeth, a round of under-brewed tea, a Twix bought as an in-joke and one unexplained Revel on a tray. Susan Jebb, my friend, these are the things of life! And to my sweet-toothed comrades, still toiling through the discourse, this argument about cake\u2026 it\u2019s not about cake at all.

                    "body": "Last week it was Gareth Bale who was the subject of great adulation, in these parts at least, but this was a night that belonged to his longstanding sidekick Wayne Hennessey. On an evening when Hennessey became the third Welshman to reach 100 caps for his country, a youngster at the other end of his career, Rubin Colwill, scored his first senior goal to cancel out Tomas Soucek\u2019s opener for the Czech Republic.  Bale arrived from the bench for the final nine minutes and forced a fine save from an awkward angle but it is fair to say he has ample credit in the bank. It was always going to be impossible for this friendly to live up to anything remotely close to the joyous scenes here six days ago, when Bale\u2019s double put Wales within a game of a first World Cup since 1958, but while the concourses were empty by comparison, a lively draw was played at an engaging pace in front of a crowd that departed with Friday\u2019s draw in Qatar at the forefront of their minds. Brennan Johnson was particularly lively and came close to notching a winner. A visibly emotional Hennessey was withdrawn to a warm ovation after an hour and after departing the pitch he made his way along the home dugout, shaking hands with backroom staff and substitutes. At the end of a long line Bale was waiting to give him a bear hug. He was never going to miss Hennessey\u2019s special occasion. The pair have become best friends since meeting on Wales Under-21s duty and both described their close relationship as a \u201cbromance\u201d in the buildup to this game. At full time Bale was quick to push the goalkeeper in front of the Canton Stand to ensure he basked in his achievement. \u201cIt was really nice for the supporters at the end to show their appreciation,\u201d the interim Wales manager, Robert Page, said. \u201cHe is an absolute legend and deserves all the plaudits he is going to get. His best mate, Baleo, made sure that a fuss was made of him and it was an honour to be part of it as well. \u201cBaleo wanted to be involved on his best mate\u2019s big moment. It was vice-versa when he got his [Bale celebrated 100 caps in November], and Gunts [Chris Gunter, last March].\u201d  Page said he would be \u201clike every other Welsh supporter out there watching the draw\u201d with a playoff final against either Scotland or Ukraine primed for June. Page made wholesale changes \u2013 Hennessey was the only player to keep his place from Thursday\u2019s victory over Austria \u2013 but the system remained the same, Johnson and Rabbi Matondo playing either side of Colwill, the teenage Cardiff forward. Aaron Ramsey was omitted from the squad altogether and Ben Davies was absent after returning to Tottenham as a precaution. \u201cWe have to show respect to their clubs,\u201d Page said. \u201cThe most important game was against Austria. Job done. We didn\u2019t need to risk Aaron. I made that decision not to have him and Joe Allen in the 23 [-man squad].\u201d Before kick-off Hennessey was presented with a gold cap and a commemorative award pitchside by his childhood hero, Neville Southall, and the Football Association of Wales president, Steve Williams. Beyond Hennessey\u2019s special occasion, the game also raised funds for the Disasters Emergency Committee to help Ukraine, with the team making a donation and any FAW profits from staging the game will go towards the humanitarian appeal. If the thought of Wales rousing themselves after Austria felt ambitious, this was probably the last trip the Czech Republic wanted, days on from losing their World Cup playoff semi-final in Sweden.  Hennessey\u2019s first start for Wales came against the same opposition, across town at the Millennium Stadium in 2007, against a team spearheaded by Milan Baros and Jan Koller, and he made a smart save here before the visitors opened the scoring. Onrej Lingr was first to Jaroslav Zeleny\u2019s cross and an alert Soucek smacked the loose ball home from near to the penalty spot. Johnson was electric down the right flank and twice went close to nudging Wales in front in the second half. It was no surprise the Nottingham Forest forward laid on Wales\u2019s leveller two minutes after Soucek struck. Johnson latched on to Gunter\u2019s floated pass, eased past Tomas Petrasek and cut the ball back for Colwill to expertly sweep into the corner. \u201cThe problem we have is keeping up with him,\u201d Page said of Johnson. \u201cBrennan has a great future in front of him.\u201d"

                    "body": "Eddie Howe has defended his decision to make wholesale changes to his side for Newcastle United\u2019s shock FA Cup third round defeat at Sheffield Wednesday on Saturday night, explaining that fatigue played its part. With half an eye on Tuesday\u2019s home Carabao Cup quarter-final against Leicester, Howe made eight changes to the team which had earned a draw at Arsenal on Tuesday. But the decision backfired when Josh Windass\u2019s second-half double ended Newcastle\u2019s 15-game unbeaten run and sent them out of the competition to League One opponents for the second consecutive season.  \u201cI think you pick it looking ahead at future games of course,\u201d Howe said. \u201cWe have a very quick turnaround, a late kick-off today, and I felt I saw some fatigue in the Arsenal performance. \u201cThe lads gave everything and I felt it would have been unwise of me to pick the same team for this game and for Leicester as well. I am not sure the lads were physically able to give it their best if I did that. Hence the changes.\u201d Howe left the regular starters Fabian Sch\u00e4r and Callum Wilson on Tyneside, while Kieran Trippier, Bruno Guimar\u00e3es \u2013 who came off the bench to halve the deficit with 21 minutes remaining \u2013 Miguel Almir\u00f3n and Joe Willock were all introduced as second-half substitutes. That meant opportunities for the fringe players Jamaal Lascelles, Elliot Anderson, Matt Ritchie and Jacob Murphy. Howe felt the results of those changes were mixed. \u201cWe\u2019re aware that we don\u2019t have the deepest squad in the Premier League,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are light on numbers but we feel high on quality. Injuries will dictate how stretched you feel. We had an opportunity to play a lot of players that haven\u2019t played a lot of minutes this season. I thought there were some positives and negatives within their performances. But I think it\u2019s probably better that I analyse that in the cold light of day.\u201d One positive for Newcastle was the return of Alexander Isak. The club\u2019s record signing has been out since picking up an injury while on international duty with Sweden in September. But the striker enjoyed a lively 45-minute appearance that would have been marked by a goal but for a pair of saves by Cameron Dawson.  Howe confirmed that the plan was always for Isak to be withdrawn at the interval, while also explaining that Allan Saint-Maximin was due to start the game only to pull out after Friday\u2019s training session through illness. \u201cIt was a huge disappointment that he missed out,\u201d said Howe. \u201cWe hope to get Maxi back to full fitness because he\u2019s a gamechanger, a match-winner. With him in the team tonight, the result is potentially different.\u201d Sheffield Wednesday\u2019s manager, Darren Moore, said: \u201cTonight was special. Eddie is doing a great job there so to beat them in the form they\u2019ve been in, it makes it a special night. We need to savour the moment.\u201d"

                    "body": "\u201cI saw a stat that Luka Modric has played in around 42% of all Croatia\u2019s international games. On quick research, I found one player who can beat that (Fatos Beciraj of Montenegro at 67.5%  but is there anyone else who has played in an even higher percentage of their nation\u2019s games?\u201d asks Richard Wilson. Let\u2019s start with a bit of housekee \u2026 wait, come back! There are so many different statistical resources on the internet, and a dispiritingly small number of them agree on, for example, how many games Gibraltar have played (belated spoiler alert!). So in the name of consistency we\u2019ve taken the relevant data from RSSSF.com, adding this week\u2019s games and cross-checking with the equally comprehensive eu-football.info. Our first port of call is a principality in the eastern Pyrenees. \u201cIldefons Lima has played in 70.7% of Andorra\u2019s games (133 of 188) ,\u201d writes James Turley. \u201cHe played at Wembley last year, aged 41, and hasn\u2019t retired yet so that figure could yet inch higher.\u201d Dara O\u2019Reilly has the names of a couple of Kosovans. \u201cSince their accession to Fifa in 2014, Kosovo have played 62 recognised international matches,\u201d writes Dara. \u201cTorino\u2019s Mergim Vojvoda have featured in 45 of them, while another Serie A stopper, Napoli\u2019s Amir Rrahmani, has played 44. That\u2019s 72.9% and 71%, respectively.\u201d  There are a few candidates in the Gibraltar team, as mentioned by David Ekstrand and Ben Blatch-Hanlon among others. Gibraltar have played 66 full internationals, of which Liam Walker has appeared in 59 (or 89.4%), Roy Chipolina 57 (86.4%) and Joseph Chipolina 47 (71.2%).  Gibraltar\u2019s stats will change over time but Saarland\u2019s are probably set in stone. \u201cSaarland was a French protectorate partitioned from Germany after the second world war,\u201d notes Phil Mollicone. \u201cBefore rejoining the Federal Republic of Germany in 1957, Saarland played 19 internationals. Of those, the defender Waldemar Philippi played 18, or 94.7%.\u201d It\u2019s worth mentioning a couple of other Saarland players: Herbert Martin won 17 caps, playing in 89.5% of games, and Gerhard Siedl 16 (or 84.2%). Philippi\u2019s record is pretty impressive, but we may have found a man who played in 100% of his country\u2019s games. Stuart Fryer points out that the Dutch East Indies \u2013 a colony that later became Indonesia \u2013 played five official internationals in the 1930s, including one match at the 1938 World Cup. \u201cI haven\u2019t been able to find the team for their final game, a friendly against the Netherlands,\u201d notes Stuart, \u201cbut the majority of the squad played in at least three of their five competitive games, and one, Hong Dien, played in at least four of their five games.\u201d According to RSSSF, Hong Dien (or THE Hong Djien as they call him) appeared in that final game, which makes it five out of five. And if you\u2019re not satisfied by that, there\u2019s a more modern example. Navin Patel points out that the Gibraltar women\u2019s team includes six players who have appeared in all six of their internationals: Kyrelle Revagliatte, Tiffany Viagas, Reighann Mascarenhas-Olivero, Naomi Victor, Joelle Gilbert and Shania Robba. Neighbours across borders (2) In last week\u2019s Knowledge we looked at neighbouring football clubs in different countries. And there are loads more, so many that we\u2019re going to present them without comment and in no particular order \u2026 \u201cCarlisle United in Cumbria are just 19 miles from Annan Athletic in Scottish League Two. Even closer from Carlisle are Gretna, who play in the Scottish Lowland League,\u201d writes Peter Hunt.  \u201cDundalk FC in the League of Ireland Premier Division (ground \u2013 Oriel Park) and Warrenpoint Town FC (ground \u2013 Milltown) in the Northern Ireland Football Premier Division are 35km apart by road but only 16km as the crow flies,\u201d suggests Paul Callan. Also: \u201cIt\u2019s only 16 miles between Oriel Park and Newry City\u2019s ground,\u201d adds Johnny Turner. Paul has another: \u201cDerry City FC (ground: The Ryan McBride Brandywell Stadium) and Finn Harps FC (ground: Finn Park, Ballybofey, Co. Donegal) both play in the Premier Division of the League of Ireland (although Derry City is in N. Ireland) and are 40km apart by road.\u201d \u201cThe distance between Ju\u00e1rez\u2019s Estadio Ol\u00edmpico Benito Ju\u00e1rez and El Paso Locomotive\u2019s Southwest University Park is just 1.5 miles/2.4km,\u201d points out Liam Searle, \u201cthough in reality it\u2019d take an hour to walk.\u201d \u201cSan Diego Loyal SC (playing in USL, second division in the USA) and Club Tijuana (playing in Liga MX, first division in Mexico),\u201d begins Kevin McAllister. \u201cThe distance from Torero Stadium in San Diego to Caliente Stadium in Tijuana is 25 miles.\u201d  \u201cLaredo Heat SC in Texas and Nuevo Laredo Bravos CF across the Rio Grande river in Mexico,\u201d suggests Eddie Bellion, a retired Fifa referee. \u201cProbably not much more than 10 miles between them.\u201d \u201cDetroit City Football Club and Windsor TFC in Ontario, Canada,\u201d begins Mike Ruddy. \u201cAccording to Google Maps, the teams\u2019 stadiums are 9.5 miles apart, whether crossing the Detroit River by bridge or tunnel.\u201d \u201cDo not forget Gibraltar\u2019s Victoria stadium, where all club teams in Gibraltar play,\u201d shouts Nick Corea. \u201cIt is located less than 1.5km from Estadio Municipal de La L\u00ednea de la Concepci\u00f3n, where Spanish third division (sort of, it gets complicated after Segunda; ask Sid Lowe) side Real Balomp\u00e9dica Linense play. They\u2019re probably the closest stadiums in different countries to host international matches, with Gibraltar playing at Victoria and two nations, Spain and Andorra, hosting in La L\u00ednea.\u201d \u201cI\u2019d like to nominate FC Helsing\u00f8r and Helsingborgs IF,\u201d nominates William Jansen. \u201cHelsing\u00f8r are leading the second tier in Denmark and Helsingborgs IF were just promoted to the Swedish top flight. Helsing\u00f8r is just 5km from Helsingborg. The teams play an annual pre-season friendly known as \u2018The \u00d8resund Derby\u2019 (named after the strait between the countries).\u201d \u201cHow about KFC Kom\u00e1rno in the Slovak Second Division and Kom\u00e1romi VSE in the Hungarian Third (West)?\u201d muses Peterjon Cresswell. \u201cThey represent Kom\u00e1rno and Kom\u00e1rom, actually one town until a century ago. Now they\u2019re divided by the Danube and a border running down the middle of it. Unfortunately, the Gods of football decree that although the opposing neighbours are only 1.5km apart, the grounds are 19km as KFC play in Hurbanovo just outside Kom\u00e1rno.\u201d \u201cND Gorica of Slovenia play in \u0160portni Park Nova Gorica in Nova Gorica,\u201d mails Tim Dockery. \u201cAcross the border in Italy are AS Pro Gorizia, who play at the Stadio Campagnuzza. According to Google Maps, the distance between the two stadiums as the crow flies is 2.15 km, but on foot it would be 2.8km.\u201d  Tim has another example from South America. \u201cMonumental Rio Parapit\u00ed is the fifth largest stadium in Paraguay and hosted a number of games at the 1999 Copa Am\u00e9rica. It is also the home of Club 2 de Mayo of Paraguay\u2019s second tier. Across the avenue in Brazil, is the Estadio Municipal Aral Moreira, home to SE Pontaporanense. The distance between the two stadiums is 2.3km as the crow flies, but 2.5km if you were to walk.\u201d \u201cNice and Monaco, grounds 20km apart across an international border,\u201d writes Charles of the Ligue 1 sides. \u201cWrexham obviously play in the English system but there are a plethora of Welsh Premier League teams around them,\u201d reports Micky Smith. \u201cThe closest is Gresford Athletic, who play in Cymru North (second tier) at a mere 5.7km door to door.\u201d \u201cIs it worth throwing in The New Saints (Welsh Premier League and regular participants in European football) and St Martins (NWCL Division 1 South for now)?\u201d asks Steve Howard. Yes. \u201cBoth share the Park Hall Stadium in Oswestry, England, yet the New Saints are \u2018Welsh\u2019 and St Martins play in the English pyramid.\u201d Then of course there\u2019s the one-club case of Chester City \u2026 And finally, an amendment. \u201cNever mind Fortuna Sittard,\u201d writes Wim Joefs (and others). The Roda JC stadium in Kerkrade, the Netherlands, is less than 15km from Alemmania Aachen.\u201d  Can you help? \u201cBetween 1911 and 1927, there was a run of 13 consecutive FA Cup finals in which the runners-up failed to score (14 matches if you include the 1912 replay),\u201d notes John Stephenson. \u201cAre there any examples of longer consecutive runs in other club finals anywhere?\u201d   \u201cIvo Stas is legendary for scoring an own goal against Aston Villa while playing for Banik Ostrava in 1990. Villa subsequently signed him; he promptly picked up an injury in his first training session and never featured for Villa. Are there any other players who scored for their team without ever playing for them?\u201d asks Stuart Fryer.   Mail us your questions or tweet @TheKnowledge_GU. "

                    "body": "Close games and exciting finishes have been a highlight of the Cricket World Cup so far, but it seems Australia have no interest in anything less than total domination. Even when the opposition have felt like they are in with a chance, whether it is through a strong batting performance to set a record total for a chase or taking multiple quick wickets to see off the top order cheaply, Meg Lanning\u2019s side simply refuses to be beaten. What kind of person, then does it take to walk into a team this dominant and not only hold her own, but excel? Enter Alana King, the 26-year-old leg spinner who was selected in the team for the Ashes after an ACL injury ruled out incumbent Georgia Wareham. Unlike some of the teenage quicks who burst onto the scene each summer in the Women\u2019s Big Bash League, King did not appear as if from nowhere. Over the seven seasons of the WBBL, she gradually imprinted herself on the public consciousness until she became a familiar face. King believes this more gradual rise has been instrumental to her success.  \u201cPeople will get their opportunities at different times,\u201d she says from the Australian team\u2019s base in Wellington. \u201cI\u2019ve obviously had to wait a few more years than others, but it\u2019s meant that I\u2019m really happy with where I am and I\u2019m confident in where my cricket is. I think you\u2019ve got to, first and foremost, be comfortable in your own skin. And I have done that over the last few years.\u201d It is that confidence in herself that allows King to be so calm. When the pressure started to build in the game against South Africa and none of the six previous bowlers had been able to break the opening partnership, King was thrilled to be given the opportunity. \u201cTo be honest, I think I\u2019ve been blessed to be in those positions before whether it was at the Stars or the Scorchers,\u201d she said. \u201cI love to get the ball thrown to me in those type of situations, I think it really brings the best out in me, because you\u2019ve got to be on from ball one. And I really like that challenge.\u201d That aspect of her personality shines through in the way she approaches the difficult art of leg spin. While she had role models from her older brother to the king of spin himself Shane Warne, it was her willingness to embrace difference that first set her on that path. \u201cI just realised that everyone was bowling pace, I want to do something different,\u201d she said. \u201cI want to do something different\u201d could well be the motto for King\u2019s career. In every moment she is completely authentic and has no interest in compromising her beliefs to fit in with the crowd.   Over the past two seasons of the WBBL King, whose parents hail from Chennai in India, has consistently taken a knee before each game \u2013 even though many of her teammates have chosen not to. The eradication of racism and discrimination is a cause she believes in passionately. \u201cIt\u2019s to represent my family and what they\u2019ve been through,\u201d she says. \u201cI think having immigrant parents who moved over to Australia in the 80s, they faced a fair bit of discrimination. This is me standing up for them because they went through a lot.\u201d While she may sometimes be a lone figure in making this symbolic gesture, King feels supported by her teammates whether they stand or kneel with her. \u201cWhen I\u2019ve spoken to the team regarding why I want to do it, I\u2019ve had nothing but full support,\u201d she says. \u201cJust before the WBBL this season it was raised again, and I was happy to speak to the group and told them why I want to do it and what it means to me. I think it can be quite powerful when you\u2019ve got your whole team around you supporting what you\u2019re doing.\u201d The ever-increasing visibility of the WBBL and women\u2019s cricket more broadly has been important to King, not just for her own career, but because of the opportunities it offers to educate and raise awareness of the effects of racism and discrimination for people all over the world.  As her own platform has increased as a result of breaking into the Australian team and making her mark on one of the world\u2019s biggest stages, she has taken the time to reflect on how she can use that influence. While she belonged to a junior club that was diverse and inclusive, she knows that in many places in Australia, cricket has been a predominantly white sport. King hopes she can show people that is changing. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to use the platforms you\u2019re on,\u201d she says. \u201cIf I can inspire the younger generation of subcontinent kids to pick up a bat and ball and to aspire to play for Australia, even though they\u2019re from a subcontinent background, that\u2019s one thing that I\u2019m really passionate about.\u201d \u201cKnowing that they can play for this beautiful country that we live in and they\u2019ve got role models that they can look up to, whether it\u2019s Usman Khawaja in the men\u2019s team or myself in the women\u2019s team, I think that\u2019s big.\u201d In the immediate future, King\u2019s thoughts are firmly on Wednesday\u2019s semi-final against the West Indies and the opportunity to help propel Australia to a desperately sought World Cup win with her ability to take wickets in key moments. But her passion, determination and willingness to stand out from the crowd means that her long-term future is destined to be even more exciting \u2013 both on and off the field."

                    "body": "Last week, Matildas\u2019 coach Tony Gustavsson cut a customarily jovial figure as he helped announce February\u2019s Cup of Nations. The Swede had good reason to be convivial; the mini-tournament provides a chance to continue momentum from a successful November international window with a group-stage simulation against Spain, Jamaica and Czechia across Sydney, Gosford and Newcastle. The New South Wales slant of the host cities is clear, and has been met with predictable reactions. In the wake of furious backlash to the Australian Professional Leagues\u2019s sale of hosting rights for the next three A-Leagues grand finals to Sydney, Football Australia\u2019s announcement that the Matildas\u2019 next outings will be played exclusively in NSW was inevitably going to be conflated \u2013 even though the APL and FA are completely separate decision-making bodies. \u201cCan you please start calling yourselves the NSW Matildas?\u201d a response on Facebook asked. But do the comment sections have a point? Is there a bias toward New South Wales? Looking at the numbers, yes.  But there\u2019s some context. To start, the vast majority of Socceroos and Matildas internationals take place overseas: over 150 competitive matches and friendlies have been played beyond Australian shores since the start of 2010.  Of the fixtures played on home soil, nevertheless, there is a statistical basis that shows NSW is a preferred host. Since 2010, the state, per data supplied by Football Australia, has hosted 57% of the Matildas\u2019 home games and 46% of the Socceroos. Victoria follows next with 14% of women\u2019s and 26% of men\u2019s senior national team games, with Queensland the only other state to host a double-digit percentage \u2013 17% of Matildas games since 2010 and 15% of men\u2019s. On a more localised level, Sydney has hosted 33% of Matildas games, followed by Brisbane with 14%, and Melbourne and Newcastle with 10%. The Harbour City has hosted 44% of Socceroos\u2019 games across the period, with Melbourne\u2019s 24% and Brisbane\u2019s 14% the only other double-digit percentage hosts. On a proportional basis, even accounting that NSW is the country\u2019s biggest state from both a football participation and population basis, it\u2019s an uneven split. According to Football Australia\u2019s most recent participation statistics covering 2021, NSW contained 41% of Australia\u2019s football participants while, per ABS statistics, the state is also home to around a third of the population. So why the disproportionality? One of the biggest factors is that the NSW government has simply been consistently far more willing to invest properly in hosting international football than other states; the upcoming Cup of Nations, for example, is being staged in partnership with Destination NSW. This, in theory, then frees up Football Australia to invest revenue that otherwise would have been spent on staging games elsewhere.  \u201cWe don\u2019t run sport, but we are always happy to partner, as we are with Football Australia, in supporting what sporting organisations want to do,\u201d said NSW minister for sport, Alister Henskens. \u201cWe, unashamedly, want to have the best sporting tournaments in Australia here in NSW.\u201d In recent times, there have also been other, external factors forcing the issue. The Matildas\u2019 2020 Olympic qualifiers, for example, were hastily moved to NSW by the Asian Football Confederation amid concerns over a new, highly communicable virus emerging in the games\u2019 original host city, Wuhan. When international football was subsequently sent overseas by Australia\u2019s strict Covid border control policies, only the NSW government was willing to institute bespoke protocols that would allow the Matildas and Socceroos to stage home fixtures with restrictions still in effect a year and a half later. In 2022, the first year Australia was mostly free of Covid policies, the Matildas played six times at home but only once in Sydney: a 2-1 loss to Canada in the first football match played at the new Allianz Stadium. Just one other game was staged in NSW, a 2-0 win over Thailand in Gosford, with the others spread across Townsville, Canberra, Brisbane and Melbourne. With a Women\u2019s World Cup on the horizon, Adelaide\u2019s Hindmarsh Stadium and Perth Oval were both undergoing renovations during this period to bring them up to international standard. Playing three games in Australia during a World Cup year, the Socceroos spread their fixtures across Melbourne, Sydney and Brisbane.  \u201cIt is always Football Australia\u2019s desire to have our national teams play in as many cities and regions across the country as possible, where over the past decade all states and territories outside of Tasmania and the Northern Territory have hosted senior national team matches,\u201d a Football Australia spokesperson said. \u201cThere are many factors which go into determining where matches are ultimately played including venue availability and size of venue against expected demand, plus team movement and logistics. \u201cThere is also a commercial reality to any national team match, as staging games and hosting touring teams is an expensive exercise, so that\u2019s where Football Australia works with state and territory governments around their appetite to financially support the hosting of national team content. \u201cFootball Australia is committed to taking our senior and youth national teams to as many parts of Australia as possible and is eager to work with all state and territory governments to make this a reality.\u201d"

But if he couldn\u2019t see the large numbers of his own party\u2019s backbench MPs queueing up to voice their outrage at his proposal to restart fracking when he made his announcement a few weeks ago then he should certainly have been able to hear them. The Conservative Environment Network is already plotting to force another Truss U-turn. The Tory MP Brendan Clarke-Smith recently said on Question Time that he didn\u2019t want drilling in his constituency. Local communities from Lancashire to Sussex have been challenging fracking for a decade. Every single poll shows that the public are strongly opposed. And even if we frack in the UK, energy bills won\u2019t come down, since the gas will get sold on international markets, and global emissions will still increase, as exporter countries like Qatar and Norway won\u2019t reduce their own gas extraction by an equivalent amount \u2013 so that puts the planet firmly against it too.

Bye for now.     4.24am    As it happens, this is Australia\u2019s 100th ODI win against New Zealand. Now they will take it to the West Indies on Tuesday at this same venue. Lanning is praising the depth of her squad, especially the lower order who she says \u201ccan rescue our innings\u201d. She is, of course, referring to Gardner, who missed the start of Australia\u2019s campaign after testing positive for Covid but returned in indefatigable fashion. \u201cIt was great to have her back,\u201d Lanning says. \u201cObviously a tough 10 days for her but she\u2019s come back incredibly well. That innings certainly gave us the momentum heading into the bowling. We thought it was a good score without match-winning and probably went a bit too hard to get their key batters out.\u201d     4.15am    Speaking of Devine, she has just spoken about her side\u2019s performance and is disappointed with their batting display and says Australia\u2019s batting was the \u201cblueprint\u201d for success. \u201cThe reason we wanted to bowl first was to contain them and get a few more wickets and put the pressure on them,\u201d she says. \u201cGuess that shows the quality of the Australian side as, even though they were three to four down, had the run rate under control and were able to launch in the death overs.\u201d Now she\u2019s talking about Gardner\u2019s performance and Australia\u2019s all-round output with the bat. \u201cShe hit with the wind and was outstanding the way she played. We certainly would have to go back to our plans around how you gonna do it but, it\u2019s always tough with the wind and credit goes to Australia. We certainly can be better. We know this is a good cricket wicket and if we were able to keep wickets in hand, certainly a chasable target. Poor batting performance. The way Australians set it up, that\u2019s the blueprint.\u201d NZ next face South Africa in Hamilton on Thursday.     4.09am    And so it transpired, the White Ferns had Australia on the ropes during their innings at 164-4 at the close of the 40th over. Enter Gardner with her unbeaten 48 off 18 balls, which had the hosts reeling and then tasked with chasing 270. Perry\u2019s knock of 68 and her wicket with the ball has her named player of the match. Her dismissal of Devine was key in sucking the wind out of NZ\u2019s innings.  Updated at 4.10am GMT    4.05am   Australia beat New Zealand by 141 runs  The Kiwis are 128 all out and Lanning\u2019s team win their third match on the hop and regain top spot in the standings, with India in second, South Africa third and NZ fourth. This is a big result for both teams. While Australia are in the box seat for the semis, the path is less straightforward for their trans-Tasman counterparts.     4.01am   Wicket! Tahuhu 23 c Mooney b Gardner  Gardner bows to Tahuhu and she arcs her shot straight to deep mid-wicket, where Mooney\u2019s safe hands are waiting. She takes it, and Australia take the match.     3.59am    30th over: New Zealand 128-9 (Lea Tahuhu 23, Jess Kerr 6) Schutt sends down a delivery wide of off and Kerr\u2019s outside edge is in just the right position to send the ball to the ropes between short third and backward point. Another Kerr edge is almost caught and then, in the final ball of the over, Tahuhu chips and King runs in but can\u2019t quite get there.     3.54am   Wicket! Satterthwaite 44 c Lanning b Gardner  29th over: New Zealand 122-9 (Lea Tahuhu 22, Jess Kerr 1) Satterthwaite, for her impressive innings and a lone hand who helped keep her battling team afloat, is out off what would hardly even qualify as a shot. She scoops Gardner\u2019s delivery towards cover and Lanning makes a run for it. The captain almost looks as if she won\u2019t make it but make it she does, and Australia need one more wicket for victory.     3.51am    28th over: New Zealand 120-8 (Amy Satterthwaite 44, Lea Tahuhu 21) Schutt starts her second spell and conceded only two singles. There must be another wicket coming soon.     3.45am    27th over: New Zealand 118-8 (Amy Satterthwaite 43, Lea Tahuhu 20) Big appeal from Australia for lbw on Tahuhu facing Gardner! The White Ferns review. Delivery is good, but did it make contact with bat? Nope, it\u2019s pad first. But ball tracking shows it has pitched outside leg! Safe. Can this pair build a partnership at death\u2019s door?     3.40am    26th over: New Zealand 116-8 (Amy Satterthwaite 42, Lea Tahuhu 19) It\u2019s Satterthwaite\u2019s turn to put some runs on the board with two fours of her own. Against Wellington she places it perfectly over mid-wicket. The second is a mishit, an edge that races away behind and past the keeper. That\u2019s a bit lucky, but she\u2019ll take it.     3.37am    25th over: New Zealand 106-8 (Amy Satterthwaite 33, Lea Tahuhu 18) Tahuhu is going for it, and she may as well at this point. Go out swinging, as they say. She tests Ash Gardner on her first over and then swipes over cover for four. Two balls later she scoops another high, a catch-in-waiting that King cannot quite take. The ball scoots away to the ropes for another four. She\u2019s brought up NZ\u2019s century at least.     3.33am    24th over: New Zealand 95-8 (Amy Satterthwaite 32, Lea Tahuhu 8) Tahuhu hits Wellington for six! She connects perfectly with the delivery and sweeps up and over. It\u2019s almost a done deal but Mooney is there, and we\u2019ve seen what Mooney can do. She takes a courageous leap. She\u2019s just in front of the ropes and looking up into the sun, which doesn\u2019t help her cause as she back-steps into the boundary and the ball sails past. That was nice to watch.     3.30am   Wicket! Rowe 6 c Perry b Schutt  23rd over: New Zealand 87-8 (Amy Satterthwaite 31, Lea Tahuhu 1) This is surely one of the most straightforward catches of Parry\u2019s distinguished career. Schutt roles over her delivery, Rowe is static and can\u2019t set herself. She pops it up and Perry says thank you very much. Lea Tahuhu comes in and faces two balls for no return before pumping the third straight down the ground for one.     3.24am    22nd over: New Zealand 85-7 (Amy Satterthwaite 30, Hannah Rowe 6) The tail wags a little as Satterthwaite smacks a four past cover. Wellington tries again and she flat misses before picking up a single and watching Rowe drive for two.  Updated at 3.26am GMT    3.23am    21st over: New Zealand 78-7 (Amy Satterthwaite 25, Hannah Rowe 4) Rowe takes a few balls to get herself set, blocking and nudging Schutt before driving her for four. Promising start.  Updated at 3.26am GMT    3.21am   Wicket! Jensen 0 c McGrath b Wellington  20th over: New Zealand 73-7 (Amy Satterthwaite 24, Hannah Rowe 0) Hayley Jensen has barely taken her place and she\u2019s out for a golden duck! Wellington sends her delivery outside off and Jensen is off balance, popping the ball high enough for McGrath to take the catch at cover point. Jensen was invited into that and got done hook, line and sinker. A warm welcome to Hannah Rowe.  Updated at 3.23am GMT    3.17am   Wicket! Martin 19 lbw b Wellington, New Zealand 73-7  Lanning is tweaking her fielding set-up with each ball. She doesn\u2019t even need them though because Wellington has done it all herself. She\u2019s not the quickest of the spinners but it\u2019s full-flighted and lands at Martin\u2019s toes if not on them. The batter has started walking before the umpire has even given the signal.     3.13am    19th over: New Zealand 70-5 (Amy Satterthwaite 22, Katey Martin 18) There\u2019s a cry of \u201ccome on Schutter\u201d as she mixes up her deliveries and forces the batters to adjust basically with every ball they face. Satterthwaite steals a single but almost pays for it with her wicket, only marginally making it back to her crease. Had the fielder made a direct hit she would not have been so lucky. There\u2019s a bit of a break in proceedings after the over as Martin takes time out to talk to coaches. The umpires are there too. It\u2019s unclear what the problem is, if it\u2019s injury or if she\u2019s feeling unwell. She hasn\u2019t taken a hit. After a couple of minutes she puts back on her helmet and continues.     3.08am    18th over: New Zealand 68-5 (Amy Satterthwaite 21, Katey Martin 17) Wellington is giving nothing away, bar a couple of singles. Australia\u2019s bowling has been ... compact. Ungenerous. Unyielding. Here\u2019s Beth Mooney\u2019s catch from earlier. Well worth the watch.      3.04am    17th over: New Zealand 66-5 (Amy Satterthwaite 20, Katey Martin 16) Another bowling change-up with Schutt coming in. Much later than anticipated, but in nonetheless. Her opening over is marked by two wides.     3.01am    16th over: New Zealand 61-5 (Amy Satterthwaite 18, Katey Martin 15) We have some spin for the first time! Leggie Amanda Wellington makes her entrance. I\u2019ve cracked open some Easter eggs to mark the occasion. I\u2019m aware it\u2019s not yet Easter but chocolate tastes better in Easter egg form. I am one of those people at the supermarket two months early, pouncing on the low-brow Cadbury specials. But we digress. Martin drives Wellington\u2019s first delivery but gets no runs for her efforts. She evades the slips in her second for a single before she and Satterthwaite trade singles.  Updated at 3.01am GMT    2.57am    15th over: New Zealand 57-5 (Amy Satterthwaite 16, Katey Martin 13) NZ are settling a little bit, at a crucial time, and make two boundaries against McGrath. Satterthwaite hits the first. Cuts it, more accurately. Martin follows with her own four, pouncing early for a pull shot that races away to the ropes. Another couple of singles makes for a fruitful over.     2.52am    14th over: New Zealand 47-5 (Amy Satterthwaite 11, Katey Martin 8) Brown takes over from McGrath again. She bowls two dot balls to Satterthwaite, who then hits her for three to cover. Martin has a crack and her timing is off on the first ball but she has her eye in for the second and takes a couple of runs with a nice chip past mid-wicket. Time for drinks.     2.48am    13th over: New Zealand 42-5 (Amy Satterthwaite 8, Katey Martin 6) Interestingly, Australia\u2019s run score was almost identical at the 13th-over mark of their innings. They had 44. The main difference, of course, is that they were 44-1.     2.46am    12th over: New Zealand 41-5 (Amy Satterthwaite 7, Katey Martin 6) I can hardly keep up. Mackay fell in the first ball of this over and before it is out Katey Martin, who has literally just come to the crease, is given out for lbw. But this one too is reviewed and successfully. There was bat on that, she\u2019s edged it (just), and is safe for now. Mind you, she\u2019d just hit Brown for four on her second ball and stole a quick two runs two balls thereafter, which is more to say than her preceding teammates.     2.43am   Wicket! Mackay 1 lbw b Brown  This is dire. Dire straits. Darcie Brown, the sultan of swing, opts for one straight down the middle that smashes Mackay in the pads and looks plumb. Umpire calls lbw but New Zealand don\u2019t think so \u2013 or they are just desperate \u2013 and review it. It\u2019s pad first and line is good.      2.39am   Wicket! Green 3 c Healy b McGrath  11th over: New Zealand 35-4 (Amy Satterthwaite 7, Frances Mackay 1) Tahlia McGrath makes her way up for her first over of the innings and it takes her a measly four balls to exert her influence and take another wicket. It\u2019s regulation, too, a seamer that Green pokes outside off-stump and Healy is there for an easy catch. Frances Mackay walks out just in time for Satterthwaite to pump a four.     2.33am    10th over: New Zealand 29-3 (Amy Satterthwaite 2, Maddy Green 3) Brown looks to be on her way to a maiden over to Green until the latter drives through extra cover for two. Before that she was forced to defend mainly. Brown has conceded 11 runs and taken two wickets from five overs. Power play is over as of now. At this point in Australia\u2019s innings they had lost one wicket. For the Kiwis it is three.     2.29am    9th over: New Zealand 27-3 (Amy Satterthwaite 2, Maddy Green 1) Looks windy out there. The broadcasters are doing their broadcasting thing and zooming in on trees swaying in the breeze. A strategically placed camera also captures an ICC flag fluttering around. The punters on the hill don\u2019t seem to mind the windy Welly conditions. Undoubtedly they are more concerned with what is happening on the field. Perry bowls an over featuring one single apiece for Satterthwaite and Green.     2.26am   Wicket! Bates 16 c McGrath b Brown  8th over: New Zealand 25-3 (Amy Satterthwaite 1, Maddy Green 0) Will this turn into a collapse of all proportions? I don\u2019t want to be presumptive, but the pressure appears to be getting to the White Ferns. Bates tries a pull shot, presumably to break the run drought of the past few overs. She does it despite being crowded by Brown\u2019s barrelling, shortish delivery. It catches the top edge and McGrath is at mid-wicket waiting for it. It\u2019s Maddy Green\u2019s turn.     2.20am    7th over: New Zealand 24-2 (Suzie Bates 16, Amy Satterthwaite 0) The Kiwis are on the back foot, figuratively and literally \u2013 Australia\u2019s attack are not giving an inch. Brown has no interest in leaking cheap runs and she gives only a quick single to Bates in this over.     2.16am   Wicket! Amelia Kerr 1 c Mooney b Brown  6th over: New Zealand 23-2 (Suzie Bates 15, Amy Satterthwaite 0) What a catch from Mooney! That rivals Green\u2019s from earlier in the day. Brown is on song and again at a good length Kerr wraps her hands around her bat and drives hard, but Mooney is at second slip with an outstretched arm and a hand that does not make a mistake. Gone for one. NZ are surely in deep you know what right now. Amy Satterthwaite is up and gives Brown four dot balls to open her innings.     2.12am   Wicket! Devine 6 b Perry  5th over: New Zealand 23-1 (Suzie Bates 15, Amelia Kerr 1) Devine has her first boundary! She was superb in the World Cup warm-up match against Australia and this is the first sign in this one of what she can do. But she ain\u2019t gonna get the chance this time. Perry bowls wide of the crease and the ball curves in. Bates is caught out by the smart delivery and her own indecision, beaten on the inside edge as the ball hits the leg stump. Big wicket for Australia. Right-hander Amelia Kerr makes her way out to the crease.  Updated at 2.13am GMT    2.05am    4th over: New Zealand 18-0 (Suzie Bates 15, Sophie Devine 2) Brown is having a field day with the new ball. Her line and length is on point and that late swing is causing issues, beating the outside edge. The batter finds herself a little crowded on the penultimate ball but still manages a chip with enough momentum for two runs, and repeats the feat with a confident pull stepping up to a shorter ball.     2.02am    3rd over: New Zealand 13-0 (Suzie Bates 11, Sophie Devine 1) Perry pitches slightly short and a little wide allows Bates to bat straight, and straight she does bat through extra cover for a four. Mixed over from Bates, who judged a couple well but also mistimed a cut off a length delivery.     1.58am    2nd over: New Zealand 7-0 (Suzie Bates 5, Sophie Devine 1) Devine is off the mark facing a full-tossing Darcey Brown. No Megan Schutt to start in the bowling, interesting. Brown\u2019s next ball is flawless and draws flaws from Bates, who is lured into an attempted drive which she clean misses as the ball swings late and violently away.     1.53am    1st over: New Zealand 3-0 (Suzie Bates 3, Sophie Devine 0) Thanks Megan and hello all. Well Gardner finished off Australia\u2019s innings in excellent fashion as New Zealand slipped a little off the pedestal they\u2019d occupied throughout much of their opponents\u2019 innings. It\u2019s not an easy target, 270. What can they do? Bates and Devine are at the crease, the former is on strike. Perry opens the attack, kicking off with an inswinging full toss. A couple of dot balls are followed by a wide. Bates is late to the next delivery but the one after that is a cracker of a drive that yields three runs as McGrath chases it down just shy of the boundary.  Updated at 1.54am GMT    1.26am    Well thank you so much for joining me for the first innings of this key match. I\u2019m handing over to Emma Kemp now who will take you through New Zealand\u2019s batting innings. Paul Cockburn has noted via email that it\u2019s usually popular to bat first at the Basin, so maybe that will come into play later on. Hope you enjoy the rest of the match - I\u2019ll be back to cover another match with you soon!     1.23am   Australia 269-8  It was a very strong finish from Australia and New Zealand will be disappointed they lost control late in the innings. But they have some big hitting power and this score certainly isn\u2019t out of their reach. Australia will remember their warm up game where they set NZ a score over 300 and weren\u2019t able to defend it. Australia need to take wickets early and regularly if they hope to win this game. It\u2019s certainly a game that can go either way at this point and the way both teams start the next innings will be crucial.     1.19am    50th over: Australia 269-8 (Ash Gardner 48, Megan Schutt 0) And of course it\u2019s Tahuhu to bowl the final over, NZ will be hoping she can keep this score in check. It\u2019s a good start with Wellington run out early, but Gardner can\u2019t be contained and she takes two boundaries from the next two balls. Tahuhu beats her on the next ball and Gardner can\u2019t get bat on it. She hits the next one straight in the air and it should be a simple catch for Rowe, but she has too much time to think about it and fumbles it. Gardner punishes her with a six next ball.     1.16am   WICKET! Amanda-Jade Wellington 1 run out Mackay, Australia 253-8  A great underarm throw from Mackay gets Wellington out trying to grab a quick single.  Updated at 1.29am GMT    1.13am    49th over: Australia 253-7 (Ash Gardner 32, Amanda-Jade Wellington 0) Rowe comes on to bowl the penultimate over and Gardner takes her on right away, but it doesn\u2019t quite reach the boundary this time. Gardner keeps going though and a few balls later strikes a six straight down the ground and follows it up with a second consecutive six. Rowe bounces back with two excellent short balls that she dug in really well and forces Gardner to take her first two dot balls.      1.09am    48th over: Australia 239-7 (Ash Gardner 19, Amanda-Jade Wellington 0) Tahuhu is back for this over, but Gardner isn\u2019t intimidated, getting on strike on the second ball and immediately hitting it back over Tahuhu\u2019s head for an impressive six. King tries to do the same a couple of balls later, but she doesn\u2019t get hold of it and she has to go for two.      1.08am   WICKET! Alana King c Bates b Tahuhu, Australia 238-7  King tries to hit a big one back over the bowler\u2019s head, but she doesn\u2019t get all of it and Bates takes another simple catch, which is almost thwarted by her own teammate, but she holds on to it.     1.04am    47th over: Australia 229-6 (Ash Gardner 11, Alana King 1) Gardner doesn\u2019t even need one ball to get her eye in against Rowe, she just cuts one deftly for four immediately, then follows it up with a tidy single. McGrath sends one straight to Bates and brings Alana King to the crease. King nearly gives her wicket up immediately, hitting it straight back to Rowe, but she can\u2019t hold on.   Updated at 1.05am GMT    1.02am   WICKET! Tahlia McGrath 57 c Bates b Rowe, Australia 229-6  McGrath needed to keep pushing forward, but unfortunately she can\u2019t get this one past the field and Bates takes a simple catch.     1.00am    46th over: Australia 224-5 (Ash Gardner 6, Tahlia McGrath 57) Gardner establishes herself quickly and gets off the mark with a front foot drive for four. Straight out of Covid isolation and into the fire she moves quickly and keeps the pace up well.     12.57am    45th over: Australia 214-5 (Ash Gardner 0, Tahlia McGrath 53) Brilliant fielding from Tahuhu from her own bowling cuts off an almost certain four and keeps it to a dot. McGrath nearly takes out Perry a few balls later, but Perry ducks out of the way well and they bring up their 100 partnership next ball. But then Tahuhu takes Perry with a stunning catch and the game changes again.     12.56am   WICKET! Ellyse Perry 68 c Green b Tahuhu, Australia 214-5  It looked like a brilliant shot from Perry but Green came out of nowhere to sail through the air Deandra Dottin style to take a stunning catch.     12.51am    44th over: Australia 211-4 (Ellyse Perry 67, Tahlia McGrath 51) New Zealand is getting a little worried by Australia\u2019s acceleration as they race past 200. There is plenty for Sophie Devine to consider in how she finishes this innings out with her bowlers. Their plan to frustrate worked well early, but these two batters are feeling very much at ease now and aren\u2019t as susceptible to the frustration and pressure. They need to take one or both of these wickets to get back into the game and finish on a high.  Updated at 12.51am GMT    12.50am   50 for Tahlia McGrath  A great little knock from McGrath to save the innings when it looked like it was in big trouble.     12.47am    43rd over: Australia 199-4 (Ellyse Perry 64, Tahlia McGrath 42) Tahuhu is back and she tempts Perry into a wild shot, but it falls safely with no fielders around. Tahuhu is throwing in a few short balls and coming over the wicket to the right hander and forcing Perry to playing a bit more cautiously after that big shot. She then tempts a big shot from McGrath that gets top edge, but again it falls safely and this time races away to the boundary for four.      12.43am    42nd over: Australia 192-4 (Ellyse Perry 62, Tahlia McGrath 37) Amelia Kerr doesn\u2019t offer quite as many opportunities to the batters, but McGrath finds one late in the over with a big sweep to the boundary. There\u2019s a definite increase in intensity late in this innings.     12.40am    41st over: Australia 184-4 (Ellyse Perry 59, Tahlia McGrath 32) McGrath is upping the intent now, starting Jess Kerr\u2019s over with two fours. She can see the need for the run rate to increase into the last ten overs. Perry joins the party and brings up her fifty with a four, followed by a six from the free hit. It\u2019s a huge over - 20 runs from it.     12.39am   50 for Ellyse Perry  Perry gets a gift with a high full toss and she puts it away for four and brings up her half century.     12.36am    40th over: Australia 164-4 (Ellyse Perry 49, Tahlia McGrath 23) Perry is timing the ball really well but most of the time it isn\u2019t paying off in a big way. Her strike rate is well below where it could be on the basis of what some of these shots look like.      12.32am    39th over: Australia 159-4 (Ellyse Perry 46, Tahlia McGrath 22) The over starts with an excellent piece of fielding from Suzie Bates who cuts off an almost certain four from McGrath and restricts her to one. McGrath isn\u2019t deterred pulls out a brilliant straight drive that can\u2019t be cut off by the field two balls later.      12.30am    38th over: Australia 152-4 (Ellyse Perry 44, Tahlia McGrath 16) A chance early in the over, but it falls just short of Maddy Green. They play a little more cautiously after that but a big swing from McGrath late in the over brings about an appeal - Martin is convinced there\u2019s bat involved, but the review proves that it was clear. McGrath finishes with a single.     12.24am    37th over: Australia 148-4 (Ellyse Perry 43, Tahlia McGrath 14) Perry picks up three runs from Jensen straight away and then there are a few more singles from the over, but they\u2019ll be wanting to step up the boundaries.     12.20am    36th over: Australia 142-4 (Ellyse Perry 39, Tahlia McGrath 12) Now we get Jess Kerr back in the attack, picking up where she left off with her length balls. She played a big role in setting up the frustration of the Australian batters from the start and she continues that role in this over.     12.17am    35th over: Australia 140-4 (Ellyse Perry 38, Tahlia McGrath 11) McGrath starts with a four of her own against Jensen, driving it past long on to the boundary. She gets Perry back on strike immediately afterwards and she plays a nicely timed shot for one straight away. Plenty of nice shots this over, well-timed and good running but they will want to pick the speed up.     12.13am    34th over: Australia 133-4 (Ellyse Perry 37, Tahlia McGrath 5) Perry plays a straight drive back past Kerr for four in the middle of the over but can\u2019t get more runs away from Kerr.      12.11am    33rd over: Australia 128-4 (Ellyse Perry 33, Tahlia McGrath 4) McGrath gets away a nice shot against Rowe, but Amelia Kerr pulls out some excellent fielding to cut it off. Rowe gives away an unnecessary wide with a short ball, before dragging her length back. Australia are rotating the strike, but need to start moving quickly to get their run rate up before they close out their innings.      12.06am    32nd over: Australia 122-4 (Ellyse Perry 29, Tahlia McGrath 3) Kerr\u2019s first ball is good, but the second is looser and Perry punishes it immediately with a boundary. Kerr is good enough to adjust and follows up with a dot and a single to bring McGrath on strike. The Australians rotate the strike well through the over and are slowly pushing the run rate up.     12.01am    31st over: Australia 116-4 (Ellyse Perry 24, Tahlia McGrath 2) McGrath gets her first look at Rowe and takes her time getting a look at what she\u2019s doing with the ball. She picks up a single from the fourth and then Rowe throws in a nice change of pace to stop Perry charging down the wicket at her.     11.57pm    30th over: Australia 114-4 (Ellyse Perry 23, Tahlia McGrath 1) Kerr strikes immediately and brings McGrath to the crease, continuing with that excellent flight to build the pressure through four dot balls before McGrath manages a single from the last.     11.55pm   WICKET! Beth Mooney 30 b A Kerr, Australia 113-4  Kerr strikes immediately in her fifth over with a length ball outside off stump taking Mooney\u2019s stumps down.     11.53pm    29th over: Australia 113-3 (Ellyse Perry 23, Beth Mooney 29) Devine has used six bowlers so far, without bowling herself, so there are plenty of options there. Rowe starts this over with a wide before Perry brings up the 50 run partnership with a nice looking cut shot for a single. Mooney overs up a little chance, chipping one up, but it sails safely past the fielder. A quick single brings about a run out chance, but the throw is just wide from Amelia Kerr. Mooney uses the pace of the ball to steer the ball down past third for four late in the over to ease some more of the pressure.     11.49pm    28th over: Australia 104-3 (Ellyse Perry 21, Beth Mooney 24) Kerr is getting some really good flight through the air and gives away just two runs from the over.     11.47pm    27th over: Australia 102-3 (Ellyse Perry 20, Beth Mooney 23) Rowe comes back into the attack, having changed ends, and gives away three singles and then finishes with three dots.     11.42pm    26th over: Australia 99-3 (Ellyse Perry 19, Beth Mooney 21) It\u2019s fair to say this probably wasn\u2019t the score Australia was envisioning at the halfway mark in their innings, but Mooney and Perry are doing their best to get them back into a winning position. A review for a stumping early in Kerr\u2019s over, but Mooney is safe and she plays out a couple of balls before dashing down for a quick single. Perry finishes the over with caution.     11.38pm    25th over: Australia 97-3 (Ellyse Perry 19, Beth Mooney 20) Perry is finding her groove now and a very nicely played sweep shot goes straight to the boundary for four and she follows it up with another four before taking a single and giving the strike to Mooney. A straight drive beats Mackay and Mooney is able to rotate the strike back to Perry.      11.35pm    24th over: Australia 87-3 (Ellyse Perry 10, Beth Mooney 19) Mooney and Perry are getting some good shots away against Kerr, but Kerr is bowling well to her field and there aren\u2019t any boundaries on offer. However they are taking advantage of playing on a big ground by running twos whenever they can.     11.32pm    23rd over: Australia 83-3 (Ellyse Perry 9, Beth Mooney 16) Perry immediately gets off strike against Mackay and then Mooney finds some space, cutting one to deep backward point for two. There\u2019s a little bit more urgency in the running now approaching the halfway mark of the innings with the run rate still sitting well below four.      11.30pm    22nd over: Australia 79-3 (Ellyse Perry 8, Beth Mooney 13) Our first look at Amelia Kerr for this match and she starts with a full toss. But she gets away with it and Perry sends it straight to the field. It\u2019s a solid first over from her, with just a single from the last ball.      11.27pm    21st over: Australia 78-3 (Ellyse Perry 7, Beth Mooney 13) A little drop and run from Mooney on the first ball of Mackay\u2019s next over. A few little singles keep the runs going but then Mackay bowls one too full and Perry is able to take advantage and gets her first boundary, before following up with a single.     11.24pm    20th over: Australia 70-3 (Ellyse Perry 1, Beth Mooney 11) The Tahuhu v Mooney battle continues and Tahuhu continues to come over the wicket to the left hander, which has been working so well for her so far. She varies the length on the fourth with a good short ball that Mooney has to duck under. Tahuhu tries another on the final ball of the over, but it\u2019s called a wide and then Mooney is able to take a single to finish on the following ball.     11.20pm    19th over: Australia 68-3 (Ellyse Perry 1, Beth Mooney 10) Mackay is back after her wicket of Healy earlier in the match and Mooney gets one away for a single straight away. Perry is still watchful, she doesn\u2019t appear to be in a hurry to score quickly and plays out five dots.     11.17pm    18th over: Australia 67-3 (Ellyse Perry 1, Beth Mooney 9) Tahuhu starts around the wicket again and it\u2019s a very similar delivery to the one that got Haynes, but this one flies just over the stumps. Mooney gets bat on the second delivery, but her shot is cut off by some excellent fielding from Satterthwaite. She\u2019s not giving Mooney much at all this over, continuing the plan to frustrate that has been working so effectively so far. She concedes just one run from the over.     11.13pm    17th over: Australia 66-3 (Ellyse Perry 1, Beth Mooney 8) Mooney isn\u2019t mucking around, she doesn\u2019t want to take too long to settle here. She starts this over with a confident straight drive for four against Jensen and follows it up with a two. These two are very good athletes and well matched in speed, so they will take the extra runs whenever they see them on offer. Jensen takes a breath and tightens it back up after some looser deliveries to start, but then gives away two wides just as she\u2019s finding her form again. She finishes with a dot after all that.     11.07pm    16th over: Australia 57-3 (Ellyse Perry 1, Beth Mooney 1) A brilliant start from Tahuhu to this over with the Haynes wicket first ball to bring Mooney to the crease. NZ now have the benefit of bowling at two new batters and unsettling them before they have a chance to find their feet out here. Of course that is no easy task against two of the world\u2019s best batters in Perry and Mooney, but NZ will take any win they can against the world number one. It\u2019s a great over from NZ, with only one run from it.     11.04pm   WICKET! Rachael Haynes 30 b Tahuhu, Australia 56-3  A sensational ball from Tahuhu nips back in at the stumps and there\u2019s very little Haynes can do but watch as her stumps crumble behind her.  Updated at 1.28am GMT    11.03pm    15th over: Australia 56-2 (Ellyse Perry 1, Rachael Haynes 30) Jensen starts with a couple of dots and Lanning is getting impatient. A wild swing on the third ball sends her on her way and brings Ellyse Perry to the crease. Jensen doesn\u2019t give Perry much to work with to start her innings, continuing with her frustrating line and length, but Perry and Haynes are able to rotate the strike for the last couple of balls.  Updated at 11.08pm GMT    10.59pm   WICKET! Meg Lanning 5 c Martin b Jensen, Australia 54-2  The White Ferns are doing a brilliant job in their plan to frustrate the batters. Jensen had been so consistent after her less than perfect start and tempted Lanning to swing at one outside off stump and send a top edge to Martin.     10.56pm    14th over: Australia 54-1 (Meg Lanning 5, Rachael Haynes 29) A bit of a wild looking delivery from Tahuhu to start the over, but Haynes can\u2019t quite get hold of it and it doesn\u2019t get past the fielders. But Tahuhu drops the next one in short and Haynes is ready, pulling it confidently to the boundary for four. She takes a single from the next ball and Tahuhu finds her length a bit more easily to Lanning, who plays out a dot and then rotates the strike back to Haynes, who finishes the over with yet another pull shot for four.     10.52pm    13th over: Australia 44-1 (Meg Lanning 4, Rachael Haynes 20) Jensen starts with another good length ball, but loses control of the second to send it for a wide that is nicely cleaned up by Martin. She finds her line and length again and cramps Haynes up, not giving her any opportunity to get the ball past the field. Finally she gets her opportunity on the last ball of the over, but it\u2019s just a single.     10.47pm    12th over: Australia 42-1 (Meg Lanning 4, Rachael Haynes 19) Mackay gets a rest after her big wicket and Lea Tahuhu comes in with two slips in play in an attacking field. Lannintg drives one down through deep extra cover for two and follows up with a single. She seems determined not to take too long to get into her innings and put herself in the position Healy found herself in where she felt the need to go big to speed up the run rate.      10.43pm    11th over: Australia 38-1 (Meg Lanning 1, Rachael Haynes 18) Jensen continues and starts with five dots to the Australian captain. Jensen has settled into her line and length a bit better now and is getting her field in better position as well. At last Lanning finds one that she likes and sneaks it past the field for a single.     10.40pm    10th over: Australia 37-1 (Meg Lanning 0, Rachael Haynes 18) The Australians start with a very quick single, followed by a dot and then another very quick single. They look like they\u2019re getting into their groove now, but Healy tries to go too big too soon and gives away her wicket. Lanning comes to the crease and aims to steady the ship.     10.39pm   WICKET! Alyssa Healy 15 c A Kerr b Mackay, Australia 37-1  A mis-timed slog from Healy proves her downfall and she sends an easy catch to Amelia Kerr at deep mid-wicket.     10.36pm    9th over: Australia 35-0 (Alyssa Healy 14, Rachael Haynes 17) Hayley Jensen comes in to bowl now and starts with a wide, but isn\u2019t deterred. Her next delivery is still a little leg side-ish but Haynes just takes a single from it and gives Jensen a look at Healy. Healy plays out a couple of dots to get her eye in and then flicks a ball to fine leg for a single. Jensen gives away a no ball late in the over and offers up a free hit to Haynes, but her line and length are good enough that she\u2019s not punished for it. However the very next ball Haynes opens up with a lovely pull shot that is misfielded by Rowe and goes over the boundary for four.     10.31pm    8th over: Australia 27-0 (Alyssa Healy 13, Rachael Haynes 12) Frankie Mackay comes into the attack now and Haynes immediately gets her away for a single. Healy plays her more cautiously, feeling her way in with the new bowler and plays out five dots.     10.27pm    7th over: Australia 26-0 (Alyssa Healy 13, Rachael Haynes 11) Jess Kerr starts the over with a wide - the first of the match - but doesn\u2019t let the over get away from her and gets straight back into her in-swinging, full deliveries that have proved so hard to score from. Haynes looks to be in an attacking mindset, always looking for runs as soon as she makes contact with the ball, but Kerr ensures they\u2019re hard to come by. Healy finishes the over with a confident boundary from a front foot flick over fine leg.     10.23pm    6th over: Australia 20-0 (Alyssa Healy 9, Rachael Haynes 10) Healy finds a bit more space against Rowe immediately and picks up three runs to start the over and Haynes follows it up with with a nicely timed drive to almost make it to the boundary, but some superb fielding from NZ keeps it to two runs. Rowe has been a bit loose with her early deliveries, but she pulls her line back late in the over with three dots to finish.     10.18pm    5th over: Australia 14-0 (Alyssa Healy 6, Rachael Haynes 8) Jess Kerr is finding some beautiful length this over and Haynes is doing her best to dig the ball out, but hasn\u2019t been able to get it past the field early in the over. Kerr maintains her line and length and finishes with a valuable maiden.     10.15pm    4th over: Australia 14-0 (Alyssa Healy 6, Rachael Haynes 8) Close to a wicket from the first ball of this over from Rowe as Healy flirts with a ball outside off, but misses edging it to the keeper. She plays out one more dot ball, before two quick singles for each of the batters to keep the strike rotating. It\u2019s a nice, tight over from Rowe, but NZ will be looking to take a wicket soon and not let these two settle into the game.     10.11pm    3rd over: Australia 12-0 (Alyssa Healy 5, Rachael Haynes 7) Jess Kerr continues and Healy starts with a confident stroke, but it can\u2019t beat the field. Katey Martin comes up to the stumps to try to cramp Healy up a bit, but it doesn\u2019t pay off and she immediately opens her scoring with a boundary past long on. It\u2019s an interesting battle between the two teams so far - still plenty of dot balls, but Healy and Haynes are making sure to not the let the pressure build too much with regular scoring.     10.07pm    2nd over: Australia 7-0 (Alyssa Healy 0, Rachael Haynes 7) Hannah Rowe opens from the other end and her first ball is a bit too straight and Haynes flicks it past fine leg for the first boundary of the match. Rowe tightens it up and pulls back the scoring with five dots - a very similar pattern to the previous over.      10.04pm    1st over: Australia 3-0 (Alyssa Healy 0, Rachael Haynes 3) Jess Kerr opening the bowling for NZ, with the breeze behind her. A good start from Haynes and aggressive running right from the start to get off the mark with three. Healy is more guarded and cautious against the in-swing of Kerr, playing out five dots to start her innings.      9.48pm    A very interesting line up from Australia, who have gone with their two leg spinners in Alana King and Amanda-Jade Wellington for this one. This means Jess Jonassen misses out, but Ash Gardner has returned from Covid isolation to add some off spin to the attack. On the batting side of things, Australia will be hoping for a repeat performance from Alyssa Healy who scored an impressive 72 against Pakistan. Australia bat deep, with even King at eight capable of smashing some quick runs. So they will be looking to put on a big score in this first innings and take the game out of New Zealand\u2019s reach before they even pick up their bats.     9.39pm   New Zealand XI   Sophie Devine (c) Suzie Bates Amelia Kerr Amy Satterthwaite Maddy Green Frances Mackay Katey Martin (wk) Hayley Jensen Lea Tahuhu Jess Kerr Hannah Rowe      9.38pm   Australia XI  Alyssa Healy (wk) Rachael Haynes Meg Lanning (c) Ellyse Perry Beth Mooney Tahlia McGrath Ashleigh Gardner Alana King Amanda-Jade Wellington Megan Schutt Darcie Brown      9.37pm   New Zealand win the toss  New Zealand have won the toss and chosen to bowl. No surprises there, if you win the toss against Meg Lanning, you make her do what she\u2019s not comfortable with.      9.35pm   Preamble  Good morning everyone! It\u2019s been a fascinating World Cup so far, so many twists in the tale and fascinating finishes. The West Indies have been the surprise packet in the early rounds, however a heavy loss to India - who look to be finding their form at last - will hurt. England are in some serious trouble after starting with two straight losses and will need to get back on their feet very quickly. But today we have a classic Trans-Tasman battle between these two old foes - Australia and New Zealand. The warm up game the two teams played revealed some weaknesses in Australia, with the inability to take wickets proving their undoing. New Zealand started the tournament with a shock loss to the West Indies but have bounced back since then with two strong wins over Bangaldesh and India. It should be an incredible game today, so let\u2019s get into it!  "

Hope Saturday/Sunday\u2019s final is just as thrilling. England, the reigning World Champions, on a roll after a dog\u2019s breakfast of a start to the tournament, to play the unbeaten, imperious Aussies. We\u2019ll be here - hope you will too. Thanks for all the messages, have a lovely day/night!     8.47am    No team has previously ever lost two games and made the final - England, remember, lost three. A relieved and happy looking Heather Knight takes to the microphone, \u201cI\u2019m really pleased. It was a complete performance today. The girls brought their best cricket when all was on the line. Really chuffed and excited for Sunday. Wyatt was outstanding and really selective with the balls she attacked, she didn\u2019t get bogged down that she was picking the fielders.\u201d Wyatt: Dunkley: Ecclestone. What a trio!  Updated at 8.59am BST    8.41am    The South African captain Sune Luus: \u201cEngland played a brilliant performance today. I just think we needed to be clinical today and we weren\u2019t, but we still had a great campaign this World Cup and we\u2019re not taking anything away from that. In those crunch moments we\u2019ve done extrememely well to get over the line.\u201d     8.39am    So England will play Australia at Christchurch on 3rd April in the World Cup Final - 10pm start on Saturday, BST. It is the first time the two teams have met in a women\u2019s final since 1988. The Aussies will have to be favourites, but if England play like this... and with Ecclestone bowling as she is... \u201cHi again from Wellington, Tanya!\u201d Good <strike> morning </strike> evening Ed Kay. \u201cI was disappointed to not be able to watch the England ladies live at the Basin yesterday but more than happy to trade that for tonight\u2019s performance. \u201cLet\u2019s hope we can put it all together for one last game and give the Aussies a run for their money on Sunday. A tight final would be an appropriate way to see our such a great tournament.\u201d Too right - it\u2019s been a humdinger.      8.35am    Danni Wyatt is holding onto her player of the match award for her scintillating hundred as the players shake hands, South Africa anorak clad. A sad end for what was a wonderful tournament for them.  I hope you did !     8.32am   WICKET! Chetty st Jones b Ecclestone 21 (South Africa 156 all out - England win by 137 runs  Six-fer! Chetty charges, flails, misses and Jones swoops off the bails! England are through to their sixth final after starting the tournament with a hat-trick of losses, the wheels, doors and exhaust pipe bumping down the road     8.29am   WICKET! Klass c Beaumont b Ecclestone 3 (South Africa 152-9)  Ecclestone gets her five-fer! The pressure is on Beaumont, but she makes no mistake, getting down on one knee to take an easy catch at point     8.27am    37th over: South Africa 152-8 ( Chetty 17, Klass 3) A fistful of singles off Dean.     8.23am    36th over: South Africa 148-8 ( Chetty 16, Klass 0) Too good, too good! Ecclestone now has 4-32- can she get that first international five-fer? It\u2019s nearly hers as she beats Klass with a couple of peaches.   Updated at 8.26am BST    8.21am   WICKET! Ismail c Ecclestone 12 (South Africa 148-8)  Dean gets a catch at last, getting a huge hug from Anya Shrubsole in the process, as Ismail swings to mid-off as her luck runs out at last.      8.19am    35th over: South Africa 147-7 ( Chetty 15, Ismail 12) Ismail on the charge again, cracking Dean through the covers for another four, before getting a leading edge which the sprawling Dean can\u2019t reach in her follow through. Then Ismail swings, misses and... is that a missed stumping? Anyway, the ball flies down to the rope for four leg byes.  Updated at 8.26am BST    8.15am    34th over: South Africa 135-7 ( Chetty 12, Ismail 7) England appeal for a run-out - just because they can - but its not out. Ismail hasn\u2019t give up, smashing Ecclestone through the covers with stylish panache.  Updated at 8.26am BST    8.12am    33rd over: South Africa 127-7 ( Chetty 11, Ismail 0) They pause for drinks: to toast the last rites. My hot water bottle has gone cold. \u201cNot wanting to count chickens early, but\u201d....writes Phil Cavanagh, \u201cLooks like the Proteas forgot to beware the wounded lion(esses). \u201cThe final looks to be a contest between the \u2018auld enemies\u2019.\u201d I think you\u2019re right! Dean gets some bowling practise in - though that\u2019s another wide.      8.05am    32nd over: South Africa 124-7 ( Chetty 10, Ismail 0) Wides are South Africa\u2019s only friend at the moment, as one from Ecclestone flies wide of Jones and almost down to the rope.     8.02am    31st over: South Africa 117-7 ( Chetty 6, Ismail 0) Seven from the over as Dean slips out a couple of wides.     8.01am    30th over: South Africa 110-6 ( Chetty 1) du Preez slaps Ecclestone for a meaty four before getting down on her knees for a mis-judged sweep. Ecclestone now has 17 wickets in the World Cup - the most ever by an England female cricketer.      7.58am   WICKET! du Preez b Ecclestone 30 (South Africa 110-7)   Not the best shot du Preez will ever play, trying to sweep from middle, comprehensively misses. Deceived in the flight.     7.54am    29th over: South Africa 104-6 (du Preez 25, Chetty 0) Dean loops through another, du Preez surviving a slice that falls just short of backward point.     7.52am    28th over: South Africa 101-6 (du Preez 22, Chetty 0) A second for Ecclestone, the ball after Heather Knight is convinced by an elongated appeal off an arm ball - which is very much not out after missing the pad altogether. South Africa slip-sliding to defeat here.      7.50am   WICKET Tyron c Sciver b Ecclestone 3 (South Africa 101-6)   Tries to turn Ecclestone off her ankles and Sciver takes another smart catch at mid-wicket     7.46am    27th over: South Africa 100-5 (du Preez 21, Tyron 3) The South African hundred comes up with a whimper and a Charlie Dean wide.     7.43am    26th over: South Africa 97-5 (du Preez 21, Tyron 1) Beautiful from Ecclestone - I can\u2019t see South Africa coming back from this now. Kapp is their talismanic hitter.  \u201cHello Tanya,\u201d. Hello Arthur Graves in a very damp Sydney! \u201cMight it be possible to see the scorecard too?\u201dAh - let me see if I can fix it.      7.40am   WICKET! Kapp b Ecclestone 21 (South Africa 96-5)  Ecclestone throws it large, Kapp has a swing, misses, and the ball plumps into middle stump.     7.39am    25th over: South Africa 95-4 (du Preez 20, Kapp 21) At the half way stage, South Africa need another 199 runs. Kapp is brought out a pencilled note, and a drink: whatever was on it made her laugh.      7.36am    24th over: South Africa 92-4 (du Preez 18, Kapp 20) It\u2019s Ecclestone time! She intimidates with every inch of her six foot frame, despite her smiles. But what is this? Kapp leans onto the back foot and cuts her for four.  Updated at 7.37am BST    7.34am    23rd over: South Africa 86-4 (du Preez 17, Kapp 15) Tidy from Dean, she\u2019s got such a great temperament, doesn\u2019t let a few mistakes in the field get to her. \u201cJetlagged at 1:30 am here but such a privilege to watch this all round excellence and camaraderie from the England side . Thanks for the commentary, as always.\u201d A pleasure Ed Mackereth - where are you and where have you been?!  Updated at 7.37am BST    7.30am    22nd over: South Africa 81-4 (du Preez 16, Kapp 11) Kapp has had enough poking about and crashes Cross for four down the ground. Then pancakes one the air where the ball swirls about and Dean at mid-on, trying to follow its path, can\u2019t get a finger on the ball and it falls safely to the ground.      7.27am    21st over: South Africa 74-4 (du Preez 16, Kapp 4) Slow and tight from Charlie Dean and South Africa can\u2019t break the shackles.      7.25am    20th over: South Africa 72-4 (du Preez 15, Kapp 3) Cross is tidy, South Africa do some casual pruning. On the boundary Lisa Keighley makes urgent notes with a pencil.   This is interesting - and true I think. After all the Burns-Hartley stuff last (?) year. Not than anyone has to support anyone else - but it had all gone very quiet.  Updated at 7.26am BST    7.19am    19th over: South Africa 70-4 (du Preez 14, Kapp 2) Knight turns to Charlie Dean, and she makes a breakthrough with her third ball! She\u2019s got a golden arm, this girl.      7.17am   WICKET! Goodall b Dean 29 (South Africa 67-4)   Attempts to paddle sweep but misses, shuffles too far across the stumps, and is unceremoniously bowled     7.14am    18th over: South Africa 66-3 (Goodall 29, du Preez 12) The current run rate 3.71, the required run-rate 7.05. South Africa have been brilliant in this competition, but I\u2019m just not sure where the runs are going to come from. Cross is characteristically neat and tidy again, pinning Goodall to the stumps with her last ball.     7.10am    17th over: South Africa 65-3 (Goodall 29, du Preez 11) Sciver resumes, bowling in a short sleeved jumper, South Africa can only squeeze two from the over; and they\u2019ve got ten overs of Ecclestone to get through.      7.08am    16th over: South Africa 63-3 (Goodall 28, du Preez 10) It looks like it is getting a bit chilly out there at the Hagley Oval, the jumpers are on in the crowd. A nice diving stop by Wyatt to cut off a cut by du Preez. They stop for DRINKS, with the run rate creeping up towards seven an over.     7.02am    15th over: South Africa 61-3 (Goodall 27, du Preez 9) Five from Sciver\u2019s over.      7.00am    14th over: South Africa 56-3 (Goodall 24, du Preez 7) du Preez reaches the boundary with a thick edge off Cross that just beats Sophie Ecclestone who ends up splodged on the ground. Some kids are having an absolute ball sliding down the World Cup sign embedded in the grass in a deconstructed cardboard box. As cricket should be.  Shout out from this end too!     6.56am    13th over: South Africa 48-3 (Goodall 23, du Preez 1) Goodall continues to pinch and poke. An email! It\u2019s from my brother in law Chris in Sedona-Arizona. \u201cGrandad says we should win it with the runs we have on the board. Only we just found out he has Covid. Does that count as potentially clouded judgment?\u201d He\u2019s a pretty wise old owl, I think he\u2019s still got it. And get well soon!     6.51am    12th over: South Africa 44-3 (Goodall 18) Cross breaks through in her first over, and burst into a grin of delight, fiddling with her hair bobble as she always does. The seam of the white balls spins and twists in the slo-mo replay and that\u2019s such an important wicket to get rid of the South African captain. In Manchester, it has started snowing.   Updated at 6.54am BST    6.48am   WICKET! Luus b Cross 21 (South Africa 44-3)   Beautiful from Cross! One that nips back and skittles through the gate as Luus shapes to drive.      6.46am    11th over: South Africa 41-2 (Goodall 18, Luus 20) Ooof, top-edge by Luus off Sciver that flies just wide of mid-wicket, then Goodall runs without urgency and is only just in as the third umpires checks for a run out.      6.42am    10th over: South Africa 37-2 (Goodall 18, Luus 16)  An over of plenty for South Africa. Luus plumps her front foot and swings for four,. a couple more through the covers, then four more behind square. Eleven from it. And during that over England completed their 2000th ball in this World Cup without overstepping - a somewhat mind-boggling stat. Fantastic discipline.     6.36am    9th over: South Africa 26-2 (Goodall 18, Luus 5) Time for Sciver, and she\u2019s tidy. And she\u2019s more than that, as she beats Goodall\u2019s bat twice, and then powers the ball to mid-wicket where Charlie Dean mistimes her jump and drops a rocket.      6.34am    8th over: South Africa 25-2 (Goodall 18, Luus 4) South Africa suddenly playing with a little more zig-a-zig-ah. Goodall unveils an eggs-over-easy flick over midwicket that even makes Anya Shrubsole pull a face in appreciation.      6.29am    7th over: South Africa 20-2 (Goodall 14, Luus 3) Gorgeous shot from Goodall, as she pounces on a short one from Brunt and sends it spinning to the boundary. The last ball is a short one too, and Goodall repeats the shot, with the same result      6.26am    6th over: South Africa 12-2 (Goodall 6, Luus 3) Shrubsole has the ball boomeranging: Luus drives, a leading edge, and it flies, jauntily, riskily, over point.      6.24am    5th over: South Africa 8-2 (Goodall 5, Luus 0) Brunt completes another over, another maiden, South Africa still haven\u2019t managed to squeeze a run off her today. Goodall hits Brunt back over her head, Brunt leaps and the ball brushes her hands - before falling to the ground. A chance - a tricky one - but a chance. Brunt glares.      6.21am    4th over: South Africa 8-2 (Goodall 5) Is that it? Is it already over? With both South Africa\u2019s openers back contemplating their ankles, it must be likely. Lee will be disappointed with that nothing shot. And Shrubsole strikes again!     6.18am   WICKET! Lee c Sciver b Shrubsole 2 (South Africa 8-2)  Snaffled at midwicket! Sciver swoops with both hands as Lee flicks the ball straight to her to continue her down-beat tournament.     6.16am    3rd over: South Africa 5-1 (Lee 0; Goodall 4) Brunt produces an absolute beauty which somehow skims the top of off stump, by the skin of a custard, as Lee boldly leaves one that nips in. A maiden.      6.14am    2nd over: South Africa 5-1 (Lee 0; Goodall 4) Fab from Shrubsole, who time and again, when you think it might be time for her to hang up her boots, produces the goods. Such an important wicket that for England. Goodall off the mark with a boundary as Shrubsole drifts legside.  If you\u2019re munching in your cornflakes in the UK, sunning yourself on the gorgeous grassy banks of the Hagley over, or anywhere in between, do drop me a line     6.08am   WICKET!  Wolvaardt c and b Shrubsole 0 (South Africa 1-0)   Gone! The tournament\u2019s leading run-scorer trudges off, nose down, bat held horizontally, as Shrubsole pulls off an athletic bit of work, plucking the grape from the vine as Wolvaardt lollops back a return catch.      6.04am    1st over: South Africa 1-0 (Lee 0; Wolvaardt 0) Lizelle Lee blocks Katherine Brunt\u2019s first ball, the two old warhorses ready for battle. She blocks the second as the TV flashes up a win predictor of 84 per cent for England. And the third, the fourth, the sixth and the last. A solitary run comes from a wide.     5.59am   South Africa need 294 to win at 5.88 an over!  And here they come!     5.58am    Incidentally, Wyatt was dropped FIVE times!  Ismail was the pick of the bowlers (3-46), well back up by Marizanne Kapp (2-52) and Klass (2-55), though they were clobbered a bit towards the end. Some stats on the bowling attacks: England rely heavily on their spinners.      5.48am    Thanks James, you\u2019re a star for taking the night shift. It is indeed chilly in Manchester, the cars frosted and blossoms browned. England, however, were red hot! What an amazing century by Danni Wyatt, and classy innings by Sophia Dunkley and last-gasp hitting by Sophie Ecclestone. England will back themselves here - it should be more than enough on a cracking pitch.   Updated at 5.54am BST    5.42am    England have given themselves every chance of making the World Cup Final. But beware South Africa, they love to get stuck into a run chase.  With that I\u2019m going to hand over to Tanya Aldred who is up with the lark in what I presume is a chilly Manchester, she\u2019ll take you through the second half of this absorbing game. Good morning and Goodnight!     5.35am         5.33am   England finish on 293-8  Ecclestone helps a slower ball round the corner for four! And a top edge goes for four more! And another! Three in a row for Ecclestone! Pitched up and clobbered down the ground. Ismail follows up with a yorker. Dot ball. Last ball of the innings... Ecclestone backs away and is bowled. What a cameo though, Ecclestone scored 24 off just 11 balls.  South Africa will need a World Cup record chase of 294 runs to win and make the final.      5.28am   Wicket! Dunkley ct Lee b Ismail (England 281-7)  Dunkley goes off the first ball from Ismail. Caught at mid on. Her teammates stand to applaud her, they know just how important that innings could be.      5.26am    48th over: England 281-6 (Dunkley 60, Ecclestone 12 ) Two singles off Khaka. Dunkley then drives for four! She keeps strike for the last with a single off the final ball.      5.24am    48th over: England 276-6 (Dunkley 54, Ecclestone 11 ) Kapp to bowl her last. Three singles into the deep. Dunkley drives but it hits the stumps at the other end. Another single. Ecclestone drives straight for four! Then sweeps for four! 12 runs off the over. Two to go. Every run crucial as South Africa love to chase, there don\u2019t look to be many demons in this pitch.   Updated at 5.47am BST    5.18am    47th over: England 262-6 (Dunkley 52, Ecclestone 1) Sophie Ecclestone at the crease and off the mark straight away with a single to fine leg. Three overs to go. South Africa just pegging England back a bit here.    Updated at 5.19am BST    5.17am   Wicket! Brunt b Klaas 9 (England 261-6)  Bowled by the sloooowest of slow balls.      5.14am    46th over: England 256-5 (Dunkley 50, Brunt 6)Dunkley unfurls a lovely back foot punch to go to 49. A single down the ground brings up fifty! Her third in ODIs and her second of this World Cup. Cool, calm, and classy. Well batted Sophia Dunkley. Brunt goes deep in the crease and crunches a drive away through the lengthening shadows for four! She then gives a pull shot some real welly and it is clawed in on the deep boundary.      5.10am    45th over: England 247-5 (Dunkley 47, Brunt 0) Katherine Brunt is the new batter. Khaka greets her with a full ball that misses everything and rolls away for four byes!      5.07am   Wicket! Wyatt ct Lee b Klaas 129 (England 242-5)  Wyatt goes for a brilliant 129. Caught at short third by Lizelle Lee. The South African players offer handshakes and back pats. A lovely moment. A great knock.      5.04am    44th over: England 242-4 (Wyatt 129 , Dunkley 46) Dunkley is opening the shoulders too, swivel-pulling into the wind but the ball evades the sprawling fielders. England continue on their merry way with cuts, sweeps, drives and pulls. South Africa simply unable to stem the flow. The score predictor flashes up 310...     5.00am    43rd over: England 237-4 (Wyatt 127 , Dunkley 43) Wyatt goes over the covers for another boundary! She\u2019s playing a shot a ball now. Sweeping Khaka for a couple and driving for a single. Dunkley then sets about the bowling and England take 11 from the over. Seven to go - all English eyes on the 300. England have six wickets in hand and Wyatt is on the charge.   Updated at 5.04am BST    4.56am    42nd over: England 226-4 (Wyatt 119, Dunkley 41) Ismail scons Dunkley with a quick bouncer. Dunkley grimaces but shrugs it off. A glance into the leg side brings up the hundred partnership for Wyatt and Dunkley! This pair have been outstanding, giving England a toe in the final.   Updated at 4.58am BST    4.53am    41st over: England 223-4 (Wyatt 118, Dunkley 39)Drop! Ismail juggles Wyatt on the boundary and the ball is grassed at the third attempt. The camera cuts to a grinning Heather Knight. Drop again! Wyatt again! A much harder chance, but a diving chance in the covers. The over still yields 5 runs for England in and \u2018mongst the butterfingers.      4.49am    40th over: England 218-4 (Wyatt 116, Dunkley 36) Kapp into her 8th over. She starts with a wide ball for length. The runs are flowing though, Wyatt and Dunkley middling everything and scampering runs with ease. Nine runs coming from the over. Ten overs to go.      4.43am         4.43am    39th over: England 209-4 (Wyatt 109, Dunkley 35) England pick up five singles off Tryon.       4.41am    38th over: England 204-4 (Wyatt 106, Dunkley 34) Kapp back into the attack with South Africa getting desperate for a wicket. Wyatt drives her up and over the infield for four to bring up England\u2019s 200!     4.38am   Century for Danni Wyatt!  Dunkley nudges a single to bring Wyatt on to strike. Deep breath. 99... and DOT. Cut to the fielder. BUT THERE IT IS! 100 for Wyatt! A top knock in a pressure match. She\u2019s been aggressive but also saw off some top bowling early on. A bit of luck along the way with the dropped catches but a fantastic century! Well batted Danni Wyatt.  37th over: England 198-4 (Wyatt 101, Dunkley 32)     4.31am    36th over: England 188-4 (Wyatt 99, Dunkley 29) Wafty drive from Dunkley that flies away over the vacant slips for a couple. A single brings Wyatt onto strike. Can she make it to three figures? A pull for four takes her to 99! Two dots to end the over... she\u2019ll have to wait a smidge longer.      4.28am    35th over: England 180-4 (Wyatt 95, Dunkley 26) Khaka into her 7th over. Dunkley mis-times a drive for a single to mid-on. Slap! Wyatt moves into the 90s with a brutal pull off a full bunger. She loves pace on the ball. Especially if it\u2019s a full toss. Another four! Wyatt hoicks a short one for another boundary to the square leg fence! Fifty partnership up too. Solid platform this for England with 15 to go.      4.24am    34th over: England 171-4 (Wyatt 87, Dunkley 25) Four singles... and then Wyatt laces a drive but straight to Captain Luus at cover, who gives her hands a shake afterwards.      4.21am    33rd over: England 167-4 (Wyatt 85, Dunkley 23) Gem of an innings again from Dunkley, she sweeps Tryon for four! The spinner has gone for 55 from her 8 overs. England rotate for three singles too.      4.18am    32nd over: England 160-4 (Wyatt 83, Dunkley 18) Klaas keeps Dunkley honest and reels off the first maiden of the match. Keep an eye on how many Ecclestone and Cross stitch together later on... England have been going at 5 runs an over.      4.14am    31st over: England 160-4 (Wyatt 83, Dunkley 18)Wyatt is put down by Goodall on the square leg boundary, the ball bursting through her hands and going for four! Wyatt living by the sword and still alive. Four singles and a two make it ten for the over.      4.10am    30th over: England 150-4 (Wyatt 75, Dunkley 16) Ismail back into the fold for her 7th over, a sure sign that South Africa want to break this crucial partnership. A single each to Dunkley and Wyatt. The umpire calls a short ball a wide much to the bowler\u2019s chagrin. 20 overs to go, what will England be happy with? What will South Africa be happy with? Should I know the answers to these questions?    Updated at 4.11am BST    4.06am     29th over: England 147-4 (Wyatt 74, Dunkley 15) Five off the over, Wyatt and Dunkley communicating well and picking up singles and twos. And time for a slurp. Drinks. Imma gonna plump for a Horlicks. Other malty/milky drinks are available.  An email! entitled \u20184AM\u2019 from Rosanna Lynch:  \u201cWho\u2019s tuning in through the night? Me and the cat, both vying for control of the sofa... thanks for the OBO keeping us company.\u201d Top effort Rosanna and cat!      4.01am    28th over: England 142-4 (Wyatt 73, Dunkley 11) Wyatt glances fine for a couple and then drives for a single. Dunkley pulls off the front foot for four! The ball making a satisfying thwock! as it hits the blade. The final ball is driven to mid on for a single. Good stuff from England.      3.56am    27th over: England 134-4 (Wyatt 70, Dunkley 6) Wyatt continues to play attacking shots, a flat bat shot back past the bowler only brings her one. Dunkley then is down on her haunches and paddles the spinner for a couple, she then rocks back and crisply drives for four! Shot!     3.53am    26th over: England 125-4 (Wyatt 69, Dunkley 0) Sophia Dunkley arrives at the crease. She\u2019s been Mrs Consistent so far in the tournament. England need her to build another partnership with Wyatt here.      3.51am   Wicket! Jones ct Tryon b Kapp 28 (England 126-4)  Kapp breaks the partnership and bellows a full throated roar into the Christchurch breeze! Amy Jones hurried up by a short ball and caught at mid-wicket.      3.48am    25th over: England 121-3 (Wyatt 64, Jones 28) This is riveting cricket, befitting a World Cup semi final. Half way through the innings and both teams going toe to toe. England take 8 runs from Klaas, Wyatt bunting down the ground and slicing through point. Jones chipping into the leg side for a couple. This feels like a crucial passage of play, both sides vying to get on top.      3.45am    24th over: England 113-3 (Wyatt 59, Jones 25) Amy Jones scorches a drive away across the carpet. Four runs. She has made a very perky 25 runs here, taking the pressure off Wyatt too.      3.43am    23rd over: England 108-3 (Wyatt 59, Jones 20) Four runs off Klaas\u2019s latest. Decent partnership building between these two batters. And no that isn\u2019t a jinx.      3.41am    22nd over: England 104-3 (Wyatt 58, Jones 17) 100 up for England. Amy Jones bookends the over with boundaries. The first is a lovely cover drive, the second a meaty edge through the vacant slip region that rolls away for four. The clock creeps towards 4am here in England. Any die-hard fans out there tuning in through the night? Time it was, and what a time it was, it was.       3.35am    21st over: England 96-3 (Wyatt 58, Jones 9) Tryon whirls away, Wyatt rides her luck, a clubbed shot landing just wide of mid-on! England still take seven from the over, a combination of paddles and pushed drives.      3.28am    20th over: England 89-3 (Wyatt 55, Jones 5) Ismail is taken out of the attack after getting the breakthrough, the skipper keeping 4 overs from her up her green sleeve. Khaka is back for her fourth over and England take three singles form it. Twenty overs done. Anyone\u2019s game at the moment.      3.24am    19th over: England 86-3 (Wyatt 54, Jones 3) Fifty for Danii Wyatt! off 56 balls. Her second of the tournament. She\u2019s found form at the business end. She paddle sweeps Tryon for a scampered three and Amy Jones is into her work too.      3.21am    18th over: England 79-3 (Wyatt 48, Jones 1) Ismail bowls a fast bouncer to Amy Jones first up! The bowler has got her dander up here, the ball to dismiss Sciver hurried the batter for pace and she wasn\u2019t able to keep it down. This game is waiting for someone to put their name on it.      3.18am   Wicket! Sciver ct Kapp b Ismail 15 (England 77-3)  Sciver gets a pull shot too high on the bat and is pouched by Kapp at square leg! Big wicket for South Africa!   Updated at 3.18am BST    3.17am    17th over: England 77-2 (Wyatt 48, Sciver 15) More rotation from England, they are happy to pick up singles.      3.15am    16th over: England 71-2 (Wyatt 44, Sciver 13) Ismail back into the attack for her fifth over. Sciver glides away for a single. Wyatt gets an inside edge to fine leg and they come back for two. Wyatt then pushes a single into the covers. Nice from Wyatt, she\u2019s not all crash, bang, whallop. Intelligent batting. England need a big score from her.      3.09am    15th over: England 67-2 (Wyatt 41, Sciver 12) Spin for the first time as Chloe Tryon comes on for a twirl. Sciver whips a full ball off her toes for a couple. Then leans back to cut a shorter delivery for a single. She has been very busy so far. Wyatt joins in with a nudge off her pads for a couple. Risk free cricket from England.      3.06am    14th over: England 62-2 (Wyatt 39, Sciver 9) TV replays are showing Nat Sciver\u2019s weird dismissal from the group stages when the two sides played before. Remember the ball looping off the back of her bat and hip? She\u2019ll be very keen to avenge that moment of misfortune here. That\u2019ll help! A short ball is nailed for four by Sciver, a rasping pull shot. England rotate well, ten from the over.      3.01am    13th over: England 52-2 (Wyatt 37, Sciver 1) Khaka finishes off her over, Sciver jabs down on a full ball to pick up a quick single.       2.59am    Drinks. Knight was becalmed at the crease. The South African seamers bowled tight lines to her and she couldn\u2019t rotate strike or pierce the infield. Nat Sciver is the new batter. The game on a knife-edge.      2.57am   Wicket! Knight lbw b Khaka 1 (England 51-2)  Pinned in front and Knight has to go! Three reds in the review and South Africa pick up their second.      2.54am    12th over: England 50-1 (Wyatt 37, Knight 1) Shot! Wyatt launches Klaas away up and over extra cover for another boundary. DROP! Wow. Wyatt plinks a pull high on the bat and into the breeze, Marizanne Kapp diving but the ball goes through her. A bad miss on the replay. Fifty up for England too. The sun is out and shining on Danni Wyatt at the moment.      2.50am    11th over: England 45-1 (Wyatt 32, Knight 1) Khaka sends down five dots. Good cricket this. Ebb and flow. Nip and tuck. Bat v ball. Green v Blue. Wyatt drives a single off the last ball.      2.47am    10th over: England 44-1 (Wyatt 31, Knight 1) Drop! Lizelle Lee grasses one at wide slip! Wyatt pokes at a length ball from new bowler Masabata Klaas but the chance goes begging. Wyatt then rubs a big dollop of sodium chloride in the wound by crunching a cover drive for four! Don\u2019t run for that! Wyatt has looked very aggressive and moves into the thirties. Heather Knight still languishes on one run from 16 balls. She won\u2019t be too fussed though with Wyatt at the other end keeping things moving. PowerPlay done.      2.41am    9th over: England 35-1 (Wyatt 22, Knight 1)Ayabonga Khaka is on in place of Ismail and she struggles with her line first up, Wyatt cuts her away for back to back boundaries! An outside edge brings two more and a quick single brings Knight on to strike. REVIEW for LBW! Nip backer pins Knight on the pad but it looks a smidge high. Not out on the field... and stays that way - the impact was outside the line. South Africa lose a review. 12 off the over.      2.37am    8th over: England 23-1 (Wyatt 11, Knight 1)Wyatt is middling everything but straight to a fielder each time! Five dot balls and then a change of tack, she drops and runs to pinch the strike.      2.33am    7th over: England 22-1 (Wyatt 10, Knight 1)Wyatt cuts away in the air for four. England\u2019s second boundary. The pressure valve just hisses slightly. It was uppish but just out of reach from the diving point fielder. A wide and a single nudge England\u2019s score upward.     2.30am    6th over: England 16-1 (Wyatt 4, Knight 1) Wyatt gets off strike with a single to square leg. Kapp then keeps Knight honest, reeling off five dots in a row. HK has just 1 from 11 balls so far, but she\u2019s hanging tough against some probing seam bowling.      2.24am    5th over: England 15-1 (Wyatt 4, Knight 1)Wyatt scythes a cut shot away in the air but into the gap, just a single. Knight gets off the mark with a single. Ismail looks threatening, the breeze at her back.      2.19am    4th over: England 11-1 (Wyatt 2, Knight 0) Two slips in for Heather Knight. She watches Kapp sling one outside the off peg and then slip one down the leg-side for a wide.England remain the only side not to get a fifty opening stand in this tournament. Skipper Knight is at the crease early again.   Updated at 2.21am BST    2.16am   Wicket! Beaumont ct Chetty b Kapp 7 (England 10-1)  Gone! Beaumont takes a step down the wicket to Kapp but ends up wafting at a back of a length ball, getting a tickle and the keeper gladly snaffles. England lose their first.      2.14am    3rd over: England 10-0 (Beaumont 7, Wyatt 2) Beaumont and Wyatt look keen to get bat on ball, both a little guilty of losing their shape as they try and hit a tad too hard. Ismail bowls a tight and fast over, she pins Beaumont on the pad and there\u2019s a big appeal but the umpire says no dice. It would have been \u2018umpires call\u2019 if SA had reviewed... Five dots and a single off the last.      2.10am    2nd over: England 9-0 (Beaumont 6, Wyatt 2) Marizanne Kapp, England\u2019s tormentor in chief the last time the two sides met, is on to bowl her slingy seamers. She starts with a wide. Wyatt then cuts away for a single and Beaumont gets away with a weird looking poke that goes wide of point. Movement through the air from Kapp.      2.06am    1st over: England 6-0 (Beaumont 5, Wyatt 1) Tammy Beaumont drives the first ball of the match for four! A beauty first up. The outfield looks quick, the ball laced away to the fence. There\u2019s a couple of singles, Wyatt gets of the mark with a tickle to third man. Beaumont is then cloth\u2019d on the helmet with the final ball, she went to pull and missed, the short ball from Ismail clonking her right on the three lions badge. She\u2019s ok though. Game on.      2.00am    Here we go! Shabnim Ismail will have first use of the ball and here she comes to Tammy Beaumont. Danni Wyatt is at t\u2019other end. PLAY!      1.58am    The players belt out the anthems, there\u2019s dappled sunlight and a bit of a breeze in Christchurch. The pitch is biscuit-brown-ish in colour, I\u2019d say a malted milk. Word from the ground is there might be some assistance to the bowlers first up. Heather Knight admitted she would have bowled first. But England have the chance to get runs on the board.   Updated at 2.02am BST    1.55am    Congratulations to Sune Luus and Lizelle Lee and what an occasion for a 100th ODI!      1.53am    South Africa are unchanged:  South Africa: Lizelle Lee, Laura Wolvaardt, Lara Goodall, Sune Luus(c), Mignon du Preez, Marizanne Kapp, Chloe Tryon, Trisha Chetty(w), Shabnim Ismail, Masabata Klaas, Ayabonga Khaka      1.49am    One change for England - Anya Shrubsole comes back into the side in place of Freya Davies.      1.48am   South Africa win the toss...  They choose to bowl first     1.45am    Preamble Three\u2019s a crowd. Hello and welcome to this OBO of the second World Cup semi-final between England and South Africa from the Hagley Oval, Christchurch. Predictably, the Aussies boshed their way past West Indies in yesterday\u2019s match and they lie in wait for the victors today, looming yet dormant - like a big yella Dracula? Me either. It\u2019s late here in South London.  Today\u2019s day/nighter semi boasts the number one ODI batter \u2013 the Proteas\u2019 vulpine Laura Wolvaardt - lining up against the number one ODI bowler in Sophie Ecclestone, England\u2019s be-plaited spinning hero. The number crunchers at the ICC must be doing something right, Ecclestone sits at the top of the World Cup wickets column with 14 scalps and Wolvaardt is the tournament\u2019s leading run scorer with 433 runs. Only one can prosper today.  England have momentum after four wins on the bounce but South Africa the recent muscle-memory of victory, they ran out winners by three wickets, with four balls to spare, when the two teams squared up in the group stages, a defeat that left Knight and co peering into the World Cup abyss.  We\u2019ve been here before of course, England wobbled their way past South Africa in the semi-final at Bristol in 2017 on their way to lifting the trophy. Will history repeat or will South Africa take revenge? Let\u2019s find out!  As ever, do get in touch if you are tuning in, I\u2019d be glad of the company.  Play gets underway in 30 minutes time - 2pm local time, 2AM GMT and 12pm AEDT.   "

The United States team, which boasts Coco Gauff and Madison Keys, and the Czech Republic, led by Barbora Krejcikova and Karolina Pliskova, will begin the event as favourites. Britain have been drawn with Kazakhstan and Spain, with their first tie on Tuesday evening against a Kazakhstan team that boasts the Wimbledon champion, Elena Rybakina. They will attempt to reach the round robin stage without British No 1 Emma Raducanu, who withdrew due to a wrist injury. The squad is headed by singles players Harriet Dart, Boulter and Heather Watson, plus specialist doubles team Olivia Nicholls and Alicia Barnett. While Dart will be GB\u2019s No 1 player, it is Boulter who played a pivotal role in Britain\u2019s dramatic victory against Kazakhstan in the Copper Box in 2019 that secured promotion, winning one of the singles matches against Zarina Diyas. But it also came at a personal cost as she competed with a stress fracture in her back that took her months to recover from. \u201cIt\u2019s something that\u2019s in my core memory and I won\u2019t ever forget that one,\u201d said Boulter. \u201cSo I will hopefully use it and it was something that was pretty special to me. I think I can speak for everyone by saying it was something that was iconic, and I hope that we can replicate something like that.\u201d During previous BJK Cup ties, the British team have often built team spirit with their own murder mystery game among other things. This year, though, aside from an array of jokes from Watson and Nicholls along with their impressive Australian accents, captain Anne Keothavong says that the preparation has been all business. \u201cQuite frankly, for us as a team to have this opportunity, we do feel very fortunate, the fact that we are the host nation,\u201d Keothavong said. \u201cIt would be amazing. I think for those of us who were at Copper Box, that\u2019s a memory that we created as a team that will stay with us for the rest of our life. \u201cIf we can recreate more moments like that, I think that would be something special, not just individually but as a team and for British tennis, because it\u2019s certainly something we want more of.\u201d"

                    "body": "US and UK financial institutions have been among the leading investors in Russian \u201ccarbon bomb\u201d fossil fuel projects, according to a new database of holdings from recent years. Campaigners in Ukraine said these institutions must immediately end such investments, to limit the funding of Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine and to avoid climate breakdown. Carbon bombs are fossil-fuel extraction projects identified by researchers to contain at least 1bn tonnes of climate-heating CO<sub>2</sub>, triple the UK\u2019s annual emissions. Russia is a hotspot, with 40 carbon bombs, 19 of them operated or developed by Russian companies backed by foreign finance. The companies are Gazprom, Novatek, Lukoil, Rosneft oil company and Tatneft. The database, produced by the Leave it in the Ground Initiative (Lingo), found more than 400 foreign financial institutions had provided $130bn (\u00a3109bn) of support to the Russian companies \u2013 $52bn in investment and $84bn in credit. The data was released on Wednesday, Ukraine\u2019s independence day and six months since the start of the Russian invasion.  Financial institutions in the US hold almost half the foreign investment in Russian carbon bomb companies, with 154 institutions holding $23.6bn. The largest combination of investment and credit \u2013 $10bn \u2013 was provided by JPMorgan Chase, which other analyses have also identified as a leading funder of fossil fuels. The biggest single investment in the Russian carbon bomb companies was the $15.3bn in Rosneft held by the Qatar Investment Authority, Qatar\u2019s sovereign wealth fund. The UK was third in the list of investing nations, with 32 financial institutions holding $2.5bn in investments. HSBC had the largest investment and credit total, at $308m. Financial groups in Japan, Norway, Switzerland and the Netherlands also held significant investments, while Chinese and Italian institutions provided $45bn in credit between them. \u201cPutin\u2019s war is funded through money from fossil fuels and these fossil fuels are causing climate breakdown as we speak,\u201d said Svitlana Romanko, director of the Ukrainian NGO Razom We Stand, which is calling for an immediate end to all foreign investment in Russian fossil fuel companies and a permanent embargo on Russian oil, gas and coal. \u201cInvesting in Russian carbon bombs is the worst thing you can do today.\u201d  Kjell K\u00fchne, at Lingo, said: \u201cThis [war] has made really clear that, when you don\u2019t care who you\u2019re doing business with, it does translate into human suffering and lives lost. It\u2019s also clear we should not be investing in new fossil fuel projects, as the International Energy Agency has confirmed. Anybody involved in these projects should be really questioning what they\u2019re doing.\u201d The Lingo researchers said some financial institutions may have reduced their support for the Russian companies since the war started, but that many seemed to have adopted a wait-and-see approach. The researchers hope the database will enable campaigners to challenge the 400 institutions over their investments. The foreign financial support is largely for big oil and gas projects in Russia, including in Siberia and the Arctic. Coal projects are mainly supported by domestic investors, the researchers said. The database only includes financial support for the Russian fossil fuel companies and not for foreign oil and gas companies that work in Russia, or the services companies that support them. In May, the Guardian revealed that world\u2019s biggest fossil fuel firms were quietly planning huge oil and gas projects that would drive the climate past internationally agreed temperature limits, with catastrophic global impacts. The plans included 195 carbon bombs identified by K\u00fchne and his colleagues, 60% of which have already started pumping. \u201cWe have identified the carbon bombs, now we have to defuse them,\u201d he said. A spokeswoman for HSBC said: \u201cHSBC Asset Management has suspended dealings in its Russia-only funds which include the Russian oil and gas companies referenced and [is] no longer investing further in funds whose objectives included investing in Russian securities. In these funds, exposure to Russian equities has generally been reduced or exited.\u201d JPMorgan Chase and the Qatar Investment Authority have also been contacted for comment."

                    "body": "Good morning. To many observers in the Republican party, Donald Trump was the single biggest drag on their hugely disappointing performance in last week\u2019s US midterm elections. Trump has listened, weighed the available evidence, undertaken a searching examination of his own role in the debacle, and \u2013 you are not going to believe this \u2013 concluded that he disagrees. Instead, he told an enthusiastic audience at Mar-a-Lago overnight, \u201cin order to make America great and glorious again, I am tonight announcing my candidacy for president of the United States.\u201d Persuaded of his own magnificence though Trump is, there are many good reasons to think that his return is extremely bad news for the Republican party. And yet. With the help of the Guardian US reporting team, today\u2019s newsletter will run you through what the former president said, how it was received and what the arguments are for and against \u2013 gulp \u2013 Trump 2024. That\u2019s after the headlines. Five big stories  Russia | Joe Biden has said that a missile that landed in Poland killing two people on Tuesday was \u201cunlikely\u201d to have been fired from Russia due to its trajectory. Amid alarm over at the implications of any attack on Nato territory, Moscow has denied responsibility, while Poland would only say that the missiles appeared to be \u201cRussian-made\u201d. Cop27 | Fear of countries backsliding on their commitments to tackle the climate crisis dominated the Cop27 UN climate talks in Egypt on Tuesday, as the first tentative drafts started to emerge of key potential decisions. Documents and proposals seen by the Guardian showed some countries attempting to unpick agreements and water down commitments. Housing | The death of Awaab Ishak, an \u201cengaging, lively, endearing\u201d two-year-old, was a result of chronic mould in his family\u2019s social housing flat in Rochdale, an inquest said. The coroner said Awaab\u2019s tragic death should be a \u201cdefining moment\u201d for the housing sector. G20 | Rishi Sunak will extend Britain\u2019s hand to China for the first time in almost five years, asking for closer relations on energy and the economy in a meeting with president Xi Jinping on Tuesday. The move risks a backlash from Conservative MPs who have had sanctions imposed upon them by Beijing. Egypt | Alaa Abd el-Fattah, the British-Egyptian democracy activist in jail in Egypt, has said in a letter to his family that he has ended his six-month hunger strike.  In depth: \u2018It feels very strange to be back here again\u2019  Trump\u2019s advisers had hoped his speech might be limited to 45 minutes: in the event, he continued for more than an hour. David Smith sent a voice note from the Mar-a-Lago ballroom shortly after he finished. Trump\u2019s confirmation of his intention to run \u201cprompted an eruption of cheers and whistles from several hundred guests under the crystal chandeliers,\u201d he said, but \u201capart from that I think the general consensus here is that it was a pretty low energy speech \u2026 unusually for anyone who\u2019s been to one of his rallies, it was at times quite boring.\u201d There were some characteristically wild moments, like his vow that drug dealers will \u201creceive the death penalty for their heinous acts\u201d. But overall, David said, \u201cI did not see much at Mar-a-Lago tonight that is going to rattle Joe Biden or potential Republican rivals in the primary.\u201d You can read David\u2019s sketch, in which he compares Trump to \u201can ageing champ returning to centre court only to find he\u2019s holding a wooden racket,\u201d here. It feels \u201cvery strange to be back here again\u201d, said Guardian US political correspondent Lauren Gambino. After disappointing midterm results, \u201cthere are all these questions about what the future of the party should look like, and he\u2019s just really pulling them back to 2020\u201d. Here are some arguments for and against Trump\u2019s chances of winning the Republican nomination. *** Why Trump\u2019s not the force he was 1 He was a drag on Republicans in the midterms If ideological or ethical concerns have never been enough to wean the GOP off Trump, cold electoral arithmetic might be. The party has now failed in three elections in a row with him as its figurehead. In a midterm year which by any historic guide should have been a success for the \u201cout\u201d party, Republicans failed to capture the Senate and will only squeak the narrowest of victories in the House of Representatives. Trump ignored those disappointments, instead celebrating: \u201cNancy Pelosi has been fired. Isn\u2019t that nice?\u201d But whatever he says, it looks as if his influence was a crucial reason for the failure. In this analysis for the Washington Post, Philip Wallach, a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, writes that in competitive races, candidates with Trump endorsements fared around seven percentage points worse than those he didn\u2019t support. 2 He\u2019s lost important support in the media and party establishment Until recently, Trump could count on the near-unanimous backing of the conservative media in the US. Now, as Adam Gabbatt writes in his analysis of rightwing media coverage, there have been signs that Rupert Murdoch\u2019s empire may have turned on the former president, who was branded \u201cTrumpty Dumpty\u201d by the New York Post and called \u201cthe Republican party\u2019s biggest loser\u201d by the Wall Street Journal. On Fox News last night, Adam writes, \u201cit seemed that not everyone was ready to let Trump go\u201d. But there were still nuances to the coverage which would once have been unimaginable. \u201cFox News has been tied so closely to Trump for so long that an immediate ditching was always unlikely \u2013 but there were some small signs through the evening that perhaps they\u2019re pulling away,\u201d Adam said in a voice note. He pointed to an interview with possible rival Mike Pence, a \u201cquite subdued\u201d appearance from longtime supporter Sean Hannity, and the decision to cut away from Trump\u2019s speech to analysis even as it continued. \u201cI think in previous years if Trump had a big announcement to make at 9 o\u2019clock, that\u2019s, like, three hours of Fox News coverage sorted \u2013 just Trump, Trump, Trump. It wasn\u2019t that.\u201d It\u2019s not just the media: for one example of how the party establishment feels more able to take on Trump, see this story from Monday on Politico, which notes that the influential Club for Growth \u2013 once a reliable Trump cheerleader \u2013 has pushed out polling data showing him trailing rival Ron DeSantis in key primary states. Even his daughter Ivanka says she will not be part of the 2024 campaign. 3 He has a viable rival on the far right DeSantis (below) was one of the Republican party\u2019s few big winners on election night, beating his Democratic rival by almost 20 points in the race to be governor of Florida. DeSantis is a threat to Trump precisely because he hews pretty closely to his extreme ideology without the former president\u2019s baggage or unpredictability \u2013 and a YouGov poll shows him with a seven-point lead among Republican voters nationally. Trump\u2019s nickname for the man he views as the only serious threat to his domination of the Republican party, Ron DeSanctimonious, is pretty funny \u2013 but Republican voters may ask themselves if they wouldn\u2019t prefer a more \u201cnormal\u201d politician who, at 44, also presents a helpful generational contrast with 79-year-old Joe Biden. For more on the Trump-DeSantis rivalry, see this piece from yesterday by Chris McGreal. And Martin Pengelly has a guide to the other likely candidates.  *** Why he might be the candidate anyway 1 He wasn\u2019t the Republicans\u2019 only problem in the midterms While Trump was undoubtedly an issue for Republican candidates, there are sound arguments that the party\u2019s difficulties were not limited to his influence. In the American Conservative, the successful Trump-endorsed Senate candidate in Ohio, JD Vance, argues that blaming the former president ignores the Democrats\u2019 advantage in \u201csmall-dollar fundraising\u201d and calls Republican efforts \u201cpaltry by comparison\u201d. While the overall fundraising picture is complex, Axios reported that in the 10 most competitive Senate races, Republicans were outraised by $75m among small-dollar donors. It may be hard to wholly separate fundraising from Trump\u2019s influence as rallying force for Democrats. But Vance argues that the best way to solve the problem is to \u201cbuild a turnout machine\u201d and that the party has \u201cone major asset \u2026 to rally these voters: President Donald Trump\u201d. (Unsurprisingly, Trump agrees: he has blamed the GOP establishment, the electoral system, the candidates themselves and reportedly, for her alleged role in leading him to support doomed Senate candidate Mehmet Oz, his wife, Melania.) 2 He can still win the nomination without being very popular A presidential election is another question \u2013 but in the contest for the Republican nomination, Trump can prevail with the highly motivated minority of Republican voters who still prefer him to any other candidate. Republican pollsters estimate that proportion of GOP primary voters at between one-third and 40%. In 2016, Trump won the Republican primary with about 45% of the vote overall, and many states with less than that. Until DeSantis or anyone else proves they can defeat him with voters, he remains a very serious candidate for the nomination. 3 He\u2019s been underestimated before It would be foolish to write off the extensive evidence that Trump\u2019s star is on the wane \u2013 but past experience suggests that it would be equally unwise to write him off so early. Meanwhile, there is no sign that the Republican party is thinking hard about what a successful political message that repudiates Trumpism would look like. One plausible theory is that despite his many disadvantages, his supporters are less interested in winning elections than in maintaining their love affair with the politician who tells them they\u2019re right about everything. \u201cIt\u2019s tempting to see the strength of the Maga forces ebbing at last, the calendar leaf turning over on the Trump era,\u201d Tom Scocca wrote for the New York Times this week. \u201cBut how do you declare defeat for a movement that is built around refusing to accept defeat?\u201d Extremely online  For a raucous summary of how Elon Musk\u2019s ownership of Twitter has gone so far, look no further than this exhaustive thread from @christapeterso.

On paper, beating a side 38 places below them in the world rankings should be a straightforward task for England but Northern Ireland, managed by Kenny Shiels, are a rapidly evolving team and Williamson is refusing to take them lightly.\n\u201cIt was a competitive and difficult game last time, especially in the first half,\u201d she said. \u201cYes, we\u2019ve had some games we\u2019ve won comfortably [in this qualifying campaign] but I don\u2019t expect it to be comfortable on Tuesday \u2013 Northern Ireland are proving with each game that comes that they\u2019re a serious contender.\n\u201cThat\u2019s the beauty of qualification. There\u2019s something to play for and you don\u2019t get much more of a challenge than that.\u201d\n\nFor the Arsenal defender, the occasion will be extra special as it will be the first time she leads England out since the manager, Sarina Wiegman, named her as her captain for the home European Championship this summer.\n\u201cThe main thing is it\u2019s obviously a very proud moment,\u201d Williamson said. \u201cThe biggest honour in football. I appreciate that and I\u2019m aware of the responsibility that comes with that title, especially in England.\n\u201cMy family are obviously very happy for me. For us it\u2019s something we do every day, it\u2019s our job but for them it\u2019s something for them to enjoy and maybe after all these years of following me around and watching me, to watch me then do it on the biggest stage, with that responsibility, is really proud for them.\u201d\nWilliamson is also no stranger to feeling the heat in Belfast. On 9 April 2015, two weeks after her 18th birthday, the then under-19s captain was forced to take a truly bizarre penalty in the city against Norway.\nIt was a replay of a penalty she had taken against the same opponent in a European Championship qualifier five days earlier and which she converted, only for it to be ruled out by the referee Marija Kurtes for encroachment.\nThe German official subsequently awarded Norway a free-kick when she should have ordered the penalty to be retaken \u2013 Uefa intervened and decided it would indeed be retaken, in isolation, in Belfast. Williamson again converted, securing a 2-2 draw for England and sealing their place at the European Championship finals.\n\n\u201cIt turned out well in the end but what I went through that week I wouldn\u2019t wish on anybody,\u201d Williamson said. \u201cI remember I told my mum I would keep it quiet in case I missed and nobody would ever know, and then you lot turned up with your Sky Sports cameras. There\u2019s a couple of the girls here that were in that squad and we were reminiscing about it the other day. It\u2019s a good memory because it turned out well, but it could have gone very differently.\u201d\nLooking ahead to the World Cup qualifier against Northern Ireland, as well as beyond, Wiegman said: \u201cAs we approach every game we are looking to develop our style of play, we want to play well, we want to play good as a team and tomorrow we want to create lots of chances and concede no goals.\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be a tough game, it\u2019s going to be a great crowd, a big occasion, so I\u2019m really looking forward to that, For them, it\u2019s possibly the last chance they have to win to be able to qualify and we want to win and get as close as possible to qualifying.\u201d"

                    "body": "Fikayo Tomori is not normally one for a post-match snack, but on the way back from Milan\u2019s win at Napoli this month he made an exception. \u201cOne of the players came up to me and said: \u2018You should try this, it\u2019s from Naples,\u2019\u201d he recalls of having a tray with two sfogliatelle \u2013 traditional crispy pastries with a sweet filling \u2013 thrust under his nose. \u201cAfter games I can\u2019t normally eat because my body\u2019s all over the place, but I tried it. Then it was like: \u2018Ahhhh, that\u2019s kinda nice!\u2019\u201d  He chuckles at the memory of a moment that has gone viral, Tomori\u2019s suspicious first bite, furrowed brow and then furiously enthusiastic nodding further securing his place in the affections of supporters he had already won over with performances on the pitch. In 14 months, the Englishman has gone from a speculative mid-season loan signing to one of the first names on the teamsheet for a side top of Serie A. Seamless integration on the pitch has been mirrored in his approach to life off it. Fans were surprised, after that win over Napoli, to see Tomori deliver an interview in near fluent Italian. \u201cI always saw myself one day living in another country,\u201d says Tomori, \u201cwhether that was for football or just in life. I always wanted to learn a new language. At home, my parents were from Nigeria, so they spoke Yoruba to me, and obviously at school you learn languages, but I came to Italy determined to learn Italian. Even if I was only going to be here on loan six months, I wanted to at least be able to know the present tense.\u201d It may have been that mindset that ensured his stay would last longer, Milan making his transfer permanent for close to \u20ac28.5m. Tomori arrived last January with his career at a crossroads, a 23-year-old graduate of the Chelsea academy who had started 15 Premier League games for the Blues during the 2019-20 season but none in the first half of the following campaign. Milan needed cover at centre-back, with Simon Kj\u00e6r struggling through a series of injuries and their captain, Alessio Romagnoli, out of form. As the manager, Stefano Pioli, told the Observer in January, he had been impressed by aspects of the player\u2019s game on video but found Tomori\u2019s attitude and approach to be \u201ca positive surprise in every way\u201d.  The admiration is mutual, Tomori appreciating the way Pioli will come to him even after a good match and talk through specific situations where he could have adjusted his positioning. Such intense focus on details represents a key point of difference for the player between Serie A and the Premier League. \u201cIn England, it\u2019s more like basketball,\u201d says Tomori. \u201cEverything\u2019s end-to-end, there\u2019s more intensity, a lot more happens reactively. In Italy it\u2019s more like American football. It\u2019s like you have \u2018plays\u2019. When the ball\u2019s here, I need to be here. When the ball goes, I know I have to be two metres over in that direction, or be looking for this particular player \u2026 \u201cIn England it\u2019s very much off the cuff and things happen so fast. You can be attacking one minute and the next the ball\u2019s flipped over your head and you\u2019ve got to run back 30 yards, then you\u2019re back on the attack. Here it\u2019s more like: \u2018OK, the ball\u2019s there, where\u2019s my teammate? Where\u2019s the opposition?\u2019 If the ball goes over the top I need to be in a position where I can leave the striker and get there, but if the ball goes into feet I\u2019m in a position to go press.\u201d It is not just Pioli helping him to work out these finer points. Tomori\u2019s decision to join Milan was sealed by a call from Paolo Maldini, \u201cthe best defender ever\u201d, now the Milan technical director. Although not involved with day-to-day coaching, he is happy to share advice. \u201cThe other day he was talking to us about the speed of the ball moving through the back and how to work on our body position,\u201d says Tomori. \u201cAs defenders, you want to make sure you\u2019re impressing him.\u201d  Tomori believes he has improved at Milan, especially in his concentration and tactical awareness. Yet after being called up by England for the first time in two years last September he was omitted for World Cup qualifiers in November and again for this month\u2019s friendlies. Instead, he travelled to Dubai this week to meet supporters and help run a kids\u2019 training session at the local AC Milan Academy, as part of the club\u2019s delegation to Expo 2020. To miss out is a disappointment for a player who aspires to be part of England\u2019s squad for Qatar 2022, but Tomori does not believe playing in Italy has put him at a disadvantage. \u201cThere\u2019s just so many talented players in my position already \u2013 [Harry] Maguire, [John] Stones, [Conor] Coady, [Tyrone] Mings, [Ben] White at Arsenal \u2013 and there\u2019s a limited amount of positions. \u201cI just have to make sure I\u2019m playing at a high level. And then when I do get called on, to make sure I\u2019m ready. I have to focus on what I\u2019m doing here at Milan first and foremost.\u201d In the meantime, he can take satisfaction from having helped, in a roundabout way, Tammy Abraham to get his international career back on track. His former Chelsea teammate sought his advice when the option of a Serie A move arose last summer. \u201cWhen he said Roma was on the table, I said: \u2018Bro this is a good league\u2019,\u201d recalls Tomori. \u201cI felt like it would develop his game a lot. He has scored a lot of goals this season for Roma, they\u2019re fighting for a Champions League spot. Definitely it\u2019s helped him and definitely I gave him rave reviews about Serie A because I enjoyed myself so much the first six months.\u201d He is still relishing it. Tomori has noticed himself adjusting the way he lives in countless little ways \u2013 from the must-have macchiato after every meal, where previously he never drank coffee, to a new preference for relaxing outside with friends and fresh air on the terrace after training instead of heading home. \u201cI was speaking to my sister yesterday, and that\u2019s family, she\u2019s known me her whole life. And she said: \u2018You just seem a lot calmer, a lot smilier.\u2019 I think that\u2019s probably the way Italy is. Everything is a bit more chilled. In England, everything is so rushed and hustle and bustle. In Italy, everyone\u2019s walking a bit slower. Everything\u2019s just a bit calmer.\u201d Not everything is perfect. Our conversation takes place shortly before Milan\u2019s 1-0 win at Cagliari, where monkey chants were aimed at Tomori and his teammate Mike Maignan during the post-game celebrations. Previously, Tomori said he had not experienced any racist abuse in Italy, although he was aware of cases at Serie A games. He later shares his experience of the events in Sardinia via a recorded voice note.  \u201cObviously that was not a good moment,\u201d Tomori says. \u201cBut all the players helped me to get away from the situation. Everyone knew what was going on. I spoke to the referee and since then everyone\u2019s been very supportive and tried to give me as much support as possible, which was great. The steps to try and stop this is what we need to do next. It was a sad moment for me and Mike as well but the club were very supportive and they gave a reaction to it very quickly.\u201d  Tomori has spoken before about racist abuse on social media and remains frustrated by companies\u2019 failure to do more to close it down. \u201cYou could make a foul, concede a penalty, anything, and by the time you get back in the changing room, you\u2019ve got a thousand messages from nobody. People who make a fake account, people who know they can say this without having any consequences, feel like they\u2019re untouchable, whatever it may be. Social media companies should be able to do more to curtail what\u2019s happening.\u201d Tomori will continue to speak out against racism \u2013 the incident in Cagliari occurred on the weekend the league launched an anti-racism campaign with a video that he was part of \u2013 but also focus on his own career ambitions. On the day he arrived at Milan, and walked through the club\u2019s museum, Tomori spoke of wanting to live up to the club\u2019s history by winning trophies. In the long run, he hopes that will include European success, something he believes is achievable despite the club\u2019s Champions League group-stage exit this season and the failure of any Italian sides to reach the quarter-finals. \u201cI think there\u2019s cycles in football,\u201d he says. \u201cBefore it was Real Madrid, Barcelona, then it was Bayern Munich, then it was the English teams. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a specific correlation between Italian football and not doing well in the Champions League.  \u201cFor a lot of players in our team this season was their first experience of Champions League football. And we didn\u2019t have an easy group [alongside Liverpool, Atl\u00e9tico Madrid and Porto].\u201d  The immediate objective is to claim this season\u2019s Serie A title. It would be Tomori\u2019s first senior trophy. With eight games remaining, Milan have a three-point lead over second-place Napoli. Tomori is tickled to know that Pioli\u2019s mum still reminds him every season that he is yet to win a trophy in senior management. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say my parents give me a hard time like that,\u201d he says with a chuckle. \u201cBut it\u2019s obviously something they want me to do, they want me to have a successful career. \u201cWe\u2019re in a good position but we\u2019re taking it game by game. Hopefully at the end we have something to celebrate, and the manager\u2019s mum can let him rest.\u201d"

                    "body": "Chris Woakes is to undergo a knee operation on Thursday in an attempt to resuscitate his chances of appearing at the Twenty20 World Cup, which starts in October. He was one of two players \u2013 and the only bowler \u2013 to be in the England squad for the T20 World Cup in the United Arab Emirates as well as the Ashes in Australia from November to January and a Test tour of the Caribbean.  Woakes returned from the West Indies in March with injuries to his shoulder and his knee and has since reported a minor problem with an ankle. He has played one second XI match this summer. He was initially told to take \u201ca bit of a break\u201d, but doctors now suspect there is a problem with the cartilage of his left knee that will require surgery. Recovery if the operation is successful is expected to take between four and six weeks, leaving him with a battle to prove his fitness before the seven T20s England have scheduled in Pakistan in September as part of their World Cup preparations. It is the second time in less than a week that an England seamer has felt forced to undergo surgery to try to win a place on the plane to Australia after Mark Wood \u2013 who had an operation on his right elbow in March \u2013 had a second procedure on the same joint last weekend. Four other England bowlers \u2013 Jofra Archer, Olly Stone, Saqib Mahmood and Matt Fisher \u2013 are recovering from stress fractures to the back, while this week Ollie Robinson is playing his first game in more than two months, for Sussex against Nottinghamshire in the County Championship.  Having rested since his return from the West Indies, Woakes reported in early June that he had \u201cturned a corner\u201d. At the time he said: \u201cI\u2019ve got the ball back in my hand, albeit some very light bowling sessions, but I feel like competitive cricket isn\u2019t too far away.\u201d He played at the end of that month for Warwickshire\u2019s second XI in a four-day game against Worcestershire\u2019s second XI, but after bowling nine overs was withdrawn with discomfort to his knee, did not bat or bowl in the second innings, and has not played a competitive game since."

                    "body": "The acting head of the UN mission in Afghanistan met Taliban leaders on Monday in a bid to persuade them to withdraw their ban on all women working for aid agencies.\nRamiz Alakbarov met the Taliban\u2019s economy minister, Din Mohammad Hanif, in Kabul, telling him that millions of Afghans need \u201chumanitarian assistance and removing barriers is vital\u201d.\nNida Mohammad Nadim, the Taliban higher education minister, responded to the international criticism, saying his government will not change its mind on girls\u2019 access to education \u201ceven if they drop an atomic bomb on us\u201d adding \u201cwe are ready for sanctions by the international community\u201d.\nMeanwhile, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Qatar announced in a statement that access to work is a principle of human rights that is accepted by all countries of the world. It is the latest government of a Muslim country to criticise the Taliban\u2019s move.\nAt least seven major international aid groups have suspended their vitally needed operations in Afghanistan, potentially leaving the country\u2019s battered economy on the brink of collapse. The aid agencies hope that by acting in unison and showing solidarity, they can convince the Taliban they have crossed a red line that makes it impossible for the NGOs to operate.\nAbout a third of the NGOs\u2019 staff are women, and seen as vital in providing services in a culturally appropriate way. The ban applies to NGOs, but does not as yet apply to the staff of UN agencies such as the World Food Programme and the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs.\nIn a bid to head off a ban, the aid agencies had held meetings with the Taliban leadership, giving assurances over female staff wearing the hijab and travelling extended distances only in the company of a male.\nBut the NGOs said the Taliban had ignored the undertakings and revoked the promises.\nThe move was seen as a decisive signal that Taliban had decided to reimpose all the repressive measures against women that it enforced in the 1990s when it was last in power, and in so doing finally buried the notion that the rural Pashtun conservative culture was no longer dominant in the Taliban leadership. Many had suggested the Taliban had reformed during their two decades out of power.\nLast week, the Taliban also banned women from attending university. Girls are already banned from secondary schools, and in November, women were banned from public gardens, gymnasiums and public baths.\nJan Egeland, chief executive of the Norwegian Refugee Council, admitted the temporary suspension of services had been difficult, but told the BBC: \u201cwe cannot work in an effective and qualitatively good enough manner with only male staff. They cannot deal directly with women according to the traditions in Afghanistan. We cannot function without a third of our staff.\n\u201cWe would disintegrate as a principled organisation if we compromised on this and stumbled along with only male staff. As I told the Taliban several times, we respect their traditional values and for us it is a fundamental value that we have gender equality in the workplace.\n\u201cWe cannot compromise on this one. If they want their population to have aid as they want, they have to nullify this decision. My heart is bleeding for those out in the open, freezing and starving in terrible conditions, and which we were planning to help next week. The Taliban are responsible for this from A to Z, and we have to call a spade a spade.\u201d\nApart from the NRC, Save the Children, the International Rescue Committee (IRC), Islamic Relief, Care, Christian Aid and World Vision have all said they are suspending aid, although some said they may yet provide aid if it is required to save a life.\nThe NGOs are critical to the provision of healthcare, education, child protection and nutrition services and support amid worsening conditions. Successive droughts and a freeze on development aid to Afghanistan badly affected the health system, and have left 11 million people in need of humanitarian food assistance.\nThe IRC, which employs 3,000 women in a staff of 8,000, said in a statement: \u201cThe exclusion of women from humanitarian service delivery will have catastrophic consequences for the Afghan people because our services depend on women workers.\u201d\nOne of the strongest reactions came from the German foreign minister, Annalena Baerbock, who said: \u201cWe will not accept that the Taliban are making humanitarian aid a pawn in their misogyny. They rob half the population of another fundamental right, violate humanitarian principles and endanger people\u2019s vital needs.\u201d\n\nTop US officials, including the secretary of state, Antony Blinken, and the charg\u00e9e d\u2019affaires to Afghanistan, Karen Decker, condemned the move.\nDecker, tweeting in the Dari language on Sunday, said: \u201cAs a representative of the largest donor of humanitarian assistance to Afghanistan, I feel I have the right to an explanation of how the Taliban intends to prevent women and children from starving, when women are no longer permitted to distribute assistance to other women and children.\u201d\nHer remarks triggered a response from the Taliban-led government\u2019s chief spokesperson, Zabihullah Mujahid, who said all institutions wanting to operate in the country were obliged to comply with its rules and regulations.\n\u201cWe do not allow anyone to talk rubbish or make threats regarding the decisions of our leaders under the title of humanitarian aid,\u201d he said in a tweet.\n\nThe Australian foreign minister, Penny Wong, condemned the \u201cappalling decision\u201d, saying on Twitter it \u201cseriously impacts the country\u2019s ability to deal with a major humanitarian crisis\u201d.\nSince the Taliban took over, government foreign aid stopped almost overnight. Sanctions on Taliban rulers, a halt on bank transfers and frozen billions in Afghanistan\u2019s currency reserves have already restricted access to global institutions. The aid agencies not only distribute food, but administer health clinics. According to the European Commission, by 2023, 28 million Afghans (out of a population of more than 39 million) will need humanitarian assistance, including 13 million children. Nearly 20 million people are hungry and nearly six million survive on less than one meal a day.\nThe ban on female students attending universities triggered demonstrations in several Afghan cities with many chanting \u201cwomen, life, freedom\u201d, the slogan adopted by opponents of the compulsory hijab in Afghanistan. But the protests lasted only minutes before police intervened, including female officers. The deputy prime minister for political affairs, Abdul Kabir, met to discuss the ban on women attending university with a delegation of the Union of Private Universities of Afghanistan, and told them the ban would be lifted soon. Similar promises about revoking the ban on girls attending secondary schools were made, but were never fulfilled.\n\nAt about midnight on Saturday in the western city of Herat, where earlier protesters were dispersed with water cannon, people opened their windows and chanted \u201cAllahu Akbar\u201d (God is the greatest) in solidarity with female students."

                    "body": "The A-Leagues will hold their version of a pride round for the first time later this month in a player-driven, opt-in initiative experts have lauded as more meaningful than similar events staged by some other codes. The Australian Professional Leagues on Wednesday announced its inaugural pride celebration, to be held in Australia across the weekend of 24-26 February and in New Zealand on 4 March to preach diversity and inclusion.  It comes after Australian football\u2019s second Pride Cup was confirmed for 26 February, when Adelaide United and Melbourne Victory will meet at AAMI Park in a game Adelaide\u2019s openly gay player Josh Cavallo hopes will help change sport across the board. The round is called a \u201cpride celebration\u201d as opposed to a \u201cpride round\u201d on the basis that, while there is still much to be improved, the behind-the-scenes work already done deserves recognition. That includes education programs for club executives, staff and players, a trial of a new stadium safety and inclusion programme with the Melbourne Olympic Parks Trust (MOPT) which is now being rolled out nationally, and the introduction of GoBubble technology to help silence online hate for clubs, players and fans. \u201cThe pride celebration is grounded in education, training and an ambition for long-term impact,\u201d said A-Leagues chief executive, Danny Townsend. \u201cWe\u2019re getting the foundations right to make positive change. This is certainly a long-term project, but we\u2019re committed to ensuring every person involved with our game feels safe and included.\u201d Of particular importance to Pride Cup chief executive, James Lolicato, was the community element, with $1 from every ticket sold to be donated to Pride Cup\u2019s community fund to support clubs and their own pride events. Lolicato said Pride Cup was taking \u201ca long-term approach\u201d to combating, within all levels of the game, ingrained homophobic and transphobic language \u2013 the most damaging to the health and wellbeing of LGBTI+ people. \u201cWe started this work in 2021, and we\u2019ve been working alongside the A-leagues and all of the clubs on the development and the understanding \u2026 talking to them and discussing where the problem lies,\u201d Lolicato said. \u201cThe problem can\u2019t be fixed by running out in a rainbow guernsey or holding a Pride round. How it can be fixed is when we implement community development, when we implement education, and when we implement programs into the wider A-Leagues community.\u201d The other point of difference is the heavy involvement of the player\u2019s union, Professional Footballers Australia, in consulting with players to avoid situations like that which occurred at the Manly Sea Eagles last year, when the NRL club was forced to apologise for its \u201cpoor\u201d execution in unveiling a pride jersey that was subsequently boycotted by seven players on religious and cultural grounds. It also follows a similar backlash in the NBL in January, when Cairns Taipans players opted not to wear the jersey in the competition\u2019s inaugural pride round, arguing they were protecting an unnamed player or players who had been \u201cvilified\u201d after reports of their hesitancy to wear the uniform on religious grounds. \u201cThe A-League seems to be taking a much better approach than we\u2019ve seen in other sports, in that there is a strong focus on encouraging local football clubs to host pride games and raising money to support local clubs to host the events,\u201d said Erik Denison, a behavioural science researcher at Monash University and lead author of the first international study on homophobia in sport. \u201cThis is something that we haven\u2019t seen in other sports and it\u2019s very important because we urgently need to stop the constant use of homophobic language in children\u2019s sport, because this behaviour is harmful to all children.\u201d However Denison, who was recently critical of the Australian Open\u2019s pride day, was concerned about the A-Leagues\u2019 use of the term \u201ccelebration\u201d and its risk of \u201cgenerating backlash\u201d like that in rugby league and basketball. \u201cI think the marketing people at sports clubs believe that calling these events a \u2018celebration\u2019 will make them more palatable to the public, but we\u2019ve found the opposite,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s much better to focus on how these events are held to stop the pervasive homophobic behaviour that is harmful, particularly to children. \u201cWe have found highly religious athletes support pride events, but only when you explain to them that these games are an effective way to stop behaviours that are harming children. However, when we see them use the term \u2018celebration\u2019, this is generally when we see a backlash from these religious athletes. It seems to trigger them. This is because these athletes feel their religion prevents them from \u2018celebrating\u2019 or encouraging homosexuality.\u201d"

                    "body": "Steve Evans, the manager of Stevenage, acclaimed his League Two players\u2019 \u201chearts the size of Big Ben\u201d as they knocked Aston Villa, 59 places above them in the pyramid, out of the FA Cup in the biggest shock of an exhilarating weekend of third-round upsets. As Villa\u2019s new manager, Unai Emery, admitted he may need to start making greater demands of his players, who lost 2-1 after leading until Jamie Reid\u2019s 88th minute penalty, 3,000 Stevenage fans raucously celebrated reaching the fourth round for the first time in nine years.  Villa have now lost eight consecutive games in this competition, stretching back to 2016, but the glory belongs to Stevenage, whose highest ever finish was sixth in the third tier 11 years ago. Evans, the former Crawley Town and Boston United manager, said: \u201cIt\u2019s magical for the players, the chairman and for the town of Stevenage to see over 3,000 fans and, winning the way we did, it\u2019s the FA Cup and what dreams are made of. \u201cI said to the players they will have a dream they will talk to the kids and grandkids about it. I\u2019ve got grandkids and little Joseph, James and Mimi will be hearing about in the next few years.\u201d Morgan Sanson had given Villa a first-half lead but Emery, with a proud cup pedigree with Sevilla and PSG, criticised his players\u2019 lack of clinical finishing. To Stevenage\u2019s credit, they kept a tight shape, with a midfield square in front of a back four, and squeezed the space Villa were allowed to play in. After Leander Dendoncker was sent off for conceding the penalty, Stevenage went for broke and Dean Campbell smashed in the winner in the 90th minute. Evans added: \u201cWe stayed in the game and the gameplan all week was to make sure we were in the game at 75 minutes. If we were in the game at 75 minutes I knew we had an incredible, fit group and I could use the lads who have hearts the size of Big Ben.\u201d Villa\u2019s players were praised for their sportsmanship afterwards and Evans felt for World Cup winner Emi Mart\u00ednez, whom he had on loan at Rotherham United and was a substitute for this game. \u201cEmi gave us a hug afterwards,\u201d Evans said. \u201cIf you\u2019re Emi Mart\u00ednez, you\u2019ll be haunted. I looked at Ashley Young and you could see the hurt on his face, maybe the embarrassment.\u201d Emery said: \u201cI\u2019m upset, disappointed and sorry for our supporters. We have lost a very good opportunity to do something in the FA Cup. \u201cIt is a process and I will continue to be demanding. Maybe now, I need to be more demanding. I\u2019m very shocked. But it can happen when you have good chances to score but don\u2019t take them.\u201d"

                    "body": "Eddie Howe would later admit he was not really thirsty but that failed to prevent Newcastle\u2019s manager from unscrewing the top of the small bottle of water in front of him and taking a long, very slow, sip. It was such an obvious timewasting tactic that, by the time he put it back on the table, laughter filled the room. \u201cI\u2019m conveniently drinking my water,\u201d Howe joked after being asked whether he would prefer to finish in the Premier League\u2019s top four or win the Carabao Cup. The 45-year-old had evidently forgotten that, in an unguarded moment, after last Tuesday night\u2019s Carabao Cup win against Bournemouth, he had admitted: \u201cThe Premier League\u2019s our priority.\u201d  And so it surely should be. With Newcastle third as the top tier resumes after its hiatus for the World Cup, a place in next season\u2019s Champions League must feel almost within touching distance for the club\u2019s Saudi Arabian majority owners. An awful lot can change over the 23 games ahead but Howe appeared cautiously optimistic as he prepared for Monday\u2019s trip to Leicester. \u201cIt\u2019s in our hands,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019d like to think we\u2019re prepared for what\u2019s coming at us. I\u2019d like to think the team are ready to play in different ways and I don\u2019t mean just system-wise. \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure the second half of the season will be tougher but that\u2019s healthy. We\u2019re confident; we\u2019ll embrace the challenge.\u201d Allan Saint-Maximin, Newcastle\u2019s French winger, recently revealed he had spoken to his compatriot Marcus Thuram, the France and Borussia Monchengladbach forward, about the benefits of joining Newcastle. \u201cThanks Maxi,\u201d said Howe, who expects to finally welcome his \u00a360m Sweden striker Alexander Isak back from injury next month. \u201cThuram\u2019s one of the players I looked at during the World Cup but that\u2019s as far as it\u2019s gone.  \u201cI don\u2019t know what our window will look like. I\u2019ve got to be careful not to do something that unsettles the group yet you also don\u2019t want it to become stale. But it would be difficult to improve our starting XI without spending serious money and financial fair play rules will make that tough.\u201d Howe swiftly debunked suggestions that Newcastle might fund fresh purchases by selling Saint-Maximin. \u201cFor me, any time Maxi is unavailable is a disaster because he\u2019s unique,\u201d he said, expressing hope the winger has seen off the hamstring problems which interrupted the season\u2019s first half. \u201cHe\u2019s got skills no defender wants to face. Maxi\u2019s a massive player for us and there\u2019s so much more to come from him. \u201cFor me, he\u2019s the best dribbler in the Premier League. He\u2019s got the ability to put any opponent on the back foot. The team performed really well in his absence but he\u2019s undoubtedly got the qualities we\u2019re going to need in the second half of the season. When he\u2019s fully fit, Maxi\u2019s a key player from the off. He\u2019s absolutely not an impact sub.\u201d  In Howe\u2019s ideal word, Saint-Maximin and Brazil\u2019s Bruno Guimar\u00e3es would be exchanging passes with James Maddison at St James\u2019 Park. Leicester\u2019s England midfielder remains high on Howe\u2019s shopping list and although a deal next month may well be too difficult to complete, he did not dismiss the notion entirely. \u201cI never talk about other clubs\u2019 players,\u201d said Howe, who, despite frequently showering Jonjo Shelvey with praise, could conceivably sell the playmaker, who certain predecessors found high-maintenance when he was outside the first XI. \u201cBut \u2026 James Maddison\u2019s been absolutely brilliant this season \u2026 he\u2019s a great advert for the Premier League.\u201d Like it or not, Newcastle are in effect unofficial ambassadors for Saudi Arabia. At some point in the coming months they are expected to attend a warm-weather training camp in the new, lavishly futuristic Red Sea resort rapidly taking shape along the kingdom\u2019s west coast, 300 miles north of Jeddah. It is not intended to merely draw sun-starved northern Europeans towards its glorious winter climate, but to help change international perceptions of the country. That may seem an unrealistic ambition, but a year ago so too did the idea that Howe and Newcastle would now be giving J\u00fcrgen Klopp, Erik ten Hag, Antonio Conte, Graham Potter and company genuine cause for concern."

And thank you for coming along this Euro 2022 ride with us throughout the tournament. 56 years of hurt are over for England and boy does it feel good. I\u2019ll leave you with some articles to sink your teeth into:\n\n\n\nAnd here are the final highlights:\n\n\n\n\n 5.51pm  \n\nPlayer of the Tournament and Golden Boot winner Beth Mead is among the favourites to pick up BBC\u2019s Sports Personality of the Year. I\u2019m going to guess it will be one of the Lionesses who picks up the gong this year, probably Mead or captain Leah Williamson.\n\n\n\n 5.47pm  \n\nSome more insight into the celebration last night from Lucy Bronze via freelance journalist Rich Laverty: \u201cCrazy, dancing, cake, drinks, dancing again. The last message I sent on my phone was at four o\u2019clock in the morning. It didn\u2019t make much sense. And then we all had to get up at half past eight to have a meeting and then come here. [Trafalgar Square].\u201d\n\n\n\n 5.40pm  \n\nEach England player wrote themselves into history last night but who performed the best throughout the tournament? Louise Taylor rated each player\u2019s performance in the ground-breaking event, have a read here:\n\n\n\n\n 5.34pm  \n\nThe celebrations are iconic and our very own Barry Glendenning has written about them: \u201cThis morning, England\u2019s jubilant players emerged blinking into the sunlight, with several looking commendably the worse for wear. Dark glasses were employed by many to hide the ravages of what one presumes was a raucous night of well-earned celebration, while Lucy Bronze appeared to have gone \u201cfull Flintoff\u201d and pitched up at a packed Trafalgar Square looking heartwarmingly refreshed and wearing what looked suspiciously like ski goggles.\u201d Read the full piece:\n\n\n\n\n 5.28pm  \n\nMillie Bright has been a massive part of the England team this summer, being an absolute wall in defence, and she struggled to articulate the win to her club Chelsea\u2019s website. \u201cI can\u2019t even put it into words right now,\u201d she said. \u201cA summer to remember, so proud of everyone; the team, the staff, the players, the fans have been incredible. I hope everyone is proud of what this nation has achieved, not just us winning, but the crowds we have rallied up game after game, not only for ourselves but for every team, it\u2019s been incredible.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n 5.20pm  \nFay White: I was England captain when women\u2019s football struggled for attention: how far we\u2019ve come\n\nIf you read anything today make sure it is this column by former England captain Faye White. Here\u2019s a snippet: \u201cI watched history made at Wembley on Sunday, with my two young sons beside me. I couldn\u2019t sleep that night. I just kept scrolling through social media to see all the joy and celebration, and then I watched the match all over again on TV \u2013 I didn\u2019t want to miss one moment of this magnificent occasion. I\u2019m tired, but I\u2019m sure I\u2019m not as tired as the Lionesses, who I know will have had a huge celebration \u2013 as we would have done when I was England captain between 2002 and 2012.\u201d\n\n\nUpdated at 5.42pm BST\n\n\n 5.14pm  \n\nHow have you, the fans, been reacting to this historic win? Have a read below of how England supporters are celebrating:\n\n\n\n\n 5.06pm  \n\nSo what do you once you have won a Euros? Target a World Cup of course! Winning scorer Chloe Kelly said: \u201cOne is not enough \u2013 we want more.\u201d And she added: \u201cLooking at this medal makes you so much hungrier for more. The World Cup is around the corner. I want to win trophies. As a young girl you grow up seeing people win trophies and we\u2019re here doing that.\u201d Read the full piece:\n\n\n\n\n 5.00pm  \n\nElla Toone\u2019s opener in the final yesterday was the 500th goal scored in the women\u2019s Euros. A lovely stat to add to a glittering career.\n\n\n\n\n 4.54pm  \n\nIt wasn\u2019t just England who received a celebration today, the German team also had a welcome return. Have a look at this video from goalkeeper Merle Frohms\u2019 Instagram story:\n\n\n\n\n 4.48pm  \n\nReports are coming in the Football Association are looking to extend Sarina Wiegman\u2019s deal after her historic Euros win. The manager\u2019s current deal runs until 2025 but bosses want to nail her in for a longer contract. Thoughts? \n\n\n\n\n 4.42pm  \n\nThere have been so many standout moments of this Euros but one of the sweetest has to be eight-year-old Tess dancing to Sweet Caroline. She received final tickets and even got to hold the trophy!\n\n\n\n\n 4.36pm  \n\nImpact of this Euros already taking shape:\n\n\n\n\n 4.30pm  \n\nCameron has got in touch and said: \u201cSo I see that the England women\u2019s team will soon face the ultimate test: not the United States, but a wet Tuesday night in Stoke (against Luxembourg)\u201c After winning the Euros there isn\u2019t anything they can\u2019t face!\n\n\n\n 4.26pm  \n\nBrighton are all over the signings today as they announce midfielder Yeeun Park has joined the club on a two-year deal. The WSL side have also announced Elisabeth Terland as a new signing today.\n\n\n\n 4.19pm  \n\nItching to watch England again? Well they will be back playing on home soil in September, the tickets for the game are already on sale:\n\n\n\n\n 4.12pm  \n\nJust when Manchester United fans couldn\u2019t think there could be more good news after Toone, Russo and Earps win the Euros, Lucy Staniforth has extended for the club. The star\u2019s new deal runs until the end of the upcoming season and she said: \u201cI\u2019m really grateful to be given this opportunity and want to make sure I hit the ground running this season and contribute as much as I can. I feel great in myself and I\u2019m really looking forward to the new campaign.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n 4.06pm  \n\nThis tournament has seen so many stars shine. Cascarino, Bonmati, Popp and Mead to name a few but this Euros was also one for the keepers. Van Domselaar saved around 25 shots and Thalmann, Earps, Frohms and so many other shot stoppers impressed. This is surely the save of the tournament though for Van Domselaar:\n\n\n\n\n 3.57pm  \n\nThese pictures will bring you a lot of joy on this sunny Monday:\n\n\n\n\n 3.52pm  \n\nIt\u2019s worth giving a nod to Ellen White for her tournament, maybe not as many goals scored as expected but she has closed in on Wayne Rooney\u2019s all-time England goal record. She now has 52 to her name behind Rooney\u2019s 53 and the Lionesses play again in September so she could have the record soon.\n\n\n\n\n 3.47pm  \n\nMore handball chat anyone? Christopher has emailed and said: \u201cI don\u2019t think the replays were particularly conclusive though. It didn\u2019t seem obvious from what I saw that the ball hit the arm rather than the shoulder / t-shirt area that IFAB currently use to define the offence. It was one those where VAR wouldn\u2019t have overturned either decision from the onfield ref and both decisions are defensible. So yes, we can count ourselves a bit lucky in the \u201cyou\u2019ve seen them given\u201d sort of way, but it\u2019s no great scandal IMO.\u201d\n\n\n\n 3.42pm  \n\nManchester United\u2019s Ella Toone scored the opener yesterday but she was a bit \u201cgutted\u201d, saying: \u201cI got them done and they fell out, now I\u2019m at the final with no lashes - it\u2019s a nightmare. I\u2019m actually really gutted. I\u2019m off to Ibiza tomorrow - get home, get my lashes done.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n 3.36pm  \n\nA lot of football fans may have looked at Chloe Kelly\u2019s celebration last night and thought of the US\u2019 Brandi Chastain\u2019s celebration from the 1999 World Cup. The star herself thought it too and tweeted: \u201cI see you @Chloe_Kelly98 well done. Enjoy the free rounds of pints and dinners for the rest of your life from all of England.

The latest sees Elisabeth Terland, who competed for Norway this summer, move to Brighton from Brann. Check out all the rest of the moves here:\n\n\n\n\n 3.23pm  \n\nGerman chancellor Olaf Scholz was at Wembley to cheer on his national side in the final yesterday but Prime Minister Boris Johnson wasn\u2019t present.\n\u201cAsked why Johnson did not do the same, despite sporting an England top as he watched from the crowd when Gareth Southgate\u2019s side took second place in the delayed Euro 2020 tournament, his spokesperson said: \u201cThe prime minister did watch the game at home along with, I think, 17.4 million other people.\u201d\u201d\n\n\n\n\n 3.15pm  \n\nI know all you England fans reading this wanted to be in Trafalgar Square this afternoon for the celebrations. Well here\u2019s a video to make you feel as though you were there, which you were in spirit!\n\n\n\n\n 3.07pm  \n\nCaptain Leah Williamson described manager Sarina Wiegman as the \u2018secret ingredient\u2019 England have been missing and I can\u2019t help but agree. Under the boss England have conceded just five goals in 20 matches and they haven\u2019t lost a single game.\n\n\n\n\n 3.00pm  \n\nHere are some pieces you should read and listen to about that historic final last night:\n\n\n\n\nUpdated at 3.00pm BST\n\n\n 2.51pm  \n\nThe discussion of if Williamson\u2019s handball was a penalty rumbles on. Nigel has got in touch and said: \u201cIt is (only) an offence if a player touches the ball with their hand/arm when the position of their hand/arm is NOT a consequence of, or justifiable by, the player\u2019s body movement for that specific situation.\u201d It\u2019s a close one to call but I think England were a touch lucky VAR didn\u2019t get the referee to look at it.\n\n\n\n\n 2.45pm  \n\nChloe Kelly said of her winning goal: \u201cI was here on crutches that day watching Bobby Zamora score that winner and I said to my family this morning: \u2018There\u2019s going to be a Bobby Zamora moment today\u2019, and there was! Unbelievable. You \u2018Rs!\u201d\nNow Bobby Zamora has heard about it and tweeted:\n\n\n\n\n 2.40pm  \n\nThe friendship between Rachel Daly and Millie Bright is so tight and their dancing together are Trafalgar Square earlier was iconic. I know I\u2019m using the word icon a lot but it\u2019s the only work to describe this team.\n\n\n\n\n 2.35pm  \n\nOur very own Jonathan Liew was at Wembley yesterday and he wrote about the legacy the final could have. \u201cTomorrow arrived with a referee\u2019s whistle,\u201d he writes. \u201cAnd as England celebrated, the tableau that greeted us at Wembley would have been unthinkable even a few years ago. Women commentating on television. Women tapping away in the press box. Women officiating, women coaching on the touchline, women bellowing in the stands. Over the last few weeks these sights have become normalised because they are, in fact, normal. The crowds will disperse. The wall of noise will dissolve. But this legacy will remain: a nation slowly being rewired to expect different, to expect better.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n 2.30pm  \n\nJill Scott is putting 16 years of being in this England team into her celebrations and it\u2019s amazing. Have a look at this:\n\n\n\n\n 2.23pm  \n\nLucy Bronze reveals those glasses were necessary after the big celebrations last night. I can\u2019t get over how iconic she is, if she wins the World Cup with England next year she would have won everything there is to win in English football. WSL, Conti Cup, FA Cup, Champions League and the Euros already in the pocket. Alongside those French domestic titles and FIFA Best awards.\n\n\n\n\n 2.18pm  \n\nThe amount of sunglasses worn on stage is reflective of the hangovers from well deserved celebrations, have a look at this:\n\nAlso Rachel Daly was on the karaoke:\n\n\n\n\n 2.11pm  \n\nWhat a journey for Manchester City\u2019s Chloe Kelly, also how iconic is this photo:\n\n\n\n\n 2.05pm  \n\nWould you like a compilation of Beth Mead\u2019s six goals? Of course you would! I think my favourite Mead was her first against Austria. But if I had to pick a favourite England goal of the tournament I have to narrow it down to three. Stanway\u2019s against Spain, Russo\u2019s against Sweden and Toone\u2019s against Germany. What has been your favourite England strike or favourite of the tournament?\n\n\n\n\n 1.58pm  \nLionesses and manager Wiegman awarded Freedom of London\n\nThe Lionesses and manager Sarina Wiegman have been awarded the Freedom of London award and they\u2019ll pick up the honour later this year. Other people who have had the award include Florence Nightingale and Winston Churchill. Leah Williamson is also to have the Freedom of Milton Keynes.\n\n\nUpdated at 5.41pm BST\n\n\n 1.53pm  \n\nHere is the crowd in London, the players are in the mixed press zone now before heading off for some more partying:\n\n\n\n\n 1.51pm  \n\nGuardian columnist and former England star Anita Asante has said of the Lionesses\u2019 win:\n\n\n\n\n 1.47pm  \n\nGeorgia Stanway has spoken at the London celebrations and she is looking to build on what the Lionesses have started: \u201cLife\u2019s changed for the future generation. We\u2019ve definitely inspired a nation here today. We want people to jump on the bandwagon, we want people to fill them stadiums. We want people to stay with us because this is only the start.\u201d\n\n\n\n 1.43pm  \n\nOliver has emailed and he too is looking to be the Lionesses\u2019 beat mate: \u201cI\u2019m still on cloud 9 after living the best life at Wembley yesterday! As someone who similarly wants to be best friends with this England squad, any tips you receive would be greatly appreciated. Whilst you\u2019re with them, can you also ask how to get hold of one of those \u201cHome\u201d t-shirts? They\u2019re great!\u201d I think Nike could be selling the shirts, that is who has provided them for the players.\n\n\n\n 1.38pm  \n\nWe have a confirmed legend and icon in Jill Scott, the earlier reports are correct she has pulled an all nighter. She said: \u201cIt\u2019s worth it. I don\u2019t want to miss a moment and sleeping would be missing it wouldn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\n\n\n\n 1.32pm  \n\nAdrian has got in touch and said: \u201cAmong so many great moments was @Chloe_Kelly98 excellent tactical work in the top right hand corner of the field for most of the last 5 mins of extra time keeping possession at all costs.\u201d Completely agree, her game management was excellent yesterday as well as her winning goal.\n\n\n\n 1.27pm  \n\nFrom one great manager to another, Chelsea\u2019s Emma Hayes has spoken about Sarina Wiegman. \u201cShe is an amazing manager. It\u2019s the same sport, she just manages women rather than men at an extremely high level,\u201d Hayes told PA. \u201cI think some of the opinions in and around whether women could do that job are absolute nonsense. Of course she could do the job.\n\u201cI think it is time for a lot of things to be on more of an equal footing. Whether it is my niece only being able to play one football session in school, whereas the boys play three, or girls who are playing at the same level as the men on a fraction of their pay.\n\u201cFor me, there has to be an increase in investment across the game, and when it comes to coaching into the men\u2019s game it has to be a pre-requisite for successful teams. I think it is time for those changes to happen. You\u2019ve got to invest in not only free access for the kids, but also coaching, because seeing Sarina on the touchline last night I think is immense for any young girl who aspires to grow up being a coach. We need to invest in female coaches as well.\n\u201cI am super proud of Sarina. She is an an immense human being who carries the pressure so well and delivers in so many different ways. I\u2019m sure for her winning the title with her home nation was immense, but she realised last night how massive football is in this country. She is so humble, she is knowledgeable, she is wise and she is experienced, and most importantly, she is a fantastic person.\u201d \n\n\nUpdated at 1.28pm BST\n\n\n 1.21pm  \n\nThe players are leaving the stage now for what I\u2019m guessing is another day (or week) of celebrating. \n\n\n\n 1.20pm  \n\nSo here is a lovely fun fact for you. Sarina Wiegman is the first manager to lead two different nations to Euros glory. She has done so in style, not losing a single match.\n\n\n\n\n 1.17pm  \n\nHow can I become best friends with the entire England squad? Is that something that can be arranged? Also BBC 5 Live are reporting Jill Scott has pulled an all nighter, what an icon. The BBC coverage is over but Sky are still showing it, these players aren\u2019t leaving the stage any time soon.\n\n\n\n 1.13pm  \n\nWhat a mood Lucy Bronze is in Trafalgar Square:\n\n\n\n\n\n 1.06pm  \n\nThe momentum for women\u2019s football is huge, clear to see with 7,000 in Trafalgar Square to celebrate, so how does the sport capitalise on it?\n\n\n\n\n 1.00pm  \n\nThe broadcast is over but that celebration is going on into the afternoon! Alex Scott finished with a perfect sentiment, saying: \u201c#whocares, millions care. Millions. Like our captain Leah Williamson said, the tournament may be over but the journey has just begun.\u201d And I\u2019m crying again.\n\n\n\n 12.58pm  \n\nThe players and backroom staff have formed a line and are kicking their legs out. The arms are going in the air, their jumping and the whole Trafalgar Square are singing the iconic song. Lucy Bronze is loving this and Chloe Kelly is out for a solo dance. Millie Bright is on the mic signing along.\n\n\n\n 12.56pm  \n\nEvery player is now taking the opportunity to lift it, Wiegman lifts it to the biggest cheer. England fans definitely love their manager.\nWilliamson is back on the mic: \u201cDreams turn into reality. Hopefully there is a generation that is being inspired by us.\u201d Sweet Caroline is blaring on the speakers, here we go!\n\n\n\n 12.54pm  \n\nThe trophy is out on stage and the team are going to lift it in front of these supporters. Leah Williamson is doing the honours, the confetti canons go and the fans are raucous.\n\n\n\n 12.53pm  \n\nBeth Mead, Golden Boot and Player of the Tournament winner, said: \u201cI am so proud of being in this team. Sometimes football sucks, I worked hard and I feel so lucky to be part of this team. I am so happy to be here.\u201d\n\n\n\n 12.52pm  \n\nBronze, in skiing googles, tells BBC: \u201cI\u2019m feeling on top of the world, on top of Europe. Another trophy but the best one by far. There is still one more we can get our hands on next year.\nJill Scott adds: \u201cIt\u2019s been fantastic, to be part of this team. I\u2019m training with the best players in the world and it\u2019s so tough keeping up with them. I am so honoured to play any part in this team.\n\u201cEveryone who has put the shirt on, everyone who believed in women\u2019s football. We just wnated to be football, hopefully that is how it is perceived now around the world.\n\n\n\n 12.49pm  \n\nElla Toone, goalscorer in the final, said: \u201cIt took about ten minutes to go in the back of the net. It was the best feeling of the world, buzzing. I taught him [Harry Kane] that.\nChloe Kelly, the winning goalscorer, added: \u201cSo special to share this moment with an amazing bunch of girls. I\u2019m proud to wear this badge but I\u2019m even more proud to share the pitch with these players. I haven\u2019t stopped dancing, my feet just keep going.\n\n\n\n 12.47pm  \n\nWiegman tells the BBC: \u201cI\u2019m going back to my family, say hi to them. Have a little rest and then try to qualify for the World Cup.\u201d\nAnd Williamson added: \u201cThe legacy of the tournament was already made before the final. What we have done for women and young girls who can aspire to be us. England have hosted an incredible tournament and we have changed football across the country and the world.\u201d\n\n\n\n 12.46pm  \n\nWiegman adds: \u201cIt is so special. It is incredible. Everyone in the grey shirts [backroom staff] have done a really good job.\u201d\nLucy Bronze is such a mood in skiing googles.\n\n\n\n 12.45pm  \n\nWilliamson has spoken on her boss, she told the BBC: \u201cI think this is the missing ingredient England were looking for. She has brought us together. She is a special perosn, she puts us first as human beings.\n\u201cI think we have partied more than we have played football in the last 24 hours. It\u2019s incredible and to be able to share it with the people at the game and the country. I don\u2019t actually know what we have done, what have we done girls?! We were all pretty tired at full-time, we like to work hard but we like to party harder.\u201d\n\n\n\n 12.43pm  \n\nWiegman and Williamson have led the team out, they are in bucket hats with flags. I am a mess, the tears I have shed it over the last few days! \nWiegman said: \u201cI feel pretty good. Nice that you are all here. Thank you for coming. First of all they are very good football players, they are very good people. The willingness, the commitment, the resilience, The behaviour towards each other, the support has been incredible.\u201d\nBronze said of her boss: \u201cShe\u2019s got some good moves.\u201d\n\n\n\n 12.40pm  \nEngland players out at Trafalgar Square\n\n7,000 cheer and roar as the Lionesses emerge. What a moment for these players. Household names. Record breakers. Icons.\n\n\n\n 12.36pm  \n\nLucy Bronze has started a live story on Instagram, the players are preparing to come out to thousands of fans!\n\n\n\n 12.32pm  \n\nI hope you are all prepared for me to get VERY emotional as these celebrations get underway in London. A few minutes away from the players celebrating with their fans.\n\n\n\n 12.30pm  \n\nAbsolutely love this:\n\n\n\n\n 12.28pm  \n\nCoverage from Trafalgar Square begins at 12.35pm and I\u2019ll be taking you through it all. London mayor Sadiq Khan has already spoken in front of hundreds of fans: \u201cRecords have been broken. History has been made. This is a game changing moment.\u201d\n\n\n\n 12.26pm  \n\nI am crying again after reading this quote from It\u2019s Coming Home singer and comedian David Baddiel: \u201cWe talk about football, we just assume you mean men\u2019s football. Football is not default owned by men \u2013 that is something I think is only made clear very recently.\n\u201cIt\u2019s the same game, played by women or played by men. What\u2019s totally brilliant in the last few weeks is a sense that the country can get behind it in entirely the same way,. We\u2019ve won, not the women have won. We\u2019ve won.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n 12.22pm  \n\nChris has emailed about that potential handball and said: \u201cWhat sour grapes from the Germans who were lucky to have more than 9 players on the pitch at half time (Rauch + Oberdorf both committing multiple yellow card worthy fouls, mostly missed by a referee having a bad day at the office).\u201d\n\n\n\n 12.17pm  \n\nThis has absolutely cracked me up:\n\n\n\n\n 12.11pm  \n\nCan we speak about the tactical move of switching the taker of the corner yesterday. Chloe Kelly had stepped up to take the corner but Lauren Hemp came over and they switched. Hemp thundered it into the box and Kelly scored the winning goal. Masterclass.\n\n\n\n 12.06pm  \n\nOne player who I was heartbroken for yesterday was Alexandra Popp. She starred in her first Euros after injury prevented her from competing in 2013 and 2017 and she broke goal scoring records this year. She had to withdraw from the final after pulling a muscle in the warm-up, such a gutting way for her tournament to end.\n\n\n\n\n 11.59am  \n\nMary Earps, the keeper who conceded the least amount of goals in the tournament, everyone: \n\n\n\n\n 11.53am  \n\nElla Toone, who scored important goals against Spain and Germany, has said: \u201cI think a lot of people have fallen in love with women\u2019s football this summer. That\u2019s what we set out to do. So hopefully the crowds that we\u2019ve had this summer we can get into our grounds at club level and some more fans at the stadium to be on the journey with us.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n 11.47am  \n\nTony has got in touch, referencing the Frank Lampard ghost goal, and said: \u201cBecause England are always so lucky when they play Germany, right?\u201d\n\n\n\n 11.42am  \n\nSo was it a handball? From these pictures it definitely was.\n\n\n\nUpdated at 11.55am BST\n\n\n 11.35am  \n\nOur reporter Kate Connolly in Berlin has some insight into the German heartbreak: \nAs the German football team licks its wounds following its defeat at Wembley, at least some of the disappointment is being channelled into speculation as to whether the team was fairly treated, even maybe defrauded of victory. In particular there is discussion over whether the referees overlooked what is being referred to as a \u201cclear case of handball\u201d in the 25th minute of the match. Fury spills out of the tabloid Bild. Under the headline: \u2018Anger over the Scandal Referees\u2019 the paper writes, it was \u201cclear to see that the England player, Leah Williamson played the ball at shoulder height, with her hand\u201d.\nIt accuses the referee Kateryna Monzul, of failing to view it as a handball, whilst the video referees Paolo Valeri and Pol van Bockel, came to the joint conclusion that it was not a punishable move, \u201cSo they did not even check the scene!\u201d Bild declares.\nThe tabloid confronted Monzul about her decision after the match, with the question: \u201cWhat happened in the 25th minute with England\u2019s handball?\u201d Monzul, it said, \u201cshrugged her shoulders and stretched her arms out wide in an apologetic way and left. No explanation.\u201d \nThe tabloid then proceeded to confront Valeri after the end of the match in the Mixed Zone. His response, it said: \u201cNon posso dire niente, mi dispiace\u201d - or \u201cI can\u2019t say anything, I\u2019m sorry\u201d. Bild interprets this more bluntly in German as: \u201cSorry, I\u2019ve been muzzled\u201d.\nIt accuses British press of refusing to even discuss the issue.\nLater in a widely broadcast media interview, Germany\u2019s trainer Martina Voss-Tecklenburg, was also critical of the decision: \u201cAt this level in a final of the European Championships something like this should not happen,\u201d she said. \u201cI would like for there to be a discussion about this. But what I don\u2019t want is that it is overlooked.\u201d\nIn a separate commentary, Bild goes so far as to compare what it calls the \u201cfraudulent\u201d outcome, with the Wembley defeat of Germany\u2019s men to England at the 1966 World Cup.\nGermany is crying with our football women, and is annoyed about this new Wembley fraud! With this 1:2 defeat after an extension, we have been defrauded again almost 56 years after the scandal around the Wembley goal,\u201d it writes.\nSpiegel referred to the \u201ccommotion which reigned in connection with a hand ball\u201d which it said might have turned the game in Germany\u2019s favour. It quoted Voss-Tecklenburg as graciously saying that whilst Germany should have been granted a penalty kick, in her opinion, England was a worthy victor after the 120 minute match. \u201cThey played themselves into the hearts of many people,\u201d she said.\nDie Zeit said it was clear that the match \u201ccould have ended differently, had the referee, Kateryna Monsul, recognised Leah Williamson\u2019s handball in the 25th minute. According to the rulebook it should have led to a penalty kick, maybe even a red card. But neither the referee who is anyway normally rather overwhelmed, nor her video assistants wanted to admit they had seen anything. Which led to quite a discussion afterwards.\u201d\nMeanwhile, Germany is unsurprisingly already looking to next year\u2019s World Cup to get its revenge.\n\nUpdated at 11.36am BST\n\n\n 11.26am  \n\nOur very own Suzy Wrack is at Trafalgar Square for the celebrations of the Lionesses winning! The event will be live on BBC One at 12.35pm and there are a lot of people gathered already:\n\n\n\n\n 11.21am  \n\nIs there a more iconic pair than these two:\n\n\n\n\n 11.14am  \n17.4m people watched the Euro final in the UK and 17.897m in Germany\n\n17.4 million watched in the UK last night and it has now been reported 17.897 million watched in Germany. I\u2019d love to chat to someone who says no one cares about women\u2019s football ...\n\n\nUpdated at 5.40pm BST\n\n\n 11.09am  \n\nMagnus has reached out and he agrees with the German coach about the handball, he said: \u201cPopp out, wrong decision in the 25th min, should gave been a German penalty, VAR in this Euro was terrible. Lucky England, but you have to do it anyway.\u201d\n\n\n\n 11.05am  \n\nGermany manager Martina Voss-Tecklenburg says it \u201churts\u201d the referee didn\u2019t check the potential handball in the first half, she is convinced it was a penalty. \u201cFirst half, possession was better for England so they put more pressure on us, we got a few free-kicks that sometimes lacked courage, but we managed to have some attacks,\u201d she said. \u201cThere was a situation at 0-0 where there was a clear handball in the penalty area. The VAR looked but didn\u2019t award it. In such a game it\u2019s difficult to cope with that. Why didn\u2019t the referee look? That hurts a bit.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n 10.59am  \n\nTony has been in touch and suggested the Lionesses have a new celebration song: \u201cAfter the remarkable Williamson interview on the pitch after the game (well done Natalie Perks for just about holding it together, by the way) can England adopt the Who song \u201cThe Kids Are Alright\u201d?\u201d It\u2019s a great suggestion, I\u2019d love to see it.\n\n\n\n 10.55am  \n\nHave you seen anyone cooler than Rachel Daly?\n\n\n\n\n 10.50am  \n\nThe Lightning Seeds, David Baddiel and singer-songwriter-footballer Chelcee Grimes did a special concert on Saturday with former Lionesses including Anta Asante and Faye White. They performed the famous \u2018It\u2019s Coming Home\u2019 with new lyrics including England players names. Have a read of the lyrics below and a look at the performance. I really hope they release this as a separate song.\n\n\n\n\n\n 10.43am  \n\nCameron has got in touch and asked: \u201cIs there a \u2018curtain-raiser\u2019 match between the WSL champions and the Women\u2019s FA Cup winners?\u201d Chelsea won both competitions but I don\u2019t think there will be a one-off match between the Blues and another club ahead of the season start. \n\n\n\n 10.39am  \n\nThere has been a lot of discussion around how the FA\u2019s investment in the women\u2019s game has helped to produce the result last night. Sweden\u2019s goalkeeper Hedvig Lindahl agrees, tweeting \u201cshows that when you invest properly, the results come quick\u201d.\n\n\n\n\n 10.33am  \n\nIsn\u2019t captain Leah Williamson all of us right now?\n\n\n\n\n 10.28am  \n\nThank you John! Well did anyone get any sleep last night? I spent a good few hours sharing reels, stories and singing \u2018It\u2019s Coming Home\u2019, though there should be a new version with \u2018It Came Home\u2019 now. What a night and what a moment for English football. Get in touch with me via Twitter, @rendellx, or email to tell me all about your celebrations.\n\n\n\n 10.25am  \n\nSarah Rendell will be your guide from this point. I\u2019ll leave you with this video of the joyous post-match scenes on Sunday:\n\n\n\n\n 10.19am  \n\nThoughts inevitably will turn pretty quickly to the World Cup in Australia and New Zealand next year (the opening game kicks off in less than 12 months). Here\u2019s Lucy Bronze, speaking post-match on Sunday\n\nWinning a Champions League and FA Cups and stuff has always been amazing but a goal of mine has always been to win with England. And I would\u2019ve traded all those trophies previously for a night like tonight. So yeah, I\u2019m so proud of the fact we finally got our hands on a trophy but now we want to get our hands on a World Cup next year.\n\nEngland will certainly go into that tournament with momentum (though strictly speaking they haven\u2019t actually qualified yet). Usually the European champions have two years for the euphoria of victory to wear off but Wiegman\u2019s team have just one WSL season standing between them and the World Cup. And the double has been done before: Germany followed their European crowns in 2001 and 2005 with victory on the world stage in 2003 and 2007, while, more recently, the Netherlands reached the final in 2019 on the back of their 2017 European win.\n\n\n\n 9.55am  \n\nThe viewing figures for Sunday\u2019s final were pretty extraordinary:\n\nThat really does illustrate the progress made over the past decade or so \u2013 it\u2019s not that long ago that the BBC were scheduling an England Women\u2019s World Cup quarter-final on their red button service, initially preferring repeats of Porridge and Flog It! on their main channels.\n\n\n\n 9.49am  \n\nDavid Baddiel, one of the men to \n   <strike>\n     blame \n   </strike> thank for Three Lions (Football\u2019s Coming Home), said hearing the song sung at Wembley on Sunday was beautiful:\nHe told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme: \u201cIt\u2019s beautiful, it\u2019s fantastic. It was beautiful to hear it sung out at Wembley yesterday as we finally clinched a final - I really did think that would never happen.\n\u201cIt was so amazing to actually think: \u2018Oh, we won\u2019 \u2013 this doesn\u2019t happen. It\u2019s actually happened, and then the team all coming into the press conference and anarchically breaking [it] up by singing the song \u2026 it was just so brilliant, and so in the spirit of the Lionesses, which is kind of joyful and unbridled and brilliant, the way they play. So yes, I was very happy about it.\u201d\n\n\n\n 9.28am  \n\nThe FA\u2019s appointment of Sarina Wiegman really does have to go down as a masterstroke. Hope Powell\u2019s departure in 2013 after 15 years at the helm was always going to create something of a vacuum and after a couple of missteps they have finally got it right. There\u2019s an authoritative calmness about Wiegman\u2019s managerial style that complements the raw heart-on-sleeve energy of the squad and she found the right words after every match in the tournament. \n\n\n\n\n 9.11am  \n\nIt feels like there were umpteen iconic images to come out of Sunday\u2019s final. Here are just a few of them:\n\n\n\n\n 8.52am  \n\nEngland\u2019s 23-woman squad and head coach Sarina Wiegman have been awarded the Freedom of the City of London. Like failing to queue for buses and leaving your umbrella on the tube, it\u2019s one of the city\u2019s ancient traditions, going all the way back to 1237. Leah Williamson and co join such luminaries as Morgan Freeman, former England cricket captain Sir Alastair Cook, Annie Lennox, Helmut Kohl, Woodrow Wilson, Henry Winkler and Ed Sheeran in receiving the honour.\n\n\n\n 8.33am  \n\nThe Football Association\u2019s chief executive, Mark Bullingham, told the BBC on Monday morning that England\u2019s victory is a chance to \u201cturbo charge\u201d the development of the women\u2019s game:\n\n\u201cThe last few years have been incredible. We have invested really heavily and the Lionesses have taken their opportunity and they have produced something incredible. It\u2019s been an amazing month and an amazing day yesterday. I think it will really turbo charge everything we have been doing in the women\u2019s game. There is no reason why we shouldn\u2019t have the same number of girls playing as boys and it will inspire a whole new generation of players.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n 8.31am  \n\nHere\u2019s Peter Lansley on England\u2019s match-winner Chloe Kelly:\n\n\n\n\n 8.22am  \n\nHello all. And welcome to a world where an England football team are champions of Europe. \n\n\n\n\n 8.13am  \n\nBefore I sign off and hand you over to my colleague John Ashdown, and as talk turns to the future of women\u2019s football, here\u2019s a reminder, if one were needed, of the long road that has been trodden towards Sunday\u2019s seismic moment at Wembley. Bye for now.\n\n\n\n\n 8.03am  \n\n\u201cSo it wasn\u2019t a dream\u201d seems to be a recurring theme as people begin to wake up and feel the need to pinch themselves.\n\n\n\n\n 7.55am  \n\nJoin us as we delve deeper into the wonderful world of women\u2019s football through our weekly newsletter. It\u2019s informative, entertaining and global. It is also critical \u2013 when needed \u2013 and passionate. Sign up to Moving the Goalposts, the Guardian\u2019s weekly women\u2019s football newsletter, to keep reading about the game.\n\n\n\n 7.54am  \n\nLet\u2019s take a moment to savour a few snaps from a momentous night at Wembley. \n\n\n\n\n 7.41am  \n\nAmid all this English back-slapping, what of the poor Germany team? Their night was probably best summed up by an unfortunate incident even before a ball had been kicked at Wembley, when striker Alexandra Popp suffered a muscle injury in the warmup. Perhaps the writing was on the wall? \n\nAnd, as with most high-stakes football matches that must involve a winner and a loser, a sense of injustice pervades from the fallen, in this case over an incident in the 25th minute that I didn\u2019t see, honest. Marcus Hildebrandt has emailed in to remind me about it, anyway. \u201cHave a very close look at the 25th minute. Someone\u2019s hand is preventing a goal [for Germany], and it isn\u2019t the goalkeeper\u2019s!\u201d Marcus writes. \u201cNevertheless, congratulations!\u201d\nGerman tabloid Bild was less magnanimous, declaring: \u201cWe are cheated again.\u201d More reaction from Germany here:\n\n\nUpdated at 7.47am BST\n\n\n 7.28am  \n\nThe Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, has issued his congratulations to the Lionesses. \n\nI couldn\u2019t be more proud of the team today \u2013 they\u2019ve displayed extraordinary talent and determination throughout the tournament, they\u2019ve broken records, and now they\u2019ve made history. The atmosphere at Wembley and across the country throughout the tournament has been a fantastic advert for women\u2019s football. Nearly 600,000 tickets were sold for the matches and more than nine million people tuned in to watch England play. \nThe Women\u2019s Euro 22 will have inspired a new generation of women footballers and I hope this paves the way for better access to football for girls in school, more investment in grassroots girls and women\u2019s football and much more support for girls and women in all sports. \nI would like to thank Sarina Wiegman and the Lionesses for treating us to an amazing summer of football. I can\u2019t wait to see them lift the trophy again as they celebrate with the fans on Trafalgar Square on Monday.\n\n\n\n\n 7.23am  \n\nRob Collins has emailed in. \u201cHi Mike.\u201d Hi Rob. \u201cA stunning result that rewarded all those who believed. As a thank you, I would love to see the Lionesses do an open top bus parade in every town that hosted a game.\u201d Nice idea. Sheffield, Brighton, Southampton and Manchester stand by.\n\n\n\n 7.16am  \n\nOpportunity abounds and, writes Jonathan Liew, the future is bright:\n\nEngland won. In the end, perhaps that was the only thing that mattered...But of course it had to mean more than this. And as captain Leah Williamson hoisted the trophy aloft in her rainbow armband, in front of a record crowd and a television audience likely to be the highest ever for a game of women\u2019s football in Britain, it felt simultaneously like the end of one journey and the beginning of another. The first, an undying struggle for resources and respect, for parity and a platform, is finally complete. The second is a journey with no maps, no driver and no end in sight.\n\nMore here:\n\n\n\n\n 7.08am  \n\nSo how to capitalise on this incredible moment? Guardian football contributors Suzanne Wrack, Faye Carruthers, Louise Taylor, Sophie Downey and Jen Offord were asked for their thoughts. From launching a World Cup bid to a bold marketing plan, here they are:\n\n\n\n\n 7.00am  \n\nSunday\u2019s final attracted a record 87,192 fans to Wembley - the highest attendance of any European Championship final, men\u2019s or women\u2019s - to round off a record-breaking tournament in terms of in-person attendance. Interest in the women\u2019s game has never been higher and there seems to have been a shift in perception over the past couple of weeks.\nAs Carrie Dunn writes:\n\nFor the first time, plenty of this summer\u2019s coverage has been about technique and tactics, not just the players and their personal lives. Both male and female pundits have been analysing the games, and the mainstream media have been chatting about the results \u2013 which is also what\u2019s happened in workplaces around the country. It\u2019s everyday watercooler talk, the same as you\u2019d expect from any major men\u2019s tournament.\n\nRead Carrie\u2019s full article here:\n\n\n\n\n 6.47am  \n\nThe Queen said England\u2019s victory was \u201ca significant achievement\u201d, before adding that the England squad \u201cset an example that will be an inspiration for girls and women today, and for future generations\u201d.\nMeanwhile, English football royalty Sarina Wiegman stated six clear words after her side\u2019s win. \u201cMost of all, we changed society,\u201d the Dutch coach said. \u201cI think what we\u2019ve done is really incredible. I\u2019m so proud of the team. I think I need a couple of days to realise what we\u2019ve done.\u201d\nMore from Wiegman and her players here:\n\n\n\n\n 6.36am  \n\nWe can expect more scenes like this today, then.\n\nOf all the celebrations already seen though, this is quite possibly the best - the moment when the England players storm an unsuspecting Wiegman\u2019s post-match presser, singing and dancing to the tune of Baddiel and Skinner\u2019s anthemic Three Lions. Just glorious. \n\n\nUpdated at 6.50am BST\n\n\n 6.35am  \n\nPublic celebrations can continue on Monday with a daytime event scheduled at Trafalgar Square, where fans will be able to join a Q and A session with the victorious players and their manager, my colleague Gemma McSherry reports. Fans will be able to turn up and gain admission on a first-come, first served basis from 11am and the event will be broadcast on live on BBC One and BBC iPlayer from 12.40pm. \n\n\n\n\n 6.20am  \n\nEngland\u2019s \u201chistory makers\u201d obviously make both the front and back pages of this morning\u2019s UK papers, with plenty of predictable references in headlines to \u201ccoming home\u201d, \u201cyears of hurt\u201d and so on. Read them all here:\n\n\n\n\n 6.12am  \n\nWhere to start? How about with the views of the Women\u2019s Football Weekly podcast crew? Faye Carruthers, Suzanne Wrack, Ceylon Andi Hickman and Jonathan Liew got together in a Premier Inn room to digest the enormity of what they witnessed at Wembley - and what the future holds for the women\u2019s game. Take a listen here:\n\n\n\n\n 6.01am  \nPreamble\n\nIt\u2019s the sentence many thought they might never read again, but here we are: England have won a major football trophy. It\u2019s been a long 56 years since the nation\u2019s last title-winning side beat Germany in extra time at Wembley. This time around \u2013 against the same old foes, at the same north London venue and again after extra time \u2013 it was the women\u2019s team who made history and united the country in celebration.\nUnderstandably since the full-time whistle blew, reaction has been rather delirious. People danced the the Trafalgar Square fountains at full-time, there were wild celebrations in Manchester\u2019s fan zone, the players themselves gatecrashed a press conference and even the Queen got involved, offering her (slightly less unhinged) congratulations to Sarina Wiegman\u2019s team. The calls for an extra bank holiday to be granted are sure to be amplified today. \nI\u2019ll be here to take you through the early hours of the morning as the nation wakes up, a large proportion of which is quite possibly harbouring a sizeable hangover. Please do get in touch on mike.hytner@theguardian.com or on Twitter @mike_hytner, with any thoughts on the game, the newly-crowned European champions or the future of women\u2019s football.\n\n"

Hard to argue with that. Here\u2019s his report from the scene.    And you\u2019d have to say Dumfries was the man of the match. So that\u2019s it for me here. Thank you, thank you, thank you for following along here today and for the rest of the Cup. And enjoy curling season.  Updated at 8.47pm GMT    5.25pm    Alexander Cattermole is hopping mad: \u201cPulisic\u2019s set pieces created more opportunities for the Dutch than America. The insistence on using him on them should be grounds for a congressional investigation. MMA are flat track bullies who can dominate concacaf minnows but shrink when up against their supposed equals.\u201d David Konopka: \u201cPeter M has a strange memory with regards to the Bradley\u2019s. Bob last managed the US in 2011, when Michael was\u2026about 24 years old.\u201d Funny story: A US women\u2019s player whose NWSL team nearly brought in her father as an assistant insisted that such a situation was just fine because it worked for the Bradleys. Some fans would disagree.     5.23pm    Daniel Strauss: \u201cCan we finally get rid of this jumped up MLS coach and get a real national team manager, please?\u201d Richard Byrne: \u201cPhiladelphia Union coach Jim Curtin in.\u201d I\u2019ll let you two sort it out. How about Jesse Marsch?  Updated at 5.23pm GMT    5.22pm    Matt Turner says Berhalter said sometimes the game can be unfair. But he mentions that it\u2019s a result of what happened in both boxes.  \u201cWe conceded a third goal late, and that kind of took the steam out.\u201d And it wasn\u2019t their best defensive performance. \u201cWe were allowing balls into the box and not tracking runners. \u2026 It was a tough night overall defensively.\u201d Can you reflect on the positive moments, Fox\u2019s Jenny Taft asks. Not really. Not right now. The locker room is disappointed. (Well, the people in the locker room are disappointed.) And though it sounds negative, I think a lot of US fans will like that response. No reason they should be satisfied with this run. A lot of positives here, but it seems like these players aren\u2019t going to be complacent. Good for them.     5.19pm    A couple of readers take issue with Berhalter: Richard in Dallas: \u201cI\u2019m feeling bad for the USA - but this was no time to have defensive let downs..... What next for coach 3G? I feel good for LVG, though. He\u2019s a soccer weirdo, but, then, so aren\u2019t we on this MBM thread?\u201d     5.18pm    Peter Oh: \u201cI don\u2019t know the answer to your Fanta Orange question but based on what I saw in the last 90 minutes, a glass of Orange Crush has just been served up.\u201d I should point out, that even though I\u2019ve objected to some responses, that 90% of the email here has been wonderful, insightful and witty, as expected from readers of The Guardian.      5.14pm    Tyler Adams takes the softball questions: \u201cA game like that, it comes down to the margins. A team like that, you give them 3-4 chances, they\u2019re going to put them away. \u2026 We\u2019re moving in the right direction, but we need to keep pushing.\u201d \u201cWe still need to develop individually to be more mature players \u2026 a more experienced team got the better of us.\u201d Big mistake today, but the captain has shown remarkable class in this tournament.     5.12pm    Another comment from Liisa Sletzinger: \u201cFox commentators just said that the Netherlands has a date with Argentina. Actually, Argentina need to win their next match first. Sigh.\u201d In this Cup, you can\u2019t rule anything out!     5.12pm    Liisa Sletzinger was not impressed with Reyna and anyone else trying to dribble through three defenders. In fairness, the Dutch defense did a nice job clogging the passing lanes like their impressive engineering feats that keep the North Sea at bay. Dan Waters: \u201cFanta in USA is made with high fructose corn syrup. In Europe it\u2019s plain old sugar.\u201d Yes, and it\u2019s a huge difference.     5.09pm    Joshua L J Ashbee: \u201cHave to agree the Guardian sports blog has turned into a pro-USA parody of their normally fair mbm coverage.\u201d That\u2019s only because I don\u2019t speak Dutch. But I\u2019m not sure how much more credit I can give. The Netherlands finished their chances. Virgil played as expected. Noppert has wildly exceeded expectations.  Is it possible that some readers are simply anti-USA?     5.07pm    Gregg Berhalter hails the US effort. \u201cReally proud. When you think about this group, how they\u2019ve come together in the last three and a half years, you don\u2019t often get a bond like that.\u201d I don\u2019t think he\u2019ll be asked about the three big defensive lapses and lack of incisive passes that accounted for the final score.     5.06pm    Julian Menz on the last Dutch goal: \u201cAgain, it\u2019s down to naivety at the very top level. That was rank.\u201d     5.05pm    Charles Holzhauer: \u201cHey, Why don\u2019t you lay off this \u201csoccer\u201d obsession? I believe it was one of your own countrymen who observed that \u201ca rose by any other name\u2026.\u201d plus, isn\u2019t you people who put mayonnaise on your \u201cchips?\u201d Good God\u2026.\u201d I do love fish and chips. And English candy is far superior to American candy. Maybe I should stop by Pure Pasty today \u2026 But mayonnaise? Yeesh.     5.05pm    Kari Tulinius on the US goal: \u201cHaji Wright totally meant this. Either way, what a gloriously absurd goal.\u201d Absolutely. Beautiful backwards touch with the outside of the boot. Of course.     5.03pm    Peter M takes a broad view: \u201cI have thoroughly enjoyed their improvements (and undefeated record against England ;)), however, we have clear issues in our selection process. A lot of it, I believe, stems from marketability and for several years, we had a manager (Bob Bradley) who included his own son (Michael Bradley) in the selection for probably a few more years than he had been useful. The consequences of this tendency on our midfield cannot be understated. This year was definitely and improvement, but Having Gio Reyna ride pine, instead of play, is indefensible. The domestic league is improving - please - all nations, allow your washed up superstar to go so they can impart some in-game wisdom on our youth.\u201d Gareth Bale for the win.  And Yash Gupta responds: \u201cOkay so credit department - USMNT had a very good World Cup. But they remind me of a team called Tottenham which I follow. They\u2019re even wearing same kit. Shame for USMNT, this game is turning out like 2019 Champions League Final. That final was crap in quality but it felt so close at the same time. Italians can call Football whatever they want. Only moment of joy for them would\u2019ve been Germany getting out in consecutive group stages but they themselves missed both entirely. Calcio!\u201d Fair enough.     5.02pm    Mary Waltz: \u201cFirst of all, the US is not being humiliating. The Dutch might win but they will not be laughing at the end of this match and talking about how easy they had it. And the soccer controversy is so tired, played out, you are in a line of 10 million people who have been so proud of them selves for pointing out it should be called football. If you have a problem with soccer blame the people who coined the term, the brits.\u201d Matthew Schofield: \u201cTry trotting out the national team in, iirc, \u201885, on artificial turf in St Louis and going up against a T&amp;T side made up of part timers, and then losing, rather convincingly. This isn\u2019t in the top 100 embarrassing moments in the US soccer history.\u201d The US men went, off the top of my head, 11 years without winning a game in the 50s and 60s.     4.59pm    Shots: USA 17-11. Shots on target: USA 8-6. Possession: USA 58-42. Total passes: USA 564-412. You get the idea. OK, let\u2019s see what you wrote: James Robinson: \u201cI can\u2019t allow Mr Gupta\u2019s sentiments, and the extremely ungracious manner in which they were expressed, to pass unchallenged and I don\u2019t believe they are widely shared. It\u2019s good to see the USA at another finals and there\u2019s certainly no shame in losing to an excellent Netherlands team (if that\u2019s what happens).\u201d (This was obviously earlier in the game.) Richard McGahey on \u201csoccer/football\u201d: \u201cBrits used to use \u201csoccer\u201d and \u201cfootball\u201d interchangeably, research shows they started emphasizing \u201cfootball\u201d exclusively when USA started taking the sport more seriously. Also see Matt Busby\u2019s autobiography, \u201cSoccer at the Top: My Life in Football\u201d (real title).\u201d Matt Burtz adds: \u201cI wonder if the same vitriol is expressed for Australia\u2019s Socceroos, or is it merely saved for countries with populations over 330 million?\u201d Australia v Argentina later today.  Updated at 5.00pm GMT    4.55pm   Full time: Netherlands 3-1 USA  The final score is no reflection of how much terrific work the US did in this game. It is, however, a reflection of the superior professional edge the Dutch have. The US made, by my count, four mistakes in this game. The Netherlands scored three goals. You can\u2019t call that unfair. You can call it unfortunate. I\u2019m going to try to race through the mailbag before signing off.    Updated at 5.06pm GMT    4.53pm    90 +5 min: The Dutch defense is still holding, clearing every cross. They\u2019re no longer sending more than one player forward to counter. It\u2019s all defense now. And as I say that, it\u2019s 3v3 the other way.     4.52pm    90 +4 min: Cross to Morris, can\u2019t control, ends up back to Musah for a shot from 18, blocked by Virgil! Berhalter misplays the ball to Reyna. Yes, Berhalter. The coach tried to kick it back to him for a quick throw-in. That kind of day.     4.51pm    90 +3 min: Musah beats his man and crosses from the right side again. It\u2019s cleared again. Subs, with the Dutch jogging off slowly: Gakpo and Ake out. Weghorst and de Ligt in.     4.50pm    90 +2 min: Dutch subs warming up, but now it\u2019s Pulisic on the run, cut back to Musah, dangerous cross to Morris headed clear. Zimmerman and Adams stop the Dutch counter.     4.49pm    90 +2 min: Morris on for Robinson. Forward for defender. Going for broke. I\u2019m saying 4-1 final now.   Updated at 4.52pm GMT    4.48pm    90 min: Long attack for the Dutch, and the basic problem for the US is that the Netherlands can have a prolonged, dangerous attack with only three players while everyone else hangs back to surround Reyna and Pulisic. We\u2019ll play six more minutes. Surprised it\u2019s not nine.     4.47pm    89 min: US wins possession. Musah crosses, headed clear. Reyna again is surrounded as if bathing in Fanta Orange. Why is Fanta Orange so much better in Europe than in the US?     4.46pm    88 min: Reyna tries to find space. There is none. The Dutch go off to the races. The US recovers, Now, at last, the Dutch start possessing the ball.     4.45pm    87 min: Tactical foul by de Jong on Aaronson, duly punished with a yellow card. Jordan Morris is about to come in. That\u2019s not going to intimidate anyone.     4.44pm    86 min: The corner kick is nodded down and bounces slightly up, and Zimmerman tries the world\u2019s clumsiest seated bicycle kick. Why not?     4.44pm    86 min: We\u2019re getting some time-wasting now, so stoppage time will last an eon. I actually think a fourth Dutch goal is more likely than a second US goal, but I\u2019ve been wrong many, many times in this Cup. Pulisic with a wonderful ball forward to Wright, and Virgil has to be absolutely perfect to play it out for a corner.     4.42pm    85 min: Now the Dutch fans are dancing.  You could say this game has been unfortunate, that the US haven\u2019t seen a just reward for their play in this game. But they\u2019ve made mistakes, and the Dutch have punished them. Three times \u2013 all when the US was in the ascendancy.     4.40pm   GOAL! Netherlands 3-1 USA (Dumfries 81)  Oh, what a lapse. And a deserved goal for the superb Dumfries, who took advantage of Robinson\u2019s wandering toward the middle. Blind sees him, crosses over everyone in the middle of the box, and Dumfries takes it well with his left foot. No chance for Turner. That\u2019s three extraordinarily costly mistakes for the US. And three superb finishes. Yes, I\u2019m using \u201csuperb\u201d a lot. I\u2019m running out of words.   Updated at 4.43pm GMT    4.38pm    80 min: Corner kick for the US. They have not been dangerous on these, but the crowd roars. Can Pulisic get his third assist of the Cup? Nope \u2013 Noppert claims. The Dutch keeper has been superb, beaten only by a bizarre touch that looped over him.     4.37pm    78 min: CHANCE! Noppert was uncapped before this Cup, and he has saved the Netherlands several times now, this time with a sliding tackle far out of his box to take the ball from Wright, who was somehow left alone!  This has become insane. Margriet Krijgsman: \u201cWhy are you so pro USA? I am a big donor of Guardian BECAUSE they report if not neutrally at least realistically, and fair at all times. Do you secretly work for USA Today? I am sick of your evident preference for the US. I would be equally throwing up if you were so blatantly kow towing to the Dutch.\u201d No, I worked for USA Today from 1999 to 2010.  But to reiterate \u2013 the Dutch have finished clinically. The US have not. Fair play to them. And Noppert will surely earn a BIG payday after this.     4.35pm    77 min: Yedlin has replaced Dest. Might hurt the attack a bit, but ..     4.34pm   GOAL! Netherlands 2-1 USA (Wright 76)  Who needs clinical finishes? The US will take a weird looping touch off a great Pulisic cross that Wright somehow scuffs into the air and over everyone. Game on? Game on!    Updated at 4.40pm GMT    4.33pm    75 min: CHANCE on a rare blunder by the Netherlands! A backpass finds Haji Wright, who ends up one-on-one with Noppert. His touch goes wide, and his tight angle shot is cleared.     4.32pm    74 min: Reyna tries an off-balance shot and hits his head in the process. Colum Fordham: \u201cThe USA have been lively and shown sparks of good football (or soccer) \u2013 I did like Weah Junior\u2019s volley \u2013 but Netherlands have been been more clinical. As an Englishman who idolised Johan Cruyff, I admit to a certain bias in favour of the Dutch but the USA have played pretty well in this tournament. A young enthusuastic team playing decent soccer but being outplayed when it comes to football.\u201d Looks like the experienced DeAndre Yedlin will soon appear. Maybe Robinson just can\u2019t continue?     4.31pm    72 min: DOUBLE SAVE from Turner, and while the flag went up shortly afterwards, who knows what VAR would\u2019ve said. Turner parries a hard shot from Koopmeiners, then immediately scrambles to knock aside a headed follow-up from Memphis. A few seconds later, he races out to collect a dangerous ball. Hard to imagine anyone whose stock has improved more in this tournament than Turner, even if he hasn\u2019t been the busiest of keepers.   Updated at 4.34pm GMT    4.29pm    71 min: Corner kick for the Dutch, Virgil heads over. I\u2019ve been waiting to get to this one from Lennert Beurskens: \u201cIt seems like Van Gaal has (rightly) decided that we do not have the attacking nor midfield players to play the famed dominant Dutch Total Football against top teams. However, we do have some world class defenders, so the plan seems to be to play a sort of catenaccio counter attacking game. Hard to watch but so far extremely efficient. Best regards from the Netherlands.\u201d     4.28pm    70 min: The US now leads in final third entries 34-14. But the Dutch efforts just look so much better. Zimmerman has been superb. Sorry I doubted you. Robinson, who has shaken off his injury, makes a vital tackle.     4.27pm    68 min: Long stoppage there, for which the referee will surely compensate with 15 minutes after we play 90. I exaggerate. I hope. Zimmerman safely plays it out to stop the onrushing Dutch. Aaronson fouls Timber. Barely. \u201cPersistent infringement,\u201d fyi, does not necessarily mean the same player committing all the fouls, and the next player who breathes on Pulisic should be sent to Dubai.     4.25pm    65 min: SUBS, but Robinson is down, and this might hold things up. Haji Wright, the closest thing to a traditional No. 9 on this squad, is ready to go, as is Aaronson, an industrious Leeds United teammate of Adams. Will Berhalter need to replace Robinson instead? Would Berhalter gamble with three at the back? No, surely not. Robinson looks like he\u2019ll continue. So it\u2019s Wright and Aaronson in for a disconsolate Weah and McKennie, the latter of whom was injured before the Cup and hasn\u2019t been able to go 90.     4.22pm    63 min: Robinson stops Dumfries at one end, and the Dutch think it\u2019s a penalty. It\u2019s not. Both players are hurt, but we still go to the other end, where Pulisic sets up a chance for Weah that\u2019s blocked. Back the other way briefly, but then it\u2019s back to the US, where Pulisic probably should\u2019ve fallen to draw a foul but instead keeps playing and oh my goodness would this game calm down so I can catch my breath because it\u2019s still unlikely that the US will claw back two goals.  Updated at 4.23pm GMT    4.20pm    61 min: CHANCE as the Dutch break out. Robinson recovers well. There\u2019s a scramble, and Memphis ends up forcing Turner to palm it over the bar. I think it was going high. On the corner, Turner fails to collect, but that\u2019s because he was fouled. I see so much email coming in. My apologies for not getting to it.     4.18pm    60 min: Free kick is cleared easily, as all US set pieces are. Then, oh my, a BRUTAL foul on Pulisic by the substitute Koopmeiners. That\u2019s a yellow card, and it was absolutely cynical.     4.17pm    58 min: Game has gone quiet. Gupta responds: \u201cYeah yeah Soccer word has its origin. But it doesn\u2019t include neither foot nor ball, head, shoulder, chest, buttocks, crotch.\u201d Is that a reference to the Pulisic injury?  Oh, and he\u2019s just been fouled again. Kick to the shins by Virgil. Anyway, the Italians call it \u201ccalcio.\u201d Go pick on them.     4.16pm    56 min: Weah has space in the middle, but the ball is headed clear. There will be so many \u201cwhat ifs\u201d after this game.     4.13pm    53 min: CHANCE with McKennie shooting over the bar, set up brilliantly by Reyna. Also, for Yash Gupta: Going 0-3 in the 1998 World Cup, with a loss to Iran and tawdry off-field issues, is humiliating. Failing to qualify for the 2018 tournament is humiliating. This? If you think this is humiliating, I sentence you to watch the Houston Texans. Or read my book. Whichever is more painful.   Updated at 4.20pm GMT    4.11pm    52 min: Pulisic with a nice touch to create some space. His 18-yard shot is right at Noppert. Credit Gakpo, incidentally, with that save off the line for the Dutch on the Ream shot.     4.10pm    51 min: Wow. End to end. Imagine if the score was 1-1 or 2-1.  Anyway, back to Gupta: \u201cSoccer\u201d is an English word derived from \u201cassociation football\u201d back when one group of Englishmen wanted to tackle each other and another wanted to kick each other.     4.09pm    50 min: CHANCE at the other end, and it\u2019s a save by Matt Turner. Would\u2019ve been an own goal for Zimmerman, but it was a vital intervention.     4.08pm    49 min: CHANCE cleared off the line as the ball falls to Ream on a corner, and the least likely US player to score nearly does so but can\u2019t get much oomph at close range in tight space.    Updated at 4.12pm GMT    4.07pm    48 min: Ball is stuck in midfield while Louis van Gaal gestures about something. Zimmerman and Ream cope very well with a Dutch attack here:  I\u2019m going to argue with Yash Gupta: \u201cFrom what I\u2019ve understood, okay not so much, you\u2019re more likely to do MBM if USMNT is playing in a World Cup. If that\u2019s the case then it was a fun ride which unfortunately will end today with a humiliating defeat for USA. Not that I\u2019m complaining. Anyone who calls a sport which is played with every body part except \u2018arms\u2019 Soccer, and actual game which is played with throwing ball with hands Football deserves nothing more.\u201d Just wait for my curling end-by-end.     4.05pm    47 min: It\u2019s been noted that the last time the US came back to win from two goals down was in a 2015 friendly against \u2026 the Netherlands. I think some of the US players were in middle school then.      4.04pm    46 min: A long throw-in from McKennie, and Noppert has to punch clear of Zimmerman. The best set piece from the US so far in this Cup is \u2026 a throw-in. Go figure.     4.04pm    Subs \u2026 GIO REYNA IS IN! He\u2019s replacing Ferreira. The Dutch have two subs: Teun Koopmeiners replaces Davy Klaassen. Steven Bergwijn replaces Marten de Roon. The US had 63% of possession in the first half. Japan, which barely had the ball but won its group finale, laughs. We\u2019re back on.   Updated at 4.05pm GMT    4.03pm    Is this what the Dutch wanted?  Fred Decker says what several correspondents are saying right now: \u201cMy impression, fwiw, is that the Dutch are choking the life and flow out of the game and hoping that the young, energetic American squad will make mistakes as they grow more frustrated. It\u2019s not pretty, but van Gaal has been around long enough to know that getting the win is all that counts.\u201d     4.02pm    Andy Gordon: \u201cWhether \u2018a kick in the knees\u2019 is equivalent to \u2018a kick in the shins\u2019, \u2018a kick in the Pulisics\u2019 seems appropriate and \u2018a kick in the Netherlands\u2019 should cover everything.\u201d I think Denzel Dumfries is the bees\u2019 knees. I\u2019ve never understood that expression.     4.01pm    Tactics, technique Peter Rehwaldt: \u201cIt seems as if a fair number of the US passes are going to where a receiving player IS, rather than where they are heading. Sometimes it means the pass misses completely (a cross that runs behind three attackers), and other times it means the receiver has to stop and wait for it (some of the midfield passes). Either way, passes like that stop any kind of momentum and movement.\u201d Peter Oh notes Dumfries, the man with two assists for the Dutch: \u201cThis might be the best Denzel performance I\u2019ve seen on an American big screen since Fences.\u201d I\u2019m partial to the scene in The Equalizer in which Denzel beats up all the yuppies. Wow, the mail is flooding in \u2026     3.59pm    The two best players for the US in this World Cup have been Christian Pulisic and Tyler Adams, and Sergi\u00f1o Dest has a claim to be the third best. All three have had crucial mistakes today. I don\u2019t really blame Pulisic for failing to put away that chance. But his corner kick service was terrible, and he\u2019s had a couple of wayward passes. Adams simply lost Memphis on the first Dutch goal. And Dest lost Blind. And the US is \u2026 well, not lost, but this is a mountain to climb.      3.52pm    In the past, the US would\u2019ve come out timidly for a game like this.  What we\u2019ve seen in this Cup is a team attacking like demons and pinning back their opponents. They\u2019re not just doing it to some Concacaf also-ran or Iran. They\u2019ve done it to England and now the Netherlands. That\u2019s undoubtedly a sign of progress. If only there could be some combination of this possession panache and either a Tab Ramos in midfield or a Brian McBride up front. Mailbag after refreshment \u2026      3.49pm   Halftime: Netherlands 2-0 USA  What a misleading scoreline that is. But the Dutch finished their two chances, neither of which Matt Turner could\u2019ve stopped, and the US chances just weren\u2019t quite good enough, both well saved by Noppert. Coming up, my take on US progress \u2026   Updated at 3.54pm GMT    3.48pm   GOAL! Netherlands 2-0 USA (Blind 45+1)  We only have one minute of stoppage time, and it\u2019s too long for the US. Dumfries works on the right, barely has space to get in a cross, but Blind races onto it and slams it home. Dest, for all his great work at the other end, just lost him.    Updated at 3.50pm GMT    3.47pm    45 min: Breathtaking end-to-end action! Dest drives into the box on a solo run and just has it poked away. Gakpo races the other way and outruns Ream, but Robinson tracks back well.     3.46pm    44 min: Fifa\u2019s stats say the US has outcrossed the Netherlands 16-5 but only completed 2 to the Netherlands\u2019 1,     3.45pm    43 min: CHANCE! Weah absolutely blasts it from 22 yards out and stings Noppert\u2019s hands as the big Dutch keeper reacts well.  The replay shows how perfect his technique on that bouncing ball really was.     3.44pm    42 min: Now I\u2019m wondering if Pulisic is feeling the effects of his injury. Another good combination, and Ferreira contributes well this time, and it breaks down when Pulisic\u2019s pass to the left wing is far off target. Weah in particular is starting to look industrious. The son of one of the greatest players to never play in a World Cup is a good player, and \u2026.     3.42pm    40 min: So whom would you like to see come on for the US at halftime? Reyna for incisive passes? Haji Wright for a pure striker? Brenden Aaronson just because? Pulisic gets felled by Timber. Referee sternly warns him that he can only do that 18 more times.     3.39pm    38 min: Very nice combination work down the left. The US can\u2019t get a shot out of it, but if they\u2019re able to do that 40 more times in this game, it\u2019ll surely work once. Then it\u2019s another bad touch from Ferreira.      3.38pm    37 min: Surprising news from Matt Schofield: \u201cSo i was settling in to watch the game, here in my home in Berlin, when I realized they are not broadcasting it. There have actually been quite a few games this year that have not been shown, which is shocking compared to everything through 2018. Anyway, long way of saying thanks for the minute by minute. You are my only hope (guess the movie reference?).\u201d Jedi Robinson surely appreciates.     3.38pm    35 min: Robinson finds Ferreira, who has a chance to pass it to McKennie or Pulisic but does neither.  Gio Reyna isn\u2019t a striker, either, but would he help unlock this Dutch three- or four- or five-man defense? Berhalter has not been making good adjustments at halftime. The US has outplayed all three opponents in the first half by a wide margin. The second halves \u2026 well \u2026     3.36pm    34 min: McKennie hustles to keep the ball in play on the Dutch end line.  Sergei Nirenburg: \u201cNice to see the US show enthusiasm and technique.But so far it\u2019s boys against men, methinks.\u201d I don\u2019t have the stats in front of me to quantify it, but this a very young US team. Bodes well for 2026, perhaps.  Richard McGahey: \u201cDutch playing 5 man back line when we attack, dropping wingbacks back outside tight three central defenders, slows us way down and hard to penetrate\u201d Yeah, the difference between a 3-5-2 and a 5-3-2 is more one of attitude or a game situation than anything else.      3.34pm    33 min: Now no one\u2019s in the attacking third. I like this comment from Walter Haugen: \u201cGreetings - I live in France now but I am from the US and used to coach and referee youth soccer in the 1990s. I used to make a distinction with my players about the difference between a forward and a striker. A forward shoots on goal. A striker finishes. This is appropos of your comment that the US has the combination but cannot get the final pick in. Or get the final number. Whatever.\u201d The lack of a No. 9 has been an issue here, especially with Ricardo Pepi left off the roster and Jesus Ferreira not playing until today, where he doesn\u2019t seem to be shaking off the rust. Josh Sargent, unavailable today due to injury, did OK in that role.  But what wouldn\u2019t the US give for a Brian McBride right now?     3.32pm    29 min: Corner hits a gaggle of heads, and it\u2019s judged to have gone off a US head last.  Zimmerman cleanly wins the header on the next one, and the Dutch manage only a wild pass attempt to keep it there. Pressure off for now. USA lead 15-5 in final third entries, the stats say. Replay of the goal shows Adams is the one who didn\u2019t catch Memphis, but should someone else have been there? Hard to say.      3.29pm    28 min: Steady as she goes. Ruth Purdue on tactics: \u201cLooks like the Dutch are man marking in central areas when out of possession. Following their players a lot in there.\u201d Joe Pearson: \u201cThe midfield does not react fast enough when we lose possession.\u201d Perhaps so. Maybe the US is too reliant on Adams?  Zimmerman pokes a ball away for a corner.     3.28pm    26 min: So often, a goal livens up a game. This one seems to have stopped it dead in its tracks. The US is comfortably knocking the ball around in midfield but can\u2019t find a way through. Are the Dutch \u2026 bunkering? Adam K has a tactical observation: \u201cFascinating and engaging game so far. One thing I\u2019m liking (and one thing that the USA don\u2019t seem to have caught on to yet) is that de Jong is dropping into the back line to form a back 4, kind of like he and van de Beek would do at Ajax. It feels like that\u2019s really throwing the USA midfield and allowing de Jong to dictate from deep -- but the USA are looking bright and speedy up front, specifically down the wings, and that\u2019s causing problems for a slightly aged Dutch back line. It\u2019s tantalisingly poised! Enjoy the match and cheers for doing the MBM.\u201d   Updated at 3.31pm GMT    3.25pm    24 min: More combinations here from the US, but they keep forgetting the last number to pick the lock. Or something like that. Someone asked whether \u201ca kick in the knees\u201d is a US idiom, but I said that instead of \u201ckick in the shins\u201d because players wear shin guards. Often very small one. Why do they do that? Our officials today are Brazilian. The man in the middle is Wilton Sampaio.     3.23pm    21 min: Memphis rushes a shot from a bad angle. Gregg Berhalter is chatting with the fourth official about an offside call that the commentary team believes was a mistake because a defender played it. As a referee myself, I .. was looking at my keyboard. But I will say Pulisic was just fouled, even if our referee disagrees. I\u2019ll check in on referee discussions as I have time. Which I don\u2019t.     3.22pm    20 min: Richard McGahey quibbles with my take that we\u2019re being cynical here, insisting that you can\u2019t give the Dutch an inch or give Memphis an uncontested shot there. And yeah, he\u2019s not wrong. I wouldn\u2019t say the press as a whole has had no effect, though. In fact, I think the danger in pressing forward all the time is that players may sometimes forget to track everyone on the way back, and Tyler Adams can\u2019t be everywhere. As I type, US pressure forces Noppert to play too quickly for his tastes, and the US claims the ball in midfield.     3.19pm    17 min: Robinson makes a run into the box, but there\u2019s just no passing lane. I think it might be a tad harsh on Pulisic to call his shot a \u201cmiss.\u201d I recall people saying that after the great German keeper Oliver Kahn made an terrific save on Landon Donovan in 2002. Pulisic had little time to shoot, and Noppert made a terrific save.      3.18pm    16 min: US still possessing. The Dutch players look like they\u2019ve figured things out and might be able to get through on the counter. Mary Waltz: \u201cPulisic should talk to Lukaku. You can\u2019t miss when you get a chance. Pulisic missed, Memphis didn\u2019t. Sad fact for my eagles. The US has never won a WC match when giving up the first goal.\u201d     3.16pm    14 min: Tyler Adams takes a forearm to the face from Dumfries and checks his teeth. Look, you can set up a goal, but leave Adams alone, \u2018k?     3.15pm    13 min: Pulisic again has a chance to cross, but the Dutch players outnumber the US players this time, and the ball goes back the other way. Richard McGahey: \u201cSome US player trailing Depay didn\u2019t rush to catch up with him so much for the press and intensity.\u201d Man, we are cynical in this country these days.     3.13pm   GOAL! Netherlands 1-0 USA (Depay 10)  With good teams, sometimes, you just need one chance. Good passes through midfield. The first touch from Dumfries on the right is played back to Memphis, to use his preferred name, at the top of the box, and he rips it into the net. A thing of beauty for the neutral. A kick in the knees for the US.    Updated at 3.16pm GMT    3.11pm    9 min: Finally, the Dutch get into the attacking third, but the possession is brief.  Now de Jong is racing back and forth with the ball in his own box because Ferreira isn\u2019t letting him play it out easily.     3.10pm    8 min: Well, that\u2019s better from Pulisic. He races down the left and puts in a dangerous cross for Weah that\u2019s headed clear. Then the magnificent Tyler Adams quickly wins the ball as the Netherlands try to get into the attacking third with purpose for the first time in the match.     3.09pm    7 min: Robinson races up the left side and forces a tackle out for a corner. Such a pest, this Jedi.  Pulisic\u2019s corner kick sails over the box like a plane flying over Arthur Ashe Stadium. Two big touches from Pulisic so far that haven\u2019t been the best, to be honest.     3.07pm    6 min: Still the US pressing. Weah gets the ball in the box but can\u2019t turn and has to play it back out.  Put a pin in this. I have something profound to say at halftime. Well, hopefully profound. It\u2019ll be a broad comment on US soccer history.     3.06pm    4 min: Virgil van Dijk casually shields the ball out of play. Dest practically climbs around him in an effort to get it. Didn\u2019t keep it in play, but the message is clear here \u2013 NOTHING will be easily given to the Netherlands today.      3.04pm    3 min: CHANCE! Dest\u2019s cross is headed away, but the ball comes back to Pulisic in the middle of the box, and Noppert has to use all of his long legs to keep it out.   Updated at 3.10pm GMT    3.03pm    2 min: Noppert\u2019s touch 90 seconds ago was the last substantial touch by a Dutch player. US knocking the ball around.     3.02pm    1 min: Noppert seems a little casual playing the ball while US players buzz around him. The press is on.     3.01pm    Email right now has two major themes: More talk of music to play after the game, depending on results, and those of us who remember when we were all called rude things for playing or watching soccer.  Brian McBride changed the image of soccer by bleeding. A lot. In 2006, after an elbow in the Italy game busted open his face. That made people realize this \u2026 \u2026 we\u2019ll pick this up later. Kickoff.     2.59pm    Twitter The one-time great hope of the nation is still a great supporter \u2026  Many scenes like this \u2026  Christian Pulisic actually looked kind of relaxed while singing the anthem. They looked pumped up to play. Would you expect less?     2.55pm    Predictions Before the Cup, I posited that the US men had a terrifying attack but a defense that terrified its own fans. So \u2026 I was kinda wrong. The US has scored only twice, with both goals involving Pulisic. But the defense has conceded only once, a penalty kick after a rash tackle by Zimmerman.  Then I said Iran would probably get a draw with the US. But, I figured, if the US scored in the first half, they\u2019d force Iran to come out of its bunker and many goals would be scored. In other words, I\u2019m the wrong person to ask. The Fox commentators are all-in on the US. Landon Donovan says it goes to PKs (I\u2019m sorry \u2013 are we allowed to say \u201cPK\u201d without being compared with Ted Lasso?), while Clint Dempsey sees a US win outright, and Alexi Lalas shouts \u201c2-0\u201d and practically stage-dives, Fishbone-style, into the pit of US fans behind the set.     2.51pm    Back to music for our DJ friend \u2026 Joe Pearson suggests Neil Diamond\u2019s America and inquires about my substitute teaching gig this week. I missed a lot of soccer but very much enjoyed it, thanks. Kari Tulinius says to go with Prince. Fox, meanwhile, is playing Miley Cyrus\u2019 Party in the USA. Also in the mailbag, Jim Brockton is pretending he hasn\u2019t heard of the college that UNC beat in last year\u2019s Final Four but has won five national men\u2019s basketball championships, the first in my senior year. (Yes, I\u2019m old.)     2.48pm    More mailbag \u2026 I have corrected the text lineup below that mentioned Pulisic twice. Apologies to Tim Weah. Fellow curler Alan MacNeill would like Fox to back up just a bit: \u201cI realize soccer is a metaphor for war, and has even caused international conflict....but can we get fox to dial down the patriotic rhetoric down to a 6-7 vs the 13 we are at right now? It\u2019s only the round of 16...I\u2019m half expecting if we made the semis or finals a dance line of rifle wielding cheerleaders shooting random things.\u201d Proof that we\u2019re still, at heart, a \u201cNFL and the US Army\u201d country.     2.45pm    How big is the sport now in the US? Dave Hanratty: \u201cGreetings from Ireland \u2013 I\u2019ve always enjoyed cheering on USA in World Cups, likely because of USA \u201894 being the first proper World Cup I experienced and Ireland\u2019s exciting run in it. That, and I do get a kick out of ostentatious American football/soccer commentary and so on. I was wondering if you could shed some light on just how respected the beautiful game is or isn\u2019t in the US in 2022? For a long time it seemed like it was dismissed as a \u2018girl\u2019s game\u2019 or some other sexist nonsense, but there seems to be, year on year, a notable uptick in football being taken more seriously over there? Same time, it\u2019s never ever going to eclipse baseball, basketball, or American football, right? Just looking to take the overall temperature, really. Best of luck today!\u201d I\u2019m a substitute teacher in local schools because I\u2019m a freelance journalist and therefore someone who needs side hustles (and because I enjoy it). I\u2019ve been amazed this year to see how much excitement there is. I walked by a classroom and heard USA-Iran emanating from their big screen. Kids are walking around in Pulisic shirts.  At the very least, the hostility toward soccer is dying out. But I literally wrote the book on why the US has a low ceiling in this sport. No gratuitous plug here (Google the book if you like). But to sum up: We have a great fan base, and we always manage to get in our own way with things like lawsuits. Story on one of those coming up soon, maybe in a week or two. But forget the pessimism for now. There has never been a better time to be a soccer fan here. We used to be underground. Now we rule.     2.41pm    Douglas Gibson guesses wrong: \u201cGreetings from a UNC alum! You went to NC State, I take it? Anyway, thanks to you and the rest at the Guardian team for great safe-for-work World Cup coverage. I wouldn\u2019t go anywhere else.\u201d No, I went to UNC\u2019s biggest rival in UNC\u2019s biggest sport other than women\u2019s soccer. (And occasionally victorious over UNC in that sport, too. Apologies to my fellow National Soccer Hall of Fame veterans committee member Anson Dorrance.)     2.38pm    Lineup talk \u2026 First, a simple text version by request: USA Goalkeeper: Matt Turner Defenders: Antonee Robinson, Tim Ream, Walker Zimmerman, Sergi\u00f1o Dest Midfield: Tyler Adams, Weston McKennie, Yunus Musah Forward: Christian Pulisic, Jesus Ferreira, Tim Weah Netherlands Goalkeeper: Andries Hoppert Defenders: Jurrien Timber, Virgil van Dijk, Nathan Ake Midfield: Daley Blind, Frenkie de Jong, Marten de Roon, Denzel Dumfries, Davy Klassen Forward: Memphis Dupay, Cody Gakpo The graphic is a little odd anyway, says Nick White: \u201cRegarding the US Lineup tweet...Do they always blow up player\u2019s heads like that and I haven\u2019t ever realized, or is that photoshop job of Dest uniquely terrible. His head is frightfully out of proportion with his body.\u201d Now a question from Rahul Vanamali: \u201cSurely there\u2019s something going on behind the scenes between Berhalter and Reyna - can\u2019t imagine why a player of Reyna\u2019s skill has seen such limited game time with no obvious injury concerns, unless I missed something...Does anyone have anything?\u201d Berhalter has been treading a line between brilliance and consternation. Bringing back Tim Ream was clearly a stroke of genius. The substitutions have been \u2026 odd. Surely the US would\u2019ve been better off with Reyna holding the ball at the end of the Iran game instead of Haji Wright.  Updated at 2.52pm GMT    2.31pm    I\u2019m also a fan of the music YouTuber Todd in the Shadows, who contributes this:   Yeah, but Arby\u2019s got rid of their potato cakes, so \u2026     2.30pm    David Walls disagrees with my assessment of the US national anthem: \u201cIt might not be quite up there with the Marseillaise (the obvious winner in the World Cup of Anthems) but I think the Star Spangled Banner is a contender to make the last eight at least (especially in the absence of Russia and Italy this time). It would even be in with a chance for the semi-finals if they could get Enrico Pallazzo to perform it.\u201d That may indeed be my favorite rendition of the anthem.  Colin Young needs musical advice: \u201cHi Beau, like many others I suspect, I\u2019m finding it hard to call this one. So instead I\u2019m taking requests. I was born stateside but have lived most of my life in the UK.. Even so, nothing brings out the Stars n Stripes in me more than a USMNT game. I\u2019m dj\u2019ing this evening in Brixton.. Should they prevail, what tune shall I play to celebrate? And what if they lose...? And no, it won\u2019t be \u2018Born In The USA\u2019. Any ideas out there? :)\u201d You\u2019ve come to the right place, Colin. I could talk music all day. It might clear the dance floor, but may I suggest a bit of Ray Charles either way?      2.22pm    First question for me from the inbox is \u2026 who are you? Well, not quite phrased like that. From Steve Wiles: \u201cI\u2019m not as up to date with the MBM as I used to be, so maybe you\u2019ve been around a while. Don\u2019t recognize the name though. Just wanted to say: \u2018This should be fun. Let\u2019s talk for a bit and then watch, shall we?\u2019 I like your style!\u201d Why, thanks, though I\u2019m sorry you weren\u2019t with me when I was up until all hours live-blogging the US Open this summer. I have an eclectic resume of MBM or lap-by-lap or game-by-game or skateboarding run-by-skateboarding run commentary. Fun story: When I was at USA Today in the 2000s, I did our online Olympic sports and soccer coverage, and I blatantly ripped off The Guardian\u2019s MBM style. And now they let me do it here. The other quick note: I am the co-coordinator of the Saturday Morning Breakfast Extravaganza at Potomac Curling Club. I have had to hand over the ice to our other volunteers today. Yes, I\u2019m missing curling to do this. (In the Canadian games, I did work in a lot of curling references.) This is a Very Big Deal. And please email my editors to get them to let me do end-by-end curling commentary sometime.      2.12pm    I wasn\u2019t kidding about Biden \u2026  In a more traditional setting, the Fox studio crew this morning includes their stalwart host Rob Stone, the \u201cnice guy in real life but provocateur on TV\u201d Alexi Lalas, the drawling Clint Dempsey, and an unusually animated Landon Donovan. Yes, unusually animated Landon Donovan, the guy who generally radiates California cool unless he has just scored an immense goal.  And now, Weston McKennie is in a movie trailer. That\u2019s a jarring transition.     2.07pm    One hour to go \u2026 Samuel L. Jackson just did the intro on Fox. I\u2019ve got chills, even though I would\u2019ve loved for him to say, \u201cWHAT DOES WESTON MCKENNIE LOOK LIKE?!\u201d Or Tarantino\u2019s tweaking of a verse from Ezekiel. And \u2026 whoa \u2026 Joe Biden?  This is starting to seem like a big deal.  Send in your emails while ye may, and I\u2019ll respond to as many as my typing speed and attention span will allow.     2.03pm   Netherlands lineup  The imposing Noppert is in goal, with van Dijk in the middle of the back line between Manchester City\u2019s Nathan Ake and young Ajax back Jurrien Timber. Daley Blind, who had a long spell with Manchester United but whose surname is synonymous with Ajax, is on the left, Denzel Dumfries, who moved last year from PSV to Inter, is on the right. Martin de Roon (Atalanta \u2013 the Italian club, not a misspelling of Atlanta United) and Davy Klassen (Ajax) will do their best to help de Jong control the midfield against the USA\u2019s outstanding MMA trio. (To be clear \u2013 \u201cMMA\u201d refers to their initials, not their style of play.) Gakpo and Memphis Dupay, a former Manchester United afterthought who scorched the nets for Lyon and has moved to Barcelona, play up front. Here\u2019s a nifty tactical look.      1.55pm   US lineup  And there\u2019s big news: Jesus Ferreira, the young goal-poacher who plays for FC Dallas (at the moment \u2013 he\u2019s destined to join Weston McKennie, Kellyn Acosta, Shaq Moore and other players in the USMNT talent pool as graduates of The Best Academy in the States who have gone to good clubs overseas), has been controversially omitted so far. Not today. He\u2019s starting in place of Josh Sargent, who was banged up against Iran. Walker Zimmerman returns to the back line despite Cameron Carter-Vickers doing quite well in that space against Iran. The rest is unchanged. Tim Ream, the Fulham veteran who had been out of the picture for quite a while but has served honorably alongside Zimmerman or CCV at center back, is still there, as is the MMA midfield of Adams, McKennie and Yunus Musah. The marauding outside backs of Antonee Robinson and Dest keep their spots as expected. Tim Weah, scorer of the goal against Wales and the man who had a goal called back against Iran in a razor-thin offside decision, remains on the front line. And yes, Christian Pulisic starts.   Updated at 2.39pm GMT    1.46pm    The many ties between these footballing nations \u2026 As mentioned, Dest grew up in the Netherlands and was part of the Ajax youth machine.  Also growing up in the Netherlands: Earnie Stewart, the US Soccer sporting director who scored some of the most important goals in US history, including the winner against Colombia in 1994. Also spending part of his career in the Netherlands: Gregg Berhalter, the US Soccer coach who went to some little state college* before moving to the Netherlands.  All this, plus an injury update on Christian Pulisic, in our preview by our US guy in Doha, Bryan Armen Graham:   (* \u2013 the University of North Carolina is a fine institution. I attended their greatest rival.)     1.39pm    In the Netherlands\u2019 favor \u2026 Well, they\u2019re the Netherlands, right? But are they a classic Dutch team? As \u201cthe guy who knows soccer\u201d in many a social setting, I\u2019m often asked to give ad hoc scouting reports of US opponents. \u201cOh, the Netherlands are great,\u201d I said. \u201cThey have great players like \u2026\u201d Um \u2026 OK, OK \u2013 Virgil van Dijk, yes. He\u2019s the bedrock of many a recent Liverpool success. Barcelona\u2019s Frenkie de Jong is great, even if Barcelona isn\u2019t really Barcelona these days. (Sergi\u00f1o Dest, incidentally, is a Barcelona player on loan to AC Milan, and he grew up in the Netherlands at Ajax, which rivals Barcelona in the race to be The Most Lauded Youth Academy on Earth.) Their goalkeeper, Andries Noppert, is \u2026 tall.  And Cody Gakpo is still relatively unknown because PSV Eindhoven isn\u2019t a glamour team these days, but that\u2019s going to change when a big club or three. comes calling after this Cup. With that, I\u2019ve ripped off most of Tom Dart\u2019s scouting report, but please do read the rest:  Oh \u2013 and they\u2019re not dull, insists Louis van Gaal.    Updated at 1.40pm GMT    1.29pm    In the USA\u2019s favor \u2026 Eric Wynalda, whose long history with the US team includes a goal in the 1994 World Cup, says this US team has a great goalkeeper in Matt Turner, a much-scrutinized player delivering the goods in Christian Pulisic, a solid defense, and a captain who inspires on and off the field in Tyler Adams.  And please do read more about Tyler Adams. His midfield tenacity is crucial, giving the US outside backs the freedom to attack, something that paid off against Iran when Sergi\u00f1o Dest put in the cross for Pulisic. And his composure in a press conference when asked a delicate question on race relations should be the envy of any world leader.   Updated at 1.40pm GMT    1.08pm   Preamble  Welcome to The Biggest US Men\u2019s Game Since the Last One \u2026 It\u2019s typical of a World Cup, of course, for each game to be \u201cbigger\u201d than the last, and we knew that about the US when we saw the draw.  Wales? OK, fine, typical group-stage game.  England? Now we\u2019re talking. The Land Where the Game Began has a losing record against the US in the World Cup. (And still does.) Iran? Uh oh. Flashbacks to 1998 and The Biggest Humiliation the US Ever Had in a World Cup. And a game that would surely determine whether they would advance. So this game, against \u2026 (checks notes) \u2026 the Netherlands is \u201cbigger\u201d in the sense that it\u2019s a round of 16 game. But it feels different, doesn\u2019t it? The concern that the US would embarrass itself has disappeared. Now, they\u2019re playing with house money. Is that the right term? I don\u2019t know gambling.  So it\u2019s a different type of nerves. Being the underdog is fun.  And this is winnable, isn\u2019t it? The oddsmakers generally give the Netherlands a 50% chance of winning outright, and then \u201cdraw\u201d and \u201cUS win\u201d split the other 50%. This being a knockout-stage game, \u201cdraw\u201d means \u201cpenalties,\u201d and which team will be feeling the pressure then? This should be fun. Let\u2019s talk for a bit and then watch, shall we?     1.00pm    Beau will be here shortly, but in the meantime here\u2019s how the two teams\u2019 campaigns have gone so far. How USA got here  In the opener, the US came storming out the gates and looked like they would carve up Wales for a convincing victory after Tim Weah\u2019s goal. But the Americans faded badly in the second period and the game ended in a 1-1 draw. USA then faced England, and maintained their unbeaten record against the Three Lions at the World Cup. The Americans were the better team but could not convert their chances in a 0-0 draw. The US needed to beat Iran in their final group game, and did so thanks to Christian Pulisic\u2019s effort, in which he definitely did not injure his unmentionables. The 1-0 victory sent the Americans through as Group B runners-up  How Netherlands got here  The Dutch left it late in their opening game, with their first goal coming in the 84th minute of their 2-0 victory. They also relied on a good performance from their keeper, Andries Noppert.  Cody Gakpo scored an early goal but the Dutch were put under pressure for large parts of the game in their 1-1 draw with Ecuador.  Gakpo was dangerous again as Netherlands coasted to a 2-0 win over the already eliminated hosts in their victory against Qatar. The win meant they progressed as group winners, even as manager Louis van Gaal bristled at suggestions watching his team is like \u201cgrinding teeth\u201d.    "

                    "body": "A Western Australian jockey has been given a six-week suspension for his role in a collision that cost the life of racehorse Chili is Hot at the Perth Cup on Sunday. The incident renewed calls from some animal welfare advocates to end horse racing in Australia.  Chili Is Hot, a five-year-old mare, was euthanised on the track at Ascot racecourse after a collision with another horse roughly 200 metres into the race in front of about 10,000 spectators. The other horse involved, Dom To Shoot, suffered abrasions and was left slightly lame after the incident. Initial reports suggest Chili is Hot clipped the heels of the horse in front of her, Buster Bash, and went down in the crowded pack, with Dom To Shoot unable to stop in time and running over the top of her. Jockey Joseph Azzopardi was riding Buster Bash. The incident was subject to a stewards\u2019 inquiry by Racing and Wagering WA on Monday, which examined footage of the fall and interviewed six jockeys who participated in the race. Azzopardi pleaded guilty to carless riding for allowing his mount to shift outwards when not sufficiently clear of Chili is Hot.  Jockey Peter Knuckey, who was riding Chili is Hot, and Jordan Turner, aboard Dom To Shoot, were cleared of serious injury. The incident led to the Perth Cup being called off for the first time in its 136-year history. The race will be rerun on 14 January. Race caller Darren McCauley said the crowd fell silent after the accident. \u201cThe crowd went from a mighty roar to utter disbelief,\u201d he told Channel Seven. James Oldring, the chief executive of Perth Racing, said it was \u201cone of the hardest events for anyone involved with racing to deal with\u201d. \u201cThe welfare of jockeys and horses is always our top priority,\u201d he said. \u201cOur thoughts are with all those connected with Chili Is Hot.\u201d An RSPCA WA spokesperson said \u201cthe fatality further highlights the need for changes to the thoroughbred racing industry\u201d. \u201cRacehorses are at risk of harm during races, training and trials with the main types of injuries involving muscle, bones, tendons and ligaments,\u201d they said. \u201cSerious injuries such as fractures and ruptured ligaments or tendons which cause pain or distress, and cannot be treated, should result in immediate euthanasia.\u201d Elio Celotto, campaign director at the Coalition for the Protection of Racehorses, said he was saddened but not surprised by the fatality. A report prepared by the activist group, using data collected by state and territory racing bodies, found that 139 horses either died or suffered a life-ending injury on Australian racetracks between 1 August 2021 and 31 July 2022. Celotto, whose organisation created the \u201cnup to the cup\u201d campaign in opposition to the Melbourne Cup, said public sentiment about horse racing was changing.  \u201cSince the high-profile deaths of horses in the Melbourne Cup, we have seen the majority of people actually feeling its not something they want to support,\u201d Celotto said. \u201cWhat happened yesterday is a perfect example with these horses put in such dangerous situations that inevitably some of them will be injured and some of them will be killed.\u201d Lonergan Research polling, commissioned by the Greens earlier this year, found 54% of people surveyed thought horses should not be raced for gambling and entertainment. Even more (59%) thought it was cruel."

                    "body": "It will irk Steve Clarke that Scotland were seconds from securing a seventh straight victory. Kieran Tierney\u2019s second-half header looked like continuing momentum for Clarke before the kind of moment which would have triggered huge controversy were this a competitive game. Clarke must take solace from the flowing nature of Scotland\u2019s play. Craig Gordon was judged to have upended the Poland substitute Krzysztof Piatek, with the goalkeeper unable to block the same player\u2019s penalty. Replays suggested there was no contact between Gordon and his opponent. Poland thereby snatched a draw they barely deserved, with the frustrations of those in navy blue endorsing their now lofty standards. The spot kick was Poland\u2019s second shot on target.  \u201cIt\u2019s a penalty decision for a friendly game and that\u2019s the best way to leave it,\u201d said a diplomatic Clarke. \u201cObviously we wanted to continue the winning run. It\u2019s a disappointment but it isn\u2019t the end of the world.\u201d That the match programme\u2019s front cover was simply an image of the Ukrainian flag pointed towards abnormal circumstances. Hampden Park was supposed to stage a World Cup playoff semi-final between the Scots and Ukraine on this very evening. Poland were due to take on Russia. Events thousands of miles from Glasgow altered that landscape entirely. To their credit, Scotland and Poland came together when insisting on a charitable element to this friendly. Unicef\u2019s efforts in Ukraine are to be directly assisted by funds raised from the fixture. Sometimes, football really can be a force for good. Poland\u2019s situation was different from that of their hosts in that they will play to reach the World Cup on Tuesday evening. It was no surprise, then, to see Robert Lewandowski named among the substitutes here. There remains a hope \u2013 if perhaps a forlorn one \u2013 that Scotland can face Ukraine in June. If it isn\u2019t crass to point as much out, given the human tragedy which continues to unfold in Ukraine, Scotland\u2019s prospects in respect of Qatar and the finals remains wholly unclear. Clarke and his employers have been consistent that they will be guided entirely by Fifa, Uefa and the Ukranian FA. Polish concern surrounded the enforced removal of Arkadiusz Milik, who limped off inside the opening half hour. Both teams had created chances until that point, in a match that was far from cagey. The atmosphere created by 39,000 helped in that respect. Poland were roared on by a sizeable and vociferous support while Scotland fixtures, for so long grim and unpopular affairs, have become trendy again on Clarke\u2019s watch. Che Adams stung the palms of Lukasz Skorupski from 22 yards as Scotland chased a breakthrough before the interval. Billy Gilmour forced the Poland goalkeeper into an even better save. As Bartosz Salamon was removed from proceedings because of injury before the break, the new Poland head coach, Czeslaw Michniewicz, had cause to question the football validity of this encounter. Earlier, Salamon had fired a free header wastefully over Gordon\u2019s crossbar.  Piatek, Milik\u2019s replacement, should have sent Poland ahead within three minutes of the restart. Jakub Moder had split the Scotland defence with a terrific pass but Piatek, with time and space on his side, screwed a shot well wide of Gordon\u2019s goal. Scotland, minus their captain Andy Robertson, were playing the more attractive football. Callum McGregor and Gilmour provided midfield fluidity. Nathan Patterson, with just 45 minutes against Boreham Wood to his name since swapping Rangers for Everton in January, surely afforded Frank Lampard food for thought given his prominence in Scotland colours.  John McGinn will contemplate whether he should have tumbled after rounding Skorupski from Gilmour\u2019s through pass. Replays were inconclusive as to whether the Aston Villa midfielder was clipped by the diving goalkeeper but McGinn\u2019s over-running of the ball halted what had been a promising Scottish position. To fall or not to dive became a post-match theme. Piatek\u2019s next opportunity was a glorious one. Poland broke sharply after Scott McTominay had stumbled over the ball on the halfway line. Piatek steadied himself and blasted a shot to beat Gordon, only for Gilmour to produce a terrific diving clearance. Gilmour has tenacity to match undoubted skill. McTominay, quite appropriately, was the first to hail his teammate. Clarke introduced Bologna\u2019s Aaron Hickey for a long-awaited full international debut. The teenager\u2019s first act was to join in a group celebration. McGinn whipped in a menacing free-kick from the right flank which Tierney stooped to head home, his first goal for Scotland on his 31st cap. Tierney\u2019s performances as a marauding left-sided centre-back have been a key constituent of Scotland\u2019s upward trajectory under Clarke.  Quite logically given earlier personnel issues, Poland left Lewandowski sitting on their bench. Piatek, belatedly, took on the scoring mantle as Scotland complained. \u201cWe were good tonight,\u201d added Clarke with typical understatement. He was correct."

Thanks for reading this MBM. Nighty night!\n\n\n\nUpdated at 9.22pm GMT\n\n\n 9.18pm  \n\nWe have people with cameras. They\u2019ve been out and about, and have found some perky Americans in a fan zone. Here they are \u2026\n\n\u2026 and the team themselves are pretty bullish too, Christian Pulisic telling Fox Sports: \u201cIt\u2019s all about winning the game, so we\u2019ve got to come out very aggressive ... to get to the next round. I\u2019m very confident we can do it.\u201d\n\nUpdated at 9.32pm GMT\n\n\n 9.14pm  \n\nGareth Southgate speaks to the station formerly known as Tyne Tees. \u201cIt was exactly the sort of game I thought it would be. A good opponent who were very athletic. I knew it would be difficult after such a high to replicate that type of performance, so I\u2019m really pleased how the players applied themselves. Some of the quality in the final third could have been a little bit better, but we\u2019ve shown great resilience to defend against opponents who kept asking questions. We controlled the game well from the back, but were just not able to open up with that clear-cut chance. We didn\u2019t quite have the same zip, but that\u2019s going to happen. This is tournament football, we\u2019re not going to roll through a tournament, and sweep through everybody without having nights like that, when you\u2019ve got to show different qualities to get the result. It will be a totally different game against Wales. Silver medal today was a point. It puts us in a really strong position in terms of qualification. If we can win our last game, we win the group.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n 9.07pm  \n\nHarry Maguire also talks to the station formerly known as LWT. \u201cWe wasn\u2019t at our best, but it\u2019s a point and it puts us in a strong position in our group. We know they are a good team, they play at a big tempo and we had to work hard. They had a couple of chances, but if we were more clinical with ours we\u2019d have probably won the game. We\u2019ll take the positive parts but work on the parts we need to improve on. World Cup games are tough. They\u2019re all top teams at this World Cup. We wasn\u2019t ruthless enough in the final third, but we have good forwards and I\u2019m sure the next game we\u2019ll be all right. We dug in and got the clean sheet. We stay in control of the group. Of course we wanted to win tonight and see the job through, but we\u2019re looking forward to the game against Wales now.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n 9.01pm  \n\nHarry Kane speaks to ITV. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t our best performance for sure. We had some good spells, created some good positions, but we didn\u2019t quite have the final product today. A great clean sheet that puts us in a great position in the group. We weren\u2019t clinical. The complete contrast against Iran, we took our chances really well. Today we had two or three good opportunities but didn\u2019t put them away. But overall we were playing a tough team, and we move on. At times we dealt with their press well. They\u2019re a good side, and you have to respect them. A draw ain\u2019t the end of the world, and we look forward to the next one. We know we can play better. It\u2019s a draw at a World Cup. No game is easy. People thought after our first performance we would landslide every team, but that\u2019s not the case. It leaves us in a really good position.\u201d\n\n\n\n 8.58pm  \n\nQuite a few boos greeted that full-time whistle. Quite a few England fans still not happy with Gareth Southgate. Tonight\u2019s performance was as limp as Monday\u2019s showing against Iran was effervescent. The USMNT were the better side, creating more chances, creating better chances, and hitting the bar. A fair bit of the feelgood factor surrounding England will have dissipated tonight. But some good news for Southgate and his side: this result means England are as good as through to the knockouts. They\u2019ll only miss out if Wales whack them by four goals next Tuesday. All four teams in Group B can still qualify.\n\n\n\n\n 8.52pm  \nFULL TIME: England 0-0 USA\n\nPulisic takes the point, rolling the free kick down the flank towards the corner flag, Reyna waiting for the whistle. And then that whistle blows. England still haven\u2019t beaten the USA at a World Cup!\n\n\n\nUpdated at 8.59pm GMT\n\n\n 8.51pm  \n\n90 min +4: Maybe one last chance for the US to snatch it! Maguire skittles Reyna to the ground, and Pulisic will swing one in from the right flank. \n\n\n\n 8.51pm  \n\n90 min +3: Shaw curls a stunning free kick into the mixer. Kane wins a header six yards out, only to send it off the top of his noggin and wide left. Huge chance to snatch what would have been, quite frankly, an undeserved win.\n\n\n\n 8.49pm  \n\n90 min +2: Another Grealish run, another free kick, drawn this time from Musah. A free kick in a dangerous position out on the left. Shaw to loop into a crowded box.\n\n\n\n 8.49pm  \n\n90 min +1: Maguire meets the corner, heading down. The ball softly bounces up into Turner\u2019s arms.\n\n\n\n 8.48pm  \n\n90 min: Henderson wins a free kick out on the right. It\u2019s taken quickly, Henderson\u2019s cross forcing Robinson to head out for a corner. It\u2019ll be taken during the first of four added minutes.\n\n\nUpdated at 8.50pm GMT\n\n\n 8.47pm  \n\n88 min: Pulisic, on the edge of the England box, finds Moore in the area to the right. A first-time ball through the six-yard box would have England in all sorts of trouble, but Moore hesitates, then cuts back to nobody in particular. England breathe again.\n\n\n\n 8.44pm  \n\n87 min: A little bit of space for Rashford, just to the left of the US D. He looks to curl one into the top right. No whip, no pace, and it\u2019s an easy claim for Turner.\n\n\n\n 8.44pm  \n\n86 min: England faff about in their own half for a while. The US let them get on with it. The clock ticks on.\n\n\n\n 8.42pm  \n\n85 min: The ball falls in the general environs of Maguire \u2026 but Ream reads the danger and gets in the way to blooter clear.\n\n\n\n 8.41pm  \n\n84 min: Grealish does what Grealish does, drawing a foul from the opposition out on the left wing. Everyone lines up on the edge of the American box. Shaw to take.\n\n\n\n 8.41pm  \n\n83 min: Gregg Berhalter, having listened to Tracy Moir, sends on Reyna. He replaces Weah, and is one of two changes, Wright making way for Sargent.\n\n\n\n 8.39pm  \n\n81 min: Henderson flings a garryowen into the US box. A bit early for this sort of desperation, but there it is. Turner claims under pressure from Kane. \u201cUSA fans are wondering why Reyna isn\u2019t on yet to bring some pace,\u201d writes Tracy Mohr. \u201cOur coach is not admired for his substitution nous.\u201d\n\n\n\n 8.37pm  \n\n79 min 49 sec: After coming on against Iran last Monday, Rashford had scored by now.\n\n\n\n 8.36pm  \n\n79 min: Rashford comes on for Saka.\n\n\n\n 8.36pm  \n\n78 min: Moore and Aaronson come on for McKennnie and a not particularly chuffed Dest. \u201cHere is Australia SBS TV have the World Cup and Martin Tyler as the commentator,\u201d begins Craig Fillingham. \u201cHe is on his own, so no one can help fill this game\u2019s void. In the first half, he actually spelt the Antonee of Antonee Robinson as he explained it was such a different way of spelling Anthony. Not criticising Tyler, but it is a reflection on the entertainment of the game.\u201d\n\n\n\n 8.33pm  \n\n76 min: England have certainly stemmed the flow of all those US attacks. They\u2019re not achieving much up the other end, but baby steps and all that. Meanwhile Jeremy Gostick writes: \u201cOn the basis of the Pickford/Bradford comment, I think you mean \u2018Notts County\u2019s Jack Grealish\u2019.\u201d My mistake. I humbly apologise.\n\n\n\n 8.31pm  \n\n74 min: Grealish is making his presence felt out on the left. A couple of dribbles down the flank. One nearly ends with him finding Kane in the box with a cutback, but the England captain is swarmed by blue shirts and the ball\u2019s cleared.\n\n\n\n 8.30pm  \n\n73 min: Dest is fine to continue. The game restarts.\n\n\n\n 8.30pm  \n\n72 min: Dest requires a spot of treatment after clattering into Shaw. \u201cIt\u2019s lucky that England have got the Iran game out of the way, because if you went by their respective performances today you\u2019d expect the latter to batter the former,\u201d notes K\u00e1ri Tulinius. \u201cFootball\u2019s a funny old sport.\u201d\n\n\n\n 8.28pm  \n\n70 min: Grealish dances in from the left, inviting a tackle that doesn\u2019t come. He eventually runs out of road just inside the box, but that got the English blood pumping for the first time in a while.\n\n\n\n 8.26pm  \n\n69 min: Kane and Saka try to unlock the US down the inside-right channel, but Musah slams the door shut and clears.\n\n\n\n 8.25pm  \n\n68 min: England make a double change. Sterling and Bellingham off, Grealish and Henderson on.\n\n\n\n 8.24pm  \n\n66 min: England are doing very little by way of response to this US pressure. \u201cA game of this magnitude, you\u2019d think England would have played Kane and Sterling.\u201d Paul Pooley, ladies and gentlemen, he\u2019s here all week. Try the machb\u016bs.\n\n\nUpdated at 8.27pm GMT\n\n\n 8.22pm  \n\n64 min: Wright wins yet another US corner down the left, off Stones. Pulisic takes, and curls long. For a second, it looks as though the ball\u2019s going to fly over his head and into the top right, but Pickford of Bradford fingertips out for a corner on the right this time. Zimmerman was tearing in, too, so that\u2019s a doubly crucial intervention. Nothing comes of the next corner.\n\n\n\n 8.20pm  \n\n63 min: The USA continue to dominate. Their fans are giving it plenty. On the touchline, Gareth Southgate has the good grace to look concerned.\n\n\n\n 8.19pm  \n\n61 min: Robinson strides down the left and wins another US corner. That one leads to another, and from that one, Pulisic is found in a bit of space just inside the England box on the left. He should take a shot, but over-elaborates, dropping a shoulder to beat Shaw, who refuses to give way. England finally clear their lines.\n\n\n\n 8.17pm  \n\n59 min: Pulisic cuts in from the left and is allowed to pass four men too easily. His shot is deflected wide left. Bradford City\u2019s Jordan Pickford gives his defenders the what-for. The resulting corner is headed clear by Maguire, under pressure from Zimmerman.\n\n\nUpdated at 8.18pm GMT\n\n\n 8.15pm  \n\n57 min: Weah cuts back from an advanced position on the right, nearly finding the in-rushing Musah. Bellingham reads the danger and intercepts just before the US midfielder can shoot. \u201cPlease note Guardian house style,\u201d begins Matt Tempest, formerly of this parish and therefore well schooled in finger-wagging. \u201cAt all times, England\u2019s keeper must be referred to as \u2018Bradford City\u2019s Jordan Pickford\u2019, on account of him playing a season at Valley Parade, on loan from Sunderland, in 2014-15. One game of which I saw. It\u2019s not often you see a future England star at Valley Parade.\u201d\n\n\n\n 8.13pm  \n\n55 min: Play restarts. Weah all good. Meanwhile here\u2019s some more pessimism from over the briny, courtesy of Peter Donley: \u201cI feel like the US team is being toyed with by the dominant English side. I\u2019ve seen more compassion with my family cat playing with a caught mouse.\u201d\n\n\n\n 8.11pm  \n\n54 min: Play stops for a moment as Weah gets some treatment, his foot having been accidentally stepped on by Shaw.\n\n\n\n 8.10pm  \n\n53 min: A chance for Mount to scamper into space down the middle. He miscontrols and allows the ball to sail through to Turner, who drops a shoulder to see off Sterling before passing clear.\n\n\n\n 8.09pm  \n\n51 min: Pulisic tears at pace down the left and has a chance of sending Musah free down the touchline, but his pass is no good. The USA have picked up where they left off. More of the same. England need to wake up quicksmart.\n\n\n\n 8.06pm  \n\n49 min: Space for Pulisic down the left. He lays off to Wright, whose shot is blocked by Stones. The ball breaks to McKennie, who blazes wildly over the bar. More composure and Pickford would have had some work to get on with.\n\n\n\n 8.05pm  \n\n48 min: A slow start to the second half. No obvious upsurge in England energy.\n\n\n\n 8.04pm  \n\n46 min: Meanwhile back home down Wembley Way, the FA have made their own One Love gesture.\n\n\n\n\n 8.02pm  \n\nThe USMNT get the second half underway. No changes made by either side during the break.\n\n\n\n 8.01pm  \n\nHalf-time Postbag O\u2019Pessimism. US supporter Liisa Sletzinger writes: \u201cProclamations that USMNT are dominating right now feel grossly overstated. We seem to be trying our hardest (and still can\u2019t shoot for crap) and England are yet to unleash.\u201d\nEngland fan John Davis adds: \u201cThe best thing about that half of football was finding out my local is doing two-pinters of Ghost Ship for \u00a34.40. This carries on and Wales can knock us out in Tuesday.\u201d\n\n\n\n 7.50pm  \nWho do you support?\n\nBefore you reach for the half-time oranges, please consider supporting Guardian journalism like this, for three reasons:\n\u2022 We are independent - no one tells us what we can and can\u2019t publish (and that includes Fifa)\u2022 We rely on readers funding us to keep us independent\u2022 We give you the full picture - the excitement on the pitch and the shame, corruption and injustice off it\nSupport the Guardian from as little as \u00a31 \u2013 it only takes a minute. Thank you.\n\n\n\n 7.48pm  \nHALF TIME: England 0-0 USA\n\nThe whistle goes after an extremely old-school period of added time: just one minute. The USA have been the better side. England head in to receive some tactical advice / a good classical rollocking.\n\n\nUpdated at 7.53pm GMT\n\n\n 7.46pm  \n\n45 min +1: Shaw rolls a pass in from the left for Sterling, who immediately flicks it down the channel for Mount. A first-time shot is fizzed towards the bottom left. Turner turns it around the post, then claims the resulting corner.\n\n\nUpdated at 7.51pm GMT\n\n\n 7.45pm  \n\n45 min: A bit of space down the right for Bellingham to sashay into. His long cross is hacked clear. Shaw picks up possession and comes down the left. He reaches the byline and cuts back for Saka, who improvises a flick that sails over the bar. Half a chance, that.\n\n\n\n 7.44pm  \n\n44 min: Shaw looks for Kane with a long diagonal from the left flank. Turner \u2013 confidence restored, those first-minute wobbles an awfully long time ago \u2013 comes out to claim without fuss.\n\n\n\n 7.43pm  \n\n43 min: Dest whips in from the right. Pulisic heads harmlessly wide left. Pickford shepherds the ball out for a goal kick. England could do with hearing the half-time whistle.\n\n\n\n 7.42pm  \n\n42 min: Dest tears clear on the overlap down the right. He drops a shoulder to cut into the box and looks for the top left. His shot deflects out off Maguire, who stuck to his task well. Maguire hoicks Pulisic\u2019s corner clear.\n\n\n\n 7.41pm  \n\n40 min: Space for Wright down the right. His cross is too long and high for Pulisic, who was in a bit of space in the middle. For what it\u2019s worth \u2013 and what it\u2019s worth is 0p (0\u00a2) \u2013 the USA are winning this on points.\n\n\n\n 7.40pm  \n\n39 min: McKennie throws long into the England box from the right. Wright spins and attempts to take on Maguire near the byline. He can\u2019t get past but Maguire is forced to poke out for a corner. Nothing comes of the set piece, but the USA have the upper hand now. \n\n\n\n 7.38pm  \n\n38 min: The US look determined to catch England cold on the turn. McKennie takes a super-quick throw down the right wing and nearly releases Weah. A simple gambit, but it nearly works. England are being asked a few questions here.\n\nUpdated at 7.39pm GMT\n\n\n 7.37pm  \n\n36 min: Shaw crosses in low from the left. Bellingham tries to flick cutely goalwards but can\u2019t connect. Turner eventually takes control and hoofs long towards Pulisic down the left, who is only just beaten to the ball by Stones, racing across from the middle. A crucial intervention by Stones. Without it, Pulisic was free and England were in all sorts of bother.\n\n\n\n 7.35pm  \n\n34 min: Maguire on the left wing again. This time he can\u2019t control, the ball clanking off his shin. Inner Garrincha all gone away!\n\n\n\n 7.34pm  \n\n33 min: McKennie makes good down the right. Musah shuttles the ball left to Pulisic, who drops a shoulder to make time and space before sending a rising shot towards the top-left corner. It beats Pickford but crashes off the bar and out for a goal kick. The USA are gaining in confidence all right!\n\n\n\nUpdated at 7.40pm GMT\n\n\n 7.32pm  \n\n31 min: McKennie accidentally catches Mount in the face. No malice, no yellow.\n\n\n\n 7.31pm  \n\n30 min: Musah is upended by Stones, and that\u2019s another England player who is slightly lucky not to see yellow. \u201cI really feel like watching England would be a lot, lot easier if we could convert Harry Maguire into a midfielder or centre-forward,\u201d begins James Dixon. No, hear him out. \u201cEvery time he has the ball in our half I can feel my chest tightening, yet whenever he\u2019s in possession in the opposition half, I feel the same kind of spontaneous and irrepressible joy I\u2019d get watching an adorable Newfoundland puppy playing in snow for the first time.\u201d\n\n\n\n 7.29pm  \n\n29 min: Pulisic drives down the left and feeds Robinson, who in turn finds Musah. He sashays back infield and nearly runs into the referee, who doesn\u2019t know which way to go. The ref finally sorts himself out and buggers off out of the road, allowing Musah to take a shot that\u2019s deflected but nevertheless flies straight at Pickford, who claims. The US are growing in confidence.\n\n\n\n 7.28pm  \n\n28 min: Trippier slides in late on Robinson, and is slightly fortunate not to go into the book. There didn\u2019t appear to be any malicious intent, to be fair. Merely mistimed.\n\n\n\n 7.27pm  \n\n26 min: Pulisic spins into space and drives down the middle. The ball\u2019s shifted right to Dest, who reaches the byline before cutting back for Weah, who curls towards McKennie, in a bit of space near the penalty spot. The ball drops perfectly, but McKennie leans back and blazes over. He should have hit the target at the very least. He probably should have scored. The grim look on his coupon suggests he very much believes the latter. What a chance!\n\n\nUpdated at 7.31pm GMT\n\n\n 7.24pm  \n\n24 min: Maguire creams a lovely diagonal pass down the left for Sterling, who drives into the US box and nearly gets the better of Dest. Not quite. The ball then pinballs around before being launched away from danger.\n\n\n\n 7.23pm  \n\n22 min: England slow it down again. All very professional.\n\n\n\n 7.21pm  \n\n20 min: The US roll a few passes to each other, then Dest makes good down the right. He swings the ball into the England box with plenty of pace. Pickford plucks it from the sky and dispenses some on-the-nose advice to his team-mates.\n\n\n\n 7.20pm  \n\n18 min: England make sure the US don\u2019t start working up a head of steam, passing the ball around the back to re-establish a semblance of authority. With entertainment at a premium, the fans engage in a back-and-forth England! U!S!A! battle. A fine atmosphere. Hugh Molloy was spot on.\n\n\n\n 7.17pm  \n\n16 min: Shaw and Sterling attempt to link up down the left. Both hesitate. Shaw eventually trundles a pea-roller into the arms of Turner. The US counter and launch their first attack. A cross comes in from the right, and Wright gets ahead of Stones to flash a header wide of goal. The first sign of an American threat.\n\n\n\n 7.14pm  \n\n14 min: Saka again makes a nuisance of himself down the right, reaching the byline before standing one up for Kane. Robinson heads clear just in time, before Kane can connect.\n\n\nUpdated at 7.22pm GMT\n\n\n 7.13pm  \n\n13 min: Such a shame Maguire couldn\u2019t go all the way and walk the ball into the net. They\u2019d have had to stop the entire tournament there and then. Football would have been completed. Game over. Where else would there be to go after that?\n\n\n\n 7.12pm  \n\n11 min: Some top entertainment as the corner\u2019s hit long. Near the corner flag, Maguire channels his inner Garrincha \u2013 Harry Maguire channels his inner Garrincha \u2013 and dribbles past two people before the ball ricochets back to Mount, who blazes over.\n\n\n\n 7.10pm  \n\n10 min: Bellingham\u2019s clearly fine, because he exchanges crisp passes with Saka down the inside-right channel. Saka cuts back for Kane, whose low shot is deflected wide right for the game\u2019s first corner.\n\n\n\nUpdated at 7.25pm GMT\n\n\n 7.09pm  \n\n9 min: Wright and Bellingham crash into each other as they contest a 50-50 ball. Both grimace, but both get back up.\n\n\n\n 7.08pm  \n\n8 min: England are enjoying more of the ball, but to little effect. The US are pressing them all the way.\n\n\n\n 7.06pm  \n\n6 min: Weah isn\u2019t too far away from closing down a hesitant Maguire, but the England man gets the ball out from under his feet and away in the nick of time. Yep, not too much to report yet.\n\n\n\n 7.04pm  \n\n4 min: Robinson tries to take on Trippier down the left, but loses the first battle of the evening. Throw to England. It\u2019s been a fairly quiet start, tell the truth.\n\n\n\n 7.03pm  \n\n3 min: Kane puts Turner under some more pressure. The US keeper appears a wee bit nervous during these early exchanges. He correctly executes his big hoof this time.\n\n\n\n 7.01pm  \n\n1 min: England pass it around the back in the patient style. Maguire and Stones giving each other a few touches. Then the ball\u2019s shuttled upfield, where US keeper Turner shanks a clearance into the stand. Ironic cheers. A fine atmosphere at the Al-Bayt Stadium by the sounds of it.\n\n\n\n 7.00pm  \n\nEngland get the ball rolling. They take the knee beforehand.\n\n\n\n 6.58pm  \n\nThe teams are out! England are dressed from tip to toe in white, changing their shorts because the normally similarly bedecked USA\u2019s second-choice colours are blue. They sing their anthems. Mason Mount gets the lyrics of God Save The Queen (King remix) correct this time. The Star Spangled Banner is a much better number \u2026 so belated Thanksgiving thanks to John Stafford Smith and Francis Scott Key for that. We\u2019ll be off in a couple of minutes.\n\n\nUpdated at 7.00pm GMT\n\n\n 6.52pm  \n\nGareth Southgate talks to ITV. \u201cYou\u2019re always wondering whether you should refresh things, but this team deserved to go again. If I was a player I\u2019d feel I\u2019d earned the right. We\u2019ve got great competition for places, but we were right to go with the same team. The USA put you under a lot of pressure and press well. It\u2019ll be a different game and we have to find solutions. We have to be positive. We overcame the first challenge really well but that is done. This is a different sort of challenge.\u201d\n\n\n\n 6.47pm  \n\nPre-match firework display. Doha sure looks pretty at night. Meanwhile in other it-all-goes-off news, here\u2019s Hugh Molloy: \u201cI\u2019m at the ground and the atmosphere is feral compared to England-Iran. Friday in Arabia is the first day of the weekend. All the expats have been at all-you-can-drink brunches (because Qatar is dry, right!) from noon and are on it. Going to be different.\u201d\n\n\nUpdated at 6.50pm GMT\n\n\n 6.02pm  \n\nEngland are in full If It Ain\u2019t Broke mode. Having beaten Iran 6-2, Gareth Southgate names the same starting XI. That means Harry Kane has passed a fitness test on that dodgy ankle, while Harry Maguire has got over the illness that truncated his contribution last Monday. \nGregg Berhalter makes just one change to the side that started the 1-1 draw with Wales. Haji Wright of Turkish S\u00fcper Lig club Antalyaspor replaces Josh Sargent of Norwich City. There are five Premier League players starting tonight for the US: captain Tyler Adams (Leeds United), Christian Pulisic (Chelsea), Tim Ream and Antonee Robinson (Fulham) and Matt Turner (Arsenal).\n\n\n\n 5.55pm  \nThe teams\n\nEngland: Pickford, Trippier, Stones, Maguire, Shaw, Bellingham, Rice, Saka, Mount, Sterling, Kane.Subs: Walker, Grealish, Henderson, Rashford, Pope, Phillips, Dier, Coady, Alexander-Arnold, Foden, White, Ramsdale, Wilson, Gallagher.\nUSA: Turner, Dest, Zimmerman, Ream, Robinson, McKennie, Adams, Musah, Weah, Wright, Pulisic.Subs: Reyna, Ferreira, Aaronson, Horvath, de la Torre, Long, Morris, Roldan, Moore, Carter-Vickers, Yedlin, Acosta, Sargent, Johnson, Scally.\nReferee: Jes\u00fas Valenzuela (Venezuela).\n\n\n\nUpdated at 6.17pm GMT\n\n\n 5.53pm  \n\nTonight\u2019s USMNT. One change from the Wales match, with Haji Wright replacing Josh Sargent.\n\n\n\n\n 5.47pm  \n\nThe England team. Harry Kane fit, then.\n\n\nUpdated at 5.50pm GMT\n\n\n 5.42pm  \n\nThis is how Group B looks in the wake of Wales 0-2 Iran. Late, late heartbreak for Wales fans, who nevertheless gave Iran a wonderful reception as they went on a lap of honour.\n\n\n\n\n\n 5.30pm  \nPreamble\n\nEngland first played the USA at the World Cup in 1950. As every schoolchild knows, it didn\u2019t go well for them.\n\nIt didn\u2019t go particularly well for them in 2010 either. Poor Rob.\n\nThird time lucky? A win tonight for Gareth Southgate\u2019s side will secure qualification for the knockout stage, and top spot in Group B. Hopes are high after that 6-2 rout of Iran. The USMNT\u2019s unremarkable 1-1 draw with Wales isn\u2019t quite so inspiring, but those two aforementioned World Cup meetings will give them succour, even if they\u2019ve not beaten the English since the days of Graham Taylor. Kick-off is at 7pm GMT, 2pm ET and 10pm at the Al-Bayt Stadium in Al Khor. \u0627\u0646\u0647 \u064a\u062d\u062f\u062b! It\u2019s on!\n\n"

                    "body": "Beth Mead says her third England hat-trick in six months shows her confidence has been restored. The goals came after she was dropped from the national team and the Team GB Olympic squad and Mead believes she has \u201cchannelled my disappointment in the correct way\u201d. After England\u2019s 10-0 defeat of North Macedonia in Skopje on Friday, she said: \u201cI never thought I would have scored a hat-trick in all these qualifiers. We can let these things break us or we can use them as motivation and I think it motivated me this season to do better on and off the pitch. I can control what I\u2019m doing and enjoy my football. Hopefully that\u2019s showing on the pitch. I\u2019m confident and that\u2019s really showing.\u201d  Mead said not flying to Tokyo was a blow but she is using the setback to help recover her best form in an England shirt. \u201cI\u2019m in between,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m over it, but I can also still try and use it in the right way to motivate me. \u201cThere were a lot of question over that decision, but I have to accept that, swallow it. Some people can let it affect them but I\u2019ve used it in the right way and I\u2019m getting the rewards of it.\u201d Part of that uplift has come because the new manager, Sarina Wiegman, has helped her this season. \u201cI\u2019ve come into this season and played with confidence, not overthought my game too much,\u201d said Mead. \u201cI know I have the capabilities to be a good player and do good things on the pitch. Last season I maybe got into my head a bit too much and Sarina has settled me, given me confidence, starts in some games, and I\u2019ve really relished playing under her.\u201d Mead has further benefited from Lauren Hemp\u2019s blistering work on the opposite flank, which was evident against North Macedonia. \u201cIt\u2019s super nice to play with Lauren and Ellen [White] up top,\u201d said Mead. \u201cLauren can beat any full-back in the world and sometimes you know if you get in the box she\u2019ll produce a good cross or a good effort and you get on the rebound. A couple of them happened today and that\u2019s why I got on the end of them \u2013 her positive play sometimes becomes my positive play.\u201d Her first goal started with a Hemp cross Mead slammed into the roof of the net at the far post after White struggled to connect. Her third came from another Hemp cross and her fourth was poked in after the goalkeeper, Viktorija Panchurov, parried a Hemp shot. Mead\u2019s second was a neat, dinked effort over Panchurov that slipped inside the far post just ahead of the waiting White.  The Arsenal forward walked into the press conference clutching a match ball. She was flanked by Ella Toone who held another match ball after her second hat-trick in the same period, having made her senior debut in February 2021. \u201cIt\u2019s so good to share this moment with Beth,\u201d said Toone, whose second goal came after Mead knocked the ball down to her unmarked in the middle.

Williamson was on the fringes at the 2019 Women\u2019s World Cup, with the six minutes the Arsenal defender played against Cameroon, having been brought on as a late substitute by Phil Neville, her only action of the tournament in France. Not only is Williamson set to be in the starting XI when the Euros get going at Old Trafford on 6 July but she will do so wearing the armband.  \u201cI followed her before I came in here as the manager, she\u2019s a very talented player,\u201d said Wiegman, England\u2019s head coach. \u201cNow, she has so many more high-level and high-intensity games in her legs and in her brain. That has really helped her. She\u2019s more mature, she can still grow \u2013 I\u2019m still growing, we\u2019re all still growing every day \u2013 but she\u2019s ready for the opportunity on and off the pitch.\u201d Wiegman denied there was a risk in making someone with so little major tournament experience the national team captain at a home Euros. She said: \u201cShe\u2019s herself and she won\u2019t be a different person when she wears the armband. I do think that we have shared responsibilities, so what we shouldn\u2019t do is put it all on the shoulders of Leah. As a team we all have responsibilities and, when it\u2019s needed, she steps up and talks or uses her way of leadership.\u201d England will be without Williamson for the game in Skopje as the 25-year-old has missed training and been under precautionary concussion protocols. The hope is she will be fit for Tuesday\u2019s game with Northern Ireland. \u201cShe is doing well,\u201d said Wiegman. \u201cShe came into camp good, but we didn\u2019t want to take any risks. She had a little bit of a headache, so we take the medical protocols. She just needs to take a little more time in her programme to build her up. Also, no heading [in training] so she\u2019s not ready for the game on Friday.\u201d  Sign up for our new and free women\u2019s football newsletter!  England will also be without Williamson\u2019s Arsenal centre-back partner Lotte Wubben-Moy and Manchester City defender Alex Greenwood for Friday\u2019s game. The pair have not travelled because of knee and thigh injuries respectively. Everton\u2019s Gabby George, who was in camp with the Under-23s, has been called in. Looking ahead to the Euros, Wiegman believes her squad is in a \u201cgood place\u201d, adding: \u201cYou always want more as a coach, more time, but the time schedule is so clear, you have this time, these camps, and that\u2019s what you have and you have to do your job. \u201cI was really happy with the games we had in February, they were really competitive, this is another opponent, we all know the reason why we play these matches [so close to the Euros], because Covid delayed things, so we just have to deal with the situation and be agile. We know on 6 July we have to be ready for the Euros.\u201d"

                    "body": "Middle Eastern states are to land a $1.3tn (\u00a31.09tn) windfall from extra oil revenues over the next four years, according to the International Monetary Fund. The IMF said on Friday it expected oil and gas exporters in the region, notably the Gulf states, to benefit from high prices and opportunities to ramp up their market share. The oil and gas sector is in flux after Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, which has upended markets and sent prices soaring. Russia has increased exports of oil to Asian nations, while Vladimir Putin\u2019s tactic of limiting gas supplies into Europe has left countries seeking new supply sources. Jihad Azour, the IMF\u2019s director for the Middle East and north Africa, told the Financial Times that countries in the Middle East could expect to receive $1.3tn more in cumulative revenues than was forecast before the invasion of Ukraine. He said Gulf states needed to use the windfall to \u201cinvest in the future\u201d, including efforts to switch towards greener energy sources. \u201cIt\u2019s an important moment for them to \u2026 accelerate in sectors like technology [domestically] as this is something that will allow them to increase productivity,\u201d Azour said. \u201cIn addition, their investment strategy could benefit from the fact that asset prices have improved for new investors, and the capacity to increase their market share in certain areas are also opportunities.\u201d The windfall is expected to benefit some of the world\u2019s biggest sovereign wealth funds, including the Qatar Investment Authority, Saudi Arabia\u2019s Public Investment Fund (PIF), the Kuwait Investment Authority and Abu Dhabi\u2019s Mubadala and ADQ. Gulf states are expected to spend the proceeds of the oil boom on building huge infrastructure projects, as well as investing overseas. Azour said: \u201cWhat is going to be really important is how they [Gulf states] manage this new cycle and how they maintain, at the same time, the benefits of the additional liquidity and the policies that will not lead them into pro-cyclicality.\u201d The IMF predicted the Gulf Cooperation Council \u2013 which includes the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Bahrain, Oman and Qatar \u2013 would collectively increase economic growth by 6.4% this year, from 2.7% growth last year. Last weekend, Saudi Arabia\u2019s largely state-owned energy firm, Saudi Aramco, underscored the colossal profits made by gas- and oil-rich countries during the energy crisis by revealing that profits in the three months to the end of June jumped 90% to $48bn. It is one of the largest quarterly profits in corporate history and represents a fillip for PIF, a backer of the company. PIF, chaired by the crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, invested more than $7.5bn in US stocks in the second quarter of the year, including Amazon and PayPal. The energy crisis shows little sign of easing, after the Russian state gas company, Gazprom, warned this week that European gas prices could soar by 60% to more than $4,000 per 1,000 cubic metres this winter. On Friday, Wolfgang Kubicki, the vice-president of the German parliament, said Germany should allow the blocked Nord Stream 2 (NS2) pipeline to begin pumping Russian natural gas so \u201cpeople do not have to freeze in winter and that our industry does not suffer serious damage\u201d. There are fears of blackouts in Germany this winter as the country faces the prospect of a potential recession. Ukraine\u2019s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, rebuked Kubicki, likening politicians\u2019 demands to temporarily switch the pipeline on to a \u201cdrug addiction\u201d. He said: \u201cCalls by some German politicians to launch NS2 for a little while and close it later are totally irrational. \u201cThis resembles drug addiction, when a person says: \u2018Just one last time!\u2019 without realising the devastating consequences of each \u2018last time\u2019. Addiction to Russian gas kills!\u201d The extent of the energy crisis in Britain is expected to be laid bare on 26 August when Ofgem sets the next industry price cap, which will be implemented in October. The cap is expected to rise from \u00a31,971 to \u00a33,582."

                    "body": "Rachael Haynes barely got a look in the last time a 50-over Women\u2019s World Cup was played, in 2017: she was selected for two of the matches \u2013 both times only because Meg Lanning was sitting out with a shoulder injury. One match into Australia\u2019s 2022 campaign and how the tables have turned. On Saturday, Haynes led the charge, hitting her maiden World Cup century as she took Australia to a 12-run victory in their opening encounter of the tournament against England. Lanning, meanwhile, joined her for a record-breaking second-wicket stand of 196 (the highest partnership against England in an ODI) but was generally content to play second fiddle, falling 14 runs short of a century of her own.  It was a day for breaking records. By the time Haynes was dismissed in the penultimate over, holing out to deep midwicket, she had 130 runs to her name \u2013 the highest individual score made against England in a World Cup. A mini-onslaught from Ellyse Perry (14 not out from five balls), who smashed three boundaries from Sophie Ecclestone\u2019s final over, took Australia to a total of 310 for three \u2013 the highest against England in a World Cup. Unassailable? Only just, as it transpired. At 232 for six in the 42nd over England looked down and out, but where Katherine Brunt is concerned, you should never count them out. Joining her fiancee, Nat Sciver, at the crease, the pair smashed 64 from 45 balls, taking England within touching distance of victory. Only a stunning one-handed grab from Jess Jonassen, tasked with defending 15 from the last over, could do for Brunt. Sciver, who had brought up a brilliant 79-ball hundred in the 48th over with a sneaky little paddle through fine leg, finished unbeaten on 109, as Australia\u2019s convincing win turned into a nail-biter. One match in for the defending champions and it is pretty clear that this World Cup is going to be a wild ride. \u201cIn tournament play it\u2019s good to have those tight contests and be pushed \u2013 England certainly did that,\u201d Haynes said. \u201cTo walk away with the win is a really positive start to our campaign.\u201d  Sciver, too, was keen to take the positives. \u201cIt feels frustrating [not to get the win] but also really encouraging,\u201d she said. \u201cFrom where we were at the end of the Ashes, to be able to turn that around in a couple of weeks is really important. We\u2019ve already seen some high-scoring games and it\u2019s important for us to do the same.\u201d England\u2019s run chase had started limply before Sciver\u2019s hundred showed the way to brighter things. The usual suspects did their thing: Lauren Winfield-Hill bagged a four-ball duck, while Amy Jones holed out to midwicket in single figures. In between times, Heather Knight (40) showed intent, striding down the pitch to slam Jonassen\u2019s first ball over long-off for six while Tammy Beaumont (74) became the fastest woman to reach 3,000 ODI runs. Fittingly, on a day when the cricket world was united in mourning for the untimely death of Shane Warne, it was the leg-spinner Alana King (three for 59) who further dented England\u2019s hopes, doing for Sophia Dunkley just when her sixth-wicket partnership with Sciver looked to be gaining momentum. After ripping the ball past Beaumont\u2019s outside edge and having her stumped, King tapped her black armband to acknowledge the debt. Having been put in to bat by Knight, Australia\u2019s innings had begun with necessary grafting from Lanning and Haynes. \u201cI found it really tricky early, it was slow coming through and England got a bit of swing early,\u201d Haynes said. \u201cThey were really disciplined with their lines, it was tough to get going.\u201d  It was not until both players had secured their half-centuries in the 31st over that they felt able to accelerate. That the innings ended with a bang, with Haynes and Beth Mooney (27 not out off 19) scoring 59 runs from the final five overs, turned out to be Australia\u2019s salvation."

                    "body": "Behold. For he is risen. Gareth Bale is feeling better. Pictures of Bale training happily in Cardiff this week confirmed there are no lingering effects from the back pain (or \u201cnot feeling right\u201d, according to Carlo Ancelotti) which had kept Bale out of Real Madrid\u2019s 4-0 shellacking at home against Barcelona on Sunday night. And as miracles of healing go, this is a timely one, after an absence which just happened, by pure coincidence, to fall four days before the biggest (and surely last) opportunity Bale is going to get to lead Wales to a World Cup. Let\u2019s face it, he was never going to miss this one.  Nobody could ever accuse Uefa of dumbing down or oversimplifying its qualifying pathway. But at the end of that labyrinthine process Wales have been presented with what is, on the face of it, a highly favourable route to Qatar. Robert Page\u2019s team are well capable of winning Thursday\u2019s home semi-final against Austria, who got here by finishing as the sixth\u2011highest ranked Nations League group winner, came fourth in qualification Group F, and are ranked 10 places lower than Wales by Fifa. The same goes for a final home eliminator against Scotland or Ukraine whenever world events permit \u2013 Uefa\u2019s June scheduling already looks optimistic. If this still feels like a complex chain of events with the World Cup itself only eight months away, there is at least a streamlined quality to the chat around the latest chapter in Welsh football\u2019s grail quest of the past 64 years. We will, of course, be talking about Bale and Aaron Ramsey. Let\u2019s do this one more time. Because it is always a little later than you think.  There are good reasons for focusing on those star names. Bale and Ramsey remain hugely potent figures. Together they have 56 international goals; no one else in the current squad has got past five. This has been such a clearly defined era, during which these two outstanding talents have been the armature of the Welsh national team, where in other environments star players might end up as decoration. There is a sense here of something being played out to its final course. Much has been made of the likely atmosphere at the Cardiff City Stadium with some hopeful talk that the shared energy of a 30,000 crowd might be enough to disorientate opponents who have also missed out on the past five World Cups. There are two issues with this. First, Austria have their own big-game players. Never mind David Alaba or Marcel Sabitzer, Marko Arnautovic remains a brilliantly talented footballer whose greatest weakness seems to be his capacity to fall asleep for long periods of his own career. Prodding him with a stick might not actually be the most productive tactic. Mainly, though, successive qualifying campaigns in the Bale\u2011Ramsey era have been curtailed by very similar occasions, home defeat by a beatable opponent \u2013 with the caveat that on none of the three previous occasions have Wales managed to get both men out on the field at the same time with the scores still level. In October 2017 Wales lost 1-0 against the Republic of Ireland, also at the Cardiff City Stadium, to kill off lingering hopes of a trip to the modern, open, globalist Russia of Vladimir Putin. Wales had Ramsey but not Bale on a night when the Euro semi-finalists continued to struggle with the idea of not being underdogs. Four years earlier it was a defeat at the Liberty Stadium by Croatia that killed any dreams of Brazil 2014, as Wales fielded Bale but no Ramsey, who was suspended. Four years before that, a 2-0 defeat by Finland at the Millennium Stadium did at least see both men on field at the same time, with Ramsey a second-half sub, although Bale was still shackled to a defensive left\u2011back role.  Would it help to add that four years before that, hopes were also stilled by a home defeat \u2013 this one against their opponents on Thursday, Austria? Probably not. Although a year later Bale became the youngest capped Welsh footballer, Ramsey joining him in the squad a year after. And from there it has overall been a genuinely uplifting mini\u2011era, a feat of team building so organic that both men have been able to step back into this side whatever their state of fitness or the dramas of their club careers. This process will now be tested to the full. Ramsey has three starts and one goal in club football since August. Bale has played two hours for Madrid in the past six months, and seems to have reached what is, on his \u201cbook age\u201d, a premature state of declining appetite.  It is easy to forget two things at this late stage. First, both men started so young. Bale made his professional debut three months before the 2006 World Cup, a footballing era so distant that two members of England\u2019s own golden squad in Germany have been heard in the past week reminiscing about just how fine, and how much more difficult, life was back then. The 32-year-old Bale has played through the passage from then to now, and has sustained 21 injuries in the past four years alone. For all the sense of an extended Ferris Bueller\u2019s Day Off in the late stage of his Madrid career, it is easy to overlook just how good Imperial Bale was: as exhilarating as anything the Premier League has seen, up there in a divine trinity with Peak Henry and Peak Ronaldo.  Sign up to our new women\u2019s football newsletter  It has been a debilitating style too, based on explosive speed and running power, on inviting collisions. In spite of which Bale has played more than 600 professional games and scored more than 100 goals for Madrid alone. He has driven a relatively small football nation to a major semi\u2011final. Even in relative decline, he reeled off that flying top corner overhead in Kyiv, the greatest goal scored in a Champions League final. It has been one of the great careers. Not that anyone in Wales needs reminding. But there is also a cost now to configuring a team around these basking giants. The tactical blanket is always too small, all the more so with two creative players in reduced states of mobility. Wales have tried different systems under Page, and have looked solid and hungry in their past four games. Ramsey started in all four. Bale played just 45 minutes. Welsh football has always been an enigmatic thing. The extended World Cup absence makes little sense given the quality of footballers produced, although often this has translated into an overload of creative attacking players. At a time when the FAW Trust is launching an extended grassroots drive, menaced by a lack of facilities or a clear pathway, alarmed at seeing outstanding young talents hoovered up by clubs across the border, a place at the winter World Cup would be a significant parting gift for the current golden mini-era."

                    "body": "  11.26pm   Jonny speaks!       11.26pm   Read Ali Martin's report of day one       9.51pm    I think Joe Root will be the happier of the two-captains after that inspired recovery from a soggy dot-to-dot start. West Indies bowled well in fits and starts before that superb Jonny Bairstow innings, from battler to aggressor in stages one, two and three, accompanied by Stokes, Foakes, and Woakes. Here he is post-match, looking gloriously happy:  \u201cIt feels amazing to be honest, I\u2019ve been fortunate enough to be on a few tours here and it feels amazing, its great fun playing over here. We\u2019ve spoken about partnerships and how crucial it can be and if we can continue that tomorrow it is really important. I think theres\u2019s still plenty in it, that far end is going to be interesting by the end. It\u2019s had a full day of sunshine and wind on it. We\u2019re going to try and get as many as possible in this first innings and when we do bowl its about being patience, I think its going to be about being attritional.\u201d That\u2019s it from me, thanks for all the messages and sorry I didn\u2019t get to them all. We\u2019re back tomorrow - see you then! Good night.     9.35pm   Close of play: England 268-6 (Bairstow 109, Woakes 24)  86th over: England 268-6 (Bairstow 109, Woakes 24) With a dash into the legside, the fifty partnership comes up in 96 balls and there\u2019s a stat on Sky about Bairstow and England and fifty partnerships which I don\u2019t quite catch but I think is impressive. Oh and that\u2019s gorgeous from Woakes, he dips the knee and sends the ball flying through extra cover for four. Seales rubs his hands and shakes his head in disappointment. Here\u2019s the last ball of the day: defended with aplomb, straight back down the pitch by Woakes. He and Bairstow hug, Brathwaite doles out a hug too, and Holder, in fact nearly all the West Indies team line up to bump fists. Bairstow grins the broadest of grins, and as he walks off is greeted by a smiling Joe Root.  Updated at 9.39pm GMT    9.29pm    85th over: England 263-6 (Bairstow 108, Woakes 20) Holder beats Woakes; Woakes flicks him past the diving man at midwicket for two. An over to go.      9.25pm    84th over: England 261-6 (Bairstow 108, Woakes 18) Woakes orders the ball to the cover boundary, and the ball obliges.  \u201cGood evening Tanya! \u201cHello Kim Thonger.\u201cAbsorbing stuff. Good old fashioned gutsy innings from Bairstow. Reminds me of Colin Milburn for some reason. I\u2019d have liked to see them bat together. But watching Stokes with Sobers or Root with Richards would have been wonderful too. Surely the quantum wizards and witches who run the simulation in which we \u2018live\u2019 could make it happen?\u201d     9.21pm    83rd over: England 253-6 (Bairstow 107, Woakes 13)This is dragging on because of the slow over rate by the way, I think close of play is at 9.30 GMT, whatever number the overs have ticked on to. A leg-bye and a single off Roach.     9.19pm    82nd over: England 253-6 (Bairstow 106, Woakes 13) Seales unleashes an absolute beauty which beats Bairstow, but he picks ups a couple next ball with a stand and swing. In the stands Andrew Strauss is staring intensely at his phone as the early strains of Neil Diamond are pumped around the ground..     9.13pm    81st over: England 251-6 (Bairstow 104, Woakes 13) A single trumpet echoes over the stadium and clouds start to gather over the pavilion. Fluffy ones. Kemar Roach has the new ball and the first delivery boomerangs in, but Bairstow is equal to it. Woakes picks up three through midwicket.      9.08pm    80th over: England 245-6 (Bairstow 101, Woakes 10) Nothing much to say about those six balls, it all about what happens next. An email arrives from Andrew Benton:\u201cDid the Guardian do anything special to celebrate women\u2019s day today for its contributors? I see you didn\u2019t get the day off ! But cricket on telly has been pretty good at mixing up the commentaries it seems - men and women commenting on men and women\u2019s. It\u2019s so much nicer to watch, much better balanced. \u201c I agree, TV has shown the way, and it felt so natural so quickly.      9.03pm    79th over: England 245-6 (Bairstow 101, Woakes 10) Some pleasingly binary scores there. One over to the second new ball.      9.01pm   Hundred for Jonny Bairstow!  78th over: England 241-6 (Bairstow 101, Woakes 6) A leap, a double-clenched salute, a ginger roar! Bairstow goes to his hundred with a sweeping dismissal of Brathwaite\u2019s lobbing temptation. A smashing innings that recast the innings. Fisher brings the end of over drinks and victory banana out to his Yorkshire teammate - a nice touch.   Updated at 9.04pm GMT    8.53pm    77th over: England 235-6 (Bairstow 96, Woakes 5) The new ball is available in three overs. Will Jonny want those three figures safely in his pocket by then? Woakes plays out a Joseph over to the sleepy sounds of a day drawing to a close. Thank you so much Gareth Wilson for finding the article that I couldn\u2019t quite place: the not-so-nervous nineties.      8.50pm    76th over: England 235-6 (Bairstow 96, Woakes 5) Just a single off the remarkable, miserly, Holder.  \u201cHello Tanya,\u201d Good evening Geoff Wignall! \u201cThat was an interesting email from Robert Wilson but he\u2019s a bit harsh on Collingwood when there are so many other \u2018misfires and misfits\u2019 from whom to choose who didn\u2019t manage a 40 plus average and weren\u2019t worth at least an extra 10 for their fielding. PS the email link for you at the top of the OBO doesn\u2019t seem to work. It came up as merely freelance@\u201d Ahh....while I try to fix it, and in case anyone wants to get in touch, it is tanya.aldred.freelance@theguardian.com     8.47pm    75th over: England 233-6 (Bairstow 95, Woakes 4) Events! First Woakes nearly runs out Bairstow as Joseph (drops/brushes his fingers on the ball in his follow through) and the ball slams into the stumps (quick-stepping Bairstow is back in his crease) then he is dropped at second slip by Holder, then he squeaks one through the cordon for four. Woakes shakes his head and refuses to catch YJB\u2019s eye.     8.41pm    74th over: England 229-6 (Bairstow 95, Woakes 0) The cricketer to keep a cool head in a crisis bowls to the cricketer who bend spoons with his intensity. Ying smothers yang and it\u2019s a maiden. \u201cHello Tanya.\u201d Hello Tim Sanders! \u201cLovely stuff about Jonny from Robert Wilson. I beg only to differ on his judgement of Paul Collingwood who was a splendid, fighting Test cricketer who would block for ever, or unfurl his strokeplay, or a bit of both, as the game demanded.\u201d     8.37pm    73rdover: England 229-6 (Bairstow 95, Woakes 0) Joseph has the task of trying to curtail Bairstow, and he mostly does. No boundaries, but two fiercely run twos.      8.34pm    72nd over: England 224-6 (Bairstow 90, Woakes 0) Holder enquires politely after an lbw, but it\u2019s a no from the ump. A single eases Bairstow into the decade of doom (actually I think I once read something that said you weren\u2019t overly likely to get out in the nervous nineties).     8.29pm    71st over: England 222-6 (Bairstow 88, Woakes 0) Baristow greets Joseph with the air of a man who wants his dinner and wants it now. Short arm jab BOUNDARY, ANOTHER through backward point. Apparently, his last seven scoring shots have been boundaries, but he spits in the face of such stats and sprints two.  Exactly so.     8.24pm    70th over: England 214-6 (Bairstow 80, Woakes 0) So West Indies Mr unflappable makes the breakthrough, just as he did at the tail end of that already-slightly-hazy white-ball series.  This, by Robert Wilson, captures the essence of Bairstow: \u201cHey there. Hope the dawg is well. Also hoping Bairstow gets a ton. In a double decade of Test msifits and misfires (however amiable) like Eoin Morgan, Collingwood and the Buttler didn\u2019t do it, Bairstow has been Mark Waugh. He can properly bat. And has often proved it. His Test average should be a lot closer to his 1st-class one (mid-forties from memory). It\u2019s a mental game and he has some bad habits but he has been multiply humped in selection terms and that has got between his ears for years. \u201cIt makes me think of Talent\u2019s scatterbrained promiscuity, (and its innate sense of mischevious injustice). The God of Talent ladles out the gifts to two basic character types. Obviously to the Warnes, the riotously irresponsible, bibulous and randy wideboys who party for a couple of decades while nonchalantly breaking records set by the industrious and sincere. But also to the chartered accountants of sporting genius like Bradman. Where even the most egregious flair and aptitude are ground fine in the relentless war machine of one dedicated and charmless superego. \u201cMessi is an outlier. A definite accountant but imbued with so much laughably extreme grace and inspiration that he seems like some kind of angelic pickpocket or pirate.Poor old Bairstow is an outlier too. Because he\u2019s a mere human being. With a lot of skill and nous. We\u2019ve all helped grind it out of him.\u201d     8.19pm   WICKET! Foakes lbw Holder 42 (England 214-6)  And with the partnership tantalisingly teetering on 99, Foakes plays across the line to Holder\u2019s second ball. He reviews, hopefully, but no cigar. A reassuring and elegant innings for Foakes on his comeback. They take DRINKS with a tasty 50 minutes or so left in the day.    Updated at 8.25pm GMT    8.15pm    69th over: England 214-5 (Bairstow 80, Foakes 42) Two slog-sweeps and two more boundaries to YJB, who has the fire now.     8.12pm    68th over: England 205-5 (Bairstow 72, Foakes 41) Bairstow muscles a wide one over midwicket for four, and very next ball is a jaffa, a beauty, steaming off the pitch, kissing the inside edge, somehow missing the stumps before steaming to the rope..To add insult to injury for Roach, it is a no ball. A Jonny riposte follows, a short, sharp jab for four more.     8.07pm    67th over: England 192-5 (Bairstow 60, Foakes 41) Theses two seem to be taking it in turns to score. Foakes has the nod at the moment, with a couple through the covers then a tippy-toed one-two down the pitch and flick: into the on side and over the boundary.     8.03pm    66th over: England 185-5 (Bairstow 60, Foakes 35) Time for Roach to do some donkey work on this sleepy old pitch. Just a no-ball to add to the score.   So true.     7.59pm    65th over: England 185-5 (Bairstow 60, Foakes 35) Permaul shimmies through another, and just one to Bairstow.      7.56pm    64th over: England 184-5 (Bairstow 59, Foakes 35) West Indies look like getting the ball changed at last as the box of crimson goodies comes out, but it seems they\u2019ve ended up with the original. Seales, white sweat band on one wrist, watch on the other, glides his long legs to the crease. Foakes nurdles an over-pitched to the rope, next ball sends another down to long on. No sourness curdling his milk.     7.47pm   REVIEW- NOT OUT!  63rd over: England 176-5 (Bairstow 59, Foakes 27) Bairstow gets down on one knee to play an ugly old swipe and is appalled to be given out caught behind. The review shows air between bat and ball and Permaul loses a wicket from his analysis.      7.44pm    62nd over: England 176-5 (Bairstow 59, Foakes 27) Seales is full of beans, varying his length efffectively.     7.40pm    61st over: England 175-5 (Bairstow 58, Foakes 27) Permaul wheals through another, as a selection of light snacks arrive in the living room. Two to Foakes from a dab.     7.37pm    60th over: England 173-5 (Bairstow 58, Foakes 25) Jayden Seales returns, and Bairstow picks up a couple off his boot-caps. Lionel Richie balladeers over the sound system - I\u2019m guessing more for the benefit of the barmy army than any home supporters.     7.34pm    59th over: England 171-5 (Bairstow 56, Foakes 25) Four more, this time to Foakes, who had become becalmed on 21: a rather charming flurry to midwicket.  \u201cGood evening, Tanya.\u201d Bon soir Charles Lomas in Aulas. \u201cAs an aging pedestrian of somewhat limited mobility, I wish you would not use the word \u201cpedestrian\u201d in a pejorative sense. I walk slowly but I am not a long hop. You don\u2019t want to sound like David Gower.\u201d I consider myself chastised, though \u201cI walk slowly but am not a long hop\u201d is a fantastic first line for a riddle.     7.29pm    58th over: England 167-5 (Bairstow 56, Foakes 21) The game suddenly sparks into life, as YJB sizzles Joseph through backward point with a sizzle of insouciance. Two balls later he chops down a bit late and the inside edge flies, in spitting distance of his stumps. Two more come thanks to genuine sprinting back to the striker\u2019s end.     7.24pm   Fifty for Bairstow!  57th over: England 161-5 (Bairstow 50, Foakes 21) A wide one drifts from Permaul\u2019s hand and Bairstow pounces, slap-bang to the rope. Balcony appreciation from his teammates.    Updated at 7.38pm GMT    7.21pm    56th over: England 156-5 (Bairstow 46, Foakes 21) Bairstow survives a review, after being hit on the top of the pad by Joseph. An optimistic shout by West Indies - but Bairstow is starting to look cosy in his slippers - it was probably worth a go Like this strategy:.       7.16pm    55th over: England 155-5 (Bairstow 45, Foakes 21) Foakes navigates another Permaul over. I like Permaul\u2019s style, delivering from wide of the crease with a flamboyant arm and a touch of panache.   Updated at 7.23pm GMT    7.13pm    54th over: England 155-5 (Bairstow 45, Foakes 21) Sudden riches as Bairstow plunders ten from Joseph\u2019s over. A slash through a gap in the slips for four, a back foot steer through the covers for another and a determined sprint for two. Very nicely done.      7.10pm    53rd over: England 145-5 (Bairstow 35, Foakes 21) Yet another rapid maiden from Permaul.  Brian Withington is back! \u201cHow predictably tedious of BT to exhume the commentary stylings of David Gower - I guess we should just be grateful that they didn\u2019t extend the favour to the Bard of Brexit.\u201d Oh Brian, I have a to admit to a soft spot for Gower.  Updated at 7.10pm GMT    7.06pm    52nd over: England 145-5 (Bairstow 35, Foakes 21) Young Alzarri Joseph opens the post-tea session with a maiden. We glimpse a few seconds of the ocean, where a white-sailed yacht bobs up and down, the same wind that is billowing shirts on the field.     7.03pm    The players are out and we go again for the final session of the day.     7.03pm   CC Live! fantasty league  For all fans of county cricket, Mes has emailed in with details of a fantasty league for the 2022 season. If you\u2019re interested,  click here and use the code KNKTTEFN.     6.56pm    Pitch talk from David Gower: a bit of bounce, though not a hugely beneficial track for spinners.  You might recognise this crew:      6.49pm    Well, that\u2019s a much better scorecard for England to sup on than lunch\u2019s 57-4. Bairstow has now escorted England safely through two intervals in the stonewalling role. Foakes has been permitted to play his flair card.  \u201cFor a humble \u2018proper\u2019 wicketkeeper, Foakes looks disconcertingly decent with the bat,\u201d writes Brian Withington. \u201cBairstow also offering a more than passing imitation of a specialist red ball batsman - who would have thought he was worth persevering with?\u201d      6.42pm   Tea: England 145-5 (Bairstow 35, Foakes 21)  51st over: England 145-5 (Bairstow 35, Foakes 21) Runs! And four of them, as Foakes leans into Permaul\u2019s fourth ball, which lists onto the leg side, and sends the ball singing over the rope. And that\u2019s tea!     6.39pm    50th over: England 141-5 (Bairstow 35, Foakes 17) Kraigg Brathwaite\u2019s first ball of the match is a pedestrian sponge cake down the leg side which Bairstow regards snottily. His remaining five deliveries are more accurate but can\u2019t tempt Bairstow into something rash. A third maiden on the trot.      6.35pm    49th over: England 141-5 (Bairstow 35, Foakes 17) The umpires examine the ball, but it passes through the special cricketing circumference instruments and Permaul starts his second over with a touch of flair. Foakes pats him back, content to stagnate with tea not so long away.     6.32pm    48th over: England 141-5 (Bairstow 35, Foakes 17) Thank you Tim and for your forbearance over my slow puncture. Holder continues in the sun, while in the stands the camera pans to Sir Viv Richards in tight indigo jeans, looking in fine fettle. His fellow name on the trophy, Sir Ian Botham is also in town, clad in a more billowing shirt. A maiden.     6.29pm    47th over: England 141-5 (Bairstow 35, Foakes 17) It\u2019s Veerasammy Permaul, slow left-arm, and he bowls a tidy over for just a single. That\u2019s me done: on International Women\u2019s Day, it\u2019s high time I handed over to Tanya Aldred. Thanks for your company, your correspondence and your quips about the need for England to drop some more bowlers.     6.24pm    46th over: England 140-5 (Bairstow 34, Foakes 17) Foakes, facing Holder for the first time, keeps busy and flicks for two. We may be about to see some spin...  Updated at 6.25pm GMT    6.20pm    45th over: England 137-5 (Bairstow 33, Foakes 15) Back to the tussle between Foakes and Roach. It\u2019s less gripping this time but still see-sawing, as a nice busy cut for two is followed by a play-and-miss.      6.16pm    44th over: England 135-5 (Bairstow 33, Foakes 13) Seales gives way to Holder, who decides to home in on Bairstow\u2019s pads. His first attempt is too leg-side and goes for four leg-byes; his second brings a strangled appeal, and so does the third. Holder is back in the maidens: 9-6-7-1. \u201cStokes may be out,\u201d says Tom van der Gucht, \u201cbut on the plus side, Woakes is probably due a century.\u201d Ha. This slow pitch might suit him down to the ground.     6.10pm    43rd over: England 131-5 (Bairstow 33, Foakes 13) This over from Roach is a miniature rollercoaster. Foakes edges a fine away-swinger for four, between first and second slip, but short of both. Then he off-drives for four, handsomely. Then he plays and misses. And then he straight-drives for four more! He has raced to 13 off seven balls. Is he playing the innings we always expected from Jos Buttler?     6.05pm    42nd over: England 118-5 (Bairstow 33, Foakes 1) With Stokes gone, we have two right-handers at the crease, and two wicketkeepers. They take a single apiece off Seales as Ben Foakes, back from the wilderness, announces himself with a stylish on-drive, which Roach does well to half-stop at mid-on. \u201cI see,\u201d says Em Jackson, \u201cthe England side have appointed Roger Daltrey as today\u2019s guest coach. Our match tactics seemingly \u2018Meet the new boss, same as the old boss\u2019.\u201d  Updated at 6.05pm GMT    6.00pm    41st over: England 116-5 (Bairstow 32, Foakes 0) It\u2019s now up to Bairstow to hold England together, as he did in his last Test at Sydney, making 113 and 41 and singlehandedly seeing off the threat of an Ashes whitewash. Facing Roach, he goes back to being watchful, taking just a single off the last ball.     5.58pm    40th over: England 115-5 (Bairstow 31, Foakes 0) Stokes had just had another escape, nicking Seales just short of first slip, where John Campbell took it neatly on the half-volley. Stokes responded by smoking the next ball for four, and glancing the one after for four more. It looked as if the disappointment had got to Seales, but with the last ball of the over he dug deep and produced an inspired retort. Stokes battled hard and did well to add 67 with Bairstow, but England could still be skittled here.     5.56pm   Wicket!! Stokes b Seales 36 (England 115-5)  Big moment! Seales gets the breakthrough with a swinging yorker that Stokes can only drag onto his stumps.   Updated at 6.01pm GMT    5.51pm    39th over: England 107-4 (Stokes 28, Bairstow 31) Kemar Roach is back for his third spell. Bairstow treats him with due respect for five balls, then cashes in on a middle-stump half-volley and caresses it to the rope at midwicket. \u201cThat was beautifully timed,\u201d says Butcher.     5.48pm    How did you spend the drinks break? At the risk of being more Guardian than thou, I spent it looking at today\u2019s tweets from the Gender Pay Gap Bot, which has a great angle on International Women\u2019s Day.      5.44pm   Drinks: England in decent hour shock  38th over: England 103-4 (Stokes 28, Bairstow 27) Seales, bowling to Stokes, comes up with an intriguing ball - slanted across him and swinging back in so late that Stokes wonders if he should have played it and Josh da Silva has to change direction to take it. A very high-class dot. And that\u2019s drinks, with England (whisper it) winning the first hour after lunch, but still a long way from being out of the woods.  \u201cWe haven\u2019t had anyone out for a duck yet,\u201d says John Starbuck. \u201cThere must have been a time when a whole England innings was like that, but I\u2019ve no idea when. Barring commentator\u2019s curse, any suggestions?\u201d I\u2019m going to throw that one out to the OBO Massive.     5.38pm    37th over: England 103-4 (Stokes 28, Bairstow 27) Holder pulls himself together and delivers five dots before Stokes steals a quick single to mid-on, digging out a rare yorker.     5.35pm    36th over: England 102-4 (Stokes 27, Bairstow 27) Seales is back already, at the other end, but still being told off for his follow-through. (Give the kid a rest! Get the spinner on!) Stokes off-drives and gets only one for it as there\u2019s a fine diving stop, but it\u2019s enough to bring up the fifty partnership off 19.5 overs. The first six of those overs, as you\u2019ll remember, yielded just three runs. Bairstow celebrates \u2013 and brings up the hundred \u2013 with a cover drive for four, the sixth boundary these two have managed between them in 146 balls. Proper Test creekit.  Updated at 5.35pm GMT    5.29pm    35th over: England 97-4 (Stokes 26, Bairstow 23) Bairstow cuts, not for the first time, but it is the first time he\u2019s really got hold of it. Four more: poor old Holder has gone to pieces.     5.25pm   Stokes reprieved!  34th over: England 93-4 (Stokes 26, Bairstow 19) Stokes, facing Joseph, is missed at second slip! He mistimed a cut, got it off the toe-end of the bat and squirted it low to the left of Jason Holder \u2013 who didn\u2019t move. Either Holder didn\u2019t see it, or he was reeling from the blow of conceding a run.     5.20pm    33rd over: England 89-4 (Stokes 22, Bairstow 19) Jason Holder returns and you\u2019re not going to believe this, but he has conceded a run. In fact two of them, to a cut by Bairstow.     5.18pm    32nd over: England 87-4 (Stokes 22, Bairstow 17) Joseph continues, which is a surprise when he has the long arm of the law hovering over his footmarks. The batters find the gaps with three singles and a two, chopped into the covers by Stokes. \u201cFantastic work as ever with the OBO,\u201d says Oliver Smiddy. Thanks, but I get the feeling you\u2019re softening me up. \u201cGood to see New England is the same as Old England, minus our two best bowlers. I\u2019m looking forward to us having a proper keeper though for the first time in forever.\u201d Bit harsh on Jos Buttler, who only had one bad series that I remember. \u201cMight I solicit a plug please? I\u2019m cycling 100 miles with a bunch of colleagues to raise money for Smart Works, a UK charity which helps women find work by providing suitable clothing and coaching for interview. If any generous OBO readers would care to donate, they can do so here. My firm will match any donations so effectively they count double!\u201d From a glance at the Smart Works website, it looks as if The Big Give will match them too.     5.12pm    31st over: England 82-4 (Stokes 19, Bairstow 15) Jayden Seales keeps attracting the attention of Joel Wilson, inspecting his footmarks, but he doesn\u2019t appear to have had a warning yet. He manages a maiden with just a leg-bye to add to the total.     5.07pm    30th over: England 81-4 (Stokes 19, Bairstow 15) Joseph hasn\u2019t got the memo. He drops short, twice, and Stokes shovels for two, also twice.    Updated at 5.23pm GMT    5.05pm    29th over: England 77-4 (Stokes 15, Bairstow 15) Just a single, nudged to leg by Stokes, as Seales puts the plug in.  Updated at 5.07pm GMT    4.59pm    28th over: England 76-4 (Stokes 14, Bairstow 15) Stokes hooks Joseph, making a good sound but only getting a single as there\u2019s a man out at deep square. Joseph beats Bairstow outside off, possibly with a bit of help from the wind. \u201cThe breeze was pretty strong at the start,\u201d Mark Butcher reports, \u201cbut it\u2019s really whistling across the ground now.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m a little worried,\u201d says Phil Russell, \u201cthat if England keep on having these batting collapses, they are going to run out of bowlers to drop.\u201d  Updated at 5.07pm GMT    4.55pm    27th over: England 75-4 (Stokes 13, Bairstow 15) Stokes is getting giddy now, on-driving Seales for three. Bairstow punches into the covers for a couple to join him in double figures. And then gets away with a top edge! The ball stuck in the pitch and ended up looping over the keeper for four more. That\u2019s 18 in this session so far at a run a ball: we need to know what these two had for lunch.     4.50pm    26th over: England 66-4 (Stokes 10, Bairstow 9) And four from Stokes too! Going back to force Joseph away past point. He adds a straight push for a single that takes him to double figures after 49 balls. I wonder if Brathwaite has made his first mistake of the day, dishing up inexperience at both ends, rather than bringing Holder back.  Updated at 4.51pm GMT    4.46pm   A four!  25th over: England 61-4 (Stokes 5, Bairstow 9) Jayden Seales returns, bearing a friendly bouncer, which Bairstow pulls for four well in front of square. That\u2019s the first boundary since Dan Lawrence\u2019s last one, 12 long overs ago. The PA marks the moment with a burst of Hey Ya.     4.42pm    \u201cJust recovering from The Merchant of Venice at The Globe,\u201d says Gary Naylor, \u201creflecting on parallels between Shakey\u2019s play and Test cricket. Both have a terrible beauty, ruthlessly expose human fallibility and deliver brutal outcomes. And, try as you might, you just can\u2019t look away.\u201d Ha. (But surely there\u2019s only one Shaky.)     4.40pm    \u201cWell, this is fun,\u201d says Geoff Wignall. \u201cI imagine much England self-congratulation over having had the wisdom to shorten the tail by the removal of Branderson.\u201d Ha. Their batting was the one good reason to get rid of them.     4.03pm   Lunch: England 57-4  24th over: England 57-4 (Stokes 5, Bairstow 5) After that spasm of excitement, Bairstow just wants to make it through to lunch. And he succeeds by playing out five dots from Joseph and then clipping the last ball for another single. The morning belongs firmly to West Indies and above all Kemar Roach, but England, thanks to some self-denial from Stokes and Bairstow, still have a chance of recovering from their traditional collapse.  \u201cReassuring,\u201d says Colum Fordham, \u201dto see that despite the wholesale changes to the team England have maintained their unrivalled penchant for calypso collapso against good fast bowling. Plus \u00e7a change, plus c\u2019est la m\u00eame chose. With a swinging Dukes ball doing plenty in the capable hands of Roach, Holder et al, I\u2019m sure Broad and Anderson will appreciate the wisdom of leaving them at home. The tricky job of saving England\u2019s bacon is going to fall on the shoulders of Stokes, Foakes and all those blokes. So much for the reset. To pick up on Kaan\u2019s remark earlier, it was a grade A hoax.\u201d   Updated at 4.55pm GMT    3.57pm    23rd over: England 56-4 (Stokes 5, Bairstow 4) Roach drops short for once and Bairstow cuts, still carefully, for two. He adds a tuck for a single, so this partnership, which was three off six overs, has now raced to eight off seven.     3.53pm    22nd over: England 53-4 (Stokes 5, Bairstow 1) Holder comes off, so he can relish his immaculate figures (5-5-0-1) over lunch. Joseph returns and Stokes, venturing down the track, clips him for two \u2013 though he also risks a leave that is about three inches from doing to him what it did to Root. \u201cThis England Test side\u2019s reboot is going quite well,\u201d says Abhijato Sensarma. \u201cWhat with, you know, them embracing the Hollywood-esque practice of rehashing the same plotlines, just with different actors...\u201d     3.48pm    21st over: England 51-4 (Stokes 3, Bairstow 1) With a quarter of an hour to go till lunch, Kraigg Brathwaite strokes his chin and wonders how he can make the morning even more of a misery for England. Ah yes, a little burst of Roach, who has the most Test wickets of anyone on this ground (41, apparently). He\u2019s on the spot but Bairstow keeps him out. Bairstow and Stokes seem to be following Michael Vaughan\u2019s advice from before the match: give the first hour to the bowler.  Updated at 3.50pm GMT    3.44pm    20th over: England 51-4 (Stokes 3, Bairstow 1) The bowler is Holder. In the immortal words of Bryan Ferry, you can guess the rest.     3.41pm    19th over: England 51-4 (Stokes 3, Bairstow 1) Stokes plays tip-and-run, going up on his toes and dropping a lifter from Joseph into the crease. Mark Butcher is at the mic \u2013 still the OBO\u2019s favourite commentator \u2013 and he notes that there is more swing in the Caribbean now than there was when he was playing for England (in the only series they\u2019ve won there in half a century, in 2003-04). Today the swing is more pronounced as there\u2019s a strong crosswind, which helped Holder get the movement that did for Lawrence.  Updated at 3.42pm GMT    3.35pm    18th over: England 50-4 (Stokes 2, Bairstow 1) Another over from Holder, another maiden. \u201cHey Tim,\u201d says Edward Wilson, \u201ctwo Aussie guys from Mannheim, Germany here.\u201d Love it. \u201cUtterly surprised we can watch this live on TV. Dunno if it\u2019s sunspots or we\u2019re tapping a satellite. Beautiful warm and sunny day and I could go a G&amp;T but partner has to sing in Britten\u2018s Turn of the Screw at Heidelberg Opera tonight so it\u2019s delayed until tomorrow.\u201d Love it even more. \u201cGower\u2019s commentary okay but much prefer The Guardian OBO. Keep at it! Cheers, Edward Wilson &amp; Christopher Diffey.\u201d     3.32pm    17th over: England 50-4 (Stokes 2, Bairstow 1) Stokes, facing Joseph, manages to take his second single from his 28th ball; Bairstow takes his first from his fourth. England will be fine as long as these two put on 150.      3.28pm    16th over: England 48-4 (Stokes 1, Bairstow 0) There\u2019s a hold-up, not sure why, before Jonny Bairstow can face the last two balls of Holder\u2019s over. He blocks one and leaves the other. Holder\u2019s figures are ridiculous: 3-3-0-1. Who does he think he is, Jimmy Anderson?  \u201cI don\u2019t think it should surprise anyone,\u201d says Mike Wakeman, \u201cthat a callow and inexperienced England batting line-up is struggling away from home against a strong bowling attack with minimal preparation. Test cricket is supposed to be really hard!\u201d Yes, but it doesn\u2019t help if you shove all your rookies into the top four.     3.22pm   Wicket! Lawrence c Blackwood b Holder 20 (England 48-4)  Another one! Holder sets his trap, bowling full and swinging it away. Lawrence falls into it, edging with hard hands, and Jermaine Blackwood finally holds onto a catch \u2013 third slip, third time lucky.   Updated at 3.24pm GMT    3.18pm    15th over: England 48-3 (Lawrence 20, Stokes 1) Joseph tries a bit of rib music. Lawrence hears it coming and tucks behind square for a single.     3.13pm    14th over: England 47-3 (Lawrence 19, Stokes 1) Holder keeps Stokes quiet and beats him outside off \u2013 twice. After two overs, Holder has yet to concede a run. When Root said it would be a tricky first session, he wasn\u2019t wrong.     3.09pm    13th over: England 47-3 (Lawrence 19, Stokes 1) It\u2019s a double change as the man of the morning, Roach, takes a breather with figures of 6-1-28-2. Alzarri Joseph comes on and has Lawrence edging again first ball, but safely through the cordon for four. A worse delivery brings a better shot, a clip for three, and then Stokes gets off the mark by nudging his 14th ball off his hip.   Updated at 3.11pm GMT    3.02pm    12th over: England 39-3 (Lawrence 12, Stokes 0) Now we do have a change as Seales (5-3-11-1) gives way to Jason Holder. His Test bowling average in the Caribbean is 21 \u2013 almost as good as the man commentating, Curtly Ambrose. Holder is just as tall as Sir Curtly, if not as fast or fearsome. He dishes up four balls of line\u2019n\u2019length, one half-volley which Stokes can only smack to short extra, and a jaffa that beats him outside off. And that\u2019s drinks, with a brave new England in a right old mess.  Updated at 3.07pm GMT    2.57pm    11th over: England 39-3 (Lawrence 12, Stokes 0) Brathwaite keeps Roach on, understandably, and perhaps regrets it as the first ball of this over is a dud on leg stump, flicked away for four by Lawrence. But Roach retorts with a much better ball, seaming away, taking the edge \u2013 and Lawrence is dropped. The culprit, as with Root, is Jermaine Blackwood at third slip. \u201cAnother fail by England\u2019s opening batters,\u201d says Steffi Steffenson. \u201cSack the bowlers.\u201d     2.52pm    10th over: England 30-3 (Lawrence 4, Stokes 0) Lawrence, facing Seales, gets a ball on his legs at last and works it away for three. Bowling to Stokes for the first time, Seales produces a perfect inswinger to the left-hander, followed by a nasty bouncer. Stokes meets these different challenges with a rock-solid block and a last-ditch sway.  \u201cIs it too late,\u201d asks Ed Rostron, \u201cto just call this whole thing off and fly them all home?\u201d  Updated at 2.55pm GMT    2.47pm    9th over: England 27-3 (Lawrence 1, Stokes 0) To be fair to Root, it was a superb bit of bowling from Kemar Roach \u2013 not just the skill to bring the ball back sharply into the off bail, but the character to bounce straight back from having a catch dropped.   Updated at 2.49pm GMT    2.44pm   Wicket!! Root b Roach 13 (England 27-3)  Bowled playing no stroke! After being dropped off the previous ball, slashing to third slip. Root goes off shaking his head. The red-ball reset is beginning with a calypso collapse.   Updated at 2.48pm GMT    2.41pm    8th over: England 23-2 (Root 9, Lawrence 1) Another maiden from Seales, who beats Lawrence with the last ball even though it appears to move back in. The amount of movement should bring some cheer to Chris Woakes, who badly needs some wickets.     2.39pm    7th over: England 23-2 (Root 9, Lawrence 1) In an astonishing development, England take a single \u2013 in fact two. Root dabs Roach into the on side, whereupon Lawrence takes the hint and gets off the mark with a back-foot push into the covers.. One of the many things this team have to work on is their running between the wickets: only Jonny Bairstow is really good at it, and in Tests he comes in too late to set the tone. To celebrate these modest steps forward, Root clips Roach to the midwicket boundary.     2.33pm    6th over: England 17-2 (Root 4, Lawrence 0) Another maiden as Seales finds some more of that shape outside off. Dan Lawrence looks busy but can\u2019t get off the mark. To go with the gloating Aussie, we now have a fuming Pom. \u201cWhat will it take for England just to pick their best XI?\u201d demands Ian Batch. \u201cThe always arrogant England have once again not picked their strongest team for a Test match. So, I hope they lose.  \u201cRoot should\u2019ve been sacked, and dropping Broad and Anderson for the sake of it was ridiculous, especially when Robinson is not yet fit enough, not just for this match, for Test cricket generally. Why no Parkinson instead of Leach? How can Woakes take the new ball away from home? I could go on and on but why bother, I\u2019ll just cheer on the West Indies.\u201d     2.29pm    5th over: England 17-2 (Root 4, Lawrence 0) Root plays out a maiden from Roach, who is enjoying keeping up the pressure. On a day of firsts, we have the first gloating Aussie of the series. \u201cThe match didn\u2019t start until 1am here in Melbourne,\u201d says Tony Hastings, \u201cbut I figured I could fit in a few English wickets before heading off to bed. Disappointed that Root only has to come in at bugger all for 1 instead of bugger all for 2 now though.\u201d  Updated at 2.31pm GMT    2.25pm    4th over: England 17-2 (Root 4, Lawrence 0) So this new England find themselves in a rather familiar predicament. Jayden Seales earned that by getting his length spot-on in this over after overpitching at first. \u201cA fantastic over,\u201d says Steve Harmison, who knows a bit about bowling in the Caribbean.  Updated at 2.27pm GMT    2.22pm   Wicket! Crawley c da Silva b Seales 8 (England 17-2)  Another one! And it\u2019s a great catch, as Joshua da Silva has to change direction sharply and take it low to his left. Not a great shot by Zak Crawley, who drove loosely and got an inside edge through a wide-open gate.   Updated at 2.31pm GMT    2.20pm    3rd over: England 17-1 (Crawley 8, Root 4) So Joe Root is in rather early \u2013 well, he\u2019s used to that. He gets off the mark with a very Root stroke, the square force that is all touch and no force at all. Bar one no-ball, England are getting \u2019em in boundaries. \u201cKudos to Kaan for his minstrelsy,\u201d says Gabriel Munns. picking up on Rob Lewis\u2019s email at 13:49. \u201cI\u2019d just add that if those three blokes are seen buying Cokes from some other folks, we could turn the whole Test match into a Dr. Seuss book.\u201d      2.15pm   Wicket! Lees LBW b Roach 4 (England 12-1)  No edge, though the ball was close to the bat. That left Lees hoping he\u2019d been struck outside the line, but it was umpire\u2019s call. His first Test innings was good while it lasted, but it only lasted nine balls. It was typically shrewd bowling by Roach, finding just enough movement back in after three outswingers.    Updated at 2.30pm GMT    2.11pm   Wicket!? Lees given LBW b Roach 4 (England 12-1)  This looks out, is given out, but Lees reviews, perhaps hoping for the thinnest of inside edges...     2.10pm    2nd over: England 12-0 (Lees 4, Crawley 8) The new ball is shared by Jayden Seales, a young man in such a hurry that he has played more Tests (five now) than other first-class games (three). And taken more Test wickets (16) than other first-class ones (seven). He\u2019s pacey but the pitch is not. Zak Crawley, standing outside his crease, plays a straight drive and a cover drive, both for four, both handsome. Seales finishes with a better ball, shaping away from a good length, but Crawley picks the swing and leaves it.     2.04pm    1st over: England 4-0 (Lees 4, Crawley 0) Kemar Roach takes the new ball, from round the wicket, and Alex Lees faces his first ball in Tests. It\u2019s the best thing he could wish for short of a freebie on his legs: an easy leave outside off, swinging away but going through very slowly. He plays the second ball, a solid block. And he gets off the mark to the fourth, seeing some width and square-driving for four past gully. A comfortable start.     2.00pm    Both sides take the knee. This is greeted, thank goodness, by a respectful round of applause.     1.58pm    The players link arms for the anthems. They\u2019re all in black armbands in memory of the two late greats, Rod Marsh and Shane Warne. It\u2019s good to see, but an even better tribute to Warne would have been to pick a leg-spinner on this bare surface. He advised England to pick Matt Parkinson in Brisbane, and was rather proved right by what happened to Jack Leach there.      1.55pm    \u201cNow that, Tim ...\u201d says David Horn, \u201c*that* was a top-notch preamble.\u201d Too kind! \u201cCan\u2019t wait for the series to start. I\u2019m picturing Jimmy and Stuart-y sitting back in their chairs, arms folded, and saying \u2018Right. Get out of this if you can.\u2019\u201d Ha. I\u2019d pay good money to get access to their WhatsApps.     1.53pm    \u201cDon\u2019t disparage Alex Lees as a blocker,\u201d says Mark Douglas on Twitter. \u201cHe was brilliant alongside Graham Clark in the Royal London cup last season so he can bat a bit. Saying that, if he blocks his way to a big score I will be made up.\u201d I didn\u2019t mean it as an insult at all, just an observation based on his Boycottian 65 in England\u2019s warm-up game.      1.49pm    Here\u2019s Rob Lewis with a line from his son Kaan, who is 12. \u201cStokes, Foakes and Woakes?\u201d says Kaan. \u201cIt must be a hoax.\u201d     1.47pm    \u201cI\u2019m in the unusual situation,\u201d says Lewis Clarke, \u201cof following this Test on OBO whilst my Dad (on holiday... alright for some :-)) is able to attend his (first?!) Test match in person. Anyway, hello Dad, and here\u2019s to a cracking game.\u201d Hear, hear and hello, Lewis\u2019s Dad.     1.45pm    The match is on BT Sport in the UK and their latest recruit is Sam Billings. He may be setting a new world record for the time taken to go from Test cricketer to Test pundit: one match. \u201cTest cricket,\u201d he tells us, \u201cis all about character. It\u2019s more important than technique.\u201d      1.41pm   Teams: West Indies  A minor surprise from Kraigg Brathwaite as he leaves out Kyle Mayers. He will have five proper bowlers at his disposal, whereas Joe Root will have four plus two halves in himself and Ben Stokes. West Indies 1 Kraigg Brathwaite (capt), 2 John Campbell, 3 Shamarh Brooks, 4 Nkrumah Bonner, 5 Jermaine Blackwood, 6 Jason Holder, 7 Joshua da Silva (wkt), 8 Alzarri Joseph, 9 Kemar Roach, 10 Veerasammy Permaul, 11 Jayden Seales.  Updated at 1.42pm GMT    1.36pm   Teams: a new England  Six changes from their last Test at Hobart.  England 1 Zak Crawley, 2 Alex Lees, 3 Joe Root (capt), 4 Dan Lawrence, 5 Ben Stokes, 6 Jonny Bairstow, 7 Ben Foakes (wkt), 8 Chris Woakes, 9 Craig Overton, 10 Mark Wood, 11 Jack Leach.     1.34pm   Toss: England win and bat  Joe Root calls right and opts to bat first, although \u201cit\u2019s going to be challenging for the first session.\u201d     1.33pm    The first email of the series comes from Andrew Benton. \u201cIt was a bit surprising that Root kept the captaincy,\u201d he reckons. \u201cThere is the impression that he\u2019s a bit smug about that, and the Ashes failure was all other people\u2019s fault... Hopefully his days are numbered anyway and he\u2019ll be replaced later this year. If this series is lost with anything less than a truly competitive, gripping performance from England, then that should happen very soon.\u201d     1.32pm    Alex Lees has been presented with his cap by Jonny Bairstow. (No such moment for Saqib Mahmood, so he must be the 12th man.) Lees is the 700th man to play Test cricket for England, and the umpteenth to be invited to open the batting since the days of Strauss and Cook.      1.01pm   Preamble: the morning after  Hello everyone and welcome to the first Test. It\u2019s not just the first Test of a new series, which is always mouth-watering: it\u2019s the first test of a new England. This is the morning after the night of the long knives.  Gone are the head coach, the head coach\u2019s boss, the batting coach, the opening pair that played most of the Ashes series, the No 3 who was there throughout, the No 6 who was supposed to be a rising star, the regular wicketkeeper and sometime vice-captain \u2013 oh, and the two most prolific seamers in England\u2019s history. And yet they still have the same captain, fresh from ten defeats in the past 15 Tests. So the question is: was it the night of the wrong knives?  Today we begin to find out the answer. Joe Root and Ben Stokes, the sole survivors from the top seven that started the Ashes, are joined by Zak Crawley, a dasher just emerging from a dreadful year; Alex Lees, a blocker making his Test debut; Dan Lawrence, a talented understudy now thrust into centre stage at No 4; and Jonny Bairstow, the bit-part player who ended up as England\u2019s best batter in Australia.  The gloves go back to Ben Foakes, who becomes England\u2019s fifth Test keeper in the past ten months: after Bracey, Buttler, Bairstow and Billings, it feels like Buggins\u2019 turn. But Foakes is a class act, silkier than the rest. The new ball, owned by Anderson and Broad for the past 14 years, will be handed to Chris Woakes and, for the first time, Craig Overton. Both are skilful bowlers and useful batters, but in Australia one of them was at his worst and the other couldn\u2019t get a game even when England were falling apart. Will they feel the faith Root is suddenly placing in them, or the pressure he is putting them under?  First change will be Mark Wood, who is super-fast and a top-class tourist but recuperating from illness and prone to injury. The fourth specialist bowler is likely to be the lone spinner in the XII, Jack Leach, who tends to struggle in the first innings of a Test. The senior bowler is now Stokes, who is still getting over a side strain. It all adds up to a set of gambles that could easily turn into a shambles. West Indies\u2019 line-up is even less seasoned yet slightly more settled. There are only four men in this match with a Test bowling average under 30, and every one of them is a West Indian. Kemar Roach is a proper leader of the pack, Jayden Seales an exciting beginner, Jason Holder a superb third seamer, Alzarri Joseph a rapid back-up, Kyle Mayers a handy medium-pacer. The batting feels more fallible, although the captain, Kraigg Brathwaite, arrives on a high after making a career-best 276 for Barbados against Jamaica, and England saw in the T20 series that when Mayers hits the ball, it stays hit.  On paper this looks like a low-scoring dogfight. But the Viv Richards Stadium is the most draw-friendly ground in the Caribbean with only five results in its ten Tests to date. The pitch is apparently shorn, so it could be flat and slow \u2013 though there are showers about that should freshen it up for the fast bowlers. Play starts at 10am in Antigua, 2pm GMT, and I\u2019ll be back about 25 minutes before that with the toss and the teams.  "

                    "body": "  4.36am    Here\u2019s Megan Swanick\u2019s full report from tonight\u2019s match at the Estadio Nacional de Costa Rica.      4.14am   Final Concacaf World Cup qualifying standings  28 Canada (goal difference +16)28 Mexico (+9)25 USA (+11)---25 Costa Rica (+5)---21 Panama 11 Jamaica(-10)10 El Salvador(-10)4 Honduras(-a lot) After all that fuss and clamor over Tata Martino\u2019s job, Mexico finished with 28 points. And the four points the USA took from Mexico look pretty good right now, especially after the team dropped points to El Salvador, Jamaica and Panama. The so-called Golden Generation has made it through one of the biggest grinds in the sport. The experience will only help them.  So now they move on to their biggest challenge -- negotiating a collective bargaining agreement that guarantees equal pay with the women. And then the World Cup, assuming immunological and sociopolitical issues don\u2019t infringe on the party. Good night, good morning, and enjoy the rest of your club seasons.      4.02am    David Archibald writes: Bad news: There is no bad news. Costa Rica will easily beat New Zealand. I suppose you were that confident that Italy would beat North Macedonia too? A one off game. Don\u2019t forget, NZ hasn\u2019t lost a game at the WC since 1982. (See I can make stupid comments too :-0) Berklee College of Music football. Still unbeaten. FWIW, I was present when New Zealand\u2019s women earned their first point at the World Cup with a late two-goal comeback against Mexico. The coach of that New Zealand team? John Herdman. He now coaches the top men\u2019s team in Concacaf, even if their equalizer in Panama was taken away by VAR.     3.57am   Full time: Costa Rica 2-0 USA  Give some credit to Costa Rica, which I\u2019ve already predicted will easily beat New Zealand and qualify for the World Cup yet again, but that\u2019s two straight games in which their home mystique, rather than the players, accounted for their win. They\u2019re not better than Canada, whom they beat six days ago, and they were not better than the USA tonight. The narrative forming already is that the USA barely qualified. And that\u2019s basically true. But this team improved through the cycle, arguably outplaying three of their top four opponents (two on the road) in their last three games. Berhalter needs to come up with some better ideas on set pieces, and the goalkeeping job is wide-open. Better to learn that now than later. Oh -- and the US men have qualified for the World Cup.     3.54am    Cameron Parkhurst emails re: Pulisic - \u201cFrom what I observed most of his free kicks and corner kicks were poorly taken tonight. The corners were generally hit too long.\u201d They did at least have Miles Robinson open on a couple of those long corner kicks early, but Costa Rica figured that out eventually, and the rest of the free kicks and corners accomplished nothing.     3.51am    90 min: We\u2019ll have four minutes of stoppage time. So if Costa Rica can score one goal per minute ...     3.49am    88 min: I think we can agree the USA is about to qualify for the World Cup unless the referee decides to add about 30 minutes of stoppage time.     3.49am    86 min: De la Torre springs free and puts in a tame effort. Costa Rica races the other way, and Martinez gets just enough space to put in a decent shot. Steffen gets the save. Canada now tied with Panama.     3.45am    84 min: And that\u2019s all for Pulisic. Jordan Morris is in. Good performance from the Chelsea man aside from the set pieces.     3.43am    81 min: \u201cUS in search of a consolation goal,\u201d our commentators say. Let\u2019s get this straight. Costa Rica getting four goals in barely more than 30 minutes was feasible, but the USA getting two in 10 is impossible?  A goal in the next few minutes is not \u201cconsolation.\u201d It\u2019s a comeback. But the pace has slowed. Both teams may be resigning themselves to their fates.     3.41am    80 min: Also, Jose Ortiz replaces Bennette.     3.40am    78 min: Keylor Navas has come off. Tweaked his leg getting his foot to the ball on that US attack earlier. Esteban Alvarado is the replacement. That\u2019ll improve the odds of the USA getting a deserved result here.     3.39am    77 min: Fair point about dead legs here ...  That said, the USA has been the more active side for the last 20 minutes as much as it has been the whole game. Meanwhile, Keylor Navas has to get attention from the trainers.     3.36am    75 min: Every minute that ticks away reduces the chances of any drama in terms of qualification, but the big takeaway here may be Zach Steffen losing the goalkeeping job:      3.34am    71 min: Or not. The USA maintains possession, Reyna plays Pulisic into space on the left, it\u2019s crossed back to the top of the box, and Musah blasts a shot deflected out for a corner. The corner kick, of course, is squandered. The USA has conceded two goals on set pieces and shown little sign of scoring on their own. Blame a decade of US youth coaching in which working on set pieces was considered bad for development.     3.32am    70 min: Somewhere along the way, Yeltsin Tejeda replaced Waston. Ah, Boris Yeltsin. Simpler times. Free kick coming up that will be squandered.     3.30am    69 min: Foul called on Ferreira for ... standing in Navas\u2019 way. Seems harsh.     3.29am    68 min: Speaking of Pulisic, the USA earns its eighth and ninth corner kicks. Douglas Lopez makes his debut for Costa Rica, replacing Brandon Aguilera. The corner kicks accomplish nothing.     3.28am    Brad Wilson writes: \u201cBeing an USA fan who doesn\u2019t give a damn about Chelsea, rather the opposite, I hope Pulisic plays until his manager deems a substitution advisable, if ever. Poor megaclubs whining about international football ... my heart breaks.\u201d Normally, I\u2019d agree, and I think there\u2019s too much international football. But this is a crowded international window, and Pulisic just has a target on his legs. Forget Chelsea -- US fans also don\u2019t want to see him hurt.     3.27am    66 min: Adrian Martinez replaces Mora. CBS commentators hyping the possibility of Costa Rica daring to dream now. I\u2019m one of the biggest pessimists in the world, and I don\u2019t see it happening.     3.26am    63 min: Finally, a yellow card for a foul on Pulisic, who is still in there. Mora is the unlucky party. Former MLS defender Kendall Waston is down for Costa Rica. OK, at last, those USA subs are ... Gio Reyna for Weah (pity -- I\u2019d love to see them together) Jesus Ferreira for Pepi Shaq Moore for Yedlin, a bit surprising since Yedlin should be fresh after missing the last game.     3.23am    61 min: USA subs ... Several. Our feeds are painfully slow with such news, but I\u2019ll update.     3.22am   GOAL: Costa Rica 2-0 USA (Contreras 59)  Sloppy, sloppy, sloppy. Steffens handles a set piece badly. He saves the follow-up, but the ball bounces clear, and a mishit cross lands on the feet of two Costa Rican attackers kept onside by a defender at the other post. Yeesh.     3.20am    Shocker in Panama ... the home side is up 1-0 on Canada. Sure, the game means little to the group winners, but ...     3.19am    57 min: Navas parries a Pepi shot. That\u2019s six shots on goal for the USA to two for Costa Rica. Safe to say Navas has been the more impressive of the goalkeepers on the field.     3.17am    55 min: USA reasserting control of the game, having given up a goal very much against the run of play. The Costa Rican team and crowd surely know they\u2019re not qualifying tonight, but beating the USA is always a point of pride, hence the long celebration ...      3.13am   GOAL: Costa Rica 1-0 USA (Vargas 51)  Corner kick, man streaking through the box unmarked, header, goal. Getting five more still seems unlikely, but the USA\u2019s chances of breaking their losing streak in Costa Rica just took a hit.     3.10am    48 min: CHANCES for the USA. Free kick finds Miles Robinson, whose header forces a good leaping save from Navas. Weah can\u2019t quite get enough on his shot to poke it through, but the danger still isn\u2019t cleared until Zimmerman puts his shot over the bar.     3.09am    46 min: Luca de la Torre, who made a good impression against Panama, has replaced Tyler Adams, who shook off an early injury but probably doesn\u2019t need to take any more chances now. Costa Rica fouls ... Pulisic. You guessed it. This is why persistent infringement exists in the Laws.     2.59am    Big day for women\u2019s football Two momentous occasions to celebrate: 1. 91,553 people went to the Camp Nou to see Barcelona beat Real Madrid 5-2 for an 8-3 aggregate win in the Champions League. 2. The Guardian has a new newsletter.  Sign up for our new and free women\u2019s football newsletter      2.58am    The doors keeps closing for Costa Rica ... Mexico\u2019s now up 2-0 on El Salvador. Jamaica is up 2-1 at home against Honduras in a matchup of the bottom two in the eight-team group. The most surprising halftime score on paper is 0-0 in Panama, but the hosts have been eliminated and visiting Canada will win the group.     2.52am   Halftime: Costa Rica 0-0 USA  Somehow, I don\u2019t think Costa Rica is going to get six goals. The visitors have actually looked like the more likely team to score.      2.50am    44 min: Another USA corner kick.      2.48am    42 min: On the question of when to sit Pulisic -- there\u2019s no need to worry about yellow-card accumulation, per World Cup regulations:    Single yellow cards and pending suspensions as a consequence of cautions received in different matches in the preliminary competition of the FIFA World Cup 2022\u2122 are not carried over to the final competition. Pending match suspensions imposed as a result of a direct or an indirect red card in matches in the preliminary competition of the FIFA World Cup 2022\u2122 are carried over to the final competition.   Meanwhile, for the sake of variety, Costa Rica fouls Weah rather than Pulisic.     2.46am    40 min: Steffen is called into action again to punch a Costa Rican corner clear. If you\u2019re wondering if the fact that we can hear US coach Gregg Berhalter yelling from the bench is a sign of the home crowd going quiet or Berhalter just being that loud, the answer is yes.     2.44am    38 min: While we\u2019re in a lull in what has been a better game than expected, vote in my poll, won\u2019t you?      2.42am    35 min: Costa Rica finally gets a shot on goal, with Brandon Aguilera letting one rip from outside the box, but Steffen isn\u2019t troubled.     2.39am    33 min: Yedlin somehow beats his man on the right and fires in a cross. Turns out the ref was playing advantage, because Costa Rica fouled, you guessed it, Christian Pulisic. Chelsea management must hate these games.     2.37am    30 min: Some danger now, with Bennette controlling the ball on the left flank and unleashing a decent cross. The USA regains possession, and Antonee Robinson shanks a cross ... toward the far upper corner of the goal, where Navas has to tap it over for another corner kick. This one yields another strong shot, but it doesn\u2019t get through the traffic, just like DC drivers dealing with the truckers\u2019 convoy. Or DC drivers every other day.     2.34am    27 min: Jedi Robinson takes off to lead a USA counter. Costa Rica is gambling with this press, but they have to. Speaking of presses -- stop the presses. Christian Pulisic has been fouled.     2.32am    25 min: Extended possession for Costa Rica now. Obviously, I spoke too soon. But the ball floats into the area, and a header arcs up into the sky before falling into Steffen\u2019s arms. Here\u2019s your Mexico goal:  And here\u2019s a not-goal in Costa Rica:       2.29am    22 min: Another corner kick, and it once again finds Miles Robinson. His header sails well over the ball. Tyler Adams, apparently feeling a bit better, breaks up a Costa Rica attack. Has the USA had a better quarter of a game in Costa Rica in the last, I don\u2019t know, 10 years? 20? Ever?     2.27am    20 min: GOOOOOOOOAAALL ... ... in Mexico. 1-0 for the home side, further damaging Costa Rica\u2019s second unlikely path to qualification tonight.     2.25am    19 min: Eat my shorts ...  So far, the USA is coping well with the Costa Rica press. Will that change as fatigue from a busy international window sets in?     2.24am    17 min: Musah is tripped ... well, no, he\u2019s not, but the ref thought he was ... about 25 yards out, and it\u2019s a free kick. Acosta takes it despite the presence of Pulisic, and it slams into the wall.     2.21am    15 min: Your score updates from other Concacaf games: 0-0, 0-0, 0-0. Like the old joke says -- \u201cI can tell you the score of any game before it starts.\u201d     2.19am    13 min: CHANCE and it\u2019s Weah setting things up again, springing Pepi in the box. It\u2019s an acute angle, but Pepi forces Navas to make another save. And it\u2019s another corner kick.     2.17am    10 min: The first significant Costa Rica attack yields a corner kick. Zimmerman clears. A follow-up shot zips just over the bar. Now Costa Rica unleashes a vicious press. Could be a great counterattacking opportunity if the USA can create some space.     2.14am    8 min: CHANCE for the USA, and that stung Navas\u2019 hands. The corner kick sails over the crowd to Miles Robinson, who has a little bit of time to settle the ball and rip a scorching ball on target. Navas spills it toward the goal but has plenty of time to collect. If you believe the best defense is a strong offense -- first of all, you\u2019re right, and second of all, you\u2019re happy so far. (If you\u2019re rooting for the USA.)     2.13am    7 min: Tim Weah gets his first meaningful touches, and he already looks dangerous. Hard to believe the USA racked up five goals without him. Corner kick now.     2.12am    6 min: Some bad news for the USA now -- Tyler Adams, the midfield engine, is moving around in some discomfort. Possible subs are warming up.     2.11am    4 min: Make it two shots on goal from the USA, though neither has particularly troubled the longtime Real Madrid goalkeeper. This one is a Miles Robinson header off a Pulisic corner.     2.09am    2 min: A half-chance for the USA, with a cross from \u201cJedi\u201d Robinson (sometimes called Antonee) catching Ricardo Pepi in a tight space in the area, and his shot is lobbed into the air and caught by Navas.     2.07am    Yes, we\u2019ll keep an eye on the Mexico-El Salvador game just in case the unthinkable happens and Costa Rica can advance ahead of Mexico. Kickoff in Costa Rica, where the crowd doesn\u2019t seem to realize their team more or less conceded direct qualification already. But they may still get a result, which they would surely celebrate.     2.03am    National anthems ... Lots of whistling during the USA anthem. Costa Rica\u2019s team could use some singing lessons. And now ... fireworks.     1.41am    Further underscoring the B-team feel of the Costa Rica lineup:       1.39am   Costa Rica lineup  There\u2019s a hitch here. Nine players are facing yellow-card accumulation-related suspensions, and Costa Rica is very likely to have one more qualifying game. It\u2019s safe to say that affected selection.  So the object appears to be to sit back and see what transpires. If Los Ticos somehow conjure up a few goals, they can toss Bryan Ruiz and Joel Campbell into the mix. If not, well, with no major players suspended, they can take care of New Zealand. Lineup ... Goalkeeper: Keylor Navas (Paris Saint-Germain) Defenders: Ian Lawrence (Alajuelense), Juan Pablo Vargas (Millonarios), Kendall Waston (Saprissa), Daniel Chacon (Cartagines), Carlos Martinez (San Carlos) Midfielders: Brandon Aguilera (Alajuelense), Orlando Galo (Herediano), Jewison Bennette (Herediano), Carlos Mora (Alajuelense) Forward: Anthony Contreras (Guanacasteca)       1.20am   USA lineup  This is no B team. It\u2019s arguably better than the starting XI that beat Panama 5-1, thanks in part to the return of DeAndre Yedlin and Tim Weah. The captain is an interesting choice -- not Christian Pulisic or Tyler Adams but Walker Zimmerman. Starters ... Goalkeeper: Zack Steffen (Manchester City) Defenders: DeAndre Yedlin (Inter Miami), Walker Zimmerman (Nashville SC), Miles Robinson (Atlanta United), Antonee Robinson (Fulham) Midfielders: Kellyn Acosta (LAFC), Tyler Adams (RB Leipzig), Yunus Musah (Valencia)  Forwards: Ricardo Pepi (Augsburg), Christian Pulisic (Chelsea), Tim Weah (Lille)     1.12am   Preamble  Let\u2019s look at this game from Costa Rica\u2019s point of view ... Good news: This game is in Costa Rica, where the home team has beaten the USA in 1996, 1997, 2000, 2001, 2005, 2009, 2013 and 2016. Bad news: Costa Rica needs to beat the USA by six goals. Good news: Costa Rica beat the USA 4-0 in 2016. Bad news: J\u00fcrgen Klinsmann is no longer the USA\u2019s coach. That 2016 defeat was one of the last straws. Bad news: Four is still less than six. Bad news: Costa Rica has only scored 11 goals in 13 World Cup qualifiers. (That\u2019s why they\u2019re in this position in the first place.) Good news: Costa Rica can still get in with a win, a Mexico loss and a four-goal swing in goal difference. Bad news: Mexico is playing at home. Against El Salvador. Good news: The fourth-place Concacaf team will face Oceania champion New Zealand in an intercontinental last-chance qualifier. Bad news: There is no bad news. Costa Rica will easily beat New Zealand.     1.00am    Beau will be here shortly. In the meantime, here\u2019s how the US got on against Panama:  With all due respect to the Disney marketing department, the most magical place on the planet was a few miles northeast of Orlando\u2019s theme parks on Sunday night. That\u2019s how Exploria Stadium must have felt to the US and their exuberant fans, at least, as a Christian Pulisic hat-trick helped deliver a 5-1 thrashing that hoisted Gregg Berhalter\u2019s men to the brink of Qatar 2022. A tricky and occasionally torturous qualifying campaign is now all but certain to enjoy a happy ending. Of course, the US know from agonising experience that weird things can happen on the final night of Concacaf qualifying, after an easy win over Panama at the home of Orlando City. But in all probability this will not be a case of history repeating. Unlike in 2017, the US can afford a loss in their final fixture, away to Costa Rica on Wednesday. In fact, they can afford a big loss. Even a five-goal defeat would not be fatal given the gap in goal difference between them and Costa Rica in fourth. The result eliminated fifth-placed Panama from contention, meaning that the US can finish no lower than fourth, the rank that entails an intercontinental playoff in Qatar in June, probably against New Zealand.

Thanks for following along and you can find our latest report on Rishi Sunak here:\n\n\n\n\n 6.37pm  \n\nLord McDonald, a former senior civil servant, said the reappointment of Suella Braverman as home secretary was a \u201cpolitical\u201d move by Rishi Sunak.\nSunak has been criticised for rehiring Braverman less than a week after she was sacked over a security breach.\nLord McDonald, who was head of the diplomatic service, said it was \u201cnot at all\u201d dishonourable for Sunak to ensure all factions were represented in his cabinet.\nAsked if six days on the backbenches was a short sentence for a breach of any kind, in civil service terms, he told the BBC: \u201cIt is, and six weeks is a rather short time to claim that that person had acquired massive and irreplaceable experience.\n\u201cSo it looks political, it is political, but this is within the prime minister\u2019s judgment and gift.\u201d\nLabour MP Chris Bryant has criticised Braverman for avoiding questions about her resignation.\n\n\nUpdated at 6.40pm BST\n\n\n 6.31pm  \n\nSir Keir Starmer met Bill Gates in parliament on Wednesday.\nThe billionaire Microsoft co-founder and Starmer discussed a range of issues including climate change and global health.\nA Labour spokesperson said: \u201cKeir Starmer was pleased to meet with Bill Gates today and discuss a number of issues of mutual concern including how the UK best supports global health and equitable development, and how we use the goal of net zero to invest in science and technology to deliver the jobs and growth of the future.\u201d\n\nUpdated at 6.40pm BST\n\n\n 6.22pm  \nDUP says it is 'ready' for new Stormont elections as Northern Ireland deadline nears\n\nThe DUP is \u201cready to fight\u201d in fresh Assembly elections, its leader, Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, said following talks with the Northern Ireland secretary Chris Heaton-Harris.\nHeaton-Harris was holding discussions with Stormont leaders as a deadline for calling another election in the region approaches.\nThe NI secretary has repeatedly warned that he will call a Stormont poll if Friday\u2019s deadline passes without a devolved executive being formed.\nThe DUP has refused to engage with the devolved institutions in Belfast in the wake of May\u2019s assembly election, meaning it has not been possible to form an executive.\nThe party\u2019s boycott is part of a campaign of opposition to the post-Brexit Northern Ireland Protocol and it says it will not return to power sharing until decisive action is taken to remove the protocol\u2019s economic barriers on trade between Great Britain and Northern Ireland.\nDonaldson told reporters in London there was \u201cstill some way to go\u201d in solving the problems over the protocol following his phone conversation with Heaton-Harris.\n\nUpdated at 6.41pm BST\n\n\n 6.13pm  \nOnline safety bill dropped, reports say\n\nThe online safety bill has been dropped from Commons business for the second time in four months despite pledges it would return \u201cin the autumn\u201d, PoliticsHome is reporting.\nThe bill was expected to have its third reading in the Commons on 1 November.\nThese stages were originally meant to take place in July but the process was delayed after the resignation of Boris Johnson as PM.\nThe Labour MP Lucy Powell has criticised the delay in light of the findings at the inquest of Molly Russell last month.\n\n\nUpdated at 6.41pm BST\n\n\n 6.01pm  \n\nJames Cleverly has been criticised by Labour for urging LGBT football fans to be \u201crespectful\u201d of Qatar if they visit the country for the World Cup which starts on 20 November.\nChris Bryant MP tweeted: \u201cRespect is a two way street. My worry is these ministers never say boo to authoritarian regimes where human rights are regularly trampled under foot.\n\u201cIf Qatar want to be accepted in the community of nations, they have to respect all communities of all nations.\u201d\nAnd Steve Reed, the shadow justice secretary, tweeted:\n\n\nUpdated at 6.42pm BST\n\n\n 5.49pm  \n\nArriving for talks with secretary of state Chris Heaton-Harris in Belfast, Sinn F\u00e9in\u2019s Michelle O\u2019Neill urged the DUP to drop its block on forming an executive.\n\u201cSo the clock is obviously ticking and we\u2019re very close to the Friday deadline,\u201d she said.\n\u201cI\u2019m here to meet the secretary of state and my number one priority is the restoration of the executive, that should also be the secretary of state\u2019s priority.\n\u201cThe people here deserve no less than a fully functioning executive, one that is going to get them get through the cost of living crisis, one that\u2019s going to fix and invest in our health service \u2013 that\u2019s where we need to be.\n\u201cAs this deadline looms it\u2019s just not acceptable for the DUP not to join the rest of us but they have an opportunity tomorrow and it\u2019s up to them to take that opportunity.\u201d\n\nUpdated at 6.39pm BST\n\n\n 5.39pm  \n\nKevin Foster, who was appointed minster of state at the Department for Transport last month by Liz Truss, has announced he is leaving the role after talks with Rishi Sunak.\n\n\n\n\n 5.30pm  \n\n\nRishi Sunak\u2019s boast at a Tunbridge Wells summer garden party of undoing Labour policy that \u201cshoved all the funding into deprived urban areas\u201d to give more to regions such as Kent looks likely to haunt him as his commitment to levelling up is questioned.\nAt Sunak\u2019s first prime minister\u2019s questions on Wednesday, the Labour leader, Keir Starmer, challenged him over the clip, filmed during the previous Conservative leadership race, which seemed to show his pride in diverting money from poor cities to wealthier towns such as Tunbridge Wells.\n\u201cI managed to start changing the funding formulas to make sure that areas like this are getting the funding they deserve,\u201d Sunak tells Tory party members at the summer event.\nTunbridge Wells is one of the UK\u2019s most affluent towns in one of the least deprived counties in England. Starmer asked why Sunak did not now \u201cdo the right thing and undo the changes he made to those funding formulas\u201d?\n\n\n\n\n\n 5.14pm  \n\nRishi Sunak and his family plan to move back into Downing Street.\nHe lived in the No 10 flat when he was chancellor in Boris Johnson\u2019s government, while the former PM inhabited the roomier No 11 flat.\nThe PM\u2019s spokesperson told Sky News: \u201cThey will be moving into the No 10 flat, where they used to live.\u201d\nAsked why No 10 and not the bigger No 11, she said: \u201cThey were very happy there.\u201d\n\nUpdated at 5.40pm BST\n\n\n 5.02pm  \n\nJames Duddridge has now tweeted to confirm that he was asked to leave his role as minister for international trade.\nHe said he was \u201cdisappointed\u201d but that he would be giving Rishi Sunak his \u201cfull support\u201d from the backbenches.\n\n\nUpdated at 5.40pm BST\n\n\n 5.00pm  \nSummary of the day so far\n\nHere\u2019s a roundup of today\u2019s developments:\n\nRishi Sunak has been accused of immediately breaking his pledge to restore government integrity by bringing Suella Braverman back as home secretary in exchange for a key endorsement for his leadership bid. Labour and the Liberal Democrats called for a Cabinet Office inquiry into national security concerns after Braverman, who was reinstated despite admitting leaking official documents.\nFracking will in effect remain banned under Sunak\u2019s government, his spokesperson confirmed on Wednesday, saying the new prime minister was committed to the policy in the 2019 manifesto. The confirmation came after the prime minister told the Commons that he \u201cstands by\u201d the manifesto, which put a moratorium on shale gas extraction.\nMinisters are to re-examine the pensions triple lock and increasing benefits in line with inflation over the next fortnight, according to No 10, after Sunak delayed the announcement of the government\u2019s fiscal plans from 31 October to 17 November. The Treasury has said the new date will now be a full autumn statement.\nThe Northern Ireland secretary, Chris Heaton-Harris, is holding last-ditch talks with the region\u2019s party leaders to try to restore devolved government and avert an assembly election. If the meetings in Belfast on Wednesday do not yield a breakthrough by Thursday that revives power sharing, Heaton-Harris is expected to call an election, tipping Northern Ireland into further uncertainty.\nWomen\u2019s groups have reacted with concern and anger over the low representation of women in the new cabinet. Sunak removed 11 members of his predecessor\u2019s top team on Tuesday as he put together a cabinet that he said \u201creflects a united party\u201d by showcasing \u201call the talents\u201d. Under the changes, however, fewer than a quarter of all people \u2013 about 23% \u2013 able to attend cabinet meetings will be women.\nThe foreign secretary James Cleverly has been criticised for telling gay football fans they should show respect to Qatar, which criminalises their sexuality, when attending the World Cup in the emirate. Cleverly said Qatar was willing to make compromises to allow people it would normally persecute to attend the tournament, which kicks off on 20 November.\n\n\nUpdated at 5.40pm BST\n\n\n 4.43pm  \nAlec Shelbrooke leaves as defence procurement minister\n\nAlec Shelbrooke says he will be returning to the back benches and leaving his role as a minister of state for defence procurement.\n\n\n\n\n 4.41pm  \nJames Duddridge sacked as trade minister\n\nJames Duddridge has lost his job as trade minister as Rishi Sunak continues his government reshuffle.\nDuddridge said he had told Sunak that he would support the government \u201cloyally\u201d from the back benches. \n\n\n\n 4.28pm  \n\nWomen\u2019s groups have reacted with concern and anger over the low representation of women in the new cabinet.\nRishi Sunak removed 11 members of his predecessor\u2019s top team on Tuesday as he put together a cabinet that he said \u201creflects a united party\u201d by showcasing \u201call the talents\u201d. Under the changes, however, fewer than a quarter of all people \u2013 about 23% \u2013 able to attend cabinet meetings will be women.\nThis is down from nearly a third at the start of Liz Truss\u2019s premiership and is lower than under Boris Johnson, at 24%, and Theresa May, at 30%. The figure has been falling since its highest ever rate under Tony Blair in 2006-07, when the proportion of women in cabinet was 36%.\n\n\u201cWomen remain significantly underrepresented in parliament where just 34% MPs are women and, while progress has been made, the pace is glacial,\u201d said Amy Whitelock Gibbs, the interim director of policy at the Fawcett Society. \n\nWe need to ensure women, from all backgrounds, are not just in the halls of Westminster but also around the cabinet table.\n\nGibbs said the presence of female MPs in the rooms of power where decisions were being made had \u201cundoubtedly transformed our laws and policies\u201d, from equal pay to domestic violence legislation.\n\nThat is why, as the cost-of-living crisis intensifies and has a disproportionate impact on women, we were disappointed to see the proportion of women in cabinet drop. We urge the government to put women at the heart of its economic recovery.\n\nRead the full story here:\n\n\n\n\n 4.06pm  \n\nA spokesperson for the Labour leader, Sir Keir Starmer, has said there are \u201cconversations ongoing\u201d between Labour\u2019s chief whip and the MP Nadia Whittome regarding a tweet that said Rishi Sunak becoming prime minister \u201cisn\u2019t a win for Asian representation\u201d.\nIn a tweet that has since been deleted, Whittome said Sunak becoming PM \u201cisn\u2019t a win for Asian representation\u201d due to his wealth and politics. She added \u201cblack, white or Asian: if you work for a living, he is not on your side\u201d.\nThe Labour leader\u2019s spokesperson has confirmed that Whittome was instructed to delete the tweet, adding that Sunak becoming the first British Asian prime minister was a \u201cgreat thing\u201d and something the country \u201cshould be proud of\u201d.\nAsked about Whittome\u2019s tweet on Sky News, Starmer said he was \u201cvery pleased\u201d to welcome the first British Asian PM and described it as a \u201creal milestone\u201d for the country.\n\n\nUpdated at 4.28pm BST\n\n\n 3.54pm  \n\nOn becoming Tory leader this week, Rishi Sunak said:\n\nIt is the greatest privilege of my life to be able to serve the party I love, and give back to the country I owe so much to.\n\nDuring his final prime minister\u2019s questions in the summer, Boris Johnson said:\n\nThe last few years have been the greatest privilege of my life, and it\u2019s true that I helped to get the biggest Tory majority for 40 years and a huge realignment in UK politics.\n\nAnd Keir Starmer, when elected as leader of Labour in 2020, intoned:\n\nIt is the honour and privilege of my life. I will do my utmost to guide us through these difficult times, to serve all our communities and to strive for the good of our country.\n\nIt appears that owning up to your privilege is all the rage. Confessing to this sort of privilege is a shameless humblebrag. Some onlookers might suppose, after all, that the greatest privilege of Sunak\u2019s life is owning many millions of pounds. Does the phrase even aspire to work as rhetorical misdirection, to distract the listener from whatever other privileges the speaker might have enjoyed?\nWe unpack the real meaning of the most overused word in politics. Read the rest of the story here:\n\n\nUpdated at 4.01pm BST\n\n\n 3.38pm  \n\nRishi Sunak\u2019s first appearance at PMQs was a strong performance that will force the Labour leader Keir Starmer to raise his game, Sebastian Payne from the Financial Times writes.\n\n\n\n\n 3.17pm  \n\nScotland\u2019s deputy first minister, John Swinney, has criticised the chancellor Jeremy Hunt\u2019s decision to delay the government\u2019s fiscal plans, claiming the \u201cunwelcome and unnecessary\u201d postponement would \u201csimply create more uneconomic uncertainty\u201d.\nThe delay risked affecting the Scottish government\u2019s own budget plans \u201cas we will now need to wait two and a half weeks longer than previously proposed to see what the effect of UK tax and spending plans will be on devolved budgets\u201d, he said.\nHe added:\n\nAbove all, it is essential that the chancellor heeds warnings not to impose renewed austerity, which would only worsen the extreme pressures already being faced by people and businesses as a result of inflation, rising interest rates and other economic factors.\nThe Scottish parliament will be kept informed regarding the timing of the Emergency Budget Review statement and will be consulted on any potential impact the UK government\u2019s delay will have on the timing of the 2023-24 Scottish budget.\n\n\nUpdated at 3.30pm BST\n\n\n 3.11pm  \n\nThe shadow work and pensions secretary, Jonathan Ashworth, has responded to Rishi Sunak\u2019s refusal to commit to the triple lock on state pensions. He said:\n\nOlder people are paying the price for the Conservatives\u2019 economic mess. Rishi Sunak stood on a manifesto in 2019 on a pledge to keep the triple lock.\nNow he\u2019s threatening that promise to Britain\u2019s retirees. With pensioners struggling under the Conservatives cost of living crisis, it\u2019s clear that Rishi Sunak is not on their side.\n\n\nUpdated at 3.18pm BST\n\n\n 3.08pm  \n\nThe foreign secretary, James Cleverly, has been criticised for telling gay football fans they should show respect to Qatar, which criminalises their sexuality, when attending the World Cup in the emirate.\nCleverly said Qatar was willing to make compromises to allow people it would normally persecute to attend the tournament, which kicks off on 20 November. On Tuesday the prominent British LGBTQ campaigner Peter Tatchell claimed he had been arrested in Qatar for highlighting the country\u2019s stance.\n\nCleverly said:\n\nI have spoken to the Qatari authorities in the past about gay football fans going to watch the World Cup and how they will treat our fans and international fans. They want to make sure that football fans are safe, secure and enjoy themselves. And they know that that means they are going to have to make some compromises in terms of what is an Islamic country with a very different set of cultural norms to our own.\nOne of the things I would say for football fans is, you know, please do be respectful of the host nation. They are trying to ensure that people can be themselves and enjoy the football, and I think with a little bit of flex and compromise at both ends, it can be a safe, secure and exciting World Cup.\n\nThe shadow digital, culture, media and sport secretary, Lucy Powell, called Cleverly\u2019s comments \u201cshockingly tone-deaf\u201d.\nShe said:\n\nSport should be open to all. Many fans will feel they can\u2019t attend this tournament to cheer on their team because of Qatar\u2019s record on human rights, workers and LGBT+ rights. The government should be challenging Fifa on how they\u2019ve put fans in this position, and ensuring the full safety of all fans attending, not defending discriminatory values.\n\nRead the full story here:\n\n\nUpdated at 3.09pm BST\n\n\n 2.48pm  \n\nRishi Sunak\u2019s commitment to reinstate the fracking ban has neutralised one of Labour\u2019s key attack lines, as it is hugely unpopular in the marginal seats they hope to contest in the next election, but Ed Miliband, the shadow climate secretary, did not seem impressed by the promise.\nHe said:\n\nLast week Rishi Sunak voted against Labour\u2019s fracking ban, but this week his spokespeople tell us he is in favour of the temporary moratorium on fracking in the Conservative manifesto.\nWhatever their latest position, the truth is that that the Tories have shown that they cannot be trusted on the issue of fracking. The only way to guarantee that fracking will be banned for good is to elect a Labour government.\nAnd by doubling down today on the onshore wind ban, Rishi Sunak is showing that he offers more of the same after twelve years of failed Conservative energy policy, which has made energy bills too high for families and weakened Britain\u2019s energy security.\u201d\n\n\nUpdated at 2.52pm BST\n\n\n 2.45pm  \n\nStarmer also challenged Rishi Sunak over his decision to reappoint Suella Braverman as home secretary, after her resignation just one week ago.\n\n\nUpdated at 2.48pm BST\n\n\n 2.33pm  \n\nKeir Starmer launched an attack on Rishi Sunak at PMQs, pointing out the new prime minister lost the initial Tory leadership race to Liz Truss \u201cwho herself got beaten by a lettuce\u201d.\n\n\nUpdated at 2.41pm BST\n\n\n 2.18pm  \n\nFracking will remain effectively banned under Rishi Sunak\u2019s government, his spokesperson confirmed on Wednesday, saying the new prime minister was committed to the policy in the 2019 manifesto.\nThe confirmation came after the prime minister told the Commons that he \u201cstands by\u201d the manifesto which put a moratorium on shale gas extraction.\nThe decision is another rebuff to policies launched under Liz Truss, as well as full rewriting of her fiscal plans. Under Truss\u2019s short-lived government, she lifted the moratorium amid significant divisions in the parliamentary party.\nA significant number of MPs, including in the cabinet, have spoken out against fracking, including the chancellor Jeremy Hunt who said in June that it would create \u201cenormous disruption and environmental damage for little if any economic benefit\u201d.\nRead the full story here:\n\n\n\n\n 2.16pm  \n\nThe government is now spending almost \u00a37 million a day housing asylum seekers in hotels and the cost could continue to rise, MPs heard.The Commons Home Affairs Committee was told \u00a35.6 million a day was being spent on hotels for people who have arrived in the UK and have submitted a claim, with an additional \u00a31.2 million paid to house Afghan refugees who fled the Taliban takeover while long-term accommodation is sought, PA reports. The total \u00a36.8 million is over \u00a32 million more than the government said it was spending in February (\u00a34.7 million).Asked by committee chairwoman Dame Diana Johnson if the cost was likely to go up again, Abi Tierney, director general of the passport office and UK visas and immigration, replied: \u201cYes.\u201d MPs also learned the Home Office has only processed 4% of asylum claims by those who crossed the Channel last year and officials admitted the interception rate made by French police of those attempting the journey has fallen.Concerns were also raised about conditions at the Manston Airport site in Kent, which is meant to be a short-term holding facility to process migrants when they arrive in the UK.MPs heard the number of people arriving was \u201coutstripping\u201d the capacity of the site and some were being held there for as long as a month, compared with the 24 hours intended.\n\n\n\n 1.55pm  \n\nSir Keir Starmer\u2019s spokesperson has said that Labour wants the cabinet secretary to offer a substantive response to its letter about Suella Braverman after the shadow home secretary, Yvette Cooper, wrote to Simon Case demanding an investigation \u201cinto the extent of this and other possible security breaches\u201d.\nHe said: \n\nClearly, if there is content of the inquiry that has to be retained, that is understandable. If there was advice that went to the prime minister that there was a raised eyebrow within the civil service about this appointment, then absolutely that is something that should be in the public domain. It is perfectly possible to do that whilst preserving any operational matters that could be compromised in doing so.\n\n\nUpdated at 2.01pm BST\n\n\n 1.47pm  \n\nThe Northern Ireland secretary, Chris Heaton-Harris, is holding last-ditch talks with the region\u2019s party leaders to try to restore devolved government and avert an assembly election.\nIf the meetings in Belfast on Wednesday do not yield a breakthrough that revives power-sharing on Thursday Heaton-Harris is expected to call an election, tipping Northern Ireland into further uncertainty.\nGloom shrouded the talks because the Democratic Unionist party (DUP) has vowed to continue its boycott of the Stormont executive unless the party\u2019s objections to the post-Brexit Irish Sea border are resolved.\n\nThe impasse raised the spectre of an election in December, which parties and voters do not appear to want, just seven months after the last one. Sinn F\u00e9in overtook the DUP as the biggest party in the May election, a landmark result, but its deputy leader, Michelle O\u2019Neill, did not become first minister because the DUP\u2019s boycott.\nThe crisis has deepened a sense of political malaise in Northern Ireland and raised questions about the viability of power-sharing institutions established by the 1998 Good Friday agreement. The assembly has not functioned for four of the past six years.\nHeaton-Harris, who was reappointed to his post by Rishi Sunak on Tuesday, has repeatedly warned he would call an election if no executive was formed by 28 October, a legal deadline. He repeated the threat on Wednesday.\nRead the full story here:\n\n\nUpdated at 1.51pm BST\n\n\n 1.41pm  \n\nThe Guardian\u2019s Aubrey Allegretti has the full report on Rishi Sunak\u2019s first PMQs:\nRishi Sunak has been accused of immediately breaking his pledge to restore government integrity by bringing Suella Braverman back as home secretary in exchange for a key endorsement for his leadership bid.\nComing under pressure in his first prime minister\u2019s questions, Sunak did not deny that civil servants had raised concerns about one of the most senior roles handed out in his cabinet reshuffle on Tuesday.\nKeir Starmer, the Labour leader, questioned Sunak\u2019s commitment to probity and professionalism after Braverman was brought back into the government despite \u201cdeliberately pinging around sensitive Home Office documents\u201d from a personal email account.\nStarmer said Sunak was \u201cso weak he\u2019s done a grubby deal trading national security because he was scared to lose another leadership election\u201d, vocalising a concern some Conservative MPs have raised privately over the past 24 hours.\nBraverman was forced to quit last week for breaching the ministerial code, and three days later, after Liz Truss\u2019s government had collapsed, endorsed Sunak. The move was seen as a crucial win for Sunak, allowing him to demonstrate he had support from the right of the party.\nStarmer asked Sunak if she had been right to resign last week, and said the home secretary\u2019s integrity and professionalism should be \u201cbeyond question\u201d.\nThe prime minster said Braverman had made an error of judgment and recognised her mistake, adding: \n\nThat\u2019s why I was delighted to welcome her back into a united cabinet that brings experience and stability to the heart of government.\n\nAsked if officials had raised concerns about the appointment, given the cabinet secretary, Simon Case, was said to have been furious, Sunak dodged the question and said he had already \u201caddressed the issue\u201d. Starmer said the evasion showed that while there was a \u201cnew Tory at the top\u201d, Sunak had demonstrated he would put the \u201cparty first and country second\u201d.\nRead the full report here:\n\n\n\n\n 1.38pm  \n\nHere\u2019s the clip of the chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, confirming that his fiscal statement has been postponed until 17 November.\nIt was previously scheduled for 31 October but will now be a \u201cfull autumn statement\u201d to reflect the \u2018most accurate possible economic forecasts\u2019, he said.\n\n\nUpdated at 1.51pm BST\n\n\n 1.34pm  \n\nAnd here are some more lines from Downing Street, including that Rishi Sunak will appoint a new independent adviser on ministerial interests.\n\n\nUpdated at 1.36pm BST\n\n\n 1.30pm  \n\nThe chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, is seeking to fill a fiscal shortfall of \u00a335bn when he delivers his autumn statement next month, officials have told Bloomberg.\nThe government has drawn up a menu of 104 options to cut spending as they seek to get the public finances back onto a sustainable track, according to the officials.\n\nUpdated at 1.52pm BST\n\n\n 1.28pm  \n\nHere are some more lines from the Downing Street briefing, from the Guardian\u2019s Jessica Elgot.\n\nDowning Street declined to get into reports that officials were concerned over the reappointment of Suella Braverman as home secretary.\nAsked if officials had raised concerns about the matter, a No 10 spokesperson said:\n\nI don\u2019t as standard get into discussing the advice that ministers nor prime ministers receive from their officials, that would not be proper, but certainly I don\u2019t recognise reports as regards the cabinet secretary.\n\nThey added that the PM is not committing to the triple-lock on state pensions. The spokesperson said:\n\nThat is something that is going to be wrapped up into the fiscal statement, we wouldn\u2019t comment ahead of any fiscal statements or budgets.\nBut what I can say is he has shown through his record as chancellor is that he will do what\u2019s right and compassionate for the most vulnerable.\n\n\nUpdated at 1.52pm BST\n\n\n 1.26pm  \n\nThe moratorium on fracking has been restored, Downing Street has now confirmed.\nThe PM\u2019s official spokesperson said Rishi Sunak was committed to the effective ban on fracking set out in the Conservative party\u2019s 2019 general election manifesto.\n\n\n\n 1.24pm  \n\nLabour has called for an investigation into Rishi Sunak\u2019s comments during the summer Tory leadership election on funnelling public money out of \u201cdeprived urban areas\u201d.\nThe shadow levelling up secretary Lisa Nandy has written to her counterpart, Michael Gove, asking for an independent investigation to establish which funding formulas were changed, the New Statesman reports.\nSunak was filmed speaking to Conservative party members in Tunbridge Wells over the summer where he admitted taking money from deprived urban areas in order to give it to other parts of the country.\nIn her letter, Nandy wrote:\n\nThe Conservative government was elected in 2019 on a flagship promise to level up parts of the country that had experienced relative economic decline.\n[Sunak\u2019s claim] could not be more serious. The prime minister has admitted that when he was chancellor, he fixed the rules to funnel taxpayers\u2019 money from \u2018deprived\u2019 to more affluent parts of the country. This is the complete opposite of levelling up. The prime minister has no mandate from the electorate to reverse the commitments made in 2019. His admission undermines the trust and confidence of the public and shatters the legitimacy of this government. It is a warning sign that Rishi Sunak is not on the side of working people.\n\nJake Berry, who yesterday left his role as Conservative party chair ahead of Sunak\u2019s cabinet reshuffle, said Sunak \u201csays one thing and does another\u201d.\n\n\nUpdated at 1.53pm BST\n\n\n 1.16pm  \nSunak 'to reinstate ban on fracking'\n\nRishi Sunak has said he will reinstate the nationwide ban on shale gas fracking during his first PMQs.\nSunak told MPs he \u201cstands by\u201d the Conservative party\u2019s 2019 manifesto commitment that banned fracking, a ban that was lifted by his predecessor Liz Truss.\nSunak\u2019s pledge came after a question by the Green party MP Caroline Lucas, who later tweeted this:\n\nA government source has confirmed to the Financial Times that Truss\u2019s decision on allowing fracking will be reversed.\n\nUpdated at 1.17pm BST\n\n\n 1.10pm  \n\nRishi Sunak answered questions from the Labour leader, Keir Starmer, at PMQs for the first time.\nHere is the exchange in full:\n\n\nUpdated at 1.13pm BST\n\n\n 1.03pm  \n\nThe shadow home secretary, Yvette Cooper, gave a blistering speech in the Commons after PMQs, claiming the appointment of home secretary, Suella Braverman, was a matter of the \u201cprotection of our national security\u201d.\nBraverman appeared to have left the chamber before Labour\u2019s urgent question about her resignation and reappointment.\nThe home secretary had \u201crun away from basic accountability to this hhouse\u201d, Cooper said. She added:\n\nMy questions are about security breaches and the protection of our national security. They are questions to the home secretary who was here just five minutes and who left.\n\nMinister for the Cabinet Office Jeremy Quin answered Cooper\u2019s question instead, saying that the home secretary had made an \u201cerror of judgment\u201d and then \u201crecognised her mistake\u201d and \u201ctook accountability\u201d for her actions.\nQuin said:\n\nThe ministerial code allows for a range of sanctions where mistakes have been made. The home secretary recognised her mistake, raised the matter and stepped down. Her resignation was accepted by the then prime minister. Ministerial appointments are a matter solely for the prime minister. \n\nHe said it was time to \u201clook to the future\u201d and that the PM had appointed a team of ministers to lead the country through the issues it faced.\n\nUpdated at 1.11pm BST\n\n\n 12.54pm  \n\nStephen Kinnock (Lab) accuses Sunak of being prepared to \u201cshamelessly swap red boxes for political support\u201d.\nHe says there are \u201cserious consequences to all this horse trading\u201d and asks whether Sunak sought advice on security concerns about Gavin Williamson \u201cgiven he was sacked in 2019 for leaking sensitive information related to our national security?\u201d\nSunak says this happened four years ago, when Labour was busy supporting Jeremy Corbyn \u2013 who had wanted to \u201cabolish the nuclear deterrent, leave Nato and scrap our armed forces\u201d \u2013 and that he will not take any lectures on national security.\n\nUpdated at 12.57pm BST\n\n\n 12.50pm  \n\nRichard Burgon (Lab) says Sunak knows only too well that the super-rich can easily afford to pay more in taxes.\nHe says a nurse would have to work \u201cover 20,000 years\u201d in order to match Sunak\u2019s vast wealth. He adds:\n\nRather than announce a new wave of cuts and austerity, wouldn\u2019t it be fairer for the prime minister to introduce wealth taxes on the very richest in our society?\n\nSunak says the government will always support hard-working nurses, which is why it is introducing bursaries and providing more training and \u201cvery strong pay increases\u201d.\nHe adds that future \u201cdifficult decisions\u201d will be approached in a way that is \u201cfair and compassionate\u201d.\n\nUpdated at 12.56pm BST\n\n\n 12.43pm  \n\nSuella Braverman has left the Commons as the shadow home secretary, Yvette Cooper, asks an urgent question on Braverman\u2019s reappointment.\n\n\nUpdated at 12.55pm BST\n\n\n 12.42pm  \n\nJanet Daby (Lab), who describes the Tory government as \u201ctopsy turby\u201d, says her inbox has been full of emails from constituents writing about their wages simply not going far enough, as well as emails about rents, energy prices and mortgages going up. \nShe says her constituents have been writing to her to demand a general election and asks the PM when there will be an election.\nSunak replies that he has already addressed the subject, but that \u201cinflation is the enemy\u201d. He adds:\n\nIt makes everyone poorer, it erodes savings. That\u2019s why it will be a priority of our government to grip and reduce inflation and provide support to those who need it as we do.\n\n\n\n\n 12.36pm  \n\nThe Green Party MP Caroline Lucas asks if Sunak will reverse the green light Liz Truss gave to fracking.\nThe PM says he is proud that his government passed the landmark environmental act for the natural environment and that he is committed to delivering on all those ambitions.\nSunak says:\n\nWe will deliver on what we said at Cop because we care deeply about passing our children and environment in a better state than we found it ourselves.\n\n\nUpdated at 12.39pm BST\n\n\n 12.32pm  \n\nBlackford says Sunak appointed Suella Braverman to the Home Office because of a \u201csleazy backroom deal\u201d to shore up his own position. He describes the move as \u201ca return to the sleazy and scandal and ghosts of cabinets\u201d.\nHe asks the PM if he will admit his mistakes and sack Braverman for her data breach.\nIn response, Sunak says he was pleased to have spoken with Scotland\u2019s first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, last night and that he wishes to work constructively with the Scottish government.\n\nUpdated at 12.40pm BST\n\n\n 12.28pm  \nSunak refuses to commit to raising benefits in line with inflation\n\nThe SNP leader at Westminster, Ian Blackford, congratulates Sunak on becoming the first British Asian prime minister. The symbolism of this achievement is to be \u201cwarmly welcomed\u201d by everyone, he says.\nHe asks Sunak if he will reassure people and guarantee that benefits will rise in line with inflation in his upcoming budget.\nSunak does not answer the question directly, but says he has \u201calways acted in a way to protect the most vulnerable\u201d.\nHe adds that he will \u201ccontinue to act like that in the weeks ahead\u201d, but does not commit to a rise.\nSunak says:\n\nI always acted in a way to protect the most vulnerable that\u2019s because it is the right thing to do and those are the values of our compassionate party.\nI can absolutely reassure him and give him that commitment that we will continue to act like that in the weeks ahead.\n\n\nUpdated at 12.29pm BST\n\n\n 12.25pm  \n\nSunak says he is the first to admit that mistakes were made. He says the difference between him and the Labour leader is that he was honest over the summer about the difficulties the country faced, but Starmer was not.\nHe says:\n\nHe promised his party he would borrow billions and billions of pounds, he told his party what it wanted to hear. Leadership is not selling fairy tales, it is confronting challenges and that is what the public will get from this government.\n\nStarmer uses his final question to call for a general election. He points out that Sunak was beaten in the summer leadership contest by Liz Truss \u2013 who herself was \u201cbeaten by a lettuce\u201d.\nHe says:\nHe claims he wants to level up the north but then he posts about trying to funnel vital investment away from deprived areas.\nStarmer adds:\n\nHe\u2019s not on the side of working people. That\u2019s why the only time he ran in a competitive election he got trounced by the former prime minister who herself got beaten by a lettuce.\n\n\nUpdated at 12.28pm BST\n\n\n 12.21pm  \n\nStarmer says Sunak \u201cpretends he\u2019s on the side of working people\u201d. In private, he says something \u201cvery different\u201d, the Labour leader says.\nHe goes on to talk about the video which emerged in the summer of Sunak in Tunbridge Wells saying he diverted public money from \u201cdeprived urban areas\u201d.\nStarmer asks:\n\nRather than apologise or pretend he meant something else, why doesn\u2019t he do the right thing and undo the changes he made to those funding formulas?\n\nSunak responds by saying that Starmer \u201crarely leaves north London\u201d. He adds:\n\nIf he does, he will know that there are deprived areas in our rural communities, in our coastal communities, and across the south.\n\n\n\n\n 12.18pm  \n\nStarmer goes on to attack Sunak on non-dom statuses, saying the government \u201callows very rich people to live here but register abroad for tax purposes\u201d. He says:\n\nI don\u2019t need to explain to the prime minister how non-dom status works \u2013 he already knows all about that.\n\nHe calls for the PM to get rid of such statuses, adding:\n\nWhy doesn\u2019t he put his money where his mouth is?\n\nIn response, Sunak says he will \u201chave to take difficult decisions to restore economic stability\u201d \u2013 and says more will be revealed in the autumn statement.\nHe says the goverment will always protect the most vulnerable, as it did in Covid.\n\nUpdated at 12.24pm BST\n\n\n 12.16pm  \n\nStarmer says Sunak has \u201cdone a grubby deal\u201d trading national security because he was scared to lose another leadership election. \nThere may be a new Tory at the top but with Tories, it\u2019s always \u201cparty first, country second\u201d, Starmer says. \nSunak responds to Starmer\u2019s assertion and suggests perhaps the Labour leader should explain why a few years ago he was supporting the member of Islington North, a reference to Jeremy Corbyn.\n\n\n\n 12.14pm  \n\nSunak replies he has already addressed the issue of the home secretary\u2019s reappointment.\nSunak says he hopes Starmer will welcome the news today that there are \u201cover 15,000 new police officers\u201d on our streets and that the home secretary will support them to tackle burglaries.\nMeanwhile, he says, Labour \u201cwill be backing the lunatic protesting fringe that are stopping working people carrying on with their lives\u201d.\n\n\n\n 12.13pm  \n\nStarmer points out that Sunak pledged integrity, professionalism and accountability in his statement outside Downing Street yesterday. He says:\n\n But then, with his first act, he appointed a home secretary who was sacked by his predecessor a week ago for deliberately pinging around sensitive Home Office documents from her personal account. \n\nStarmer goes on to say that his experience running the Crown Prosecution Service means he knows firsthand how important it is to have a home secretary \u201cwhose integrity and professionalism are beyond question\u201d.\nHe asks if officials have raised concerns about his decision to appoint Braverman.\n\n\n\n 12.10pm  \nBraverman 'made an error of judgment', says Sunak\n\nStarmer asks Sunak if Suella Braverman was right to resign last week for breach of security. Sunak replies:\n\nThe home secretary made an error of judgment but she recognised that she raised the matter and she accepted her mistake.\n\nBraverman will be focused on \u201ccracking down on criminals, on defending our borders\u201d, he adds.\n\nUpdated at 12.12pm BST\n\n\n 12.08pm  \n\nThe Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer welcomes Rishi Sunak and says the first British Asian prime minister is a \u201csignificant moment in our national story\u201d.\nIt is \u201ca reminder that for all the challenges we face as a country, Britain is a place where people of all races and all beliefs can fulfil their dreams\u201d Starmer says. It\u2019s part of what makes us all so proud to be British, he adds.\n\n\n\n 12.05pm  \n\nDr Alan Whitehead (Lab) begins by congratulating Rishi Sunak on his new post and of being the first PM of a South Asian heritage.\nHe asks if Sunak has changed his mind about campaigning to prohibit the development of onshore wind, which he says is the cheapest form of power available to us in the country.\nSunak replies by saying that he \u201csticks by what we said in our manifesto\u201d, adding: \n\nThe important thing is to focus on our long term energy security. That means more renewables, more offshore wind, and indeed more nuclear. That\u2019s what this government wants.\n\n\n\n\n 12.03pm  \n\nRishi Sunak begins his first PMQs with the standard statement about his engagements, that he had meetings with ministerial colleagues in addition to his duties in the House.\n\n\n\n 11.57am  \nSunak to face his first PMQs\n\nRishi Sunak is about to begin his first Commons appearance as prime minister. \n\n\n\n 11.50am  \n\nThe foreign secretary, James Cleverly, defended Rishi Sunak\u2019s decision to appoint Suella Braverman as home secretary after she resigned over security reasons one week ago. \nBraverman handed in her resignation to then prime minister, Liz Truss, after sending a confidential email from her personal email address, breaking ministerial code. \nCleverly said Braverman had \u201cmade a mistake\u201d and Sunak wished to see the home secretary \u2018see through\u2019 her robust plans for policing and immigration.\n\n\n\n\n 11.46am  \nLabour granted urgent question on Braverman appointment\n\nLabour has been granted an urgent question in the Commons later on Wednesday, with the party due to ask the home secretary Suella Braverman to make a statement on her resignation and reappointment.\nThe shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper will ask Braverman \u201cto make a statement on her resignation and reappointment as home secretary\u201d.\nThe Commons will hear the question after PMQ this lunchtime.\n\nUpdated at 11.47am BST\n\n\n 11.44am  \n\nRishi Sunak has been pictured leaving No 10 for the House of Commons to attend his first Prime Minister\u2019s Questions.\n\n\n\n\n\n 11.37am  \n\nThe chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, announcing his decision to delay his fiscal statement, also defended the appointment of Suella Braverman as home secretary a week after she was forced out of the role.\nAsked if he was happy with the reappointment and whether he trusted Braverman, he told reporters:\n\nShe apologised for her mistakes. She\u2019s been fully accountable for those mistakes, she stepped down as home secretary. But from the point of view of people at home, who want stability in the economy, they also need to see a united Conservative party and that\u2019s why the prime minister has put together a cabinet of all the talents.\n\n\n\nUpdated at 11.42am BST\n\n\n 11.34am  \n\nThe new environment secretary, Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Coffey, has said that protecting the environment will be at the heart of her mission in her new role.\nThis may not seem like a significant statement but her predecessor, Ranil Jayawardena, initially claimed his role was mostly about supporting economic growth and cutting red tape for farmers.\nHer statement could signal hope that she is moving away from divisive policies such as scrapping nature-friendly farming incentives, banning solar farms and attacking the RSPB. She has also vowed to work with environment groups to protect nature \u2013 perhaps meaning the tensions between the department and groups including the RSPB and national trust could be soothed.\nShe told the Guardian:\n\nI am delighted to return to Defra, this time as secretary of state.\nAs the prime minister set out, protecting our environment is at heart of our manifesto. I will work closely with rural communities, farmers, industry and the champions of our environment to strengthen our natural environment and support our thriving food and farming sector. I look forward to resuming our work to protect nature and deliver a stronger rural economy.\n\n\n\nUpdated at 11.42am BST\n\n\n 11.29am  \n\nThe chancellor Jeremy Hunt has insisted postponing the fiscal statement was the right move to ensure the \u201cvery, very difficult decisions\u201d required \u201cstand the test of time\u201d.\nHe told reporters:\n\nThe OBR also want to make sure that their forecasts are the most accurate possible and there have been a lot of changes even in the last 48 hours.\nThis is my recommendation to the prime minister as the best way to ensure that the decisions that we take, these very, very difficult decisions, are ones that stand the test of time and give us the best chance of giving people security over the mortgages, over their jobs, over the cost-of-living concerns that everyone has.\n\nHe added that he is willing to make \u201cpolitically embarrassing\u201d choices. He said:\n\nI\u2019ve demonstrated in the short time that I\u2019ve been chancellor that I\u2019m willing to take decisions very quickly and I\u2019m willing to make choices that are politically embarrassing if they\u2019re the right thing to do for the country, if they\u2019re in the national interest.\nNow we have a new prime minister and the prospect of much longer-term stability for the economy and the country. In that context a short two-and-a-half week delay is the best way we will make sure that it is the right decisions we take.\n\n\n\n\n 11.23am  \n\nThe SNP has said Rishi Sunak\u2019s record is a serious cause for concern for households and public service, as the prime minister warned of \u201cdifficult decisions\u201d ahead with major spending cuts expected to be laid out soon.\nSunak\u2019s time in office was already a clear sign of the looming threat facing families, the SNP said, highlighting the former chancellor\u2019s decision to scrap the \u00a320-a-week uplift to Universal Credit which slashed the incomes of 6 million people by \u00a31,040 a year.\nThe SNP\u2019s Westminster deputy leader Kirsten Oswald said:\n\nHis record in office is already a serious cause for concern for what\u2019s on the horizon for struggling families and businesses. From slashing Universal Credit, imposing an extreme Brexit, refusing to deliver meaningful support as the cost of living crisis worsened, and raising taxes on everyone else while his own family avoided them, Rishi Sunak shares the blame for the economic crisis and the hardship facing millions of people across Scotland and the UK.\n\n\n\n\n 11.15am  \n\nThe chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, has confirmed that his fiscal statement has been postponed to 17 November. Previously scheduled for 31 October, the statement will now be a \u201cfull autumn statement\u201d to reflect the \u201cmost accurate possible economic forecasts\u201d.\nHe told reporters:\n\nMy number one priority is economic stability and restoring confidence that the United Kingdom is a country that pays its way.\nFor that reason, the medium-term fiscal plan is extremely important. I want to confirm that it will demonstrate debt falling over the medium term, which is very important for people to understand. It\u2019s also extremely important that that statement is based on the most accurate possible economic forecasts and forecasts of public finances.\nFor that reason, the prime minister and I have decided that it is prudent to make that statement on the 17th of November when it will be upgraded to a full autumn statement.\nI\u2019ve discussed this last night with the governor of the Bank of England. He understands the reasons for doing that, and I\u2019ll continue to work very closely with him.\n\n\nUpdated at 11.27am BST\n\n\n 11.08am  \nFiscal update delayed for autumn statement on 17 November\n\nThe Treasury has announced that the fiscal statement, originally planned for 31 October, has now been delayed until 17 November.\n\n\nUpdated at 11.11am BST\n\n\n 11.01am  \n\nThe environment sector has reacted with some surprise that Rishi Sunak has appointed Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Coffey as environment secretary.\nAt a crucial time for the environment, with much important and complex legislation coming down the line including the farming payments review due this week, many hoped the new prime minister would choose someone with recent senior experience in the department.\n\nNames hopefully floated around as the reshuffle took place included George Eustice, the former secretary of state under Boris Johnson, and Victoria Prentis, a former minister at the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) who is popular in the farming sector. Some even dared to dream that Michael Gove, the architect of a lot of the post-Brexit environmental legislation that was under threat by Liz Truss, might make a return.\nHowever, there are some points of hope in Coffey\u2019s appointment, despite the fact she has not shown much interest in the environment in the past. Unlike her predecessor Ranil Jayawardena, she held a junior ministerial role at Defra for three years.\nRead the full story here:\n\n\nUpdated at 11.09am BST\n\n\n 10.50am  \n\nThe head of the UK\u2019s lobbying watchdog has called for tougher disclosure rules to show which ministers have been solicited, as well as a review of exemptions made use of by David Cameron and Philip Hammond.\nHarry Rich, who is in charge of the register of consultant lobbyists and their clients, said it would \u201csignificantly assist transparency\u201d if lobbyists were asked to reveal which ministers and permanent secretaries they had spoken to \u2013 as well as when, how and what about.\nHe also told the Guardian that it would \u201cdefinitely enhance transparency\u201d if contact between consultant lobbyists and special advisers was brought under the regime. \u201cThe more transparency there is, the more the aims of the legislation are being upheld,\u201d he said.\nRich is making suggestions for more transparent lobbying declarations in a submission to parliament\u2019s public administration and constitutional affairs committee (Pacac) in his first public intervention on the subject since taking the job in 2018.\nIn the submission, he suggests declarations include which minister or permanent secretary was lobbied, dates of the communications, medium of communication \u2013 whether by meeting, letter or email, phone, text \u2013 and topics of communication. \u201cThe fact that the targets of lobbying activity are not identified on the register feels like a significant gap,\u201d it says.\nRead the full story:\n\n\n\n\n 10.44am  \nLabour joins calls for investigation into Suella Braverman\n\nThe shadow home secretary, Yvette Cooper, has written to the cabinet secretary, Simon Case, to demand an investigation into Suella Braverman after she breached the ministerial code.\nBraverman was forced to resign for a security breach for emailing confidential policy to a backbench MP, John Hayes, and trying to copy in his wife but mistakenly emailing it to another MP\u2019s office. Officials raised alarm that Braverman may have been sharing sensitive information outside the department.\nCooper wrote:\n\nIf a full investigation has not yet taken place into the extent of this and other possible security breaches, I am urging you and the Home Office to now urgently undertake such an investigation as the public has a right to know that there are proper secure information procedures in place to cover the person who has been given charge of our national security.\nIt must include the extent of the Home Secretary\u2019s use of private email accounts to circulate Government papers and the extent to which official documents have been sent outside Government, as well as any other concerns that have been raised about possible serious information and security breaches by Suella Braverman.\n\nThe Lib Dems have also called for a Cabinet Office inquiry into Braverman.\n\nUpdated at 10.47am BST\n\n\n 10.38am  \n\nRishi Sunak may delay a fiscal announcement that is pencilled in for Halloween and will be designed to stop the markets going into another spiral, a senior minister has admitted.\nGiven that the new government has only just got up and running, James Cleverly, the foreign secretary, said it may no longer be possible to stick to that date for the statement, when major spending cuts and grim forecasts about the future of the economy are expected to be laid out.\nThe long-awaited statement was originally meant to be the former chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng\u2019s chance to set out his medium-term growth plan, and it was brought forward by nearly a month after borrowing costs and currency exchange markets went haywire off the back of his mini-budget.\nThough Kwarteng was sacked as Liz Truss tried to shore up her dying government, the new chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, promised he would stick to the timetable, viewed as vital to reassure the City that the exchequer could plug a fiscal black hole of about \u00a370bn.\nHowever, Cleverly suggested the date could be pushed back, saying it would not be a bad thing if the government had more time.\nAsked if the government could delay the Halloween statement, he told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme:\n\nIt may well do. The prime minister\u2019s only just stepped in. That date was set by the previous prime minister in the anticipation that she would be able to work throughout this period of time on that with the chancellor. Obviously things have changed.\n\nRead the full story here:\n\n\nUpdated at 10.40am BST\n\n\n 10.31am  \n\nLabour\u2019s shadow education secretary, Bridget Phillipson, said the reappointment of Suella Braverman as home secretary \u201ctells you everything that you need to know about this government\u201d.\nBraverman is back in the role as the result of a \u201cgrubby deal\u201d which helped Rishi Sunak \u201cget over the line\u201d and become prime minister, Phillipson told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme. She said:\n\nOne moment Rishi Sunak is telling us he will lead a government of integrity, and then another minute he\u2019s appointing someone back into the Cabinet who\u2019d been sacked only the week before for a serious breach of security and a potential breach of the ministerial code.\n\n\nUpdated at 10.36am BST\n\n\n 10.23am  \n\nMinisters educated at private schools make up nearly two-thirds of the new cabinet, led by the Winchester alumnus Rishi Sunak as prime minister, according to analysis by the Sutton Trust social mobility charity.\nSome 61% of ministers appointed by Sunak attended private schools, similar to the proportion of Liz Truss\u2019s original cabinet (68%) and Boris Johnson\u2019s first cabinet (64%) but more than twice that of Theresa May\u2019s 2016 cabinet (30%), and above that of David Cameron\u2019s 2015 cabinet (50%). Cabinets led by Labour leaders Tony Blair and Gordon Brown had around a third of ministers who were independently educated.\n\nSunak\u2019s cabinet also sees the three major government departments all led by privately-educated ministers: the Home office, the foreign office and the Treasury.Of the 31 ministers attending Sunak\u2019s new cabinet as of this morning, 45% went to Oxford or Cambridge universities. This compares with 21% of all MPs.As a prime-ministerial Oxford graduate, Sunak continues a line at Number 10 that stretches back to the start of world war two: other than Gordon Brown, every prime minister who attended university was educated at Oxford.\n\n\n\n 10.16am  \n\nMore from the foreign secretary, James Cleverly, who told Times Radio he didn\u2019t know when the fiscal statement would come. He said:\n\nThe prime minister ... will want to spend time with his chancellor working through the plans to make sure that they fit with the priorities that he has set out as prime minister. If he can do that very, very quickly, then we may well be able to get it on that date. I haven\u2019t had confirmation either way.\n\nHe once again defended the reappointment of Suella Braverman just days after being forced to resign from the same post over a serious security breach. Cleverly said:\n\nSuella made an error. She has said she has made an error, she has apologised for that. But also what I know is that she is relentlessly focused on cracking down on crime, securing our borders, making sure that the Home Office is a high functioning department. I suspect that is why the prime minister wants her back around the Cabinet table because those issues are ones that I know of very close to the heart of the people in my constituency and other people across the country.\n\n\nUpdated at 10.27am BST\n\n\n 10.11am  \n\nThe first pictures have arrived showing Rishi Sunak with members of his cabinet at their first meeting in Downing Street. \n\n\n\n\n\n 10.08am  \nLib Dems demand inquiry into Braverman\u2019s return as home secretary\n\nThe Liberal Democrats have called for a Cabinet Office inquiry into Rishi Sunak\u2019s reappointment of Suella Braverman as home secretary six days after she was sacked for a serious security breach.\nThe Lib Dem home affairs spokesperson, Alistair Carmichael, said:\n\nSuella Braverman\u2019s appointment makes a mockery of Rishi Sunak\u2019s claims to be bringing integrity to Number 10. There must be a full independent inquiry by the Cabinet Office into her appointment, including any promises Sunak made to her behind closed doors.\nIf it is confirmed that Suella Braverman repeatedly broke the ministerial code and threatened national security, she must be sacked.\nA home secretary who broke the rules is not fit for a Home Office which keeps the rules.\n\nLabour\u2019s shadow home secretary, Yvette Cooper, yesterday accused Sunak, who had promised to govern with \u201cintegrity\u201d, of \u201cputting party before country\u201d.\n\n\nUpdated at 10.24am BST\n\n\n 10.01am  \n\nMore Cabinet ministers were photographed arriving at Downing Street to attend the first meeting of Rishi Sunak\u2019s cabinet.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 9.58am  \n\nNicola Sturgeon reminded Rishi Sunak of her hopes to stage a fresh Scottish independence referendum and urged significant action on living costs during a brief inaugural phone call with the prime minister on Tuesday night.\n A Scottish government read-out of their conversation said the first minister also asked Sunak to honour his pledge for a more constructive relationship \u201cbuilt on mutual respect\u201d between the government, after a fractious relationship with his predecessor Liz Truss.\nThe statement said:\n\n The first minister also expressed the strong view that the UK government should address the pressure and pain being felt by people and businesses as a result of inflation and other economic pressures, and should not exacerbate that with a further wave of austerity.\n[Finally,] the first minister made clear her intention to honour the mandate the Scottish government received from the people of Scotland at the last election.\u201d\n\n Sturgeon, the Scottish National party leader, noted that the chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, had promised to consult with devolved administrations in advance of his emergency budget next week. \nThe continuing disarray at Westminster has led her finance secretary, John Swinney, to postpone by at least a week publication of Scotland\u2019s draft budget. Swinney expects to cut hundreds of millions of pounds in spending, due to inflation and Hunt\u2019s expected cuts.\nIn amongst a round of calls with foreign leaders on Tuesday, Sunak also called Mark Drakeford, the Labour Welsh first minister. It is something of a convention now for incoming prime ministers to speak to devolved government leaders soon after taking office, a tradition Truss ignored, to Sturgeon\u2019s irritation. \n\n\n\n 9.53am  \n\nMore from the foreign secretary James Cleverly who this morning defended Rishi Sunak\u2019s decision to reappoint Suella Braverman to the role of home secretary.\nBraverman\u2019s return to the Home Office comes just days after she was forced to resign from the same post over a serious security breach. \nCleverly told BBC Breakfast:\n\nSuella made a mistake. She has said herself that she made a mistake. She\u2019s apologised for that mistake and she stood down at the time.\n\nHe denied her return came in exchange for her endorsement of Sunak in the Tory leadership contest when Boris Johnson still threatened a comeback during the leadership race last week. \nHe added that Braverman has \u201cvery very clear ideas\u201d about border control, policing and crime, adding:\n\nShe\u2019s very passionate about that and got a very clear agenda for that. It\u2019s clear that the prime minister wanted to see that delivered.\n\n\n\n\n 9.46am  \n\u2018Not a bad thing\u2019 if fiscal statement delayed, says Cleverly\n\nThe foreign secretary James Cleverly has suggested the fiscal statement planned for 31 October could be delayed as Rishi Sunak wants to ensure it \u201cmatches his priorities\u201d.\nSpeaking on BBC Breakfast, Cleverly said:\n\nObviously the date of that fiscal statement was originally set with no expectation of a change of prime minister. We\u2019ve now had a change of prime minister.\n\nSunak is in the process of forming a government and will want some time with his chancellor Jeremy Hunt \u201cto make sure that the fiscal statement matches his priorities\u201d, he continued. He said:\n\nI don\u2019t know whether that means that date is going to slip... The prime minister and the chancellor know they need to work quickly on this but they also want to get it right, so we\u2019ll see what happens to that date.\n\n\nHe was also unable to confirm whether the government\u2019s financial statement will go ahead on Monday while speaking to Sky News. He said:\n\nWe know it needs to come soon, we know people want certainty, we know people want a clear idea of the government\u2019s plans. Whether it happens exactly on that day, I\u2019m not able to confirm.\n\n\n\n\n 9.38am  \n\nMinisters have been arriving at Downing Street to attend the first meeting of Rishi Sunak\u2019s cabinet.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated at 9.38am BST\n\n\n 9.30am  \nJeremy Hunt may delay Halloween fiscal statement\n\nRishi Sunak is considering a delay to next week\u2019s highly anticipated fiscal statement intended for 31 October, according to a report.\nThe Times has reported that the prime minister is expected to meet the chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, today to discuss his proposals to increase taxes and squeeze public spending that are due to be unveiled to MPs and markets on Monday.\nSunak is considering postponing the update until next month to allow more time to scrutinise the options, the paper writes.\nThe statement could be pushed back and turned into a full budget to set out the new government\u2019s priorities for all areas of tax and spending, it adds.\nA government source said that while Sunak was across the \u201cbroad thrust\u201d of Hunt\u2019s plans, he wanted to \u201cget under the bonnet\u201d of the options. They said:\n\nThe prime minister and chancellor will be looking at the timing of the statement in the near future.\n\n\nUpdated at 9.39am BST\n\n\n 9.16am  \nWhat the papers said after prime minister\u2019s reshuffle\n\nRishi Sunak\u2019s sudden return to the top of British politics and the unveiling of his new cabinet dominates the UK front pages on Wednesday.\nThe Guardian headlines \u201cPM\u2019s reshuffle gamble on first day in charge\u201d and leads with an image of Rishi Sunak meeting King Charles at Buckingham Palace on Tuesday.\nThe paper writes that Sunak \u201cpledged to bring \u2018integrity and accountability\u2019\u201d but \u201cgambled by restoring Suella Braverman to the Home Office less than a week after she was sacked for a security breach.\u201d\n\nRead the full story here:\n\n\n\n\n 9.14am  \nRishi Sunak to hold first cabinet meeting ahead of first PMQs\n\nGood morning. Rishi Sunak will meet with his new cabinet this morning and face his first Commons appearance as prime minister, as he begins the gruelling task of uniting his party and restoring the country\u2019s economic credibility.\nAs he entered No 10 yesterday as PM, the fifth in six years, Sunak vowed to fix the \u201cmistakes\u201d of his predecessor Liz Truss and pledged to bring \u201cintegrity and accountability\u201d into his government. His cabinet reshuffle was billed as returning experienced hands to the top jobs, but Sunak gambled by restoring Suella Braverman to the Home Office less than week after she was forced to resign for a security breach.\nSunak\u2019s new cabinet keeps Jeremy Hunt as chancellor and attempts bridge the divide with former Boris Johnson supporters by sticking with the foreign secretary, James Cleverly, and the defence secretary, Ben Wallace.\nDominic Raab, Sunak\u2019s own key ally who described Truss\u2019s economics as a suicide note, becomes his deputy prime minister and justice secretary.\n\nHowever, Sunak made several decisions that alarmed some MPs, as he reappointed Braverman as home secretary and declined to promote his former rival Penny Mordaunt. He also appointed David TC Davies as Welsh secretary despite his controversial comments on subjects including face veils, trans rights, child refugees, climate change and same-sex marriage.\nBraverman, who still harbours her own leadership ambitions, was handed the job six days after she was forced to resign for a security breach for emailing confidential policy to a backbench MP, John Hayes, and trying to copy in his wife but mistakenly emailing it to another MP\u2019s office. Officials raised alarm that Braverman may have been sharing sensitive information outside the department.\nThe return of Braverman, a Eurosceptic rightwinger, drew a shocked reaction from some MPs on the moderate wing of the party \u2013 but is widely seen as a \u201cpayback\u201d for her endorsement of Sunak when Johnson still threatened a comeback during the leadership race last week.\nHere is the agenda for the day.\n09.30am. Sunak will hold his first cabinet meeting.\n09.45am. Home affairs committee on Channel crossings, which is due to hear from David Neal, the independent chief inspector of borders and immigration.\n12pm. PMQs\n2.15pm. Treasury committee hearing on the Autumn 2022 fiscal events.\nMy name is L\u00e9onie Chao-Fong and I\u2019ll be taking you through today\u2019s developments in British politics for the next few hours. Feel free to drop me a message if you have anything to flag, you can reach me on Twitter or via email.\n\nUpdated at 9.18am BST\n"

                    "body": "Lionel Messi celebrated his return to domestic competition after the World Cup by scoring a second-half goal as Paris Saint-Germain extended their Ligue 1 lead to six points with a 2-0 home win against Angers. Messi, who wore a T-shirt honouring Pel\u00e9 when he warmed up, received a strong welcome from the Parc des Princes crowd. He netted from close range in the 72nd minute to add to Hugo Ekitike\u2019s first-half opener, putting PSG on 47 points from 18 games.  Lens stayed second but dropped two points in a 2-2 draw at struggling Strasbourg with all the goals being scored before the break. Third-placed Marseille are now two points adrift of Lens on 39 points after a 2-0 win over Troyes. Ross Barkley scored twice as Nice responded to Lucien Favre\u2019s sacking with a 6-1 thrashing of Montpellier. Arsenal loanee Nicolas P\u00e9p\u00e9 also hit a double. Thibaut Courtois saved Jos\u00e9 Gay\u00e0\u2019s poorly struck spot-kick to give Real Madrid a 4-3 penalty-shootout win over Valencia in their Spanish Super Cup semi-final in Saudi Arabia.  The two teams finished level at 1-1 after 90 minutes and extra time. Karim Benzema gave Real Madrid, the holders, the lead from the spot in the first half after he was fouled inside the area by Eray Comert but Valencia came back into the game and deservedly equalised through a Samuel Lino volley from a Toni Lato cross straight after half-time. Vin\u00edcius J\u00fanior could have won it for Real Madrid in extra time but his close-range shot was saved by Giorgi Mamardashvili. Real Madrid will face the winner of Thursday\u2019s semi-final between Real Betis and Barcelona in the final in Riyadh on Sunday. In Italy, Milan crashed out of the Coppa Italia after a 1-0 home defeat to Torino. Koffi Djidji was shown a red card in the 70th minute but Ndary Adopo struck in extra time for the 10 men."

                    "body": "Dejan Kulusevski is reflecting on his latest life adventure and there is certainly a richness to the back story. A ballsy and controversial move from his native Sweden to Italy before he was 16. Experience in Serie A with Atalanta, Parma and Juventus. An explosive start to his career at Tottenham, where he went in January. A billing as the great hope of the Sweden team, who he hopes to drive to the World Cup finals over the next week and a half. It is hard to believe that Kulusevski is only 21 as he speaks with an easy confidence in English \u2013 one of the four languages in which he is fluent. The others are Swedish, Italian and Macedonian; his family\u2019s roots are in North Macedonia. Kulusevski can understand some German and he is starting to do likewise with Spanish. But there is something else for him now.  Kulusevski can call himself a reality TV star. Maybe that is pushing it a bit. Kulusevski sees Playmakers \u2013 which is made by TV4 in Sweden \u2013 as \u201csomething very small \u2026 it\u2019s not even on television, it\u2019s on an app on the internet\u201d. The show, which entered its fifth series on Thursday, follows women who are together with sporting personalities and lead glamorous lives. But if Kulusevski\u2019s girlfriend, Eldina Ahmic, who has played football at a good level, is one of the principal subjects, it is not as if he is not in it, too. \u201cThey follow her life more,\u201d Kulusevski says, explaining that Eldina shoots the footage on her own phone. \u201cThere\u2019s no cameras. We\u2019d have never done it with cameras. I\u2019m just there maybe acting a little bit funny, sometimes.\u201d Kulusevski mentions a Carpool Karaoke-type scene. \u201cIt was me and my girl singing together in the car, like everybody does \u2026 we love music.\u201d But it is when he is asked whether they were nervous about opening their private lives to the public that his character shines through. \u201cShe was nervous, absolutely,\u201d Kulusevski says. \u201cMe less. Because I know for some years that everything I do comes out in a way or another. Yeah, you have to be very careful with what you show to people because they cannot wait to bring you down. But I am maturing a lot and the more the time goes, the more comfortable I feel in who I am. So here I am. I don\u2019t care what will happen and what I say. I just love being myself.\u201d  Kulusevski came to feel stifled at Juventus. After Max Allegri replaced Andrea Pirlo as the manager last summer, he found that his playing time decreased. \u201cIt was hard,\u201d Kulusevski says. \u201cYou really have to be strong when things are not going the way you think they should be going and there are things you can\u2019t control. It\u2019s very frustrating when you love something and you cannot show it. I knew I needed a change.\u201d Kulusevski looks reborn at Spurs and it is a mark of the impact he has made since his move on an initial 18-month loan from Juventus that the supporters already have a chant for him. \u201cGimme, gimme, gimme a ginger from Sweden,\u201d they sing to the Abba classic. Kulusevski is heavily into his hip-hop so Abba? Really? \u201cThey\u2019re quite good \u2026 I can\u2019t say anything bad about them,\u201d he says, laughing. \u201cI love the chant. All my friends send it to me all the time and think it\u2019s really funny.\u201d  Kulusevski has been energised by the trust that the Spurs manager, Antonio Conte, has placed in him. He gave a powerhouse performance in his first start \u2013 the 3-2 Premier League win at Manchester City, in which he scored one and set up another \u2013 and he has kept his place for the six games that have followed. Conte has used him as the right-sided No 10 in his 3-4-2-1 system and he will count on him again in Sunday\u2019s home derby with West Ham. \u201cIt\u2019s especially the coach and the staff who are helping me a lot, letting me make mistakes and be me, letting me play without pressure,\u201d Kulusevski says. \u201cWhen you are good in your mind, you usually play good football. \u201cAbout my best position, it\u2019s hard to say because football is evolving and I am a guy who cannot stand still and I want to move in big, big spaces. The coach has helped me a lot because I really find my space right now. I like where I\u2019m playing and every game I have had chances to score.\u201d Kulusevski\u2019s football journey was fired when he left his first club, Brommapojkarna or BP \u2013 in the west of Stockholm \u2013 for Atalanta. Considered a prodigy, BP did not want him to go and their director, Ola Danhard, infamously said it was \u201calmost kidnapping\u201d by Atalanta. Kulusevski and his family did not see it that way. They wanted the move, no matter the challenges it would present. \u201cI went when I was 15-and-a-half, without parents \u2026 going to school in a language that I did not understand,\u201d Kulusevski says. \u201cI did a lot of hard things but it helped me a lot. I learned so many new things.\u201d  These days, Kulusevski can learn from one of his heroes \u2013 Zlatan Ibrahimovic, who came out of retirement for Sweden last March. The 40-year-old is in the squad for the World Cup play-offs; Sweden face the Czech Republic on Thursday and, if they win, they will play Poland on Tuesday week for a place at the finals.  Kulusevski talks reverentially about Ibrahimovic, who was born in Sweden to a Bosnian father and Croatian mother. Kulusevski was also born in Sweden, as was his father, Stefan, although his parents were from North Macedonia. Kulusevski\u2019s mother, Katica, was born and raised in North Macedonia, moving to Sweden as an adult. \u201cZlatan opened doors to us people in Sweden that nobody can imagine,\u201d Kulusevski says. \u201cHe really helped every young kid \u2026 kids who were outsiders, showing them that everything is possible. When he started mentioning my name as a player, I was like a kid at Christmas. \u201cFor me and my family, Macedonia is very important. Like my mum says, we will never forget where we come from. I go there every summer and I love it. I\u2019ve always said that if I could play for Sweden and Macedonia I would. But I had to choose and I chose Sweden because I am from there. Now we have the West Ham game and, after that, I will be ready to bring my country to the World Cup. It\u2019s where we belong.\u201d "

                    "body": "Country Grammer provided Frankie Dettori with a fourth success in the Dubai World Cup at Meydan.\nThe winning horse over the dirt was trained by Bob Baffert, who himself collected a fourth World Cup success despite controversy back home in the United States, where he is fighting a series of legal battles over Medina Spirit\u2019s positive post-race test for banned substances when winning last year\u2019s Kentucky Derby.\n\nBaffert has recently lost four Kentucky Derby hopefuls after owners moved them to new trainers to allow them to run in this year\u2019s race on 7 May. The trainer of 2018 Triple Crown winner Justify is banned from his horses competing at Churchill Downs, where the Derby is held.\nHe received that two-year ban last June but is still allowed to compete elsewhere and duly collected another World Cup to follow training the winners of the 1998, 2001 and 2017 winners on Silver Charm, Captain Steve and Arrogate respectively. Medina Spirit himself died of a heart attack while training in Santa Anita last December.\nDettori won his first Dubai showpiece event aboard the great Dubai Millennium in 2000 and on Moon Ballad in 2003 and Electrocutionist in 2006. Having earlier finished in a dead heat with Japanese runner Panthalassa for the Dubai Turf, the Italian\u2019s mount was part of a formidable American World Cup contingent headed by red-hot favourite Life Is Good.\nTodd Pletcher\u2019s Breeders\u2019 Cup Dirt Mile winner had successfully stepped up to nine furlongs in the Pegasus World Cup in January. He got off to his usual fast start and led the field into the home turn, but it was obvious with a furlong to run that the petrol tank was emptying quickly and he faded into fourth.\n\nDettori meanwhile delivered Country Grammer and was well on top at the line, with Hot Rod Charlie staying on strongly to finish second with Japan\u2019s Chuwa Wizard in third.\n\u201cHe\u2019s a big horse and did exactly what I wanted him to do until the half-mile pole when I thought Life Is Good was getting away from me,\u201d said Dettori. \u201cI started trying something different to get him on the right leg, give him some fresh air and fill his lungs. Passing the furlong marker I thought \u2018I\u2019ve won this\u2019. The last furlong was amazing \u2013 such a great feeling.\n\n\u201cLife Is Good is one of the best, but if there was a chink in his armour it was the mile and a quarter. This is an important race, and Dubai has taken up a good chunk of my life. Coming back it was as if I\u2019m part of the furniture.\u201d\nJohan takes the Lincoln for Channon and De Sousa\nJohan made a successful debut for the Mick Channon team with an impressive display in the SBK Lincoln at Doncaster. A six-time winner for William Haggas, the five-year-old switched yards during the off-season and was a 28-1 shot for the traditional Flat season curtain-raiser in the hands of Silvestre de Sousa.\nAlways to to the fore, Johan quickened up to take over the lead from Saleymm deep inside the final furlong and passed the post with a length and a quarter in hand. Saleymm was a clear second, with Rogue Bear making late gains to beat Irish Admiral to third."

                    "body": "It is more than 33 years ago since Neneh Cherry swaggered around the Top of the Pops stage in big white trainers performing Buffalo Stance with the fierce energy of a woman who was having a fine old time and wanted everyone to know about it. Around her neck hung a huge medallion and she wore a golden bustier and matching jacket. But it wasn\u2019t her outfit that was the talking point at secondary school the next day \u2013 but the seven-month pregnancy bump that stuck proudly out of her Lycra miniskirt as she lip-synched along. It was the first time many of us had seen a pregnant woman being, well, visible and certainly the only time we\u2019d seen one looking so sensationally cool. Allegedly, a journalist was daft enough to check with Cherry that it was safe for her to go on stage in her state of pregnancy, to which she sighed: \u201cIt\u2019s not an illness.\u201d  It was footage of the Pakistan captain, Bismah Maroof, holding her six-month-old daughter Fatima at the Women\u2019s World Cup in New Zealand that instantly brought back memories of that Thursday night watching Cherry. Although Maroof was dressed in her pine-green Pakistan tracksuit and had her hair pulled back in a sportswoman\u2019s ponytail, she radiated the same power to inspire change. Seeing female cricketers with their children is not unknown, and there are eight mothers playing in the current World Cup \u2013 Maroof, New Zealand\u2019s Amy Satterthwaite and her wife, Lea Tahuhu, West Indies\u2019 Afy Fletcher, Australia\u2019s Megan Schutt and Rachael Haynes, and Lizelle Lee and Masabata Klaas of South Africa \u2013 but it is practically unheard of on the subcontinent, where marriage and/or childbirth is usually the end for a cricketing career. A fantastic article by Annesha Ghosh in The Cricket Monthly, looking at motherhood and cricket, summarises that only three of the 81 female cricketers contracted by India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh are married. Maroof, then, is an outlier, not only leading her country but showing that motherhood does not have to spell the end to sporting ambition.  Maroof tells Ghosh that even during her own career, some of her teammates have had to give up the game: \u201cBatool [Fatima], Nain [Abidi], Asmavia [Iqbal], Qanita [Jalil] and several others \u2013 they were all Pakistan teammates of mine who either couldn\u2019t resume cricket for a long time after marriage or had to leave it altogether for good.\u201d However, the increased professionalism of the game over the past few years, and Maroof\u2019s own pregnancy, nudged the Pakistan Cricket Board, during Wasim Khan\u2019s spell as chief executive, into a maternity leave policy. This gives women a year\u2019s paid leave (and men a month) plus shared costs of a support person to help with childcare \u2013 in this case Maroof\u2019s mother, who has been seen cuddling Fatima in the stands.  The standout photos of Maroof and her baby came after the World Cup game between India and Pakistan on Sunday, won by India (therefore cementing their 100% record against Pakistan in one-day internationals). In them, members of the Indian team surround Maroof who is holding Fatima, cooing over the altogether cuteness of the baby in her red headband, playing peek-a-boo and trying to get her to look at the camera. The sheer delight shared between the two teams is not something that is usually demonstrated between the Pakistan and Indian men\u2019s teams, whose matches in international tournaments are often hijacked by politicians and fans and turned into some kind of ridiculous proxy war, often ending in violence, either in the stands or on the streets. The lower profile of the women\u2019s matches, and the friendship between the players, has led to a far happier conclusion. \u201cComing back post-pregnancy in six months and playing international cricket is so inspiring,\u201d wrote Smriti Mandhana on Instagram. \u201cBismah Maroof setting an example for sportswomen across the globe. Lots of love to baby Fatima from India and I hope she picks the bat just like you because lefties are special.\u201d Despite the disparity in achievement between the two teams \u2013 India are ranked four and Pakistan eight \u2013 it is actually Pakistan who have taken the lead in franchise cricket, with Ramiz Raja, the Pakistan Cricket Board\u2019s player-chairman, announcing a women\u2019s branch of the Pakistan Super League to be played next year. Meanwhile the BCCI continues to stonewall on the possibility of a women\u2019s Indian Premier League, with the secretary, Jay Shah, saying it would happen \u201csoon\u201d, despite the obvious talent pool of female cricketers and a ready supply of foreign players desperate to be part of the story.  But, in the hours after International Women\u2019s Day, our thoughts should rest most with cricket-loving girls in Afghanistan, where the future of the women\u2019s cricket team is still unclear, and most teenage girls have now gone 173 days without returning to school after the Taliban took over. In November, the Afghanistan Cricket Board\u2019s chair, Mirwais Ashraf, said: \u201cWomen\u2019s cricket is one of the major requirements of the ICC. Therefore it is committed to obtaining it.\u201d However, most of Afghanistan women\u2019s team are believed to have fled the country and on the ACB website there are no photographs of any female players, no details of any upcoming women\u2019s fixtures. In fact, no details on women\u2019s cricket at all. \u2022 This is an extract from the Guardian\u2019s weekly cricket email, The Spin.

                    "body": "If England are to return from Australia victorious this summer then it is almost an understatement to say the fledgling partnership between Marcus Smith and Owen Farrell needs to develop into a formidable double act. It is a truism that England will rely on their forward muscle, their kicking prowess and their set-piece grunt against the wily Wallabies but despite the importance of those parts of the game, so much rides on whether Smith and Farrell hit it off on the pitch. They have managed only 68 minutes at 10-12 for England so far together, as it turns out, against Australia in the autumn - a comprehensive victory for Eddie Jones\u2019s side and a qualified success for the Smith-Farrell axis. The idea is that Farrell can step in at first receiver during structured play while Smith lurks, scanning for space and waiting for the opportunity with that little bit more time. Sounds simple enough on paper but lest we forget they did not have Samu Kerevi lining them up back in November and it is a surefire bet they will see plenty of the Australia centre in the coming weeks.  Without Manu Tuilagi at outside centre, the importance of the two men inside whoever wears the No 13 jersey is heightened and though Jones will keep his cards close to his chest over selection - to the extent he has not publicly named his tour captain - he has been candid over his plans for Smith and Farrell, who have been wasting little opportunity to get themselves on the same page. \u201cHe\u2019s a brilliant player,\u201d said Smith of Farrell. \u201cHe\u2019s a massive competitor and wears his heart on his sleeve. More than that he\u2019s got brilliant vision and skills at the line. Hopefully we can put our competitive edge together to try and get a Test series win. We\u2019ve spoken long and hard about it. I think we complement each other nicely. I think we both see the game pretty similarly. I hope we can both come together and get the best out of each other. Hopefully I can be there to get the best out of him and allow him to show his skills on the park. Hopefully he can also allow me to show the best of me.\u201d  Outwardly, they are markedly different personalities but Smith and Farrell share an obsession with all things rugby which ensures they have plenty to talk about and when the England squad descends en masse to the second game of rugby league\u2019s State of Origin series on Sunday in the same stadium that stages next Saturday\u2019s first Test, there will be few spectators watching the match more intently. \u201cI love watching Super Rugby and the NRL,\u201d adds Smith. \u201cI actually can\u2019t get enough. It\u2019s brilliant to bounce ideas off him and George [Ford] when he\u2019s in camp as well. It\u2019s nice to learn from these guys because they\u2019ve got so much experience. Hopefully we can continue to do that with the Origin games which are going on at the same time. We chat here and there and if we see something in any game, we talk and chew the fat a little bit. We\u2019ll try and bring it together if we get to play together. Through the season we definitely share ideas. We try to talk when we can.\u201d Smith has proved an avid learner. He works closely with Jonny Wilkinson whenever the World Cup winner drops into England camps, he remains in close contact with Finn Russell following the British &amp; Irish Lions tour last summer, he took himself off to train with Leeds Rhinos and he has been picking the brains of Quade Cooper, the Australia fly-half who he may well line up against in Perth next weekend.  \u201cWe\u2019ve connected a little bit over socials and he\u2019s helped me a lot actually,\u201d says Smith. \u201cHe\u2019s taught me a few things he\u2019s done. This time I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll be talking too much on the tour but hopefully post-game we can have a beer and hopefully I\u2019ll be the one smiling. \u201cJust different ways to see the game. The types of things he looks for when he\u2019s analysing opposition. The way he thinks when he makes a mistake. It\u2019s his mindset, really. It\u2019s pretty amazing to chat to those guys and just pick up one thing from them because they\u2019ve been playing international rugby for a long time now.\u201d This will be Smith\u2019s first tour with England. He needs no history lesson over the significance of Anglo-Australian rivalries, however. \u201c[It] is obviously huge, not just in rugby but in cricket and all other sports. My dad instilled in me as a young kid that there is a lot of rivalry and confrontation in those games. It\u2019s one of those rivalries you want to be a part of.\u201d"

                    "body": "Hekmatullah, the rogue Afghan soldier who killed three unarmed Australian diggers in Afghanistan a decade ago, is living in a luxury home in the capital Kabul, treated as a \u201creturning hero\u201d by the Taliban who released him from prison.\nHe has said he does not regret killing Australian soldiers, and has vowed he would again kill Australians, or anyone who opposes the Taliban.\n\u201cIf I am released I will continue killing foreigners,\u201d Hekmatullah told an official of the former Afghan government when his release was being negotiated.\n\u201cI will continue killing Australians and I will kill you as well because you are a puppet of foreigners,\u201d he said.\n\u201cI am among my brothers, we will be free, Afghanistan will be free. We will kill you.\u201d\nSince returning to Afghanistan, Hekmatullah has reportedly been housed in the former diplomatic quarter of Wazir Akbar Khan. He lives in a heavily secured property in a district adjacent to the clandestine former home of Ayman al-Zawahiri, the former al-Qaida leader assassinated eight days ago by a US drone strike as he stood on the balcony of his villa.\n\nHekmatullah\u2019s release from prison in 2020 was fiercely resisted by Australia, with the government previously conceding it did not know where he had been since being freed.\nOf 5,000 prisoners the Taliban wanted released as part of peace deal negotiations with the US, Hekmatullah was one of six terrorists that western governments fiercely resisted being pardoned, because they had either killed unarmed foreign nationals, were unrepentant about their crimes, or had vowed to commit further acts of violent terrorism.\nA former senior official in the democratically elected government of Afghanistan \u2013 overthrown in August 2021 \u2013 has confirmed to the Guardian Hekmatullah\u2019s return to Afghanistan.\n\u201cHe was welcomed back to Kabul as a hero \u2026 with a house, car, guards, an amnesty for his crimes, his expenses are being paid for. He is being treated as a hero.\u201d\nThe Guardian has independently confirmed Hekmatullah\u2019s repatriation to Afghanistan. Family members of the Australian soldiers killed have said they have not been updated on his whereabouts.\nOn 29 August 2012, at Wahab, a patrol base in Afghanistan\u2019s Uruzgan province, Hekmatullah, then an Afghan National Army sergeant, drew his M16 and fired more than 30 rounds from close range at Australian troops. He killed three: L/Cpl Stjepan Milosevic, 40, Spr James Martin, 21, and Pte Robert Poate, 23.\nHekmatullah fled the base into the Baluchi valley and was designated a \u201chigh-value\u201d target for the Australian SAS in Afghanistan within 24 hours. He was the sole target of a controversial SAS mission to the village of Darwan in Uruzgan province on 11 September 2012, based on \u2013 ultimately flawed \u2013 intelligence he was hiding in the village.\nThe mission was the subject of extensive evidence presented during the long-running defamation trial brought by the former SAS corporal Ben Roberts-Smith, who denies all wrongdoing in relation to an allegation he participated in the murder of an Afghan national during that mission.\nTwo other Australian SAS soldiers have also been accused of unlawfully killing Afghan nationals during the raid \u2013 allegations they deny.\nIt was not until February 2013 that Hekmatullah was arrested after being found hiding in Pakistan\u2019s lawless border region. Charged, tried and convicted of three counts of murder, Hekmatullah was sentenced to death, but served only seven years in Bagram prison before being moved to Qatar in 2020, where he lived under house arrest.\nAfter the fall of Kabul to the Taliban, he returned to Afghanistan, where he now lives in Kabul.\nThe senior former government source said he insisted to senior government officials that Hekmatullah not be released, because he presented an ongoing danger, but objections to his release were overruled because of a US desire to conclude its 2020 peace agreement with the Taliban.\n\u201cThe person I met is a dangerous terrorist, a dangerous man,\u201d the source said. \u201cHe is not repentant, not regretful. He is a threat, he can cause harm to the world. He should not have been released.\u201d\nThe source said Hekmatullah appeared to be \u201cvery well protected\u201d, with close links to senior Taliban officials now in government.\n\u201cBut the Taliban who hold the strongest grudges, who want to take revenge, are those who were in prison, including him, Hekmatullah. He has hatred still.\u201d\nThe release of the 5,000 Taliban prisoners was the subject of fierce and fractious debate during negotiations between the US and representatives of the terror networks in Qatar.\nThe US-led Coalition objected to 200 of the prisoners because of the nature of their crimes \u2013 green-on-blue attacks, or attacking civilian targets \u2013 or because they were seen to be ongoing terror threats. Hekmatullah was among the 200.\nAfter further negotiations, the list of objections was reduced to 15: Hekmatullah was still on the list. After still more talks, the list of objections was just six names. Hekmatullah remained still, deemed unsuitable for release.\nIn August 2020, then prime minister Scott Morrison said he spoke directly with then US president Donald Trump, urging that Hekmatullah remain imprisoned.\nHekmatullah, Morrison said, was \u201cresponsible for murdering three Australians and our position is that he should never be released\u201d.\nBut the US overruled Australia\u2019s objections, arguing the release of terrorist prisoners, while unpopular, would lead to a \u201creduction of violence and direct talks resulting in a peace agreement and an end to the war\u201d in Afghanistan.\nAustralia\u2019s department of foreign affairs and trade declined to answer questions on Hekmatullah.\nThe anonymous previous-government source told the Guardian former officials who remain in Afghanistan face the grave threat of retribution from the Taliban.\n\u201cThe Taliban is seeking revenge: they have no mercy. We will be identified soon. Our lives, and the lives of our families, are in danger.\u201d\nHe said the US assassination of al-Zawahiri, the former al-Qaeda leader, had escalated tensions \u2013 and heightened Taliban security fears \u2013 dramatically.\n\n\u201cThe world is definitely putting pressure on the Taliban for appearances. But no matter how much pressure is put on the Taliban, they put pressure on the people.\u201d Those who worked for the former democratically elected government have \u201cbeen left on the battlefield \u2026 as enemies of the Taliban\u201d, he said.\nA Human Rights Watch report this month said Taliban forces had summarily executed or forcibly disappeared more than 100 former police and intelligence officers in four provinces since taking over the country in August 2021, in defiance of a proclaimed amnesty.\n\u201cSummary killings and enforced disappearances have taken place despite the Taliban\u2019s announced amnesty for former government civilian and military officials, and reassurances from the Taliban leadership that they would hold their forces accountable for violations of the amnesty order,\u201d the report said.\n\u201cThe Taliban, through their intelligence operations and access to employment records that the former government left behind, have identified new targets for arrest and execution.\u201d"

                    "body": "\u2018Happy Thursday everyone!\u201d the official Uefa Europa League account tweeted on the morning of 24 February, looking ahead to another crucial round of matches in Europe\u2019s second most prestigious men\u2019s football competition. Alas, not everyone was in quite as festive a mood. For, just a few hours earlier, Russian artillery had moved into Ukraine bringing up the curtain on a bloody and avoidable war in mainland Europe. It\u2019s easy to forget it now, amid the breathtaking speed with which the world of sport has closed ranks against Russia, but in the hours and days after the fighting started Uefa on Twitter was hardly the only sports authority to monumentally fail to read the room. For example, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) eventually banned Russia from the Paralympic Winter Games but only after first announcing an unsatisfactory compromise in which Russian athletes would have been allowed to compete in neutral colours. Fifa only kicked the Russians out of this year\u2019s World Cup qualifying after other European teams made it clear they were not prepared to play them. This is, after all, how Big Sport has instinctively operated: cautiously, conservatively, with a moral cowardice that runs as deep as its avarice. With empty gestures and weasel words. Only when the scale of global outrage became apparent, only when it became obvious that any entity associated with Russia was at risk of suffering grievous, perhaps terminal reputational damage, did many governing bodies take decisive action. \u201cThere go my people,\u201d the French revolutionary Alexandre Ledru-Rollin is said to have remarked. \u201cI must find out where they are going so I can lead them.\u201d This is not a particularly new phenomenon. In 1939, the IOC was looking for a new venue for the 1940 Winter Olympics after Japan\u2019s military aggression meant it had to relinquish hosting rights (voluntarily, rather than after any significant pressure). Hitler\u2019s invasion of Poland soon forced the IOC to cancel the Games entirely, having first reassigned them to the charming ski resort of Garmisch-Partenkirchen in Nazi Germany. However, even in this digital age, it is possible to feel vaguely stunned at the speed with which the landscape of sport has now changed. The men\u2019s Champions League final has been stripped from St Petersburg and handed to Paris. Manchester United have ended their commercial partnership with Aeroflot. Russian teams \u2013 and in some cases individual athletes \u2013 have been banned across sport, from athletics to cycling, rugby union to Formula One. It is inconceivable that Russia will be allowed to host any major sporting event for many years.  Most shocking of all, individuals whose wealth and power were widely assumed to be impregnable have been forced from the stage. Roman Abramovich has announced his intention to sell Chelsea FC, sensing the threat of sanctions in the UK. The Russian billionaire Alisher Usmanov has stepped down as president of the International Fencing Federation and his sponsorship of Everton FC has been suspended. Even Vladimir Putin has been punished, with the International Judo Federation stripping him of the honorary presidency he has held since 2008. Other cases are more complex. Was it right for Russian F1 driver Nikita Mazepin to be ejected from the British Grand Prix then see his Haas team contract terminated? Should individual Russian athletes be punished unless they condemn the invasion of Ukraine? Will Ivan Drago have to be censored out of the Rocky movies? In part, this is the tragedy of autocracy: the state and the individual begin to bleed into each other to the extent that it is difficult to separate them. Whether you are a billionaire oligarch, a film-maker reliant on state funding or an athlete benefiting from a centralised performance programme, it is virtually impossible to thrive in Russia without becoming entangled with the regime in some form. But the wider lesson here is one that goes well beyond Russia and well beyond this war. For years, we have been told by the world\u2019s sporting bodies, many of its athletes and the majority of its autocratic regimes that sport can and should be kept separate from politics. Now we realise why they were so intent on touting and maintaining this fiction. For those invested in the smooth running of international sport, either as a vehicle for commercial growth, personal enrichment or soft power, politics means questions and moral dilemmas. It means independent thought, scrutiny and oversight. It means exercising a conscience. It means change. Now, as it turns out, an entire country can be wiped from the sporting map almost overnight if the will is there to do it. And for political reasons, rather than anything it has done on the field of play. This was possible all along! Why, then, was Russia allowed to host the 2018 Fifa World Cup? Why was the genocidal regime in China rewarded with this year\u2019s Winter Olympics? Why have abusive governments in the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia been allowed to own football clubs and cycling teams? Why is this year\u2019s World Cup in Qatar? The past week has been an eye-opener in many ways. Athletes leading the call to action. Public opinion forcing governing bodies into U-turns. People beginning to rethink the entire relationship between elite sport, money and power. Maybe this is just a fleeting illusion of solidarity in the jaws of a terrible human catastrophe. But if things really are going to change, this is how it starts. \u2022 Jonathan Liew is a Guardian sports writer"

                    "body": "  8.21pm    Thanks for reading this MBM. Nighty night!      8.21pm    Jurgen Klopp\u2019s turn to chat with Sky Sports. \u201cA massive result \u2026 a clean sheet \u2026 two wonderful goals \u2026 space for improvement as well, obviously \u2026 the red card would have been a wonderful goal as well \u2026 against ten men we didn\u2019t react particularly well, we lost our momentum and it was difficult to get back \u2026 Newcastle had nothing to lose any more, a top team with top character \u2026 they threw everything on the pitch \u2026 and we gave them too many set pieces and with set pieces it\u2019s not important how many men you have on the pitch \u2026 if we had scored the third, it would have been it, but we didn\u2019t, and so it was exciting to the end \u2026 the most negative thing is that Darwin has to go off, he has something with his shoulder \u2026 it\u2019s the first clean sheet away from home since April [splutters a laugh] and I can\u2019t believe that \u2026 you need results \u2026 in the end I am really happy we got it over the line, because so many things have happened to us this season \u2026 this time nothing happened, we were not perfect but we were good to win \u2026 we take the result and go from here \u2026 Real Madrid on Tuesday is a tough test but it\u2019s Anfield and I can\u2019t wait!\u201d     8.09pm    Eddie Howe, bravely keeping his chin up, talks to Sky. \u201cA lot happened in the game \u2026 a good start, we created the first chance \u2026 Alisson made a couple of good saves \u2026 then we conceded two goals which is unlike us \u2026 I\u2019m disappointed with them, I\u2019d need to look back on them \u2026 I really feel for Nick Pope, he slightly misjudged the ball \u2026 I suppose technically it is a handball, I don\u2019t know the rules of the red card, it felt like a harsh decision, the player was at an angle with defenders retreating towards our goal, but that was given \u2026 the reaction from the team was brilliant \u2026 we were still in the game, we were competitive, we had chances \u2026 if we could get the third goal we had a route back into the game, but that never came \u2026 we showed with ten against 11 how good we can be \u2026 we were comfortable in our shape and had some threat in transition \u2026 had that goal came the result could have been different \u2026 I back the players to come out of it [their current goalscoring troubles], we have too much quality not to \u2026 both [Loris Karius and Mark Gillespie] have started games away from competitive action, so they\u2019re both match ready \u2026 I have full confidence in both \u2026 we showed that we can be competitive in a different way and overall I am positive going into the cup final \u2026 we need to go into next week with the mindset of protecting our goal, regardless of who is in goal \u2026 we have to look forward to what will be an exciting week for us \u2026 attack the game and try to win.\u201d     7.50pm    The verdict from the managers will be coming soon \u2026 but in the meantime, Louise Taylor\u2019s match report has landed. Here it is!      7.49pm    Allan Saint-Maximin speaks to Sky. \u201cIt is a very bad day \u2026 I feel sad for Nick Pope, because he tried to help the team \u2026 he did everything to help us to be [in the final] so we have to support him \u2026 for sure it\u2019s a bad day \u2026 we played very well, we had the first chance \u2026 after that they scored so it was painful but we kept playing to create more chances \u2026 and then we had that red card \u2026 with ten men we still played very well \u2026 even if Liverpool are not in a top position at the moment, they are still a great team, so to play well with ten men against that team is very good \u2026 I am very disappointed \u2026 we need to think about the final \u2026 I know all the team will fight to be able to win that important game \u2026 the real positive is that even with ten men down against a very big team who play in the Champions League, we play very well \u2026 we created many chances to come back into the game \u2026 I know many teams would not create the chances we created \u2026 so this is positive before we play Manchester United \u2026 I am sure we can cause a lot of problems to Manchester United.\u201d     7.42pm    Trent Alexander-Arnold speaks to Sky \u2026 \u201cThis is a massive one for us \u2026 this was a big one \u2026 we got our win against Everton, which was also massive, but would have meant nothing if we hadn\u2019t backed it up here with another win \u2026 Newcastle are a tough side to beat, but we picked them apart \u2026 the red card settled the game down \u2026 not many teams come here and win so we\u2019re delighted \u2026 they haven\u2019t conceded a lot of goals, so to break them down twice is something not a lot of teams do \u2026 we haven\u2019t had much confidence to be honest, some good performances but no consistent period \u2026 we\u2019re used to going on winning streaks, so we know how to put them together \u2026 it\u2019s starting to feel and look like Liverpool, so there are positive signs \u2026 it\u2019s a great stepping stone for us.\u201d \u2026 and so does Virgil van Dijk. \u201cWe have had results already this season when we\u2019ve felt now is the time to kick on, but this is a little bit different \u2026 coming away from the big win against Everton it was important to keep going \u2026 the red card changed the game a bit for them but also us \u2026 we could have done better, but there is a reason we are the only team to have beaten them \u2026 I am very proud of the boys \u2026 when you play against ten men sloppiness creeps in, you have to try to do the same things, but it is difficult \u2026 we can be proud \u2026 now is time to make the rest of the season as good as possible \u2026 we want to find consistency \u2026 we have to gain confidence in order to gain momentum.\u201d     7.33pm    Jurgen Klopp congratulates his team more in relief than anything else. They\u2019re still not quite firing on all cylinders, yet scored two fine goals in the first 17 minutes, the game effectively won when Nick Pope then received his marching orders on 22. They never quite managed to put the game to bed, though, and a spirited Newcastle kept them working until the very end of an evening that could have major consequences: Liverpool travel home with their top-four hopes boosted, while Pope\u2019s red card throws Newcastle\u2019s League Cup final plans into turmoil. Eddie Howe, in contrast to Klopp, cuts a pensive figure.      7.24pm   FULL TIME: Newcastle United 0-2 Liverpool  Newcastle battled well to limit the damage, all of which was done in the first 22 minutes.     7.23pm    90 min +2: On Sky, Jamie Carragher names Allan Saint-Maximin as his man of the match. The Newcastle forward has indeed been superb in adversity. Before the game, he said he\u2019d \u201ctry to do the best game that is possible\u201d in memory of his old friend Christian Atsu. He\u2019s done that and more.     7.22pm    90 min +1: The first of three added minutes sees Jota round Dubravka on the left but take it a little too wide. He can\u2019t slot from a tight angle, and Salah isn\u2019t able to get on the end of the loose ball. Jota could quite feasibly have scored a four-minute hat-trick there.     7.20pm    90 min: Elliott rolls a pass wide right for Alexander-Arnold, who crosses deep. Jota comes in at the far stick and guides a sensational, delicate header across Dubravka and inches wide of the top-right corner. That would have been a fine goal, from the ridiculous to the sublime. But it\u2019s not to be. Firmino attempts to high-kick home from a very tight angle on the right but can\u2019t connect. Goal kick.     7.19pm    88 min: Liverpool play it short. Elliott then hits long for Van Dijk, who heads back towards Jota in the middle. One from the training ground. Burn heads behind for a corner on the right. From which Jota misses disgracefully, heading a Robertson cross wide left while unmarked, six yards out. He\u2019s been out injured for some time, he\u2019s allowed to be a little rusty.     7.17pm    87 min: Jota\u2019s persistence earns Liverpool a corner down the left. Robertson to take.     7.16pm    86 min: Alisson strides out of his box to deny Saint-Maximin possession. He has indeed been marvellous this evening.     7.14pm    84 min: Saint-Maximin attempts to launch a counter but is denied by a fine last-ditch lunge by Milner, who nicks the ball off his toe. Saint-Maximin stays down, which is another worry for Newcastle ahead of next weekend, but thankfully springs back up again soon enough.     7.13pm    82 min: Firmino plays a loose pass in the centre circle to a dozing Milner. Gordon romps off with the ball. He slips Wilson into the box down the left. Wilson aims for the bottom right, allowing Alisson to kick away. His third huge save of the game. On Sky, Jamie Carragher suggests that, despite it all, Alisson has been Liverpool\u2019s best player. It\u2019s a difficult point to argue with.     7.11pm    81 min: Newcastle clear with ease. Liverpool come again, but Robertson slips as he makes his way down the left. No matter, because Gordon gifts them the ball back. Salah is in space on the edge of the D. He sidefoots lamely straight at Dubravka. A comedy of errors.     7.10pm    80 min: Salah tears down the right and looks for Alexander-Arnold in the middle, but his low cross is turned out for a corner by Ritchie. Alexander-Arnold to take.     7.09pm    79 min: On the touchline, Jurgen Klopp cuts an agitated figure. His team just can\u2019t put this game to bed.     7.08pm    77 min: Ritchie whips in from the left. Van Dijk eyebrows away from danger with Wilson lurking dangerously. Newcastle have been playing with ten men for nearly an hour, but they haven\u2019t once threatened to capitulate. It\u2019s not exactly been ideal, yet in its own way its been very impressive. It all augurs well for days when they\u2019re not behind the eight-ball.     7.06pm    75 min: Robertson, Firmino, Jota and Elliot combine smoothly down the left flank. With a man over in attack, a series of simple passes gets them all the way to the Newcastle box. Robertson has the opportunity to shoot from the penalty spot, but unselfishly lays off to Salah, who is eased off the ball by Botman. That should have been a nerve-settling third for Liverpool. But they overplayed their hand, and Newcastle still have hope.     7.04pm    73 min: Eddie Howe might be planning for next weekend\u2019s final, but his ten men are still scrapping away on the pitch. Liverpool aren\u2019t being given a moment\u2019s peace.     7.01pm    71 min: Joelinton jabbers at Eddie Howe, desperate to stay on and play. But Howe\u2019s not having it. He tells his assistant to \u201cdo it\u201d and up goes the board. As Joelinton is replaced by Ritchie, Howe makes a point of telling the disappointed player that he\u2019s doing it \u201cfor you\u201d. To be fair to Joelinton, there was no tantrum involved; he just wanted to keep going.     7.00pm    69 min: Joelinton goes down with cramp. Looks like he\u2019ll be hooked with next week\u2019s big final in mind. He doesn\u2019t want to leave, though, and wags his finger in the direction of the Toon dugout.     6.59pm    67 min: Gomez channels his inner Beckenbauer, striding down the middle before attempting to release \u2026 Robertson?! \u2026 who is clearly playing out some Gerd Muller fantasies. Robertson-Muller attempts to flick towards the nearby Jota, but the backheel doesn\u2019t come off. All very heady.     6.56pm    66 min: Newcastle aren\u2019t going away, and Longstaff makes his way down the right. He\u2019s skittled by Milner, who is fairly fortunate not to go into the book. Nothing comes of the resulting free kick.     6.55pm    64 min: Wilson, Gordon and Murphy replace Isak, Almiron and Trippier. The former Evertonian Gordon receives a warm reception from his own fans, and the sort of pantomime welcome you\u2019d expect from the away end.     6.53pm    63 min: Robertson is getting plenty of joy down the left. He romps down that flank again. This time his low cross is snaffled by Dubravka. But Newcastle suddenly can\u2019t get out, and Liverpool come again, Jota making ground on the left before flashing a shot-cum-cross through the six-yard box. Nobody in red was taking a gamble. It\u2019d have been an easy tap-in.     6.51pm    61 min: Robertson swings a cross into the Newcastle box from the left. Dubravka should claim, but flaps. Newcastle clear their lines regardless, and Saint-Maximin counters down the inside-left channel before thrashing a wild shot wide and high.     6.50pm    60 min: Liverpool make a quadruple substitution. Gakpo, Nunez, Bajcetic and Henderson make way for Jota, Firmino, Milner and Elliott. Nothing comes of the corner.     6.48pm    58 min: Before the corner can be taken, Nunez goes down holding his shoulder again. A worry for Liverpool ahead of the Champions League tie against Real Madrid next week.     6.47pm    57 min: \u2026 so having said that, Nunez hares down the left, cuts infield, and sends a power curler towards the bottom right. Dubravka sticks out an arm to deny him and turn around the post for a corner.     6.45pm    55 min: Nunez is back up again quickly enough. When play restarts, Alisson and Van Dijk confuse each other as a long ball is played down the Newcastle left. Van Dijk heads behind for a needless corner, from which Schar heads harmlessly wide left. Ten-man Newcastle look most likely to score the next goal.     6.44pm    54 min: Nunez comes off second best in a battle with Trippier down the Liverpool left. Not only will it be a goal kick for Newcastle, Nunez has hurt his shoulder in falling as well. On comes the trainer.   Updated at 6.53pm GMT    6.43pm    53 min: Saint-Maximin hassles Robertson and Van Dijk down the right. He fizzes a low cross into the Liverpool box for Isak, who spins on the penalty spot and aims for the top left. Just over. Had that been on target, I\u2019m not sure Alisson was getting to it. That was too easy for Newcastle, who are still very much in this game, despite it all.     6.41pm    51 min: Liverpool probe hither and yon, attempting to make the pitch as big as possible. But Newcastle hold their shape well. No cracks emerge.     6.40pm    50 min: Saint-Maximin brings the fight to Liverpool down the middle. He enjoys a tussle with Bajcetic and nearly bursts through into space. Not quite, but both players will be proud of their contribution in that no-quarter-given duel.     6.38pm    48 min: Alexander-Arnold makes a nuisance of himself down the right. Joelinton wrestles the ball off him only to blast his clearance straight into Longstaff\u2019s surprised grid. Play stops as Longstaff gathers himself.     6.36pm    46 min: Newcastle know they need the next goal, and come out of the traps flying. Isak nearly benefits from Henderson\u2019s pondering on the edge of his own box. Liverpool eventually clear their lines but that\u2019ll give the hosts succour.     6.35pm    Newcastle get the second half underway. There have been no half-time changes.     6.24pm    Half-time reading.      6.20pm   HALF TIME: Newcastle United 0-2 Liverpool  Liverpool are two goals up. Newcastle are one man down. But the hosts have responded gamely to the early triple whammy they suffered, and aren\u2019t quite out of this yet.     6.18pm    45 min +2: Gomez wedges a fine pass down the inside-right channel for Salah. Had Salah extended a leg, he may have been able to guide the ball past the out-rushing Dubravka. But he opts to attempt to bring it down and round the keeper, and his touch is no good. Goal kick.     6.16pm    45 min: There will be four minutes added to this eventful first half.     6.14pm    43 min: Alexander-Arnold crosses from the right. It\u2019s deflected behind for a corner on the left. Robertson takes. Burn wins another header, but this time it\u2019s a clearing one.     6.13pm    42 min: Newcastle have responded really well to an awful sequence of events. They\u2019ve been the better side since going down to ten men.     6.12pm    41 min: Newcastle probe awhile, then suddenly spring forward through Longstaff, who drives in from the right. He earns a corner off Van Dijk. It\u2019s sent into the mixer. Burn rises highest and crashes a header off the crossbar!     6.10pm    39 min: Salah shapes to send the free kick towards the top left but gets it all wrong.     6.10pm    38 min: \u2026 although that was unfortunate for Newcastle, because Nunez was a yard offside as he combined with Salah. But the flag didn\u2019t go up, and now it\u2019s a free kick, the incident can\u2019t be reviewed. Had it been a penalty, play would have almost certainly been pulled back in Newcastle\u2019s favour.     6.09pm    37 min: One corner leads to another, then Liverpool break upfield again. Salah and Nunez combine down the middle, the former racing towards the right-hand edge of the D. Almiron is forced to take one for the team and foul him. He\u2019s booked.     6.08pm    36 min: Nunez takes a long ball down on the edge of the Newcastle D and is clipped by Schar, but the referee waves play on. Newcastle counter, and Nunez is in the thick of it again, forced to chest out for a corner as Trippier and Longstaff probe.     6.05pm    34 min: Once again, Liverpool calm things down with some measured passing across the back.     6.04pm    32 min: Nothing comes of the corner, but Henderson, formerly of Sunderland and to the amusement of the home crowd, makes a pig\u2019s lug of a simple clearance and the Toon force a repeat corner. Nothing comes of that, either, but that little burst of action proves that Newcastle, for all that they\u2019re up against it, aren\u2019t out of it quite yet.     6.03pm    31 min: Saint-Maximin chases a long pass down the right. He twists Robertson\u2019s blood, before whipping a shot towards the top left. Alisson is required to extend at full length to tip over the bar. His second big save of the game!     6.00pm    29 min: Liverpool stroke it around the back awhile as everyone gathers their thoughts. They\u2019re probably as discombobulated as Newcastle. This sort of thing doesn\u2019t happen every week.     5.59pm    27 min: Incidentally, Dubravka might be Newcastle\u2019s go-to stand-in today, but he won\u2019t be able to deputise for Pope next week at Wembley, having turned out in the League Cup for Manchester United while on loan earlier in the season. Loris Karius to star in his first major showpiece since the 2018 Champions League final?     5.56pm    25 min: Dubravka comes on for the sacrificed Anderson, and immediately makes a big stop, as Alexander-Arnold\u2019s free kick is met by Gakpo, who fires a header straight at the stand-in keeper.     5.55pm    23 min: Pope suffered a proper rush of blood there. The referee had no option. Off he goes \u2013 and what a costly mistake it is, because that means he\u2019ll miss the League Cup final against Manchester United next weekend!     5.54pm   RED CARD! Pope (Newcastle United)  22 min: Alisson claims and instantly launches long. Salah scampers after the long pass from the halfway line! Pope races from his area and stoops to head out of Salah\u2019s path \u2026 only to fall over, then stick an instinctive arm out to smother. The referee flashes red. He\u2019s off!   Updated at 6.05pm GMT    5.52pm    21 min: Anderson cuts in from the left flank and is flipped into the air by Fabinho. It\u2019s another poor challenge by the out-of-sorts Liverpool midfielder, and into the book he goes. Trippier takes the resulting free kick and \u2026     5.50pm    19 min: There\u2019s another check for VAR, this time for offside. But Gakpo was a few inches on. What a pass that was from Salah. What a spin by Bajcetic to start the whole thing off.     5.49pm   GOAL! Newcastle United 0-2 Liverpool (Gakpo 17)  Bajcetic spins gracefully away from Longstaff in midfield and sets Liverpool away on the attack. Fabinho rolls to Salah, 30 yards out, just to the right of centre. Salah chips a pass down a big gap in the middle of the Newcastle defence. Gakpo takes a touch and slots into the bottom right. Another goal that seemed to arrive out of nowhere, in an instant.   Updated at 5.55pm GMT    5.47pm    15 min: Alexander-Arnold looks in the mood, and fires a low diagonal ball into the Newcastle box from the right. Trippier is forced to poke out for a corner with Gakpo lurking. The set piece comes to nothing. Meanwhile here indeed is our old pal Jeff Sax of the Darwin Nunez Appreciation Society, who would like to correct my copy. \u201cThat was not \u2018simple\u2019 for Nunez. First in the last 12 games. A miracle!\u201d He\u2019s not going to let it like, readers, is he.     5.44pm    13 min: That\u2019s taken a bit of air out of the stadium. Newcastle had been the better team in the early exchanges, and that kind of came out of nowhere. \u201cJeff Sax in three, two, one\u2026\u201d chants Joe Pearson.     5.43pm    11 min: There\u2019s a quick VAR check. Did the ball roll down, or brush, Nunez\u2019s arm as he chested down? Nope. He took it down gracefully. That was one heck of a finish. He drove that into the bottom left at 101 mph!   Updated at 5.48pm GMT    5.42pm   GOAL! Newcastle United 0-1 Liverpool (Nunez 10)  Alexander-Arnold picks up possession to the right of the centre circle. He rakes a pass down the middle, where Nunez chests down before slamming past Pope and nearly ripping the net from its moorings. Simple as that. What a finish!   Updated at 5.46pm GMT    5.40pm    9 min: Liverpool take a little of the early sting out of the game with some passing around the back, and then \u2026     5.39pm    7 min: Nunez probes down the left. He cuts back in the direction of Salah but the ball doesn\u2019t get through and Anderson intercepts. Both teams look in the mood to attack; it may well be the best form of defence for the visitors, who have lost their last three Premier League matches on the road.     5.36pm    5 min: Newcastle have started strongly and Saint-Maximin bursts his way past Alexander-Arnold down the left. He shoots from a tight angle. Van Dijk heads the ball back to him. Saint-Maximin shanks a snapshot out for a goal kick. Liverpool do not look secure at the back.     5.35pm    4 min: Saint-Maximin barrels down the left and cuts infield. He finds Almiron in an absurd amount of space just to the right of the D. Almiron is one on one with Alisson. He tries to force the ball past Alisson but the keeper sticks out a strong arm to parry and claim.   Updated at 5.40pm GMT    5.34pm    3 min: Trippier rolls a clever pass down the inside-right channel and nearly releases Isak. Van Dijk snoozing a bit. He\u2019s fortunate that Alisson has read the danger and races off his line to smother.     5.33pm    1 min: Saint-Maximin and Isak combine down the left. The latter crosses. Robertson extends a leg to clear. The ball bounds down the Liverpool left and Nunez hares after it. He\u2019d be free, as well, had Pope not raced miles out of his box to blooter clear. A fast start that promises much.     5.31pm    Everyone takes the knee \u2013 there\u2019s no room for racism \u2013 and then Liverpool get the ball rolling. \u201cWhen Atsu was with Newcastle and he came on as a sub, I recall reacting to the announcement of his name with, \u2018Bless you!\u2019,\u201d writes Peter Oh. \u201cNow, for different reasons, I say \u2018Godspeed and bless you Christian\u2019, and the same to his family and friends, in their time of grief.\u201d     5.30pm    A warm ovation and moment of solemn reflection in memory of poor Christian Atsu. The away fans sing You\u2019ll Never Walk Alone. A small crumb of comfort that his very last act on a football field was beautiful.       5.27pm    The teams are out! Newcastle in their famous black and white stripes, Liverpool in their storied red. A sensational \u2013 and indeed emotional \u2013 atmosphere at St James\u2019 Park. We\u2019ll be off in a couple of minutes.     5.24pm    A reminder of what happened when these teams met at Anfield early in the season. It remains Newcastle\u2019s last league defeat, indeed their only one of the campaign so far.      5.22pm    Jurgen Klopp speaks to Sky. \u201cThey say we are in a fight for a potential Champions League place but I\u2019m just not there yet that I can announce it, we have to show consistency \u2026 we cannot just win one game and everything is good again \u2026 Newcastle is in that spot and if we can decrease the distance that is always helpful and that is what we will try today.\u201d     5.21pm    In addition to Atsu\u2019s passing, it\u2019s also the 90th anniversary of the birth of the legendary Sir Bobby Robson, and Eddie Howe tells Sky: \u201cIt will be an emotional game \u2026 the crowd will certainly show that before the game in different ways \u2026 for the players it\u2019s a case of concentrating on the performance \u2026 they can\u2019t get swept up in that emotion \u2026 I hope we can be the best version of ourselves that we can be \u2026 we have to use any emotion from the crowd in a positive way.\u201d     5.15pm    This morning\u2019s news of the death of former Newcastle player Christian Atsu has hit hard. Sky Sports have spoken to some of the folk who worked with, knew and loved him. Rafael Benitez, who managed him at Newcastle: \u201cI am really sad \u2026 they said he was fine but it was not true \u2026 he was a nice, nice, special person \u2026 a good professional, a very good professional \u2026 but I don\u2019t talk about if he\u2019s a good player or not, he was a nice lad, a good player, but especially a really nice person, a special person \u2026 you can see the pictures always with a smile \u2026 it\u2019s really sad for him and everyone involved because it is really tragic news \u2026 I was in contact with him last month, we were sharing messages \u2026 it is very bad for me to express in English but I was trying to contact him \u2026 also I don\u2019t want to forget the rest of the people, it is a really difficult time \u2026 but we have to remember Christian.\u201d Eddie Howe, who took him on loan at Bournemouth: \u201cIt\u2019s a real tragedy \u2026 I woke up to the news and was truly devastated \u2026 a lot of players in our dressing room worked with him for a couple of years \u2026 we\u2019ll play tribute to him with a minute\u2019s silence and our thoughts are with him \u2026 we give him our thoughts and prayers to his family.\u201d Allan Saint-Maximin, who played with him at Newcastle: \u201cIt\u2019s a very sad day for Newcastle and most of the players because all of the players know him well \u2026 he was a great guy \u2026 I would have a conversation with him and a very nice time with him \u2026 to see this is very painful \u2026 it is difficult to talk about but I will never forget him and will fight for him \u2026 I\u2019m not going to lie, I will tell you the truth, I never seen a guy like that before, when I just arrived in Newcastle, even if we played the same position, he was always giving me some advice, always a very very nice guy \u2026 he was always talking and smiling even when he didn\u2019t play \u2026 he was always a great person \u2026 it\u2019s a difficult day for me but will try to do the best game that is possible.\u201d      4.39pm    Newcastle make one change to the team sent out for the 1-1 draw at Bournemouth this time last week. Elliott Anderson replaces the injured Joe Willock in midfield. Callum Wilson is back after a hamstring injury, starting on the bench. Liverpool also make just the one change after the 2-0 win over Everton on Monday night. Virgil van Dijk returns from his hamstring injury and takes the place of Joel Matip at the back.     4.32pm   The teams  Newcastle United: Pope, Trippier, Schar, Botman, Burn, Longstaff, Joelinton, Anderson, Almiron, Saint-Maximin, Isak.Subs: Dubravka, Dummett, Lascelles, Gorson, Wilson, Ritchie, Lewis, Manquillo, Murphy. Liverpool: Alisson, Alexander-Arnold, Gomez, Van Dijk, Robertson, Fabinho, Bajcetic, Henderson, Nunez, Salah, Gakpo.Subs: Kelleher, Milner, Keita, Firmino, Elliott, Jota, Tsimikas, Matip, Phillips.    Updated at 4.36pm GMT    4.30pm   Preamble  This is a difficult one to call. Newcastle United are making a serious bid for a place in next season\u2019s Champions League; Liverpool have been broadly awful this season. Newcastle haven\u2019t been beaten in the Premier League since August; Liverpool have already been comprehensively defeated three times in the league since the turn of the calendar year. Newcastle are fourth; Liverpool are nine points adrift of them in ninth. Ah but. Newcastle have been struggling to find the net recently, with just three goals in their last six Premier League games; Liverpool rediscovered their attacking verve against Everton last Monday. Newcastle haven\u2019t beaten Liverpool in 12 Premier League games since 2015; Jurgen Klopp\u2019s side are unbeaten in five league games at St James\u2019 Park. Newcastle are without their suspended talisman Bruno Guimaraes; Liverpool were the last side to defeat them in the Premier League. So you can make a case for both teams. That\u2019s why we love football, huh. Kick off is at 5.30pm GMT. It\u2019s on!  "

                    "body": "Manchester City are considering signing Paul Pogba on a free transfer when the Frenchman\u2019s deal expires at rivals Manchester United in the summer. The Guardian understands Pogba is open to crossing the city. Pogba is interested in working with the Manchester City head coach, Pep Guardiola, who believes the World Cup-winner could operate in a deeper role in midfield. It would be a controversial move, following in the footsteps of Carlos Tevez by leaving United for City, and would mean Pogba accepting lower wages than he is currently on.  City cannot make an official approach to Pogba until the end of the season, but the Guardian understands they are willing to offer the Frenchman a four-year contract, with the option of a further year. Academy graduate Pogba, 29, will not extend his contract at Old Trafford with the club he rejoined from Juventus for \u00a389m in 2016. The midfielder has struggled to make the desired impact at Manchester United, scoring 29 times in 154 league appearances across six seasons during which he has won one League Cup and Europa League. The club offered him a new deal last summer, which was rejected, and they have not been back with another. Pogba shared an agent, prior to Mino Raiola\u2019s death, with Erling Haaland who, the Guardian understands, will join City from Borussia Dortmund in the summer. City will pay the striker\u2019s release clause and terms have been agreed with the Norwegian, whose father Alf-Inge had a spell with City at the start of the century. City are set to lose one central midfielder this summer with the veteran Brazilian Fernandinho announcing he will leave to return to Brazil to carry on his playing career, leaving the squad light in that position. It is rare a player of Pogba\u2019s pedigree and commercial value comes on the market for nothing. Few would be able to afford Pogba\u2019s wages \u2013 he is currently earning a reported \u00a3290,000 a week at Old Trafford \u2013 so he could be left with few options in the summer. Paris Saint-Germain are thought to be interested, while Real Madrid have tried to sign him in the past. Pogba is likely to have played his last game for United after limping off during their defeat against Liverpool earlier this month with a calf injury."

                    "body": "Few players from the lower reaches of English football ever make it into the national consciousness, let alone stay there for decades. Yet Ronnie Radford, who never played at any level higher than the old Fourth Division, did just that. Radford, who has died aged 79, earned his enduring fame on a muddy pitch at non-league Hereford United in February 1972 during a televised third round FA Cup replay match against First Division Newcastle. The tie seemed to be all over when the visitors went 1-0 up with 10 minutes to play. But shortly afterwards Radford won a sturdy tackle just inside the opposition half, played a long-range one-two with the winger Brian Owen and then unleashed a wondrous shot from 30 yards that rocketed into the top corner of the Newcastle goal. As Radford arced across the sodden surface with arms aloft, hundreds of youthful Hereford pitch invaders engulfed him in a scene of such delirious ecstasy that it has become as much a part of the folklore of the FA Cup as the white horse at Wembley or long-haired Charlie George lying on his back after scoring the winner in the 1971 final.  Radford\u2019s glorious strike allowed Hereford to essay one of the greatest ever cup giant-killing feats with a 2-1 win that was sealed by a goal from Ricky George in extra time. Highlights of the drama were relayed to millions on Match of the Day, with suitably excitable commentary from a young John Motson. Radford\u2019s goal has since been replayed hundreds of thousands of times by misty-eyed admirers. The player himself, a journeyman who spent most of his career in part-time non-league football while working as a joiner, was among those playback enthusiasts who could relive the moment endlessly without becoming bored. But he was typically modest about what has often been described as the best ever goal in the FA Cup. \u201cAt the time I didn\u2019t even think about the distance to the goal,\u201d he recalled. \u201cI just thought: \u2018I\u2019ve got to hit this.\u2019 It could have gone in the car park, but it didn\u2019t.\u201d  Radford was born in South Elmsall, a small coal mining town in Yorkshire. He played at school as a midfielder, a position he occupied for most of his career, although he also appeared at full back. Signed up by First Division Sheffield Wednesday in 1961 as a teenager, he was moved on in the same year to Second Division Leeds, where he trained under their player-manager Don Revie. Having failed to make the first team either at Leeds or Wednesday, in 1962 he was signed up by non-league Cheltenham, where he had a happy time for the next three years on a weekly wage of \u00a312 that was supplemented by joinery work. There was a short interlude with Rugby Town in 1965, but he soon returned to Cheltenham, spending another three seasons there and clocking up 318 appearances until Fourth Division Newport County signed him for \u00a31,500, giving him his first experience of higher-level football. \u201cIt was quicker in the Football League, but my fitness levels improved with full-time training and it was a good experience,\u201d he said later. However, Radford was still living in Cheltenham with his wife Annie, found the travelling to Wales onerous, and also missed his work as a joiner, which he regarded as his main activity. After two seasons at Newport, during which he appeared 68 times, he plumped in 1971 for a transfer to part-time Hereford, allowing him to be nearer home and to pick up with his joinery again. \u201cI left Newport because of the travelling really, and I was earning less in full-time football than I was playing part-time and working,\u201d he said. Although he could never have imagined it, the switch to Hereford also quickly thrust Radford into the spotlight. He was barely into his sojourn there when the club went on a terrific FA Cup run, progressing all the way from the qualifying rounds to within theoretical breathing distance of the final at Wembley. Although the momentous win against Newcastle came as a result of a fine team performance, inevitably Radford\u2019s extraordinary goal \u2013 and the heartwarming scenes that followed it \u2013 stole the limelight.  At the time he had never seen himself on the small screen. \u201cAfter the match, me and Annie stopped off for fish and chips and ate it in front of Match of the Day,\u201d he said. \u201cWe thought it was going to be two minutes of highlights but they made it into the main game. I\u2019d never watched myself play football, I didn\u2019t even know what it looked like when I ran. It was such a strange experience.\u201d Although he was flattered to be the centre of attention, Radford was also discomfited by being the focus of so much media activity. \u201cI was only one part of it, one kick. There were 14 other guys who shared all those experiences with the people of Hereford. I just felt so uncomfortable about being singled out.\u201d After the win against Newcastle, Hereford lost in the fourth round of the cup to West Ham, but were subsequently promoted to the football league. Radford stayed at the club until 1974, after which he had a short spell as player-manager at Worcester City and then played for Bath City, where an achilles tendon injury ended his career at the age of 33. A finish to serious football prompted a return to his native Yorkshire, where he settled in Wakefield with Annie and their two children, Gary and David. Taking up joinery full-tme, he remained there for the rest of his life. Each year, as a reminder of his enduring place in public folk memory, Radford was invited to the FA Cup final to present an award to the team that had pulled off the most inspiring giant-killing act in that year\u2019s competition. He is survived by Annie and their sons.  \u2022 Ronald Radford, footballer, born 12 July 1943; died 2 November 2022"

The first is the President\u2019s Award, which will go to a former player or manager whose achievements on and/or off the pitch have helped to develop the match. Uefa president Aleksander Ceferin comes on to wax lyrical about winner Arrigo Sacchi. \u201cHe was visionary in my opinion,\u201d Ceferin says of the erstwhile Milan and Italy coach, who won the European Cup with the Rossoneri in 1989 and 1990. \u201cHis teams attacked home and away, he was never afraid. Great respect, he deserves the award.\u201d Sacchi takes to the stage and is presented with his gong. Luis Figo, sitting in the audience, takes a few snaps with his phone. You\u2019ve got plenty of time to make a cup of tea.     5.05pm    Hosts Pedro Pinto and Reshmin Chowdhury have taken to the stage in Istanbul. Two minutes in, and they\u2019ve already cued up the first montage. While that spools across the continent, here are the clubs most likely to win this year\u2019s Champions League, according to bookmaker aggregation site Oddschecker: Manchester City are favourites, followed by PSG, Liverpool, Bayern Munich, Real Madrid, Barcelona, Chelsea, Tottenham Hotspur, Internazionale, Atletico Madrid, Juventus, AC Milan and Borussia Dortmund.

Previous finalists hoping to go one better at last: Atletico Madrid, Eintracht Frankfurt, Brugge, Bayer Leverkusen, Tottenham Hotspur, PSG, Manchester City.  Updated at 6.32pm BST    4.45pm    More on that television pairing thing. We might as well, we\u2019ve got time to kill. To make sure certain clubs from the same country don\u2019t clutter up the TV schedule on the same day, Uefa have made 11 pairings. All eight groups are distinguished by colour \u2013 A to D red, E to H blue \u2013 and when a paired club is drawn in, say, one of the red groups, the computer will make sure the other paired club is assigned blue. Head hurts. The pairings are as follows:  Real Madrid and Barcelona Eintracht Frankfurt and RB Leipzig Manchester City and Liverpool AC Milan and Napoli Bayern Munich and Borussia Dortmund PSG and Marseille Porto and Benfica Chelsea and Tottenham Hotspur Juventus and Internazionale Atletico Madrid and Sevilla Rangers and Celtic      4.35pm    Today\u2019s Fiver has been contemplating the upcoming draw, and is brought to you in English, Serbian and Hebrew.

This year\u2019s group stage is being squeezed into a nine-week window, as opposed to the usual three months. The things we do for Qatar. The first matchday is on Tuesday 6 September, the final one on Wednesday 2 November. Here are the dates for your diary \u2026  Matchday 1: September 6 and 7 Matchday 2: September 13 and 14 Matchday 3: October 4 and 5 Matchday 4: October 11 and 12 Matchday 5: October 25 and 26 Matchday 6: November 1 and 2  \u2026 then after everyone\u2019s run themselves into the ground at the World Cup, the competition resumes later than normal. Here\u2019s how the rest of it pans out:  Round of 16: February 14 and 15; March 7 and 8 Round of 16: February 21 and 22; March 14 and 15 Quarter finals: April 11 and 12; April 18 and 19 Semi-finals: May 9 and 10; May 16 and 17  Then the final on Saturday 10 June 2023, at the Ataturk Olympic Stadium in Istanbul. As a great man once wondered after pondering the mechanics of an unnecessarily complicated draw: who\u2019s that gonna be?     4.15pm   Preamble  The draw for the group stage of the 2022-23 Champions League takes place at the Ataturk stadium in Istanbul this evening. The seeded pots look like this \u2026  Pot 1: Real Madrid, Eintracht Frankfurt, Manchester City, AC Milan, Bayern Munich, Paris Saint Germain, Porto, Ajax Pot 2: Liverpool, Chelsea, Barcelona, Juventus, Atletico Madrid, Sevilla, RB Leipzig, Tottenham Pot 3: Borussia Dortmund, Salzburg, Shakhtar Donetsk, Internazionale, Napoli, Benfica, Sporting Lisbon, Bayer Leverkusen Pot 4: Rangers, Marseille, Copenhagen, Bruges, Celtic, Viktoria Plzen, Maccabi Haifa, Dinamo Zagreb  \u2026 and the usual rules apply. Teams from Pot 1 will be drawn into Groups A to H, then teams from the next three Pots in turn are plucked from the bowls of destiny. When a team from Pots 2, 3 and 4 are picked, a computer immediately dumps them into the first available group, taking restrictions into account. Those being: two teams from the same country can\u2019t face each other, while certain pairings from the same country must play on different nights for TV purposes. Don\u2019t ask, life\u2019s too short, that\u2019s why the computer\u2019s going to deal with it. The draw is scheduled to begin at 7pm in Istanbul, which is 5pm BST. It won\u2019t, of course, there will be a spirit-sapping amount of pomp, pish, faff and filler before anyone deigns to get down to business. But as soon as those damn balls are plucked, pulled apart, the paper within them unspooled, the names on the paper read out, and the teams assigned to groups, you\u2019ll be the first to know. It\u2019s on!  "

                    "body": "Farhad Moshiri has claimed he retains faith in the under-pressure Frank Lampard and the under-fire Everton board despite the team\u2019s descent into the relegation zone. The Everton hierarchy had been silent on Lampard\u2019s position after the calamitous 4-1 home defeat by Brighton last Tuesday but, responding to a letter from the Everton Fans\u2019 Forum, the owner offered the manager some support and insisted the club needed stability. Moshiri also rejected growing calls from a wide range of Everton supporter groups to replace the chairman, Bill Kenwright, and other members of the club\u2019s board.  \u201cI have faith in the work being done not only by our manager, but our director of football [Kevin Thelwell] and our board of directors,\u201d Moshiri wrote to the Fans\u2019 Forum. \u201cThat faith is based on my knowledge of the depth and quality of work being done both at Finch Farm [Everton\u2019s training complex] and the Royal Liver Building [Everton\u2019s administrative HQ) \u2013 and of the plan that is in place. I am confident that we have skilled, experienced and focused professionals at all levels of the club. We are all agreed that our current league position must and will improve.\u201d Lampard said last week that he did not want or need a vote of confidence from the Everton hierarchy, although the manager accepts he is in a precarious position following a run of nine defeats in 12 games. Moshiri has previous form for publicly backing a manager shortly before sacking them and has dismissed five during a turbulent seven years in charge. Everton host bottom-of-the-table Southampton on Saturday in what appears a critical game for Lampard and his team\u2019s latest relegation struggle. Everton\u2019s last match at Goodison Park, the loss to Brighton, saw chants of \u201csack the board\u201d echo around the stadium. There were similar protests during the FA Cup defeat at Manchester United on Friday and a sit-in demonstration is being organised for after Saturday\u2019s game by the #AllTogetherNow campaign.  The campaign, comprising numerous fan and social media groups plus 21 official supporter clubs, is calling on Moshiri to \u201cmake sweeping changes at chair, board and executive levels. It demands he brings in competent, experienced professionals who can reverse the club\u2019s decline, and make the necessary changes to make Everton competitive once more.\u201d The Everton Shareholders\u2019 Association also issued a statement on Wednesday, saying it is in dialogue with Moshiri. \u201cOur views are consistent with those of other groups who want positive change that will bring about a better Everton Football Club,\u201d read the statement. However, Everton\u2019s owner has claimed that a restructure at the top of a club facing another fight for Premier League survival is not on his agenda. Moshiri adds: \u201cIn almost seven years since my arrival at the club, I have significantly increased my investment and our new stadium has become reality.  \u201cWe regularly review our performance and initiate change where we feel that the club falls short of standard. This has meant that we have seen turnover in managers, directors of football and several board members, but always as we have striven to achieve success. Whilst, in virtually every instance, change has been supported and encouraged by fans, stability must be the key to progression.\u201d Meanwhile, the Football Association has announced it can charge clubs if their fans are caught singing the \u201cChelsea rent boy\u201d chant. The chant has been heard at Chelsea\u2019s recent matches against Nottingham Forest and Manchester City, and also at Everton\u2019s match at Old Trafford on Friday, when it was aimed at Lampard, a former Chelsea player and manager. While the FA has always condemned the use of the term, it has never felt able to charge clubs over its use. However, it is understood the recent conviction of the Liverpool fan Paul Boardman, who admitted using the term on his way to last season\u2019s FA Cup final against Chelsea at Wembley, was a gamechanger, and opens the door for the FA to punish clubs where fans are proven to have used the term. An FA statement said: \u201cToday, the FA has formally written to all clubs across the Premier League, EFL, National League, Women\u2019s Super League, Women\u2019s Championship and Steps 2-4, to remind them that it can pursue formal disciplinary action against any club whose supporters engage in discriminatory behaviour, now including the use of the term \u2018rent boy\u2019. The FA has now informed all clubs that it considers the \u2018rent boy\u2019 chant to be a breach of the FA rules.\u201d"

                    "body": "More than 13 years have passed since the 68th and previous staging of a fixture which is 123 years old but on Saturday has only a fourth edition since 1972: Preston North End v Tottenham Hotspur. The last time the northern and southern Lilywhites clashed came on 23 September 2009 at Deepdale when Alan Irvine\u2019s Preston suffered a 5-1 loss to the Spurs of Harry Redknapp in a League Cup tie decorated by Peter Crouch\u2019s hat-trick and strikes from Robbie Keane and Jermain Defoe, the visitors also fielding Jermaine Jenas, Wilson Palacios and a youthful Gareth Bale. Preston\u2019s scorer was Chris Brown, whose 83rd-minute strike offered only a consolation. He believes the locals will offer the Premier League millionaires a rousing \u201cWelcome to Deepdale\u201d at 6pm on Saturday when Spurs take on Ryan Lowe\u2019s 11th-placed Championship side for an FA Cup fifth-round berth. Brown says: \u201cWhen Premier League teams come to Deepdale the fans seem to raise their noise levels \u2013 it\u2019s brilliant. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if there\u2019s a full house. It\u2019s a great place to play. I remember when we played Liverpool [the previous season] and Tottenham they came out in their droves and got behind their team.  \u201cAgainst Tottenham I came on as a sub and my lasting memory of that game is this: if you think back, Gareth Bale wasn\u2019t really firing on all cylinders, there was talk about him never being on the winning Spurs team, he was having a really rough time. \u201cI came on around the same time that Defoe was going off and as he was walking off he was saying to Harry Redknapp that Bale \u2018needs to buck his ideas up\u2019, basically. That he wasn\u2019t passing the ball to his feet. It was just mad to be standing there listening to that conversation, especially knowing where Gareth Bale soon went to in terms of his level of performance. \u201cCrouch played, Wilson Palacios too \u2013 so it was great to come on and play against those type of lads.\u201d Preston beat Huddersfield 3-1 in this season\u2019s third round, while Spurs dispatched Portsmouth 1-0, Harry Kane\u2019s winner a 265th goal for the club. After a 266th in Monday\u2019s league win over Fulham, he will eclipse Jimmy Greaves and become Spurs\u2019s outright record scorer if he registers today. That would be another page in the tale of the clubs\u2019 intertwined histories. Preston are the 1888-89 Invincibles and Double winners, achieving the FA Cup part without conceding. Tottenham\u2019s 1960-61 vintage were the first team of the last century to secure the Double. The XIs of Lowe and Antonio Conte will contest a 12th FA Cup clash between the teams. The first was on 27 January 1900: Preston were 1-0 winners at Deepdale in a first-round tie. Spurs were Southern League champions that season and then, next term, came the glory of a Cup triumph as the only non-league side to win it, after facing Preston in the opening round once again, dispatching them 4-1 in a replay following a 1-1 draw at White Hart Lane.  The relationship between the clubs had first deepened when Tottenham adopted the lilywhite jerseys of the Lancashire team in homage to William Sudell\u2019s Invincibles side. Preston\u2019s major trophy haul paused after the 1938 FA Cup final, the reverse to West Ham in the 1964 final a last taste of the big time. The decline started three years before with relegation from the old First Division. Preston have twice lost playoff finals to enter the top flight \u2013 under David Moyes in 2001 and Billy Davies in 2005 \u2013 and reached the semi-final the season before Spurs last visited Deepdale. \u201cA disappointment,\u201d says Brown, who was in the team eliminated by Sheffield United. The next year \u2013 2010 \u2013 this famous name of the English game avoided a winding-up order after the intervention of Trevor Hemmings, who took over, but still plunged into the third tier the following term. Last season Hemmings died and his son Craig oversees a club that last week announced a \u00a316.8m loss in 2021-22 \u2013 an increase of \u00a33.4m from the previous 12 months. Hemmings said: \u201c2021-22 was difficult \u2013 it was the first full season back with crowds following Covid restrictions, and in the first half we changed managers [from Frankie McAvoy to Lowe]. And it was the season we lost our owner, my father. All at the club hope to further his legacy.\u201d Peter Ridsdale, a former Leeds chairman, is a director at Preston, where Lowe has constructed a team that blend the loanees Liam Delap (a Manchester City striker) and \u00c1lvaro Fern\u00e1ndez (Manchester United defender) with the experience of Robbie Brady, a former Burnley winger, and Ched Evans, who after scoring six goals in seven games has signed a contract extension. Evans will hope to do what Brown did and score, though this time for a winning Preston side that would make another piece of history. \u201cMy goal was a tap-in, like most were,\u201d Brown jokes. \u201cBut you know what? Tottenham are a good team to play at the moment as there seems to be a bit of unrest there. I know Ryan Lowe is very positive and will put out the team to do exactly that.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 30 January 2023. Tottenham won the Double in 1960-61, not 1961-62 as an earlier version said."

                    "body": "The Seattle Sounders defeated Mexico\u2019s Pumas UNAM 5-2 on aggregate to win the Concacaf Champions League on Wednesday, ending Major League Soccer\u2019s long wait to lift the top club tournament for teams from North America, Central America and the Caribbean. Two goals from Peruvian international Raul Ruidiaz and a late strike from Uruguayan veteran Nicolas Lodeiro sealed a deserved 3-0 second leg victory in front of a tournament record crowd of 68,741 at Seattle\u2019s Lumen Field. Last week\u2019s first leg had ended in a 2-2 draw in Mexico City. The Sounders\u2019 victory ends 16 years of unbroken dominance by Mexican sides in the regional club tournament. No MLS club had been crowned champions of Concacaf since Los Angeles Galaxy lifted the title in 2000. Ruidiaz struck in the 45th and 80th minutes before Lodeiro lashed in a rebound in the 88th minute to spark wild celebrations amongst Seattle\u2019s passionate supporters. The title means Seattle will also become the first MLS side to advance to Fifa\u2019s Club World Cup tournament. A cagey opening 45 minutes saw Seattle forced to reorganize their defense and midfield after early injuries to left back Nouhou Tolo and midfield playmaker Joao Paulo. Tolo limped out of the fray after an ugly challenge from Pumas right back Jose Galindo, who earned a yellow card for a wild kick on the Cameroon international\u2019s thigh. Joao Paulo exited after 25 minutes following a clumsy challenge from Leonel Lopez, forcing Seattle coach Brian Schmetzer to bring on 16-year-old teenager Obed Vargas as a substitute. Until that moment, neither side had created much in the way of scoring changes, with Ruidiaz failing to trouble Pumas goalkeeper Alfredo Talavera with a 15th-minute header and a curling shot four minutes later. As the half wore on Pumas gradually gained a foothold and created the better chances. Washington Corozo squandered a golden opportunity in the 32nd minute after a floated through ball from Favio Alvarez caught the Seattle defense napping. With just goalkeeper Stefan Frei to beat, Corozo rushed an attempted lob and blazed over the bar with his first touch. But on the stroke of half-time Seattle broke the deadlock. A jinking run from Albert Rusnak carried the Slovakia international into the Pumas penalty area and his firmly hit low cross was met by Xavier Arreaga, who laid off for Ruidiaz. The Peruvian\u2019s shot took a wicked deflection off Diogo De Oliveira and Talavera could only watch helplessly as the ball rolled into the net. Seattle soaked up pressure in the second half as Pumas chased an equalizer, and only a fantastic reflex save from Sounders keeper Frei denied an equalizer from De Oliveira\u2019s thumping header. But as Pumas pressed forward, Seattle carved out openings on the counter-attack and 10 minutes from time Ruidiaz grabbed his second. Jordan Morris burst down the right flank and passed to Lodeiro who laid off for the Peruvian, who drilled his finish past Talavera. Lodeiro then put the seal on the victory in the 88th minute, thumping home a finish after Morris\u2019s shot rebounded off the woodwork."

                    "body": "In Gareth Southgate\u2019s own words, Jadon Sancho did not deserve an England call-up for last October\u2019s World Cup qualifiers against Andorra and Hungary and yet the manager selected him regardless. Sancho was enduring a difficult time at Manchester United after his \u00a373m transfer from Borussia Dortmund and, given his form, he ought not to have been included. But Southgate had invested in the winger, who he believes can get to the very top, and he decided \u201cfor him to feel we have belief in him at this point is a good message\u201d.  Sancho\u2019s previous action for England had been to miss one of the penalties in the Euro 2020 final shootout loss to Italy in July \u2013 he was injured for the September fixtures \u2013 and Southgate wanted to get him back in the shirt, partly to begin the healing process. Sancho would get two assists in the 5-0 win over Andorra. Things would get worse for Sancho before they got better. His performances for United did not improve in time for the November internationals and Southgate dropped him, saying that he could not support him for ever. But Sancho has since turned it around at United, playing some strong games, and Southgate is expected to recall him on Thursday for this month\u2019s Wembley friendlies against Switzerland and Ivory Coast. The reason for bringing up the Sancho situation is because it has direct relevance to Southgate\u2019s biggest selection dilemma: whether to call up Marcus Rashford. The parallels are clear. Rashford is enduring a torrid time at United and, given his form, does not merit being selected. The forward has been so frustrated by his lack of minutes under the club\u2019s interim manager, Ralf Rangnick, that he has given thought to leaving Old Trafford. Rangnick\u2019s response? \u201cEven suppose he and his agents or his family at one stage of the summer think about maybe going to another club, well then he can do that but in the summer,\u201d Rangnick said. \u201cNow the window is closed.\u201d  Rashford\u2019s last action for England was to miss one of the penalties against Italy because a shoulder operation and fitness issues ruled him out of the autumn international programme. He would benefit hugely from a change of environment, a show of support from Southgate, and the manager knows it. He loves Rashford, has counted on him as one of his key lieutenants and his empathetic side will want to pick him. But can he do so given the competition in wide attacking areas? Never mind Raheem Sterling, Bukayo Saka, Jack Grealish, Phil Foden and Sancho, there is an argument that Southgate ought to recall Harvey Barnes, who is playing well at Leicester. He won his only cap as a substitute in the friendly against Wales in October 2020. Southgate has other headaches, of course, as he prepares for the final friendlies before the World Cup in Qatar and, perhaps, the last opportunity for any experimentation. England have only two more camps before the tournament \u2013 in June and September, when they play four and two Nations League ties respectively. Harry Maguire is another United player horribly out of sorts and he suffered a blow to his already brittle confidence when the club\u2019s fans cheered his substitution in Tuesday\u2019s Champions League exit against Atl\u00e9tico Madrid. Southgate remains behind the centre-half and he will select him but expect Maguire\u2019s lack of form to be a hot topic \u2013 as it was last November. Southgate has injury problems in the wing-back roles, mainly on the left, with Ben Chilwell out for the season after cruciate surgery and Luke Shaw having missed United\u2019s past three matches. Kieran Trippier, who can provide an option on the left, is out with a fractured metatarsal.  Shaw is back in training and should be called up but he would be unlikely to start in both games, leading Southgate to consider the merits of Newcastle\u2019s Matt Targett and Crystal Palace\u2019s Tyrick Mitchell. Southgate\u2019s assistant, Steve Holland, watched Palace\u2019s 0-0 draw against Manchester City on Monday night, in which Mitchell excelled. On the other flank, Reece James is struggling with a muscular issue \u2013 he has missed Chelsea\u2019s past three games \u2013 and the midfielder Kalvin Phillips is out, raising the chances of Conor Gallagher being picked. Southgate must also consider whether he has room to recall Ben White in central defence and Ollie Watkins up front. Tammy Abraham, who has scored 15 goals in 21 games for Roma since the November international break, continues to look like Southgate\u2019s first change for Harry Kane. Abraham hopes to start one of the matches."

While we already knew that Manchester City and Liverpool were both quite good at football, Sunday\u2019s ding-dong at least served to reinforce that view, even if Liverpool were uncharacteristically poor in the first half before getting what one assumes was a gegen-rocket up the collective backside from J\u00fcrgen Klopp at the break. What we learned from one of the post-match interviews is that (1) Kevin De Bruyne knows Virgil van Dijk, (2) that the Manchester City midfielder sees Virgil a lot, (3) that his and Virgil\u2019s children attend the same school and (4) like to play together which (5) provided the background for their \u201cfriendly chat\u201d on the final whistle. These revelations that elite, gifted footballers aren\u2019t actually kept cryogenically frozen in chambers only to be thawed out for training and matches appear to have come as a shock to many viewers, who had no idea that the existence of top athletes can be as mundane, if not more crushingly dull than those lived by the rest of us. Or that both men live in Cheshire, hence the pow-wows on the school run.  It also went some way towards explaining why Pep Guardiola went full Basil Fawlty \u2013 without a trace of irony or awareness \u2013 when Van Dijk clipped De Bruyne to bring him down with a technical foul that could not have been more \u2018Fernandinho\u2019 if it had a shaved head, was sporting a big 25 on its back and was dancing the samba through Londrina\u2019s main drag. Despite his anger, Pep was all smiles after the game as he and his opposite number J\u00fcrgen Klopp wrapped each other in a warm and tight embrace. With ne\u2019er a flying pizza slice, an angry finger-wagging Irishman or a 22-man stramash involving a variety of fists and boots emerging from a cartoon cloud it has become abundantly clear that the rivalry between Liverpool and Manchester City is sadly lacking in the kind of sneering mutual contempt, childish needle and belligerent rancour that powers all the most entertaining feuds. Following a weekend in which Neil Warnock announced his retirement from management, perhaps one or both clubs could bring him in as an anger-management consultant to help generate some much-needed animosity.

                    "body": "With all due respect to Australia, where the Melbourne Cup is due to stop the nation at around 4am GMT on Tuesday, the attention of the racing world this week will focus squarely on the Kentucky bluegrass, and the 14 Grade One events that make up the 39th running of the Breeders\u2019 Cup at Keeneland in Lexington this weekend.\nThis news may also grate with diehard fans of the jumps, who will argue that the Grand Sefton Chase over the National fences at Aintree will generate far more betting turnover in the UK on Saturday than any of the events in Kentucky. But the simple fact remains that jumping is a niche activity in the global racing industry, enjoyed almost exclusively in Britain, Ireland and France, while the Breeders\u2019 Cup is the richest and most prestigious meeting of the year in the country which has, by several measures, the biggest racing and breeding industry on the planet.\n\nIt is also an industry that is showing distinct signs of turning a corner after many years when it seemed that American racing was doomed to inevitable \u2013 and often self-inflicted decline.\nThe Horse Racing Integrity and Safety Act \u2013 which, among other things, transfers responsibility for dope testing and medication rules away from individual state racing commissions \u2013 came into effect on 1 July. As a result, use of the raceday drug Lasix is expected to be steadily phased out across the US, and last year\u2019s Breeders\u2019 Cup was the first to be entirely Lasix-free.\n\nOther key indicators are also positive. The US\u2019s total \u201chandle\u201d, or turnover, on racing jumped by nearly 12% last year, to $12.2bn [\u00a310.6bn], the highest figure since 2009 despite a drop of 30% in the number of races (from 49,368 to 33,567) over the intervening dozen years. Total prize money, meanwhile, was $1.1bn [\u00a3956m], more than six times the UK figure of \u00a3146m on offer in around a third of the number of races.\nAs a result, John Quinn\u2019s Highfield Princess, already a Group One winner in three different countries in her last three starts, will be chasing the biggest pot of her career by some margin when she goes to post for the Breeders\u2019 Cup Turf Sprint on Saturday. And that is one of the six events with a purse of \u201conly\u201d $1m. Six more, including the Mile and the Filly &amp; Mare Turf, both of which have several leading contenders from European stables, are $2m races, while the Turf and Classic are worth $4m and $6m respectively.\nFor a relatively small \u2013 and, to my mind at least, still criminally under-appreciated \u2013 trainer like Quinn, it is an astonishing opportunity, and with the Wesley Ward-trained Golden Pal, the winner of the race for the last two seasons, also in the field, it promises to be a compelling spectacle for the fans too.\n\nIn all, there were 45 runners from outside the US among the 205 pre-entries for this year\u2019s meeting, including Nashwa, the likely favourite for the Filly &amp; Mare Turf on Saturday when Hollie Doyle will hope to get her first Breeders\u2019 Cup winner on the board. European-trained runners are favourite for six of the seven turf events, while Highfield Princess is a narrow second-favourite for the other.\nMost positive of all from an American perspective, meanwhile, is the prospect of a meeting that builds towards the Classic, the 14th and final Breeders\u2019 Cup race, on Saturday evening, when the exceptional Flightline will attempt to defend his unbeaten record against a field that includes Life Is Good, last year\u2019s winner of the Dirt Mile.\n\nFlightline\u2019s emergence as the highest-rated dirt horse since global rankings began has gone a little under the radar on this side of the Atlantic, but he is the superstar that American racing needs as it looks to maintain the recent upswing in its fortunes. His astonishing romp in the Pacific Classic at Del Mar in early September saw Flightline\u2019s rating leap to 139, just 1lb below Frankel\u2019s benchmark figure - for any surface - of 140, and with just five runs in the book at the age of four, there is every reason to think he can push that higher still on Saturday.\n\nEuropeans stables and viewers may concentrate on the turf events but Flightline is poised to join the likes of Secretariat, Man O\u2019 War and Seattle Slew on the list of America\u2019s greatest champions. Even the most fervent of jump-racing diehards could well find something to appreciate when he goes to post at 9.40pm."

As part of its goal of reaching net zero carbon by 2030 the sport will attempt to rationalise a calendar that is currently inefficient and detrimental in its environmental impact.\nIn 2019 F1 committed to reaching net zero and has been adopting new practices to fulfil its target. The sport published its report into the progress made on sustainability, diversity and inclusion on Tuesday. \nThe report catalogues F1\u2019s actions including introducing remote broadcasting operations, redesigning freight containers enabling the use of more efficient aeroplanes and using 100% renewable energy in the sport\u2019s offices.\n\nHowever by far the greatest part of F1\u2019s carbon footprint is generated by air travel to and from race meetings. Next year the calendar is still planned to be 24 races and includes, because of previously agreed contractual arrangements, scheduling that entails unnecessary flying. \nThe race in Miami is to be held immediately after Azerbaijan, Canada is set between Spain and Austria. Japan is followed by Qatar and then the US GP and at the end of the season, Las Vegas is followed by Abu Dhabi.\nThe report confirmed that \u201cplanning for a future calendar regionalisation was under way\u201d. It is expected the new schedule would see the sport compete in four regions, each hosting its own \u201cseason\u201d comprised of the Middle East, Europe, the Americas and east Asia/Australia.\nThe plans will likely be welcomed by the teams as they entail a cost saving in freight fees and will reduce travel for personnel during a lengthy season. There is, however, no timeline as yet for its implementation. It will take time, likely several years, as F1 requires existing contracts, which specify the time of year meetings are held, to end. There will also be negotiations required around races such as Abu Dhabi which pays a premium to be the last GP of the season.\nThe report also said F1 was on course to meet its target of using 100% carbon neutral, sustainable fuel by 2026 when the new engine regulations are applied. This year cars are using a fuel with a 10% sustainable ethanol element.\nBy 2026 the intent is to be running them on a 100% synthetic fuel, which is being developed. The fuel will be designed to work in road cars and neutral in that the process used to produce it would be carbon negative to offset the carbon produced by its use in an engine.\nEllen Jones, the head of sustainability at F1, welcomed the steps the sport had made in the last three years. \u201cIt\u2019s fantastic to see the progress that\u2019s been made already,\u201d she said. \u201cThe work that\u2019s going on behind the scenes to bring this strategy to life is tireless and we are confident that we are building strong foundations for the future of our business and sport.\u201d"

                    "body": "After definitive series wins over India and England this summer \u2013 and a total of 29 wins from their last 30 ODIs \u2013 Australia head into the Women\u2019s World Cup as overwhelming favourites. It\u2019s a familiar position for this team, who have dominated world cricket for many years. But this particular tournament brings more pressure than usual, and Australia are desperate to regain the trophy after failing to make the final last time out in 2017. It does not take a wild imagination to envisage Meg Lanning hoisting the trophy in Christchurch on 3 April, but a loss to India in the third ODI of the series in September and a comprehensive defeat at the hands of New Zealand in a warm up match this week have exposed some rare weaknesses.  The inability to take wickets \u2013 which was heavily exposed in the 2017 semi-final loss to India \u2013 was again a concern against the Black Ferns. Australia failed to defend a strong total of 321, taking only one wicket as Sophie Devine (161 not out) and Amelia Kerr (92 not out) chased down the total with ease and more than six overs to spare. Rival teams will have been taking notes on the way the Ferns were able to evade the bowling of the No 1-ranked ODI team. A World Cup is a different beast to a regular series; the tiniest slip up can spell the end of a team\u2019s chances, as Australia know all too well after a shock defeat to India in the first round of the 2020 T20 World Cup brought them close to exiting the tournament at the semi-final stage. An almost miraculous break in the weather allowed that match to be played and Australia progressed to the final, which they won, but it was a close-run thing. The format of this tournament allows a little more leeway for those slip ups. Rather than being divided into two pools, the eight teams will all each play each other once, with the top four progressing to the semis. It meams there will be plenty of opportunities to make up for any early loss, though the Australians will be keen to avoid meeting hosts New Zealand at the semi-final stage. But the cloud that looms largest over the entire tournament is Covid-19. Already all-rounder Ash Gardner has tested positive and is required to isolate for 10 days; she will miss the matches against England and Pakistan. All is being done to keep the players as safe as possible, but there remains the prospect that a swathe of positive tests could derail the Australians\u2019 campaign. The depth of the Matthew Mott\u2019s squad is enviable, but the loss of any one of the likes of Beth Mooney, Tahlia McGrath or Meg Lanning for a must-win game could see the trophy quickly fall from their grasp for another four years, even if the ICC has prepared for the eventuality of a Covid-impacted tournament. \u201cIf it becomes necessary, we would allow a team to field nine players as an exception for this environment and if they had female substitutes from within their management team, we would enable two substitutes to play, non-batting, non-bowling, but to enable a game to take place,\u201d said ICC head of events Chris Tetley.  It is an exception that would have been unthinkable in pre-pandemic times \u2013 a circumstance reserved for suburban park cricket and captains who spend their Fridays furiously texting everyone they know who has ever picked up a cricket bat to try to secure numbers for the next day\u2019s game. For a national team to take the field with only nine players \u2013 in a World Cup no less \u2013 would have seemed as unlikely as international cricket being played in empty stadiums. However, the world has changed and the sight of media managers and physiotherapists fielding at long on and extra cover may not even be a novelty by the end of this tournament. As the first major tournament for women\u2019s cricket since the pandemic took hold, there are more uncertainties than the teams are accustomed to. Australia have the form and results to suggest this World Cup is theirs for the taking, but the winner may well be the team that is best able to adjust to the changing circumstances of the world we now live in. Preparation and planning can be thrown out of the window in the blink of an eye and it is the Australians\u2019 adaptability that will be put under the microscope over the course of the next month."

                    "body": "  9.27pm    David Hytner was at Al Bayt Stadium, and his report is in. Congratulations to England, commiserations to Senegal, and thanks to you all for reading this MBM. Nighty night!      9.25pm    Gareth Southgate \u2013 who after all that pre-match noise, got the big call right, huh \u2013 talks to ITV, praising \u201cthe ruthlessness of our execution, the way our team worked off the ball and without the ball. We were a bit sticky with the bal in the first 25 to 30 minutes. Our best opportunities came from winning the ball from them, and Jude and Hendo were outstanding in that aspect of the game. They\u2019re both forward-thinking midfield players. Hendo doesn\u2019t get many for us, but he\u2019s been outstanding. He\u2019s such a leader, he knits the team together, around the camp he\u2019s brilliant, and his performances have been top drawer for us. It was important for Harry Kane and for us for him to score. We\u2019ve got some super young players, and it\u2019s been right to give them their head and their opportunity. These games are brilliant life experience for them. Their progress is phenomenal. The team have made a very complicated game tonight look straightforward. France are an outstanding team with a phenomenal tournament record and some outstanding individuals. So without a doubt it\u2019s a game where we\u2019ll have to find our highest possible level.\u201d As for Raheem Sterling, who is dealing with a family matter, Southgate reports: \u201cWe\u2019ve got to wait and see. At the moment, clearly the priority is for him to be with his family. We\u2019re going to support that, and leave him to have as much time as he needs. He\u2019s going home. At the moment it\u2019s a situation that he needs time with his family to deal with, and I don\u2019t want to put him under any pressure with that. Sometimes football isn\u2019t the most important thing, and family should come first.\u201d     9.14pm    Jude Bellingham\u2019s turn, and he\u2019s in the mood to big up a team-mate as well. \u201c\u201cThe first 35 minutes were tough. They were really compact, high-energy, athletic. They got in a few times down the sides, and it was one of those games when we needed to get the first goal. We knew when we did we\u2019d be in a good position. The goal was really well worked. [Jordan Henderson] had a brilliant performance today. I see some of the rubbish that was said about him playing. Honestly, it\u2019s ridiculous. He\u2019s so under-rated technically, and he\u2019s delivered again in a big game with a massive goal, so I think it\u2019s time he gets a bit of respect.\u201d   Updated at 9.24pm GMT    9.10pm    Phil Foden speaks to ITV. \u201cWe\u2019re all buzzing with the result. We\u2019re going to celebrate tonight, but it\u2019s knockout football, so we\u2019ll have to recover tomorrow and think about our next opponent, which is going to be really tough. Senegal are a great team. They\u2019d cause some big teams problems. They were very physical. But it\u2019s about buying time and trying to work out where the space was. I\u2019ve always spoken about bringing my club form to international level, and tonight was probably my best England game, so I\u2019m really happy. France look the strongest in the competition. Everywhere you look they have talent. But we\u2019ll back ourselves on the day. We\u2019re confident.\u201d \u2026 and now he\u2019s a senior member of the squad at the grand old age of 22, he\u2019s asked about his precocious 19-year-old team-mate. \u201cI don\u2019t want to big up Jude Bellingham too much because he\u2019s still young, but he\u2019s one of the most gifted players I\u2019ve ever seen. I don\u2019t see a weakness in his game. He\u2019s got everything, and he\u2019s going to be the best midfielder in the world, for sure.\u201d   Updated at 9.18pm GMT    9.03pm    A clearly delighted Harry Kane speaks to ITV. \u201cReally chuffed, you know. Knockout games are never easy. We\u2019ve showed great maturity through the tournament. It\u2019s 3-0 against a really good side. Credit to the boys. Their mentality was top from the beginning, and we took our chances when they came. We feel good. We\u2019ve got good runners. Good players. We\u2019re solid at the back. Three clean sheets in a row is really important. A really good day for us. We have a great mixture of youth and experience. Another knockout win. It was a very good night. We\u2019ll enjoy this one, but our focus turns to France. It\u2019ll be a really tough game, they\u2019re reigning champions, it\u2019ll be a good battle. We\u2019ll recover nicely and get ready for the game.\u201d   Updated at 9.11pm GMT    9.00pm    Gareth Southgate was wearing his poker face all evening, but he allows himself a broad, warm smile now! With the not-insignificant exception of a rocky spell midway through the first half \u2013 Jordan Pickford had to save well to deny Boulaye Dia \u2013 England were much the better team tonight and fully deserved their victory. Jordan Henderson, Harry Kane and Bukayo Saka scored fine goals, while Jude Bellingham was his usual precocious self. France and Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 will offer a much sterner test on Saturday, but the champions of Africa were made to look uncharacteristically ordinary for the most part tonight, so England deserve to bask in the glory for a while before contemplating their game against the champions of the world.     8.53pm   FULL TIME: England 3-0 Senegal  England have beaten the champions of Africa and are into the quarter finals of the World Cup! They\u2019ll face France on Saturday evening.   Updated at 8.57pm GMT    8.52pm    90 min +3: Dieng blooters the free kick witlessly into the wall but the ball breaks out for a corner kick. Ismaila Sarr takes, and Kane clears. Looks like a third clean sheet on the bounce is on!     8.51pm    90 min +2: Rice connects with the bottom of Dieng\u2019s boot and it\u2019s a free kick 25 yards out, just to the right of centre. Pickford\u2019s clean sheet \u2013 and Southgate\u2019s good mood, if his reaction to England shipping two goals late against Iran \u2013 in jeopardy here.   Updated at 8.59pm GMT    8.50pm    90 min +1: Shaw works his way down the left and dinks a cross towards Rashford at the far stick. Rashford can only hook the ball into the side netting. A fine chance to get one goal closer to Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 in the race for the Golden Boot goes begging.     8.48pm    90 min: In four minutes\u2019 time, England will officially be in the quarter finals of the World Cup.   Updated at 9.19pm GMT    8.48pm    89 min: Pape Sarr flays a wild shot 40 miles over the bar. Meanwhile the England band play Jingle Bells. Good fun and all, but it\u2019s not a patch on the earlier afro-funk.     8.46pm    87 min: A first corner of the evening for Senegal, out on the left. Ballo-Toure floats a cross into Pickford\u2019s hands. It\u2019s been a good day at the office for Pickford, whose strong arm to deny Dia when the score was 0-0 (kind of) turned this game.   Updated at 9.02pm GMT    8.45pm    86 min: Mount cynically clips the in-flight Dieng from behind, and this referee is laissez-faire all right.     8.43pm    84 min: A cross into the England box from the left. Ismaila Sarr heads harmlessly over. Pickford is furious that the half-chance was given up. A-rollocking he goes.     8.42pm    82 min: Henderson makes way for Phillips. Often under-appreciated, he receives a warm ovation from the England support. Meanwhile the drums and horns of Senegal have fallen quiet now. To be fair, they\u2019d been going at it non-stop since the get-go. A masterclass in the circular breathing technique that John Coltrane would be proud of.     8.38pm    80 min: Henderson sends Rashford scampering down the right. Rashford crosses for Kane, who extends a leg, Gazza-at-Euro-96 style. He can\u2019t poke home either.   Updated at 8.42pm GMT    8.36pm    78 min: An England free kick out on the left. Shaw curls it into the mixer. Neither Kane nor Rashford can get on the end of it. \u201cEngland are not letting the country down,\u201d writes John Neal, replying to Paul Griffin (61 min). \u201cThey are raising hopes to a fever pitch before the inevitable plucky loss on penalties to France.\u201d     8.35pm    77 min: A double change for England: Bellingham and Stones are replaced by Mount and Dier.   Updated at 8.40pm GMT    8.34pm    76 min: Koulibaly clatters crassly into the back of Kane, and turns out the referee does have his notebook with him after all. In he goes!     8.33pm    74 min: Everyone lines up on the edge of the box. Pape Sarr tries to shock Pickford by whipping the long-distance free kick towards the unguarded bottom-right corner. Think a mirror image of the free kick Gary McAllister scored for Liverpool in the Merseyside derby back in 2001. Anyway, Sarr isn\u2019t as accurate as McAllister, and the side netting rustles. Also, Pickford was quickly across and had it covered, unlike his Everton predecessor back in the day.     8.32pm    73 min: Diedhiou is into the thick of it immediately, bustling down the middle. He lays off to Dieng, who is bowled over by Shaw. Free kick in a central position, 30 yards out.     8.30pm    72 min: Dia makes way for Diedhiou.     8.28pm    70 min: Ismaila Sarr crosses from the left. The ball nestles harmlessly on the top of Pickford\u2019s net. Senegal haven\u2019t threatened to get back into this game at all. They were on top until England scored their first, at which point their belief went AWOL.     8.27pm    68 min: Mind you, it\u2019s not been a dirty or ill-tempered game, so the referee must be doing something right. Let him feel the love.   Updated at 9.16pm GMT    8.26pm    67 min: Nampalys Mendy comes crashing into Rice and becomes yet another player slightly fortunate not to go into the referee\u2019s notebook. Assuming the referee\u2019s got one, plus pencil, etc. It would explain a lot.     8.24pm    65 min: With England three up, Southgate takes the opportunity to refresh his front line. Saka and Foden, who have both excelled this evening, make way for Rashford and Grealish.     8.23pm    64 min: Henderson and Gueye accidentally knock knees. Henderson really felt that, but looks like he\u2019ll be good to continue.   Updated at 8.26pm GMT    8.22pm    63 min: England take it down a notch.      8.19pm    61 min: Bellingham slides in hard on Sabaly, and is lucky he fails to make contact. The referee makes do with a quiet word. \u201cI\u2019m not sure I approve of this ruthless, calm, ferociously kinetic performance,\u201d writes Paul Griffin. \u201cCould it be that by playing in this profoundly un-English way, our lads are in some way letting the country down?\u201d     8.18pm    59 min: England are in full flow. Kane finds Walker down the right. He\u2019s got team-mates to find in the middle, but batters his cross into the startled grid of the first man.     8.17pm   GOAL! England 3-0 Senegal (Saka 57)  Saka rewards Gareth Southgate for his selection! Foden skates down the left, past the sliding Sabaly, then the static Koulibaly, and crosses for Saka, who dinks elegantly, first time, over the sprawling, stranded Mendy. Another lovely goal!    Updated at 8.36pm GMT    8.15pm    56 min: Kane cuts in from the left and pearls a shot straight at Mendy from 25 yards. It should be an easy claim, but Mendy lets the ball squirt through his legs. The Senegal keeper is extremely lucky that the spin on the ball stops it dead, and he\u2019s able to flop over it. That could easily have flown into the net.     8.13pm    54 min: Kane slips Saka away down the inside-right channel. Saka aims for the top-right corner but the shot\u2019s always heading high and wide. England look extremely comfortable right now. Senegal haven\u2019t put anything together since the restart.   Updated at 8.17pm GMT    8.12pm    53 min: Foden drops deep in the pocket. He draws a couple of players before flicking a ball down the inside-left channel with a view to releasing Kane. Right idea, but the pass is overhit.     8.10pm    52 min: Senegal may be two down, but their fans are still giving it plenty. They\u2019ve been on the drums and horns all evening. A sensational soundtrack.   Updated at 8.13pm GMT    8.09pm    50 min: Sabaly cuts back from the byline to the right of the England goal. Pape Sarr has a whack from distance. He catches it well but the ball\u2019s always sailing wide right.     8.08pm    49 min: Bellingham is everywhere. He now races towards the Senegal box but is checked in the no-nonsense manner by Koulibaly. Senegal are living on the brink right now.     8.07pm    47 min: Jakobs\u2019 clearing header is poor, allowing Henderson to make good down the right. He reaches the byline and stands one up into the middle, but there\u2019s nobody there to score England\u2019s third. \u201cI\u2019m just back from the Co-op,\u201d reports Andrew Benton of pre-kick-off fame. Andrew might have some more shopping to do on Saturday evening, the way this is heading.     8.04pm    England get the second half underway. Senegal make three changes: Ndiaye, Diatta and Ciss are replaced by Gueye, Dieng and Pape Sarr. \u201cWhisper it but that run and ball of Bellingham for the second goal was a little reminiscent of Maradona putting in Caniggia for the winner against Brazil in 1990,\u201d opines Adam Hirst. \u201cThe one that made the Brazilian girl cry. A lighter version but similar movements and balance. He really is the business.\u201d   Updated at 8.10pm GMT    7.56pm    Half-time entertainment. A couple of in-form strikers are awaiting the winner of this one.       7.50pm   HALF TIME: England 2-0 Senegal  England started the half well, sagged worryingly, then finally hit their straps to hit Senegal with a late double whammy. Two fine goals, and England have one foot in the quarter finals. They\u2019re 45 minutes away from a showdown with France!     7.49pm   GOAL! England 2-0 Senegal (Kane 45+3)  Senegal have one last probe for an equaliser before the break. But then they\u2019re bit on the break. Bellingham steals the ball in the Senegal half. He draws a few green shirts but holds them off as he dribbles upfield. Then he slides a pass down the inside left for Foden, who immediately switches it back for Kane, romping free down the inside right. Kane enters the box, and he\u2019s always going to slot past Mendy and open his World Cup 2022 account. Finally. What a time to do it!     Updated at 8.04pm GMT    7.47pm    45 min +1: Saka crudely bodychecks Sarr, but he\u2019s not going into the book either. On this subject, Joe Pearson sent this in a good half-hour ago: \u201cReferee from El Salvador? Concacaf rules, then. Watch for a lot of physical play not being called. Just sayin\u2019.\u201d  Updated at 7.58pm GMT    7.46pm    45 min: Rice\u2019s low cross from the right is cut out by Koulibaly for another England corner. Foden looks for Bellingham but Senegal clear. There\u2019ll be two added minutes.     7.45pm    44 min: Henderson has by all accounts been mentoring Bellingham during this World Cup. They marked combining for the goal with a curious but sweet nose-to-nose celebration.   Updated at 7.54pm GMT    7.44pm    43 min: Bellingham slips Shaw into space down the left. Shaw enters the box, thinks about shooting, then thinks about crossing, then manages neither as Mendy ushers him away from goal. Shaw settles for a corner that leads to nothing.     7.42pm    42 min: England suddenly have their tails up. Saka bustles down the right again and curls into the centre for Foden, who can\u2019t get up high enough to send a header goalwards. Goal kick. Suddenly Senegal could do with hearing the half-time whistle.     7.41pm    41 min: It should be two. Pickford launches long. Saka skitters down the right and cuts back for Kane, who leans back and lifts a shot well over the bar from 12 yards.     7.40pm    40 min: Senegal were starting to get on top back there. But now look. That was a simple but lovely move, and it opened up Senegal with ease.     7.39pm   GOAL! England 1-0 Senegal (Henderson 39)  Kane drops deep to quarterback. He finds Bellingham with a sliderule pass down the inside-left channel. Bellingham reaches the Senegal box and rolls across for Henderson, who calmly steers a first-time shot across Mendy and into the bottom right!    Updated at 9.21pm GMT    7.38pm    38 min: Ndiaye has the opportunity to release Diatta into the England box down the inside-right channel but overcooks the pass. Goal kick. And then \u2026     7.37pm    37 min: Nothing comes of the resulting free kick.     7.37pm    36 min: Sarr picks Walker\u2019s pocket and makes off down the left wing. Walker tugs him back and should go into the book, but the referee only awards the free kick. Senegal coach Aliou Ciss\u00e9 demands Walker be shown the yellow card, but he\u2019s not getting his wish.     7.35pm    35 min: That really was a fine save by Pickford. Not only was the ball unpredictably ballooning up from the turf, Stones was also in the road attempting to block. He\u2019d have seen it late. What reactions.     7.33pm    33 min: Kane works the ball in from the left, looking for Saka in the Senegal box. Jakobs gets in between ball and man, allowing Edouard Mendy to come off his line to claim.     7.32pm    32 min: Saka cheaply gifts possession to Sarr down the left. Sarr cuts infield, thinks about shooting, then plays a cute reverse pass down the inside-left channel. Dia strides into the box and whistles a shot into the ground and across Pickford, in the direction of the bottom right. Pickford sticks out a strong arm to block brilliantly, and with Dia unable to react to the rebound, England are able to clear. Another good chance for Senegal!   Updated at 7.37pm GMT    7.30pm    30 min: A period of sustained patient Senegalese possession now. One for the purists at the moment, this match.     7.29pm    28 min: England slow the game right down. Again. Stones eventually gets fed up and tries a Hollywood pass. Intercepted. The ball breaks to Maguire who hoicks upfield with extreme prejudice. You\u2019ve seen better periods of play this month.     7.26pm    26 min: England take the sting out of the game with a little bit of sterile professionalism in the centre circle. Not the worst idea in the wake of that close call, Senegal with their tails up. \u201cJust imagine if this possession stat was tracked back in the old Crazy Gang days,\u201d writes Andy \u2018Not that one\u2019 Flintoff. \u201cWimbledon 20%, Watford 20%, 60% in contest.\u201d     7.24pm    24 min: There\u2019s a quick check by VAR for a penalty, but you can\u2019t be penalising Stones for that, and the game is soon underway again.     7.24pm    23 min: A huge chance for Senegal! Maguire\u2019s poor clearance is intercepted by Diatta, who crosses from the right. Dia highkicks on the penalty spot. The ball pings off Stones\u2019 knee and onto his forearm, then breaks to Sarr, who blazes over from six yards. What an opportunity!   Updated at 7.27pm GMT    7.21pm    21 min: Walker attempts to cut infield from the right. The ball pings off Sarr. Corner, though it takes the referee and linesman an absolute age to award it. More standing around. Eventually it\u2019s fired in by Foden. Stones heads-and-shoulders it wide and high right. Goal kick.   Updated at 7.26pm GMT    7.19pm    19 min: England suddenly slow down to a virtual halt. Maguire and Stones with the ball at their feet, the incredible standing men. There\u2019s patience and there\u2019s patience.     7.17pm    17 min: \u2026 so having said that, Ndiaye bothers Maguire down the right wing and nearly bursts clear. Stones comes across to make sure no serious problem develops for England.     7.16pm    16 min: Senegal are struggling to hold onto possession in the England half. How they\u2019ll be missing Sadio Man\u00e9. \u201cWhat is IN Contest\u2019s xG from all this possession?\u201d wonders Richard Hirst.     7.14pm    14 min: Diallo is a split second late on Kane and earns himself the first lecture of the match.   Updated at 7.19pm GMT    7.13pm    13 min: England are enjoying a fair bit of joy down the left flank. Kane whips in a cross that again has Edouard Mendy flapping. Saka trots into the six-yard box without too much conviction. A little more, and he might have trundled that home from close range.     7.12pm    12 min: England have enjoyed 60 percent of possession so far. Senegal just 25. The mysterious IN Contest makes off with his usual 15 percent share.     7.10pm    10 min: The ball is switched out. It\u2019s gone flat.   Updated at 7.16pm GMT    7.10pm    9 min: Edouard Mendy gives Diallo a hospital pass, and Saka nearly steals the ball away in the Senegal box. Mendy makes up for it by reclaiming possession. England come again, Bellingham swinging a gorgeous ball in from the left. Mendy continues to act skittishly, flapping at the cross, but there\u2019s nobody in a white shirt to take advantage.     7.08pm    8 min: England break out a training-ground move. The free kick\u2019s worked short to Walker on the right, then back towards Maguire on the left-hand corner of the six-yard box. Maguire hooks a cross into the centre. Senegal clear.   Updated at 7.13pm GMT    7.07pm    7 min: Bellingham wins another free kick, this time by working his way down the left only to be skittled by Diatta. England load the box. Shaw prepares to deliver.     7.06pm    6 min: Senegal are pressing England hard in these early exchanges. Ciss gets up in Bellingham\u2019s grille. A garden variety foul, but he\u2019s let the England midfielder know he\u2019s there.     7.05pm    4 min: Dia goes racing at speed down the inside-right channel and makes it all the way into the England box. Neither Maguire nor Stones look particularly happy as they give chase, but between them they manage to shut the door just in time, the ball coming off Maguire\u2019s shin and bobbling into Pickford\u2019s possession. That got the crowd going.   Updated at 7.10pm GMT    7.04pm    3 min: Henderson steals the ball off a snoozing Nampalys Mendy. For a second, it looked as though he\u2019d tear into a bit of space down the left, but the legs won\u2019t take him there. Henderson keeps probing, though, and nearly releases Foden into the box. The ball flies out for a goal kick.     7.02pm    2 min: Senegal ping the ball around hectically for a minute or so. Pickford blooters it into the stand. A fairly nondescript start.   Updated at 9.23pm GMT    7.00pm    England take the knee \u2026 and Senegal get the ball rolling. Here we go, then!   Updated at 7.05pm GMT    6.58pm    The teams are out! England in white, Senegal in green. A fantastic atmosphere bubbling up at the Al Bayt Stadium. We\u2019ll be off after the Senegalese national anthem Le Lion rouge, and the English equivalent God Save The [Mumbled Confusion]. Everyone still getting used to it, you see. \u201cThe last time I went to the Co-op, England scored two goals in quick succession,\u201d begins Andrew Benton. \u201cI\u2019m now in a quandary of sorts - should I go immediately at 7pm to ensure we get off to a good start and have a nice early dinner to boot, or bear the pangs of hunger until a bit later for a rip-roaring fightback?\u201d   Updated at 6.59pm GMT    6.51pm    Gareth Southgate is asked about Raheem Sterling\u2019s absence by ITV. \u201cHe\u2019s dealing with a family matter. I\u2019ve had quite a bit of time with him this morning, but I\u2019ve now had to pass that on to other people to help him with that. He\u2019s going to go and deal with that matter, and we\u2019ll have to take it from there.\u201d As for his team selection? \u201cSaka was excellent in our first two matches. Marcus was also very good. It\u2019s great to have him able to come into the game as it opens up. We have an embarrassment of riches in that area of the pitch. We\u2019ve liked Bukayo\u2019s performances, and think Phil and him deserve that opportunity.\u201d And what do England have to do to win? \u201cWe\u2019ve got to play our way. We\u2019ve got to play to our strengths. We\u2019ve shown what we\u2019re about in this tournament, and have to continue that tonight. Resilience, experience. You have to be able to adapt, adjust and respond to everything that is thrown at you. You have to be there with the answers, and we have to do that tonight.     6.45pm    The hotly* anticipated** return of PENNANT WATCH! The trinket Harry Kane will be handing over couldn\u2019t scream THIS\u2019LL DO more loudly if THIS\u2019LL DO was printed on it in 96-point type. The FA may as well print out a sheet of A4 and be done with it.  His opposite number Kalidou Koulibaly will present a much more lively number. Bold without being busy, colourful yet uncluttered. Mind you, a thicker, plusher, more generous helping of tasseling wouldn\u2019t have gone amiss. There\u2019s a thin line between decadence and desolation.  * barely** considered     6.19pm    Pre-match postbag o\u2019philosophical pondering. \u201cAccording to your French fellow MBMer at the RMC Sport, who I\u2019d like to think sips on a lovely burgundy throughout the match, Jules Kound\u00e9 has said that France don\u2019t have a preference for which side they face. In their shoes I\u2019d be more confident about outscoring the English offence than I would about getting past Koulibaly and company in the Senegalese defence\u201d \u2013 K\u00e1ri Tulinius. \u201cI think we (and various pundits) need to move beyond the idea that not playing from the start equates to being \u2018dropped\u2019, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s how the game works any more. If Southgate has a plan for the whole game, that should include judicious use of substitutes (probably including Rashford). If that plan works, then great. If it doesn\u2019t, then the pitchforks come out. Such is life, but the idea that a starting place always outranks coming off the bench seems outdated\u201d \u2013 Tom Hopkins. \u201cInteresting to know about the intra-African rivalries. On the other hand, with the possible exception of Brazil and Argentina, Latin Americans tend to cheer for whichever one of us is left in the tournament, even if our departure was at the hands of each other. In fact, I would say this goodwill extends even to Spain and the United States. Maybe rather than being continent based, it\u2019s based on a sense of shared identity? I wonder if the world marking us out as Latinos, a grouping which has no basis in race or ethnicity, makes it so we see ourselves as one precisely because the world groups us this way? I wonder\u201d \u2013 Casiano Martinez.     5.58pm    Bukayo Saka\u2019s replacement of Marcus Rashford is the one change to the England starting XI from the 3-0 defeat of Wales. Raheem Sterling is absent altogether as he deals with a family matter. Senegal are without defensive midfielder Idrissa Gueye. The Everton man picked up his second yellow of the tournament in the 2-1 win over Ecuador and is suspended. Nampalys Mendy of Leicester City takes over in midfield, while Monaco winger Krepin Diatta replaces Pape Gueye.     5.53pm   The teams  England: Pickford, Walker, Stones, Maguire, Shaw, Henderson, Rice, Bellingham, Saka, Kane, Foden.Subs: Grealish, Rashford, Trippier, Pope, Phillips, Dier, Coady, Alexander-Arnold, Mount, Ramsdale, Wilson, Maddison, Gallagher. Senegal: Edouard Mendy, Sabaly, Koulibaly, Diallo, Jakobs, Ciss, Nampalys Mendy, Ndiaye, Diatta, Ismaila Sarr, Dia.Subs: Seny Dieng, Formose Mendy, Cisse, Jackson, Moussa N\u2019Diaye, Ballo-Toure, Pape Sarr, Diedhiou, Ahmadou Dieng, Gomis, Name, Loum N\u2019Diaye, Pape Gueye. Referee: Ivan Barton (El Salvador).     5.51pm    Confirmation that Saka gets the nod over Rashford. In social-media form. The old-school way of doing things via the wires coming right up.      5.44pm    Bukayo Saka for Marcus Rashford: a contentious decision? It\u2019s not, is it. \u201cI\u2019m astonished Rashford isn\u2019t playing,\u201d said Gary Lineker on the BBC. But Gareth Southgate can\u2019t play everyone. Yes, Rashford is best-poised right now to chase down five-goal Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 for the Golden Boot, after scoring his second and third goals of this World Cup against Wales. But then Saka notched twice in an impressive performance against Iran. File this one under: Nice Problem To Have. Of course, as Jonathan Wilson pointed out the other day, if/when it goes the shape of a pear for England, Southgate will get it in the neck whatever he does, so he may as well call it as he sees it.      5.32pm    An update from Our Jacob via That Elon.      5.28pm    Some early team news courtesy of Jacob Steinberg in Qatar. \u201cWe\u2019re still waiting for confirmed team news but word at the Al Bayt Stadium is that Bukayo Saka and Phil Foden both start for England. Raheem Sterling has not won his place back. It means likely disappointment for Marcus Rashford, who has three goals in three games.\u201d   Updated at 5.45pm GMT    5.00pm   Preamble  The champions of Africa against the runners-up of Euro 2020. It\u2019s a big one, this, all right. But let\u2019s get it straight: tonight, Senegal will be representing the whole of Africa Senegal. As Nedum Onuoha explained on Football Weekly a couple of days ago, the notion that the entire continent cheers together as one \u201cneeds to be put in the bin\u201d (from 14m 57s). Fans of Nigeria, Ghana, Egypt and the Cote d\u2019Ivoire, to pull some random examples out of the ether, may have trenchant views on the possibility of the Lions of Teranga making it to the quarters. Having said that, from a Lions of Three perspective, it\u2019s still worth taking a quick look at England\u2019s record against African nations at the World Cup. They\u2019ve never lost, which is good news for those who use history as a crutch. However, they\u2019ve never really impressed either. A competent 2-0 win over Tunisia in 1998, a deserved last-gasp Harry Kane-inspired victory against the same opponents 20 years later, and that\u2019s about it. What else? A goalless draw against Morocco in 1986, during which Ray Wilkins lost the noggin, threw the ball at the ref, and became the first England player to be sent packing at the World Cup. A goalless draw against Algeria in 2010, after which Wayne Rooney\u2019s lid started to rattle disconcertingly, having a pop back at fans who were having a pop at him. A goalless draw against Nigeria in 2002 that was nondescript even by the standards of the Sven-Goran Eriksson era. And then there was Italia 90. England scraped past Egypt 1-0, then against Cameroon in the quarter-finals were, to quote Macka B, \u201clucky, lucky, very lucky, lucky\u201d.  So it\u2019s swings and roundabouts. A place in the quarter finals against France is the prize on offer. Kick off is at 7pm BST, 10pm at the Al Bayt Stadium in Al Khor. \u0627\u0646\u0647 \u064a\u062d\u062f\u062b! It\u2019s on!

                    "body": "With 23 minutes gone there was a moment of uproar inside the Cardiff City Stadium as Harry Wilson was blocked off outside the Austria penalty area; uproar that gave way almost immediately as Szymon Marciniak blew his whistle for the free-kick. Suddenly the air was alive with a weird kind of buzz, like the moment in a storm just before the lightning bolt hits and things start to lift: the hairs on your arms, seats flipped up, people in the stands starting to raise their hands above their heads. Gareth Bale paced it out and waited, charging the moment a little more.  There is a concept doing the rounds called \u201cmain character energy\u201d. It describes those people who communicate at all times the certainty that whatever might be happening around them, they are the main character in this scene. A way of standing, talking, entering a room. It says: the camera is on me. This is my close-up. Thanks so much for coming. This is quite a handy notion in sport. Main character energy: sports people need this stuff. Although not too much of it. And ideally, you actually are the main character. Welcome to Cardiff, \u00d6sterreichische Fussballnationalmannschaft. And thanks, really, for coming. Up to that point Bale had touched the ball 12 times. He\u2019d floated a header wide. He\u2019d tried to do some pressing. But was there ever any real doubt, as the ball was spotted and Bale took three paces back, who was doing the voiceover here, the cutaways? Not that this was ever really going to work. Just look at the theatre of it. One-off game, win or bust. The home crowd hero. His first real sighter. Of course it\u2019s thrilling, of course the crowd rises and stiffens. But people don\u2019t score goals like this. It\u2019s too difficult. It\u2019s also too difficult. The ball was 35 yard or so from goal at an angle. Heinz Lindner had a full wall in place. There was only one spot Bale could put it, and that would require dip, power and perfect accuracy. He\u2019s rusty. It\u2019s early on. Just saying, don\u2019t get your hopes \u2026 don\u2019t think that \u2026 Oh.  Bale took a hop, four steps, then hit the ball with the top of his foot in the familiar style. It wasn\u2019t really a spank or a rocket, but a clip: all about the rhythm and the ping; and let\u2019s just say it, with something of the golf shot. What was strange was the trajectory, the ball leaping, dipping, then travelling on in a flat line like a missile. Lindner stopped and craned his neck to look up as that lovely white orb, picked out in the cold Cardiff lights, grazed the bar and went spinning down in an orderly parabola, a thing of beauty even in that moment of hush before the seats erupted. In the stands people hugged and tumbled over one another. What really lingered was the softness in Bale\u2019s movements: perfect, hard-honed technique executed under pressure, but with an ease that spoke to something spreading back up the foot, the years spent slow-cooking that feeling of team culture, of shared momentum. In that moment Bale really was at home, doing home things.  The Cardiff City Stadium had been a slightly angsty place at kick-off. The Welsh anthem \u2013 a top three world anthem, up there with France and Italy \u2013 was, as ever, a stirring thing. And this World Cup playoff semi-final was a beautifully streamlined piece of staging. No need to consider developments elsewhere. Just win at home, then win the next one too. Fittingly enough for a high\u2011stakes, one-off casino trip of a game, Robert Page had loaded up every chip and swept it all into play. When it\u2019s win or bust, well, it makes a lot of sense to try for the win. So Page picked a team with all the players. A midfield of Joe Allen, Aaron Ramsey and Wilson was never likely to die wondering. In attack Wales had Bale and Daniel James, one to ferret and press for two men, one to provide the fantasy, the vibes. It did leave them open. On four minutes there was a moment of jaw-drop as Christoph Baumgartner strolled in on goal and saw the ball clang back off the bar. At times here was a large green space at the heart of this Welsh team, Allen trundling gamely around trying to fill the space like a lone forklift truck in an abandoned hangar.  Bale did little early on. This is fine. He doesn\u2019t have to do anything, until he does the thing. And on 51 minutes he did it again to make it 2-0. This was a wonderful team move, Ben Davies holding the ball, Bale taking it off his toe, and swinging it back across and into the top corner. Marcel Sabitzer\u2019s shot, deflected in off Davies, made it 2-1 with just under half an hour still to run. James kept passing up the chance to kill the game, but somehow this was always going one way. There is another act to play in this ensemble drama. But for one night only in Cardiff there was no doubt who was playing centre stage."

                    "body": "It was a freezing night in east London, but inside Little Baobab, an inconspicuous Senegalese restaurant hidden away in a building in Clapton, there was cautious buzz of optimism. Usually the venue hosts Senegalese musicians, often playing mbalax, a type of Senegalese and Gambian dance music. But tonight, it was all about the football, with the crowd of 40 or so largely hopeful their team could reach the quarter-finals of the World Cup for just the second time. Khadim Mbamba, the restaurant\u2019s chef, refused to sit, but chose instead to lean nervously against a chair at the very back of the room. \u201cSome people have told me Senegal only have a 15% chance of winning,\u201d he said. \u201cI would say 35%. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s going to be many goals, though. 1-0 or 2-1, maybe.\u201d For Mbamba, it\u2019s significant the team are led by Aliou Ciss\u00e9, a veteran of the famous 2002 campaign when Senegal beat then world champions France. \u201cWe were coached by French managers so long. Now, most of the African teams are coached by Africans. Every country has its own mentality. A Senegalese manager knows how to handle the team and deal with the players.\u201d The Senegalese team are no stranger to grief. In the year of the 2002 World Cup campaign, the MV Le Joola, a ferry that connects Senegalese coastal cities, sank and 1,863 people lost their lives. Eleven of them were relatives of Ciss\u00e9, and his sister was one of the dead. Two years ago, Papa Bouba Diop, the sole scorer in that famous victory against the French, died suddenly at the age of 42. The players led tributes to Diop ahead of their victory against Ecuador. Though their talisman, Sadio Man\u00e9, was cruelly injured before the tournament, and former Paris Saint-Germain Germain midfielder Idrissa Gueye was suspended, this is a Senegalese team with real quality \u2013 among them goalkeeper \u00c9douard Mendy and defender Kalidou Koulibaly, both of whom play for Chelsea. Ndene, a teacher and friend of Khadim, said that for some of the players who don\u2019t play at that level, competing in the knockout rounds of this tournament is an opportunity to earn themselves a move to a bigger club. \u201cEvery team wants to have Harry Kane. But the young Senegalese players really want to prove themselves,\u201d Ndene said. \u201cThere are some young players, 23 or 24 years old. Iliman Ndiaye [of Sheffield United] for example, who plays in the Championship. Next year he wants to be in the Premier League.\u201d Ahead of the kick-off, the Senegalese anthem was hummed discreetly by only a few in the restaurant, but as it went on, more and more joined in, until by the time of the crescendo it was raucous, people standing and belting out the tune. Then, as the game got under way, the room rang with yelps of encouragement and appeals to the referee, peaking when the video assistant referee denied Senegal a penalty after the ball cannoned off the hand of England defender John Stones. But the positivity drained from the room when England went 2-0 up in added time in the first half. At the break, the mood was subdued, with the Lions of Teranga 2-0 behind. Behind the projector screen showing the match, enticing smells emanated from stainless steel vats: small deep-fried pastries called fataya, mafe peanut butter and vegetable stew, chicken yassa with onions, caramelised with lime. Customers queued and the food restored some buoyancy. Ashley grew up in Leyton, and had been to Little Baobab before. \u201cUsually I\u2019d watch an England match at the pub,\u201d she said. \u201cBut to come here, to see the Senegalese culture, and eat the great food \u2013 it\u2019s a different experience.\u201d And there was still hope. Reuben is from Derbyshire, but lives in east London. \u201cI\u2019m British through and through,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I want to see an African country do well, just one time. I\u2019m happy whoever wins, but now, with Ghana and Cameroon out, it\u2019s all on Senegal.\u201d Michael, a French national of Senegalese descent, was upbeat. \u201cSenegal have been the better team. I think we have a chance of getting back into it.\u201d But then it was on again, and just before the hour mark, England added to their lead through Bukayo Saka. Underneath the traditional Senegalese fabric bunting hung from the ceiling, the mood fell flat. Some got up and left. The final whistle blew, and the current holders of the African Cup of Nations were out. There was applause at full-time. And then the mbalax started back up, rhythmic and intensely joyful. \u201cIt was expected. Now I\u2019m supporting France,\u201d said Michael. So what next? \u201cKeep Aliou as the coach. Now we just look forward to the next African Cup of Nations \u2026 and winning it again.\u201d"

                    "body": "In early March, military experts reported that Russian tanks were sporting handwritten \u201cZ\u201d symbols. The letter, thought to be a staunchly pro-war symbol of Vladimir Putin\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, was soon spotted at Russian bus stops, a school, then on a Russian gymnast\u2019s uniform during a World Cup event at Qatar. On 8 March, 18-year-old TikToker Matt Welland explained the symbol\u2019s meaning and its significance to his 2.4 million subscribers, along with the caption \u201cthe \u2018Z\u2019 symbol is more terrifying than you think\u201d. The scale of the influence of social media personalities such as Welland in disseminating current affairs was revealed last week. An Ofcom report found that, for the first time, Instagram was the most popular news source among teenagers, used by 29% of them in 2022, while 28% used TikTok and YouTube.  BBC One and BBC Two, previously the most popular news sources in this age group, were pushed down to fifth place, while TikTok saw the largest increase of any site, going from 1% of UK adults using the site in 2020 for news to 7% in 2022 \u2013 the same as Sky News\u2019 website and app. TikTok\u2019s growth is mostly down to young people, with half of its news users aged 16 to 24. Gully Burrows has nearly 464,000 TikTok subscribers and covers quirky news stories. One of his most popular videos on his channel (@gullyburrows) is \u201cwhat will happen when Philip dies\u201d. Published three weeks before the Duke of Edinburgh\u2019s death, it has had 16 million views. In it, Burrows speaks in front of a green screen and shows all the events that would follow Prince Philip\u2019s death, including the palace alerting the BBC and flags across the country being flown at half-mast. Burrows, previously a Mirror journalist and now a deputy editor at the National, said young people, and audiences more generally, wanted bitesize news they can fit into their busy schedule. \u201cPeople get bored quickly. They don\u2019t want to be dragged on,\u201d he said. \u201cNews needs to be incredibly precise.\u201d An age divide within the media has been growing for some time, he said. \u201cI did a placement at the Six O\u2019Clock News for BBC years ago, and young people just aren\u2019t watching that show,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople who work at ITV News say the same thing. Their demographic is 60-plus. People don\u2019t want to sit down and watch the news for a whole hour any more. If you sit down and watch BBC news, you\u2019ll probably hear 10 stories in a half-hour period, but you\u2019d get that in five or 10 minutes on TikTok.\u201d  Ilesanmi Oluwasikemi, 16, agreed: \u201cMost teenagers don\u2019t listen to the news on TV like older people.\u201d She said social media was a way to keep up with current affairs while scrolling. With 2.4 million subscribers, Welland has one of the biggest UK TikTok news accounts. His channel (@itsmattw_01) covers topics including \u201cwhat happens when a president leaves office\u201d and \u201cdumbest celebrity purchases\u201d. He shares clips in which he asks strangers questions such as, \u201cWhat conspiracy theory do you believe?\u201d \u201cI started in 2020,\u201d the student from West Sussex said. \u201cI always wanted to do YouTube but never thought I could get big on the platform.\u201d But with time on his hands during the pandemic, he gave TikTok a go. \u201cI began posting 20 videos a day and my channel got quite big.\u201d His videos regularly reach more than a million views, with his top performing hitting 11 million. He now wants to transition into traditional media. \u201cI want to make documentaries like Louis Theroux,\u201d he said of his career idol. For some young people, traditional news sources are near-irrelevant. Philip, 16, is interested in current affairs and gets his news through Instagram Stories \u2013 an in-app feature where posts disappear after 24 hours. \u201cThe only time I visit news sites is to look further into stories I\u2019ve heard of or seen,\u201d he said. \u201cPhysical newspapers are not of interest to me other than being good for starting the living room fire. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever bought or read a magazine either.\u201d  Some TikTokers feel they have cracked what young people want from news. Matilda Head, 21, set up a TikTok account (@matildasnewsroom) in 2021 as a student journalist and now has 18,000 followers. Personality is key, she said. \u201cAt first I\u2019d write a full script, but over time I began to add more of my character into my videos. Now I\u2019ll ad-lib so it\u2019s as if I\u2019m talking to a friend, like, \u2018Did you hear what happened in the Tory leadership debate?\u2019.\u201d Head is not surprised at the latest Ofcom figures, saying her own audience is driven in bulk from 13- to 25-year-olds. Welland reports a similar trend. \u201cYoung people feel they now have their own medium rather than being treated as junior \u2013 and often overlooked \u2013 participants in mainstream media publics,\u201d said Sonia Livingstone, professor in the department of media and communications at the London School of Economics. But for all its exciting potential, reliance on TikTok for news raises some issues. \u201cHateful fear-mongering disinformation has always been profitable,\u201d said Dr Zoetanya Sujon, senior lecturer at the London College of Communication. \u201cWhat TikTok brings is a very engaging, friendly platform that is really hard to regulate, with the personalised algorithm in its For You page. It\u2019s really hard to identify [problematic] content.\u201d \u201cIn the Johnny Depp/Amber Heard case, tons of accounts supported Depp through hashtags, such as, \u2018I stand with Johnny Depp\u2019 or \u2018Amber Heard is a Turd\u2019, getting millions of views and getting shared across all sorts of social media.\u201d"

There has been interest from the country in hosting an officially sanctioned Women\u2019s Tennis Association event, which the WTA has not yet pursued. A slew of current and former top players have already committed to the lucrative exhibition in December during the short off-season, including Norrie, who is the British No 1, Daniil Medvedev and Andrey Rublev of Russia, Alexander Zverev of Germany, Stan Wawrinka of Switzerland and Austria\u2019s Dominic Thiem. The inaugural edition was held in December 2019, which also featured Medvedev and Wawrinka. In a statement, Norrie said he would not be commenting on any political issues on his arrival in Saudi Arabia and that he is attending the Diriyah Tennis Cup to prepare for the Australian Open. \u201cI\u2019m not a politician and I don\u2019t feel it\u2019s right for me to get involved with individual government politics,\u201d said Norrie. \u201cMy job is to be a professional tennis player and this event in Saudi allows me to train with some of the best players in the world and to potentially win the Australian Open.\u201d Amnesty International UK\u2019s Felix Jakens suggested Norrie and others could use their presence in Saudi Arabia to show solidarity with Salma al-Shehab, the Leeds University student jailed for 34 years there for using Twitter. \u201cWe were never going to be telling people like Cameron Norrie where they should or shouldn\u2019t play tennis, but by appearing in Diriyah Cameron should realise he\u2019s effectively being deliberately hired in to take part in the latest jamboree of Saudi sportswashing,\u201d said Jakens. \u201cCameron has a big platform and genuine influence, and he should use this to show solidarity with people like Salma al-Shehab who are being cruelly persecuted in Saudi Arabia. What Saudi Arabia appears to look for with these competitions is a smiling high-profile sports star who will studiously avoid talking about human rights \u2013 Cameron should speak out.\u201d Up to seven-figure appearance fees have been offered to some top tennis players since the inaugural event in 2019, but not all have entertained them. Matt Gentry, Andy Murray\u2019s agent, revealed at the beginning of the year that he had turned down an offer to compete in the 2019 edition, which Murray echoed at Wimbledon. \u201cI know a number of the other guys on the tour were offered to play there. I don\u2019t think the player field that went was what they were hoping. A lot of the, I would say, top players and bigger names turned it down. And I personally wouldn\u2019t go and play there,\u201d said Murray. BSG Sports Group, the organisers\u2019 media team, have been approached for comment."

The match was postponed on Friday by the International Basketball Federation (Fiba) after an \u201cevaluation of the current security situation\u201d. The Netherlands\u2019 scheduled match against Russia, scheduled to take place on Saturday, was also pulled.\n\nOn Saturday, the Norwegian Ski Federation said it does not want Russian athletes competing at upcoming world cup races and world championships in Norway. Meanwhile the football associations of Poland and Sweden united in statements saying they refuse to play Russia in playoffs for the World Cup 2022.\nPatel, the UK\u2019s home secretary, tweeted: \u201cI have cancelled the visas of the Belarusian Men\u2019s Basketball Team who were due to play in Newcastle.\n\u201cThe UK will not welcome the national sports teams of those countries who are complicit in Putin\u2019s unprovoked and illegal invasion of Ukraine.\u201d\nBritain and Belarus had been due to play two matches \u2013 one in Minsk on Friday and the second at the Vertu Motors Arena, home to Newcastle Eagles, on Monday. Fiba first announced on Thursday that the Minsk game would be postponed before confirming the following day that the Newcastle game would also not go ahead. Following this latter decision it is understood that the Belarus team then cancelled their plans to travel to the UK.\nToni Minichiello, the interim chair of the British Basketball Federation (BBF), said in a statement: \u201cWe thank Fiba for all their help and for understanding our concerns about travelling to Minsk.\n\u201cI would also wish to take the opportunity thank the BBF Board, GB Team Staff and Players for coming together and presenting a unified position. The safety of our players and staff are and will always be our primary focus.\u201d\n\nElsewhere, Norway\u2019s skiiing federation said: \u201cRussia\u2019s violations of international law and attacks on the Ukrainian people demand international condemnation and sanctions. Sport is not detached from this and cannot remain passive to what is happening now.\n\u201cThe Norwegian Ski Federation\u2019s message to Russia and Russian athletes is crystal clear \u2013 we do not want your participation.\u201d\nNorway is scheduled to host events in Alpine skiing, cross country skiing, ski jumping and Nordic combined over the next few weeks. The federation added that it would follow up with the global body, the International Ski Federation (FIS).\n\nOn Friday FIS cancelled all remaining competitions of the 2021-22 season that were to be held in Russia but said Russian athletes can continue to participate in its competitions, in line with International Olympic Committee recommendations for international sports federations.\nWhile recommending that Russia\u2019s athletes be allowed to participate in events, the IOC urged federations to either move or cancel competitions currently planned in Russia or Belarus."

Her competitive instinct is really high and she\u2019s doing everything she can to try and make the Euros, so we\u2019ll see. She has a clear plan and we\u2019re in contact all the time.\u201d\n\nWiegman said the squad for the forthcoming World Cup qualifiers was \u201cclose\u201d to the group she hopes will contest the Euros but indicated there could be a place for the Manchester winger Chloe Kelly should she prove her fitness after major knee surgery.\n\u201cThe door is not closed to any other player but if anyone else comes in now it probably means we made the wrong decisions earlier,\u201d Wiegman joked before explaining she was keeping a \u201cclose eye\u201d on Kelly. \u201cShe\u2019s had a pretty tough injury, an ACL. Hopefully, she will play again very soon \u2013 that\u2019s what we expect. We know how good she was before she got injured but it will probably take a little time for her to get back to the level she\u2019s capable of.\u201d\n\nAlthough Fran Kirby remains integral to England\u2019s ambitions this summer, Chelsea\u2019s attacking playmaker has been omitted from this squad. Kirby has not featured in her club\u2019s past six matches and Emma Hayes, Chelsea\u2019s manager, recently said the 28-year-old needed a break after an intense schedule.\n\u201cFran Kirby\u2019s not ready to play,\u201d said Wiegman. \u201cWe don\u2019t know yet but we hope she\u2019ll be back on the pitch pretty soon.\u201d\nWith England having won all six qualifiers to date as they look to confirm their attendance at next year\u2019s World Cup in Australia and New Zealand, breaking into the squad is not easy but the Chelsea striker Beth England will hope to prove undroppable after replacing Kirby."

                    "body": "Rabbi Matondo describes missing out on a place in the Wales squad for the European Championship last summer as \u201cheartbreaking\u201d. The winger was overlooked after an underwhelming season and being sent home from a camp by the caretaker manager, Rob Page, for \u201cbreaching protocols\u201d a year ago. It was the end of a tough season for Matondo that started with an 8-0 defeat by Bayern Munich \u2013 one of only three Schalke appearances \u2013 and ended with a loan at Stoke. \u201cWhen you are growing up playing football you always dream about the big tournaments, like the Euros and World Cup,\u201d he says. \u201cBeing around the Wales team for the last two seasons consistently and then missing out on the most important camp was heartbreaking. \u201cDid I do enough throughout the season to get a chance? Probably not, but it hurt at the time. When you\u2019ve gone to previous camps and been there with the guys when we qualified for the Euros, missing out on the final step was a hard one to swallow. That gave me motivation and willpower to make sure something like that doesn\u2019t happen again. This season I am pushing myself.\u201d After an uncertain summer of injury and searching for a club, Matondo is firing with Cercle Brugge in the Belgian top flight, and is back in the Wales squad for their World Cup play-off at home to Austria on Thursday. Matondo has channelled his hurt to score nine goals in 24 games to help a club accustomed to relegation battles to mid-table safety and a fight for a place in Europe. The absence of Tyler Roberts and Kieffer Moore from the Wales squad means there is more pressure on Matondo, but he is thriving a year after his last Wales call-up was curtailed and left him with bridges to build.  \u201cI can\u2019t blame Rob Page for his decision; he made it on what he felt was right for the nation and what he wanted to do. He said what he needed to say, I said what I needed to say and at the end of the day he is the manager, he decides the team, he decides the squad and we move on. As much as I was upset, the team comes first. If the manager felt it was the right move for the squad, I guess it was. There wasn\u2019t much I could say \u2013 whatever I said wouldn\u2019t change his mind.\u201d Matondo\u2019s form in Belgium has been hard for Page to ignore. Cercle Brugge beat stiff competition from others in Europe to bring in the former Manchester City winger on loan from Schalke. The club have the youngest average age of any squad in Europe\u2019s top eight leagues as they look to create a springboard for players, led by a sporting director, Carlos Avi\u00f1a, who has overseen an overhaul at a club that shares an owner, the Russian Dmitry Rybolovlev, with Monaco. Club Brugge and Anderlecht are among the teams they have beaten this season. \u201cI was amazed by the faith showed in me by Cercle because other teams were maybe looking at me and thinking: \u2018Ermmm \u2026 he\u2019s injured and hasn\u2019t had the best of seasons before that, so it might be a risk getting him.\u2019 But the sporting director here was perfect with me. In getting me, he was a big factor, pushing me every step of the way to try to make this happen. In the end, it was the right move. \u201cMissing the Euros and being injured killed me a bit. That\u2019s why I felt it was really important when Cercle approached, showing that faith to give me that motivation to go into the next season, that when I get my opportunity, I stay fit, I stay out of trouble, I\u2019ll be firing for sure.\u201d The confidence is returning to a player who cost Schalke around \u00a311m as an 18-year-old in 2019. Things started promisingly in the Bundesliga for Matondo, who scored in a debut win against RB Leipzig, but a change of head coach and injuries stalled his progression in Germany and he was allowed to join Stoke in January 2021. Matondo admits he \u201cwas not at the races\u201d in his early Championship games as he recovered from injury but he ended his time in England in good form, and took that to Belgium after getting fit.  \u201cI have started 19, 20 games in the league. At the start I wasn\u2019t contributing with goals and assists but I was putting in some decent performances and they stuck with me and pushed me to play. Ultimately, when that first goal came the confidence started growing on the pitch. I have always believed in myself, given the opportunity, and when my confidence is there and I am playing regularly I can do my thing.\u201d Settling off the pitch has happened quickly, too, for Matondo, who is close friends at Cercle with the former Hull City midfielder Leonardo Lopes. \u201cIf I\u2019ve got a day off and we\u2019ve won or I\u2019ve scored, I feel I can treat myself to a little Belgian waffle \u2013 they\u2019re top notch.\u201d Wales fans will be hoping there is a need for a waffle in Cardiff on Friday morning."

                    "body": "Although Blaise Matuidi\u2019s time in MLS with Inter Miami did not provide the desired results on the pitch, his spell in Florida has helped inspire his next step. Matuidi has had an interest in business for a number of years, investing in various tech startups, including alongside the NBA star LeBron James. \u201cWhen I see athletes here in the United States, I think they have something different to European athletes and the difference is that they know about business. They are experts in their own field but they are also very focused in making other things in life, especially business,\u201d says the Frenchman.  \u201cI think in Europe our goals are in sport and we are focused on that. I think there are few players that are open-minded but a lot are focused only on the sport. I understand that, as we are born like that. In the academy, people say: \u2018I have to be focused only on football.\u2019 Here in the United States, it is something different as when sportspeople go to university they go with engineers, people who work with electrics, and they are all together. In Europe when we go to academies, we are only players. I think it is a big difference and that\u2019s when we create Origins.\u201d Origins is planned as a tech investment fund for athletes, including Matuidi\u2019s fellow World Cup winners N\u2019Golo Kante and Olivier Giroud. The athletes aim to pool their financial clout and social media influence to help grow new companies. Matuidi wants to show players they can look outside of sports for opportunities and show they are more than just athletes. Inter Miami co-owner David Beckham is a prime example of a footballer who has moved into the business world. When Matuidi was looking for a new challenge, it was his former Paris Saint-Germain teammate\u2019s new venture, Inter Miami, that came calling for his services, persuading him to leave Europe for the club\u2019s inaugural MLS season in 2020. Matuidi was left off the team\u2019s roster for the 2022 season, despite having a year remaining on his contract, leaving him more time to focus on his business interests. \u201cI played with David in the past at Paris Saint-Germain, not for too long but it was a good time,\u201d Matuidi says. \u201cI was happy because he had had this experience and he helped Paris Saint-Germain a lot. When I heard Inter Miami was interested in signing me, David was a big part of my thinking, so I was happy to join his team because he is an example with his experience, what he did in his great career and now as an owner for me is something special. \u201cOur relationship is good and he\u2019s a good guy, and he wants his team to win. When he says things, he does it. I have big respect for him. He doesn\u2019t speak to the players a lot but when he does you understand his goal and where he wants to go.\u201d Getting Matuidi to move to the MLS at the age of 32 was a coup for Inter Miami in their infancy, especially as he could have stayed in the relative comfort of Europe. \u201cFor me it was a new challenge. In Europe I played a lot of games, I won a lot of titles [three with Juventus and four with PSG] and was thinking that I needed something new for me and my family,\u201d he says. \u201cI decided to move on because my family was my first thought, and then the challenge. I know MLS is not like Europe, not in terms of quality, but for me it was something I wanted to do with this new challenge.\u201d Inter Miami are managed by another former teammate of Beckham\u2019s, Phil Neville. So far, his time in charge has been underwhelming: the club finished 10th and 11th in the Eastern Conference in their first two seasons, missing the playoffs on both occasions. This season has been even worse: they have lost three of their first four games, and have the worst record in the entire league.  Neville\u2019s job is under scrutiny \u2013 and Beckham may be in the awkward position of having to fire his friend \u2013 but the former England defender cannot be blamed entirely for the club\u2019s woes. Inter Miami are in rebuilding mode after the club were fined $2m and had wage sanctions imposed after an investigation found they violated roster designation rules for Matuidi and Andr\u00e9s Reyes. \u201cThere are a lot of young players,\u201d Matuidi says. \u201cIt is never easy when you are a new team, you need time and I think Inter Miami need time. It is not an easy league and you need a team with experience \u2026 If you look at Europe, a team like Manchester City before they won [the Premier League] it took time, as it did with Chelsea. When anyone plays Inter Miami, they want to beat us because we are one of the most popular teams in the league, that is why it is not easy.\u201d In footballing terms, Matuidi\u2019s future is uncertain. Gone are the days when Juventus paid PSG an initial \u20ac20m ($16m) for his services and his ambition of moving to England is long gone. \u201cIn the past I was close to moving to the Premier League, to Arsenal, that was my dream. I played in Italy and France, and a lot of people were saying: \u2018How you play, you need to move to the Premier League.\u2019 Unfortunately, I didn\u2019t, so you never know.\u201d Matuidi will be hoping he does not miss out on any opportunities in his other career."

His twisting run past three All Blacks in that match against the Barbarians in \u201973 is online, so is his whirlwind sprint down the wing against Scotland in that year\u2019s Five Nations, in what they called the greatest try never scored at Twickenham (and there\u2019s a conversation), and his side-step around Roger Blyth to score the opener when England played Wales in \u201974. There\u2019s a sharp finish, \u201cone of his specials\u201d, for Coventry against London Scottish in the Cup final later that same year, and bits and pieces of his Lions tour to New Zealand in \u201971, when he scored 11 tries in 16 games. Nothing that I can find, though, of the one Duckham, who died last week aged 76, scored on debut against Ireland at Lansdowne Road in \u201969. \u201cDuckham at once fed Rod Webb, his friend on the wing, and then looped round him for the return pass and a glorious, glorious try in the corner,\u201d Frank Keating wrote in this paper a few years later. \u201cThe nation exalted, and the official history still calls it the most daring try of recent years.\u201d England\u2019s history, maybe, but the one that counts is written by the winners. Ireland edged it 17-15 and Duckham\u2019s try didn\u2019t make the edit in their documentary about the game. \u201cI suppose I should have dived to make it perfect,\u201d he said afterwards, \u201cbut the ground was hard and frosty.\u201d  It\u2019s not much, but enough just to give you an idea of what it was like to watch him in his pomp, \u201cfair-hair streaming like a pre-Raphaelite angel,\u201d Keating wrote, \u201cwinged boots always no more than an inch from the touchline till he ducked inside with no more than a shrug of his hip.\u201d Wales\u2019s Mervyn Davies said you felt like you ought to be able to tackle him. \u201cFrom 10 yards away his side-step looked obvious and predictable, but then when you were there in close-up it still left you stranded and leaden-footed.\u201d Of course Keating loved him: \u201cWhat swiftness of foot and thought, what panache, sheer enchantment.\u201d All the romantics did. Rugby does those split-second moments, when a player breaks the game open, and everything starts to unspool in fast forward, better than any other sport. Even when you\u2019re watching them back in crackly black-and-white. Duckham\u2019s feet seemed to move even before his thoughts had ordered them to. Duckham\u2019s trouble was there weren\u2019t too many cavaliers involved in the running of English rugby back then (or before or since). He only scored 10 tries in his 39 Tests. Read through the match reports, and often as not all the talk is about why England never managed to get more out of him. Keating went along to Coventry to watch his very last game, against Bristol, \u201cit goes without saying that he hardly got a pass worth the name\u201d. The roundheads said it was Duckham\u2019s fault that he wasn\u2019t more involved, that he ought to go looking for the ball more instead of brooding on the wing like some faraway guard watching over the distant border. Duckham knew it too. \u201cIn the early days with England there was a totally different attitude,\u201d he said. \u201cWe took far more risks. It was fun. We were allowed scope to dare and scope to enjoy ourselves, try things. Then attitudes changed. International rugby became too intense. You had to win. Everything was stamped with a no-risk policy.\u201d Switched from the centre to wing, from wing to centre, then back to the wing again, Duckham said he ended up becoming his own worst enemy. \u201cWith so few chances I was wondering all the time if I could still do it in internationals, still run with the ball, still beat a man with speed.\u201d  It was no surprise that he played his best Test rugby for the Lions and Barbarians, when he was under the great coach Carwyn James. \u201cThe boring unthinking coach continually preaches about mistakes,\u201d James once wrote in his Guardian column, \u201cadventure and error go together.\u201d There haven\u2019t been many England coaches, or captains for that matter, who were willing to make that wager. Much to Duckham\u2019s frustration. He was one of the loudest critics of the England team during the 1991 World Cup, when, in the days before the final, he said he would be \u201cembarrassed and very sad\u201d if they won it by playing the boring sort of game that got them there to begin with. History doesn\u2019t record how he felt about the fact that they listened to him (and everyone else who was giving them stick) and then went on to lose 12-6 to Australia while trying to play in an entirely new style. As Ben Stokes showed in the last year of cricket, the secret to playing the game like losing doesn\u2019t matter is in knowing when you really can\u2019t afford to. The most dogged innings Stokes played for England last year was the 52 he made off 49 balls when the T20 World Cup final was on the line. Like his skipper Jos Buttler said afterwards: \u201cIf he batted like that in a Test match he\u2019d drop himself.\u201d There\u2019s talk the England rugby team may start playing the same sort of carefree way themselves. Believe it when you see it. Till then, \u201cWe\u2019ll take the three, please, referee.\u201d"

I still have to review it; that is why I don\u2019t have a clear lineup [yet] against United.\u201d\nAfter City beat Chelsea in last Thursday\u2019s league fixture at Stamford Bridge Guardiola rested key players for the FA Cup win against the same opposition at the Etihad Stadium on Sunday, including Erling Haaland and Kevin De Bruyne. Freshness will be a factor in Guardiola\u2019s selection for the derby.\n\u201cThe [Cup] game against Chelsea I made a lot of changes for one reason: how tired I saw some players after the game [in London], after the trip. We arrived too late back and in the training the day after I saw the players tired. It also depends on those who didn\u2019t play against Chelsea. I would like to arrive against United with the average of minutes in the legs of the players quite similar.\u201d\n\nGuardiola does not feel De Bruyne or Haaland necessarily need minutes against Southampton to be at their peak to face United. \u201cYou think about that but at the same time these players have played a lot of games in the last years. Kevin: if for four or five days he doesn\u2019t play, will he lose something? I don\u2019t think so. I don\u2019t think it is an issue if they do not play for eight or nine days.\u201d\nKalvin Phillips is poised to make his first City start at Southampton and Guardiola urged the midfielder to ensure Rodri \u201ccannot sleep\u201d by competing with the Spaniard for a regular place in the team.\n\u201cHe has to fight with Rodri for the benefit of all of us,\u201d he said. \u201cRodri cannot sleep and [has to] have the feeling there is someone close to him to do it.\u201d\nGuardiola was asked whether Phillips could win this battle. \u201cWhy not?\u201d he said. \u201cIt depends on him how he is able to fight with Rodri.\u201d"

                    "body": "If he\u2019s being honest, Sergio \u2018Checo\u2019 P\u00e9rez doesn\u2019t like the comparison. The veteran Formula One driver doesn\u2019t like to be held up against other prominent Mexican athletes, who \u2013 with the exception of him \u2013 have largely disappointed this year. \u201cYou have to give credit to the athletes who try, who get up every morning whether or not the results come in at the end of the day,\u201d P\u00e9rez recently said in Spanish. \u201cBut I think as Mexicans, we have to rid ourselves of the idea of who is better, who is worse, and always looking to pit Mexican athletes against each other.\u201d Nonetheless, he grasps that sports fans in his home country of 129m \u2013 eternally grappling with sometimes incomprehensible levels of poverty, violence and gubernatorial corruption \u2013 see him as perhaps their best hope to deliver whatever competitive glory may come in 2022.  Mexican boxer Saul \u2018Canelo\u2019 Alvarez fell off the top of his sport\u2019s pound-for-pound rankings after losing a decision to Dmitry Bivol in the light heavyweight division amid celebrations of Cinco de Mayo, which commemorates a famous victory over a French army in 1862. Despite securing a berth for the upcoming Fifa World Cup in Qatar, the men\u2019s national soccer team failed to defeat continental rivals USA or Canada during qualifying, putting into doubt whether the squad can hang with the global elite. And the men\u2019s U-20s failed to qualify for that age category\u2019s world championship, shaking confidence that there\u2019s youthful prospects waiting in the wings to return Mexico to regional \u2013 let alone international \u2013 prominence. Yet P\u00e9rez, 32, has interrupted the steady drumbeat of underachievement. In his second season with Red Bull Racing, he secured his first-ever pole position at the Saudi Arabian Grand Prix before picking up his third victory in F1 by topping the field at the legendary street circuit of Monaco. Video clips of his post-Monaco celebration \u2013 dancing on an opulent yacht with his arms around the waist of a blonde Ukrainian fashion model who was not his wife, before stumbling around as he disembarked the boat \u2013 spurred a tabloid controversy. He felt compelled to issue a public apology to his wife and fans acknowledging \u201ca bad party that [he] didn\u2019t know how to control\u201d, somewhat dampening news that Red Bull had chosen to extend him as reigning F1 champion Max Verstappen\u2019s teammate through 2024. P\u00e9rez, however, bounced back. He finished second only to Verstappen at the following race in Azerbaijan, securing his fifth podium of the season and helping Red Bull gash open an 80-point lead in the constructors\u2019 championship over second-place Ferrari. Mechanical problems then prevented him from finishing at the Canadian Grand Prix, but he was preparing to enter Sunday\u2019s race at England\u2019s mythical Silverstone circuit trailing only Verstappen in the world driver\u2019s championship. Verstappen\u2019s 46-point lead over P\u00e9rez is commanding, and pundits doubt Red Bull would really allow P\u00e9rez to jeopardize his Dutch teammate\u2019s bid at a second title. But publicly at least, team chief Christian Horner has said it doesn\u2019t matter which of his drivers clinches the individual championship as long as he\u2019s in a Red Bull car and the team can wrest away the team title from Mercedes, winners the last eight years running.  P\u00e9rez told the Guardian he\u2019s proceeding as if Horner\u2019s words were genuine \u2013 and believes they are. \u201cBoth championships are very important to me,\u201d said P\u00e9rez, whose team hasn\u2019t won a constructors\u2019 title since its fourth consecutive one in 2013. \u201cAnd we\u2019re in a great position for both right now, even if it\u2019s important to remember the season is long and everything can change so fast.\u201d Whatever happens, P\u00e9rez realizes even that tenuous spot was never guaranteed. He still remembers the restlessness that came when he was in the midst of setting the record for most F1 starts without a win: 190, during the first 10 seasons of his career. He finally snapped that ignominious streak late in the 2020 campaign, winning for Racing Point at the Sakhir Grand Prix, which that season\u2019s champion Lewis Hamilton missed due to illness and after P\u00e9rez dropped to last after an early crash that knocked out two drivers. \u201cI just knew it was important not to quit, to keep working, to keep looking for that big team that would give me the chance,\u201d P\u00e9rez said. Red Bull was that big team, pairing him with Verstappen in 2021 in the only car that could fight with Mercedes each round, after a series of drivers couldn\u2019t cut it as the team\u2019s No 2.  P\u00e9rez, in part, responded by winning his second F1 race at Baku in just his sixth outing with Red Bull, along with four other podium finishes. Another highlight that is almost certain to stand the test of time was his erasing of a seven-second gap between Verstappen and Hamilton in the campaign\u2019s finale in Abu Dhabi, which was key in positioning the former to pass the latter during the race\u2019s controversial, championship-deciding last lap. He said he\u2019s proud of what he\u2019s accomplished in surpassing the late Pedro Rodriguez as Mexico\u2019s winningest F1 driver. He said dreams of becoming the first Mexican to win his country\u2019s Grand Prix this fall \u2013 after finishing third there last year \u2013 burn brighter than ever. P\u00e9rez is quick to note that he\u2019s not the only racecar driver from Mexico to be etching a name for himself in autosport. He said he\u2019s relished each of Patricio \u2018Pato\u2019 O\u2019Ward\u2019s wins for Arrow McLaren in IndyCar, along with his second-place finish at the famed Indianapolis 500 on the same day P\u00e9rez ensured the notes of their national anthem blared in Monaco. He said he did the same when Mexican-born Nascar driver Danny Suarez scored his maiden victory at Sonoma on 12 June \u2013 on the same day their countryman Roberto Gonz\u00e1lez helped Jota Sport top the LMP2 class at the 24 Hours of Le Mans endurance race. But P\u00e9rez knows F1 is the peak of his profession. And for now, he knows only he can determine whether or not his sports-obsessed home country can savor a constructors\u2019 championship or \u2013 why not? \u2013 a driver\u2019s title. \u201cIt\u2019s a grand responsibility,\u201d P\u00e9rez said. \u201cBut it\u2019s very special to be representing your country to the world at the highest level.\u201d Note: P\u00e9rez finished second at the British Grand Prix on 3 July 2022, earning his sixth podium of the season."

FIVER LETTERS \u201cO\u2019Rangers\u2019 visit to Seville reminded me of a story about the last time they reached a final abroad, in 1972. After the match in Barcelona, there were so many fans worse for wear in the city centre that the police just rounded them up, took them to the airport and packed them on to waiting charter flights, without checking any tickets. This was all well and good, except for a group of men who gradually sobered up during the flight home, and then remembered that they had driven to the match\u201d \u2013 Geoff Coxon. \u201cIt appears that Divock Origi will be joining Milan from Liverpool.

                    "body": "The Heineken Cup was universally recognised for years as the great success story of the professional era. It is the same age, the first match played on Halloween in 1995, a Tuesday night, on the shores of the Black Sea, when Toulouse beat Farul Constanta of Romania 54-10 in front of two men and a dog. Within a decade it was being heralded by no less an authority than the Observer as the greatest rugby tournament. More colourful than regular domestic competitions; more competitive than the World Cup; more teams than the Six Nations or (as was then) the Tri Nations. On the eve of the 10th season, in 2004, our late correspondent Eddie Butler described the competition as a \u201cnew cultural experience\u201d to rival the Six Nations.  The northern hemisphere had just produced its first (and to date only) world champions, and, get this, the cumulative deficit of the nine Premiership clubs who filed accounts that season was a little over \u00a31m. Four of them were in profit. The salary cap was \u00a32m. How times change. As we sit on the eve of the 28th edition, which kicks off on Friday on the shores of the Thames, when London Irish host Montpellier, does anyone feel the same way about the competition that in its heyday not even the most curmudgeonly would flinch at calling by its sponsor\u2019s name? Do we even know what its name is now? Heineken are still sponsors, or at least they returned as such in 2018, after four years away. At some point, presumably to try to jazz things up (and/or copy football), someone introduced the word \u201cChampions\u201d into the nomenclature. This season they have introduced South African teams into the playing roster, which will undoubtedly bring a new dimension, but somewhat makes a mockery of the initialism EPCR, where E stands for European. Then again, maybe Brexit had done that already. In keeping with the times, something feels out of joint with professional rugby\u2019s beloved child, which, to save the reader looking it up, is now officially known as the Heineken Champions Cup. Covid has hit all competitions hard (see the Premiership), but this is the only one to have had a weekend squeezed out of its calendar. In order to accommodate the chaos of the 2020-21 season, the classic six-pool format was abandoned in favour of the unwieldy two pools of 12 that now pertain, to be contested over four weekends. There can be no pools of death in this setup. The format was positioned as a temporary arrangement while the world got back to normal, but here we are preparing for its third season. Having lost two weekends in October in exchange for an extra weekend (a knockout round of 16) in April, a reversion to the previous structure would be a mathematical impossibility as it stands.  Last week, the launch of this season\u2019s iteration took place in a shiny hotel in a woodland near the M25. In keeping with the mandatory hype of these events, EPCR\u2019s chairman, Dominic McKay, performed admirably, but he acknowledged it is not within his gift to reclaim the lost weekend. Bad news, Dom. That means it is never coming back. Worse still, the rumours persist about a world club championship. Given the South Africans now play up here, and more and more of the best players from New Zealand and Australia are taking up contracts here too, that very idea is becoming correspondingly redundant. All the same, talks are now sufficiently advanced that McKay was able to speculate on its likely format. Answer: every four years the Heineken Champions Cup will forgo anything so trivial as its knockout stages, in order to see how a handful of New Zealand teams might compare against the best of Europe. And South Africa. It is true that football has a Club World Cup, but it is difficult to imagine the Champions League accommodating it in such a way. The Heineken/Champions Cup has become as vulnerable as any other institution in rugby\u2019s adopted model of free-market economics. Originally, it was an aberration, a competition run by the unions for the clubs, revenues split six ways, which meant, in effect, the richer leagues (French and English) subsidised the rest.  The shift from Heineken to Champions took place in 2014, when the clubs pulled rank. Now they run the show, with the unions little more than sitting at the table. The South African union is not even that. Until it becomes a partner, we can consider their participation a sort of trial. South Africa is desperate for meaningful competition for its best teams, but then EPCR is desperate for a fillip for its flagship competition. This might be seen as a perfect match. Then again, everyone is desperate in a free-market model, bar the wealthiest. With the recent tribulations of the Premiership, that pretty much equates to the French these days, with honourable mention for the Irish, although this competition is far more important to the latter. The whispers at the launch were that the success or otherwise of the South African experiment will boil down to how the French clubs take to the travel and logistics. The French are in the ascendancy, which is more about the size of their economy and rugby\u2019s place within it than about the comings and goings of great players. They boast the past two Champions Cup winners and six of the past eight semi-finalists. Increasingly, the rugby world is gravitating around them. That includes the competition that for a while was the best in the world. \u2022 This is an extract from our weekly rugby union email, the Breakdown.

                    "body": "Taras Stepanenko was 17 when he made his professional debut for Metalurh Zaporizhzhya, in a 3-1 defeat by Dynamo Kyiv. He was a fine passer of the ball who almost from the beginning read the game with the assurance of a player several years his senior. Great things were expected of him and he seemed on track when he moved to Shakhtar just before his 21st birthday. Twelve years on, though, Stepanenko is still at Shakhtar at the age of 32. He may have won seven Ukrainian Premier League titles and seven Ukrainian Cups but there is a sense of a talent that never quite delivered on its potential. He\u2019s played only 262 minutes in the knockout stage of the Champions League, completed only two knockout matches in the competition, and one of those was a 7-0 defeat to Bayern Munich in 2015.  Perhaps he was never quite the elite talent he appeared to be, somebody who had he been born in England might have come to be celebrated as a great servant of a mid-table Premier League side. But it may also be that he rather plateaued, stuck at a team that dominates domestically without the desire or the opportunity to leave his home country for greater challenges abroad. That is the football way of looking at things. Were these normal times, we would then move on to talking about whether Stepanenko, who demonstrated flickers of his ability at the Euros, might yet have one last job in him, whether he might be able to drive Ukraine to victory over Wales on Sunday and inspire them to their first World Cup since 2006. There would probably have been analysis of how he shut down John McGinn in Wednesday\u2019s World Cup qualifier, restricting the main creative presence in Scotland\u2019s midfield to one key pass and a 60% pass accuracy, while maintaining an 86% pass accuracy himself. And there would have been consideration of how Wales, although they too operate with a back three, structure their midfield differently, so it is harder to isolate one man linking to the forwards. Joe Morrell, who usually plays as the central figure, sits much deeper, with the players flanking him, probably Joe Allen and Harry Wilson although Aaron Ramsey may have a role, pushing on. That might mean Oleksandr Zinchenko having to sit deeper in midfield, rather than occupying the roving left-sided role he did against Scotland and through much of the Euros.  Perhaps there might have been reflections on his personality. Stepanenko has a hinterland. Before going to France for the Euros in 2016, he spoke about how Louis de Fun\u00e8s, an actor and comedian who died in 1983, had shaped his image of the country. He reads a lot, particularly biographies \u2013 Alex Ferguson, Zlatan Ibrahimovic, Napoleon. He admits he has twice started but failed to finish Don Quixote. He knows his wines, favouring dry Italian reds, particularly valpolicella. His wife, Marharyta, is an excellent chef, having studied under H\u00e9ctor Jim\u00e9nez-Bravo. The Spenanenkos love escape rooms \u2013 \u201cThey develop logical thinking, the head starts to work, and they\u2019re a good way to unwind a little\u201d. He is also a devout Christian, which seems to lie behind the scepticism he has expressed about tattoos. \u201cI already remember the names of people close to me,\u201d he said. \u201cI love them, and the addition of a tattoo would not make me love them even more. Besides, I once read that tattoos are pagan symbols. Although our Brazilians [at Shakhtar] all seem to be pious and they stick on both Jesus and the Virgin Mary. So maybe it\u2019s a personal matter.\u201d  If that makes him sound thoughtful and cultured, there is also a volatility. The head-high lunge that earned him a red card against Moldova in 2013 was pretty much as bad as challenges get, although it was probably born of recklessness rather than malice. It should also be said he has only been sent off twice at club level, both for two bookings. One of those came in 2016 for his part in a brawl at the end of a game between Shakhtar and Dynamo. The previous year, Andriy Yarmolenko had committed a dreadful foul on him and although the two exchanged shirts at the end of the game, Yarmolenko then tossed Stepanenko\u2019s to the ground, leading to months of bad blood. But these are not normal times and this is a story with ramifications far beyond football. Stepanenko and Yarmolenko have long since made up and, even if they had not, there would surely have been a sense that a row over a discarded shirt meant little alongside the greater cause for which Ukraine are now fighting.  As Steve Clarke made clear after Scotland\u2019s defeat by Ukraine on Wednesday, all the emotion and all the togetherness in the world does not matter without a tactical plan, and Stepanenko will be key to that, not only for the position he occupies but for his organisational brain. But among the many messages he received after Wednesday\u2019s win, some were from friends fighting on the frontline. The sporting narrative says this could be Stepanenko\u2019s time at last; the real world renders those cliches trite. Doing it for Ukraine has never meant so much."

                    "body": "  4.21pm    Thank you very much for joining me. Here is Simon Mail\u2019s report from Spurs \u2026   Updated at 4.23pm GMT    4.10pm    Spurs failed to have a shot on target in the second half, which sums it up nicely.      4.00pm    \u201cWill, on a positive note the quality of entertainment can only go up from here. Right? Please.\u201d There is always hope Mary Waltz.      3.59pm    \u201cHow much longer before Harry Kane demands a transfer?\u201d asks Mike Mackenzie. He might not be too keen on staying on under Conte next season \u2026   Updated at 4.01pm GMT    3.57pm    Spurs just could not create anything of note. It was a submissive display from them. They need Bentancur, Kulusevski and Richarlison back soon.      3.56pm    There was quality in the assists for the two goals from Villa. Watkins did supremely well to beat Lloris to the ball and set up Buendia and the McGinn pass for Douglas Luiz was excellent.      3.55pm   Full-time: Tottenham 0-2 Aston Villa  Villa executed Emery\u2019s game plan perfectly, biding their time to get the opener and then controlling the game. Spurs were awful.   Updated at 3.58pm GMT    3.54pm    90+6 mins: Villa look far more like scoring a third than Spurs do of pulling one back. Watkins heads a corner over the bar to prove my point.      3.52pm    90+4 mins: Chambers is mainly on the pitch to foul Son and is booked after a couple in quick succession. Whatever keeps Spurs out of the Villa half, I guess.      3.50pm    90+2 mins: The crowd and team have been flat today. No one even cares there are seven minutes left to score twice in.     3.48pm    90 mins: Timewasting and what not mean we will endure seven more minutes of this.   Updated at 3.52pm GMT    3.46pm    88 mins: Son cuts in and whacks a shot at goal but Bednarek stops it before it can trouble Olsen.  Skipp and Spence are coming on for Hojbjerg and Perisic. Not sure what these two can offer.      3.44pm    86 mins: Spurs have been pretty awful overall. Limited creativity. They are missing some of their more creative players but they should be doing better than this.  Romero absolutely smashes into Coutinho on the touchline for no reason whatsoever and should receive a second booking but a throw-in is awarded instead. How odd. \u201cKulusevski is the only Spurs player that consistently provides offensive spark,\u201d suggests Jim Boyd. \u201cYou can tell he\u2019s not playing without being told. Need him today.\u201dThey could also use that World Cup version of Richarlison.\u201d     3.42pm    84 mins: Villa get a corner on the right but it is header clear at the front post.   K\u00e1ri Tulinius says: \u201cI think that, mainly, Spurs haven\u2019t won anything big lately because of randomness. They could well have won any number of trophies in the last decade, but the proverbial ball didn\u2019t bounce for them. That said, once a team has had a run of bad luck, that does start to affect players psychologically.\u201d     3.40pm    82 mins: A triple change for Villa: Chambers, Ings and Bednarek and on. Buendia, Douglas Luiz and Konsa off.      3.38pm    80 mins: Douglas Luiz whacks another shot at Lloris but he holds on this time. The Brazilian is left in a heap after twisting his knee after taking the shot. It looks like he will be coming off. Pape Sarr is on for his Tottenham debut, alongside Emerson Royal. Bissouma and Doherty depart.   Updated at 3.49pm GMT    3.36pm    78 mins: Alexandra Ashton emails: \u201cIn response to Dominic (68\u2019 ), I have absolutely no idea why we\u2019ve declined so rapidly from the highs of last season. Granted, a lot of sides in the league have massively improved over the summer, but for the past three months or so we\u2019ve looked like last season\u2019s Burnley.\"In fact, I might even favour Kompany\u2019s Burnley, top of the Championship, against us at the moment. And we concede a goal as I was writing this, so that\u2019s a fantastic omen of the year to come.\u201d  Joe Pearson loves McGinn\u2019s pass: \u201cIndeed a great goal, but that assist! Chef\u2019s kiss!\u201d Coutinho is coming on to replace the stricken McGinn.     3.34pm    76 mins: Villa have been the better team since the opener and Spurs really cannot offer much in response.  McGinn seems to pull up with a hamstring issue.  At this point, Spurs might as well bring Dier on up top.      3.32pm    74 mins: Villa win the ball back from Kane in the Spurs half. A pass finds McGinn who lifts the ball into the box for Douglas Luiz, he takes a touch and then calmly dinks his shot beyond Lloris.   Updated at 3.45pm GMT    3.31pm   GOAL! Tottenham 0-2 Aston Villa (Douglas Luiz, 74)  A neat finish from the Brazilian.   Updated at 3.36pm GMT    3.30pm    72 mins: Hojbjerg and Bissouma are just so passive in central midfield. Neither providing the passing ability that Spurs currently need in there. Bissouma aims a long pass to the corner and it just breezes out for a throw-in.      3.28pm    70 mins: David Dein emails his opinion in response to Bogdan Kotarlic (58 mins): \u201cCan be answered in a single sentence. Daniel Levy has run the club really badly, with appalling choices at critical moments.\u201d We will assume, for now, it is not that David Dein.   Updated at 3.35pm GMT    3.26pm    68 mins: Some nice one-touch from Spurs ends with Son nudging the ball to Kane inside the box but it bounces to an awkward height and he can only slash the ball wide. Dominic Salmon emails: \u201cAt the beginning of the season, Spurs couldn\u2019t lay a glove on any of the top teams, only managing a supremely jammy point out of the Chelsea game, now we\u2019re making heavy weather and playing like turgid lumps of unwanted pudding batter against EVERY team in the league. Onwards and backwards!\u201d   Updated at 3.29pm GMT    3.24pm    66 mins: Cash is coming on for Bailey. Villa are looking to be more defensive already, it would seem. Looks like Cash will operate ahead of Young.  Villa are wasting time and Konsa is booked for taking an age to take a free-kick. He seems upset but he has set his own downfall.      3.22pm    64 mins: Watkins receives a pass from Buendia inside the box but he takes too long to shoot and Doherty gets in the way.      3.20pm    62 mins: Spurs break from a Villa corner. It looks like Kane has played Son through down the left but Young reads the danger and slides in to intercept.  Perisic swings in a corner from the right \u2026 and straight out for a goal kick. Sessegnon replaces Gil.      3.18pm    60 mins: Bissouma is the latest Spurs man in the book. His crime is clipping the ankles of Kamara 3o yards out. Douglas Luiz takes the free-kick but it flicks off the wall and out for a corner.  \u201cThis is like city yesterday,\u201d says Jeff Sachs. \u201cThey win the possession competition but don\u2019t score the winning goals\u201d     3.16pm    58 mins: Bogdan Kotarlic asks: \u201cWhat (or who) is the main reason that the Spurs haven\u2019t won a trophy in the last few years? I mean, they have got some excellent players, good managers, a lot of passionate supporters but every season it is the same old story, no trophies, wasted years, wasted talent, wasted money...\u201d I think it would take a book to explain.     3.15pm    57 mins: The ball bounces to Perisic in the box, he takes a touch and then hits his shot over while leaning back.   Updated at 3.27pm GMT    3.14pm    57 mins: Kane is taken out by Mings when trying to thread a through ball, because that\u2019s what he does. The centre-back gets a booking for his troubles.      3.13pm    56 mins: If you are into gamesmanship, then the remaining 35 minutes here could be right up your street. Villa look keen to waste as much time as possible.   Updated at 3.23pm GMT    3.12pm    54 mins: Villa have looked comfortable in defence thus far and Spurs do not have much in the way of changes to make, so they will be ecstatic by the situation.     3.10pm    52 mins: This means that Spurs have conceded first in their past seven matches in the Premier League. What a ludicrous record.  Jeff Sachs emails: \u201cPathetic Spurs.\u201d     3.08pm    50 mins: Douglas Luiz takes aim from 30 yards, his shot bounces in front of Lloris who cannot hold it, allowing Watkins to reach the rebound first, take a touch and pass to Buendia to slot home from 12 yards.      3.08pm   GOAL! Spurs 0-1 Aston Villa (Buendia, 50)  That\u2019s a turn up for the books!   Updated at 3.14pm GMT    3.07pm    49 mins: It is all Spurs in the opening few minutes. Villa are just inviting the pressure on and Spurs are happy to endeavour to find an opening \u2013 currently without success.  \u201cI\u2019m not sure there are no game changers on the Spurs bench,\u201d says Joe Pearson. \u201cTanganga always seems inches away from getting sent off. That would change the game!\u201d      3.05pm    47 mins: Roger Kirkby has a plan: \u201cHappy New Year Will, it\u2019s games like these where you wish there was a rule to make 2 players from each team having to be in the opponent\u2019s half at all times. They can\u2019t be offside and must be at least 10 yards from the halfway line. It\u2019s just drab, drab football.\u201d     3.03pm   Second half  Here we go again!      2.59pm    A reminder of the Spurs bench \u2026 Subs: Forster, Dier, Tanganga, Sanchez, Sessegnon, Emerson Royal, Spence, Sarr, Skipp Apart from Sessegnon, you would not back any of them to really change the game.      2.54pm    There will be plenty of focus in the half-time analysis of the one shot on target. I cannot wait.      2.52pm    \u201cGood morning and Happy New Year from Pittsburgh!\u201d Happy New Year Eric Peterson. \u201cImpressed to see Spurs play those last five minutes of the first half like they\u2019d already fallen behind. That\u2019s progress.\u201d A great resolution from Spurs.      2.48pm    \u201cC\u2019mon Will,\u201d says Mary Waltz, \u201cdon\u2019t you get it? Both teams realize many of their fans a suffering from post New Year\u2019s hangovers and don\u2019t want to upset them with too much action.\u201d I think those people need something to focus on.     2.47pm   Half time: Tottenham 0-0 Aston Villa  Aston Villa have made themselves very hard to break down and therefore this half has been rather tedious.   Updated at 2.51pm GMT    2.45pm    45 mins: Two minutes added on.     2.44pm    44 mins: Son looks to find Kane in space inside the box but he puts too much on his pass, allowing Olsen to come out and claim.  Moments later Son whips in a cross from the left, which hits Young on the elbow just outside the box. A free-kick is given. Son lines up the set-piece to the left of the area. He shoots but it is straight at Olsen.      2.42pm    42 mins: Finally, a bit of excitement. But it is followed up with a couple of minutes of Spurs knocking the ball around.      2.41pm    40 mins: Off the line! Spurs\u2019 patient buildup pays off. A ball is played over for Perisic to latch onto; he forces Olsen out of his net and crosses to Kane at the back post to nod at the goalkeeper-less goal, only for Young to dive to his right to head clear.   Updated at 2.45pm GMT    2.38pm    38 mins: Davies is the third Spurs centre-back to be booked. He jumps into a tackle on Young, leaving the Villa man on the turf. Considering Villa have barely attacked, it is impressive that Davies, Lenglet and Romero have all been cautioned. It should be said, all of them were pretty needless.   Updated at 2.44pm GMT    2.36pm    36 mins: Watching this match requires plenty of patience. It is frankly underwhelming. We are still awaiting a shot on target. There have only been three off target to be fair.      2.34pm    34 mins: Villa do not seem to know how to attack when they do get the all in the Spurs half. It is all a bit slow. They seem quite happy to let Spurs have possession and pass the ball side to side.  Joe Pearson emails: \u201cGoogle wants me to make Ciorba de Perisoare when I search for \u2018Romanian sour soup\u2019. But it has meatballs, so probably not the same.\u201d  I am sure there are many various styles.      2.32pm    32 mins: Olsen catches a cross and immediately throws it out for Watkins to chase but his progress is immediately halted by Lenglet pulling him down. The Frenchman is booked for his troubles.      2.30pm    30 mins: Son swings in a corner from the left but it is dreadful and Young volleys clear from the front post.  \u201cIf Villa are playing with six at the back is that parking the mini-bus?\u201d asks David Paradine. I see it as more of a transit van.      2.29pm    28 mins: Mings gives the ball away with a long pass down the pitch but makes amends by whacking into the back of Son to head clear. Romero is back (and in the book). The World Cup winner jumps in with two feet off the ground and goes straight through Watkins. An impressively crap challenge.   Updated at 2.37pm GMT    2.26pm    26 mins: I am not sure Bryan Gil has touched the ball yet. Watkins and Bissouma go for the same ball on the edge of the Villa box. Watkins catches his opponent with a boot on the arm but Bissouma still goes down clutching his head. He eventually gets up.      2.25pm    24 mins: Young is down on the deck after clattering into Davies. Villa do have Cash on the bench, at least.  It is bors. \u2018The ingredient bor\u0219 consists of water in which wheat or barley bran, sometimes sugar beet or a slice of bread have fermented.\u2019      2.22pm    22 mins: Aston Villa are playing very deep whenever Spurs get the ball. Emery is very keen on organisation and being tough to break down. I think they currently have six at the back. It is working because Spurs can only pass the ball sideways or backwards.  Good to have options.       2.20pm    20 mins: Son runs back and makes a tackle after losing the ball. He is so frustrated with himself that he removes his Zorro mask to offer protection after suffering a fractured eye socket and throws it off the pitch.   Updated at 2.35pm GMT    2.18pm    18 mins: Neither goalkeeper has been called upon to make a save thus far and the crowd seems a bit flat. It is classic New Year\u2019s Day fare.      2.16pm    16 mins: Doherty chests down a crossfield pass but runs straight into Digne, causing the Spurs man to go down. He shouts at the ref to demand a free-kick on the edge of the box and he should get one but the man in black waves play on.      2.14pm    14 mins: Doherty drives into the box and looks like he is about to shoot from close range but Kamara reads the dangers and gets across just in time to turn the right-back\u2019s effort behind.  \u201cHappy New Year Will!\u201d Happy New Year, Yash Gupta. \u201cEven before World Cup it became clear Arsenal will finish ahead and to be honest, it hurts but it is what it is. Spurs last won league back in 1961. I\u2019ve only seen us win 1 trophy. It has always been about moments in this comedy club which I absolutely adore. So yeah looking forward to Gil balling it and hopefully he scores 2 goals instead of being coming off after 30 minutes. Come on!\u201d     2.13pm    12 mins: \u201cOK Will, I will bite,\u201d says Mary Waltz. \u201cWhat exactly is Romanian soup? General ingredients? Brothy or Stew like? Oh, HNY to the entire MBM universe.\u201d Basically \u2026 you boil a chicken in a pan with some veg, bay leaf etc. At the end you add some souring agent (it\u2019s some niche stuff purchased from the local Romanian store). For a more detailed answer, I will ask my mother-in-law at half-time.     2.10pm    10 mins: Watkins times his run well and collects the ball in space on the left before cutting in onto his right foot, only to drag his shot wide. \u201cI\u2019ve held the opinion that Mings is a borderline dirty player. But I guess that is part of the center back profile?\u201d asks Joe Pearson. He has committed a few bad fouls in his time, that\u2019s for sure, but I do not think he is dirty overall.   Updated at 2.14pm GMT    2.09pm    8 mins: Buendia passes the ball out of play rather than to teammate Digne.  It is all pretty even on the pitch, with far more fouls than attacking happening.      2.07pm    6 mins: Son tries to instigate a break but Bailey decides to take him down crudely, mainly out of frustration for not being awarded a free-kick moments earlier.  Spurs knock the ball over the top for Perisic to chase but a free-kick is awarded against him for a little nudge on Young. A weak decision from the ref.      2.05pm    4 mins: Mings takes a few touches too many, then flies into a challenge with Bissouma. Mings is one of those Premier League players I have never been convinced by. Prove me wrong, Tyrone.  Gary Stover emails: \u201cRomanian soup sounds good, but Romanian pizza is the big deal now.\u201d Soup does not give away your location. I hope.     2.02pm    2 mins: Villa enjoy the majority of possession in the early stages. Bissouma takes down Douglas Luiz around 35 yards from goal to give away a free-kick. Spurs do like a slow start after all \u2026     2.00pm   Kick off  Peep! Peep! Peep! Here we go!     2.00pm    We will start with a minute\u2019s applause for Pele and former Spurs player Maurice Norman.     1.56pm    The players are in the tunnel. I would argue Villa have the better pre-match jacket but I am open to persuasion.      1.50pm    Just tucking into some Romanian sour soup pre-match. I live a weird life.      1.48pm    Unai Emery on Martinez being on the bench: \u201cIt was our plann. He needed time to rest. He has trained two times. We have Robin Olsen and we trust our players.\u201d On the match: \u201cWe did good play against Liverpool but were disappointed with the result. We need to keep the same mentality and we will win.\u201d     1.45pm    Leon Bailey: \u201cWe are still building, we are lot more understanding of the manager. It is a process for us, we are going to take things step-by-step. It is a big game, we are going to stick to our game plan. \u201cThe game plan today is to create a lot of opportunities. Hopefully we can take one of them.\u201d These on-pitch interviews a mind-boggling, mainly due to the laboured questioning and over-excited camera work. I am not sure it is worth it.      1.36pm    Conte: \u201cIt is very important to have Hugo and Romero in the starting XI. They are in good physical condition and recovered mentally. \u201cIn the last games we have conceded the first goal and we have had to come back. We need to pay more attention.\u201d Son: \u201cIt is very important we finish in a top four position and we have that in our hands. We need to start well.\u201d     1.29pm    Dejan Kulusevski is missing with a muscle problem picked up in training. He is set to undergo a scan tomorrow and Conte hopes he will only miss a single match.      1.28pm    \u201cHow is Cristian Romero in the squad today?\u201d asks Alec Butcher. \u201cSurely he\u2019s still nursing the world\u2019s biggest hangover? Also Gil gets a rare start but expect him to be hooked at 39 mins when Spurs go 0-2 down as is our custom recently. Nice to Pape Sarr and Djed make bench.\u201d Romero is just a committed professional.   Updated at 2.04pm GMT    1.24pm    Unai Emery is back in north London. He had a somewhat underwhelming spell as Arsene Wenger\u2019s successor. He has won half of his four games in charge of Villa and will see how close his team are to being able to challenge the top six.      1.19pm    Naturally, there is another Premier League match after this one. Here is my look at Forest and the year ahead.       1.17pm    Bryan Gil gets his first Premier League start for Spurs since joining the club in 2021. He is only 21 still, so has time to develop and flourish under Antonio Conte. Today would be a good time to show what he can offer.      1.10pm    How has your Premier League done in the first half of the season? We asked the fans.       1.04pm    Emi Martinez is left on the bench for Villa but Cristian Romero starts for Spurs. Go figure.   Updated at 1.15pm GMT    1.03pm   Starting lineups  Tottenham (3-4-3): Lloris; Romero, Lenglet, Davies; Doherty, Hojbjerg, Bissouma, Perisic; Gil, Kane, Son Subs: Forster, Dier, Tanganga, Sanchez, Sessegnon, Emerson Royal, Spence, Sarr, Skipp Aston Villa (4-3-3): Olsen; Young, Konsa, Mings, Digne; McGinn, Douglas Luiz, Kamara; Buendia, Watkins, Bailey Subs: Martinez, Cash, Sanson, Ings, Chambers, Augustinsson, Bednarek, Coutinho, Archer  Updated at 1.03pm GMT    1.00pm   Hello  Happy New Year! I hope you have all set your resolutions for 2023. Harry Kane admits his is the same every year: to improve. It is a nice idea but at some point he will regress, so he should just cut back on the sugar or something.  We have, in theory, a re-run of the World Cup final with Hugo Lloris in one goal and Emi Martinez down the other end trying to control his urge to sexualise his goalkeeper gloves. Nor should we forget that Cristian Romero is available for Antonio Conte. It is a slightly different setting to Qatar and we might not get the thriller the final provided but I am optimistic of a decent match.  Villa were turned over by Liverpool in their Premier League return, so will be hoping to kickstart the second half of the season under Unai Emery today, but that is easier said than done.  Spurs have won 12 of the past 14 meetings between the two sides, a sign of their dominance in this fixture. They are struggling for consistency under Conte, perfectly summarised by their comeback draw at Brentford on Boxing Day.  Both sides will be looking to start the year with a bang. Let\u2019s hope it\u2019s a cracker! Kick-off: 2pm GMT  "

                    "body": "The chair of the disability royal commission has written to Australian airline and airport chiefs about improving their treatment of travellers with disabilities, after the inquiry heard stories of people dropped on the floor and discrimination against assistance dogs. The royal commission has so far heard that people with disabilities are routinely subject to violence, abuse, neglect and exploitation when flying domestically, with participants telling the inquiry they felt airlines were \u201cdehumanising\u201d them and that complaints were rarely followed up. Advocates have told Guardian Australia that complaining through the Australian Human Rights Commission is often the only way to seek recourse. In a letter sent to the various chief executives this week, Ronald Sackville KC outlined concerns that people with disabilities have reported to the royal commission, with travellers frequently facing \u201cinaccessible facilities and services\u201d and \u201cunhelpful practices and systems adopted by airlines\u201d.  Sackville listed shortcomings raised by people with disabilities that airlines and airports could address to make flying \u201ca more inclusive experience\u201d. \u201cPeople with disability often experience avoidable challenges when travelling by air,\u201d Sackville wrote. \u201cMore can be done by airlines and domestic airports to address those challenges.\u201d Sackville wrote about how people with disabilities had told the commission that their wheelchairs had been damaged during travel and that airlines had not taken responsibility to rectify the issue.  Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup  He also outlined stories of travellers with disability who were dropped on the floor because the hoist that accommodates wheelchairs was not being used correctly by air staff. Limited access to safe ramps and discrimination against people who rely on assistance dogs was also flagged by the commissioner. Sackville\u2019s letter follows workshops with 60 Australians with a disability last year about their experiences, which also found that discrimination and poor service were more prominent amid flight cancellations \u2013 which were at record levels in the middle of last year. People with disabilities said they were seen as an \u201cafterthought\u201d when passengers on cancelled flights were managed. \u201cWhen issues are brought to them, they are easily dismissed and not taken seriously,\u201d one participant said. The royal commission\u2019s insights follow the Guardian\u2019s reporting of travellers with a disability being rejected assistance and left stranded at airports \u2013 with their complaints falling on deaf ears. In August, Tony Jones, who relies on a wheelchair due to a spinal cord injury, lodged a complaint with the Australian Human Rights Commission after he was turned away at the gate when trying to board a Jetstar flight in Sydney. Lawyers representing Jones have said there are low levels of industry compliance with disability standards, and that the onus is not on airlines and airports to comply but rather on individuals to make discrimination complaints \u2013 with the AHRC the only avenue. In June, a French national with severe spinal cord damage after being shot during a terrorist attack in Paris said he was left in an airbridge at Sydney airport with his young family for more than an hour. In December, a man requiring a wheelchair said he was removed from his Qatar Airways flight after boarding the plane and left stranded at Melbourne airport because of his disability. A statement on behalf of Qantas and Jetstar said the airline group was \u201cconsidering the matters raised\u201d. \u201cQantas and Jetstar are working hard to improve the experience for customers with accessibility needs.\u201d A Virgin Australia spokesperson said it would be giving the royal commission\u2019s letter \u201cvery close consideration\u201d. \u201cWe know how important it is to ensure we make airline travel inclusive and accessible for all our guests.\u201d Guardian Australia also contacted Rex for comment. Speaking generally about the issues air travellers with disability face, James Goodwin, the chief executive of the Australian Airports Association, said the industry had launched initiatives with members about hidden disabilities. Goodwin also said issues had been more pronounced in the past year given the pandemic exodus of aviation staff and a largely new, less experienced workforce filling their shoes. \u201cAirports continue to work with other parts of the industry \u2013 including government agencies that operate at airports \u2013 and stakeholders to share information so we can continue to promote inclusive and consistent practices,\u201d Goodwin said."

                    "body": "Good morning. Yesterday afternoon, Suella Braverman visited the Manston asylum processing centre. The home secretary arrived from Dover, about 20 miles away, by Chinook helicopter. She didn\u2019t speak to the media, instead issuing a statement saying she was \u201cincredibly proud of the skill and dedication shown to tackle this challenging situation\u201d. But the challenges show no sign of going away. As more than 1,000 people have been removed from the overcrowded centre in the last few days, it has become clear that frantic attempts to clear out the site may be throwing up as many problems as they solve \u2013 and the crisis is not limited to Manston itself. Home Office officials are said to be \u201csitting refreshing booking.com\u201d for hotels, but those clicks were not quick enough for the 11 asylum seekers dumped in central London without accommodation on Tuesday; there are now reports that a dozen more spent the night at Victoria station on Wednesday (\u00a3) after being dropped off with nowhere to go. Yesterday, the Guardian reported another appalling story on the safeguarding of asylum seekers: the alleged rape of a teenage boy at a refugee hotel in east London. For today\u2019s newsletter, I spoke to Amelia Gentleman, who broke the story of the first group stranded in London, about what happened next \u2013 and what those now being moved on from Manston can expect. Here are the headlines. Five big stories  Manchester Arena attack | An inquiry into the Manchester arena terrorist attack has concluded that John Atkinson, one of the 22 people who were killed, would probably have survived had there not been \u201cinadequacies\u201d in the emergency response. Economy | The Bank of England has warned the UK risks being plunged into the longest recession in 100 years after it pushed up the cost of borrowing to 3%, the biggest single interest rate rise since 1989. Scroll down for a reading list on the rate rise. Twitter | Elon Musk will begin mass layoffs at Twitter on Friday, sharply reducing the social media platform\u2019s workforce, the company said in an email to staff on Thursday. Reports have suggested that as many as half of the company\u2019s 7,000 workers could lose their jobs. Pakistan | Former prime minister Imran Khan has been wounded in the leg after a gunman open fired at a container lorry that was carrying him. Khan was leading a protest march on Islamabad to demand a snap election. Protest | A group of pupils and parents in east London temporarily blocked the local council from removing their \u201cschool street\u201d \u2013 a road with traffic restrictions outside schools during drop-off and pick-up times. Children climbed on top of road barriers, shouting and singing as construction workers tried and failed to move them.  In depth: \u2018Nobody is really acknowledging how big the problems are\u2019  When I spoke to Amelia Gentleman yesterday, she had just finished a call with one of the Manston detainees who was left in central London without accommodation, warm clothing, or any indication about what they should do next. \u201cI think I have a clearer sense of what happened now,\u201d she said. \u201cBut some of the logic is very hard to understand.\u201d Here\u2019s what what we know about how that situation came about, and what awaits asylum seekers after they leave places like Manston. *** Initial release from detention After Amelia\u2019s initial story was published, the Home Office said that the \u201casylum seekers are only released from Manston when we have assurances that they have accommodation to go to\u201d. This is what that looked like, according to a young man from Afghanistan she spoke with: \u201cHe had been in Manston for a week and a half, in a tent with 170 people all sleeping on the floor. The roof was leaking, the shower wasn\u2019t working, the loo wasn\u2019t working. \u201cOn Saturday morning, he has an interview with an Afghan interpreter with him, asking if he has friends and family in the UK. He says, yes, he has a friend in the UK he can stay with.\u201d After that interview, Amelia said, \u201che\u2019s put on a bus to London \u2013 but while he has somewhere to stay, there\u2019s no interpreter on the bus to help check that. People are getting on at the front asking if they are being taken to a hotel, and somebody who doesn\u2019t understand them is telling them yes.\u201d Another interviewee, also from Afghanistan, told Amelia that the bus driver told them: \u201cGo anywhere you want to go, it\u2019s not my responsibility.\u201d The asylum seeker went on: \u201cI told the driver I don\u2019t have any address or any relatives. He said: \u2018I can\u2019t do anything for you.\u2019\u201d Eventually, after charity volunteers contacted the Home Office, the stranded asylum seekers were taken to a hotel in Norwich. It all sounds like a disorganised disaster. \u201cPoor record-keeping at week 163 of the small boats response is system failure,\u201d a damning report on the processing of people arriving by small boat said earlier this year. It is now week 201. *** Accommodation problems The exorbitant costs of hotel accommodation for asylum seekers who have moved on from centres like Manston \u2013 currently estimated at \u00a36.8m per day, up from \u00a34.7m in January \u2013 has generated some anger, exacerbated by stories like this one reporting that one in four of those hotels are four or five star. (The story also says asylum seekers will be denied access to facilities like pools, spas and gyms.) What that account misses is how dire living conditions are for many of those housed by the Home Office \u2013 a reality underlined yesterday by this story from Emine Sinmaz and Jessica Elgot about an alleged rape of a teenage boy and sexual assault of a child under 13 at an east London refugee hotel. While the use of hotels is increasing because of the sheer number of people waiting for asylum claims to be processed, \u201cthe majority are in hostels or Home Office-run accommodation,\u201d Amelia said. \u201cWe\u2019ve run any number of stories over the years showing how poor the conditions are in some of these places.\u201d Meanwhile, Amelia added, the Home Office has a hard time finding the accommodation in the first place. \u201cA Home Office source told me that almost every place they identify triggers complaints from local MPs, and they move on.\u201d Councils make similar complaints, as this Matthew Weaver story explains. On Tuesday, LBC reported a government source claiming that Suella Braverman refused to approve hotel bookings for those at Manston because \u201cthey were in Tory voting areas\u201d. (The Home Office denies this.) All of that may explain why, whether or not a minority of asylum seekers are staying in hotels with a swimming pool they aren\u2019t allowed to use anyway, in many other cases basic checks appear not to be carried out on accommodation. Last year, Mohammed Munib Majeedi, a five-year-old Afghan boy, fell to his death through an open window on the ninth-floor of a \u00a333 per night hotel in Sheffield. There were reports that some windows on high floors had no latches and could be opened wide from the bottom. *** Poor standard of living The group taken to London by coach were left without money, train tickets, or warm clothing. \u201cThey weren\u2019t even told where they were in the city,\u201d Amelia said. \u201cThey were given mobile phones, but with no charge or no credit. The person I spoke to had to ask a passerby to explain where he was, and borrow his phone.\u201d Even outside these extreme circumstances, provision for asylum seekers is spartan. Those in hotels, who have food provided, receive \u00a38.24 per week to buy essentials. Those living in the community and buying their own food get \u00a340 a week. They are not allowed to work, but also have \u201cno recourse to public funds\u201d, meaning they are ineligible for benefits. Charities often have to provide clothes, especially in the cold winter months. Mobile phones which are confiscated when people first arrive are sometimes never returned (and have been illegally seized in the past). *** How is this crisis resolved? \u201cThat huge backlog of cases is disastrous for the smooth running of the Home Office, but it\u2019s also disastrous for the people caught up in it,\u201d Amelia said. \u201cThey\u2019re left with this profound sense of stagnation. They find it very hard to see how they\u2019re going to rebuild their lives.\u201d With no end in sight to the crisis, Aubrey Allegretti reports that Conservative MPs are becoming restive at a growing sense that the government has failed to grip the problem. The Home Office source Amelia spoke to was not optimistic about resolving any of this soon. \u201cThey were saying that there\u2019s this very fundamental issue,\u201d she said. \u201cMinisters feel the pressure from the public, and they talk like they just want the officials to fix it. But nobody is really acknowledging how big the problems are \u2013 and that until you change the system on a deep level, all of this is going to keep happening.\u201d What to read about the UK\u2019s interest rate rise  Rupert Jones explains how the 0.75% interest rate increase will affect loans, mortgages, credit cards and savings. Polly Toynbee argues that Britain needs to spend its way out of the downturn. \u201cIt\u2019s as if John Maynard Keynes had never proved the needless damage done by cutting during a recession, causing a long depression,\u201d she writes. Larry Elliott\u2019s analysis says that the Bank of England appears unlikely to push rates higher. \u201cAlready, some members of the MPC are getting nervous about squeezing a fragile economy too hard,\u201d he says. The Guardian\u2019s editorial from Wednesday views the rate rise as a mistake: \u201cDoctors no longer believe that bleeding the sick will make them healthy. Unfortunately, economic policymakers still do.\u201d The FT\u2019s Chris Giles explains (\u00a3) that while the Bank\u2019s headline forecast is for interest rates rising further and a two-year recession, it has given more prominence than usual to an alternative scenario where rates stay constant - and usefully explains the difference between the two.

In a Commons debate, Eustice also blamed Liz Truss, international trade secretary when negotiations opened, for the fact that the UK gave too much away. (See 6.03pm.)\n\n\nRishi Sunak has defended his deputy prime minister and justice secretary, Dominic Raab, saying he does not recognise claims from multiple civil servants that he bullied staff.\n\n\nBrexit is the ultimate reason why the UK now faces a fresh round of austerity, a former interest rate-setter at the Bank of England has said.\n\n\nUpdated at 6.24pm GMT\n\n\n 6.03pm  \nUK gave away 'far too much for far too little' in free trade deal with Australia, says George Eustice, blaming Liz Truss\n\nGeorge Eustice, the former environment secretary, has told MPs that the Commons that the free trade deal with Australia \u2013 hailed by Boris Johnson\u2019s government as one of the big trade gains from Brexit \u2013 was a poor deal for the UK.\nEustice, who was an enthusiastic Brexiter and was environment secretary while the deal was being negotiated, said the UK \u201cgave away far too much for far too little in return\u201d.\nSpeaking in a Commons debate on trade deals with Australia and New Zealand, Eustice, who was sacked by Liz Truss (international trade secretary when negotiations with Australia on the deal opened), said:\n\nThe first step is to recognise that the Australia trade deal is not actually a very good deal for the UK. It wasn\u2019t for lack of trying on my part. Indeed, there were things that we achieved: a special agricultural safeguard for years 10 to 15, staged liberalisation across the first decade, the protection of British sovereignty in SPS [sanitary and phytosanitary] issues.\nIt\u2019s no surprise that many of these areas were areas negotiated either exclusively or predominantly by Defra on behalf of the UK team.\nBut it has to be said that, overall the truth of the matter is that the UK gave away far too much for far too little in return.\n\nEustice said the UK gave too many concessions to Australian farmers. He said it was not necessary for the UK to give Australia (and New Zealand, in its deal) full liberalisation for beef and sheep, and he said \u201cneither Australia nor New Zealand had anything to offer in return for such a grand concession\u201d.\nEustice blamed Truss for what went wrong. He said:\n\nThe UK went into this negotiation holding the strongest hand, holding all of the best cards, but at some point in early summer 2021, the then trade secretary [Truss] took a decision to set an arbitrary target to conclude heads of terms by the time of the G7 summit, and from that moment the UK was on the back foot repeatedly.\nIn fact, at one point the then trade secretary asked her opposite number from Australia what he would need in order to be able to conclude an agreement by G7, and of course the Australian negotiator very kindly set out the Australian terms, which then shaped eventually the deal.\n\nEustice said that, as a backbencher, he no longer felt obliged to put a \u201cpositive gloss\u201d on what was achieved. He went on:\n\nUnless we recognise the failures that the Department for International Trade made during the Australia negotiations, we won\u2019t be able to learn the lessons of future negotiations.\n\nHe also said that, if necessary, the UK should be prepared to spend a decade negotiating joining the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP). The government should never again \u201cput ourselves in such a position of setting the clock against us and shattering our own negotiating position\u201d, he said.\nAnne-Marie Trevelyan was international trade secretary when the deal was signed in December last year. At the time she said the deal was \u201cjust the start as we get on the front foot and seize the seismic opportunities that await us on the world stage\u201d.\n\n\nUpdated at 6.24pm GMT\n\n\n 5.25pm  \nSturgeon says people should be 'profoundly concerned' by reports autumn statement will raise taxes for poorest\n\nNicola Sturgeon, Scotland\u2019s first minister, has said everyone should be \u201cprofoundly concerned\u201d by suggestions that the poor will have to pay more in tax as a result of the decisions in the autumn statement being unveiled on Thursday. On a visit to a school in Glasgow, she said:\n\nI think the hints that have been given in public in the media, by the chancellor, over the weekend should make everybody profoundly concerned.\nHe\u2019s talking about everybody having to pay more taxes, at a time when those at the lowest end of the income spectrum are already really struggling. If those tax increases fall there, that is of profound concern.\n\nShe also said there was a chance looming public sector cuts would cause \u201csignificant problems\u201d for services that are \u201cstill recovering not just from Covid but from the years of austerity that followed the last financial crash\u201d.\nBut Sturgeon did welcome the news that the website dealing with the Scottish government\u2019s Scottish child payment reportedly crashed temporarily this morning.\nThe value of the payment has gone up today from \u00a320 per week to \u00a325 per week, and the number of children eligible is being increased fourfold (from around 100,000 to around 400,00). Sturgeon said she was glad there was such a \u201cmassive demand\u201d for it.\n\n\nUpdated at 5.43pm GMT\n\n\n 5.06pm  \nRees-Mogg criticised for claiming UK could not have fully supported Ukraine without Brexit\n\nSupporters of Brexit seem to be finding it increasingly hard to point to benefits that Britain is enjoying from being outside the EU \u2013 or at least significant benefits, that outweigh the clear downsides. As my colleague Anna Isaac reports, Michael Saunders, a former member of the Bank of England\u2019s monetary policy committee, has said that, because of the damage it has done to the economy, \u201cif we hadn\u2019t had Brexit, we probably wouldn\u2019t be talking about an austerity budget this week\u201d.\n\nBut Jacob Rees-Mogg, the former business secretary and leading Brexiter, claims to have discovered a new benefit of Brexit. He says that, without Brexit, the UK would not have been able to support Ukraine to the extent that it did. He made the claim in an interview with GB News last night (where he implied Ukraine might have lost, without Brexit-enabled UK support), and he has restated his claim today.\n\nIn his interview Rees-Mogg was not asked to explain his reasoning, and it is hard to follow his reasoning. Members of the EU have considerable independence in defence and foreign policy matters, and many members are just as pro-Ukraine as the UK, or more so.\nEven Boris Johnson \u2013 who is fiercely proud of his record on Ukraine, and not shy of making bogus claims about the merits of Brexit \u2013 has not tried pursuing this argument.\nChris Bryant, a Labour former Europe minister, says Rees-Mogg\u2019s claim is a \u201cstraight lie\u201d.\n\n\nUpdated at 5.21pm GMT\n\n\n 4.24pm  \n\nAngela Rayner, the deputy Labour leader, has accused Rishi Sunak of \u201ccowering\u201d behind bullies. Responding to his comments defending Dominic Raab, Rayner said in a statement:\n\nIt is anti-bullying week, but instead of holding the bullies to account this prime minister is cowering behind them. Rishi Sunak clearly knew about Dominic Raab\u2019s reputation when he reappointed him to his cabinet.\nThe prime minister\u2019s promised appointment of an ethics watchdog is now long overdue leaving his pledge to bring integrity to his government lying in tatters. Just weeks after he was installed as prime minister there is already an overflowing in-tray of fresh accusations of ministerial misconduct.\n\n\nUpdated at 4.32pm GMT\n\n\n 4.19pm  \nBraverman tells MPs she is 'not going to overplay' significance of migrants deal with France\n\nIn the Commons Suella Braverman, the home secretary, said that the UK-France small boats agreement was \u201ca step forward\u201d \u2013 but stressed that she did not want to overstate its significance. She said:\n\nI\u2019m not going to overplay this agreement. It\u2019s a very important step forward, I think it provides a very good platform from which deeper collaboration can be secured \u2026\nIs it going to solve the problem on its own? It won\u2019t, but I do encourage everybody to support the deal we have secured.\n\nBraverman was replying to a question from Natalie Elphicke, the Tory MP for Dover. Echoing her criticism of the deal earlier on Twitter (see 2.44pm), Elphicke said that it fell short of what was needed and that the small boat arrivals were having a \u201cdreadful impact on local services\u201d in Kent.\n\n\nUpdated at 4.21pm GMT\n\n\n 4.03pm  \nUK to withdraw its peacekeeping force from Mali, defence minister tells MPs\n\nIn the Commons James Heappey, the armed forces minister, has just delivered a statement saying the UK is withdrawing its peacekeeping troops from the west African state of Mali.\nAs PA Media reports, the 300-strong UK contingent with the United Nations peacekeeping mission is to end its three-year deployment early. PA says:\n\nThe move comes after President Emmanuel Macron announced in February that French-led forces fighting jihadists in the region would be relocating from Mali to Niger.\nThe decisions reflect growing concern in western capitals that the military junta in Mali has increasingly aligned itself with the notorious Russian mercenary organisation - the Wagner Group.\n\nAfter Heappey delivered his statement, Sir Lindsay Hoyle, the Speaker, complained that the news had been leaked to the Times before it was announced to MPs.\n\nUpdated at 4.17pm GMT\n\n\n 3.48pm  \n\nDuring Home Office questions a Conservative MP said asylum seekers were being housed in a hotel in his constituency previously identified as a fire risk. Luke Evans, MP for Bosworth, said:\n\nI have a hotel in Earl Shilton that has twice been identified to try and deal with the backlog but failed due to health and safety concerns, particularly around fire. I was surprised when my constituents wrote to me saying they had seen asylum seekers in this hotel.\n\nEvans said the local councils and police had not been told about the placement, and he said it took him 72 hours to get the Home Office to confirm asylum seekers were being housed in the hotel.\nSuella Braverman said that \u201clocal partners\u201d should have been informed, but that \u201cdue to the incredible pressure on the system recently\u201d sometimes that did not happen.\n\nUpdated at 3.57pm GMT\n\n\n 3.41pm  \nLabour claims Nationality and Borders Act 'adding further delays' to processing of asylum claims\n\nDuring Home Office questions in the Commons Stephen Kinnock, the shadow immigration minister, claimed a law passed by the government was contributing to the delay in processing asylum claims.\nKinnock said:\n\nThe Nationality and Borders Act establishes a new category of asylum seekers whom the government claims are not permitted to claim asylum in Britain and who should therefore be removed.\nBut, because they have failed to agree a returns agreement with France and because the Rwanda policy is completely unworkable, 16,000 people in this category have been stuck in limbo waiting an additional six months for a decision at huge cost to the British taxpayer.\nOf those 16,000 who are in limbo, only 21 have been returned since the act came into force.\nDo ministers therefore accept that their own legislation is adding further delays, cost, chaos and confusion to an already broken system, whilst doing next to nothing to remove failed asylum seekers who have no right to be here?\n\nIn response, Suella Braverman, the home secretary, said Labour was not offering any solutions. She told Kinnock:\n\nI find it staggering, frankly, that Labour seem to love complaining about the system, but when we introduce laws to fix it, what did they do? They opposed every step of the way.\nWe wanted to make it easier to deport foreign national offenders, Labour voted against it. We wanted to fix our asylum system, Labour voted against it. We secured a groundbreaking agreement with Rwanda, Labour would scrap it. Labour are very, very, very good at complaining, they have absolutely no solution at all.\n\n\nUpdated at 3.46pm GMT\n\n\n 3.33pm  \nUK announces further sanctions against Iranian officials over repression of protests\n\nThe UK, with foriegn allies, is imposing fresh sanctions on Iranian officials, in response to the repression of protests in the country, the Foreign Office has announced.\nJames Cleverly, the foreign secretary, said:\n\nThese sanctions target officials within the Iranian regime who are responsible for heinous human rights violations.\nTogether with our partners, we have sent a clear message to the Iranian regime - the violent crackdown on protests must stop and freedom of expression must be respected.\nThe Iranian people could not be clearer. It\u2019s time for the regime to stop blaming external actors and start listening to the voices of their people.\n\n\n\n\n 3.26pm  \n\nWhen Rishi Sunak met his Canadian counterpart, Justin Trudeau, at the G20 summit in Bali, the pair enjoyed drinks and snacks at the Bumbu Bali arts cafe, with Trudeau choosing a Bintang beer and teetotal Sunak ordering a mango spritz, PA Media reports. PA says:\n\nSunak asked his Canadian counterpart about his Asean visit, saying he was interested because the UK now has an Indo-Pacific tilt to its foreign policy.\nThe leaders also talked about the UK\u2019s potential accession to the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) trade pact, which would allow Britain to work more closely with Pacific rim economies.\n\n\n\nUpdated at 3.29pm GMT\n\n\n 2.57pm  \nJohnson makes rare appearance at departmental questions in Commons, campaigning to save Uxbridge police station\n\nIn House of Commons Suella Braverman, the home secretary, is taking questions, and she has just responded to a question from Boris Johnson. The former prime minister has not been a regular contributor to the Commons since he stood down, and he almost never attends departmental questions, but he intervened on the topic of policing in London. After praising the record of his own government on police recruitment, he asked Braverman if she agreed that Uxbridge police station should remain open.\nJohnson is MP for Uxbridge and South Ruislip. It is not a place he has mentioned often in the Commons in recent years, but perhaps he is less busy now than he used to be, and he may have noticed that, despite having a majority of 7,210, some recent polling implies he could lose his seat if Labour maintains its big lead.\nThis is from Mail Online\u2019s David Wilcock.\n\nIn response, Braverman praised Johnson and claimed his record on crime was better than his successor, Sadiq Khan\u2019s. But she did not say anything about the Uxbridge police station.\nUPDATE: My colleague Pippa Crerar says this is only the fourth time Johnson has mentioned Uxbridge in the Commons since he became its MP.\n\n\nUpdated at 4.31pm GMT\n\n\n 2.44pm  \nTory MP for Dover Natalie Elphicke says UK-France small boats deal 'falls short of what's needed'\n\nNatalie Elphicke, the Conservative MP for Dover, says the UK-France small boats deal announced today \u201cfalls short of what\u2019s needed\u201d.\n\n\n\nUpdated at 2.48pm GMT\n\n\n 2.39pm  \nStarmer says UK-France migrants deal 'small step in right direction', but says Tories created problem in first place\n\nKeir Starmer has described the UK-France small boats deal as \u201ca small step in the right direction\u201d. Speaking on a visit to Milton Keynes in Buckinghamshire, he said:\n\nMost people will look at this and say, look, there\u2019s more taxpayers\u2019 cash now being spent on a problem of the government\u2019s making.\nThis has been going on a very, very long time. And the home secretary has said that the asylum system is broken. She\u2019s right about that \u2013 they broke it.\nA small step in the right direction. But a much bigger challenge that the government still isn\u2019t gripping.\n\n\n\nUpdated at 2.47pm GMT\n\n\n 2.34pm  \n\nDominic Raab\u2019s allies are saying that they do not accept Simon McDonald\u2019s comments about his behaviour at the Foreign Office (see 2pm), and suggesting that some his officials deserved criticism because their work wasn\u2019t up to scratch, my colleague Pippa Crerar reports.\n\n\n\n\n 2.27pm  \nShapps says post-Brexit replacement of EU's product safety marking being delayed for two years to cut costs for business\n\nGrant Shapps, the business secretary, has announced that the government is delaying by two years the point by which companies have to stop using the EU\u2019s CE product safety marking and use the new British version, UKCA, instead.\nThe CE marking was supposed to be phased for British regulatory purposes in December this year, but Shapps says it will continue to be recognised for another two years.\nIn a statement in his department\u2019s news release, Shapps depicts the delay as a pro-growth measure \u2013 implicitly accepting that the post-Brexit move away from CE marking is imposing a cost on business. Shapps says:\n\nThe government is determined to remove barriers to businesses so they can get on with their top priorities, like providing quality customer service, enabling growth and supporting their staff.\nThis move will give businesses the breathing space and flexibility they need at this crucial time and ensure that our future system for product safety marking is fit for purpose, providing the highest standard for consumers without harming businesses.\n\n\n\n\n\n 2.02pm  \n\n\n\n\n\n 2.00pm  \nFormer Foreign Office chief says he's not surprised other officials viewed Raab as bully\n\nSimon McDonald was head of the Foreign Office when Dominic Raab was foreign secretary. In an interview for Andrew Marr\u2019s LBC show at 6pm this evening, McDonald said that Raab was a tough boss, and that he is not surprised other officials viewed him as a bully. These are from LBC\u2019s Matthew Harris.\n\n\n\n\nMcDonald was the former permanent secretary who triggered the downfall of Boris Johnson when he revealed that No 10 was not telling the truth about Johnson being aware of specific allegations about Chris Pincher. Two days later Johnson announced his resignation.\nRetired civil servants do not normally intervene in political controversies quite this bluntly, and McDonald\u2019s decision to denounce Johnson was seen as revenge for the way he was forced to retire. But it was reported that McDonald only went public after his private advice to No 10 that it needed to change its story about Pincher, because the public were being misled, was ignored.\n\nUpdated at 2.05pm GMT\n\n\n 1.26pm  \nSunak says he's confident Channel crossing numbers can be cut - but won't say when, and stresses France deal 'just a start'\n\nHere are the main points from Rishi Sunak\u2019s pooled broadcast interview with Sky\u2019s Beth Rigby.\n\nSunak said he was confident that asylum seeker number could be reduced, but refused to say it would happen next year as a result of the deal with France. Asked if he could guarantee that the number of people crossing the Channel in small boats would fall from this year\u2019s record high, more than 40,000 (see 9.45am), as a result of the deal, Sunak at first refused to answer the question. Pressed again on whether numbers would fall next year, he replied:\n\n\nI\u2019m confident that we can get the numbers down, but I also want to be honest with people that it isn\u2019t a single thing that will magically solve this. We can\u2019t do it overnight.\nPeople should be absolutely reassured that this is a top priority for me. I\u2019m gripping it and, as I\u2019ve said, in the time that I\u2019ve been prime minister, you\u2019re already starting to see some progress with this deal with the French.\nBut that\u2019s just a start. There\u2019s lots more that we need to do.\n\n\nHe declined to say that the tax rises or spending cuts in the autumn statement on Thursday would be worse because of Liz Truss\u2019s mini-budget. Asked if the government was having to make \u201charder choices\u201d because of Truss, Sunak at first stressed the impact of global factors, like Covid and the war in Ukraine. When pressed again, he replied:\n\n\nOn the steps of Downing Street I said that mistakes had been made. And part of the reason that I became prime minister was to address them and what we\u2019ve seen now is that stability has returned to the United Kingdom.\n\nKwasi Kwarteng, Truss\u2019s chancellor at the time of the mini-budget, argues that because the mistakes in the mini-budget have been mostly reversed, it can\u2019t be blamed for the public finances being in a worse state than they otherwise would have been. Jeremy Hunt, the current chancellor, has implied he does not accept this. Sunak is saying Truss made mistakes, but he seems reluctant to say that she caused long-term damage to the national finances.\n\nSunak claimed that \u201cfairness and compassion\u201d would be at the heart of the autumn statement.\n\n\nHe stressed the importance of working constructively with other countries, citing migration, and the deal with France, as an example of why they could help the UK. He said:\n\n\nWe should make our voices heard and constructively work with people where we can to make a difference for people at home as well. And you saw that recently when it comes to migration, the ability to talk to other countries can have benefits for people at home, and that\u2019s what I\u2019m here to do.\n\nSunak was explaining why it was important to attend the G20 summit, even though G20 countries do not all agree on Ukraine. (See 12.45pm.) His comment might seem like a statement of the obvious, but he does also seem keen to make the point that, after Boris Johnson and Liz Truss, the UK is now being led by someone less antagonistic towards foreigners.\n\nUpdated at 1.29pm GMT\n\n\n 12.45pm  \n\nRishi Sunak has recorded a pooled interview with Beth Rigby from Sky News. As she reports, Sunak insisted that it was right for him to attend the G20 summit even if, as a group, it does not issue a joint condemnation of Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine.\n\nRussia is a member of the G20, which is one reason why there won\u2019t be a joint communique condemning the invasion. But some other G20 members have been unwilling to criticise Vladimir Putin over Ukraine too.\n\nUpdated at 1.28pm GMT\n\n\n 12.39pm  \n\nHere are some more pictures of Rishi Sunak arriving in Bali, where he is attending the G20 summit.\n\n\n\n\n\n 12.32pm  \nNo 10 refuses to deny concern expressed about Raab's conduct towards staff when he was Brexit secretary\n\nAs my colleague Pippa Crerar reports, at the lobby briefing Downing Street also refused to deny a report in the Observer that a \u201cserious expression of concern\u201d about Dominic Raab\u2019s conduct towards staff was sent to the Cabinet Office when he was Brexit secretary.\n\n\n\n\n 12.25pm  \nNo 10 refuses to say it is confident UK-France migrants deal will bring number of small boat Channel crossings down\n\nAt the Downing Street lobby briefing the prime minister\u2019s spokesperson confirmed that there are no targets attached to the UK-France asylum deal for how it should reduce small boat Channel crossings. Echoing the stance taken by James Cleverly this morning (see 9.23am), No 10 won\u2019t even say it is confident the deal will bring numbers down. This is from Lucy Fisher from Times Radio.\n\nI will post more from the lobby briefing shortly.\n\n\n\n 12.17pm  \nSunak says he does \u2018not recognise\u2019 bullying claims against Raab\n\nRishi Sunak has defended his deputy prime minister and justice secretary, Dominic Raab, saying he does not recognise claims from multiple civil servants that he bullied staff. Speaking to journalists on his flight to Bali following my colleague Pippa Crerar\u2019s revelation on Friday night that staff in Raab\u2019s office at the MoJ were offered the chance to move because some were still traumatised by the experience of working for him when he was last there, Sunak said he did not recognise that description of Raab. He said:\n\nI don\u2019t recognise that characterisation of Dominic and I\u2019m not aware of any formal complaints about him.\nOf course, there are established procedures for civil servants if they want to bring to light any issues. I\u2019m not aware of any formal complaint about Dominic.\n\nMy colleague Jessica Elgot has the full story here.\n\n\nUpdated at 12.30pm GMT\n\n\n 12.08pm  \n\nThe SNP has also criticised the UK-France small boats deal, saying there should be \u201cmany more\u201d safe and legal routes for people seeking asylum in the UK. This is from Anne McLauglin MP, the SNP\u2019s immigration spokesperson.\n\nWhile co-operation with the French is welcome, no deal will fix the Tories disastrous asylum system. With independence, Scotland can rid ourselves of callous Tory policies and create a humane migration system that works for us.\nWe have seen deals like this before and they have failed to significantly improve the situation. The UK government must instead focus on creating more safe and legal routes, which we know work, and address the backlog of asylum decisions.\nThe whole UK asylum system needs root and branch reform to make it humane and fit for purpose, including giving asylum seekers the right to work, creating many more safe and legal routes, and providing decent accommodation and support systems for those seeking safety upon arrival.\nBut more immediately, the 10,000 asylum seekers who have been waiting for a decision for three years or more deserve an answer. These people should have already had their decision by now and could be working, paying tax and contributing to our society. The money the UK government is using to pay the French for border control would be better spent on hiring and training more Home Office staff to get through the backlog.\n\n\n\n\n 12.02pm  \nLabour dismisses UK-France deal to curb Channel migration as too little, too late\n\nLabour is dismissing the UK-France small boats deal as too little, too late. This is what Yvette Cooper, the shadow home secretary, posted about it on Twitter last night.\n\nUPDATE: Stephen Kinnock, the shadow immigration minister, delivered the same critique in an interview with Sky News this morning.\n\n\nUpdated at 12.49pm GMT\n\n\n 11.58am  \n\n\n\n\n\n 11.55am  \n\nAs my colleagues Aletha Adu, Pippa Crerar and Jessica Elgot report, senior Labour figures have said that Jeremy Corbyn will never be permitted to stand again as a candidate for the party at a general election.\n\nMomentum, the Labour group set up when Corbyn was leader to promote him and his agenda, has described this stance as \u201cdisgraceful\u201d.\n\nAs our report explains, if Corbyn ends up running for parliament as a non-Labour candidate at the next election, Momentum will not be able to support him without becoming a banned organisation within the party. Adu, Crerar and Elgot report:\n\nShould Corbyn decide to run at the next election as an independent, it would pose a potentially existential dilemma for Momentum, the grassroots leftwing group that emerged out of Corbyn\u2019s leadership campaign, which has become a pressure group for the Labour left and the loudest critic of Starmer\u2019s leadership.\nSenior Labour sources have made it clear that should Momentum campaign for Corbyn, it would be proscribed as an organisation by Labour \u2013 similar to the way Militant or other leftwing groups that challenged Labour MPs have been treated.\n\n\n\n\n 11.38am  \n\nRishi Sunak has touched down on the tropical island of Bali ahead of the G20 summit, PA Media reports. PA says:\n\nAs the prime minister stepped out of the plane and into the evening humidity, he was met by a guard of honour and a troupe of dancers on the tarmac.\nSunak looked on and smiled as the group performed a spectacular traditional Balinese dance called \u201cpendet\u201d, carrying bowls of flower petals as their gold headdresses gleamed in the airport floodlights.\nThe prime minister arrived in Bali after a long-haul flight evening, ahead of the two-day summit\u2019s kick off the next morning.\n\n\nUpdated at 11.58am GMT\n\n\n 11.26am  \n\nJames Cleverly, the foreign secretary, was criticised last month for saying that gay football fans visiting Qatar for the Word Cup should \u201cbe respectful\u201d, and make allowance for the country\u2019s intolerance of homosexuality.\nIn an interview on ITV\u2019s Good Morning Britain, Cleverly defended his comments, saying that the Foreign Office always advises people to obey local laws when they are travelling. He told the programme:\n\nMy focus is to make sure that British visitors, particularly LGBTQ+ visitors to Qatar going to enjoy the World Cup, are safe and that they enjoy their tournament. So my advice was purely about ensuring that they have a safe and secure time at the World Cup.\nWe always say that you have to respect the laws of your host nation. That is a universal element of British travel advice.\n\nAsked if gay football fans should refrain from holding hands while there, he said he wanted to ensure fans were safe. He said:\n\nI\u2019ve spoken at length with the Qatari authorities on this and it\u2019s worth bearing in mind that men and women don\u2019t typically hold hands in Qatar, and other conservative Muslim countries like Qatar, so my strong advice is to look at the UK government\u2019s travel advice.\n\n\nUpdated at 11.32am GMT\n\n\n 11.14am  \n\nAmnesty International UK has also criticised today\u2019s UK-France small boats deal, saying it just another version of a \u201cfailed response\u2019 that has not work. The charity\u2019s refugee and migrant rights director, Steve Valdez-Symonds, said: \n\nThis deal is just the same as previous deals - spending money and resources on intercepting and obstructing people crossing the Channel, while doing nothing to address their need for safe access to an asylum system.\nThe inevitable result will be more dangerous journeys and more profits led by ruthless smuggling gangs and other serious criminals exploiting the refusal of the UK and French government to take and share responsibility.\nPerpetuating this dreadful human suffering by recycling the same failed response to punish and deter desperate people in miserable and unsafe conditions has become mindless to the point of cruelty.\nUnless the UK government accepts its share of people into its asylum system, particularly people with family and connections in the UK, there seems little prospect that anything is going to change, let alone improve.\n\n\n\n\n 11.08am  \nSadiq Khan dismisses UK-France small boats deal as 'red meat' for public that does not address cause of problem\n\nSadiq Khan, the Labour mayor of London, has dismissed the UK-France small boats deal as \u201cred meat\u201d for the public that does not address cause of the problem. He told Times Radio:\n\nMy concern is what the government\u2019s doing today is sort of throwing some red meat to people who are concerned about migration and not addressing the core issue we\u2019ve had over the last 11 months, 40,000 people crossing the Channel in little boats.\nSo this tough rhetoric clearly isn\u2019t working by itself.\nYou\u2019ve got to have close relations with France, colleagues in the European Union, with countries in north Africa, you\u2019ve got to deal at source with those people who are playing on the misery of asylum seekers and refugees in relation to charging them a fortune.\n\n\nUpdated at 11.11am GMT\n\n\n 10.50am  \nCleverly claims most people trying to get to UK in small boats are economic migrants\n\nIn an article in the Sunday Telegraph yesterday Robert Jenrick, the immigration minister, said that asylum seekers should not be staying in luxury hotels. Echoing comments made by his boss, Suella Braverman, the home secretary, who recently complained about migrants being housed in four-star hotels, Jenrick said:\n\nHuman decency has to be accompanied by hard-headed common sense: illegal immigrants are not entitled to luxury hotels. Conditions in the UK are almost always better than in neighbouring countries, which helps explain why the UK is a destination of choice for economic migrants on the continent \u201casylum shopping\u201d. \n\u201cHotel Britain\u201d must end, and be replaced with simple, functional accommodation that does not create an additional pull factor.\n\nIn an interview this morning James Cleverly, the foreign secretary, defended Jenrick\u2019s comments, saying it was important to reduce the \u201cpull factor\u201d that made the UK attractive to economic migrants. He also claimed that most people trying to get to the UK were economic migrants. He told BBC Breakfast:\n\nMany of the people, the bulk of people attempting to get to the UK, are economic migrants rather than fleeing persecution or war. They are seeking a better life. I get that, I understand that, the UK is a wonderful place to live.\nBut it is because they perceive the UK to be a very generous country, that is part of the pull factor.\n\nRecent Home Office figures undermine claims that most of those crossing the Channel in small boats are economic migrants, rather than people with a genuine reason to seek asylum. Of the asylum cases that were decided in the year ending in June 2022, 76% initial decisions resulted in asylum, or an alternative form of leave to remain, being granted. That is the highest figure since 1990, when 82% of initial applications were granted. \n\n\n\n 10.27am  \nFifth of hospitality firms have cut trading hours to save energy costs, ONS says\n\nOver a fifth of hospitality firms have cut their hours over the past three months in a bid to cut energy costs, the Office for National Statistics has revealed.\nThe ONS has released a report saying food and drink service firms, such as pubs, restaurants and bars, are more likely than firms in any other sector to cut trading to deal with mammoth increases in energy bills.\nIt says 21% of firms in the sector have cut their trading hours as a result, even if they are still operating for the same number of days.\nMeanwhile, 6% of businesses in the sector say they have cut trading by two or more days a week over the past three months.\n\n\nUpdated at 10.35am GMT\n\n\n 9.50am  \n\nSuella Braverman has been tweeting about the new small boats deal with the French.\n\n\nAnd these are from her French opposite number, G\u00e9rald Darminin.\n\n\n\n\n\n 9.45am  \n\nSome 853 people were detected crossing the English Channel in small boats on Sunday, the Ministry of Defence said. It follows 972 crossings on Saturday.\nAs PA Media reports, the cumulative number of crossings this year now stands at a provisional total of 41,738. \nTotal crossings last year were 28,526.\nThere were 26 boats detected on Sunday, which suggests an average of around 33 people crossed the Channel per boat.\n\nUpdated at 10.18am GMT\n\n\n 9.43am  \n\nLucy Moreton, an official with the ISU, the union for borders, immigration and customs staff, told Times Radio the new UK-France deal on asylum seekers would not address the core problem.\nShe said that interrupting migrants to \u201cjust let them go to try again\u201d would not have the required impact and nothing in the deal suggested that \u201cthe French are going to move away from that position\u201d. She went on:\n\nThe sticking points just simply have not been addressed.\n\nAs PA Media reports, the ISU professional officer added that intercepting migrants so they do not try to get to the UK again was not something the French \u201chave ever wanted to do\u201d, as from the French perspective \u201cthey are going the right way and it\u2019s entirely understandable that they are not very keen to interrupt that\u201d.\nShe said the UK needed to deal with the issue itself by resourcing \u201cthe court system far better than it has been\u201d in order to process claims in a shorter space of time.\nAs my colleague Rajeev Syal reports, more than 40,000 people seeking asylum in the UK have waited between one and three years for a decision on their claim, new figures show.\n\n\nUpdated at 9.55am GMT\n\n\n 9.31am  \n\nSuella Braverman, the home secretary, has signed the new UK-France agreement on Channel crossings with her French counterpart, G\u00e9rald Darmanin, this morning. She said that it wasn\u2019t a quick fix, but that it would lead to a significant increase in the number of French officers patrolling beaches. She said:\n\nWe must do everything we can to stop people making these dangerous journeys and crack down on the criminal gangs.\nThis is a global challenge requiring global solutions, and it is in the interests of both the UK and French governments to work together to solve this complex problem.\nThere are no quick fixes but this new arrangement will mean we can significantly increase the number of French gendarmes patrolling the beaches in northern France and ensure UK and French officers are working hand in hand to stop the people smugglers.\n\n\n\n\n\n 9.23am  \nJames Cleverly refuses to say how UK-France deal on asylum seekers will affect numbers crossing Channel\n\nRishi Sunak will be arriving in Bali later for the G20 summit, but he has been speaking to the journalists travelling with him on his plane about a deal announced this morning with France, to increase cooperation on tackling people using small boats to cross the Channel. Here is our story, by my colleagues Jessica Elgot (who is with Sunak) and Peter Walker.\n\nSunak told reporters there was no \u201csingle thing\u201d that would solve the small boats problem, but he said he was \u201cconfident we can bring the numbers down over time\u201d.\nBut the government won\u2019t say what difference it expects the deal with the French announced today to make. James Cleverly, the foreign secretary, has been giving interviews this morning and he has been dodging questions on this point. On the Today programme he said that cooperation with the French was already making a difference and that 29,000 people had been stopped from getting to the UK this year \u2013 almost twice as many as in previous years. But when Today\u2019s Mishal Husain asked him what impact the new agreement was likely to have on the number of crossings (\u201cI\u2019m sure that you have a way of measuring that,\u201d she said, optimistically), Cleverly declined to give a figure. He replied:\n\nIt\u2019s really important you understand that we are we are dealing with an evolving situation \u2026 It\u2019s very, very difficult to predict exact numbers. It depends on so many variables, but the important thing is that we are working more closely [with the French] \u2026. more French officers on the beaches as a direct result of the agreement that the home secretary and the French interior minister have signed today.\n\n\nI will post more from his interviews shortly.\nHere is the agenda for the day.\n11.30am: Downing Street holds a lobby briefing.\n12.45pm: Michael Gove, the levelling up secretary, gives the keynote speech at the Centre for Policy Studies Margaret Thatcher Conference on Growth.\n2.30pm: Home Office questions in the Commons.\n4pm: James Cleverly, the foreign secretary, gives evidence to the Commons foreign affairs committee.\ntry to monitor the comments below the line (BTL) but it is impossible to read them all. If you have a direct question, do include \u201cAndrew\u201d in it somewhere and I\u2019m more likely to find it. I do try to answer questions and, if they are of general interest, I will post the question and reply above the line (ATL), although I can\u2019t promise to do this for everyone.\nIf you want to attract my attention quickly, it is probably better to use Twitter. I\u2019m on @AndrewSparrow.\nAlternatively, you can email me at andrew.sparrow@theguardian.com\n\n\nUpdated at 11.43am GMT\n"

The two best teams, the No.1 ranked team against the defending champion in a humdinger. England went down fighting thanks to Sciver\u2019s 148, but ultimately Healy, with support from Haynes and Mooney took the title out of reach. Australia - you bloody beauty.\nThanks to all of you for tuning in, and getting in touch, during what has been a thoroughly enjoyable tournament at beautiful grounds on fine pitches. That\u2019s it from us for now - the match report will be here shortly. Congratulations/commisserations to all.\n\n\nUpdated at 10.34am BST\n\n\n 9.31am  \n\nTime for Australia to collect their medals, florescent yellow pyjamas and huge smiles.\n\u201cI think we\u2019ve been extremely consistent over a long period of time,\u201d says Lanning, \u201cand to come out and peform so well over the whole tournament was great. We knew we had to have a number of different people perform, and we did, young players keeping more experienced players on their toes. Alyssa was incredible, I\u2019m probably not surprised to be honest, she\u2019s done it before. Nat Sciver is an incredible player, a special innings which in any other day could have been a match winning one. What next? We\u2019ll celebrate this one first, its really important to look back at this period and how successful it\u2019s been, it hadn\u2019t been easy, they\u2019ve been ups and downs in this thing.\u201d\nShe thanks England and then, with a lump in her throat, thanks the support staff and the team, before rejoining the team and lifting the trophy with a huge smile. The fireworks go off and Men at Work is played over the sound system.\n\n\nUpdated at 9.48am BST\n\n\n 9.23am  \n\nEngland collect their World Cup medals, Beaumont is wearing shorts and Sciver is walking with a limp.\n\u201cI think it was a fifty fifty decision at the toss,\u201d says Knight, \u201ccredit to Australia, that was a remarkable innings, not really a pleasure to watch but outstanding. Unbelievable from Nat, skill against spin, against seam, just a shame we didn\u2019t have anyone who could stick with her. I\u2019m super proud of the group how we managed to turn things around,t he players and the staff as well, but unfortunately it was one win too many for us. Special mention to Sophie Ecclestone, leading wicket-taker, watching those young players perform gives me a great deal of pleasure.\u201d\nWhat a star she is.\n\n\n\n 9.19am  \n\nWe were lucky enough to watch two supreme centuries today from Nat Sciver and Alyssa Healy. Both batters have been in wonderful form during the tournament. Sciver scooping her way to 148 not out in a losing cause and Alyssa Healy\u2019s scintillating 170, the highest ever score in a World Cup final, which took Australia up, away and into the stratosphere. She is, of course, player of the match and player of the tournament award as well. Not a bad month\u2019s work.\n\u201cI don\u2019t really think I should get this award,\u201d she tells Mel Jones, \u201cI only really turned up for the last two games, Rach did most of the work.\u201d\n\nUpdated at 9.34am BST\n\n\n 9.10am  \n\nA thoroughly deserved win for Australia. They\u2019re just an awesome team, fearless, supremely confident in their skills, almost flawless in the field. Well led, bold and disciplined, with a hand of all-time greats. They\u2019re heads and shoulders above all the other teams - unbeaten in the tournament - that\u2019s what professionalism does I guess. \n\n\n\n\n 9.05am  \n\nAlyssa Healy, she of the highest World Cup score ever, is talking, smeared with suncream and grinning. \u201cIt\u2019s not sunk in yet. It was a special game of cricket, very high scoring. It is something we have been working towards for a long period of time. To get over the line was pretty cool. The job was half done, we knew we had a good total. But we knew their lineup was peaking at the right time. The bowlers held their nerves. Sciver played a special knock, almost got them over the line. It was nice to get out there and put up a good total on board. Proud of the batting group and whole group. I think everyone has worked very hard for this. It has been a five-year wait for a title people said we would have had. Will reflect on the three months that we have had.\u201d\n\n\n\n 9.00am  \n\nThe teams shake hands as Australia celebrate. The England team line up to hug Sciver and Shrubsole too - Sciver is proudly resigned, Shrubsole shedding a tear. We get a close up of Lanning taking that last catch - the woman is made of steel, such a look of utter determination. And a hint of a smile.\n\n\n\nUpdated at 9.17am BST\n\n\n 8.57am  \nAustralia win the World Cup by 71 runs!\n\nWICKET! Shrubsole c Lanning b Jonassen 1 A step too far for Shrubsole as she dances down the pitch, plonks the ball in the air and Lanning running backwards takes a fine catch at mid-off.

No boundary. \n\n\n\n 8.44am  \n\n41st over: England 269-8 (Sciver 137, Dean 17) Gardener bowls her first over at a time of high pressure.

The current run rate is 6.56, the required run rate 9.18. The crowd aren\u2019t going anywhere, but the blankets are out and, I\u2019ve got to admit, they look cold. \n\n\n\n 8.35am  \n\n38th over: England 242-8 (Sciver 121, Dean 11) Through the glass darkly the camera shows Anya Shrubsole, arms folded, crouched over a desk. King finishes her spell (3-64) but not before Sciver somehow survives one that skims past leg stump. England need 110 from 72 balls - it\u2019s possible folks!\n\n\n\n 8.31am  \n\n37th over: England 242-8 (Sciver 117, Dean 10) McGrath leaking runs. A brilliant bit of fielding from Perry (who has been outstanding in the field today) stops the boundary from Sciver but she takes another from a scoop that is in nodding distance with the bails.\n\n\n\n 8.28am  \n\n36th over: England 233-8 (Sciver 109, Dean 9) Now that\u2019s gorgeous - Sciver dances down and kettles the ball between mid-wicket and mid-on for four. And there\u2019s another, this time from Dean, who punches Jonassen through the covers. Sciver has now got the fifth highest score in any cricket World Cup final. (Healy is of course top).\n\nUpdated at 8.28am BST\n\n\n 8.24am  \nNat Sciver makes her second World Cup hundred against Australia!\n\n35th over: England 223-8 (Sciver 104, Dean 4) A fumble on the boundary allows Sciver to come back for the second and that\u2019s a fantastic hundred, brave and bold.

Though Brunt is playing in her third World Cup final, I shouldn\u2019t be doubting her. \n\n\n\n 7.54am  \n\n28th over: England 179-5 (Sciver 71 , Brunt 0) Ah for shame. England down to the batters now as the paddle sweep causes Dunkley\u2019s downfall again. \n\n\n\n 7.53am  \nWICKET! Dunkley b King 22 (England 179-5)\n\n Round her legs! Exactly the same as Hamilton as the ball fizzes from outside leg stump to ping back leg stump. \n\n\nUpdated at 8.14am BST\n\n\n 7.50am  \n\n26th over: England 176-4 (Sciver 70 , Dunkley 21) It\u2019s cat and mouse at the moment, England going for the big shots, but hitting the Australian outfielders. I take that back, Dunkley leans back and cuts Schutt\u2019s last ball for four, high and over the leaping point.\n\n\n\n 7.46am  \n\n25th over: England 169-4 (Sciver 68 , Dunkley 15) England eye up King, big hitting but they can\u2019t reach the boundary. And the sky around the Oval turns burnt orange in the most beautiful sunset. \nIt\u2019s Ed Kay again:\n\u201cHow are you bearing up? I doubt you\u2019ll need too much coffee this morning with the adrenaline England are giving us with this chase! It\u2019s a tough watch! Every time we start to score freely the Aussies pull out another wicket.My heart veers between \u201cthis is going to be the most incredible run chase, in the most exciting final, of all time!\u201d to \u201cwe\u2019ll be all out for 200\u201d and at four down I have to say that my head is with the latter. But while Sciver and Dunkley are at the crease there\u2019s still hope!\u201d\nSo true. I feel like its impossible really, but England are going about it just the right way so - hope lives. \n\n\n\n 7.42am  \n\n25th over: England 163-4 (Sciver 65 , Dunkley 12) Dunkley is dropped! By Lanning at cover. A hard chance but you\u2019d expect Lanning to hold on as she throws herself in the air. Next ball, to rub salt in the wound, Sciver pulls Jonassen for four. Four more singles and England march boldly on. \n\nUpdated at 7.43am BST\n\n\n 7.38am  \n\n24th over: England 154-4 (Sciver 59 , Dunkley 10)Dunkley down on one knee and almost pulls the ball onto the stumps. Then Sciver, up and over, says Nasser, and it is. Four more!\n\n\n\n 7.36am  \n\n23rd over: England 144-4 (Sciver 53 , Dunkley 6) \nHi Tanya,\u201cThanks for these updates, no Sky for me so it\u2019s good to keep abreast of how England are doing in the final.My question is whether the Guardian can put a scorecard up along with the updates. It would give me a better idea of where we are in the game. They normally do hence me sending this one out\u201d\nAh scorecard - yes. Apologies Harold. I\u2019ll try and find someone to sort it in the office.. But you do know you can follow it on free to air via Sky\u2019s youtube channel or free to air channels showcase and pick.\n\n\n\n 7.32am  \nFifty for Sciver!\n\n22nd over: England 139-4 (Sciver 50 , Dunkley 4) Sciver reaches fifty with a single and I\u2019ve temporarily lost TV coverage, apologies.\n\n\n\n 7.28am  \n\n21st over: England 131-4 (Sciver 47 , Dunkley 1) This is England\u2019s last recognised pair of batters. No pressure.\n\nUpdated at 7.28am BST\n\n\n 7.25am  \nWICKET! Jones c King b Jonassen 20 (England 129-4)\n\nJones dances down to Jonassen but can only send it up to scrape the moon, and as it falls back to earth King, peddling backwards, takes it with both hands. She punches the air in delight.\n\n\nUpdated at 7.54am BST\n\n\n 7.22am  \n\n20th over: England 127-3 (Sciver 45 , Jones 19) Sciver has her eye on Brown - smashing her for two consecutive fours, all twinkling feet and flashing blade. She and Jones grin at each other - nothing like being an underdog in a challenge. Thirteen from the over.And ridiculously, England are pulling away from Australia in the required run rate. \n\nUpdated at 7.27am BST\n\n\n 7.18am  \n\n19th over: England 112-3 (Sciver 35 , Jones 13) The sun is starting to set on the beautiful Hagley Oval and England are keeping chipper, hustling singles off Jonassen and then Jones crashes four through midwicket. \n\n\n\n 7.14am  \n\n18th over: England 105-3 (Sciver 34 , Jones 9) Sciver scoops to conquer and away McGrath is sent, flying down to the boundary. England tip and run more, and they\u2019re on this. If only there wasn\u2019t such a mountain to climb.\n\u201cGood afternoon Tanya (well good morning in your time)\u201c Hello Christine Mulhearn.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a cold and dreary day in Canberra and it looks infinitely better weather in New Zealand \u2013 which is not really how this usually works!\nI am at work preparing for a big week ahead finding it very distracting whilst reading the blog and listening on the radio\nAlyssa Healy\u2019s innings was just magnificent and whilst it has done amazing things for Australia, I fear it means a couple more hours in the office as I haven\u2019t been working that hard\u2026.\nPerhaps the Aussies can bowl England out quickly and I can get back to concentrating on work (well that\u2019s my excuse for wanting a quick win anyway)\u201c\n\n\n\n 7.10am  \n\n17th over: England 98-3 (Sciver 28 , Jones 8) A handsome stroke from Jones, who flicks King off her ankle straps for four, her first boundary. England being brave here, not letting themselves be cowed by losing big wickets.\n\n\n\n 7.08am  \n\n16th over: England 90-3 (Sciver 26 , Jones 2) England regroup, but still take four from McGrath\u2019s over, tall, brown pony tail bouncing along the back of her neck as she bounds in. The required run rate moves towards 8 an over.\n\nLovely to hear from you Chris!\n\nUpdated at 7.08am BST\n\n\n 7.02am  \n\n15th over: England 86-3 (Sciver 24 , Jones 0) And with that England\u2019s hopes sink a little further below the horizon. Love Knight though, she has such dignity, even in trudging off. \n\n\nUpdated at 7.58am BST\n\n\n 7.01am  \nWICKET! Knight lbw King 26 (England 86-3)\n\n She turns on her heel and marches off. A lovely ball from King, skids on, squares Knight up and hits her on the pad at calf level. \n\n\n\n 6.58am  \nNOT OUT!\n\nBy a whisker!\n\n\n\n 6.58am  \nREVIEW! Sciver lbw King\n\n Sciver wrinkles her nose - shall we review? Knight gives the nod\n\n\n\n 6.55am  \n\n14th over: England 84--2 (Sciver 23 , Knight 25) A bottom-handed swipe off for four by Sciver through the onside for four off McGrath, then she rocks back to a short ball and pulls her for four more. England currently motoring, but the road is long.\n\n\n\n 6.53am  \n\n13th over: England 76--2 (Sciver 15 , Knight 25) Some sharp running by England who are hyper alert. Sciver has a narrow escape as she gets an inside edge from King onto her pads.\n\n\n\n 6.51am  \n\n12th over: England 71--2 (Sciver 11 , Knight 24) A change both ends as Tahlia McGrath takes over, four sharp singles.\nAfter 12 overs, Australia were 49-0, but Healy was yet to really get going. \n\n\n\n 6.48am  \n\n11th over: England 67--2 (Sciver 9 , Knight 22) Wham, bam, thank you ma\u2019am! Sciver charges into a Alana King long hop and sends it flying over deep midwicket for six, and England share a good belly laugh. \n\nUpdated at 6.49am BST\n\n\n 6.44am  \n\n10th over: England 59--2 (Sciver 2 , Knight 21) To make me look a fool, back to back boundaries from Heather Knight off Brown, twice clipped off her ankles to the rope. Then a third, through the covers perfection.\n We spot Lisa Keightley on the boundary with her ever-present notebook. Is she noting down that at the end of the power play England are ahead?\n\u201cMorning Tanya!\u201d Hello there Martin Wright.\n\u201cJust in case Andrew Pearson (5th over), has made you too jealous, let me balance that by telling you that I\u2019m on a very early train to Luton, en route to Inverness. Hope that helps.\n And facing down 356, hope is all we have left, really\u2026\u201d\n Oh, the glamour!\n\n\n\n 6.38am  \n\n9th over: England 46--2 (Sciver 2 , Knight 9)  I\u2019ll be charitable and saying England are playing themselves in. Alternatively, Schutt is rather unplayable, still finding gorgeous inswing. \n\n\nUpdated at 7.56am BST\n\n\n 6.37am  \n\n8th over: England 44--2 (Sciver 0 , Knight 9) Knight leans into Brown\u2019s first ball beautifully and sends it skidding straight for four, but Brown is getting gorgeous shape.\n\u201cHi Tanya,\u201d Hello Penelope Cottier\n\u201cMuch as I love the blog, it\u2019s a disgrace that this isn\u2019t on free to air TV here in Australia, where many major matches are still shown in that way. I\u2019d love to have watched Healy\u2019s fantastic 170.Go Australia! (Not that they need the superfluous encouragement.)\u201c\nI had no idea it wasn\u2019t on free to air telly Australia - I\u2019m really surprised. Has there been an outcry? Was brilliant of Sky to do it in the UK. \n\n\n\n 6.33am  \n\n7th over: England 38--2 (Sciver 0 , Knight 4) Beaumont had just disdainfully driven Schutt down the ground for four, before Schutt sent down that beauty to trap Beaumont in front of her stumps. England need these two to knuckle down now, they can\u2019t lose another quick wicket.\n\nUpdated at 6.33am BST\n\n\n 6.31am  \nNOT OUT!\n\nHit her plumply on the pad, but missing the stumps\n\n\n\n 6.30am  \nREVIEW: Sciver lbw Schutt\n\n \n\n\n\n 6.28am  \nWICKET! Beaumont lbw Schutt 27 (England 38-2)\n\nSchutt again, swings in and hits Beaumont, with crossed legs on the knee roll. Beaumont wants a review, asks Knight for a review, pleads for a review.. but the captain sends her on her way.\n\n\nUpdated at 8.16am BST\n\n\n 6.25am  \n\n6th over: England 34--1 (Beaumont 23 , Knight 4) Brown struggling with her length against Beaumont, and her first ball is dispatched again - pat-a-cake boundary. A handful more singles and England a motoring at six an over - only just short of the required rate.\n\n\n\n 6.23am  \n\n5th over: England 27-1 (Beaumont 18 , Knight 3) Scutt pares it back, fuller, and England can only squeeze a couple from the over. \nAndrew Pearson sends me some lovely pictures from Christchurch which the computer won\u2019t let me attach.\n\u201cKia ora from two Brits in Hagley Oval!England have a mountain to climb thanks to some fantastic batting from the Australians, but the sun is shining, the gin is flowing, and the cricket is glorious! Come on England!!!\u201d\nI\u2019ve got to admit I\u2019m jealous.\n\n\n\n 6.19am  \n\n4th over: England 25-1 (Beaumont 17 , Knight 2) Brown finishes her over with a lbw appeal against Beaumont, but the ump doesn\u2019t fancy it and neither does Lanning. Beaumont is bristling, pulling Brown\u2019s first ball hrough midwicket to the rope with panache. \nAn email arrives from the frozen north. Good morning Sara Torvalds!\n\u201cGood morning from chilly Karis, Finland. It\u2019s -4 degrees and sunny here, but at least Anya Shrubsole\u2019s late wickets mean England are not chasing 400. Still, nobody said winning the World Cup should be easy!\u201d \n\n\nUpdated at 8.16am BST\n\n\n 6.15am  \n\n3rd over: England 19-1 (Beaumont 12 , Knight) 1) Beaumont is overheard saying she\u2019ll bat on off stump to overcome Schutt\u2019s inswing. And that\u2019s why - a similar ball to the one that dismissed Wyatt is whipped through midwicket for four. Wyatt looked miserable as she trudged off, pulling off her helmet in frustration.\n\n\n\n 6.10am  \nWICKET! Wyatt b Schutt 4 (England 12-1)\n\nUnbelievable inswinger from Schutt, hoops in and squeezes past the bat and pianos leg stump. \n\n\n\nUpdated at 9.28am BST\n\n\n 6.08am  \n\n2nd over: England 12-0 (Beaumont 7, Wyatt 4) Beaumont living dangerously, top-edging Brown over the wicket-keeper\u2019s head for four; edging a sneeze short of a diving Lanning at slip and then comes within an inch or chopping on. \n\n\n\n 6.05am  \n\n1st over: England 6-0 (Beaumont 1, Wyatt 4) The new ball goes to Schutt, whose up and running with a bunny hop. She strays wide and Wyatt chops her over point for England\u2019s first boundary, before playing and missing at the next. \n\u201cMorning Tanya\u201d Lovely to hear from you Ed Kay.\n\u201cWell, it\u2019s enough to make you want to go straight back to bed Anything\u2019s possible, of course, and looks like a good batting track, but if we\u2019re honest Australia will be worthy winners and have finished off with a bang.At this point I just hope we put in a good showing - and at least make it past Healy\u2019s total of 170!\u201d\nBaby steps!\n\n\n\n 6.00am  \nEngland need 357 to win at 7.14 an over\n\nOut come Beaumont and Wyatt, the evening sun dappling their light blue tops. It\u2019s hustle or bust. Here we go - 357 to retain the World Cup.\n\n\n\n 5.57am  \n\nI haven\u2019t had time to read this, but putting it in my pocket for later\n\nIf you\u2019re in sunny Christchurch, or (cloudy) Sydney, or just waking up on chilly English morning - do say hi: tanya.aldred.freelance@theguardian.com\n\n\n\n 5.54am  \n\nKudos to New Zealand cricket, it looks like a fabulous atmosphere in Christchurch, about 10,000 people sunning themselves inside the ground. Healy\u2019s hundred getting suitable props on twitter from the big guns:\n\n\nI was making a cup of tea when she was out, and on the radio they mentioned that not only did every member of the England side congratulate her, but every person in the ground stood and applauded. \n\n\n\n\n 5.46am  \n\nThanks Megan, fabulous stuff. I\u2019m just watching a medley of dropped catches by England, followed by the highlights of Alyssa Healy\u2019s pyrotechnics - not exactly Heather Knight\u2019s game plan when England walked out this morning. Still, it looks like a beautiful day in Christchurch and, well, who doesn\u2019t like a challenge?\n\n\n\n 5.38am  \nAustralia 356-5\n\nWell if you\u2019re just waking up in England, I don\u2019t have great news for you. This has been pure domination from Australia. Some late wickets from England stemmed the flow of runs the tiniest little bit, but they have an absolutely huge chase on their hands. As I said earlier, maybe this is just a really good batting wicket and they\u2019re in with a good shot here? That\u2019s the best I can do for you in terms of providing some hope right now.\nThe story of the innings was of course Alyssa Healy. An absolutely sensational 170 from 138 was the key to Australia\u2019s dominance and she looked so mature and composed out there. There were no early rash shots, she eased her way into the game, building her strike rate as she went on. It was beautiful to watch, though perhaps quite painful if you\u2019re English. Mooney and Haynes were incredible in support and Perry came through at the end to ice the cake in the most elegant way imaginable. The batters have played their role and set the stage for their bowlers to bowl at a team that has to take risks if they want to come close to this total. \nI\u2019m going to leave you here in the very capable hands of my excellent colleague Tanya Aldred, who will guide you through the England batting innings. Thank you for your company throughout this and I hope you enjoyed watching Alyssa Healy exert her dominance on this match as much as I did. I\u2019ll be settling in to watch the rest of this match with great delight. \n\n\n\n 5.30am  \n\n50th over: Australia 356-5 (Tahlia McGrath 8, Ellyse Perry 17)\nShrubsole bowls the last over and McGrath chips it over the infield for a single to start. Perry shows no sign of injury as she pushes through for two from the second ball and then cuts one that almost finds the boundary. Next ball she does find the rope and brings up the 350 for Australia, what a batting display it has been today. Just completely clinical in its dominance. Perry is so elegant at the crease and is playing the \u2018icing on the cake\u2019 role to perfection here. There\u2019s a run out attempt on the last ball of the over, but Perry is safe and they finish a sensational innings here.\n\n\n\n 5.25am  \n\n49th over: Australia 341-5 (Tahlia McGrath 7, Ellyse Perry 3)\nEcclestone bowls the penultimate over - her 10th for the day. She took that wicket earlier, but she has been expensive since then and certainly hasn\u2019t looked like the same bowler who took down SA only a few days ago. McGrath finds her first boundary with a cut shot that pierces through the field and runs quickly along the ground. \n\n\n\n 5.22am  \n\n48th over: Australia 333-5 (Tahlia McGrath 1, Ellyse Perry 1)\nThe run rate has gone past seven now and Shrubsole has had quite enough of this nonsense and takes two wickets in two balls. McGrath plays the hat trick ball safely for a single and Perry takes strike for the first time. She doesn\u2019t want a run first ball, but McGrath tries to push her for one. Perry sends her back and McGrath is nearly run out, but she gets back in her ground. Perry finishes with a single to get off the mark.\n\n\n\n 5.20am  \nWICKET! Mooney 62 c Sciver b Shrubsole, Australia 331-5\n\nTwo wickets in two balls as Shrubsole catches Mooney\u2019s edge and Sciver picks up an easy catch in the outfield.\n\n\n\n 5.19am  \nWICKET! Lanning 10 c Beaumont b Shrubsole, Australia 331-4\n\nLanning knows she has to be selfless and keep pushing hard, so she goes after one from Shrubsole and skies it. Beaumont sits underneath it and her safe hands see Lanning off in her 100th ODI.\n\n\nUpdated at 9.31am BST\n\n\n 5.16am  \n\n47th over: Australia 330-3 (Meg Lanning 10, Beth Mooney 61)\nFinally we get Lanning in with just three overs remaining and she gives Mooney the strike straight away. Brunt is bowling her final over for the day and she would dearly love to make it her best one and pick up a wicket or two. The wickets have done the trick in slowing down the run rate a little, but can England slow it enough to give themselves a chance with the bat? Lanning finds her first boundary with a pull shot past fine leg, then finds it again with a cut shot.\n\n\n\n 5.12am  \n\n46th over: Australia 318-3 (Meg Lanning 0, Beth Mooney 57)\nWell it wasn\u2019t that long ago we were talking about England trying to keep Australia under 300, but Healy and Mooney blew that possibility out of the water so quickly it was almost ridiculous. Finally England get Healy, but it doesn\u2019t provide much respite with Gardner coming in with licence to go as hard as she likes. She gets off strike, but then Mooney pushes for two and Gardner is short of her ground.\n\n\n\n 5.11am  \nWICKET! Gardner 1 ro Cross, Australia 318-3\n\nMooney pushes Gardner for two and it doesn\u2019t pay off, Cross gets the ball in quickly and Gardner has to go.\n\n\n\n 5.09am  \nWICKET! Healy 170 st Jones b Shrubsole, Australia 316-2\n\nFinally this brilliant innings from Healy comes to an end, with the quick hands of Jones finding the stumps as Healy was dancing down the wicket in search of more runs. She has been nothing short of sensational and will be delighted with that performance.\n\n\n\nUpdated at 8.19am BST\n\n\n 5.06am  \n\n45th over: Australia 315-1 (Alyssa Healy 170, Beth Mooney 57)\nAnother over from Cross and what a surprise - Healy backs away and drives a ball past deep cover for four. They simply cannot find an answer to stop her doing that. With that trademark shot, she brings up 500 runs for the tournament. She follows it up with a scoop for another four and I can almost see the double century in her eyes. Mooney catches some extra bounce, but swats the ball away behind her. Healy pops one right up in the air, but not even a badly timed shot can stop her today and there are no fielders anywhere near it. Cross then bowls a wide that evades Jones and goes to the boundary, the misery is just piling up for England at the moment. Another wide next ball adds to the frustration and the Australians just take a single from the last ball.\n\n\n\n 5.00am  \n\n44th over: Australia 297-1 (Alyssa Healy 160, Beth Mooney 55)\nBack comes Ecclestone and some sloppy fielding from England gives away overthrows on the first ball on the over. Next ball Healy brings up her 150 driving past deep cover for four, the edges one that also finds a gap and the rope. Because she\u2019s on a bit of a roll she decides she\u2019ll go for another four next ball and then mixes things up with a straight drive for just a single. Mooney gets in on the action with a lovely cut shot for four and the run rate is tiptoeing its way towards seven an over now.\n\n\n\n 4.55am  \n\n43rd over: Australia 278-1 (Alyssa Healy 145, Beth Mooney 51)\nEngland seem to have no answers for Healy backing away. She\u2019s offering up her stumps, but she loves it when they bowl in that zone and she makes no mistake in getting it into the middle of her bat every time. Healy goes a bit rogue with a scoop that almost finds Beaumont in the field, but sails past her and over the rope for four. It\u2019s all too easy for Healy, she is looking sensational today. Mooney brings up her 50 with a well-timed four on the final ball of the over.\n\n\n\n 4.51am  \n\n42nd over: Australia 260-1 (Alyssa Healy 132, Beth Mooney 46)\nThe game\u2019s only wicket taker so far - Ecclestone - comes back into the attack and the run rate is sitting at just a touch below six to start the over. Mooney takes her feet to the ball to send it soaring past that and bringing up the 250 for Australia. It\u2019s been a seriously dominant display of batting. Mooney takes back-to-back fours and she is looking very dangerous today. Australia\u2019s hustle is just so good, the way they push for two has been notable all tournament and it\u2019s no different today when they\u2019re easily on top and don\u2019t necessarily need to go that hard. On the last ball of the over, Australia brings up their hundred partnership and goes past the highest score in a World Cup final with one single.\n\n\n\n 4.46am  \n\n41st over: Australia 245-1 (Alyssa Healy 131, Beth Mooney 33)\nInto the final 10 overs now and the big question is - how many runs will Australia be able to put on here? Or, what can England restrict them to? They\u2019ll be happy to keep it under 300 at this stage. Brunt is bowling this over and her line early is better than it was in her previous over. Healy plays a lovely sweep shot, but Brunt is bowling to her field much better and it doesn\u2019t find the boundary. But it doesn\u2019t take long before Healy makes some room for herself and smacks Brunt for four. Healy is now approaching Meg Lanning\u2019s highest score of the tournament and she is in some kind of form today. Brunt is very unhappy - this has been a long day in the field for England.\n\n\nUpdated at 5.09am BST\n\n\n 4.41am  \n\n40th over: Australia 236-1 (Alyssa Healy 125, Beth Mooney 30)\nCross bowls this one for England and Healy and Mooney just keep pushing on and rotating the strike. They\u2019re looking supremely confident and Healy is offering up her stumps almost every ball. Eventually they find a sliver of an opportunity through a stumping - it\u2019s great keeping from Amy Jones, but Healy has managed to get her foot back in time and they can\u2019t say goodbye to her just yet. It\u2019s a good over from Cross, all things considered.\n\n\n\n 4.36am  \n\n39th over: Australia 233-1 (Alyssa Healy 123, Beth Mooney 29)\nWhile it\u2019s true things aren\u2019t looking great for England, let\u2019s offer up a bit of optimism for our English friends who may just be waking up. There\u2019s a chance this could just be a very good batting wicket and Australia might have just as many struggles to restrict and take wickets once they come on to bowl. Brunt struggles with her line early in this over and has trouble getting control back. She desperately wants that breakthrough, but the run rate keeps marching forwards and Brunt isn\u2019t having her best day out.\n\n\n\n 4.31am  \n\n38th over: Australia 221-1 (Alyssa Healy 117, Beth Mooney 24)\nCross thinks Christmas has come early first ball as Healy backs away and shows off all three of her stumps, but the ball flies past them. Next ball Healy scoops one brilliantly past fine leg for four and her footwork is sensational today. Cross isn\u2019t bowling badly, but it will take an excellent ball to stop Healy in this kind of form. We get a stumping appeal against Mooney on the final ball of the over and the umpires take a look at it, but Mooney\u2019s foot remains grounded in the crease and England can\u2019t get that lucky.\n\n\n\n 4.26am  \n\n37th over: Australia 216-1 (Alyssa Healy 112, Beth Mooney 24)\nIn all the excitement of the previous over, Australia also brought up their 200, an omnious sign with 14 overs left. This over they bring up their half century partnership in what feels like the blink of an eye. A couple of singles to start this Shrubsole over and then an aggressive pull shot from Mooney thatsignifies her intent as well. She follows that up with an elegant cut for four and the Australian juggernaut keeps on pushing forward.\n\n\n\n 4.23am  \n\n36th over: Australia 208-1 (Alyssa Healy 111, Beth Mooney 17)\nCross comes back into the attack and Healy shows her intent early with an aggressive pull shot. She only gets two runs from it, but it\u2019s clear that now she\u2019s passed her 100 milestone, she\u2019s going to have some fun with this and go as hard as she can. Which (in case this is your first encounter with Alyssa Healy) is extremely hard. Next ball she drives one past deep extra cover for four before getting off strike and giving Mooney a look in. Mooney attempts a little paddle, but doesn\u2019t time it quite right and backtracks down a more traditional route next ball for an easy single. Healy finishes the over by lofting a ball over mid off for another effortless looking boundary.\n\n\n\n 4.17am  \n\n35th over: Australia 196-1 (Alyssa Healy 100, Beth Mooney 16)\nHealy takes strike on 99 with Shrubsole coming back into the attack and she defends the first ball back, she\u2019s not in a hurry here. On the next ball she sees her chance and calls with the loudest \u201cYES\u201d I\u2019ve heard and brings up back-to-back centuries in these two finals matches. She heads straight to Beth Mooney for a hug before celebrating for the crowd and raising her bat. These two have spent a lot of time batting together and it\u2019s a lovely little celebratory moment for them. Despite the fact that it\u2019s an away crowd, the fans are genuinely excited to witness this moment and they\u2019re on their feet in appreciation of what they\u2019ve seen today. \n\n\nUpdated at 4.35am BST\n\n\n 4.13am  \n\n34th over: Australia 187-1 (Alyssa Healy 99, Beth Mooney 12)\nThe run rate is sneaking up towards six an over, with both of these batters striking at over 100. Healy again is happy to take a single and can\u2019t be tempted into going big to hasten her century. Ecclestone still looks to be the best of the English bowlers and slows the runs down, but it won\u2019t worry Australia.\n\n\n\n 4.10am  \n\n33rd over: Australia 185-1 (Alyssa Healy 98, Beth Mooney 12)\nHealy starts the over on strike to Sciver\u2019s bowling and she\u2019s looking very relaxed close to her century. She doesn\u2019t seem like she wants to do it in one hit and is happy to share the strike with Mooney. The Australian team is looking extremely relaxed on the sidelines - as well they might! Mooney goes unconventionally to Sciver\u2019s bumper and plays a little jumping cut shot over her head for four. \n\n\nUpdated at 4.29am BST\n\n\n 4.06am  \n\n32nd over: Australia 175-1 (Alyssa Healy 96, Beth Mooney 5)\nHealy moves ever closer to her century, going at an excellent strike rate of over 100 as well. Ecclestone looks to emulate her previous effort and take another wicket, but she\u2019s not troubling Mooney or Healy too much just yet. \n\n\n\n 4.03am  \n\n31st over: Australia 170-1 (Alyssa Healy 93, Beth Mooney 3)\nSciver returns and Mooney immediately drives it to deep cover for a single and keeps the strike rotating. Sending Mooney in has allowed Australia to keep up the left-right combination and every time the strike rotates, they\u2019re asking a new question of the England bowlers and fielders. Healy plays a beautiful straight drive late in the over and Brunt sprints across to field it, gets there in time, but the ball bounces off her hand and finds the rope anyway. Brunt takes some time to get up after landing heavily on her shoulder and the umpires take drinks with a ball remaining in the over while Brunt composes herself. The final ball is eventually bowled and Healy takes a quick single from it.\n\n\n\n 3.55am  \n\n30th over: Australia 162-1 (Alyssa Healy 87, Beth Mooney 1)\nHere comes Ecclestone again - she has looked the best of the English bowlers and she proves me right immediately but taking Haynes\u2019s wicket from the first ball of the over. Lanning decides to give herself a bit of a rest and sends Mooney in instead - a well-deserved opportunity after her brilliant tournament so far. Healy gets Mooney on strike and she gets off the mark immediately and they don\u2019t look like losing a wicket is going to slow their momentum too much.\n\n\n\n 3.53am  \nWICKET! Haynes 68, c Beaumont b Ecclestone, Australia 160-1\n\nFinally England get their breakthrough! Ecclestone catches the edge of Haynes\u2019s bat as she looks to go big and it\u2019s a comfortable catch for Tammy Beaumont inside the circle at point.\n\n\nUpdated at 4.27am BST\n\n\n 3.51am  \n\n29th over: Australia 160-0 (Alyssa Healy 86, Rachael Haynes 68)\nEd Mackereth on email is feeling for England, but holding on to a touch of hope:\n\u201cIt must be brutal to have to bowl against Healy and Haynes in this form. England are going to need to have a great day with the bat to make a contest of this. Fingers crossed.\u201d\nHe\u2019s wondering if the 400 might be on for Australia and I think in this form, you probably can\u2019t count that out. Sciver picks up where Brunt left off with a more economical over, but there are still plenty of singles in it. If not wickets, England need more dot balls at least, but they can\u2019t find them and Healy pulls one cleanly off the last ball for four to rub salt into England\u2019s many wounds.\n\n\n\n 3.47am  \n\n28th over: Australia 152-0 (Alyssa Healy 80, Rachael Haynes 66)\nSome more Brunt and Australia brings up the 150 partnership immediately. It\u2019s a good bounceback from Brunt, but she can\u2019t find that wicket ball. Restricting Australia to a few singles in an over isn\u2019t going to cut it at this point.\n\n\n\n 3.42am  \n\n27th over: Australia 149-0 (Alyssa Healy 78, Rachael Haynes 65)\nWhat can England do here? The game looks to be rapidly slipping from their grasp. With an Australian team that bats so deep, taking early wickets is essential to get into the batters who haven\u2019t had has much time in the middle. Healy has taken her strike rate up over 100 after a slow start and Haynes is playing her role to perfection. Dean is struggling, but there aren\u2019t too many answers elsewhere either.\n\n\n\n 3.40am  \n\n26th over: Australia 142-0 (Alyssa Healy 73, Rachael Haynes 63)\nBrunt comes around the wicket to Haynes and the singles are still easy pickings for the Australians. After a couple of those, Healy times one beautifully off her hip and sends it down past fine leg to the boundary. She rotates the strike and Haynes takes her own opportunity to go fine for a boundary. Brunt looks frustrated, it\u2019s been a rough over for her.\n\n\n\n 3.36am  \n\n25th over: Australia 131-0 (Alyssa Healy 67, Rachael Haynes 58)\nAt the halfway point now and the Australians are in cruise control. Dean comes back into the attack and looks for a more economical over than she\u2019s offered up so far. She starts well enough, but Healy pounces on the third ball to send a ball flying over Ecclestone\u2019s head to the boundary. Katey Martin in commentary isn\u2019t happy with Dean\u2019s change of hairstyle for this match - she thinks Dean should be more superstitious in keeping things the same while they\u2019re working. At this rate, Martin would be very well accepted in Netball Twitter, where changes in trademark hairstyles are a big talking point. Not a great over from Dean again, so maybe Martin has a point?\n\n\n\n 3.31am  \n\n24th over: Australia 120-0 (Alyssa Healy 58, Rachael Haynes 57)\nBrunt comes back into the attack and Amy Jones comes up to the stumps to attempt to cramp the batters up a little and stop them dancing down the wicket to the ball so often. It\u2019s working in part, but there\u2019s just nothing to faze these two at the moment and they\u2019re happy to take the singles while they\u2019re on offer, they see no need to take unnecessary risks. \n\n\n\n 3.27am  \n\n23rd over: Australia 115-0 (Alyssa Healy 56, Rachael Haynes 54)\nCross\u2019s frustration is starting to show after her fielders dropped two catches off her bowling last over and her first ball is too short and allows Healy to bring up her 50 with a nicely pulled shot for four. The next ball is better and finds Healy\u2019s edge, but everything is falling Australia\u2019s way at the moment and that one heads to the boundary as well. Cross comes around the wicket to Haynes when she gets on strike and the line looks better, but still not dangerous enough to trouble these openers. This is not the economical Cross we\u2019re used to.\n\n\n\n 3.23am  \n\n22nd over: Australia 105-0 (Alyssa Healy 47, Rachael Haynes 53)\nEcclestone has a big appeal early in this over, but with only one review remaining they decide not to challenge the umpire\u2019s decision. Australia bring up their 100 and it\u2019s all looking too easy for them at the moment as the run rate creeps up towards five. England are fielding well on the boundary, but they need more than that right now.\n\n\n\n 3.20am  \n\n21st over: Australia 98-0 (Alyssa Healy 43, Rachael Haynes 50)\nCross finally gets a genuine chance with a Haynes edge, but Danni Wyatt puts it down, which you absolutely cannot do against Haynes ever, but especially in a World Cup final after this start. The disappointment on Cross\u2019s face tells the story and she offers them another chance, but this time it\u2019s Sciver that drops the catch. Haynes brings up her half century and it\u2019s not a happy time for England. \n\n\nUpdated at 3.24am BST\n\n\n 3.16am  \n\n20th over: Australia 92-0 (Alyssa Healy 40, Rachael Haynes 47)\nIf this was a T20, England would be patting themselves on the back for a great bowling performance to restrict Australia to a small total. But alas, this an ODI and it\u2019s a simply a platform for the Australians to spring from later in the game. Ecclestone and Cross are doing a better job at stemming the flow of runs, but it\u2019s wickets that are desperately needed here and they\u2019re not looking like picking them up right now. \n\n\n\n 3.13am  \n\n19th over: Australia 86-0 (Alyssa Healy 38, Rachael Haynes 43)\nCross bowls her first ball a touch too short and Haynes pulls it away nicely, but the field keeps it to a single. Healy keeps things very calm. They know they may not get boundary balls from Cross, but they\u2019re also not letting her build dot ball pressure and keeping the game on their terms. This is now the highest opening partnership in a World Cup final and England will need to break it very soon if they want to have a shot at winning this. \n\n\n\n 3.09am  \n\n18th over: Australia 81-0 (Alyssa Healy 36, Rachael Haynes 41)\nWe take a little drinks break and England have used six bowlers so far, which is just about all their options, so it would be nice to see a little bit of Knight bowling at some point! Ecclestone continues and she gets Healy playing in the air, but unfortunately for her, it\u2019s a very controlled shot and she lofts it over the field into a gap and it bounces over the boundary for four. \n\n\n\n 3.03am  \n\n17th over: Australia 76-0 (Alyssa Healy 32, Rachael Haynes 40)\nKate Cross gets her first shot at these two batters - she has incredibly consistent this tournament and has had impeccable line and length. She will want to take wickets, but at the very least she should manage to build a bit more pressure and encourage the batters to take some risks at the other end. It\u2019s a difficult time for her to come in though, Healy and Haynes are so settled and comfortable and they are rotating the strike easily. Their footwork is very good and they\u2019re moving to the ball so well - they will be very hard to stop. Cross isn\u2019t throwing out loose balls, but she\u2019s not making them panic either. \n\n\nUpdated at 3.22am BST\n\n\n 2.59am  \n\n16th over: Australia 70-0 (Alyssa Healy 30, Rachael Haynes 37)\nOur woman of the moment has arrived - Sophie Ecclestone comes on for her first over of the day. She was sensational against South Africa in the semi final and she\u2019ll want to take wickets here. There\u2019s an appeal for LBW in the middle of the over and Knight decides they can review this one. Unfortunately for them, Healy got an inside edge before it hit her pad and England lose their review. It\u2019s a decent over from Ecclestone, just the two from it.\n\n\n\n 2.55am  \n\n15th over: Australia 68-0 (Alyssa Healy 29, Rachael Haynes 36)\nSafe to say that this wouldn\u2019t have been the start England were aiming for. You don\u2019t ever want to let the Australian openers get to this point and they just haven\u2019t had the answers to stop them going about their business very confidently. Sciver does a better job this over, dragging the momentum back after letting two runs go from the first ball, but more pressure is needed.\n\n\n\n 2.51am  \n\n14th over: Australia 63-0 (Alyssa Healy 26, Rachael Haynes 34)\nSo far we\u2019ve had two Mitchell Starc sightings on screen - let\u2019s keep track of how many we get during the match. Hopefully we get just as many of Alyssa Healy next time she\u2019s in the stands watching him play. Dean misses her line in the middle of the over and again Haynes pounces and cuts it late for four. Dean hasn\u2019t had the effect England were hoping for as yet and Haynes finds another she likes on the last ball of the over with a drive to the boundary this time.\n\n\nUpdated at 2.56am BST\n\n\n 2.48am  \n\n13th over: Australia 54-0 (Alyssa Healy 25, Rachael Haynes 26)\nAustralia have dragged the run rate up above four an over now and it\u2019s an excellent platform for them to launch from. They bring up the 50 partnership from the first ball of the Sciver over. It\u2019s an economical start to the over from England, but Australia are finding these singles a little too easily and England need to build more pressure.\n\n\n\n 2.44am  \n\n12th over: Australia 49-0 (Alyssa Healy 22, Rachael Haynes 24)\nWe get our first look at Charlie Dean for today as England look to take some pace out of the game and make Healy and Haynes work a little harder for their runs and maybe take a few risks. Dean is an attacking off spinner and she will look to take wickets here. Healy doesn\u2019t take long to find a ball she likes the look of, coming down the pitch and drives one past long on for four. \n\n\n\n 2.40am  \n\n11th over: Australia 42-0 (Alyssa Healy 16, Rachael Haynes 23)\nSciver continues and Healy takes a risky run from her off the second ball - a better throw would have easily removed Haynes at the keeper\u2019s end. Haynes celebrates surviving that run out attempt by eagerly latching on to a short ball and pulling it away for four. \n\n\n\n 2.37am  \n\n10th over: Australia 37-0 (Alyssa Healy 15, Rachael Haynes 19)\nShrubsole keeps her spot at the City end and Healy plays out a couple of dots before she plays a beautiful straight drive straight past the bowler for four. Healy is looking very confident now and clips the next ball away for a single to give Haynes the strike. Haynes is comfortable playing out the over and Australia gets through the powerplay unscathed.\n\n\n\n 2.33am  \n\n9th over: Australia 32-0 (Alyssa Healy 10, Rachael Haynes 19)\nBrunt has been replaced by Sciver at the Port Hills end and Healy is quite happy with the change once she gets on strike and starts to make her mark on the game with a confident boundary.\n\n\n\n 2.32am  \n\n8th over: Australia 26-0 (Alyssa Healy 5, Rachael Haynes 18)\nShrubsole starts the over well, hurrying Haynes up and the fielders keeping the pressure on with plenty of urgency to back her up and prevent the quick singles. Haynes doesn\u2019t seem too troubled by it, her strong over against Brunt gives her plenty of breathing room and eventually a nice straight drive gives her the opportunity to get off strike.\n\n\nUpdated at 2.55am BST\n\n\n 2.26am  \n\n7th over: Australia 25-0 (Alyssa Healy 5, Rachael Haynes 17)\nHaynes finally gets the ball she was looking for - Brunt bangs one in a bit shot and Haynes pulls it away to the boundary for four. A length ball is defended away before Brunt gives away another one that\u2019s a bit too short and Haynes delights in another pull shot to the boundary. It\u2019s the best over for Australia so far and Brunt will need to have a think about her length.\n\n\n\n 2.23am  \n\n6th over: Australia 16-0 (Alyssa Healy 5, Rachael Haynes 8)\nShrubsole starts the over coming around the wicket to Haynes - a change up she throws in every now and then in an attempt to unsettle the left hander and bring the LBW into play. The first two balls are good, but the third drifts too far down leg side and is given a wide. She continues around the wicket, but pulls her line back a touch and doesn\u2019t offer Haynes anything but a single to get off strike. Shrubsole comes back over the wicket to the right handed Healy. She\u2019s bowling to her field very well, so despite good shots, Healy can\u2019t get the ball past the fielders. There\u2019s an appeal on the last ball of the over but the umpire says no and Shrubsole can\u2019t convince Knight to review. \n\n\n\n 2.18am  \n\n5th over: Australia 14-0 (Alyssa Healy 5, Rachael Haynes 8)\nIt\u2019s a good crowd in today, which is great news considering NZ didn\u2019t make the final four. The tournament organisers have done a great job in keeping the crowds engaged and giving it a real big event feel, so it doesn\u2019t matter to the fans who is playing, they just want to be a part of it. Brunt has a big appeal early in the over, but it\u2019s sliding down leg and she\u2019s smart enough not to review it. The next ball is even better, it\u2019s doing so much it may evolve into a member of the team before too long. Haynes punches one down the ground late in the over that\u2019s fast enough to evade Brunt, but only enough for a single.\n\n\n\n 2.14am  \n\n4th over: Australia 11-0 (Alyssa Healy 5, Rachael Haynes 6)\nIt\u2019s a bit of a cat and mouse game going on so far - the English bowlers are mostly bowling very good line and length and the Australian batters are just waiting on the opportunities for the slightly looser balls to pounce on. It\u2019s a very good over from Shrubsole, just one from it.\n\n\n\n 2.11am  \n\n3rd over: Australia 10-0 (Alyssa Healy 5, Rachael Haynes 5)\nBrunt resumes and Healy is looking a little bit cautious. In the past that would have been a bad sign for her, but she seems to have settled those nerves of late and is able to play her way into a game even with a cautious start. It isn\u2019t long before she finds a shorter ball from Brunt that she likes the look of and cuts one beautifully past deep backward point for her first boundary. Brunt tightens up her length and finishes with two dot balls.\n\n\n\n 2.07am  \n\n2nd over: Australia 6-0 (Alyssa Healy 1, Rachael Haynes 5)\nAnya Shrubsole takes the new ball from the city end - no surprises there. Haynes defends one back to her, then plays a delivery that\u2019s heading towards leg stump very fine and down past fine leg for the first boundary of the match. Shrubsole tightens up her line to the left hander and it\u2019s a good match up between these two so far. Shrubsole won\u2019t want to let Haynes get too settled though, she is dangerous once she\u2019s got her eye in.\n\n\n\n 2.04am  \n\n1st over: Australia 2-0 (Alyssa Healy 1, Rachael Haynes 1)\nWe\u2019re underway at Christchurch\u2019s Hagley Oval! Brunt takes the new ball from the Port Hills end. She starts with a dot ball to Healy and then bowls a lovely one that dances just past the outside edge of Healy\u2019s bat. Her length is very good today and in the middle of the over, Healy manages to find a little something and gets her away for a single to get off the mark and bring Haynes on to strike. Haynes flicks one away for a single and Healy finishes with a defensive shot to make for a good first over for Brunt.\n\n\n\n 1.52am  \n\nWell while we wait for the first ball, here are a few things you can read to get you up to speed for this game.\nFirstly, this great piece from Geoff Lemon on the gulf in class between the teams. If you\u2019re more inclined to the opposite point of view, Nat Sciver has you covered in this story about why England can win it. Or if you want to make me happy, have a read of this story on Australia\u2019s spin queen Alana King!\n\n\nUpdated at 2.58am BST\n\n\n 1.40am  \n\nWell the big news from the team lists is that Ellyse Perry is back for Australia. It\u2019s unlikely that she\u2019ll bowl, but she\u2019ll be hoping for a big game with the bat. Although she is Australia\u2019s biggest name, I don\u2019t think it would have troubled the favourites too much if Perry hadn\u2019t been able to play. But she truly deserves this opportunity and after missing the T20 World Cup final in 2020, this is a huge moment for her. England come in with an unchanged line up from the semi - no surprises there, as they were strong in all areas of that game.\n\n\n\n 1.37am  \nEngland XI\n\nTammy Beaumont\nDanni Wyatt\nHeather Knight (c)\nNatalie Sciver\nAmy Jones (wk)\nSophia Dunkley\nKatherine Brunt\nSophie Ecclestone\nCharlie Dean\nKate Cross\nAnya Shrubsole \n\n\n\n 1.36am  \nAustralia XI\n\nAlyssa Healy (wk)\nRachael Haynes\nMeg Lanning (c)\nEllyse Perry\nBeth Mooney\nTahlia McGrath\nAshleigh Gardner\nAlana King\nJess Jonassen\nMegan Schutt\nDarcie Brown \n\n\n\n 1.34am  \nEngland win the toss and elect to bowl\n\nHeather Knight says they want to get out as a team to start this game and thinks this pitch might do a little bit. Of course playing on her mind must be the fact that Meg Lanning absolutely loves a chase, so that might be the first step to pushing them out of their comfort zone. Of course, plenty of teams have forced Australia to bat first this World Cup and it hasn\u2019t particularly helped! But it\u2019s certainly a confidence boost and if they can take early wickets, they will be buyoed by that.\n\n\n\n 1.28am  \nPreamble\n\nWelcome! Well, after four weeks of fierce competition, we\u2019ve reached the final and it\u2019s Australia v England - the first time these two nations have met in a World Cup final since 1988, which is quite frankly wild. It would have seemed an unlikely scenario earlier in the tournament. England started with three losses on the trot and looked every bit as hapless as they did during the Ashes. But somehow they rallied, Danni Wyatt started scoring runs, Katherine Brunt started looking fearsome again and Sophie Ecclestone showed why she is such a world class spinner. It started with a dominant win over England, followed by a clutch victory over New Zealand. They sailed past Pakistan and Bangladesh and found themselves in a semi final against South Africa. It was in that game where they really showed their turnaround in form, putting 293 on the board, before bowling SA out for 156 in 38 overs. It\u2019s been an incredible run and they won\u2019t want to waste this opportunity they\u2019ve given themselves.\nIn contrast, Australia has barely been challenged. There have been a couple of instances where they lost early wickets and to the casual observer may have looked like they were in trouble. But their batting line up is just so deep and they have so much belief that there\u2019s never a moment of panic. They were unconvincing against Bangladesh and India took them into the final over of the match, but Beth Mooney\u2019s unflappable nature just keeps on propelling them towards wins. It will take a particularly special effort from England to beat them today, but anything can happen in a World Cup final. If England finds a way to make Australia panic, to finally shift them even slightly out of their comfort zone, they could be in with a chance.\nIt\u2019s going to be a big day, so stay with us as we guide you through the action. We\u2019ll bring you the result of the toss and how the teams will line up very soon!\n\n\nUpdated at 3.00am BST\n"

                    "body": "Firing forehand winners past a legend and pumping his fists in a ferocious manner, Alex de Minaur gave the United Cup the local morale boost it needed on Monday night in Sydney. In front of an adoring audience at Ken Rosewall Arena, the Australian spearhead overcame a set deficit on his favourite court to defeat Rafael Nadal 3-6 6-1 7-5 for the first time. But his thrilling victory in the inaugural competition also served as a reminder of what Australian tennis has lost given the remodelling of the Davis and Billie Jean King Cups in recent years.  Those events once provided the best atmosphere in tennis. Partisan crowds almost always enhanced the occasion. Generations of players were inspired watching their heroes in national colours in ties from Melbourne to Mildura, from Perth to Cairns. But the centralisation of the competitions has eroded that passion. Without those ties, dreams could be dashed. As a case in point, Australian teams performed admirably to reach the finals of both the Davis Cup and Billie Jean King Cup in November. The men were beaten by Canada in Spain. The women fell to Switzerland in Glasgow. But both finals were played in the middle of the night, far removed from the eyes of young Australians, and drew nowhere near the attention they once would have around the nation. As finalists, Australia automatically qualify for the latter stages of both events in 2023, meaning the Davis and Billie Jean King Cup teams will be absent from home soil for at least another year. It gives the United Cup an opportunity to fill what has become a gaping void for Australians starved of regularly watching their best men and women in the traditional team competitions. The large crowds who have attended Australia\u2019s clashes against Great Britain and Spain at Ken Rosewall Arena over the past week demonstrate again just how strong that appetite is. The United Cup can only go so far, with Australia to alternate between Sydney, Perth and Brisbane on a triennial basis. But every three years fans in those cities can cheer on their local heroes. Young fans fortunate to watch de Minaur deliver on Monday must feel as inspired as the Australian was by those barracking for him. De Minaur said \u201cenjoying the atmosphere, the crowd, [where] you almost want to get the crowd involved after every single point and get fired up after every single point\u201d added to the thrill. A challenge for each of the Cups is to both lure fans and recreate this type of fervent passion for ties involving countries without the fortune of being able to play at home. De Minaur\u2019s triumph preceded a staunch defence of the inaugural event by Tennis Australia chief executive Craig Tiley on Tuesday in Melbourne. Tiley believes there is proof the event will be a success in Australia, stating that 40,000 fans attended ties played across the three host cities on Monday. In accepting this point, it must be noted that two-for-one ticket deals were on offer leading into the start of the tournament amid reports that sales were slow. \u201cThe United Cup is absolutely fantastic. If you watched last night, we\u2019ve had full stadiums. We\u2019ve had over 120,000 people already go through the gate,\u201d Tiley said. \u201cThat\u2019s remarkable. We\u2019ve never had that. It beats most major tennis events around the world for one day\u2019s attendance.\u201d But the withdrawal of Australia\u2019s top ranked players Nick Kyrgios and Ajla Tomljanovic was a significant blow and the reaction has proven far from united, despite Tiley\u2019s claim of \u201cunbelievably successful, great, positive feedback from the players.\u201d Nadal best signifies the conflict between those who see the United Cup\u2019s potential and what it currently is. The joy at watching his support for teammates is among the highlights to date. American great Chris Evert noted, watching Nadal scream his support for Badosa \u201cwarms my heart\u201d. Similar support has been evident on the team benches across the competition. Former world doubles No 1 Paul McNamee, co-founder of the Hopman Cup that ran in Australia until 2019, has long been an advocate for mixed teams events. He believes the mixed doubles rubber is the competition\u2019s best asset and believes it should be played earlier in the tie to add to its importance. Still, Nadal\u2019s criticism of a convoluted format on Monday night is among the reasons Tiley was forced to defend the United Cup on Tuesday. Earlier losses to Great Britain downgraded the Australia-Spain tie given the title hopes of both nations were shot (though it is worth noting ranking points and prize money were on the line in matches). Both Paula Badosa and Zoe Hives opted against playing a rubber scheduled for Tuesday night, citing shoulder and abdomen injuries respectively as precautionary measures ahead of the Australian Open. \u201c[The] competition is great. [The] idea is great. It\u2019s not great that today we are playing for nothing,\u201d Nadal said. Tiley himself acknowledged aspects of the United Cup require tinkering but said some problems stemmed from rushing to bring the event forward a year from an original date of 2024. \u201cWe\u2019ll do a debrief [on] what can be improved for 2024,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a great event. It\u2019s going to finish really strong in the finals in Sydney.\u201d"

Thanks so much for following along and be sure to check out Tumaini Carayol\u2019s full match report here.\n\n\n\n\n 1.03am  \nFederer: 'It's been a perfect journey'\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been perfect journey, I would do it all over again,\u201d Federer says. Asked to reflect on his journey from junior champion to grand slam champion to sporting icon, he says: \u201cIt was never supposed to be that way. I was just happy to play tennis and spend time with my friends, really.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s been so much fun,\u201d he adds. \u201cIt\u2019s been amazing. Thank you, everybody. I\u2019ve had so many people cheer me on. And you guys here tonight, it means the world.\u201d\nFederer is then asked about how much his family\u2019s support helped him along the way, and that\u2019s when the waterworks really open up.\n\u201cWe have to go there?\u201d he says, jokingly. \u201cI\u2019ve done OK so far I feel. I\u2019m at least able to talk. In my vision I was never able to talk, so I\u2019m doing way better. Everybody\u2019s here tonight from my family, so it\u2019s great. I\u2019ve had so much fun over the last 13 years [of marriage]. Everybody\u2019s here, the girls, the boys. My wife\u2019s been so supportive. She could have stopped me a long, long time ago, but she didn\u2019t. She kept me going and allowed me to play. It\u2019s amazing. Thank you.\u201d\nHe continues, barely able to form sentences at this point through the tears: \u201cI find it always funny that we always blame my mom for everything, because without her, I wouldn\u2019t be here of course. So thanks to my parents, you have been amazing. Thank you. And just everybody, too many people to thank. It\u2019s just been incredible, my God. A fantastic night. Thank you, everybody.\u201d\n\nUpdated at 1.10am BST\n\n\n 12.53am  \n\n\u201cIt feels great to be here,\u201d Federer says. \u201cI enjoyed tying my shoes one more time. Everything was the last time. And funny enough, with all the matches and having the guys being here \u2013 fans, family, friends \u2013 I didn\u2019t feel the stress so much, even though I did think [an injury might happen] in the match. So I am so happy I made it through. The match was great. I couldn\u2019t be happier. It\u2019s been wonderful. And of course, playing with Rafa on the same team and having the guys \u2013 everybody here, all the legends \u2013 Rocket, Edberg, Stefan, thank you.\u201d\nHe\u2019s asked how special it was to finish playing alongside the other greats of his era: Djokovic, Murray and Nadal.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t want it to feel lonely out there,\u201d he says. \u201cIt felt lonely for a second when they told me to go out, or you wanted me to come out one more time. I feel great, but to be saying goodbye as a team \u2013 I always felt I was a team player at the heart \u2013 but singles doesn\u2019t really do that a whole lot. I\u2019ve had a team that traveled with me for around the world. It\u2019s been amazing with them. So thanks to everybody who made it work for so many years. And then of course, being on the team with Andy, Thomas, Novak, Mateo, Cam, Stefanos, Rafa and Casper and also the other team: you guys are unbelievable. It\u2019s been a pleasure, playing all these Laver Cups.\n\u201cIt does feel like a celebration to me. I wanted it to feel like this at the end and it\u2019s exactly what I hoped for. So thank you.\u201d\n\n\n\n 12.38am  \n\nA Federer tribute video is playing on the big screen. Federer, still overcome by emotion, looks up from the court. Once it finishes, he\u2019s called out for an on-court interview with Jim Courier.\n\u201cWe\u2019ll get through this somehow,\u201d he says, voice trembling. \u201cIt\u2019s been a wonderful day. I told the guys: I\u2019m happy, I\u2019m not sad.\u201d\n\n\n\n 12.29am  \n\nAfter shaking hands with Tiafoe and Sock at the net, a teary-eyed Federer returns to the Team Europe bench. He hugs each of his team-mates as David Guetta\u2019s Titanium blasts through the O2 Arena sound system before heading over to the Team World bench and doing the same. Every soul in the building in on their feat in a standing ovation, screaming their throats out. Federer takes a seat, the tears streaming down his face. Behind him, Nadal is crying as well. What a moment.\n\nUpdated at 12.36am BST\n\n\n 12.26am  \nSock/Tiafoe win match, 4-6, 7-6 (2), 11-9!\n\nThird-set match tiebreaker: Federer/Nadal 9-11 Sock/Tiafoe\nAnd the Americans blink again as a forced error puts them down a minibreak. Federer to serve at 9-8 with the match on his racket! But Tiafoe pulls it out of the fire after the changeover, winning the next point for 9-all. Federer with one more serve ... but Tiafoe responds with an absolutely thunderous forehand return winner. Match point for Team World with Sock serving at 10-9 ... and after a lengthy rally Sock ends it with a forehand winner into the corner. It\u2019s over!\n\n\nUpdated at 12.41am BST\n\n\n 12.21am  \n\nThird-set match tiebreaker: Federer/Nadal 8-8 Sock/Tiafoe* (*denotes next server)\nThe Americans stay on serve behind another big Sock second serve. Now it\u2019s Nadal with the next two points on his racket serving at 6-7. Federer slots a forehand winner at the end of a tense rally for 7-all, sending the crowd into roars. But Tiafoe rips a forehand directly into Nadal\u2019s back to put Team World up a minibreak, drawing murmurs of consternation from the crowd. Tiafoe serving at 8-7 ... and a missed backhand by Tiafoe puts them back on serve at 8-all!\n\n\n\n 12.17am  \n\nThird-set match tiebreaker: Federer/Nadal 6-6 Sock/Tiafoe* (*denotes next server)\nFederer/Nadal win the next two points behind Federer\u2019s big serve. Sock with the next two points on his racket serving at 5-6. Federer overcooks a return and they\u2019ll change ends knotted at 6-all. First to 10 points, remember.\n\n\n\n 12.15am  \n\nThird-set match tiebreaker: *Federer/Nadal 4-5 Sock/Tiafoe (*denotes next server)\nAn unbelievable scoop-shot winner by Sock at the net puts the Americans ahead by a minibreak. He pumps his fist and screams in disbelief while playing to the crowd. Tiafoe with the first of two points on his racket at 4-3 ... and a Federer winner puts them back on serve at 4-all. A sliding winner as Sock loses his footing at the net keeps them there. Federer to serve at 4-5.\n\n\n\n 12.12am  \n\nThird-set match tiebreaker: *Federer/Nadal 3-3 Sock/Tiafoe (*denotes next server)\nIt\u2019s 10 minutes past midnight in London as the final stretch of Roger Federer\u2019s career is under way. Sock and Tiafoe blink first, quickly going down a minibreak on the first point. Nadal and Federer follow with winners and Sock faces an early pressure point serving at love-3. He answers with a booming ace then forces Nadal into an error. Then forced error on Nadal\u2019s serve gives the American another minibreak and levels the match at 3-all at the changeover.\n\n\n\n 12.07am  \nSock/Tiafoe win second set 7-6 (2)!\n\nSecond set: Federer/Nadal 6-4, 6-7 (2-7) Sock/Tiafoe\nA couple of loose points on the Federer serve and suddenly Sock and Tiafoe have four set points. And they need only one. Federer is forced into an error and we\u2019re headed to a first-to-10 tiebreaker to decide this match!\n\nUpdated at 12.08am BST\n\n\n 12.04am  \n\nSecond set tiebreaker: Federer/Nadal 2-4 Sock/Tiafoe* (*denotes next server)\nTeam Europe goes down a minibreak again on another unforced error by Nadal. They win the next point and now Sock will serve at 3-2. Another forced error at the end of a long rally makes it 4-2 to Sock/Tiafoe with the next point on their racket after the change of ends.\n\n\n\n 12.01am  \n\nSecond set tiebreaker: *Federer/Nadal 1-2 Sock/Tiafoe (*denotes next server)\nFederer serves to start but Tiafoe conjures another massive return winner to immediately give Team World the early minibreak. Nadal, whose level has dropped, nets a backhand at the net, but a forced error by Sock puts them back on serve. Nadal to serve at 1-2.\n\n\n\n 11.58pm  \n\nSecond set: Federer/Nadal 6-4, 6-6 Sock/Tiafoe \nSock cracks an ace to open his service game but a Federer winner makes it 15-all. A trade of points makes it 30-all and Federer and Nadal are two points from the finish line once more. Another trade of forced errors pushes it to deuce. Then Tiafoe follows with a deft forehand winner at the net before a netted backhand by Federer gifts Sock and Tiafoe the hold. We\u2019re headed to a second-set breaker!\n\n\n\n 11.52pm  \n\nSecond set: Federer/Nadal 6-4, 6-5 Sock/Tiafoe* (*denotes next server)\nNadal falls behind love-15 on his serve on a sharp return by Tiafoe. The opportunity widens after Tiafoe punds a backhand winner for love-30, then further still after winning the next exchange for love-40 and triple break point. The Federer/Nadal team saved the first and second on a couple of forced errors, then the third when Sock frames a forehand on the approach and sends it past the baseline. Deuce. A forced error pushes Federer/Nadal to the brink of the game, but Tiafoe hits a sizzling forehand winner for deuce number two. An untimely Nadal double fault then gives Sock/Tiafoe a fourth look at a break, but Federer erases it with a forehand winner. A fifth break chance follows moments later, but Tiafoe can\u2019t handle a Nadal\u2019s forehand missle and we\u2019re back to deuce. An electric rally covering every inch of the court follows, maybe the point of the match, and Sock ends it with a backhand winner for a sixth break-point chance in this game, which is now past the 10-minute mark. And that one is saved too when Sock nets a forehand. From there Nadal holds, winning the last two points on a couple of unforced errors by the Americans. Whew!\n\n\n\n 11.41pm  \n\nSecond set: *Federer/Nadal 6-4, 5-5 Sock/Tiafoe (*denotes next server)\nAfter winning two quick points, Tiafoe double-faults for 30-15. Then Sock nets a forehand at the net and suddenly Federer and Nadal are two points from the finish line at 30-all. But they\u2019re able to escape with the hold after Nadal makes an unforced error and Sock closes it out with an overhand smash.\n\n\n\n 11.36pm  \n\nSecond set: Federer/Nadal 6-4, 5-4 Sock/Tiafoe* (*denotes next server)\nAnother moment of pressure on Federer\u2019s serve as a Tiafoe winner at the net pushes it to 30-all from 30-love. A trade of unforced errors gets it to deuce, but Federer holds comfortably from there. Tiafoe will serve to stay in the match after the change of ends.\n\n\n\n 11.32pm  \n\nSecond set: *Federer/Nadal 6-4, 4-4 Sock/Tiafoe (*denotes next server)\nSock races out to 40-love on his serve before double-faulting, then nailing down the hold on the next point.\n\n\n\n 11.31pm  \n\nSecond set: Federer/Nadal 6-4, 4-3 Sock/Tiafoe* (*denotes next server)\nNadal backs up the break for Team Europe with a stress-free hold. The intensity of this match has markedly gone up in the last quarter hour.\n\n\n\n\n 11.28pm  \n\nFederer/Nadal break in sixth game of second set!\nSecond set: *Federer/Nadal 6-4, 3-3 Sock/Tiafoe (*denotes next server)\nTiafoe falls behind love-15 then 15-30 on his serve. He then double-faults for the first time in the match and suddenly Federer and Nadal have two opportunities to break back. And they need only one. Fedal win a lightly disputed point when Tiafoe appears to hit the ball twice. Team Europe have the break and we\u2019re back on serve in the second.\n\n\n\n 11.22pm  \n\nSecond set: Federer/Nadal 6-4, 3-2 Sock/Tiafoe* (*denotes next server)\nFederer is pushed to 30-all on his serve, but a couple of unforced errors by Sock and Tiafoe see the Europeans through to the hold.\n\n\n\n 11.18pm  \n\nSecond set: *Federer/Nadal 6-4, 2-2 Sock/Tiafoe (*denotes next server)\nAnd now the pressure immediately swings to the Team World as Sock, who is playing his fourth set of the day, goes down 15-30 on his serve. He then nets a running forehand from the baseline early in a rally for 15-40, giving the Federer/Nadal team a pair of break points. The Americans erase the first, then the second, for deuce. But another overcooked forehand by Sock that leaves him wincing at the baseline gifts Federer and Nadal a third look at a break point. The European team can\u2019t convert that one, either: Federer badly frames a return from outside the court. From there Sock and Tiafoe get out with the hold thanks to some deft net play.\n\n\n\n\n 11.09pm  \n\nSock/Tiafoe break in third game of second set!\nSecond set: Federer/Nadal 6-4, 1-2 Sock/Tiafoe* (*denotes next server)\nSuddenly an opening for Sock and Tiafoe. They win two quick points on Nadal\u2019s serve, then Tiafoe crushes a winner off the ground for love-40 and three break-point chances. Nadal brushes aside the first with a forehand winner early in a rally, then the second with a 115mph ace down the middle. But Sock/Tiafoe strike on the third when Sock pounces on a second serve and Federer\u2019s stab at the net sends the ball sailing past the baseline.\n\n\n\n 11.04pm  \n\nSecond set: *Federer/Nadal 6-4, 1-1 Sock/Tiafoe (*denotes next server)\nAnother pressure point for the American pair at 30-all on Tiafoe\u2019s racket. But the US Open semi-finalist serves his way out of trouble, rattling off two quick points including a sizzling ace out wide to escape with the hold.\n\n\n\n 11.03pm  \n\nSecond set: Federer/Nadal 6-4, 1-0 Sock/Tiafoe* (*denotes next server)\n\u201cYou got a little bit caught up in the hoopla,\u201d Team World captain John McEnroe tells Sock and Tiafoe during the setbreak. \u201cI mean, it\u2019s a beautiful thing but it\u2019s even more beautiful if you win it.\u201d Federer serves to open the set and it\u2019s an uncomplicated hold of serve to start things off.\n\n\n\n 10.55pm  \nFederer/Nadal win first set, 6-4!\n\nFederer/Nadal break in 10th game of first set!\nFirst set: Federer/Nadal 6-4 Sock/Tiafoe\nTiafoe goes down love-15 on his serve. He follows with another booming ace for 15-all, but a gorgeous inside-out winner by Nadal followed by an unforced error get Federer and Nadal to deuce on the Team World serve for the first time tonight. The first pressure point of the day for the American duo. And Nadal answers with a forehand volley winner at the net into the alleyway and Team Europe have their first break-point opportunity of the match only moments after facing down their first. And they convert it! Sock sends a fairly simply backhand folley into the net early in a rally and Federer/Nadal have the break and the opening set!\n\nUpdated at 11.00pm BST\n\n\n 10.50pm  \n\nFirst set: Federer/Nadal 5-4 Sock/Tiafoe* (*denotes next server)\nThe first pressure point of the match is on Nadal\u2019s racket at 4-4, 30-30. And a backhand unforced error makes it 30-40, giving Sock and Tiafoe the first break-point chance of the match for either side. But Federer and Nadal rattle off three quick points from there with the Swiss capping the hold with a sharply angled volley winner at the net.\n\n\n\n 10.46pm  \n\nFirst set: *Federer/Nadal 4-4 Sock/Tiafoe (*denotes next server)\nAnother drama-free hold for Sock and we\u2019re still on serve in the opener.\n\n\n\n 10.43pm  \n\nFirst set: Federer/Nadal 4-3 Sock/Tiafoe* (*denotes next server)\nChants of \u201cLet\u2019s go Roger, let\u2019s go!\u201d ring through the O2 Arena as Federer steps to the baseline for his second turn on serve. He\u2019s pressured a bit this time after an unforced error pushes it to 40-30, then a second serve. But Nadal bails them out with a volley at the net to nail down the hold. Says the Spaniard during the changeover: \u201cIt\u2019s unbelievable when you don\u2019t play doubles how slow you are on the net.\u201d\n\n\nUpdated at 10.46pm BST\n\n\n 10.39pm  \n\nFirst set: *Federer/Nadal 3-3 Sock/Tiafoe (*denotes next server)\nTiafoe breezes through another service game to keep pace with the Federer-Nadal pair. No real moments of danger in any of the six games so far.\n\n\n\n\n 10.34pm  \n\nFirst set: Federer/Nadal 3-2 Sock/Tiafoe* (*denotes next server)\nNadal holds for Team Europe. Federer has overcome some early nerves and is firmly in the match. Elsewhere, the newly minted world No 1 is among the worldwide TV audience of millions.\n\n\n\n\n 10.29pm  \n\nFirst set: *Federer/Nadal 2-2 Sock/Tiafoe (*denotes next server)\nA quick hold for Sock and all four players have held their opening service games.\n\n\n\n 10.26pm  \n\nFirst set: Federer/Nadal 2-1 Sock/Tiafoe* (*denotes next server)\nFederer holds comfortably in his opening service game, despite losing a point where he managed to hit the ball through this gap between the net and the net post. Even at 41, he\u2019s doing things we\u2019ve never seen before.\n\n\nUpdated at 10.44pm BST\n\n\n 10.20pm  \n\nFirst set: *Federer/Nadal 1-1 Sock/Tiafoe (*denotes next server)\nSock and Tiafoe cruise to a stress-free hold in their opening service game. Tiafoe, fresh off his inspired run to the US Open semi-finals which included a career-best win over Nadal in the fourth round, punctuates it with a booming ace.\n\nUpdated at 10.22pm BST\n\n\n 10.16pm  \n\nFirst set: Federer/Nadal 1-0 Sock/Tiafoe* (*denotes next server)\nNadal is first to serve and he opens with a double fault. The ball was called in but a Tiafoe challenge overturned it. Federer then hits a forehand volley winner at the net early in a rally for 15-all, prompting another ovation. It could be a long night at this rate. Nadal makes it 30-15 with a lunging backhand volley into the alleyway before holding after a couple of errors by the Sock/Tiafoe team. A tidy hold for the crowd favorites after the double fault to start.\n\n\n\n 10.09pm  \n\nFederer and Nadal have just emerged from the tunnel to an extended standing ovation at a jam-packed O2 Arena. They\u2019re trailed by Team Europe coach Bj\u00f6rn Borg. They\u2019ve now taken the court for their warm-up, trading shots with the American pair of Jack Sock and Frances Tiafoe (who shared a court with Nadal not so long ago).\nTwo minutes to go.\n\n\nUpdated at 10.11pm BST\n\n\n 10.03pm  \n\nThe tributes have poured in from all over the world in the eight days since Federer announced his retirement. The great German footballer Philipp Lahm added to the pile with this thoughtful column in today\u2019s Guardian.\n\nFederer\u2019s career path forms a stark contrast to the present. In times of professionalisation, young athletes are often treated like investments \u2013 especially in sports where there is a lot to earn, like tennis. At a young age, they are sent to academies and camps, which are talent factories. Athletes\u2019 biographies are increasingly created outside the federation, outside society. They are privatised.\nThe entertainment industry of sport sees talent as a resource and a capital investment. As soon as it has identified the talent, it becomes a project. You take it out of the structures, do your own thing. The goal of the athlete is no longer to give something back to the community, but to optimise profit and build a business.\nBecause more and more people imitate this, many end up falling by the wayside. Talent is a rare gift. This is how sport distances itself from society. If it is no longer part of it, it loses its charm and credibility.\nOn Friday, the world can marvel at the genius of Federer one last time. It\u2019s time to get nostalgic. Many Federer moments come to mind. I often think of the spring of 2017, when he experienced a resurgence after many injuries. He won Indian Wells and Miami. In Australia he beat Nadal in the fifth set despite being behind.\nIt was the time when I ended my career. I was happy that Federer continued and I watched all his matches then \u2013 it was a wonderful pastime. He proved his prowess to everyone again. That\u2019s how I will remember Roger Federer.\n\n\nFederer and Nadal alternated between their courtside dugout with the rest of their Team Europe team-mates and backstage during the Murray-De Minaur match. \n\nNot much longer now. The players should be on court for tonight\u2019s feature attraction momentarily.\n\n\n\n 9.52pm  \n\nAlex de Minaur has won 5-7, 6-3, 7-10 over Andy Murray in a first-to-10 match tiebreak. A bit of a slow starter, but it featured some very high quality over the last half hour. In fighting back from a set down, the 23-year-old Aussie has delivered a desperately needed point for Team World, who did not want to fall into a 3-0 hole right out of the gate.\n\n\n\n\n 9.37pm  \n\nA quick refresher on the Laver Cup format and where things stand ahead of tonight\u2019s nightcap. A team-based, three-day event conceived as an equivalent to golf\u2019s Ryder Cup, the competition consists of three singles and one doubles match daily. One point is awarded per win on day one, two points per win on day two and three points per win on day three.\nTeam Europe have won all four editions so far, though the title was decided in the 12th and final match on two occasions. Federer clinched the trophy in 2017 and Alexander Zverev did the same in 2019.\nThe Europeans are already out to a 2-0 lead in this year\u2019s event after Casper Ruud and Stefanos Tsitsipas pocketed singles wins in today\u2019s afternoon session over Jack Sock and Diego Schwartzman, respectively.\n\nFederer, Nadal and Novak Djokovic are all playing on Team Europe together for the first time. The Big Three, as they are widely known, have combined to win 63 of the last 77 grand slam championships (Nadal 22, Djokovic 21, Federer 20).\nDe Minaur has just taken the second set in his ongoing match with Murray. Under the rules, the match will be decided by a 10-point tiebreaker rather than a full third set, meaning tonight\u2019s main event should be off and running by the top of the hour.\n\nUpdated at 10.05pm BST\n\n\n 9.25pm  \nPrelude\n\nHello and welcome to the O2 Arena for the final match of Roger Federer\u2019s storied career. The 41-year-old Swiss great, who hasn\u2019t competed since a quarter-final loss at Wimbledon to Hubert Hurkacz in July 2021, announced last week that he\u2019s walking away from professional tennis following a series of operations on his right knee that made his long-sought comeback to the men\u2019s tour untenable.\nAnd so he\u2019s bidding farewell tonight in London at the team event founded by his management company alongside his longtime rival and friend Rafael Nadal. The twosome are due to compete for Team Europe against the Team World doubles pairing of Frances Tiafoe and Jack Sock.\nIt\u2019s not the first time Federer and Nadal have featured on the same side of the court: they won a doubles match together in the first edition of the Laver Cup back in 2017. But they are far better known for their roles in one of the great rivalries in the history of sport. They\u2019ve met a total of 40 times in singles (with Nadal winning 26), including 14 times at grand slam tournaments (with the Spaniard winning 10), none more memorable than their epochal showdown in the 2008 Wimbledon final.\n\u201cI saw him playing on TV before I arrived on tour. I saw him having success on TV, and then (we were) able to create an amazing rivalry together,\u201d Nadal said yesterday. \u201cAnd on the other hand, something that probably we are very proud of is having a friendly rivalry. Tomorrow is going to be a special thing. Difficult. Going to be difficult to handle everything, especially for Roger, without a doubt. But for me, too. At the end, one of the most important players \u2013 if not the most important player \u2013 in my tennis career is leaving.\u201d\n\nFederer and Nadal will take the court after the conclusion of the night\u2019s first fixture, a singles meeting between Team Europe\u2019s Andy Murray and Team World\u2019s Alex de Minaur that\u2019s currently in the second set.\n\n\n\n 9.15pm  \n\nBryan will be here shortly. In the meantime here\u2019s Tumaini Carayol\u2019s lookahead to Federer\u2019s swansong tonight in London.\n\nRoger Federer, Rafael Nadal, Novak Djokovic and Andy Murray \u2013 a group of the three greatest men\u2019s tennis players of all time and the four defining competitors of the generation \u2013 were packed tightly together for their Laver Cup press conference on Thursday, when they all converged for the final time as professionals.\nAs they reminisced on their old matches and laughed about shared memories, glorious or devastating depending on the perspective, Federer interjected: \u201cSitting here, it feels good that I go first from the guys,\u201d he said, smiling. \u201cIt just feels right.\u201d\nIn many ways this final chapter of Federer\u2019s career is bleak. Despite his reputation for avoiding serious injury through his career, his final years have been ravaged by physical problems. Unlike the recent intense, competitive departure of Serena Williams Federer cannot trust his knee to last more than one short doubles match. In his final bout alongside Nadal, his Team Europe teammate, he will enter the O2 Arena against Team World\u2019s Frances Tiafoe and Jack Sock on Friday night simply hoping to compete at a respectable level.\nBut the circumstances are fitting. He will be seen off by three of the toughest opponents of his life, players who with him have defined this past decade and a half of tennis, pushing it forward in so many ways. Between them they have won 66 grand slam titles, faced off against each other 234 times and spent 933 weeks at No 1. For over a decade they packed out the later stages of each major event and blocked nearly all others from succeeding.\n\u201cTomorrow\u2019s gonna be a special thing,\u201d said Nadal. \u201cI think very difficult, difficult one. Gonna be difficult to handle everything, especially for Roger, without a doubt. For me too. At the end one of the most important players, if not most important player in my tennis career, is leaving, no?\u201d\n\n\n\n"

                    "body": "Less than a year ago, New Zealand felt yet another global trophy slip from their grasp as Australia mowed down a decent chase of 173 without breaking a sweat in the 2021 final. To start this year\u2019s T20 World Cup, the Kiwis laid into Australia with an extra level of ferocity, racking up 200 for the cost of only three wickets before defending it with aplomb. Holding the chase to just 111 closed out the first upset of the Super 12 stage and put a severe dent in the home team\u2019s tournament plans. It was the young opener Finn Allen who introduced the cat to Australian pigeons. Facing up to Patrick Cummins, Mitchell Starc and Josh Hazlewood would be an intimidating option for any Test opener, but Allen took on all of them within the first three overs. He took Starc down the ground, Hazlewood through cover, and Cummins over square leg. After facing 13 of the 18 balls bowled, he had 35 runs and New Zealand had 46. Another monster straight hit off Marcus Stoinis took Allen to 42 from 16 balls by the time Hazlewood hit his stumps.  The performance wasn\u2019t entirely surprising, given Allen\u2019s exploits in the shortest format across Australia and England. He currently scores at 166.99 per hundred balls in T20 Internationals, and 171.57 across all T20 cricket. That leaves him fifth-highest in history on both lists with a minimum of 250 balls faced. In all T20s, nobody who has faced 400 balls has scored higher than Allen, who has faced 1,189. He is the most consistently fast scorer in the world and has the chance to carry New Zealand a long way in the tournament. That gave Devon Conway the perfect start and he carried it through the innings with a peerless 92 from 58 balls. He produced inventive glides and a series of perfectly placed drives against the fast bowlers, while repeatedly targeting leg-spinner Adam Zampa for big hits down the ground. \u201cIt was pretty special,\u201d said Conway after the match. \u201cI\u2019ve seen [Allen] do it time and time again. He\u2019s fearless, and credit has to go to him. The way Finn plays his game complements my game, I knew that I could just play my game and bat around him.\u201d  Zampa foxed the New Zealand captain, Kane Williamson, with a loopy delivery that hit him in front of the stumps for 23, and Hazlewood took a top edge from Glenn Phillips (12 runs) and completed the catch, but that didn\u2019t slow down Conway. James Neesham also played his part to perfection with four overs to play, battering 26 from 13 balls including a six from the final ball of the innings. Australia generally fancy chasing big totals, but it has to start from the top. David Warner edged Trent Boult for a boundary before deflecting a Tim Southee delivery onto his stumps having scored just five runs. Aaron Finch and Mitchell Marsh threatened for a moment, Finch sending Southee soaring over the leg side and Marsh scoring six of his own over extra cover from Mitchell Santner. But New Zealand\u2019s left-arm spinner had Finch (13) caught at cover in the same over, then Marsh (16) lifted Southee to Neesham at deep midwicket.  That left the job up to Stoinis and Glenn Maxwell, who were tied down by a furiously fast over from Lockie Ferguson and an accurate one from Santner. Another piece of New Zealand brilliance knocked out Stoinis, caught at deep cover by an airborne Phillips who was up and celebrating almost as soon as his flight path had intersected with the ground. That left Australia needing 150 from 70 balls. Tim David fetched one six off Santner from outside off-stump before perishing trying to replicate it, and while Maxwell set about lashing 28 runs in quick time, including turning himself into a left-hander to lever Ish Sodhi into the second tier of the grandstand, Matthew Wade soon edged Ferguson behind and the game was gone. Boult and Southee cleaned up the tail, Boult finishing with two for 24 from his full allotment, while Southee claimed an absurd three for six from 13 deliveries. Santner was the most expensive with three for 31, while Ferguson and Sodhi each took a wicket. Of Australia\u2019s bowling, conversely, the most economical was Starc at nine runs per over. In a group stage where only two teams will progress to the knockout phase, New Zealand now have the upper hand, and Australia finding a way to beat the English favourites is now vital."

                    "body": "A mere 2,155 days after the US women\u2019s soccer team filed a complaint with the USA\u2019s Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and 1,082 days since the team filed a lawsuit against US Soccer, the team and the federation announced a settlement on Tuesday. Unusually for legal action, the terms of the settlement were immediately made public: $24m, with $2m of that money earmarked for \u201cUSWNT players in their post-career goals and charitable efforts related to women\u2019s and girls\u2019 soccer.\u201d Now comes the hard part.  The deal is contingent on the ratification of a new contract between the federation and the players. That new contract is tied up in part because US Soccer president Cindy Cone has insisted that the men\u2019s and women\u2019s national teams come together with the federation to figure out the pesky problem of how to pay both national teams equally when Fifa\u2019s prize money for World Cups is hugely unequal \u2013 $440m for the men in 2022 against a proposed $60m for the women in 2023.  On a related note, all parties that take women\u2019s soccer seriously would very much like Fifa to even out that prize money. Today. Yesterday. It\u2019s money Fifa could afford to, considering the organization made around $3.5bn in profit from the 2018 World Cup alone. \u201cWe\u2019re not wondering if the women\u2019s game can make money,\u201d Megan Rapinoe said of Fifa on a Tuesday conference call. \u201cIt\u2019s just willful discrimination and willful negligence.\u201d Since 2018, the US men have been playing under the terms of an expired collective bargaining agreement. The women agreed in December to extend their current deal through March.   Players on Tuesday\u2019s conference call said they\u2019ve been working with the men\u2019s team on CBA talks, and Becky Sauerbrunn noted that lawyers have been coming up with creative proposals. But representatives for the men\u2019s players association did not return a request for comment from the Guardian, nor has the association posted anything on its Twitter feed, which instead focused on the match-up of two USMNT stars in the Champions League tie between Chelsea (Christian Pulisic) and Lille (Timothy Weah).  The lawsuit settlement seems rather generous given the team\u2019s losses in court. Last year, US district judge R Gary Klausner granted a partial summary judgment in favor of the federation, accepting the argument that the women had actually been paid more than the men, albeit in a cycle in which the World Cup champion women were considerably more successful than their male counterparts, who failed to qualify for the 2018 World Cup.  A more damning argument: In their 2017 collective bargaining agreement, the women had accepted not just a different pay scale but a completely different structure. Given the lack of professional opportunities throughout most of women\u2019s soccer\u2019s history, the federation has long paid salaries and benefits to most of the team\u2019s most frequent players. Klausner wrote that the women\u2019s team rejected an offer to go to the men\u2019s \u201cpay-to-play\u201d structure and therefore couldn\u2019t \u201cretroactively deem their CBA worse.\u201d And even if the men and women manage to coordinate on their CBAs, the teams will still have some differences. Sauerbrunn said on Tuesday that the team still wants to negotiate issues such as maternity leave, which will be tricky as coach Vlatko Andonovski expands the player pool rather than following the precedent of sticking with the same faces. On the other hand, from the federation\u2019s point of view, $24m is certainly less than $67m, the figure cited by an economist filing a brief on behalf of the women\u2019s team. Cone, herself a longtime player for the national team, argued that such a payout \u201cwould likely bankrupt the federation.\u201d That dramatic statement might not be literally true. The pandemic and other factors brought the federation\u2019s spending plans to a screeching halt and, paradoxically, resulted in a surplus in the fiscal year ending March 2021. The federation, which had previously planned to spend that pile of assets down to $42m by March 2023, is now targeting $102m by that date. But the federation has a lot on its plate, not the least of which is building up national teams that have either aged (women) or underachieved (men). Since landing a $50m windfall with the hosting of the Copa America Centenario in 2016, US Soccer has been under pressure to invest in many areas \u2013 coaching education, extended national teams (disability soccer, beach soccer, futsal), the US Open Cup (including a new competition for women) and grassroots grants programs.  The settlement also surely removes a sizable chunk of legal fees from the budget, though the federation still faces interminable lawsuits from the NASL and sports promoter Relevent Sports \u2013 both represented by Jeffrey Kessler, who also represents the US women and once represented MLS players in an ill-fated legal action against the league and federation. Also still suing the federation \u2013 Hope Solo, the longtime US women\u2019s goalkeeper who wound up going her own way in court. Perhaps most important of all for the federation is a rare bit of good PR, or at least an interruption in the drumbeat of bad PR. The women found little trouble attracting sympathetic reporters, influencers and documentarians who eschewed numbers and even touted \u201cequal pay\u201d deals in other countries that are, in fact, not equal and pay both men and women considerably less than US Soccer does.  \u201cManagement,\u201d even when it\u2019s a volunteer-driven nonprofit, is never the popular side in a labor dispute. The federation\u2019s former legal team and former president Carlos Cordeiro took that bad hand and made it worse. Cordeiro was tone-deaf in public statements, even at a parade for the women after their 2019 championship. The legal team argued that women lacked not just the speed and strength of men\u2019s players but also the skill and effort, an argument that was all the more insulting because it was hardly necessary, given the strength of the federation\u2019s other arguments. Cordeiro is running again for his old gig, and Rapinoe noted on Tuesday\u2019s call that he didn\u2019t have her vote. She doesn\u2019t officially have a vote, but Sauerbrunn and Morgan do, along with several recent national team players who are part of the Athletes Council. The settlement surely bolsters Cone\u2019s case for re-election. But she still has to deal with negotiations with men\u2019s and women\u2019s players who have grown accustomed to being paid more than their peers. Cone is hopeful things will be nailed down before the women\u2019s extension expires on 31 March. \u201cAre we close?\u201d Cone said on Tuesday\u2019s call. \u201cIt depends on your definition of close. Are we going in the right direction? Yes.\u201d"

                    "body": "After two years of trauma, it would be an exaggeration to say Melbourne is back to normal. Streets are peppered with For Lease signs and reminders of what was lost to the pandemic (loved ones, livelihoods, favourite local haunts). But one industry is unquestionably booming. From excited crowds trekking to regional grounds to watch women\u2019s footy to bitter rivalries over the willow at the \u2019G, spectator sport is back with a vengeance. Sending the AFL on a Queensland holiday doesn\u2019t seem to have affected our desire to get amongst it one bit, with the grand final between Geelong and Sydney attracting the largest crowd in decades. Meanwhile, more than 90,000 people descended on the MCG to watch a match for the ages between Pakistan and India as part of the ICC T20 World Cup.   Even the Formula 1, which has been troubled by low ticket numbers and alienating people who aren\u2019t models and/or billionaires, attracted record numbers earlier in the year. Australian Open crowds were rowdy and antisocial, sure, but they were plentiful, and they didn\u2019t euthanise any living creatures to my knowledge. Which brings us to Tuesday, and the annual pilgrimage to the David Jones millinery department followed by a quick trip to Flemington to lose your shoes. When the Maribyrnong River broke its banks a few weeks ago, swamping neighbourhoods with rising brown water, Flemington Racecourse gleamed emerald behind its flood wall. It\u2019s the most recent reminder of horse racing\u2019s gross chokehold on this otherwise quite good city, but far from the only. As if we needed another reason to turn our attention away from the Cup. As if it hasn\u2019t alienated itself enough with its wake of rubbish, predatory gambling and a race that too often ends with a horse hidden behind a curtain.  Melburnians had been voting with their feet \u2013 Cup attendance numbers declined 26% from 2010 to 2019. TV ratings have also plunged to record lows, as public sentiment on animal cruelty, predatory gambling ads and violence plummets. Why wouldn\u2019t we demand better? This is Melbourne, friends. The sporting capital of the world, where conversations must begin \u201cWhat school did you go to?\u201d and \u201cWhat team do you go for?\u201d. A city still mourning Shane Warne \u2013 heck, a city still mourning Peter Brock \u2013 but that can\u2019t remember the names of horses that died in seven of the past eight Melbourne Cups. We are flush with chances to witness victories, to battle for the underdog, to cheer for the winner, to rush the field, to bring oranges at half-time, to sing the club song, to spray another rich man with champagne on a podium. It runs in our blood and, to absolutely whip the analogy to death, it gets to go home to the stables afterwards. In a city where sport is religion and seasons are determined by the shape of the ball, surely we can find something better to watch than the final moments of a beautiful animal bred for profit?"

Russian deputy foreign minister, Sergei Ryabkov, said that Moscow viewed US military aid to Ukraine \u201cextremely negatively\u201d. \u201cAttempts to present the decision as containing an element of \u2018self-restraint\u2019 are useless,\u201d Ryabkov said. \u201cThe fact that the United States, at the head of a group of states, is engaged in a purposeful pumping of weapons into the Kyiv regime is an obvious thing.\u201d US President Joe Biden has confirmed he will send the more advanced, longer-range rocket systems to Kyiv, a critical weapon that Ukrainian leaders have been asking for as they struggle to stall Russian progress in the Donbas region. The medium-range high mobility artillery rocket systems are part of a new $700m tranche of security assistance from the US. Serhiy Haidai, Ukraine\u2019s governor of Luhansk, has said that Russia now controls 70% of the city of Sievierodonetsk, which is the main crucible of Russia\u2019s attack at the present time, and a key objective if Russian forces are to control the whole of the Donbas region. Haidai posted to Telegram claiming that \u201cthe Russians control 70% of Sievierodonetsk. Ukrainian troops retreated to more advantageous, pre-prepared positions. Another part continues fighting inside the city.\u201d President Zelenskiy has blasted the \u201cmadness\u201d of bombing a chemical plant in Sievierodonetsk. \u201cGiven the presence of large-scale chemical production in Sievierodonetsk, the Russian army\u2019s strikes there, including blind air bombing, are just crazy.\u201d Local officials said a nitric acid tank was hit and posted images of pink smoke billowing. Zelenskiy said Ukraine\u2019s military forces have had some successes near Kherson and in parts of the Kharkiv region. The UK\u2019s ministry of defence latest assessment of the situation on the ground in Ukraine says: \u201cRussian ground operations remain tightly focused, with the weight of fire power concentrated within a small sector of Luhansk oblast. Over 30-31 May, fighting intensified in the streets of Sievierodonetsk, with Russian forces pushing closer to the town centre. Over half of the town is likely now occupied by Russian forces, including Chechen fighters. Beyond the Donbas, Russia continues to conduct long-range missile strikes against infrastructure across Ukraine.\u201d Overnight a video depicting children alleged to have been killed by Ukrainian forces in the Russian-occupied Donbas region of Ukraine was projected on to the US embassy in Moscow as part of a protest to coincide with International Children\u2019s Day. Germany will supply Ukraine with the IRIS-T air defence system, chancellor Olaf Scholz said, following pleas from Kyiv and German opposition parties to step up heavy weapons deliveries. Switzerland\u2019s government has vetoed Denmark\u2019s request to send Swiss-made armoured personnel carriers to Ukraine. Denmark votes today in a referendum asking the nation whether it wants to end its decades-long opt-out from common European Union defence policies. Denmark\u2019s foreign minister, Jeppe Kofod, has said he will ask parliament tomorrow for Denmark\u2019s support of the accession of Sweden and Finland to Nato. Ukraine is working on an international UN-led operation with naval partners to ensure a safe trade route for food exports, according to Ukraine\u2019s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, who said Russia was playing \u201chunger games with the world by blocking Ukrainian food exports\u201d. Pope Francis appealed to authorities to lift the block on wheat exports from Ukraine, saying the grain cannot be used as a \u201cweapon of war\u201d. The African Union warned EU leaders that Moscow\u2019s blockade of Ukraine\u2019s ports risked \u201ca catastrophic scenario\u201d of food shortages and price rises. Senegal\u2019s president, Macky Sall, who chairs the union, said \u201cthe worst is perhaps ahead of us\u201d if current global food supply trends continued. Ukraine would prosecute 80 suspected war criminals, said the prosecutor general, Iryna Venediktova. Representatives of a group of countries investigating Russian war crimes have met with the international criminal court prosecutor, Karim Khan, at The Hague. A senior Russian lawmaker has suggested kidnapping a Nato defence minister. Oleg Morozov from the United Russia party said on Rossiya-1 state TV he had a \u201cfantastical plot\u201d that a Nato war minister would travel to Kyiv and wake up in Moscow. Sanctions against Russia are directed at ordinary citizens and motivated by hatred, the former president, Dmitry Medvedev, has said. Medvedev, who advises Vladimir Putin on national security, said on Telegram that the \u201cendless tango of economic sanctions\u201d won\u2019t touch the political elite but have brought losses for big business. Russia has further cut off gas supplies to Europe. Gazprom turned off the taps to a top Dutch trader and halted flows to some companies in Denmark and Germany. The intensification follows the EU\u2019s decision to place an embargo on most Russian oil imports. Ukraine\u2019s giant seed bank is in danger of being destroyed. The genetic code for nearly 2,000 crops rests in underground vaults based in Kharkiv, north-eastern Ukraine, which has come under intense bombing. Read more of the Guardian\u2019s coverage how vital seed banks are in the climate crisis here and here. Russia says it has has completed testing of its hypersonic Zircon cruise missile and will deploy it before the end of the year on a new frigate of its Northern Fleet. Ukraine will face Scotland tonight in what is set to be a highly-emotionally charged football match in Glasgow. The winners will play Wales on Sunday for the final berth at the 2022 Fifa World Cup in Qatar. "

                    "body": "CANADA HOME AND DRY To paraphrase one of Chris Rock\u2019s greatest jokes, Will Smith ain\u2019t go crazy last night at the Oscars; Will Smith went Will Smith. Quite the spontaneous contemporary dance routine, though, huh? Remember, kids, violence is never the answer, especially if it\u2019s going to subject everyone to a full week of hot takes, polarised op-eds and memes. Oh Will! How could you! The Fiver is also sad that the incident has instantly become the most famous and notorious on-stage hand-jaw-interface scenario in history, eclipsing that time Jerry Sadowitz took to the stage in Montreal and opened with \u201cI tell you why I hate Canada, half of you speak French, and the other half let them\u201d with predictable consequences. Sadowitz an acquired taste, to be fair. But that\u2019s not the only reason our thoughts have turned to the Canadians, and seeing you\u2019re asking, yes this does register the maximum 11 on our patented Tenuousconvolutedintro-o-meter\u2122. That\u2019s because on Sunday night, Canada\u2019s men made it to the World Cup finals for the first time since 1986 (which is coincidentally the last time anybody paid any attention to the Academy Awards). John Herdman\u2019s swashbuckling counter-attacking side guaranteed their place in Qatar with a 4-0 rout of Jamaica, the cheese curds and gravy on an already delicious plate of steaming-hot fries that represent wins in Mexico and the USA! USA!! USA!!! as well as that Alphonso Davies goal against Panama, a combination of such speed and grace that it knocks even the work of your Gareth Bales and Mo Salahs into a c0cked straw hat.  Davies is the star man, though most of the plaudits are heading in the direction of Herdman, who already has done more than his bit for Canadian football, having led the women to a couple of bronze-medal finishes at Big Sports Day, setting them on a trajectory that saw them win gold under his former assistant Bev Preistman last year. The men were long overdue a contribution and they\u2019ve finally made it, the win over Jamaica guaranteeing a top-three finish in the Concacaf table. Most likely they\u2019ll be joined later this week by Mexico, for whom a draw in their final match at home against El Salvador will do, and the US, who will make it unless they lose by six goals or more in Costa Rica. Let\u2019s face it, rather like that dust-up at the Oscars, it\u2019s all over bar the shouting (and tweeting, releasing of press statements, candid interviews with Oprah, etc). QUOTE OF THE DAY \u201cMy dream is to see Ukraine and its people smile again. As long as I have the energy and I\u2019m healthy I\u2019ll never stop\u201d \u2013 iconic Dynamo Kyiv manager Mircea Lucescu tells Emanuel Rosu about the shocking first morning of the war in Ukraine, helping players get to Romania and his dream to lead his club again.

                    "body": "The owner of the Costcutter chain and one of the UK\u2019s largest grocery wholesalers has taken a near-\u00a3200m stake in Sainsbury\u2019s and said it could increase its position further. The company, which describes itself as the UK\u2019s seventh-largest family owned business with a turnover of \u00a34.5bn, has bought almost 81m shares, giving it a 3.45% stake in the UK\u2019s second-largest supermarket. However, the group said it intended to hold its shares in Sainsbury\u2019s \u201cfor investment purposes\u201d and added that it looked forward to \u201csupporting the executive management team\u201d.  Bestway said it \u201cmay look\u201d at purchasing more shares in the grocer, but this would be \u201csubject to availability and price\u201d. It said it was not considering making a takeover bid for Sainsbury\u2019s \u2013 a statement that bars it from such a move for six months, unless a rival bid emerges, under Takeover Panel rules. The move makes Bestway the sixth-largest shareholder in Sainsbury\u2019s. Alongside its wholesale business, Bestway owns the UK\u2019s third-largest pharmacy chain, Well Pharmacy, and more than 2,700 convenience stores under the Costcutter and Best-one brands. Bestway did not disclose how much it paid for the stake. However, at Sainsbury\u2019s closing price on Thursday of 239.4p, the stake was valued at \u00a3193m. Shares in Sainsbury\u2019s rose by as much as 4.5% on Friday, taking them to 250p, making the company one of the top risers on the FTSE 100. Sainsbury\u2019s said in a statement that it would \u201cengage with Bestway Group in line with our normal interactions with shareholders.\u201d Clive Black, an analyst at Shore Capital, said it was not clear if Bestway had \u201cthe aspirations or the resources\u201d to bid for Sainsbury\u2019s or whether, as a major grocery wholesaler and pharmacy business, it wanted to \u201ccollaborate with Sainsbury\u2019s from a trading perspective.\u201d Black said he was particularly surprised by Bestway\u2019s statement that it was potentially interested in buying more Sainsbury\u2019s shares. \u201cI\u2019ve been around a long time and not seen anything like this before. It\u2019s like saying \u2018here\u2019s a phone number, give us a ring\u2019,\u201d he said. Maureen Hinton, an independent retail analyst, said Bestway\u2019s stake could give it leverage in potential negotiations over the future of pharmacy outlets in Sainsbury\u2019s after the supermarket chain\u2019s current partner Lloyds Pharmacy announced plans to close all 237 outlets. \u201c[Bestway\u2019s] Well Pharmacy business would be a possible replacement for the Lloyds pharmacy exit,\u201d she said in a tweet. Sainsbury\u2019s already has two major shareholders on its register who might be interested in backing a privatisation \u2013 the Qatar Investment Authority, which owns just over 14% of the shares, and the billionaire Daniel K\u0159et\u00ednsk\u00fd, known as the \u201cCzech Sphinx\u201d, who holds about 10%. Any deal would need their blessing. Bestway\u2019s move is considered by some as demonstrating ongoing investor takeover interest in UK supermarkets, after the \u00a37bn takeover of Morrisons by the US private equity firm Clayton Dubilier &amp; Rice in late 2021, and the sale of Asda by the US retailer Walmart to the billionaire Issa brothers and the private equity firm TDR Capital. Sainsbury\u2019s currently has a 15.7% share of the UK grocery market, according to retail analysts Kantar, and recently reported successful Christmas trading, where its sales grew 7% from a year earlier. The retailer said it had benefited from customers splashing out on Christmas dinner, as well as strong sales at the Argos chain it owns. Bestway was founded in 1976 as a wholesale supplier by Sir Anwar Pervez, which the 87-year-old billionaire still chairs, and has become one of Britain\u2019s biggest wholesalers, serving thousands of retailers. The company can trace its origins back even further, to the convenience store Kashmir opened by Pervez in Earl\u2019s Court, west London, in 1963, just a few years after he left his native Pakistan for Britain, going on to carry out a range of jobs including as a bus conductor in Bradford. Bestway also owns the Well Pharmacy chain, which it bought from the Co-op in 2014. The company employs 28,000 people across the UK, the Middle East and Pakistan, where it has a stake in one of the country\u2019s largest banks and its second-biggest cement manufacturer. "

The Norwegian\u2019s opener in Thursday\u2019s 3-2 Carabao Cup win over Liverpool was his 24th strike in 19 appearances in all competitions this season. His total career tally is approaching 200.  De Bruyne said: \u201cErling is so obsessed with goals. He already has about 200 goals, so he can probably go to 600, 700 or 800 if he stays fit and does the things that he does. Erling is a top-level striker. I don\u2019t see Erling as different to a lot of people. He is a normal football player like everybody else and he doesn\u2019t take himself too seriously. \u201cWhen you talk about professional footballers or professional athletes, everybody has that little edge. I don\u2019t think you can become a professional player if you don\u2019t have that little something to become the best version you can be.  \u201cHe is still a young boy enjoying his life and he takes his football very seriously. He loves scoring goals, so I think that is the most unique thing he has.\u201d De Bruyne is highly admired by Pep Guardiola, the manager describing him as one of the greatest ever City players after the Liverpool victory. The Belgian offered a similar sentiment, stating that his manager is a genius.  \u201cI have been with him for so long, so I can understand when he changes things [in a game],\u201d the midfielder said. \u201cIt is just the way that he sees football, his football philosophy, which is to get the ball as much as possible and play good football with it. He wants to achieve that as much as possible in the game. He will be a genius in one sort of way because otherwise he wouldn\u2019t have changed football as much as he did. The way that he plays football, a lot of people do it now because of him and the Barcelona way, [Johan] Cruyff etc. It is like a chain. \u201cHe evolved it in a way that is important in football and a lot of teams are now pressing from the front, playing from the back, playing good football. He changed it in a lot of senses.\u201d De Bruyne also described Phil Foden as having a high potential. \u201cHe is probably one of the biggest talents that I have played with and his ceiling can be so high. He has already won four Premier Leagues and he is 22,\u201d De Bruyne said. \u201cHe is very smart as a player. Where there are a lot of tactics, you still have that guy who has that little bit of magic and he is one of these guys who has that magic so he can just do a lot of different stuff.

                    "body": "  9.34pm    Here is Andy Hunter\u2019s match report.      9.09pm    We will see no postgame comments on Fox. Pity. I\u2019d love to hear from Herdman right now.  So to recap:   Canada dominated play but misfired on too many chances Courtois made two exceptional saves Belgium scored an outstanding goal VAR had a shocking miss that could\u2019ve given Canada another early penalty Canadian universities are not colleges There is such a thing as a \u201cDrake curse\u201d  I\u2019ll be here for Canada\u2019s next game, a 4-1 victory unless that \u201cDrake curse\u201d is worse than I thought. See you then.     9.05pm    And another stat. Well, two, one involving a Canadian musician who is neither Geddy Lee nor Sarah McLachlan:       9.03pm    And the master statman adds:       9.03pm    Fox\u2019s lightning-rod commentator comments:       9.02pm    Email check before adding more postgame info:  Travis Giblin: \u201cI never thought I\u2019d see the day where a Casey Scheidigger reference was in place AND received by the readership. For those who didn\u2019t get the reference she\u2019s a skip for a successful curling team out of Alberta.\u201d I missed the opening game of this Cup because I was running a bonspiel. True story. Tim Smith: \u201cIs this stadium at altitude? I\u2019d always assumed that Qatar was flat but not sure I can recall so many wayward shots being ballooned over the goals.\u201d I think it\u2019s what is often called a rush of blood to the head. Ove Nilsson asks that I mention the player coming out in a substitution as well as the player coming on. I thought I did?     8.59pm   FULL TIME: Belgium 1-0 Canada  Let\u2019s be fair \u2013 Belgium had the three best plays in this game: a superbly taken goal on a Route One pass, Courtois\u2019 penalty save, and Courtois\u2019 save on the Larin header. And Canada\u2019s inexperience on this stage showed. Davies took a nervous penalty. A lot of shots were squandered. But then let\u2019s sum it up \u2013 Canada was by far the better team here against the obvious group favorites. And they have a solid case that they were robbed of a second penalty chance early in the game that would\u2019ve drastically changed the course of things. That bodes well for the rest of the group stage, at least. Does anyone doubt Canada can beat Croatia or Morocco?    Updated at 9.07pm GMT    8.56pm    90 +5 min: Miller is down in some discomfort.  Ball floats to Borjan all alone, and this time, he just tosses it to a teammate. And \u2026 the ref blows for full time? Not even a second of additional stoppage time?     8.55pm    90 +4 min: Belgium takes about 20 minutes to take a throw-in, which will hopefully prolong our stoppage time, if this ref is following the new directives on the matter. Ball deflects to Borjan, who punts it \u2026 to Courtois.     8.54pm    90 +3 min: Millar gets into the box and tries to cross back through a thicket of Belgium defenders. I don\u2019t see it happening at this point.     8.53pm    90 min: We\u2019ll get five minutes of stoppage time as Belgium earns a corner that will eat a bit of that. Ingo Herzke argues with the BBC: \u201cKeith Barrett wrote about that incident: \u201cwith the replay showing that he won the ball, before the Canadian attacker subsequently hit the deck.\u201d That is a VERY one-sided view, I\u2019d say; the Belgian defender just brushed the ball with his big toe before stamping Buchanan with his studs. Ridiculous. And Witsel\u2019s foul was very obvious as well. Canada wuz robbed!\u201d So there. A clever short corner from Belgium leads to a rather tame shot in the end. Borjan makes only his second save of the game, neither of them difficult. He\u2019s an outstanding keeper, as you\u2019d know if you watched CONCACAF qualifiers.     8.51pm    89 min: Attack down the left, a glimmer of space, and Belgium has to block a Canadian cross for a corner. The crowd is up \u2026 \u2026 and the kick almost lands on the opposite sideline. (Or \u201calmost goes into touch on the fly.\u201d)     8.50pm    88 min: Yet another half-chance for Canada. Michelle Peters-Jones: \u201cDon\u2019t be saying stuff about Alberta! Alphonso Davies is from Alberta! Currently the only bright light in our Alberta\u2019s lives!\u201d Hey, there\u2019s also Casey Scheiddegger, isn\u2019t there?     8.48pm    86 min: Oh, another Canadian chance! Larin has space as the cross comes in, but he mistimes his jump and sends his header high. Michael Goulborn says Bermuda would have to put up goals on a golf course. There was actually a decent player for the Baltimore Blast indoor team from Bermuda \u2013 David Bascome, maybe?     8.47pm    86 min: Now it\u2019s De Bruyne solidly in possession, but his shot is nowhere near the target.      8.46pm    83 min: Now THAT is a yellow card, as Alistair Johnston raises to catch the fresh-legged sub Openda and slides through him.  John Davis: \u201cCheers for the cracking MBM. This seems to be the definition of a \u2018played badly but ground out the three points\u2019 match from Belgium. You\u2019d praise a top four Premier League team for it. Gutted for Canada though - they\u2019ve deserved something.\u201d Hey, it\u2019s not over yet! Is it? Tim Hoult mentions the North American singular verb tense. I tend to go back and forth as I ponder whether to move to Europe. (Not too seriously. Well, maybe not.) After a delay to let Openda recover, the free kick results in a header well over the bar.  Updated at 8.56pm GMT    8.43pm    82 min: For those who track such things, Canada has outshot Belgium 20-5. They have, however, only put three on target. None better than the last one, even including the penalty.     8.43pm    80 min: WHAT A SAVE BY COURTOIS. The cross from Johnston is right on Larin\u2019s head, and the striker redirects it to the far post, only to see the outstanding Belgian keeper leap to his right and snare it with both hands.   Last roll of the dice: Osorio and Millar replace Buchanan and Eust\u00e1quio. The latter is an unfortunate loss. And now Davies has a yellow card. A bit \u2026 yeah, I\u2019m not a fan of this ref.  Updated at 8.57pm GMT    8.40pm    78 min: Batsuayi, the goal scorer who played in Lukaku\u2019s usual spot today, is departing. Openda is in. Kari Tulinius: \u201cI don\u2019t believe I\u2019ve ever seen center-back Steven de Souza Vitoria play before, but I\u2019ve already taken a liking to him. He\u2019s on the field to keep the ball far away from his goal and if that means launching the ball towards Saturn, then so be it. But he\u2019s also got proper route one passes in his locker and isn\u2019t afraid to try his luck.\u201d Andrew Benton corrects my spelling on Trossard and adds: \u201cI hope Canada are not deflating. They need as much flate as they can get in this match.\u201d I would say I\u2019m not overwhelmed by Belgium\u2019s performance here. At best, I\u2019m whelmed.     8.38pm    76 min: Ball is knocked away from Larin in the box. Buchanan appears to have taken a knock. Peter Oh writes to mention that, when it comes to Bermuda, we should watch for their passing triangles. Well played.     8.36pm    73 min: Long ball ahead to Larin, but Courtois is alert. Ken Clare: \u201cDon\u2019t you wish that Canadians would stop writing to explain Canada to you? Makes us all look like we all live in Alberta.\u201d I always enjoy seeing provincial curling championship broadcasts with so many ads for farm equipment. Sam Adekugbe comes in for Canada, replacing Laryea, and Fox\u2019s Cobi Jones (longtime US international) runs through a list of likely tactical changes that ensues.      8.33pm    71 min: I\u2019m trying to get through all the emails to distract myself from the increasing likelihood that this young, excellent Canadian squad isn\u2019t going to get the result they richly deserve. Michael Goulborn: \u201cI\u2019m not really a footie fan, but completely absorbed (from Bermuda) by your fantastic commentary. When I should be doing some work\u2026.. Keep up the good work!\u201d Bermuda, the next CONCACAF power? Keith Barrett: \u201cOn the incident in the 13th minute: the BBC coverage focused on this at half-time. The ball came off a Belgian defender and so wasn\u2019t offside. However, what followed was not a foul either: the Belgian defender made a clean tackle, with the replay showing that he won the ball, before the Canadian attacker subsequently hit the deck. So the ultimate decision (no penalty) was correct.\u201d Yeah, but the English think everything is a clean tackle. (Except for the fine folks at The Guardian.)     8.31pm    Peter Oh: \u201cThanks for the hockey reference. I would love to see a Canada shot beat Courtois five-hole.\u201d  (That\u2019s a nutmeg, in soccer terms. Through the legs.) Justin Madson: \u201cIn response to Steve\u2019s pedantry about the Jordan Rule, I also came across Jordan\u2019s Rule, which states \u201cgiven any species in any region, the nearest related species is not likely to be found in the same region nor in a remote region, but in a neighbouring district separated from the first by a barrier of some sort\u201d. I feel this gives us some insight as to why the referee seems to be different than the others calling matches so far, because he apparently is watching a different game than everyone else. On a separate note, to your credit \u201csuperstar\u201d calls in the NBA are alive and well, thanks to officiating acting as PR in that league. As everything is about PR with this World Cup, one might wonder...\u201d OK then \u2026     8.30pm    68 min: Belgium attacking now, to the point that Canada almost has a counter. You have to wonder if Canada is already starting to deflate. Brutally unlucky not to be up or at least tied at this stage.     8.29pm    67 min: A terrific chance for Belgium, but it\u2019s another heroic interception by a player who isn\u2019t identified because Fox is busy giving an update on some Harry Kane dude.   Updated at 8.35pm GMT    8.27pm    67 min: Richard hirst: \u201cLeft bank brings to mind an existentialist with a Gaulloises and a Ricard. Maybe that\u2019s Belgium\u2019s problem!\u201d Counter to Belgium, but a timely interception keeps De Bruyne from going to the races. Immediately back the other end, and Laryea sends a shot well wide.     8.26pm    65 min: Corner comes to nothing, and Dendoncker cynically grabs Buchanan to prevent a counter.     8.25pm    Peter Littley: \u201cThink the Canadian players have worked out if you fall down this referee will give the foul.\u201d That, and the Belgian subs are playing a tad negatively. Tossard, though, shows some class right away with a backheel that splits two defenders and ends up cleared for a corner.     8.24pm    63 min: Looks like the referee correctly played advantage after a badly mistimed tackle, and Canada gets a shot out of it. Unfortunately, it\u2019s to the misfiring Buchanan, whose shot will shortly land in the Persian Gulf.     8.23pm    61 min: We have to be fair here \u2013 Belgium is, obviously, full of talented players, and Eden Hazard just made a nifty move to keep an attack going on the sideline. Then Belgium promptly loses the ball, and it\u2019s all Canada again. And Hazard will come off \u2026 Leandro Tossard is in.     8.21pm    60 min: Meunier, the masked man already on a yellow, commits a needless foul. Free kick 30 yards out, and Eust\u00e1quio sends it too far to the far post.     8.21pm    On colleges and universities \u2026 JF Crepault: \u201cPlease tell Alison Curtis that her terminology comment is irrelevant as Tajon Buchanan attended *college* in the US :)\u201c Michael Platt: \u201cCan\u2019t speak for Vancouver but here at the University of Calgary, there is not a seat to be had in any of the student venues showing the game. Absolutely packed.\u201d     8.19pm    58 min: Canadian subs \u2026 Prolific scorer Cyle Larin replaces Hoilett. Isma\u00ebl Kon\u00e9, age 20, replaces Atiba Hutchinson, age 39.     8.18pm    56 min: YELLOW to Onana for reaching an arm back to swat Eust\u00e1quio in the face. So both Belgian subs already have cautions.   Updated at 8.31pm GMT    8.17pm    55 min: Pressure wins a Canadian corner, perhaps wrongly so. It comes to nothing. Padraig McAuliffe writes: \u201cSad to see Carrasco given the hook. His decade-long stint as a Belgium left-bank has been an inspiring battle against imposter syndrome that we can all take heart from.\u201d I\u2019m assuming that should be \u201cleft-back.\u201d Or not. What was his last transfer fee?     8.15pm    53 min: Yellow card to Meunier for a wayward arm to a face. It\u2019s as if the Belgian subs were sent in like ice hockey enforcers.  Yes, that\u2019s my second ice hockey reference today, but we are talking about Canada here. Now attempting to curl in the free kick, but it\u2019s through the house without any sweeping.  Updated at 8.28pm GMT    8.13pm    51 min: The Canadian press is back in full effect, and Courtois has two moments in which he needs to be very careful with his footwork as the ball is passed back to him. That brings the crowd back into it.     8.12pm    Steve Kochar writes: \u201cHey Beau, thanks for doing a great job with the MBM today! Just a note from back in minute 28... The \u201cJordan Rules\u201d was actually the name for the Detroit Pistons strategy for defending Jordan, when and where to send a double team, that sort of thing. He did get all the calls as well of course but that\u2019s just how the NBA works :) Sorry for the pedantry but that\u2019s what the MBM is for right!\u201d I think it referred to both the Pistons strategy and the NBA officiating, but I won\u2019t have a chance to look it up at this time while I\u2019m watching Canada squander more chances. 16-4 edge for Canada in attempts at goal.     8.10pm    48 min: CHANCE on a long cross from the superb Eust\u00e1quio. David puts his shot just wide.     8.10pm    47 min: The atmosphere died at the half. It\u2019s virtually silent.  Thomas Meunier has replaced Yannick Carrasco. Amadou Onana has replaced Youri Tielemans, and he immediately commits a silly foul that draws a stern lecture from our referee.      8.08pm    Emails, emails \u2026 Adam Paige: \u201cI wish more broadcasters would use the Elo rather than Fifa ranking since it\u2019s more predictive (Belgium &amp; Canada are 6th &amp; 29th in Elo but 2nd &amp; 41st in Fifa).\u201d Fair point. Michelle Peters-Jones: \u201cThe weather is lovely here, thank you. Not too cold, at least not as cold as the time the Canadian team played in the Commonwealth Stadium here and we had a lovely snow dive from Sam (Adekugbe). We also had a fun time cheering for our hometown hero, Alphonso (Davies). We even named a train station after him (not really, but one can dream). So hopefully we can beat them aging Belgians.\u201d I forgot to mention that I\u2019m actually a curler. And yet my cold tolerance is minimal, having grown up in Georgia. Julian Menz: \u201cA friend of mine is in downtown Vancouver, and reports that there was nary a fan or flag to be seen. It\u2019s early(ish) I know, but most countries would be absolutely COOKING by now! Would it help if it was the Stanley World Cup?\u201d Stephen Carr: \u201cEvening Beau. Not sure Martinez has what it takes to get a tune out of this team. He is, after all, the man who declared Tom Cleverley to be the \u2018most sensational free transfer in the history of the Premier League\u2019 when he signed him for Everton.....\u201d Martinez is a good TV commentator. Wondering if he should go back to that job. Alison Curtis: \u201cIn Canada we don\u2019t call universities \u201ccolleges\u201d. Please get your terminology right.\u201d Well, that spoils the John Belushi \u201cCOLLEGE\u201d T-shirt. Richard Hirst: \u201cWhat this game lends itself to is an analysis of the linguistic fissures within the teams. On the one hand Flemish/French/German(yes, a little known part of Belgium) and on the other English/French. Maybe at half time?\u201d Que? Matthew Carpenter-Arevalo: \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure that in the Disney retelling of Canada\u2019s world cup run, the coach, played by Robbie Williams, will say to the team in a motivational speech \u201cwe\u2019re going to play hockey, but on a pitch!\u201d\u201d I\u2019m picturing an exceptionally polite Ted Lasso. Matt Dony: \u201cIn lieu of any goals, I offer the following - Mentioning the great Sarah McLachlan, I recently discovered that Angel was written about Jonathan Melvoin, who died following an overdose while playing keyboards on tour for the Smashing Pumpkins. The quintessential funeral song, ubiquitous in emotional X-Factor auditions, was inspired, not by a close relative or dear friend, but by a news report of a relatively obscure touring musician passing away on the other side of the world. Now I\u2019m aware of this fact, I\u2019m sharing it far and wide.\u201d It\u2019s a fairly well-known story \u2013 though I say that as a McLachlan and Pumpkins fan \u2013 but worth repeating. Joseph Harvey: \u201cCollege soccer is pretty bad but it is good preparation for playing with awful referees who are apparently on hard drugs.\u201d Good point. Owen Harris uses a bad word on the 39th minute no-call. Karim Hadhoum: \u201cCanada, coming from behind is a la vogue. So take heart.\u201d What\u2019s really unfair here is knowing that Canada is absolutely capable of shifting gears. Given a 1-0 lead, Canada could\u2019ve slammed the door. And from Gorazd: \u201cI\u2019m surprised not much is being said about the situation in the 13th minute, when Canada was robbed. There was absolutely no offside, as the ball was passed back by Hazard. So the flag should never have been raised by the assistant, even worse was that the referee did not ignore it, as he saw everything play out. And then to make matters even worse, VAR did not intervene on what was a clear and obvious error by the referee and very likely a subsequent penalty for Canada. The first major refereeing error at the World Cup.\u201d Fox Sports went over it in some detail at the half, at least.  More complaining later. Game has restarted.     8.00pm    Revisiting an earlier play \u2013 Buchanan was called offside when Belgium clearly passed the ball back to Vertonghen, who then fouls Buchanan.  So Buchanan should not have been called offside. So Buchanan should\u2019ve earned a penalty. VAR apparently looked and \u2026 saw something different. That\u2019s shocking in the VAR era. Shocking.     7.54pm    Before you reach for the halftime oranges, please consider supporting Guardian journalism like this, for three reasons: \u2022 We are independent - no one tells us what we can and can\u2019t publish (and that includes Fifa) \u2022 We rely on readers funding us to keep us independent \u2022 We give you the full picture - the excitement on the pitch and the shame, corruption and injustice off it Support the Guardian from as little as \u00a31 \u2013 it only takes a minute. Thank you. I for one consider it a privilege to add my commentary (and, occasionally, an important piece of analysis on an off-field issue) to this outstanding news organization.     7.52pm   HALFTIME: Belgium 1-0 Canada  That\u2019s the most dominant half of play by a non-Mexican CONCACAF team since 2014, and they\u2019re down 1-0. Go figure. Belgium scored on its one solid chance. Canada squandered a penalty and a couple more chances, and give the old-timers in Belgium\u2019s defense some credit for scrambling to block a bunch of shots.     7.51pm    45 +4 min: A Canadian corner kick is deflected out to Eust\u00e1quio at the top of the box, and I pity whoever blocked that screamer. Looks like Tielemans. It hit his arms, but he had them tucked in front of his chest to prevent being leveled. Can\u2019t blame him there. That\u2019s Belgium\u2019s sixth blocked shot.     7.48pm    45 +2 min: CHANCE and it was easier for Buchanan to score than to NOT score, but he did the latter. Perfect ball in from Laryea. Buchanan pressured but with a chance to strike from six yards out, and he skies it over the ball. Er \u2026 bar.  Updated at 7.49pm GMT    7.47pm    45 +1 min: As predicted, five minutes of stoppage time.     7.46pm   GOAL! Belgium 1-0 Canada (Batshuayi 44)  \u201cAgainst the run of play\u201d is hardly sufficient. A direct ball, maybe 60 yards in the air straight up the field from Toby Alderweireld, lands at the feet of Michy Batshuayi, whose first touch is a fine finish.      Updated at 7.57pm GMT    7.43pm    42 min: Belgium lofts a ball far ahead \u2026 for no one. They\u2019ve been forced to play dump-and-chase like an aging and unskilled ice hockey team. But you just sense that if they can hold on another few minutes, they can regroup and turn it around. Given the stoppage time we\u2019ve seen at this Cup, I\u2019d expect no less than five minutes for the VAR checks.     7.41pm    40 min: Hutchinson and Hazard get tangled. That\u2019s a combined 70 years on this planet right there. Foul goes against Hutchinson, rightly so.     7.41pm    39 min: Mark Clattenburg, Fox\u2019s rules analyst, says the defender slowed down just enough to avoid being called here. And the VAR crew agrees. Ah well.     7.39pm    38 min: How is that not a penalty? Witsel bundles over Laryea from behind. He could call the push or the trip. He calls neither. Again, I\u2019m loathe to criticize referees, but this is a shambles. Hold up .. VAR is looking!   Updated at 7.48pm GMT    7.37pm    36 min: Canada slows it down for a bit. Davies then slips through the middle, but the possession goes nowhere.     7.36pm    35 min: Are we in Toronto?       7.33pm    32 min: Hoilett easily and cleanly wins a battle with Hazard, then pops the ball into the box for David, whose header doesn\u2019t quite trouble anyone.     7.32pm    31 min: Oh, but the youth shows sometimes! Eust\u00e1quio creates a chance for David, who easily could\u2019ve sent it to a teammate rushing down the right, but he shoots instead. Canada has outshot Belgium 11-2.  11-2!     7.31pm    30 min: Johnston gets into the box with the ball. He falls. No call, probably reasonably so. But the ball comes back to him, and his shot stings Courtois\u2019 gloves. Canada truly deserve a goal here. They\u2019ve taken it to an accomplished team.     7.29pm    28 min: Witsel initiates contact. He falls. He draws the foul. Remember the old NBA \u201cJordan Rules,\u201d in which Michael Jordan got all the calls? Yeah.     7.28pm    27 min: Davies holds well against several defenders. He lays it over for Hutchinson, who rushes his shot and places it well wide.     7.26pm    25 min: De Bruyne leads the break down the middle this time. Laryea makes slight contact with Hazard, who appears to consider the option of falling but decides against it. Good for him. But then he drops on minor contact from Johnston. I\u2019m a referee, so I don\u2019t criticize referees, but come on, man.     7.25pm    23 min: The other bad news: Presses can be beaten. A direct ball goes to Hazard, who makes a nifty turn that leaves Johnston in the dust. Miller makes a vital block to concede a corner that comes to nothing \u2026 besides a counterattack that makes Courtois race out of the box to cover.   Updated at 7.32pm GMT    7.23pm    22 min: The Canadian press (on the field, not in the pressbox, where the Canadian Press does a fine job) is a sight to behold. The bad news is that the referee is now calling fouls for breathing on Belgian players.     7.21pm    20 min: Buchanan is becoming a liability because of his propensity for fouling. Maybe a drawback of having played rough-and-tumble college soccer?     7.20pm    19 min: Belgium breaks the press! Here comes De Bruyne! Tielemans is wide open to his right! And De Bruyne meekly dribbles into the Canadian forest.   Updated at 7.30pm GMT    7.19pm    18 min: Belgium finally gets a minute of possession. It\u2019s in their own half, but at least it\u2019s a period of breaking the pressure. For now \u2013 the press forces a ball all the way back to Courtois.     7.17pm    16 min: Roberto Martinez needs to change something, fast. As (ahem) predicted here, the \u201cveteran\u201d Belgian defenders are having a lot of trouble fending off the Canadian speedsters.     7.15pm    15 min: \u201cAttempts at goal\u201d: Belgium 1 (first minute, harmless), Canada 7.  Costa Rica had zero.     7.14pm    13 min: Cross! Not cleared! Shot blocked! Another shot! Offside call!  This is all happening in the Belgian box. Belgium dominated play for \u2026 the first possession of the game. It has been all Canada since then.     7.13pm    The call, on the other hand, wasn\u2019t controversial \u2026      7.12pm   PENALTY SAVED!  Canada might have an argument with the referee here. That took forever to set up, and Davies had far too long to think about it. Courtois saves it rather easily. The rebound goes back to Davies but at an awkward angle.    Updated at 7.50pm GMT    7.10pm   PENALTY TO CANADA!  That review didn\u2019t take long, and manager Roberto Martinez looks like he\u2019s about to swallow his own face. Yellow to Carrasco as well.     7.09pm    VAR shows Carrasco had his arm out, and the shot hit his arm. Oh dear \u2026   Updated at 7.13pm GMT    7.09pm    8 min: The corner lands to Buchanan, whose side half-volley deflects upward and is snared by Courtois.  Is there a handball? The ref is looking!     7.08pm    7 min: It\u2019s a promising Canadian cross from Buchanan that earns a corner kick.  Canada has completed 45 of the first 69 passes of this game, the stats say.     7.06pm    5 min: So to sum up so far \u2013 one shot each way (Canada\u2019s shot was blocked). And one impetuous foul by Tajon Buchanan. Ah, youth.      7.03pm    2 min: Canada bounces back with a good spell of possession in the attacking third. This is a frenetic start.      7.02pm    1 min: Turnover, Belgian shot from long-range, easily saved.     7.02pm   Kickoff  Referee Janny Sikazwe of Zambia blows the whistle. He has plenty of experience but is also known for blowing the whistle too early in an international game. \u201c\u201cI think God told me to end the match,\u201d he said. (Thanks, CTV, for noting this.)   Updated at 7.09pm GMT    7.00pm    OK, one more \u2026 Richard Hirst writes: \u201cOn the assumption you are Canadian, good luck, I\u2019m rooting for you. After all, (most of) The Band, Joni Mitchell, Neil Young and Paul Peschisolido (yes, I\u2019m a Fulham supporter) - not a bad line up.\u201d I\u2019m not Canadian. At least, not yet. But I\u2019m a huge Rush fan. And I love Kids in the Hall. And health care. And Sarah McLachlan. And I had a great time covering the Olympics in Whistler \u2026 OK, that\u2019s it, I\u2019m moving.  Wait \u2026 it\u2019s cold?      6.58pm    Final preliminaries \u2026 Peter Oh says this game is a perfect \u201cbrunch menu\u201d: \u201cI don\u2019t have a horse in this race but I like Belgian waffles and maple syrup. Hot coffee is brewing and the sun is out on a crisp, cold morning in Northern California. Life could be worse!\u201d Ted Storer on CONCACAF: \u201cYou know this better than most. CONCACAF always seems to have a team at the World Cup Finals who are just happy to have qualified (El Salvador \u2013 1982, Jamaica -1998, Honduras \u2013 every time, Trinidad and Tobago - 2002, Panama - 2018, etc). I am really hoping that Costa Rica is that team for 2022 \u2013 having finished fourth in the regional qualifications and defeating New Zealand on a single goal in the Confederation Play-ins. Really, really, really hoping it is not the US \u2013 or Mexico \u2013 or Canada.\u201d And one for the stat files: Atiba Hutchinson is rather old.  The Canadian anthem was greeted with much enthusiasm. Clearly a lot of Canadian fans there. And the players, along with Herdman, sang loudly. Not on key by any stretch of the imagination, but they gave it a try.     6.53pm   Belgian lineup  This team is apparently pretty good, even without Lukaku. The Red Devils also have three players who are definitely at the back \u2013 Jan Vertonghen, Toby Alderweireld and Leander Dendoncker \u2013 while others are kinda sorta defenders. Kevin De Bruyne and Eden Hazard, generational talents in almost any country, are in the attack with Fenerbahce\u2019s Michy Batshuayi. One note: These guys aren\u2019t young. Players over 30: Courtois (30), Vertonghen (35), Alderweireld (33), Witsel (31), Hazard (31), De Bruyne (31). Good luck dealing with 22-year-olds Davies and David.      6.46pm   Canadian lineup  Miller, Vit\u00f3ria and Johnston are the back line in what you could call a 3-4-3 or 5-2-3 or 5-4-3-2-1 or whatever.  Davies plays farther back on the field for Bayern but plays in the attack for Canada along with David and Hoilett. Hutchinson, the 39-year-old captain, anchors the midfield with Eust\u00e1quio. Cyle Larin, who led CONCACAF qualifying with six goals, is on the bench.       6.40pm    The Canadian conductor \u2026 John Herdman\u2019s teams routinely beat the odds. He led New Zealand\u2019s women to their first World Cup points. (Name-dropping: I was there. I used to do interesting things.) He led Canada\u2019s women to two Olympic bronze medals, one of which could easily have been silver or gold. He led Canada\u2019s men to a resounding march through CONCACAF qualifying. In this case, he\u2019s helped a bit by an upswing in Canadian talent, prodded a bit by people who are starting to take soccer development seriously and intelligently. The Long Term Player Development model stresses development over winning, including a mildly controversial principle of not keeping league standings for players under 12.      6.35pm    Are the Canadians more \u201cAmerican\u201d than the USA? This roster looks like a US roster of the 1990s and 2000s \u2026  Players who played in college (Kamal Miller, Alistair Johnston, Tajon Buchanan, Cyle Larin, Richie Laryea \u2026 plus a couple who played in Canadian colleges) Players who spent most of their childhoods elsewhere but were eligible for Canada (Stephen Eust\u00e1quio, Steven Vit\u00f3ria) Players who came to Canada as refugees (Alphonso Davies, Milan Borjan)  Then add several players who came up through MLS academies, including the prodigy Davies, who moved from Vancouver to Bayern Munich in 2018.      6.23pm    Canada\u2019s record: Poor They\u2019ve only qualified once before, losing all three games in 1986. In CONCACAF qualifying, they\u2019re typically thrashed by Central American opponents, rarely even making it to the final round. This time around?  They won the final round. And that\u2019s after losing two of their last three, having taken their feet off the gas pedals after a torrid run in which they drew away to the mighty Mexico and USA and beat those teams, along with almost everyone else, on home tundra.      6.17pm    Canada 2, Japan 1 Did that get your attention? Hope so.  That was the result last week when Canada faced Japan last week without two of its best players, Alphonso Davies and Stephen Eust\u00e1quio. Yes, that\u2019s the same Japanese team that beat Germany 2-1 today. It\u2019s not a fluke. Time to explain why \u2026      6.10pm   Preamble  The USA drew Wales 1-1 and has shaky chances to advance. Mexico needed a penalty save to hold Poland to a draw in a group torn asunder by Saudi Arabia\u2019s win over Argentina. Costa Rica just gave up five goals to Spain. No, wait, six. Oops, seven. Is it over? Finally? OK, moving on. So the hopes of North America rest with \u2026 Canada? Against Belgium? Indeed they do. And a result here would not be the biggest shock of the Cup. And a Canadian presence in the round of 16 is certainly a strong possibility, especially after seeing Croatia and Morocco launch damp squibs in a scoreless draw today.  This could be fun. Follow along with me, won\u2019t you?  "

                    "body": "Last week, there was a leak. More accurately, a leaked rumour. It probably didn\u2019t register with just about any person who does not play video games, but it was notable nonetheless. FIFA 23, the latest instalment of the hugely popular series, will feature the 2023 Women\u2019s World Cup. It will also make women\u2019s football more prominent than it has been since manufacturer EA Sports introduced female players to the long-running simulation game in 2015. Back then, there were only 12 women\u2019s teams, all of which were international, with no domestic leagues. FIFA 23, however, will reportedly allow players to select women\u2019s club sides for the very first time, including from the FA Women\u2019s Super League, Frauen-Bundesliga, National Women\u2019s Soccer League and Division 1 F\u00e9minine. A video game, of course, is just that \u2013 a fantasy. But it is also a fantasy with more than nine million active players across all platforms. And with the 2023 World Cup now 500 days away, there is genuine value in marketing the women\u2019s game to the global masses.  In little more than 16 months the world\u2019s eyes will fall on Australia and New Zealand, the two hosts of the first tournament to be staged in the southern hemisphere. On Monday morning there were more eyes on a car crash on the Sydney Harbour Bridge than down below in front of the Opera House, where Matildas players and football officials made a press appearance to mark the first of what will undoubtedly be a few milestone events. Though it flew under the radar, it was also important, and appears \u2013 at least on the surface \u2013 to demonstrate a commitment to ensuring this opportunity will not be viewed as one that got away once the bright lights of the tournament have faded. The word \u201clegacy\u201d has a prominent part of the countdown vernacular. Football Australia\u2019s official branding is called Legacy \u201923, a five-pillared \u201cambitious plan to ensure we deliver positive and enduring benefits for Australia\u2019s largest community sport, beyond 2023\u201d. \u201cWe know that this tournament will take women\u2019s football to another level, and we are committed to leveraging it to escalate the growth of women\u2019s football in Australia,\u201d said FA\u2019s head of women\u2019s football, Women\u2019s World Cup legacy and inclusion, Sarah Walsh. \u201cThrough Legacy \u201823 we will deliver meaningful change including 50/50 gender participation, greater female representation in leadership roles and greater access and pathways at all levels of the game.\u201d Indeed, for the first time in World Cup history, the First Nations names for the nine host cities have been weaved into the branding as part of a promise to make real, tangible improvements in the inclusion of Indigenous communities in both countries. The five Australian cities are referred to not just as Adelaide, Brisbane, Melbourne, Perth and Sydney, but also Tarntanya, Meaanjin, Naarm, Boorloo and Gadigal. The New Zealand cities are T\u0101maki Makaurau/Auckland, \u014ctepoti/Dunedin, Kirikiriro/Hamilton, and Te Whanganui-a-Tara/Wellington. Both on the pitch and off, the gestures are laudable, and the federal and state governments says they are on board. But cold hard cash is what makes the world turn and football in this part of it is notorious for having none. Last year, FA chief executive James Johnson lobbied for $275m in government funding over an eight-year period to achieve its ambitious Legacy \u201923 proposal, including $180m earmarked for a \u201cfemale community football facility legacy fund\u201d to reverse a long-standing paucity of infrastructure. He was told he would get only part of that sum. The government has offered some cash, including $12m to support high-performance objectives for the Matildas, Young Matildas and Junior Matildas such as international fixtures. It came after the Women\u2019s Performance Gap Report painted a bleak outlook for the depth of Australia\u2019s national team, a predicament highlighted by the Matildas\u2019 quarter-final exit at January\u2019s Asian Cup. And that is the elephant in the room: that Australia are expected to have eyes on the trophy but could not break the back of a confederation with no teams inside the world\u2019s top nine. It has put coach Tony Gustavsson under significant pressure, though captain Sam Kerr says that is mainly external. \u201cI think we\u2019ve always had this happen to us as a team, where maybe before the World Cup we haven\u2019t been performing or things have happened where they fired our coach, or got a changeover of coach right before the Olympics or the World Cup,\u201d Kerr told Fox Sports on Monday. \u201cFor us that would be the worst thing in the world because starting fresh again, it\u2019s just we\u2019ve done it three or four times now. It happened when we lost Hesterine [de Reus in 2014], when we lost Staj [Alen Stajcic in 2019], when we lost Ante [Milicic in 2020]. It\u2019s always a year out from a major tournament.\u201d Internationally speaking, revenue will not rely solely on the host nations\u2019 performances, and the presence of reigning world champions the United States along with Europe\u2019s heavy hitters should bring a significant economic boost, especially as the world continues to reopen from Covid-19 restrictions. Add to that the presence of new countries in the expanded, 32-team competition, including Vietnam and Stajcic\u2019s Philippines, with whom he has just signed a contract extension to guide the team through the tournament. \u201cSeven teams are now confirmed \u2013 two for the first time,\u201d said Jane Fernandez, Australia\u2019s chief operating officer for the tournament. \u201cQualification will continue to gather momentum over the next 12 months with 25 nations set to secure qualification and join us in Australia and New Zealand 500 days from now for the biggest FIFA Women\u2019s World Cup in history.\u201d"

                    "body": "Josef Kordik was sitting in a cafe in Kyiv when a bedraggled man on the street caught his eye. That, he was sure, was Myklova Trusevych, the great Dynamo goalkeeper. He rushed outside. It was spring 1942, a few months after the city had fallen to the Nazis. Kordik was a Moravian who had been left behind after fighting for Austria-Hungary in the first world war. He had not enjoyed his new life and watching football had been his only joy, but the occupation had meant opportunity. He had falsely claimed Volksdeutsch status and been installed as manager of Bakery Number 1. But for most people occupation had brought suffering. Trusevych had sent his wife, who was Jewish, to Odesa to escape the fighting. His home had been destroyed and he was sleeping rough. Kordik offered him work and accommodation at the bakery. Other stricken Dynamo players joined him. When regular football was established as a way of normalising the occupation, the bakery set up a team and proved themselves the best side in the city.  They played the Luftwaffe team and beat them 5-1. Three days later, on 9 August, they played them again, winning 5-3 in what became known as the Death Match. No game has ever been so shrouded in myth. In the years immediately after the war, it was in effect hushed up. Should Kyivans really have been playing football with the occupiers? After all, one player was sentenced to five years in the gulag for collaboration while another had emigrated to Canada; by definition, they were not good Soviets. But by the Brezhnev era their victory was celebrated: brave Communists offering hope to the people of Kyiv by beating the Nazis. Details accrued, from the plausible \u2013 an SS officer had warned them not to win \u2013 to the absurd \u2013 the players were shot at during the second half. The bare facts are tragic enough. Around 10 days after the game, the players were arrested, seemingly because, having played for Dynamo, the team of the interior ministry, they were technically members of the NKVD, the Soviet secret police. One, Mykola Korotkykh, had briefly been an active officer and died under torture. The others were sent to a camp near Babyn Yar, a ravine in Kyiv that was the site of a Nazi massacre of Jews in 1941. On 24 February 1943, in reprisal for bomb attacks marking the anniversary of the foundation of the Red Army, one in three prisoners were murdered. Oleksiy Klymenko and Ivan Kuzmenko, both of whom had scored against the Luftwaffe, were killed that morning, along with Trusevych. It is a story that has particular resonance in the present context of Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine but its significance is complex. The term sportswashing may have existed for half a dozen years and the modern practice of states or oligarchs taking control of clubs has taken it into a new phase, but football has had soft-power potential since it became a mass preoccupation in the late 19th century.  That can be manipulated, but football is as much a theatre as it is a tool: its soft-power potential is not easily wielded. As the Death Match shows, events are open to multiple interpretations: what one generation feared as collaboration the next saw as heroism; when, in 1971, a memorial was erected to the four players who were killed, it was opposed by the KGB. New meanings are still being teased out of the legend: in Match, a 2012 film about the game directed by Andrey Malyukov, the heroes are Russian\u2011speaking Communists while those who work with the Nazis speak Ukrainian. Football, hostage as it may now be to finance, has a mischievous tendency to confound the best-laid plans: Paris Saint-Germain and Manchester City, for all their investment, have still not won the Champions League, while Chelsea won it for the first time with an interim manager and probably the worst squad they have had since Roman Abramovich\u2019s arrival.  It is 17 years since CSKA Moscow, the former army club, became the first Russian side to win a European trophy. At the time, it was still partly owned by the Russian Ministry of Defence and was sponsored by Sibneft, a corporation owned by Abramovich, although he was bought out by Gazprom a few months later. The Ministry of Defence sold its remaining 25% stake to Bluecastle Enterprises, a company registered in London. The remaining 75% is held by the state development corporation VEB.RF whose chairman, Igor Shuvalov, was sanctioned by the UK on Thursday. Bluecastle, run by CSKA\u2019s president, Evgeny Giner, continues to operate freely. Three years after CSKA\u2019s success, Zenit St Petersburg, who have been owned by Gazprom since December 2005, won the Uefa Cup. Russian football seemed on the verge of an era of great success, but the league is now ranked 10th in Europe, behind Scotland. There was perhaps a natural ceiling to Russia\u2019s challenge to the big four or five leagues and limits on foreign players have raised domestic salaries more than quality, but interest has waned since the World Cup and sanctions imposed after the invasion of Crimea in 2014 have had an impact, with Giner\u2019s energy business particularly badly hit. Then there are the indirect consequences of involvement in football. The United Arab Emirates and Saudi takeovers of Manchester City and Newcastle have led to far greater scrutiny in Britain of those countries\u2019 human rights records than would otherwise have been the case. Such investment is seemingly still regarded as a net positive, but there have been costs. Who would have considered the rights of migrant labourers in Qatar before it bid to host a World Cup?  The irony of this is that for all Russia\u2019s efforts, most particularly by hosting the World Cup and the Winter Olympics, to use sport as a propaganda tool, it is sport that, before the war, provided probably the most visible examples of Ukraine\u2019s existence. Until Volodymyr Zelenskiy emerged as a hero of resistance, the most famous Ukrainians to the rest of the world were sportsmen, Vitali Klitschko and Andriy Shevchenko. Anybody who followed the Champions League knew Shakhtar and Dynamo. The same soft power Russia tried to exploit also gave Ukraine an identity. In the information war, that is no small matter."

Bye!     5.38pm    And finally, here\u2019s a report on Brighton\u2019s victory over Southampton:  Adam Lallana struck against his former club as Brighton inflicted more misery on struggling Southampton with a resounding 3-1 Premier League victory at St Mary\u2019s. The Saints academy graduate Lallana benefited from a major blunder from the home goalkeeper Gavin Bazunu to put Albion ahead before Romain Perraud\u2019s calamitous own goal doubled their half-time advantage. Brighton winger Solly March thumped home a third to cap a dismal first home game in top-flight management for the Southampton manager Nathan Jones.  Much more here:      5.32pm    Andy Hunter watched Wolves snatching all three points at an increasingly angry Goodison Park:  Discontent was building among the home crowd inside Goodison Park even before the Wolves substitute Rayan A\u00eft-Nouri gave Julen Lopetegui the perfect start to his reign and heightened the pressure on Frank Lampard with a 95th-minute winner against Everton. The French defender pounced in the final minute as Wolves secured a fortunate but dramatic victory that lifted them off the bottom of the Premier League. Everton\u2019s overly cautious approach was generating dismay among their fans when James Tarkowski launched one final, long ball towards the Wolves penalty area. It returned with punishing interest, and after A\u00eft-Nouri scrambled home a cross from fellow substitute Adama Traor\u00e9 Everton were left to reflect on another ineffective, wasteful display. It is now six defeats in eight league games for Lampard\u2019s faltering side. Improvement in the final third cannot come quickly enough for Everton.  Much more here:      5.16pm    Peter Lansley witnessed Newcastle\u2019s emphatic win at a limp Leicester:  Not even the World Cup has proved a deterrent in Newcastle United\u2019s pursuit of Champions League football as Eddie Howe\u2019s team climbed into second place in the Premier League with a victory secured in just over half an hour. Early goals from Chris Wood, from the penalty spot, Miguel Almir\u00f3n and Joelinton brought Newcastle a 10th win in 11 games in all competitions against one of the division\u2019s supposed in-form teams, for whom the six-week international break in Qatar proved a block rather than a spur. On this evidence, Newcastle should relish hosting these opponents again in a fortnight in the Carabao Cup quarter-final.  Much more here:      5.15pm    Ed Aarons was at Selhurst Park to see Fulham romp to three goals and just as many points:  Patrick Vieira must be wondering how his side got this so wrong. Crystal Palace\u2019s hopes of recording a fourth successive home victory in the Premier League for the first time in their history were destroyed in a three-minute spell in the first half by a clinical Fulham team led by the brilliant Aleksandar Mitrovic. The disastrous defending that allowed Bobby DeCordova-Reid to open the scoring on 31 minutes was compounded by Tyrick Mitchell\u2019s rush of blood to the head that earned him a straight red card and left Vieira\u2019s side with a mountain to climb. Another red card for James Tomkins \u2013 making his first Premier League start since Boxing Day last year in absence of the suspended Marc Guehi \u2013 and further goals from Fulham\u2019s captain Tim Ream and Mitrovic, with his tenth of the campaign, swept Marco Silva\u2019s side to a deserved victory that leaves them level on points with Liverpool.  Much more here:      5.06pm    The games just keep on coming, and Rob Smyth is on Aston Villa v Liverpool here:      5.04pm   Final scores (part 2)  Total number of goalless draws in today\u2019s English football league schedule: one.

So for now, there\u2019s this: Premier League Crystal Palace 0-3 FulhamEverton 1-2 Wolverhampton WanderersLeicester City 0-3 Newcastle UnitedSouthampton 1-2 Brighton &amp; Hove Albion     4.55pm    Well that\u2019s going to sting.      4.54pm   GOAL! Everton 1-2 Wolves (Ait Nouri, 90+5 mins)  Wolves have nicked it on the break in the last minute! Traore is released on the right and his cross deflects to Ait-Nouri, who smacks it in!   Updated at 5.05pm GMT    4.51pm    Newcastle somehow fail to score a fourth! Murphy rounds the keeper and has a chance to roll the ball into a net guarded only by Wout Faes, but he hits Faes with his shot and it goes wide!     4.50pm    Into stoppage time at Goodison Park, where Everton have been pushing for a late winner. They\u2019ve got another five minutes to find one.     4.47pm    Another excellent save, this time from Pope to stop Vardy pulling a goal back for Leicester against Newcastle.     4.44pm    A brilliant point-blank save from Sa, coming out to claim a cross, realising he\u2019s not going to get there and doing the next best thing, stops Everton going ahead.     4.43pm    On Prime, Martin Keown describes that Willian touch as \u201ca lovely little cross\u201d, which I think is a very generous analysis of what looked like a miskick, but hey, it\u2019s Christmas.     4.42pm    Personally I\u2019m entirely in favour of post-tackle celebrations. This isn\u2019t exactly a tackle, though, more of a sliding deflection into touch. Still, if you enjoy it, why not let the world know?      4.40pm   GOAL! Crystal Palace 0-3 Fulham (Mitrovic, 80 mins)  A third for Fulham! A cross from the right loops beyond the far post to Willian, who scuffs his volley into the ground and it bounces up nicely for Mitrovic to head in from four yards.   Updated at 5.06pm GMT    4.34pm    There was a long delay after that second Fulham goal while the VAR pondered whether the ball had hit Mitrovic\u2019s hand on its way to Ream. It looked like it did, but the goal stands anyway.     4.33pm   GOAL! Southampton 1-3 Brighton (Ward-Prowse, 73 mins)  James Ward-Prowse brings Southampton back into the game, heading in the rebound after his own penalty is well saved by Sanchez.     4.31pm   GOAL! Crystal Palace 0-2 Fulham (Ream, 71 mins)  Of course there\u2019ll be lots of Palace fans who can\u2019t get no sleep after this. Fulham swing in a corner, Mitrovic knocks down and Ream slams it into the roof of the net!  Updated at 4.32pm GMT    4.25pm    A minute\u2019s applause at Crystal Palace for the Palace fan Maxi Jazz, the Faithless frontman who died this week.      4.23pm    Sheffield United are now 2-0 up against Coventry, Ciaran Clark with the second. At Selhurst Park, Fulham are threatening to run riot against a now woefully undermanned Crystal Palace.      4.20pm   Red card! Crystal Palace go down to nine!  James Tomkins brings down Mitrovic and earns himself a second booking. A weird challenge \u2013 the ball is played back towards the keeper and rather than running back to shepherd it towards its target he stands still and sticks out an arm to block Mitrovic, who runs into it, goes down and rolls around a bit. The Mitrovic dramatics weren\u2019t really necessary, but it was a deliberate movement and Tomkins can\u2019t really quibble.     4.15pm   GOAL! Southampton 0-3 Brighton (March, 56 mins)  A fabulous left-foot rocket from March, 25 yards from goal, sends the ball flying into the top corner!   Updated at 4.47pm GMT    4.14pm    Sheffield United, second in the Championship with six wins in their last seven, concede a penalty against Coventry. Wes Foderingham saves, and they remain 1-0 up.     4.08pm    Leicester have brought Jamie Vardy on for Daka at half-time. Southampton have made two changes, bringing Stuart Armstrong and Joe Aribo on, and taking off Diallo and Djenepo.     4.04pm    Second halves are under way. Strap yourselves back in for another 45 minutes of fun.     3.53pm   Half time scores  Here are all the Football League scores as they stand. Teams winning away from home in the Premier League: three (out of four). Teams winning away from home in the Championship, League One and League Two combined: five (out of 28).

There have been eight first-half goals in its four 3pm kick-offs, and no other team in the Football League has more than one except struggling Burton Albion in League One, who look to be on their way to a first league win since 22 October being as they are 3-0 up against Lincoln City.     3.40pm   GOAL! Southampton 0-2 Brighton (Perraud own goal, 35 mins)  Pervis Estupinan\u2019s low cross from the left gets past the keeper at the near post and Romain Perraud has to do something to stop March just tapping it in. And, in his wisdom, he chooses to tap it in himself.      3.37pm   GOAL! Crystal Palace 0-1 Fulham! And then a red card! It's all gone wrong for Palace!  Bobby Reid puts Fulham ahead with a nice first-time finish, and a few seconds later Tyrick Mitchell mistimes a challenge and is given his marching orders!   Updated at 3.55pm GMT    3.35pm   GOALS! Leicester 0-3 Newcastle (Joelinton, 33 mins)  Martin Logan emails to point out that another goal description has gone missing and Newcastle are in fact two up, Almiron having scored a very fine seventh-minute second. And as I\u2019m redescribing that Joelinton heads in a corner and, just as Podence did when he scored for Wolves, stuffs the ball up his shirt in celebration!   Updated at 3.53pm GMT    3.29pm    At Selhurst Park, Jordan Ayew\u2019s first-time effort from 15 yards or so absolutely thunders into the crossbar.      3.25pm    A chance for Leicester, after Dewsbury-Hall plays in Daka. Pope flies out and Daka hits the ball into him, it ricochets back into Daka, and then rolls gently goalwards allowing a defender to clear.     3.24pm   GOAL! Everton 1-1 Wolves (Podence, 22 mins)  That is a lovely equaliser. It starts with a Wolves corner, taken short. The ball in lands at the feet of Moutinho, just outside the area, and he lifts a beautiful right-foot pass over the defence and Podence runs through and tucks in!   Updated at 3.39pm GMT    3.22pm   GOAL! Everton 1-0 Wolves (Mina, 7 mins)  A bit of a technical hiccup here saw a couple of entries disappear somewhere between my computer and the rest of the world. Anyway, Yerry Mina scored a while ago, heading in from a corner after his marker fell over.      3.17pm   GOAL! Southampton 0-1 Brighton (Lallana, 14 mins)  A lovely move from Brighton ends with a cross from the right-hand corner of the area, and a nicely-judged glancing header from Adam Lallana. In truth it was too close to the keeper, who should have pushed it to safety but opted instead to flap it in haplessly.   Updated at 3.52pm GMT    3.11pm    If Hugo Bueno is going to mark Yerry Mina at every set piece, this could get very messy for Wolves.     3.04pm   GOAL! Leicester 0-1 Newcastle (Wood, 3 mins)  And that\u2019s how to take a penalty. The goalkeeper dives to his left and the ball goes hard and high the other way.   Updated at 3.22pm GMT    3.03pm    Penalty to Newcastle! Less than two minutes on the clock and Amartey has brought down Joelinton. You could watch football forever and never see a clearer penalty.     3.00pm    Peeeeeep! They\u2019re off!     3.00pm    There will be a minute\u2019s applause before all the Premier League games for George Cohen, who died this week.      2.56pm    The players are coming out, and the clock is about to strike football o\u2019clock!     2.50pm    Here\u2019s Jeremy Alexander\u2019s match report on that game. Absolutely brutal final sentence.      2.49pm    \u201cI remember Oldham 11 Southport 0 on Boxing Day 1962,\u201d writes Mike Fitzgerald. \u201cThe local Southport Visitor newspaper headlined their match report, \u201cSOUTHPORT CAN\u2019T \u2019OLDAM.\u201d The Boxing Day game that stands out in my memory was travelling to watch my team (Watford) at Fulham in 2000. We lost 5-0 and afterwards I remember talking to Jeremy Alexander, who was reporting on the game for the Guardian, had to file the teams in formation and wasn\u2019t sure given the chaos what Watford\u2019s shape had been. Between us we eventually settled on three at the back and a fluid (or more accurately completely disorganised) midfield seven.      2.40pm    \u201cRe your photo of Goodison\u2019s Main Stand, about 20 years ago I took my father on a stadium tour,\u201d writes Gary Naylor. \u201cOur guide walked in to say hello, a strongly built guy of average height, and my father\u2019s face transformed - Dave Hickson. Both long gone now, but a moment to remember.\u201d Lovely memory of a magnificent old stadium. Sadly now the photograph has long gone too.     2.09pm    Team news is in, and the Premier League protagonists are these: Crystal Palace v FulhamCrystal Palace: Guaita; Clyne, Tomkins, Andersen, Mitchell; Schlupp, Doucoure, Eze; Olise, Ayew, Zaha.

Well let\u2019s just crack on with what promises to be an afternoon of manic festive fun, shall we? Yuletide games are no longer the guarantee of ludicrous scorelines that they once were but it\u2019s still notable that two of the six highest-scoring games in Premier League history were played between Christmas and New Year (Tottenham 6-4 Reading in 2007 and Arsenal 7-3 Newcastle in 2012, since you ask), and today is the first anniversary of the comparatively dull Manchester City 6-3 Leicester.  So here are today\u2019s 3pm kick-offs in the English Football League. There\u2019s a good chance that a few of this lot will turn out to be completely bonkers. Fingers crossed, eh?

                    "body": "Good morning. Transport secretary Mark Harper went to Manchester yesterday to discuss the crisis in train cancellations across the north. Jamie Driscoll, the North of Tyne mayor, attended by Zoom: the train service was too unreliable for him to make the journey. West Yorkshire mayor Tracy Brabin\u2019s train was cancelled, but she made it in the end. Her train home had only half the carriages it was meant to. There\u2019s a pattern here: it\u2019s only a month since Greater Manchester mayor Andy Burnham and Liverpool City Region metro mayor Steve Rotheram were late for a press conference on the same subject because their trains were cancelled. People who live outside the region might have their suspicions about whether these incidents were engineered for maximum political impact: surely trains can\u2019t go wrong this frequently, they might ask. \u201cLol,\u201d say the residents of the north of England, as they wearily refresh the National Rail Enquiries app yet again. There are problems with rail services all over the UK, but the issues across the rest of the country pale in comparison to those in the north. For today\u2019s newsletter, I\u2019ve spoken to Helen Pidd, the Guardian\u2019s north of England editor, about what\u2019s gone wrong, how seriously it\u2019s affecting people\u2019s lives and what can be done to fix it. Here are the headlines. Five big stories  Water | More than 70% of the English water industry is owned by foreign investment vehicles, the super-rich, businesses lodged in tax havens and pension funds, Guardian researcg has found. The disclosure comes amid calls for the industry to be held to account for sewage dumping, leaks and water shortages. Monarchy | A royal aide has resigned and apologised after a black guest, Ngozi Fulani, the founder of the charity Sistah Space, was left feeling \u201ctraumatised\u201d after repeated questioning about her heritage despite having said she was a British national at a reception hosted by the queen consort. China | One of China\u2019s most senior pandemic response officials has said the country is entering a \u201cnew stage and mission\u201d in the latest indication of the government\u2019s changing stance after mass protests against its zero-Covid policy. Vice-premier Sun Chunlan said China was taking a more \u201chumane approach\u201d. Prisons | Dominic Raab has been accused of presiding over a \u201cfoolish and unrealistic\u201d prisons policy after the justice department was forced to request the emergency use of 400 police cells for inmates for the first time in 14 years. Christine McVie | Fleetwood Mac singer-songwriter Christine McVie has died at the age of 79. Bandmate Mick Fleetwood said part of his heart had \u201cflown away today.\u201d  In depth: \u2018It\u2019s like a cloud that\u2019s permanently over everyone\u2019s heads\u2019  When I reach Helen, she is sitting on a train from Manchester to Preston. It\u2019s stationary, but you guessed that already. \u201cI need to get to court for a trial I\u2019m covering for 10am, or 10.30 latest,\u201d she said. \u201cLast night I waited to see the cancellations that would be announced, and there were 60 across TransPennine Express, including quite a few on the line I needed to take. That\u2019s probably going to be a problem, but delays on Northern, the other operator on the line, weren\u2019t as easy to see. So I got up early to leave myself time.\u201d Here\u2019s what Helen found \u2013 note the bright red exclamation marks:  This will be a familiar story to anybody living in the north of England, which has endured dismal transport infrastructure for years \u2013 yet even by that standard, the recent problems on the network look like a genuine crisis. *** How bad is the problem? Pretty bad! Across the UK, services are at a low ebb: train cancellations are at their highest level since records began in 2015, with about one in 26, or just under 4%, being cancelled across the country. But operators in the North are doing significantly worse. While TransPennine Express (TPE) will report cancellation rates of between 5.6% and 11.8% for the weeks between 23 October and 20 November, that figure takes advantage of a significant loophole which means that cancellations confirmed before 10pm the previous night don\u2019t get included: add in those trains, and the figure balloons to 20-30%. (Read more about that in this story of Helen\u2019s published earlier this week.) The 60 trains TPE cancelled on Wednesday by that method is not unusual: Transport for Greater Manchester estimates that 50-80 a day are being pulled the night before. (They are not included in Delay Repay compensation.) Meanwhile, Avanti trains between London and Manchester have been reduced from three to one an hour. In a survey published by watchdog Transport Focus yesterday, 28% of Avanti passengers said that their last journey was delayed, changed, or cancelled, as did 22% of TPE customers. Look at the forest of hands that shoot up when guests at the People\u2019s Powerhouse conference are asked by Tracy Brabin who has recently had a train cancelled. Unsurprisingly, all those missing trains mean that the ones that are still running are severely overcrowded: see this grim account of problems on Avanti trains for more. \u201cIt\u2019s coming up to my 10th anniversary of howling about trains,\u201d said Helen, who started reporting from the region in 2013. \u201cIt\u2019s been bad throughout that time, but recently it seems to be getting worse.\u201d And all of this is estimated by Transport North East to be costing the northern economy around \u00a3400m a year. *** Why is it so bad? The most pressing problem affecting the region\u2019s trains is a shortage of people to drive them. \u201cThe business model relies on drivers being willing to do extra shifts on their rest days and to do overtime,\u201d Helen said. \u201cBut because of bad industrial relations and rail strikes recently, they\u2019ve unilaterally stopped.\u201d There are high levels of sickness, too, which rail expert Christian Wolmar told the BBC was \u201creally an expression of employee dissatisfaction\u201d. Staff haven\u2019t had a pay rise in more than two years. The government has sought to blame unions for this \u2013 although RMT leader Mick Lynch says that Mark Harper has stepped away from his predecessor Grant Shapps\u2019 \u201cbellicose nonsense\u201d. But, Helen points out, \u201crelying on people to work so many more hours than they are supposed to is an unsustainable system\u201d.  Underpinning that short-term personnel crisis are deeper-rooted problems which are the product, critics say, of years of under-investment. Last year\u2019s integrated rail plan reduced capital investment by \u00a336bn across the UK, with most of that shortfall hitting the north, the Northern Powerhouse Partnership says. Jamie Driscoll, the North of Tyne mayor who Zoomed in to the meeting with Harper yesterday, told the Today Programme: \u201cThe infrastructure is Victorian, the signalling is the old-fashioned semaphore you\u2019ll see from black and white movies \u2026 You can only get six trains in and out of Newcastle an hour heading south to the rest of the country.\u201d Similarly, the line running from Liverpool to Hull is not electrified. \u201cFind me a corridor like that anywhere in Europe,\u201d Juergen Maier, vice-chair of the Northern Powerhouse Partnership, told Newsnight. *** How does all that impact people\u2019s lives? It has a profound effect, Helen says, as her train starts to crawl forwards again. \u201cIt deeply affects people\u2019s lives, and life chances.\u201d Take the seaside town of Cleethorpes, where many residents badly need an efficient rail service to get to better-paying jobs in Manchester: 77 trains on that line were cancelled in the week to 25 November. \u201cIf you want a better-paid job or the chance to go to college somewhere else, you just can\u2019t rely on it.\u201d  The choice becomes to give up on your ambitions, move away (and deal another small blow to your home town\u2019s economy), or use a car \u2013 which, Helen noted recently, is a significant factor in driving emissions. Meanwhile, even life\u2019s pleasures become an endurance test. \u201cDo I risk going to a gig, or a theatre, or a football match if I might have to get a taxi home? What about childcare? It\u2019s like a cloud that\u2019s permanently over everyone\u2019s heads.\u201d Would the situation be allowed to persist if the same thing was happening in London or the south east? \u201cNot a chance in hell.\u201d *** How can the problems be fixed? The government has sought to link a deal on pay that would put an end to strike action \u2013 and likely mean the return of rest-day work and overtime \u2013 to accepting a new seven-day rota.  The region\u2019s mayors have run out of patience with that approach, and while they described their meeting with Harper as \u201cpositive\u201d, they added that \u201cthe time for warm words is over\u201d and said that the government must not \u201creward these appalling levels of service by signing-off on contract extensions when they come up for renewal.\u201d Harper, for his part, said that he would not block a rest day working agreement but said it was an \u201cinterim step\u201d. Meanwhile, almost 100 new drivers are meant to be in place for Avanti by the time of a timetable change due on 11 December \u2013 when more trains are supposed to be added to the schedule. But, says Helen, there is little obvious reason to hope for proper investment. \u201cThe most immediate problem for the government is whether it should allow these operators\u2019 contracts to continue,\u201d she said. \u201cBut the big structural issues are not going away.\u201d Then she goes into a tunnel. She eventually gets to court 40 minutes late. What else we\u2019ve been reading   Twitter\u2019s future remains uncertain after Elon Musk told staff that bankruptcy was not out of the question. But while the platform does not have the profit margins or user base of other social media sites, it has transformed journalism \u2013 four Guardian writers look back at 16 years of Twitter\u2019s existence and the way it has changed their lives personally and professionally. Nimo Jonathan Jones asked artists including Gilbert and George, Elizabeth Price, and Gillian Wearing to have a go at using those spookily effective AI image generators to create new pieces.

The results were enough to put Argentina and Poland through. Poland made it by the narrowest of margins, only ahead of Mexico on yellow card count until Salem al-Dawsari scored for Saudi Arabia in the 95th minute \u2013 but even then one more goal for Mexico would have been enough to take them through.

A City supporter was arrested and ejected from the Etihad after abusing disabled Liverpool fans on the disabled tribune. A 15-year-old girl required medical treatment after being injured by one of several objects thrown into the home crowd from the visiting section.\nIf identified, the culprit will face criminal charges as well as a ban from Anfield and the Etihad. City and Liverpool, who had worked together with respective supporters\u2019 groups before the game in an attempt to improve the atmosphere at the cup tie, issued a joint statement on Friday condemning the incidents.\nIt read: \u201cBoth clubs would like to thank the vast majority of fans for their behaviour at last night\u2019s Carabao Cup match at the Etihad Stadium. It is however hugely disappointing that there were a number of incidents during last night\u2019s match that are wholly unacceptable.\n\n\u201cThese incidents will be fully investigated, reported to the police and the individuals who are found to be responsible will be subject to the sanction process of their respective club. Manchester City FC and Liverpool FC are fully committed to working together to eradicate these issues from our fixtures. They have no place in football.\u201d\nLiverpool are working to identify those responsible for throwing objects from the away section. GMP\u2019s match commander, superintendent Gareth Parkin, added: \u201cWe are aware of a number of objects, including coins and a smoke bomb, that were thrown during the match. We will be investigating the incidents and reviewing CCTV from the night.\n\u201cClearly throwing objects in a confined area can be dangerous, and have serious and sometimes devastating consequences \u2013 GMP sends its thoughts and wishes to the girl who was injured and wish her a speedy recovery.\n\u201cTwo men were arrested on suspicion of trying to take a pyrotechnic into the ground and a male arrested for a racially aggravated public order offence. All three will be interviewed at a later date. A 53-year-old man was also assaulted after the game at the junction of Ashton New Road and Alan Turing Way.

                    "body": "The triumphant announcement of a mixed-teams event across Australia to launch the next summer of tennis stems from a crisis of conscience three years ago. Billed as a world first \u201cshowcasing equality at the highest level of the sport\u201d, the United Cup will feature the world\u2019s best men and women and is a positive step forward for tennis. Three years in the making, the 18-team, $23m event promises to be a celebration of tennis at its best to whet the appetite leading into the Australian Open at Melbourne Park. Bar for the onset of Covid-19, it is a competition that would have started a year ago at the latest, and with good reason given the controversy that unfolded in Brisbane in January, 2020.  For an organisation that champions its commitment to equality, a point emphasised in the press release announcing the United Cup, Tennis Australia was on the defensive that summer as it attempted to fend off accusations of sexism. The introduction of the lucrative ATP Cup, an event similar to the Davis Cup, resulted in a farce that sparked a seething reaction from some of the biggest stars in women\u2019s tennis. As per a contractual agreement, the men\u2019s team event had to be played on the main stadium courts in Brisbane, Sydney and Perth, where it started on the back foot after being introduced at the cost of the long-running and popular Hopman Cup. This meant that in Brisbane, which had drawn an extremely strong WTA field, women were given the cold shoulder and sent to the back blocks for a \u201csecond-hand\u201d event. Just shy of 50 years after Billie Jean King and the Original Nine boldly took on the establishment when launching a women\u2019s professional tour, the disparity in treatment and the gulf in prize money on offer between the sexes was galling.  Ash Barty had returned to Australia a grand slam champion and the world\u2019s top-ranked woman. But what should have been a triumphant homecoming party in Brisbane unfolded in a doubles match on an outside court with makeshift stands instead of Pat Rafter Arena.  Grand slam champions Maria Sharapova, Sloane Stephens and Sam Stosur were all forced outside as well, but not world No 486 Michail Pervolarakis, who enjoyed rare stadium time. Sharapova, a five-time major champion returning from injury, described it as a \u201cstrange strategic move\u201d and said \u201cthere\u2019s a lot of girls that are deserving of that centre-court spot\u201d.  The Gold Coast-raised Stosur said the treatment was a \u201cbit rough\u201d and \u201cnot great\u201d and confusing for fans. Stephens was especially scathing when saying it was disappointing the women \u201cwere not even in the conversation to begin with\u201d. \u201cIt was what the ATP wanted,\u201d she said. \u201cThey got what they wanted. [The] girls to the side. That\u2019s kind of how it always is.\u201d In a sport where unforced and forced errors can decide the outcome of a match, this was an example of the latter, with Tennis Australia backed into a corner. With men agitating for more money, and the ATP Cup arrived at by tour officials as the vehicle to raise finances, the event was being shopped to other international markets. Sacrifices, which included the Hopman Cup, were made by Tennis Australia to protect their calendar turf and ensure that the world\u2019s best men did not start their summers elsewhere.  Of itself, the ATP Cup enjoyed some fine moments. The atmosphere inside Pat Rafter Arena as Alex de Minaur took it to Alexander Zverev, with Nick Kyrgios taunting the German from the sidelines, was electric. The finals in Sydney produced some brilliant tennis. Hopman Cup co-founder Paul McNamee credits the ATP Cup with reinvigorating doubles.   But the potential for lasting reputational damage to Tennis Australia and the sport was clear and prompted TA chief executive Craig Tiley to describe it as a \u201ctransitional year\u201d. Barty was still to play her singles \u2013 organisers waited until the ATP Cup left town to schedule her on Pat Rafter Arena \u2013 when Tiley confirmed changes would occur. This included the prospect of a second stadium court in Brisbane. With the Olympics on the horizon in 2032, that may happen.  After years of negotiations, which included some fine-tuning over the past month to ensure all parties are happy, the exclusion of Russian and Belarusian players aside, the United Cup is now alive, with lessons hopefully learnt from the tumult of Brisbane .

Indonesia, the UAE, the Maldives, Jordan, Bahrain and Libya have joined Qatar, Kuwait, Iran, Saudi Arabia, Oman, and Afghanistan in lodging official complaints over comments from representatives of the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata party. Meanwhile hardline party members have reacted angrily to disciplinary action against the pair after their comments went viral in the Middle East. Indonesia, which has the largest number of Muslims in the world, summoned the Indian ambassador in Jakarta. \u201cIndonesia strongly condemns unacceptable derogatory remarks against Prophet Muhammad PBUH [peace be upon him] by two Indian politicians,\u201d read a tweet by the foreign ministry. Bahrain called on \u201cthe need to denounce any reprehensible insults against the Prophet Muhammad PBUH, as a provocation to Muslims\u2019 feelings and incitement to religious hatred\u201d. The BJP\u2019s attempt to quell the anger by suspending its national spokesperson, Nupur Sharma, and expelling its Delhi media head, Naveen Kumar Jindal, and dismissing them as \u201cfringe elements\u201d who did not represent the government\u2019s views has had little success in the Muslim world. And at home Hindu hardliners who have frequently targeted India\u2019s Muslim minority vented their anger over the climbdown, unusually for a party that has never faced any internal criticism in its eight years in power. Many praised Sharma, who made the remarks during a debate on a rightwing news channel, and expressed incredulity that a BJP government could buckle to pressure from Muslim countries. Jindal was expelled over a tweet he made about the prophet which has since been deleted. The hashtag \u201c#ShameOnBJP\u201d was trending on Twitter along with expressions of solidarity with the national spokesperson and, in a rare rebuke to Modi, hardliners have suggested that Uttar Pradesh\u2019s firebrand chief minister, Yogi Adityanath, might make a better prime minister. The party has contended that it cannot jeopardise India\u2019s extensive trade links with the Arab world, its need for Gulf oil, and the requirement to protect the 6.5 million Indians who live in the Gulf. Indian opposition leaders have meanwhile demanded the arrest of Sharma, who has told Delhi police she has received death threats, and Jindal, saying the action taken so far was a sham. The Congress party leader, Rahul Gandhi, accused the BJP of dividing India internally and weakening it externally. \u201cThe BJP\u2019s shameful bigotry has not only isolated us, but also damaged India\u2019s standing globally,\u201d he tweeted."

                    "body": "One of the surprising and moving elements of running a football club is how regularly we hear from supporters who want to recognise and celebrate a loved one who is no longer with us. Before our first game of 2023, against Stockport County, we had a minute\u2019s celebration accompanied by a lone piper as we remembered all the supporters of the club who passed away in the previous 12 months. There isn\u2019t a week where we don\u2019t hear from a member of our community who has lost a loved one and wants them to be remembered and commemorated on a match day. In December we said farewell to Brian Taylor with a round of applause in the 63rd minute against Salford, marking his age when he passed away, and in the past couple of weeks we lost one of our oldest supporters, Milly (95) who I met with her family at our recent game against Stevenage. A lifelong commitment to a club, as Brian and Milly demonstrated, is impressive and life-affirming because it reinforces the social significance of sport and importance of emotion, memory and place. It\u2019s a privilege and is a constant reminder to me of the importance of football clubs and their ability to open an emotional space for celebration, particularly for those who might find the expression of emotion difficult elsewhere.  As the son of an absent father, some of my earliest memories are associated with playing and attending football. Outside of sport, there weren\u2019t many positive, adult male role models growing up in Grimsby in the 70s and early 80s. Certainly not many that were \u2018emotionally available\u2019. Like many places, the town was beginning the painful transition from old industrial jobs to the service economy, a fitful process and one that remains incomplete. It meant the men in our lives had worked at sea, on docks and in factories that most of us never would. It was the world Grayson Perry brought to life in his book The Descent of Man, reflecting on the kind of masculinity shaped by the harsh working environment of fishing trawlers, mining or steel mills. The mental and physical toughness needed to endure labouring jobs spilled out into the wider environment, one where hardness always threatened to erupt into violence without notice. Physical intimidation, the ability to hold your beer and take or throw a punch were the real currencies, along with playing and watching football. In town and with three brothers, I got plenty of experience of all of them. Over Christmas, I read Andrew O\u2019Hagan\u2019s book Mayflies before watching the TV adaptation. Both versions really touched me. The main theme was male friendship and love over time against the aforementioned industrial decline. It made me reflect on the role football, alongside music, plays as a primary driver of memories and opportunities to forge deep connections and relationships, particularly for men. I was struck by the physical affection of the main characters in the TV adaptation. The characters\u2019 shared experience of music replicated my experience of watching football. In my memory it was part of the only way men would be demonstrative with each other. The moments of ecstasy and abandon when a goal is scored or the final whistle declaring a result going your way. The shared experience of supporting a team through good and bad, the raising of voices together and singing in unity deeply imprints on the nature of our relationships in a way few other things can. As Professor Alan Bairner says: \u201cMen were uncomfortable with expressing their emotions, football and its spaces providing some of the few available loci for emotional outbursts.\u201d We are social creatures, driven by the need for attachment and relationships, which are proven to be the key drivers of happiness in people\u2019s lives. On a personal level it feels that physical displays of affection gradually started to find a place in our lives in the 90s. In part a combination of exposure to different cultures, the growing language and understanding of our psychology, and I imagine in no small way the prevalence of ecstasy around that time, that for some opened the male psyche to deeper, hitherto uncharted expressions of love and connection. The effects of this societal narrative are becoming clearer for men my age and we are much more aware of the challenges of mental health. We have made great strides in acknowledging the daily struggles for some people. At Grimsby Town FC we have partnered with the mental health organisation Navigo to think about how football can help men talk about and improve their mental health.  We know that men between the ages of 35-50, living alone and unemployed are at highest risk of taking their own lives. Those working in sectors such as construction and manufacturing have a higher risk and males with a Severe Mental Illness (SMI) are 2.8 to 7.1 times more likely to die before the age of 75 than males without SMI. Football clubs have a vital role to play in opening the space for deep connection. As Simon Beeton, Navigo\u2019s CEO, says: \u201cA place to be, a place to call home, a place to feel welcome and above all socialise.\u201d Football\u2019s toxic image of \u2018hypermasculinity\u2019 and outdated stereotypes have gradually been challenged and it is becoming a natural place to build positive relationships, share experiences and express ourselves. The EFL has taken steps to make the sport more inclusive, such as introducing the rainbow laces campaign which urges players and fans to show their support for the LGBTQ+ community, and since 2018 has had a partnership with Mind to create the On Your Side initiative focused on wellbeing. In our own small way, Grimsby Town are determined to play our part in building an environment of understanding, acceptance and connection that acknowledges the powerful importance of football in creating and sustaining relationships. We owe it to the memory of our loved ones, such as Brian and Milly, to ensure that football remains a place to honour and celebrate their lifelong passion for the game. It is our hope that in doing so, we can create a space for positive experiences that will make a difference to the mental health of our community. \u2022 Jason Stockwood is the chairman of Grimsby Town In the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123, or email jo@samaritans.org or jo@samaritans.ie.

                    "body": "Peter de Savary, who has died aged 78, liked to describe himself as a swashbuckling entrepreneur, adventurer and sportsman. He came to fame in the 1980s and 90s for his patriotic but unsuccessful attempts to win the America\u2019s Cup yacht race, with a series of expensive craft. A restless speculator, who would buy a derelict castle on a whim, he once owned both Land\u2019s End and John o\u2019Groats but his serendipitous business ventures could often be short-lived. He was an early Brexiter, and stood unsuccessfully for James Goldsmith\u2019s Referendum party in the 1997 general election. De Savary, a colourful and noisy figure who loved cigars and vintage cars, came close to a British triumph in the America\u2019s Cup in 1983 with his boat Victory 83, losing in the final heat to Alan Bond\u2019s Australia II. But his attempt to mount further challenges were unsuccessful and ended in 1994 when Placeton, the holding company for much of his interests, went into receivership with \u00a3200m debts and De Savary had to sell his homes. He bounced back, however, and rebuilt a rather smaller fortune, once estimated at \u00a334m, by concentrating on satisfying the tastes of the rich and famous for privacy in exclusive hotels. He transformed more than 60 hotels, seven championship golf courses, most attached to hotels, and three marinas. Most recently he had been living on a luxury houseboat on the Thames in London. De Savary was born in Burnham-on-Crouch, Essex. His father, John, who had been born in France, ran a pig farm. But when Peter was two, his parents separated and his mother, Vera, took him to live with her second husband, a Shell executive, in a Venezuelan oilfield. Despatched aged nine to Britain to board at prep school and then Charterhouse in Surrey, he never tired of saying how much he hated school. With a single O-level in scripture to his name, at 16 he was expelled after being found in bed with the headmaster\u2019s au pair. Rejecting the offer of an apprenticeship in the joinery business his father had established, he went to live with his mother in Canada and took a series of casual jobs before returning at 20 with his first wife, Marcia, and their child. Four years later, after quarrelling with his father and leaving the business, he was in so much debt that he had to sell his house and car. But his fortunes changed when in 1969 he met a widowed friend of his mother who was attempting to sell her husband\u2019s Dutch import and export business. De Savary borrowed the money to buy it from a friend and moved to The Hague where he developed the business, Afrex, much of it in Nigeria, which was in the process of rebuilding after the civil war; one of his partners was the president\u2019s brother.  Other ventures followed. His share in a Kuwaiti oil company led to a lifelong connection with the industry and he was involved with founding an ultimately unsuccessful bank in the Bahamas. Back in London, the now wealthy De Savary turned to providing hospitality for his counterparts; something that would help to define his life. Declaring that even expensive hotels were too often filled with people he did not like, in 1979 he founded the St James\u2019s Club, a boutique membership hotel for the rich, and rolled out the formula internationally (in New York, Antigua, Paris and Los Angeles), later selling out for many millions. At one point he tried to acquire the Mar-a-Lago complex in Florida, only to be outbid by Donald Trump. He bought into gaming, buying the Aspinalls casinos for \u00a390m in 1987 but selling them two years later because he said his mother did not approve of gambling. The impulsive De Savary bought and sold a long trail of country homes. In the mid-80s he bought on the Roseland peninsula in Cornwall. Though he claimed it was only intended as a private retreat, in less than two years, in a splurge, he had bought Falmouth docks, drawing up plans for a marina and residential complex there, started an oil bunkering service for passing ships, founded Pendennis Shipyard to build and service yachts, and acquired Land\u2019s End, which he turned into a theme park (it seemed inevitable that he should follow it with the purchase of land at John o\u2019Groats). It was seen as the largest investment in Cornwall for years but by 1992 he had relinquished nearly all his interests in the county, as once again he moved on. By 1985, De Savary was divorced from Marcia and had become engaged to Lana Paton, a former beauty queen whom he had met in South Carolina. But then he suddenly married his personal assistant Alice Simms in a ceremony in Gibraltar. Six weeks later, it was over and De Savary married Lana the following year. In 1987, the aircraft carrying them and his children crashed on a Caribbean reef, killing the pilot. The party were trapped in the upside-down aircraft before being rescued by a surfer. Later De Savary said, in an interview with the magazine Cigar Aficionado: \u201cAt that point my philosophy on life changed. When you genuinely look death in the eye, you know it\u2019s a pretty tenuous thing you are hanging on to.\u201d Property, with its lure of profitable development, was always a key part of De Savary\u2019s portfolio. As well as his Cornish interests, at various times he owned more than 200 acres on Canvey Island, Essex; planned a container port in Kent; invested in Southampton airport in 1988, in the then-unrealised hope of turning it into an international airport (he sold it to BAA in 1990); and acquired numerous hotel sites with surrounding land for development. The most dramatic was Skibo Castle \u2013 acquired in 1990 \u2013 a Victorian pile in Sutherland once belonging to the Scottish-American industrialist and philanthropist Andrew Carnegie. Up for auction when De Savary visited it in search of pictures connected to his wife\u2019s family, he found it so irresistible that he bought in within the week. After his financial meltdown in the early 90s, he turned Skibo into the first of a series of high-end international Carnegie Clubs, good enough to host the wedding of Madonna and Guy Ritchie in 2000, before once more selling on. In recent years, he had sold his latest country house on the basis that it should not be a burden to his wife after his death, while he also announced an apparent intention not to leave his fortune to his children: \u201cCarnegie\u2019s view was \u2018to die rich is to die disgraced\u2019; I wanted them to make their own way without that burden of my legacy.\u201d He is survived by Lana and their three daughters, and the two daughters from his first marriage.  \u2022 Peter de Savary, entrepreneur, born 11 July 1944; died 30 October 2022"

                    "body": "The first running of Newbury\u2019s most historic handicap chase in its new guise as the Coral Gold Cup is one of the most competitive renewals this century, with no fewer than five horses top-priced as 8-1 co-favourites on Friday morning and four more a point behind on 9-1.\nRemastered, a faller four out when going like the winner 12 months ago, may prove to be the pick of the market leaders, but despite the strength and depth of the field, it is a surprise to find Our Power (3.05) at a double-figure price a little further down the list.\n\nSam Thomas\u2019s seven-year-old was steadily progressive last season and put up a new career-best to win the London Gold Cup at Ascot in October, posting an excellent time in the process. Our Power remains unexposed beyond three miles, is proven on good ground and is an excellent bet at around 12-1 to give both Thomas and Sam Twiston-Davies, his jockey, a first win in this race.\nNewbury 1.20 Paul Nicholls had Kapcorse \u2013 who carries the famous colours of the late Sir Peter O\u2019Sullevan \u2013 ready to win this race run in O\u2019Sullevan\u2019s memory first time up last year and a 6lb rise in the weights may not be enough to prevent a repeat performance.\nNewcastle 1.35 Malinello has a long absence to overcome on his chasing debut but Ben Pauling has an impressive record with horses returning from a layoff and the seven-year-old\u2019s brief hurdling career in 2020-21 suggests his opening mark is more than fair.\nNewbury 1.55 Lightly-raced mare West Balboa has excellent prospects of making a winning handicap debut off 127 having finished within seven lengths of Stage Star in last year\u2019s Challow Hurdle over track and trip.\n\nNewcastle 2.10 Seven days later than planned, Constitution Hill returns to action with at least a stone in hand of his field on Timeform\u2019s ratings and anything other than a third Grade One win from four starts over hurdles will be one of the shocks of the season.\nNewbury 2.30 Nicky Henderson has two runners as he looks for a third win in this race in four years and Theatre Glory, an impressive winner off an 8lb lower mark at Kelso in March, could be the pick of them with useful conditional Nathan Brennan taking off 7lb.\n\nNewcastle 3.25 A tough assignment for L\u2019Homme Presse, last season\u2019s Brown Advisory Novice Chase winner at Cheltenham, as he returns to action in a handicap off a mark of 164. At the likely odds, Into Overdrive looks a better bet at around 4-1, as he gets 22lb from the favourite and has the benefit of a run this season.\nNewbury 3.40 Amarillo Sky has returned in excellent form and should follow up his recent win at Cheltenham\u2019s November meeting.\nChamp beats Paisley Park in thriller\nChamp and Paisley Park, the veterans in a five-horse field, produced a memorable finish to the Grade Two Long Distance Hurdle at Newbury on Friday, with Champ holding the late charge of his fellow 10-year-old, Paisley Park, by a neck ahead of what is likely to be a rematch in the Long Walk Hurdle at Ascot in three weeks\u2019 time.\nChamp set out to make all the running under Jonjo O\u2019Neill jnr and looked set for a straightforward success as Paisley Park came under pressure on the run to the second-last. The former Stayers\u2019 Hurdle winner kept finding more for Aidan Coleman, however, and the gap between the two horses was down to less than two lengths at the final flight.\nThey were separated by the width of the track as Paisley Park continued to eat into Champ\u2019s lead all the way to the line, but Nicky Henderson\u2019s runner had just enough in the tank to get over the line.\n\n\u201cOur old boy has won an RSA Chase over fences and everybody adores him,\u201d Henderson told Racing TV afterwards. \u201cHe\u2019s got the most lovely character and he\u2019s such a sweet horse. AP [McCoy] rode him in a gallop here 10 days ago and he thought he was in great form, but he does have his ailments as well. He\u2019s a bit creaky, like all of us at that age.\n\u201cYou could see we were travelling and Paisley Park was off the bridle, but you can never write him off. You can never read Paisley Park, he might stand still at the start and still come and beat you.\nHe\u2019s a bizarre character, but he\u2019s a phenomenal horse with a phenomenal team and I\u2019m sure we\u2019re going to meet again in three weeks\u2019 time.\u201d\nHenderson was completing a double after Jet Powered\u2019s impressive 11-length success in the card\u2019s novice hurdle, a performance which saw the five-year-old installed as an 8-1 chance for the Supreme Novice Hurdle at Cheltenham in March.\nThe card\u2019s Grade Two novice chase, meanwhile, produced a surprise as Sebastopol, the 22-1 outsider of four runners, stayed on strongly to beat Paul Nicholls\u2019s Stage Star, the 2-7 favourite, by five lengths."

                    "body": "Steve Clarke has admitted to serious doubts that Scotland\u2019s World Cup play-off semi-final against Ukraine will take place on its rescheduled early June date. Ukraine\u2019s visit to Hampden Park, originally set for Thursday, was postponed due to Russia\u2019s invasion of the country. It has since emerged that several of Ukraine\u2019s squad have signed up for military service. Scotland will host Poland in a friendly instead, with \u00a310 from every ticket sold being donated to Unicef\u2019s Ukrainian aid efforts.  Provisional Uefa and Fifa plans involve Scotland facing Ukraine on a June date originally intended for Nations League fixtures, with the winners to face Wales or Austria days later for a World Cup place. Clarke, while adamant the semi-final should take place if at all possible, is sceptical about that happening in little more than two months. \u201cThe very short answer is \u2018no\u2019,\u201d the Scotland manager said when asked whether there had been an update on the play-off. \u201cI would imagine everyone is waiting until this round of matches is out of the way and then see how the situation develops. But, obviously, it\u2019s not looking great at this moment. \u201cIf you\u2019re asking me now will the game go ahead in June then it\u2019s going to be difficult,\u201d Clarke added. \u201cBut it\u2019s a situation we can\u2019t control, so I\u2019ll focus on these two friendlies and make sure we get something out of the games in this camp. \u201cThen, maybe in April, we can all sit down together, look at the schedule and how it\u2019s going to pan out for us. It\u2019s difficult to see how we\u2019ll be playing them in June and it\u2019s not just about the fixture \u2013 it\u2019s the fact that they need to get together, have a training camp and get all their players on the pitch with a proper period of time to prepare for such an important game. \u201cAndriy Shevchenko, who I know from my time at Chelsea, spoke quite well about the situation and said they would want to play on the pitch. The way the situation is I think they should get as much time as possible to try to make that game happen, Scotland against Ukraine at Hampden.\u201d It remains unclear what would happen if June proves an unviable option. The game could be pushed into the September international window. \u201cWe have to be guided by Fifa, Uefa and most importantly by Ukraine themselves,\u201d Clarke added. \u201cIt\u2019s just a horrible, horrible situation and the quicker we know we\u2019re going to play Ukraine at Hampden the better because it will mean the war has stopped and we\u2019re all trying to move forward again. We have to be guided by other people and hope and pray that the situation improves enough for the fixture to go ahead at some time.\u201d  The Scotland captain, Andrew Robertson, will miss the Poland match because of illness, but the Liverpool full-back may return for the friendly against Wales or Austria on Tuesday. Clarke is expected to name his strongest available team, with Everton\u2019s Nathan Patterson likely to play at right-back despite a shortage of domestic minutes since his \u00a311m January move from Rangers. The Poland head coach, Czeslaw Michniewicz, in charge of the team for the first time, denied he would shuffle his pack drastically with next week\u2019s play-off final against Sweden or the Czech Republic in mind."

AS\u2022 Barbican Art Gallery, London, 8 September-8 January. Winslow Homer: Force of Nature This great US artist lived and painted through the American civil war and went on to paint seascapes that are mysterious allegories of history. His masterpiece The Gulf Stream, in which a man on a broken boat waits for the sharks, suggests a country doomed by racism. The American Turner. JJ\u2022 National Gallery, London, 10 September-8 January. Lindisfarne Gospels  The most beautiful manuscript of Anglo-Saxon England returns to the north-east where it was created in about AD700. It was written out and sumptuously illustrated with holy portraits and Islamic-style abstract patterns by Eadfrith, Bishop of Lindisfarne, nearly a century before the Vikings raided this sacred island.

Apartheid haunts Kentridge but he transposes his country\u2019s troubled story on to an epic global canvas of history, philosophy and science. His films and theatre works all grow out of a gift for drawing, and intensely beautiful charcoal studies underpin everything. AS\u2022 Royal Academy, London, 24 September-11 December. Hallyu! The Korean Wave  How often can you see images from Squid Game alongside 19th-century Korean paintings of courtesans? This survey of South Korea\u2019s world-conquering pop culture looks back into history as well as spanning everything from Gangnam Style to Parasite, with art including Gwon Osang\u2019s kitsch painted sculpture of a mythical dragon fight. JJ\u2022 V&amp;A, London, 24 September-25 June. Hollow Earth: Art, Caves and the Subterranean Imaginary Delve deep in this exploration of what lies beneath. Everyone from Ren\u00e9 Magritte to Robert Smithson, Joseph Wright of Derby, Jeff Wall and Brassa\u00ef are here, along with doomsday bunkers, places of magic and horror, refuge and entombment. A portable underworld, the show will travel to Cork and Exeter in 2023. AS\u2022 Nottingham Contemporary, 24 September-22 January. Forrest Bess: Out of the Blue The beautiful, queer, semi-abstract paintings of Forrest Bess are as enigmatic and strange as the Texas painter\u2019s life. Laden with private symbolism, and driven by a yearning to achieve a state of immortality by becoming a hermaphrodite, Bass\u2019s art is as inventive and rigorous as his story is alarming. AS\u2022 Camden Arts Centre, London, 30 September-15 January. Lucian Freud: New Perspectives  It is a century since Lucian Freud was born in Berlin. This exhibition tries to stand back from his fame to see his art in the bigger picture of art history and so, maybe, allow us to judge his achievements. How do his paintings look alongside the Titians and Corots he loved? JJ\u2022 National Gallery, London, 1 October-22 January. C\u00e9zanne The exhibition of the year. Paul C\u00e9zanne invented modern art by looking hard at mountains, ruins, rocks and apples. He looked beyond the impressionists to find abstraction inside appearances. His art is about the struggle to see in restless, endless glances and gazes that grasp fragments of truth in the heat. JJ\u2022 Tate Modern, London, 5 October-12 March. Kamala Ibrahim Ishag A vociferous champion of women\u2019s rights and artistic freedom, Kamala Ibrahim Ishag has lived and painted in her home city of Khartoum for most of her career, after studying at London\u2019s Royal College of Art in the mid 1960s. Now in her 80s, she has been influenced by Sudanese folklore and spiritualism, by William Blake and Francis Bacon, as well as contemporary political events.

Cerith Wyn Evans Winner of the 2019 Hepworth sculpture prize, the Llanelli-born artist returns to Wales for his largest UK show to date. With his complex works using sound and light, neon, music and language, Wyn Evans makes startling environments and situations.

Cecilia Vicu\u00f1a From bold early paintings that portray radical heroes to installations that use textiles and thread on an enveloping scale, this Chilean artist has campaigned for new ways of seeing the world since the 1970s. Her installation in Britain\u2019s biggest art space is likely to be a magic realist eco-feminist spectacular. JJ\u2022 Tate Modern Turbine Hall, London, 11 October-16 April. Hieroglyphs: Unlocking Ancient Egypt  Ancient Egypt has always inspired awe and wonder. Renaissance popes put up Egyptian obelisks and Shelley marvelled at the colossus of Ramses the Great. But what did it all mean? This blockbuster centred on the Rosetta Stone reveals how it helped decipher hieroglyphs and decode Egypt\u2019s fascinating mythology and history.

Turner prize Sculpture, moving image, photography, the voice and the image come together in what should be a real humdinger of a Turner prize, returning to Tate Liverpool this year. The shortlist, with Heather Phillipson, Veronica Ryan, Ingrid Pollard and Sin Wai Kin, makes for a show as entertaining as it is serious, affecting as it is spirited. AS\u2022 Tate Liverpool, 20 October-19 March. Hannah Starkey Belfast-born photographer Hannah Starkey has long deserved a major museum survey. Her carefully staged images have, throughout her career, sought to portray the relationships between women and the environment. Often monumentally scaled, and moving between public and private spaces, from reflective moments to street protests, Starkey reveals dramas and stillness, witnessing tension and curiosity, the unguarded and the vulnerable. AS\u2022 Hepworth Wakefield, 20 October-30 April. Lynette Yiadom-Boakye: Fly in League With the Night This engrossing survey of work by a highly original painter was so cruelly closed by the pandemic that it\u2019s getting a relaunch. Yiadom-Boakye creates imaginary portraits of Black people. Her intimate, haunting closeups bloom into epic history paintings. She is making up for centuries of exclusion with her counterfactual art museum. JJ\u2022 Tate Britain, London, 24 November-26 February. Architecture and design Objects of Desire: Surrealism and Design 1924-Today A lobster telephone, bicycle saddle chair and sofa shaped like a big pair of red lips will descend on the Design Museum this October, showing how surrealist art has influenced the world of design from the 1920s to the present \u2013 culminating in gloopy 3D-printed furniture, sketched out in mid-air using motion capture. OW\u2022 Design Museum, London, 14 October-19 February. Plastic: Remaking Our World From revolutionary wonder material to dastardly scourge of the planet, the meteoric rise and fall of plastic will be charted in this new exhibition that examines its 150-year history. Bakelite telephones will rub shoulders with trainers made with plastic harvested from the oceans, alongside a glimpse of the fungal future of bioplastics grown from mycelium. OW\u2022 V&amp;A Dundee, 29 October-5 February. Al Janoub stadium, Qatar  After decades of cities being assaulted by phallic towers, now comes the great yonic monument to swallow them all. Designed by the late Zaha Hadid, the Al Janoub stadium rises out of the Qatari desert in a magnificent vulvic bulge, its rooftop sculpted in sinuous labial lips that sweep open to frame the football pitch, cradled womblike within. Will sports correspondents struggle to find the press box? OW\u2022 Qatar, November. Horror in the Modernist Block Move over, gothic haunted house! The modernist block is where horror truly lies, according to a new exhibition in Birmingham, a city that\u2019s no stranger to the terrifying power of modernist urban planning. Here, contemporary artists will explore how modernism in architecture, fiction, film and art has been used to tap into our deepest fears. OW\u2022 Ikon Gallery, Birmingham, 25 November-1 May. Battersea Power Station After lying derelict for the past 40 years, Battersea\u2019s majestic brick temple of electricity will finally reopen its doors this autumn, now stuffed full of shops, bars and restaurants. It will be crowned with a \u201cchimney lift experience\u201d, whisking visitors 100 metres up for a perfect view of the surrounding car crash of luxury flats. OW\u2022 London SW8, autumn."

                    "body": "The only threat to Ukraine\u2019s bid to keep their World Cup campaign alive came from a level of physical and mental fatigue that was wholly understandable. When Artem Dovbyk strode forward to score in the fifth minute of stoppage time, it was clear even tiredness could not halt the Ukrainian dream.\nThere will be inevitable focus on the paucity of Scotland\u2019s showing here but Ukraine were exceptional. After Andriy Yarmolenko and Roman Yaremchuk handed the visitors a deserved two-goal lead, unlikely home hope arose from a goalkeeping blunder.\nIn plain football terms, let alone taking into account the circumstances Ukraine\u2019s players encountered before this match, late Scotland salvation would have been totally unfair. Cheers reverberated from Glasgow to Kyiv \u2013 including in many towns and cities in between \u2013 after it did not arrive. The scale of emotion as Ukraine celebrated their win was appropriate. The stars wore yellow.\n\n\u201cFocus on football\u201d had been the recurring pre-match message from within the Scotland camp. That essentially happened straight from kick-off, with every crunching tackle by those in navy met with roars of approval from the majority of the crowd. Earlier, when draped in the flags of their country, Ukraine players had clapped those supporters for their widespread applause of their national anthem.\nThe approach of everyone associated with the Scotland team to Ukraine has been on point from the moment it was clear this semi-final, initially scheduled for March, would at the very least be delayed. Ukraine had no desire to be patronised here; they duly were not.\nSteve Clarke\u2019s insistence that the scale of this football challenge had to be respected partly resonated in the knowledge that Ukraine have fine players. Within 17 minutes, the visitors had twice been denied by a superb Craig Gordon.\n\nScotland\u2019s goalkeeper saved acrobatically from Viktor Tsygankov. His next stop, when Yarmolenko looked certain to score from close range , was even better. As Gordon leapt upon the loose ball, the Ukraine coach, Oleksandr Petrakov, did nothing to mask his frustration. At age 39, Gordon remains in the form of his life.\nScotland spent those early exchanges struggling to gain a foothold in the game. Clarke had gambled with the deployment of two strikers, Ch\u00e9 Adams and Lyndon Dykes, but looked on as the opposition midfield imposed themselves on proceedings. Ukraine were the slicker, sharper, more coherent team during the opening half. And by a considerable distance.\nWhen the goal that Ukraine completely deserved arrived it was blissfully simple. A chipped pass from the deep-lying Ruslan Malinovskyi should have been swept up by the Scottish central defence. Instead, Yarmolenko was allowed to reach it first. The West Ham player showed composure to loft the ball over the onrushing Gordon. Home appeals for offside proved in vain. The sense of Scotland stage fright was both impossible to ignore and ominously similar to what transpired throughout games at this venue during last summer\u2019s Euros.\n\nClarke used the break to make the perfectly logical move to replace the ineffectual Dykes with Ryan Christie. In doing so, the manager wanted to amend a back-to-front approach that had failed to work. The problem was, Ukraine doubled their lead before Scotland had a chance to implement their new plan.\nGenerous defending was again a factor. Oleksandr Karavaev was given time and space to float a cross to the back post, where Yaremchuk was the gleeful benefactor. Neither Aaron Hickey nor Scott McTominay could beat the striker in the air. Yaremchuk nodded past the helpless Gordon from all of six yards.\n\nWhile Ukraine celebrated wildly, Scotland were hit with the stark realisation of being in deep trouble. The hosts\u2019 challenge would have been insurmountable but for a smart Gordon block from Yarmolenko.\nThe Ukraine goalkeeper, Heorhiy Bushchan, perhaps through boredom, cracked a clearance against the onrushing Callum McGregor. In summing up all that had gone before, the ball flew wide of the goal.\nJohn McGinn then passed up the kind of opportunity Scotland had desperately wanted. After Bushchan flapped at a cross, the Aston Villa midfielder had a glorious chance to head into the net from close range. Instead, McGinn inexplicably sent his attempt wide. It was no wonder he slumped to his knees.\n\nThat the erratic Bushchan played his part in a Scotland goal was little surprise. McGregor was really only trying to keep an attack alive with a lofted ball that the goalkeeper allowed to squirm through his hands. The assistant referee rightly adjudged the ball had bounced over the line before a despairing Ukraine clearance.\nScotland, who had been generally desperate until this 79th-minute juncture, had a pulse. The final act, though, belonged to Dovbyk as he marauded on to Oleksandr Zinchenko\u2019s through pass. Only the bold can assert that Wales will deny Ukraine their spot in Qatar."

                    "body": "What a mess. Gareth Southgate knew that he needed a win to restore a measure of calm after a deeply unconvincing start to this Nations League campaign, which had brought two points from the first three ties and one goal; none from open play. What the England manager got was a new and tortuous low \u2013 the heaviest defeat of his near six-year England tenure, the nation\u2019s worst home loss since 1928 and a mutiny among the home crowd here at Molineux.\nThe fans had started to make for the exits when Roland Sallai scored his second goal of the evening to put Hungary 2-0 up, the boos ringing out, and it was at that point that everything fell apart for Southgate and his team.\n\nPreviously, England had lacked inspiration, coming to look more and more unnerved as the chuntering from the home support rose inexorably. Now Hungary put them to the sword, their substitutes rushing on to the pitch as two more goals went in. At full time, they would dance in front of the visiting enclosure, wreathed in smiles, barely able to believe it.\nIt felt almost surreal when Zsolt Nagy lashed home the third. \u201cYou don\u2019t know what you\u2019re doing,\u201d bellowed the fans at Southgate, more of them leaving, hurling abuse as they did.\n\nIt was toxic and even worse was to follow. It had been a dreadful evening for John Stones, although he was hardly alone, and the nadir came when he was sent off for a harsh second yellow card. He did not know that the substitute Daniel Gazdag was behind him; the Hungary player simply ran into him.\nSouthgate responded by introducing Harry Maguire for Bukayo Saka, which prompted yet more boos. Poor Maguire. \u201cYou\u2019re getting sacked in the morning,\u201d came the cry from the stands for the manager.\nThe humiliation was complete when another substitute, Adam Nagy, played a straight pass, Maguire stood still and Kyle Walker chased back but he could not prevent Gazdag from clipping over Aaron Ramsdale.\nSouthgate was motionless in his technical area. At full time, he walked out on to the pitch and \u2013 bravely or foolishly \u2013 applauded the crowd. He had to know what would come back and he was not disappointed.\nSouthgate had seen nothing go right from start to finish \u2013 not his 4-3-3 system in the first half, nor the 3-5-2 after the interval. Too often his players were bullied in the one-on-ones, particularly by the big Hungary No 9, Adam Szalai, and, too often, their decision-making or end product was poor. Too often, moves ran into dead ends; the inspiration absent, the tempo ponderous.\nThe closest England came to a goal was when Harry Kane looped a header against the crossbar on 77 minutes. He chased down the rebound before crumpling to the ground under no challenge; a lamentable dive that summed things up.\nEngland find themselves starring at relegation from this Nations League group, which would not only be damaging in terms of optics but also on a practical level, raising the possibility of a tougher Euro 2024 qualifying draw. The big, fat worry is what it all means for the World Cup, which kicks off on 21 November.\nIt will be a long summer of introspection for Southgate and, thereafter, he has only two more matches before the opening tie in Qatar \u2013 against Italy and Germany in the Nations League in late September. Things can unravel pretty quickly in football, particularly in volatile environments such as that which England inhabit. Southgate had promised last Friday not to overstay his welcome in the job. Those words hung heavy in the Wolverhampton air.\n\nRemarkably, this was England\u2019s fourth meeting of the season with Hungary, the previous one having come on the Saturday before last, a game that Adam Nagy had called \u201cthe debacle in Budapest\u201d. He was judging it from an England point of view, Southgate\u2019s team having been flat in the 1-0 loss. What of this?\nEngland set the tone with the first concession. Adam Lang rose with Stones to meet a Dominik Szoboszlai free-kick and Kane miskicked his attempted clearance to leave the unmarked Sallai with the shooting chance. The forward\u2019s first touch was true; he blasted the second past the exposed Ramsdale.\nJarrod Bowen had mistimed his jump on a header at 0-0 and the anxiety in the stands was tangible after the first goal, along with the sense of foreboding because Hungary are so tough to break down. When Stones dwelled in possession on 23 minutes, the home crowd howled. England were on egg shells.\nIt would have been 2-0 in the 27th minute but for an excellent goalline clearance by Reece James. When England broke quickly, Bowen fluffed the final action. England consistently lacked conviction on the ball.\nEngland were booed off at half-time. It is the rule. Their only other moment of note had been when Willi Orban headed a Saka cross towards his own goal to draw a save out of Denes Dibusz.\nThe cat calls would only grow in intensity, starting when Kalvin Phillips was robbed by the substitute Martin Adam who played in Sallai. The finish was low and lethal. England, though, had fresh depths to plumb."

                    "body": "It was a landmark moment for women\u2019s football. Under the arch of Wembley stadium, to the soundtrack of Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s feminist anthem Run the World (Girls), more than 70,000 fans streamed in to watch Team GB take on Brazil in the London Olympics to result in what was then Britain\u2019s biggest ever women\u2019s football match. Team GB won 1-0 but that was almost (sort of) beside the point. The atmosphere was electric. In the crowd, where I was covering the match for the Evening Standard, the moment was a revelation. I couldn\u2019t believe there were so many women and girls. Not because they didn\u2019t belong \u2013 of course they did \u2013 but after a lifetime of hearing that women were rubbish at football and being made to feel that our views on the subject were unwelcome it felt completely wild.  But most striking of all was the mood. As well as \u201crocking\u201d and \u201ca night never to forget for women\u2019s football in this country\u201d, as player turned commentator Alex Scott, who was on the pitch that night, described it at the time, it was also convivial and friendly (and a sharp contrast to my only previous live football experience selling pies as a student at Carrow Road, Norwich City\u2019s ground). Despite breaking records \u2013 and proving that women\u2019s football could fill the home of football \u2013 many England players then still had day jobs. The Women\u2019s Super League (WSL) had yet to become fully professional. How the landscape has shifted in a decade. Now, as England prepares to host the women\u2019s Euros, which start on 6 July, with 450,000 tickets sold across the 25 days, it is already the biggest ever women\u2019s sporting event in Europe. Games will take place in 10 venues including Wembley, Old Trafford, Brighton and Hove community stadium and St Mary\u2019s in Southampton. Despite, so far at least, not having quite the same hype as the men\u2019s Euros last year, public appetite appears to be huge. England\u2019s three group matches (including the opening game at Old Trafford: capacity 71,300) and the final at Wembley (capacity 87,200) are already sold out. In fact, if everybody who has bought a ticket attends the final, it will mark the highest ever attendance for a men or women\u2019s game at the Euros. A total of 96,000 international visitors are expected, as well as a global broadcast audience of 250 million. So what has happened in the past 10 years? \u201cThe catalyst was the Olympics and that match,\u201d said Faye White, 44, England women\u2019s longest serving captain between 2002 and 2012. She also thinks it had a big impact on women\u2019s sport more generally. Then there was the triple heartache \u2013 first in the 2015 World Cup, coming third, then in the 2017 Euros when they lost to the Netherlands in the semi-finals and then, two years later in 2019, when they lost in the World Cup semis, this time to the US. Financial investment and the professionalisation of the game in 2018 have been essential to the shift, but White says increased media attention has also been crucial. \u201cDuring my career that was always the barrier.\u201d Now, she added, it\u2019s a regular fixture in sports news. England games are televised as well as many of the WSL games.  With an impressive squad the Lionesses are among the favourites to win and a manager with a winning record in their Dutch coach Sarina Wiegman (who reportedly implements strict rules: no quilted jackets or socks with sliders in team meetings) led the Netherlands to Euros victory in 2017 when they too were the host nation and got them to the 2019 World Cup final. For the first time at a major tournament they are using an app to monitor their menstrual cycles and Wiegman talks about the creation of a \u201csafe\u201d environment. \u201cShe makes you feel comfortable 100% but she\u2019s also someone I wouldn\u2019t want to cross,\u201d new England captain Leah Williamson, 25, said recently. Although there is still disparity between clubs, full-time pay and top staff and facilities make an enormous difference, White said. \u201cIn my time, and even before the WSL went professional, top players were having to get part-time jobs to support themselves.\u201d She added: \u201cIt is just a no-brainer really: when you can contribute 100% of your time in making sure that you get the best out of yourself in a sporting capacity it\u2019s a very big difference.\u201d Former England and Manchester United goalie Siobhan Chamberlain, who is working on a master\u2019s dissertation about the lack of women in leadership positions in football, said the game is in an exciting place.  \u201cThe game\u2019s at a turning point. This is the stepping stone to take it to that next level. But you\u2019ve got to be performing and winning on the pitch to get to that next level and I\u2019m sure the girls will feel that pressure but also revel in it.\u201d By \u201cnext level\u201d she means raising the bar across the league, not just among the top three of four teams. Also essential is filling stadiums. Although the big Euros games are sold out, that is often not the case for league games. \u201cYes, it\u2019s fantastic having exposure on TV platforms, having live games, and that\u2019s only going to help the game grow. But it also needs to turn into \u2018can we get more bums on seats? Can we get more people in stadiums?\u2019 That will be a massive turning point for the game.\u201d Football execs need to turn full stadiums in the Euros into sold-out WSL games this summer, she said. How exactly is unclear, but location, timing, matches, promotions, visibility and, crucially, success are key. \u201cIf you win a tournament like this the interest will be unbelievable \u2013 not just from fans wanting to come but media interest, brands that then want to come on board with the game,\u201d she said, citing Williamson on Pepsi Max billboards as an example. \u201cThat\u2019s what success does.\u201d Since the last Euros, when England lost 3-0 to the Netherlands in the semis, the women\u2019s game in England has grown massively, which Chamberlain said is demonstrated by the big-name foreign players coming to England, such as Australian national captain Sam Kerr, who plays for Chelsea, in the WSL. \u201cInstead of going to play in Germany, France, USA, they\u2019re coming to England.\u201d Big teams such as Manchester United, which brought back its women\u2019s side in 2018, and Liverpool, back in the WSL next season after being promoted, help too.  The landscape is also changing for women working across football, but they are still missing in the boardroom, says Lungi Macebo, chief operating officer of Birmingham City FC. \u201cWhat we haven\u2019t see enough of is the growth in terms of senior management and board level areas. It\u2019s been there but very very minimal,\u201d she said. She said the women\u2019s leagues are \u201ccoming on\u201d, especially across Europe, but that there\u2019s a lot to learn from US women\u2019s football, especially in terms of the ownership model and supporter engagement. Jane Purdon, director of Women in Football, said she has had numerous \u201cpinch me moments\u201d over the past 10 years but that the Euros, especially if England do well, will mark \u201canother step-change\u201d. Although a lifelong fan of the men\u2019s game \u2013 her dad used to take her to Sunderland matches as a child \u2013 Purdon believes parents \u201cfeel more comfortable to take their children to a women\u2019s football game\u201d. The tournament is proving a hit with women and children \u2013 including Princess Charlotte, 7, who instructed her father to alert the England team to her goalkeeping skills. So far, 45% of ticket buyers are female and just under a quarter are under-16s. Purdon said one venue has reported that 30% of its ticket sales are to children. At the men\u2019s Euros final last summer, she said some of her female friends had \u201chorrendous experiences because of their gender\u201d. Some, she said, had men lean into them and say: \u201cWhat are you doing here? It\u2019s a waste of a ticket.\u201d This is not something that she thinks is likely to happen at a women\u2019s match. \u201cI think England fans in the women\u2019s game look very different.\u201d However, England\u2019s women\u2019s football is by no means a model operation, specifically with racial diversity issues among spectators and players.  \u201cWe\u2019ll see what the crowds look like in this Euros and I think football needs to be really alive to this,\u201d said Purdon. \u201cAnd if it looks like it\u2019s too narrow a demographic, we need to ask ourselves why is that? And do something about it.\u201d Sue Campbell, the FA\u2019s director of women\u2019s football, said that through the Euros\u2019 legacy programme they hope to encourage more people from diverse backgrounds into the sport through half a million new playing, coaching, volunteering and refereeing opportunities across the host cities. \u201cIt\u2019s the beginning of us trying to open up the game to a much wider audience than we\u2019ve done in the past,\u201d Lady Campbell said. \u201cI hope people will see it as a really positive landmark for girls and women \u2013 not just in sport but in society as a whole.\u201d"

Medibank also confirmed the hackers accessed the name, date of birth, address, phone number and email address for around 9.7m current and former customers.\n\u2022 Independent senators Jacquie Lambie and David Pocock called for the government to split its industrial relations bill, with the latter arguing it had been very rushed, and that splitting it would see low-paid people get pay rises faster.\n\u2022 Traditional owners from the Torres Strait built a mock seawall outside Parliament House, in a bid to get Labor to go further on climate action and protect their islands.\n\u2022 The attorney general\u2019s department told Senate estimates that it did not provide advice to Christian Porter before the then attorney general advised Scott Morrison on the way he could be appointed to multiple ministries.\n\u2022 Australian Electoral Commission disclosures revealed that Atlassian founder Scott Farquhar was the biggest donor to the six successful teal independent candidates, followed by fellow co-founder Mike Cannon-Brookes\u2019 climate campaigning entity, Boundless Earth.\n\u2022 And the head of the Fair Work Commission, Justice Iain Ross, has announced his retirement, effective 18 November.\nThanks for sticking with us. We\u2019ll be back tomorrow.\n\nUpdated at 7.43am GMT\n\n\n 7.06am  \n\nCost-cutting at the Parliament House cafeteria\nBrace yourself for a very Canberra Bubble update, but the Department of Parliamentary Services has confirmed that the decision to cut back the variety of food at the Parliament House staff cafeteria was indeed due to cost-cutting.\nIf you do not work in this palace of democracy your eyes may glaze over here, but the cafeteria used to switch up its bain-marie buffet menu in the middle of the week, with one set of food for the first few days and an entirely different one for the back end of the week.\nRecently the cafeteria upped the price of coffee and also food as inflation pressures came for Canberra too, before APH occupants also noticed the midweek menu change had also fallen by the wayside.\nA sometimes frankly baffling combination of buffet items now sticks around for a whole week. Coalition senator James McGrath asked DPS in a Senate estimates hearing this afternoon what happened to the variety?\n\u201cI\u2019m asking this on behalf of some of the staff who are in the building full-time,\u201d McGrath asked secretary Rob Stefanic, saying his question went to looking after \u201cthe brilliant staff\u201d who work in APH:\n\nI ask this with seriousness ... on behalf of staff and not my stomach.\n\nStefanic said DPS was looking to improve the level of service for building occupants, with the midweek menu change aiming to give \u201cvariety\u201d for staff. But he also noted that costs had to go up:\n\nAs part of the cost side we reduced it back to a single menu through the week.\n\n\nUpdated at 7.15am GMT\n\n\n 6.58am  \n\nHere\u2019s the Minister for Home Affairs, Clare O\u2019Neil, making a statement on the Medibank ransom demand and the company\u2019s refusal to pay it. \nMedibank\u2019s decision is consistent with Australian government advice, she says: \n\n\n\n\n 6.46am  \nRobodebt scheme was 'oversold' in briefing to Morrison: DHS official\n\nThe robodebt scheme was \u201coversold\u201d by the Department of Human Services when it was briefed to Scott Morrison, an official from DHS has told a royal commission.\nChristopher Birrer, the deputy chief executive at DHS\u2019s successor agency Services Australia, told the inquiry on Monday there had been more than 860,000 welfare debts flagged as potential overpayments in advice provided to Morrison in early 2015. But he said this was never going to lead to the budget savings promised. Morrison was social services minister at the time.\nAsked it had been \u201coversold\u201d from the beginning, Birrer replied:\n\nIt was terribly oversold, commissioner... I\u2019ve used the phrase, like a \u2018slam dunk\u2019, that this [debt] was out there to get. Even if averaging was lawful, DHS would never have recovered what was in that executive minute.\n\nBirrer added:\n\nIt\u2019s disappointing that the benefits were oversold and the risks understated.\n\nHolmes said:\n\nIt\u2019s the chemical weapons in Iraq, slam dunk sort of thing.\n\nBirrer only joined the agency in 2020, five years after the robodebt scheme was established, and also months after it had been wound up.\nWith hindsight, he said a crucial moment was the failure of DHS to emphasise the legal concerns held by the Department of Social Services in its February brief to Morrison.\nThese had shared between high ranking officials from both departments in January 2015, and then \u201cwatered down\u201d though still included in the advice provided to Morrison the following month.\nBirrer said another issue was a \u201cdemanding and difficult leadership environment\u201d with \u201caggressive and demanding leadership\u201d. He said this conduct was, according to the recollections of others, \u201cinappropriate\u201d:\n\nThere was an attempt to essentially make it look like everything was fine.\n\nThe commission continues.\n\nUpdated at 6.52am GMT\n\n\n 6.37am  \n\nMichael Manetta, the AAT member who says he was benched for deciding cases against the government, has commented on evidence in Senate Estimates that he has been reinstated to the social security division.\nManetta told Guardian Australia his complaint had been \u201cgrossly mishandled from beginning to end\u201d, but declined to say more citing the confidentiality of the process. Manetta\u2019s complaint concluded with a resolution to reinstate him on 4 October, and he\u2019ll be back hearing cases by 15 November.\nIn Estimates, officials said they couldn\u2019t say more because of the privacy of the parties.\n\n\n\n 6.36am  \nSplit the bill to help low-paid people now: David Pocock\n\nThe independent senator, David Pocock, has responded to Labor\u2019s \u201cget wages moving\u201d rhetoric by noting that the whole point of splitting the IR bill would be to help the low-paid sooner.\nPocock said:\n\nIt\u2019s good to see the government addressing many of the concerns I and others have raised with the amendments they have announced today. I\u2019m working through the details of the fairly substantial amendments the government is proposing.\nIn order to urgently deliver pay rises for the lowest paid workers, the government should move forward with the supported (low paid) and co-operative multi-enterprise bargaining streams now.\nI look forward to continuing constructive engagement with the government, including on matters not covered in today\u2019s updates and the more complex changes in the bill to make sure we get them right.\n\n\n\nUpdated at 6.55am GMT\n\n\n 6.30am  \n\nFirst Dog on the Moon has taken on robodebt today.\n\nRead that, but then also read Luke Henriques-Gomes\u2019 report from the actual robodebt royal commission hearings (spoiler: satire is dead and not remotely funny):\n\n\nUpdated at 6.38am GMT\n\n\n 6.25am  \n\nWalgett, Collarenebri and Lightning Ridge completely isolated due to flooding\nThe New South Wales State Emergency Service has sent through an update about its work in the flood areas.\nWalgett, Collarenebri and Lightning Ridge have been completely isolated thanks to major flooding, with the Castlereagh Highway closed for almost a week.\nThey have 16 helicopters assisting with supplies to communities and in partnership with emergency services, they\u2019re running regular ferry services by boat to stranded residents at Gingie and Namoi on the outskirts of Walgett.\nThere have been 268 requests for assistance in the 24 hours to 2pm today \u2013 18 of those have been flood rescues.\nThere are currently 103 NSW SES warnings current, 15 at emergency, 65 at watch and act and 23 at advice.\n\nUpdated at 6.32am GMT\n\n\n 6.13am  \nAAT officials pressed in Senate estimates over tribunal member's complaint\n\nIn Senate estimates, Greens senator David Shoebridge has interrogated Administrative Appeals Tribunal officials about the complaint of a member of the tribunal who said he was benched from hearing social security cases because he decided too many against the government.\nIn May Michael Manetta told Guardian Australia that the AAT deputy president, Karen Synon, a former Liberal senator, expressed concern in June 2021 about the number of appeals against his decisions by the Department of Social Services before he was benched in September in a bid to increase \u201cconsistency\u201d between tribunal members\u2019 decisions.\n\nOn Monday the AAT\u2019s registrar, Michael Hawkins, told Senate Estimates:\nThere was a complaint made to the president and the president has consulted with the parties and a conclusion has been reached ... I understand Mr Manetta is practising in the same field again ... He is now hearing matters in the [social security] division.\n\nHawkins refused to give any other details about the complaint, how it was handled and the conclusion - citing the privacy of the parties.\nIn May, Manetta had branded the decision to bench him \u201ccompletely incompatible with the rule of law\u201d and warned it \u201cundermines the impartiality and independence of the tribunal\u201d.\nSynon said she categorically denies \u201cany implication or inference that I have acted in any manner that is not fair, impartial and just in the exercise of my statutory duties at the AAT\u201d.\n\nUpdated at 6.23am GMT\n\n\n 6.01am  \n\nFederal immigration minister, Andrew Giles, has been speaking to the ABC where he was asked about reports published in the Australian \u201csuggesting you are being used as a fundraising machine for Victorian premier Daniel Andrews [in the Victorian state election], particularly in multicultural communities\u201d.\nGiles responds:\n\nTime to time I, like all politicians, \u2026 support other candidates for fundraising. I do so when I am asked, if I support the candidate or cause. When I do so, and always report, they are matters I have attended to by myself in my own time, driving my own car. Sharing my perspective on the portfolio issues I am responsible for, expressing, not dealing with any individual issues, I always conduct myself with integrity and carrying out my duties, that\u2019s a really critical part of any public office is to maintain a public trust.\n\n\nUpdated at 6.09am GMT\n\n\n 5.47am  \n\nQatar rejects calls for compensation for killed and injured World Cup workers\nQatar has rejected calls for a compensation fund for migrant workers killed or injured during World Cup preparations, with the country\u2019s labour minister labelling it a \u201cpublicity stunt\u201d.\nLabour minister Ali bin Samikh Al Marri said Qatar had already handed out hundreds of millions of dollars in unpaid wages and accused the Gulf state\u2019s critics of \u201cracism\u201d.\nMarri said Qatar already has a fund to deal with worker deaths and injuries. He told AFP:\n\nOur door is open. We have dealt with and resolved a lot of cases.\nIf there is a person entitled to compensation who has not received it, they should come forward and we will help them.\n\nControversy has surrounded Qatar\u2019s World Cup preparations, particularly over consistent alleged human rights abuses against migrant workers and the rights of LGBTQI+ people in the country.\nOn Friday, Football Australia was presented with a petition of almost 5,500 signatures calling on the organisation to publicly support a compensation fund to support any migrant workers injured \u2013 and the families of those killed \u2013 working on preparations for the Qatar World Cup.\nBe Slavery Free, a charity focused on ending slavery, presented Football Australia with the petition that stated:\n\nWhen Qatar was awarded the 2022 World Cup, almost 12 years ago, it had very little infrastructure (three football stadiums) or labour (one million population) to support such a mammoth global event. In the years since, thousands of migrant workers, mostly from Asia and Africa flocked to the Gulf state to make the Fifa World Cup possible.\nAlarming reports of abuse, exploitation and forced labour of workers resulting in serious harm and death have not ceased since.\nHowever, very little has been done to remedy the situation.\n\nIn a statement, Be Slavery Free said:\n\nLast week, Football Australia and the Socceroos both released statements supporting the establishment of a Migrant Workers Centre but they have stopped short of calling for reparations for the workers who have been injured and the 6,500 or more families who have lost loved ones.\nWith global partners Freedom United, Be Slavery Free is asking Football Australia to publicly support a compensation fund for migrant workers, equivalent to the prize money of US$440 million. Football Australia was given a petition of almost 5,500 signatures asking for this.\n\nLast week the president of Fifa, Gianni Infantino, took the unusual step of writing to all 32 nations competing at this month\u2019s World Cup, urging them to \u201clet football take the stage\u201d in Qatar.\nHere\u2019s some more background to this story:\n\n\nUpdated at 6.12am GMT\n\n\n 5.33am  \n\nAnother severe thunderstorm warning for heavy rainfall \u2013 this time for New South Wales and parts of the ACT. It comes on the back of more general thunderstorm warnings earlier this afternoon, though I suspect people in the region are already aware of it\u2026\n\n\n\n\n 5.27am  \n\nRudd suggests government department turned blind eye to News Corp\nFormer prime minister Kevin Rudd\u2019s staff accused an Australian government department of taking a \u201cdon\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell\u201d approach to News Corp after finding the media company did not need to register under the foreign influence scheme.\nDocuments obtained by Guardian Australia reveal the Attorney General\u2019s Department dismissed two cases that the former prime minister suggested may require News Corp to disclose activities under the scheme.\nIn a letter released under freedom of information laws, Rudd cited the reporting by the Saturday Telegraph in May 2020 about Covid\u2019s origins, which appeared under the headline \u201cChina\u2019s batty science: Bombshell dossier lays out the case against the People\u2019s Republic\u201d.\nThe details in this \u201cworld exclusive\u201d were attributed to \u201ca dossier prepared by concerned western governments\u201d. Rudd drew attention to previously published advice by Bret Walker SC.\nRudd wrote in the October 2021 letter:\n\nThis advice noted that, in the absence of an exemption for media activities, any decision of News Corp Australia to receive and distribute information on behalf of a foreign government seeking to influence political discourse in Australia would be registrable.\n\nRead the exclusive report here:\n\n\nUpdated at 5.41am GMT\n\n\n 5.15am  \nPaying ransom would \u2018increase risk of extortion for customers\u2019: Medibank chief\n\nMedibank\u2019s chief executive, David Koczkar, has been speaking to ABC\u2019s Afternoon Briefing, about the fact that the accounts of 9.7m current and former customers of Medibank and its subsidiary, AHM, were accessed in a data breach.\nMedibank announced today it will not pay a ransom to the alleged hacker. The company is, however, offering some compensation for some customers.\nKoczkar said:\n\nLast week we announced a hardship package for those particularly vulnerable customers who may be victims of cybercrime, I encourage anyone who needs support to contact Medibank through one of our dedicated cybercrime phone lines or through our scam emails. Also, if customers prefer, they can contact the government through cyber website with the reports to raise an incident if they have been a victim of cybercrime.\nWe stand ready to support our customers in the event that they become impacted by this cybercrime in the event of the criminal contacts them, in the event that they are extorted.\n\nThe fact that they refused to pay a ransom was partly due to the fact that there was only limited chance that it would make customers\u2019 data any safer, Koczkar said.\n\nBased on extensive advice we\u2019ve heard from cybercrime experts, there\u2019s only a small chance that any extortion payment would actually return the data of our customers. There is actually a strong chance that any payment would actually increase the risk of extortion for our customers and actually put more strain this is a decision that consistent with the Government policy on rent somewhere and this is why we\u2019ve made a decision to not pay this ransom.\n\nFor more on this, check out Josh Taylor\u2019s earlier story:\n\n\nUpdated at 6.23am GMT\n\n\n 5.08am  \n\nMore details on ban of political fundraisers at Parliament House\nWe\u2019ve got a little more info on the recently reported ban on political fundraisers inside Parliament House, instituted by the prime minister, Anthony Albanese.\nThe Department of Parliamentary Services told a Senate estimates hearing that nine functions called up DPS to cancel their events when news of the ban was made public before budget week.\nDPS officials also said future bookings for events inside Parliament House will include a section where applicants must confirm their shindig isn\u2019t a political fundraiser. If there\u2019s any doubt, DPS will further investigate and ask applicants to sign a statutory declaration about the event.\nRob Stefanic, secretary of the Department of Parliamentary Services, told the hearing that a final policy is currently being signed off by the presiding officers of the House and Senate.\nHe said the definition of banned political events includes:\n\n\u2026 those organised by registered political parties and/or candidates for public office and/or any third party where funds are collected in connection to the event for the purpose of donating raised funds to a political party, campaign and/or candidate.\n\n\nUpdated at 6.10am GMT\n\n\n 4.59am  \n\nDepartment rules that TikTok is OK for politicians\nThe federal Department of Parliamentary Services says it doesn\u2019t believe politicians or parliament employees need to avoid downloading apps like TikTok to their work phones, despite such recommendations being made in other parliaments.\nAppearing before a Senate estimates committee hearing on Monday afternoon, Liberal senator James Paterson \u2013 who has long raised concerns about security concerns about the Chinese-owned social media app \u2013 noted that parliaments in New Zealand and the United States had warned against the use of TikTok on political phones.\nA DPS official said they were aware of that advice from overseas equivalents, but hadn\u2019t received similar recommendations that Australia should follow suit:\n\nWe work closely with our partners at the five parliaments, the other parliaments around the world, and my understanding of that advice they provided is it was related to specific advice they\u2019d received from other agencies in their country and we haven\u2019t received an equivalent level of advice to us that would warrant us to be providing that advice to parliamentarians.\n\nPaterson, chair of the parliament\u2019s intelligence and security committee under the previous government, noted some federal departments had given such advice to their employees to not use TikTok on work phones.\nDPS said it did not make similar recommendations, and said it had not recommended employees or politicians only use social media on a personal (not work) device.\nFor some background:\n\n\nUpdated at 5.04am GMT\n\n\n 4.50am  \n\nDon\u2019t take any easing of those Melbourne storms as evidence they\u2019ve gone away, either:\n\n\n\n\n 4.43am  \nBureau issues severe thunderstorm warning for parts of Melbourne\n\nThe Bureau of Meteorology has issued a severe thunderstorm warning, with flash flooding likely in Melbourne\u2019s inner west.\n\nMetro Trains is already reporting that the subway at Ascot Vale station is inaccessible as it\u2019s full of water.\n\n\nUpdated at 4.51am GMT\n\n\n 4.40am  \n\nIn Estimates, the Australian government solicitor, Michael Kingston, has revealed fresh details of the public interest immunity claim that resulted in Afghanistan whistleblower David McBride withdrawing his Public Interest Disclosure Act defence.\nKingston said the claim was made by the Department of Defence way back in June 2021 but new correspondence on 18 October 2022 qualified the claim by identifying eight documents (two whole documents, and sections of six others) and asserting public-interest immunity over them.\nThe claim is designed to protect confidential information where disclosure would harm the public interest \u2013 such as security, defence or international relations of Australia and the proper functioning of a government.\nAdvocates are still pressuring the attorney general, Mark Dreyfus, to discontinue the prosecution.\nFor some background on this case:\n\n\nUpdated at 4.54am GMT\n\n\n 4.29am  \n\nMinister pays tribute to outgoing president of Fair Work Commission\nThe minister for employment and workplace relations, Tony Burke, has released a statement regarding the resignation of Justice Iain Ross from the Fair Work Commission, as we noted earlier. Burke describes him a \u201cman of great intellect and integrity\u201d, saying his tenure has been \u201coutstanding\u201d.\n\nHis commitment to fairness, decency and justice hasn\u2019t wavered in his ten years on the Commission.\nHis open and transparent approach has been an enormous asset \u2013 working in the interests of both workers and employers.\nJustice Ross has served governments on both sides of politics and he is held in high regard by all.\nHe\u2019s maintained the reputation of the Commission in the eyes of the public during turbulent times, particularly the lockdown period of the pandemic.\nThe Fair Work Commission is an institution the Australian people rely on and trust. As president, Justice Ross has cemented that trust.\n\nBurke also charges Ross with some responsibility for fruit pickers receiving a minimum hourly wage, the government\u2019s legislation for 10 days of family and domestic violence leave and other pay increases to workers.\n\nUpdated at 4.34am GMT\n\n\n 4.21am  \n\nKristy McBain, the minister for regional development, local government and territories has been speaking just now about flooding assistance, but there isn\u2019t very much new in there \u2013 she\u2019s just noting that a bunch of disaster payments have been made today and referring to the various other supports the government has put in place.\n\nUpdated at 4.37am GMT\n\n\n 4.14am  \n\nThere\u2019s a dixer to the assistant treasurer, Stephen Jones, about scams \u2013 which descends into an attack on the opposition:\nJones:\n\nYes we have a lot of work to do to protect people who have disadvantage and who are vulnerable to scams but it is not just them. From the highest of those in the country to the public in the regions, all have fallen victim to scams. Crypto scams, romance scams, investment scams, invoice-interception scams. This is a legacy that we have inherited.\nThe member for Deakin has had a fair bit to say throughout question time. He has just gone quiet. There is a very good reason that he has gone quiet. This issue is beyond politics. But it is not beyond incompetence and it is not beyond indifference. On his watch it doubled and then it doubled again. The member for Deakin had more people working on branch-stacking in his office. This is his legacy! This is his legacy! No wonder he had so much to say.\n\n\nUpdated at 4.27am GMT\n\n\n 4.06am  \n\nThere\u2019s some argy-bargy now about whether or not the PM is answering a question about gas prices. Peter Dutton claims he is not; Albanese claims he is.\nDutton:\n\nThe question was: prime minister, at your budget how much will gas prices go up by? Mr Speaker, he refuses to answer a basic question.\n\nAlbanese:\n\nI am certainly talking about gas which is what the question is about. Not the gas coming from those opposite. But the gas in the system that we need. And what we used to have was, we used to have questions of the minister...\n\nThere\u2019s commotion.\nAlbanese:\n\nHe\u2019s yelling. He is very angry, Mr Speaker.\n\n\nUpdated at 4.23am GMT\n\n\n 4.01am  \n\nThe prime minister, Anthony Albanese, has just finished speaking in response to a question about the government\u2019s desire to host the 2026 COP \u2013 despite Australia being \u201cone of the biggest fossil fuel exporters, with a further 114 new coal and gas projects in the pipeline.\u201d Will he now commit to not opening any new coal or gas projects?\nAlbanese:\n\nThe government will be implementing the plan that we took to the election, our Powering Australia plan and our plan to reduce emissions by 43% by 2030. Our plan to engage with our Pacific neighbours. At the Pacific Islands Forum, which the prime minister hosted in Fiji, it was clear to me that the entry card to get into discussions around the globe is action on climate change, is taking climate change seriously. The fact is that the communique from that summit, from the Pacific Islands Forum welcome the Australian government\u2019s new position, welcomed it.\n\nIt goes on much like this. No commitment, in other words.\n\nUpdated at 4.08am GMT\n\n\n 3.57am  \n\nLovely readers, this is Stephanie Convery \u2013 I\u2019m just jumping in unexpectedly because poor Amy Remeikis has lost internet at her house thanks to a big storm.

Do you agree that real effective wage rises in low-paid industries can be achieved through the awards as has been shown this week in the aged care awards, rather than through complex IR read legislation not taken to the election, delaying wage rises in protective negotiations?\n\nAnthony Albanese:\n\nI will start and ask the minister [for employment and workplace relations, Tony Bourke] to continue as well. I thank the member for Wentworth for her question and constructive engagement in this house. I think it is, though not credible to say to say that we did not take our policy to lift wages to the election.\nWe were very very clear, very very clear we would make clear that we would want to lift the wages and make submissions to those about those on minimum wage and the aged care workforce.\nWe were clear that we would make secure work an objective of the Fair Work Act. We were very clear that we would make gender-pay equity an objective of the Fair Work Act.\nOne of the things that is very clear on why we need to change the industrial relations system is that not only had real wages gone backwards over the previous decade, as a deliberate policy of the then-government, is that the feminised industries \u2013 people like our cleaners, our early learning educators, our aged care worker is, our disability care workers \u2013 have copped the brunt of the holding back of wages in this country.\nThat is why a fairer country deserves a fairer industrial relations system. That is what our secure work better pay bill will do. We believe there is a need to reform the system.\nThat was something we took and engaged very much with business and continue to do so, as well as with the unions.\nWe did so at the jobs and skills summit here. It is one of the challenges we need to meet and the Reserve Bank Governor made it clear that we need to lift wages, that it was something holding back the economy. And that is why our legislation is worthy of support by this parliament, because we believe very clearly we have a mandate for it\u2026\n\nTony Burke:\n\nI thank the member for Wentworth in the way she has engaged with this debate and the further conversations that are yet to happen. I do have to note as to why we do not just rely on the reward system \u2013 people with enterprise agreements [get paid] more and get more flexibility and productivity. They do provide a better outcome but are largely less available if you are a small business or medium-sized business unless available if it is a feminised workforce. If you deliver the pay rise in productivity, it is a much better outcome.\n\n\nUpdated at 4.57am GMT\n\n\n 3.28am  \n\nLiberal party deputy leader, Sussan Ley, has a prop (I think it is a front page) as she continues to find her groove as the opposition\u2019s attacker-in-chief and Milton Dick (who was once thrown out of question time for using muppets as a prop) immediately tells her to lose the paper.\nShe does not.\nLey:\n\nMy question is to the prime minister and I refer the prime minister to the front page of the Australian on May 2, 2022, entitled Life will be cheaper under me, when the prime minister says that Labor has lasting plans to cheaper mortgages and electricity and given they confirmed it will rise 55% and interest rates have gone up six times since the election, how can the prime minister seriously suggest that life is cheaper under Labor? Why won\u2019t he say sorry for yet another broken promise?\n\nDick is annoyed. Perhaps Ley could consider bringing in a muppet?\n\nI specifically asked you not to use a prop and if she does it again shall be asked to leave the house. I cannot be clearer than that. That goes to every member in the house.\n\nNice try! I give the call to the prime minister.\nAlbanese:\n\nThank you, Mr Speaker, I always read the front page of the Australian and I read the front page of every paper in the country to try to keep on top of where things are. A couple weeks later, in May, in May, the first interest rate increase occurred by the Reserve Bank and I thought they were in government at that point in time. But what we also know there was also scheduled to be an increase in energy prices, in wholesale prices, at the same time. But I didn\u2019t get to read about that on the front page of the Australian. I didn\u2019t get to read about it! I wonder why that is the case?\nBecause it was scheduled to occur, scheduled to occur, during the campaign, just like the interest-rate increase occurred during the campaign but when you know about one but we didn\u2019t know about the other one. When knew about one but not the other.\nAnd we do not know about the other because someone, someone...\nWho? Who was that! Someone, ... someone introduced, actually introduced a change in the law so that, so that people could not know that there was this wholesale price scheduled to occur.\nWhy would they do that?\nAnd what date did they pick?\nWhat date did they pick? Because election was on May 21 so did they pick the day before May 21 or after May 21? Hands up those who think they pick the day after? Hands up those who think they pick the day after? You are all correct. They pick the day after because they were not transparent. They were not transparent about what they had intended and what they had intended as a result of this...\n\n(Hands up never works well in this parliament)\nBefore the opposition can object, Albanese decides he has concluded his answer.\n\nUpdated at 3.44am GMT\n\n\n 3.21am  \nQuestion time begins\n\nPeter Dutton:\n\nMy question is to the prime minister. Last week I met with Louis and Tess who run a Cafe in Fairfield. They were promised that the Labor government would bring down power prices by $275 a year. They are facing a 56 per cent rise in power prices over the next two years and are forced to take measures like turning off the air conditioning to try and rein in surging costs. Will the prime minister apologise to families and businesses like the one Louis and Tess run for not delivering on his $275 commitment cut electricity prices?\n\nAnthony Albanese:\n\nI thank the leader of the opposition for his question. We stand by the evidence which is that renewables are the cheapest form of power. And the best way to get power prices down is to get renewables up. And that is exactly what this budget has done. Nearly $24 billion for clean energy investing in renewable energies, offshore wind, pumped hydro, community batteries and solar banks. All of it making up for a decade of neglect, a decade of denial, a decade of chaos.\nWe had on those opposite\u2019s watch four gigawatts leave the system and one gigawatt come in.\nThat is what occurred. From those opposite. Common sense tells you that with demand and supply, if you have less supply, but demand is going up then you will have pressure when it comes to prices.\nBut, of course, those opposite were too busy fighting for power amongst themselves to worry about generating power for the country. That is essentially the problem that occurred. That is essentially the problem that occurred. They had a rotation of ministers, they had every time that we had the potential of an energy policy being adopted, even ones that could\u2019ve adopted with bipartisan support, instead of adopting them they rolled the leader. That is what occurred. They were too busy worrying about their own power squabbles.\n\nPaul Fletcher steps in:\n\nMr Speaker on relevance. I ask that you follow in the tradition of Speaker Jenkins and direct the prime minister to make the material to the question at hand not some kind of historical explosion. He is looking for every reason to avoid answering the question.\n\nTony Burke counters:\n\nTo the point of order, this was hardly the type of question that went for the full 30 seconds available and asked what the impacts were on a cafe in Fairfield electricity prices. The prime minister is going to exactly why there is pressure on those families and those households and right now.\n\nDick says the PM is in order and we move on\n\nThank you very much Mr Speaker. Of course, what we know is that there are two big reasons why there are pressure on prices at the moment. One of which is I have outlined already, the failure of those opposite to actually build enough supply to generate power in the country, because they were too busy worried about power struggles within themselves. By the second of course, is \u2013 and this might be a news release for those opposite \u2013 the fact of the Russian invasion of Ukraine has led to global power prices rising that has occurred throughout the entire world. It seems oblivious to those opposite that this has occurred, but it is just a fact.\n\n\nUpdated at 3.36am GMT\n\n\n 3.17am  \nFair Work Commission boss retires\n\nThe head of the Fair Work Commission, Justice Iain Ross, has announced his retirement, effective 18 November.\nRoss, who has served 10 years and 8 months as president, was a federal court judge appointed to head the industrial tribunal during the Gillard government.\nIn a statement to FWC staff, Ross said:\n\n\u201cWe have recently concluded the review of modern awards; our digitalisation strategy is on track and we are meeting or exceeding all of our performance targets. Of course there is always more to be done. But at some point all things end. And for me, now is the right time. We are in good shape as an institution and are well placed to successfully implement any legislative change determined by parliament. Leaving now will mean that whoever is chosen as my successor will be fully involved in the implementation of those changes from the outset, rather than splitting that responsibility between myself and the next president. I think it is in the interests of the institution that there is continuity of leadership through the implementation of any legislative change.\u201d\n\nRoss\u2019 replacement will be one of the most significant appointments the Albanese government will make: with power over annual minimum wage reviews, award reviews and equal pay cases. The Fair Work Commission is an extremely powerful body, setting pay and conditions for millions of Australians.\nJust on Friday the FWC awarded a 15% pay increase to workers in the aged care sector.\n\n\nUpdated at 3.26am GMT\n\n\n 3.05am  \n\nAhead of question time is a condolence motion for the Liberal minister Tony Street.

That information seemed a bit unlikely since workers, suppliers etc would have been laid off, news that would have surfaced by now.)\nNow, Snowy isn\u2019t the most open of organisations, and that tradition seems to have continued in the wake of the resignation of Whitby\u2019s predecessor Paul Broad in late August. Perhaps ironically, Broad\u2019s exit followed issues over communication and transparency, Whitby said.\nAsked repeatedly by Senator Malcolm Roberts (who told estimates he too had worked underground; no comment) about how much 2.0 would cost, and when it would be completed, Whitby did eventually state the $5.9bn cost they had said previously remained the budget.\nParts of the work, though, were \u201c12 months behind program\u201d, Whitby conceded.\nThe work is no doubt challenging. The underground power plant is 800m below the surface and will require, he said, a cavern carved out that is 250m long, 80m high and 50m wide.\nDigging may yet accelerate (as is sometimes the case in such tunnelling). However, Snowy has not told the Australian Energy Market Operator formally of any delay (as AEMO confirmed to us today).\nThey still have December 2026 pencilled in for the commissioning of 2.0 - while adding \u201csensitivity\u201d forecasts that adjust supply projections just in case 2.0 is delayed (as is likely).\nMeanwhile, senators remain a bit sceptical about when the 750-megawatt Kurri Kurri gas plant might begin operation - and when it might be able to burn hydrogen and not just fossil gas. (Labor policy is for it to run entirely on hydrogen by 2030.)\nAnyway, Kurri Kurri is supposed to go online by the end of 2023. That\u2019s still the timetable even though flooding of the worksite has prompted construction delays. Snowy Hydro, though, continues to work towards a completion rate on time.\nWhich might be one stretch-target for whoever gets the formal CEO gig.\n\nUpdated at 3.20am GMT\n\n\n 2.46am  \n\nFlinders Liberal MP Zoe McKenzie says there will be no hold-up in passing the Respect@Work legislation through the parliament.\nShe told the ABC:\n\nThere was amendment on the floor of the house today, which likely goes to implementation, things like which is the proper body to investigate some kind of behaviour. There was a discussion about whether that should be the Fair Work Ombudsman or indeed the Human Rights Commission. I think there is broad support across the parliament for this change. A great piece of work done in the previous government, great work done by Kate Jenkins.\n\nJust a disagreement about the right organisation for investigations. Otherwise I think it will go through.\n\nUpdated at 2.54am GMT\n\n\n 2.26am  \n\nThings have been a little quiet this morning, which is usual for Monday.

That we have come this far as a society, and that\u2019s it.\nLet\u2019s make these changes and move forward with our national story.\nMr Speaker, we live in the greatest nation on earth.\nBut there is an even greater nation within our reach.\nThanks to the courage of every victim-survivor who stepped forward, we have no reason not to reach it.\nThey have shown the way.\nAnd it is something we should all embrace as part of the determination we share to shape Australia into the very best version it can be \u2013 a nation that reflects our highest ideals.\nI know that together we can build a better future, one with equality and respect at its core.\n\n\nUpdated at 2.24am GMT\n\n\n 2.15am  \n\nAnthony Albanese on introduction to parliament of the Kate Jenkins report\nThe remaining recommendations from Kate Jenkins\u2019 Respect at Work report which need legislation have been introduced to the parliament.\nThe PM has given a speech on the bill\u2019s introduction:\nThe bill will:\n\nPlace a positive duty on employers to take reasonable and proportionate measures to eliminate sex discrimination, sexual harassment and victimisation, as far as possible;\nGive the Australian Human Rights Commission new powers to enforce the positive duty, to help make sure employers are meeting their obligations;\nExpressly prohibit conduct that results in a hostile workplace environment on the basis of sex; and\nEnsure Commonwealth public sector organisations are also required to report to the Workplace Gender Equality Agency on its gender equality indicators.\n\nYou can read Katharine Murphy\u2019s preview of the report here:\n\n\nUpdated at 2.35am GMT\n\n\n 2.10am  \n\nRecord low grid demand but pain at the petrol pump\nWith a lot of wind and sun around yesterday and the generally mild temperatures on a Sunday, there was a good chance that the national electricity demand would drop to fresh lows.\nAnd voila: a record low for demand in the NEM - by more than 5%.\n\nWith more solar panels sprouting on rooftops by the day, it was also not a surprise that the share of renewable energy continues to creep higher. At the time of the record demand low, almost half the power was coming from rooftop PV, the Australian Energy Market Operator noted.\nContrast that with what awaits the motorist at the service station. Of late, petrol prices in many places have spiked above $2 a litre - with of course the end of the excise \u201choliday\u201d at the end of September adding about 25c/l. (Servos, though, were careful to phase back the increase.)\nWhat\u2019s also a factor is the fattening of the margin between wholesale and retail prices, according to the Australian Petroleum Institute. (Not great for CPI, either.)\n\nWith the next week looking dry for most of Australia most of the time (sorry Victoria, there\u2019s a bit more rain heading your way in a few days), more than a few people will be wondering why they don\u2019t have an electric vehicle powered by solar PV.\n\nUpdated at 2.17am GMT\n\n\n 2.09am  \n\nIR bill continued \u2026\nSo there have been some compromises. Tony Burke says:\nBut we\u2019ve been happy to listen to feedback about how to make sensible improvements to the practical application of the Bill. After additional consultations the Government has drafted a number of amendments we will move in the House this week, including:\n\nRequiring majority support from employees of each employer for a single interest bargaining stream authorisation;\nProvide that businesses and workers cannot be compelled into an authorisation or single interest employer agreement when they have agreed to bargain for a proposed single enterprise agreement, and a 6 month grace period where there is a history of effective bargaining;\nMaking further changes to the Better Off Overall Test to ensure new employees under an agreement are not left worse off;\nClarifying that the Fair Work Commission must be satisfied a minimum period of good-faith bargaining has occurred before moving to arbitrate;\nEstablish the Government\u2019s promised new National Construction Industry Forum as a statutory advisory body;\nGiving business 12 months to adjust to changes to fixed-term contracts.\n\n\nUpdated at 2.15am GMT\n\n\n 2.08am  \n\nTony Burke has released a statement on the IR bill\n\nThe Albanese Labor Government will adopt a range of amendments to the Secure Jobs, Better Pay Bill after a week of constructive consultations with business groups, unions and experts.\nThis bill is essential and urgent. It will promote job security, help close the gender pay gap, modernise the workplace bargaining system and get wages moving after a decade of stagnation.\nAustralians are struggling with the rising cost of living. Their wages are not keeping up with prices, and it\u2019s clear the Government has to intervene to increase access to bargaining and close the loopholes undermining wage growth.\nThe Government made a clear commitment to the Australian people at the election to get wages moving.\nThat won\u2019t happen automatically. To get wages moving we need to modernise our workplace laws.\nOne of the Government\u2019s top priorities is to fix the ailing bargaining system and get more people on to enterprise agreements.\nWorkers on agreements benefit from better pay and conditions \u2013 and employers on agreements benefit from better productivity. But today only 14.7 per cent of workers are on in-date agreements. The system isn\u2019t working.\nSingle enterprise agreements will remain the primary form of agreement and this Bill makes important improvements to get more people on to single enterprise agreements.\nWe\u2019re also opening up the multi-employer pathway for people who haven\u2019t been able to access single enterprise agreements, particularly low-paid workers in female-dominated industries. For too long they have been left out of the benefits of bargaining.\nThis is a critical element of the Government\u2019s plan to get wages moving and close the gender pay gap. We will not compromise on the principle of getting wages moving and getting them moving quickly.\n\n\nUpdated at 2.14am GMT\n\n\n 2.01am  \n\nMore on the migration review\nYou can find the terms of reference for the migration review, here.\nBut the scope of the review will be to:\nIdentify the reforms needed to create a simple, efficient migration system that can effectively:\n- Enrich the economy, with a focus on productivity growth;\n- Complement Australia\u2019s education and training systems and the skills of Australians - Unlock the potential of migrants;\n- Help build Australia\u2019s sovereign capabilities and address challenges associated with the aging population, climate change and new technology;\n- Compete globally for highly skilled migrants, including by improving clients\u2019 experience of the immigration process;\n- Provide clear pathways to permanent residence and citizenship and reduce the exploitation of migrant workers; and \n- Foster enhanced integration (including people, trade and supply chain links) with our international friends and partners.\nThe Strategy will be informed by a review of the current visa framework, including both the temporary and permanent visa programs, and the processes and systems that support the administration of that framework.\nIn doing so, it will consider the current limitations and opportunities to reform the visa processing systems, including through digital platforms, trusted and secure identities, cyber security, and enhanced data analytics.\n\nUpdated at 2.04am GMT\n\n\n 1.50am  \n\nAustralians will welcome IR bill being law of the land \u2018come Christmas\u2019, assistant minister to PM says\nPatrick Gorman spoke to Sky News this morning about the timetable for the IR bill. It is very short. That is partly to head off the PR war and partly to tick it off before clearing the agenda for next year:\n\nI have great confidence in the processes that are under way in terms of making sure that there is a proper parliamentary process where there\u2019s committee scrutiny.\nWe\u2019re already seeing those crossbenchers engaged very deeply on the details, so they have had time to get across it and to see what is at stake here.\nAnd what is at stake is whether or not we find a path to get wages moving again for millions of Australians.\nWhat we know is, when we look at the enterprise bargaining system for people in aged care, childcare, it\u2019s not delivering the sort of outcomes that we need.\nAnd what we also know is there are a range of overdue reforms when it comes to things like properly prohibiting sexual harassment in the workplace. This bill acts on all of that and I think, again, there will be millions of working families in Australia who will welcome this legislation being the law of the land come Christmas this year.\n\n\nUpdated at 1.58am GMT\n\n\n 1.45am  \n\nJacinda Ardern is facing a very tough battle to get re-elected:\nJacinda Ardern rallies party faithful as Labour faces difficult reelection path \n\nUpdated at 1.50am GMT\n\n\n 1.23am  \n\nAG\u2019s department questioned on NSW and QLD blocking UN prison inspectors\nThe attorney general\u2019s department is being grilled about the NSW and Queensland government\u2019s decision to block UN inspectors from the torture sub-committee from inspecting their prison facilities.\nDepartmental secretary, Katherine Jones, said:\n\nWe were only notified on the day of the UN team arriving in Australia that NSW would not facilitate visits. All discussions we\u2019d been having with NSW to that date were about broader compliance with Opcat [Optional Protocol to the Convention Against Torture] and specifics around facilitating the visit. We had not been advised prior to that that NSW would not admit entry to sub-committee inspections.\u201d\n\nGreens senator David Shoebridge asked why the commonwealth did not clarify with NSW whether it would admit the inspectors in the two years of preparations for the visit.\nJones replied that the commonwealth \u201chad engaged with NSW and had been led to believe they\u2019d been preparing\u201d to admit the inspectors.\n\nUpdated at 1.33am GMT\n\n\n 1.23am  \n\nDavid Pocock on his call to split IR bill: not about \u2018delaying\u2019 but doing the job \u2018properly\u2019\nDavid Pocock \u2013 a key vote for the government for its IR bill \u2013 tweeted some of his thoughts about the bill a little bit ago:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated at 1.26am GMT\n\n\n 1.18am  \n\nScammers expected to cost Australians $4bn this year\nScammers cost Australians $2bn last year.

At a time when Australians are already struggling with cost of living increases, this is just going to hit them out of the park. More needs to be done. More will be done. Today, we\u2019re announcing that we\u2019ll implement our election commitment for a new anti-scam centre set up inside the ACCC. But we\u2019ll also be rolling out new industry codes. We\u2019ll be putting in place some significant review and changes to the anti-privacy laws, which are woefully out of date. And a big job of work also needs to be done to make it easier for people who have had their identities stolen to repair those IDs and ensure that they aren\u2019t victims of a subsequent scam. So, a lot of work to be done, but when you look at those numbers moving from $2 billion to $4 billion, we can\u2019t afford to have another year where there\u2019s no action on this.\n\n\nUpdated at 1.22am GMT\n\n\n 1.07am  \n\nLiberal senator \u2018gobsmacked\u2019 about draft question for Indigenous voice referendum\nStill in estimates, AAP has a story on Liberal senator Paul Scarr being \u201cstaggered\u201d and \u201cgobsmacked\u201d (he seems to use these words a lot tbf) that Anthony Albanese didn\u2019t receive legal advice from the Attorney-General\u2019s Department before unveiling a draft referendum question for an Indigenous voice to parliament.\nAAP:\nGovernment officials confirmed the lack of advice at Senate estimates on Monday, drawing scathing criticism from Liberal senator Paul Scarr who described himself as \u201cstaggered\u201d and \u201cgobsmacked\u201d.\nBut minister Murray Watt was quick to defend the prime minister\u2019s action, saying the statement he made in July was only intended as a draft and required further consultation.\nAlbanese revealed the draft question at the Garma Festival: \u201cDo you support an alteration to the constitution that establishes an Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander voice?\u201d\nSenator Watt said there was no suggestion it was the exact question Australians would be asked to answer at the ballot box.\n\u201cThese are proposed words that have been put forward by the prime minister, they are not necessarily the finished product,\u201d he said.\n\u201cWhen he made the announcement, he referred to them as a starting point and we welcome discussion from all members of the public.\u201d\nSenator Scarr said he found the lack of legal consultation \u201cextraordinary\u201d.\n\u201cI would expect ... given the significance of the prime minister tabling an amendment to our constitution would actually seek advice from the Attorney-General\u2019s Department with respect to the wording,\u201d he said.\n\u201cI\u2019m absolutely staggered; I\u2019m gobsmacked, to be frank.\u201d\nConstitutional law office general counsel David Lewis agreed with the minister the statement was for draft purposes and didn\u2019t necessarily need legal advice.\n\u201cThose words were very similar to some words that have been \u2026 developed by a number of groups and publicly available for a number of years,\u201d he said.\n\u201cWhen the prime minister announced those words, he said this is a draft for discussion \u2026 I expect there\u2019ll be further discussion before the draft is finalised.\u201d\nEarlier, Indigenous Australians minister Linda Burney addressed Noel Pearson\u2019s statement First Nations people were \u201cmuch unloved\u201d and a referendum may fail due to \u201cprejudice, contempt and violence of the past\u201d.\n\u201cHe is right in the sense that with the equal marriage plebiscite, a lot of people knew people that would be directly affected by this \u2026 I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the case so much with Aboriginal people,\u201d Burney told the ABC.\n\u201cBut the great thing is Noel also described the voice as a bridge to unite, at long last, First Peoples and the rest of the country and that to me is where we should focus.\u201d\n\nUpdated at 1.13am GMT\n\n\n 12.54am  \n\n\u2018Defining politicisation\u2019 is a challenge, secretary of AG\u2019s department says\nThe Greens senator David Shoebridge has asked whether the Attorney-General\u2019s Department has done any of its own analysis to verify claims about the politicisation of administrative appeals tribunal appointments.\nThe AGD secretary, Katherine Jones, suggests that the department \u201cbroadly support the government of the day\u201d in terms of appointment processes for tribunals and courts.\nJones avoids being drawn into discussions about previous appointments, saying \u201cdefining politicisation\u201d can be a challenge.\nBut she says the current attorney general, Mark Dreyfus, has \u201casked us to work\u201d on implementing a new process for \u201ctransparent, merit based\u201d appointments to the AAT.\nShoebridge is also asking about the \u201cextraordinarily excessive fees\u201d of bringing challenges against AAT decisions at a federal court.\nThe minister at the table, Murray Watt, says the AAT requires a \u201csignificant overhaul\u201d:\n\nThe government considers that the AAT is broken in a range of ways \u2026 and we have a review process under way.\n\n\nUpdated at 12.59am GMT\n\n\n 12.43am  \n\nClare O\u2019Neil: \u2018Some of the best and brightest\u2019 people want to come to Australia\nHere is a little more from what Clare O\u2019Neil was saying this morning about the review into Australia\u2019s migration systems on ABC radio\u2019s RN Breakfast:\n\nIf there\u2019s systemic abuses, I can\u2019t honestly say that and that\u2019s why the government is so seriously trying to look at this system. It has been without question the subject of neglect for nine years and we\u2019ve got to make sure, number one, that we address the issues around criminality that are being alleged here by the media at the moment. But that we also get the opportunity here \u2013 and this is a really important piece of the puzzle, PK \u2013 you would have people on your show all the time talking to you about their frustrations about dealing with the migration system. We\u2019ve got some of the best and brightest people around the world who want to come here and make Australia their home and we\u2019re making them wait for sometimes years at a time to get in the door when countries that we\u2019re competing with like Canada are essentially rolling out the red carpet and getting people to come through.\nSo we\u2019ve got two issues here.

Additionally, references to a \u2018secret intelligence briefing\u2019 from the Office of National Intelligence (312] would appear to be contrary to the confidentiality of information from the intelligence and security agencies.\nDisclosures of Cabinet discussions and deliberations undermine Cabinet confidentiality and solidarity.

Well, I\u2019m sure your listeners are going to check that one in their power bill. As you move towards your targets, which they\u2019ve legislated \u2013 they\u2019ve legislated carbon targets \u2013 you\u2019re going to become poorer. It\u2019s going to put pressure on manufacturing jobs. The price of power goes up. The price of fuel goes up. The price of food goes up. Ultimately, as I\u2019ve always said, the bunny in the headlights is your listeners. They\u2019re the one who\u2019s pay for this.\nAnd what we\u2019re saying, Chris Bowen going over to Sharm el Sheikh and, you know, it will be a wonderful resort, we\u2019re seeing \u2013 the Labor party doesn\u2019t really have anybody who really worked in the manufacturing industry, who worked as manufacturing workers. And they are now saying they will lose up to 100,000 of them.\nAnd the final thing is, Tanya, you\u2019re the government. Stop talking about the previous government*. You\u2019re the government.

It comes after traditional owners won their case with the UN, which argued they should be compensated for climate crisis failures.\nKabay Tamu, Warraber man from the Kulkalgal Nation and claimant in the UN case said:\n\nBy building a seawall outside Parliament House, we urge the Albanese government to protect our island homes, as the international community exhorts them to take stronger action on climate change at Cop27.\nRising seas are threatening our homes, swamping burial grounds and washing away sacred cultural sites. If the government fails to take enough action, we could be removed from these islands we have called home for thousands of years. Removing a race of people from our islands is like colonisation all over again for us.

Lambie said it was \u201cembarrassing\u201d for the government that even unions didn\u2019t have their submissions done by a Friday Senate hearing.\n\nLambie said concessions made by workplace relations minister Tony Burke only water down some aspects of the multi-employer bargaining provisions, but she has concerns about whether the bill will make it harder for small and medium businesses recovering from Covid.\nLambie said that the abolition of the Australian Building and Construction Commission is a sticking point for her. She said it was \u201cworking well\u201d and if the government has problems with the body being anti-union it should replace personnel not abolish the body.\nAsked if medium-sized employers should be allowed to opt out of multi-employer bargaining, Lambie replied that \u201canyone should be able to opt out ... regardless of size\u201d.\nLambie is in favour of senator David Pocock\u2019s proposal to split the IR bill.\n\nUpdated at 11.23pm GMT\n\n\n 10.05pm  \n\nMigration system review will focus on process\nFor those wondering, here is a little more detail on the migration review Clare O\u2019Neil announced this morning.\nFormer public service chief Martin Parkinson will head the review, along with temporary labour migration expert Joanna Howe and John Azarias, a former partner with Deloitte.\nIt will look at the visa system, how it works and what improvements need to be made, as well as things like the income threshold. But it won\u2019t be looking at population size or anything too political. That\u2019s because the government wants the focus to be on the system.\nAnd in terms of politics, O\u2019Neil and the government are more than capable of pointing fingers (as is the opposition).\nSo the review is about process, not politics.\nDoes that mean the findings will be non-political?\nI think we all know the answer to that.\n\nUpdated at 10.09pm GMT\n\n\n 9.47pm  \n\nMedibank provides update on customer data accessed in cyber-attack\nHere is what Medibank reported in terms of what it knows the cyber criminal accessed:\n\nAccessed the name, date of birth, address, phone number and email address for around 9.7 million current and former customers and some of their authorised representatives.

Medibank has today announced that no ransom payment will be made to the criminal responsible for this data theft.\nKoczkar said:\n\nBased on the extensive advice we have received from cybercrime experts we believe there is only a limited chance paying a ransom would ensure the return of our customers\u2019 data and prevent it from being published. In fact, paying could have the opposite effect and encourage the criminal to directly extort our customers, and there is a strong chance that paying puts more people in harm\u2019s way by making Australia a bigger target.\nIt is for these reasons we have decided we will not pay a ransom for this event.\n\nThis decision is consistent with the position of the Australian government.\n\n\nUpdated at 11.32pm GMT\n\n\n 9.41pm  \nMedibank will not pay ransom to hackers\n\nMedibank have made another announcement to the ASX confirming they will not pay the ransom hackers have demanded not to release information from its data breach.\n\nUpdated at 9.44pm GMT\n\n\n 9.27pm  \n\nMultiple bills to be debated heading into Senate\u2019s final two weeks\nIt\u2019s going to be a big week in the house \u2013 the Respect@Work legislation is set to be introduced today with the privacy changes in response to the data breaches to be introduced tomorrow.

(The court may make orders as to costs as they consider \u201cjust\u201d where \u201cthere are circumstances that justify it in doing so\u201d.)\nThe letter explains:\nWhile superficially the arrangement represents an improvement on the status quo, its design and uncertainty around its operation will in fact serve to undermine access to justice. The proposed model will ultimately make it harder for targets of sexual harassment to vindicate their legal rights; it will deter women from pursuing cases and reduce the compensation that they will achieve if they do proceed.\nTaking a costs neutrality approach to a relationship that is characterised by endemic inequality only serves to entrench that inequality. The proposed approach will also make it uneconomical for law firms to offer no-win, no-fee arrangements in discrimination matters and make it unviable to bring class actions against employers.\nWe urge you to amend the Bill to include an \u201cequal access\u201d asymmetrical costs model. Such an approach would protect a complainant from an adverse costs order, unless they have acted vexatiously or unreasonably, but enable them to recover costs should they succeed. This model would recognise the significant inequality in resources between complainants in sexual harassment matters and their employers. It would also underscore the wider public interest in those who have been sexually harassed vindicating their legal rights.\nOther signatories to the letter include Shine Lawyers, Grata Fund, Public Interest Advocacy Centre, Australian Council of Trade Unions, and Australian Women Lawyers Ltd.\n\nUpdated at 8.54pm GMT\n\n\n 8.45pm  \nGood morning\n\nWelcome back to parliament.\nThere are only three scheduled house sitting weeks left \u2013 and just eight days for the Senate, which will spend this week in budget estimates.\nSo no legislation is getting passed this week. But that doesn\u2019t mean we aren\u2019t going to see some legislative fights.\nTony Burke and the government really want to see the IR bill get through the parliament and have set a very tight timeline to make it happen. So far Burke has compromised on a couple of sticking points \u2013 including changing multi-employer bargaining from a majority across the sector to a majority in each business. There is also potential for the government to move on the introduction of the changes, with talk of a six-month grace period in the works.\nBut the government will have to spend this week trying to win over a Senate crossbencher or two. Jacqui Lambie and David Pocock are the two most likely and so far neither are budging.\nMeanwhile, Labor senators will find themselves on the other side of the table this week as Senate estimates gets under way in earnest. The Coalition are intent in poking holes in the budget and in particular anything to do with the cost of living, so that\u2019s going to be a long week for some of the Labor ministers.\nAnd it\u2019s all playing out in the shadow of the 27th Cop, being held in Egypt. Anthony Albanese isn\u2019t there \u2013 Chris Bowen is.\nAustralia doesn\u2019t have much new to say, but Adam Morton will be covering what the meeting decides \u2013 as well as poking into some of the schemes meant to improve Australia\u2019s position.\n\nYou have Katharine Murphy, Sarah Martin, Paul Karp, Josh Butler and Daniel Hurst watching all the happenings in Parliament House for you and the entire Guardian brains trust watching what\u2019s happening outside of Canberra.\nAmy Remeikis is with you on the blog for most of the day.\nReady?

                    "body": "The television in the club house at Coalville Town was tuned into BBC2 and all eyes were on Alan Smith and Dion Dublin as they prepared to make the draw for the first round of the FA Cup. \u201cWe were No 61 and Charlton were No 11,\u201d says Jake Eggleton, recalling that Monday night last month. \u201cWhen No 11 came out and we waited to see who\u2019d they play, all I could think was: \u2018Let it be 61, it\u2019s got to be 61.\u2019 When it was us, the whole place went mental. It was a wow moment. It felt fantastic, unbelievable, amazing.\u201d As a lifelong Charlton fan, the Coalville defender had even more reason than most to celebrate a draw which will transport his seventh-tier, Leicestershire-based team to The Valley on Saturday. \u201cAfter the draw my mum said she just knew we\u2019d get Charlton,\u201d says Eggleton. \u201cShe said she just felt it was meant to be. But it also means that, for the first time, she and dad are going to be in the away end at The Valley.\u201d  As a boy growing up in north Kent, Eggleton, now 24, belonged to a family of Charlton season-ticket holders and was part of the club\u2019s academy until his release at the age of eight. \u201cBut I kept my season ticket,\u201d he says. \u201cEven now, I\u2019m still a massive fan. Charlton\u2019s is the first result I look out for and I go and watch them whenever I can. If they\u2019re playing in the Midlands and Coalville haven\u2019t got a game, I\u2019ll be there.\u201d A boy who grew up idolising two Charlton strikers, first Darren Bent and then Yann Kermorgant, soon moved on to West Ham, doing so well that on 2 May 2015 he walked on to the Upton Park pitch at half time in a Premier League win against Burnley to sign a scholarship contract. One of the fellow academy prodigies next to Eggleton in photographs commemorating that landmark afternoon was Declan Rice. \u201cI played alongside Declan in the Under-18s,\u201d says Eggleton, who would be released by the club two years later. \u201cI haven\u2019t kept in touch with him so much but I\u2019ve still got friends at West Ham.  \u201cBeing there was a really good experience. I had a fantastic time, so leaving was hard. It had been a big part of my life for 10 years and, for a while, not being at West Ham any more was very difficult. For a period of about a year I fell out of love with football.\u201d After stints with non-league Hendon and then Hampton and Richmond Borough he began preparing for an alternative career and headed to Loughborough University, completing a degree in sport and exercise science this summer before immediately embarking on a Masters in strength and conditioning. \u201cSports science gives you a lot of options, both within football and outside it,\u201d says Eggleton. \u201cComing to Loughborough was one of the best decisions I\u2019ve made.\u201d During that initial degree course he started playing for the university\u2019s first XI and the qualities that had propelled him to Under-21 level at West Ham soon ensured he swiftly caught the eye of local scouts. \u201cWe played Coalville in pre-season and afterwards the manager [Adam Stevens] asked me if I\u2019d like to sign for him and I\u2019ve been here ever since,\u201d says the centre-back who is also comfortable at right-back. \u201cIt\u2019s been really good. There\u2019s a great sense of community. After games, we all go and have a few drinks with the supporters in the club house. It\u2019s been really nice to be able to get to know them.\u201d Semi-professional Coalville are one of several teams pushing for promotion from the Southern League Premier Division Central but a team who train two evenings a week emphasised their potential by winning 3-2 at fifth-tier Notts County in the fourth qualifying round last month.  The reward was a trip to League One Charlton where about 2,000 Ravens fans \u2013 Coalville\u2019s nickname derives from their origin in 1926 as Ravenstone Miners\u2019 Athletic \u2013 are expected to congregate at The Valley for their side\u2019s first appearance in the first round for 18 years. In November 2004, Coalville were widely regarded as somewhat unlucky to lose at Wycombe but Eggleton is not alone in believing that Saturday\u2019s tie against a former Premier League side at a famous 27,000-capacity stadium represents a somewhat bigger deal. There is also the reality that a defender cheered on by a sizeable contingent of family and friends will be back in the shop window. \u201cIf I got an opportunity to play professionally I\u2019d definitely give it a go,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I\u2019m not thinking about that at the moment. I just want to make the very most of Saturday\u2019s opportunity. \u201cI want to be sure I take it all in \u2026 and do my best to help Coalville play as well as we know we can. It\u2019s going to be really exciting.\u201d"

                    "body": "Rangers take on Eintracht Frankfurt in the Europa League final on Wednesday, an extraordinary achievement for a club in administration 10 years ago. This chance of glory is particularly remarkable given Rangers have triumphed in Europe on one previous occasion. Fifty years ago this month, they lifted the European Cup Winners\u2019 Cup in Barcelona after the most torrid, draining \u2013 and violent \u2013 football match I have attended. I fervently hope victory can be repeated but not, I pray, in similar circumstances.  In 1972, Rangers had been suffering a trophy drought that had lasted years with our great rivals, Celtic, managed by Jock Stein, monopolising Scotland\u2019s football silverware. As a young Rangers fan, I was to experience a great deal of disappointment. Europe offered a lifeline, however, and that season the team \u2013 managed by Willie Waddell \u2013 began a dramatic journey across the continent, albeit on an unorthodox route. Having dispatched Rennes in the first round, Rangers beat Sporting Lisbon 3-2 at Ibrox but lost by the same score in Portugal. In extra time each team scored another goal. Rangers should have progressed: away goals then counted double in the event of a tie, a rule that was bizarrely ignored by the Dutch referee Laurens van Ravens, who ordered a penalty shootout \u2013 which we lost. A purple-faced Waddell protested and Uefa officials backed down and awarded the tie to Rangers. Torino were beaten next, before Rangers took on Bayern Munich in the semi-final, drawing 1-1 in Germany before winning 2-0 at Ibrox against a squad that included Franz Beckenbauer and Gerd M\u00fcller. Now it was our turn to party. On 24 May, I flew to Barcelona with my friend Jan de Vries. We eschewed the delights of the Sagrada and the Palace of Catalan Music and chose instead to experience the city\u2019s cafe culture, swilling sangria in the mistaken belief it was mostly made of fruit juice and a dash of vermouth. In fact it was low on vitamin C and high on wine and brandy \u2013 which may explain a certain light-headedness we experienced as we headed to Camp Nou. Nor were we the only ones in that condition. On the other hand, we had no worries about rival fans. We were playing Dynamo Moscow in an era of Soviet travel bans. So Jan and I \u2013 along with the 20,000 Rangers fans who also made it to Camp Nou \u2013 had the stadium to ourselves. We posed for touchline photographs as the police looked on unconcerned. Rangers started the match at a pulsating pace. Colin Stein and then Willie Johnston scored. Then, minutes into the second half, goalkeeper Peter McCloy\u2019s massive punt upfield evaded the Moscow defence and Johnston smashed the ball hard and low past Vladimir Pilguy in the Dynamo goal.  Bedlam erupted. Jan picked me up and threw me into the air: a neat trick given that I am six foot tall, beefy and was also full of sangria. Three up \u2013 there was no way we could lose now. Dynamo began their fightback. Vladimir Eshtrekov scored; Dave Smith cleared the ball off our goalline; and with full time looming Aleksandr Mahovikov got a second. Our hold on the cup was hanging by a bootlace. Minutes later, the referee blew his whistle for a foul and thousands of fans invaded the pitch thinking the match was over. The pitch was cleared, the match restarted and eventually the final whistle was blown. Jubilant fans poured back on to the pitch, only to be assailed by rattled, baton-wielding police who had previously ignored our antics. Fans regrouped and fought back and as a full-scale battle unfolded Jan and I hurriedly left the stadium. By the time we reached Barcelona airport, check-in desks were surrounded by fans clutching bloody head wounds, purple bruises and torn clothes. Views about the religious persuasions of Spanish policemen were the main topic of conversation on the flight home. For the Rangers team there was no lap of honour and no showing off the cup at Camp Nou. The trophy was instead slipped to the captain, John Greig, in a backroom and he carried it home in his luggage. We got our first view of the trophy the following evening when Rangers, sporting the cup, toured Ibrox on the back of an old coal lorry that had been festooned with blue, red and white regalia.  Rangers were given a two-year European ban \u2013 later reduced to one year \u2013 because of their fans\u2019 behaviour. Was it deserved? Well, there was certainly some drunkenness but when we arrived the atmosphere in the city had been a happy carnival one. And there were no pitched battles with rival fans because there were none there to fight with. It was the sudden, panic-stricken actions of the police that was the main cause of the battle and that certainly did not justify a ban that meant Rangers could not defend the trophy they had played their hearts out to win. So yes, here is hoping for a similar result in Seville on Wednesday \u2013 but please let it be achieved in calmer conditions. Steering clear of the sangria might be a good start."

                    "body": "The Norwegian government has stepped in to end a strike that had threatened supplies of gas to Britain. The labour dispute had shut down oil and gasfields and was expected to cut Norway\u2019s gas supplies by almost 60% by the weekend. Gassco, Oslo\u2019s state-owned pipeline operator, had warned that \u201cin a worst-case scenario, deliveries to the UK could stop totally\u201d. Workers demanded a pay increase to handle rising inflation, which has been triggered in part by a jump in oil and gas prices since Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. However, the Norwegian government has the power to intervene to end industrial disputes. The country\u2019s labour minister, Marte Mj\u00f8s Persen, said: \u201cWhen the conflict can have such great social consequences for the whole of Europe, I have no choice but to intervene in the conflict.\u201d Gas prices had soared in recent days as the strike action threatened to exacerbate the existing supply crunch, but their rally was halted on Wednesday after the announcement. However, this respite from rising gas prices may be short lived, with the Nord Stream 1 gas pipeline from Russia to Germany scheduled for maintenance from 11-21 July. Goldman Sachs said it did not believe that flows through Nord Stream 1 would be completely restored after the work was completed. The investment bank raised its forecasts for European natural gas prices to average \u20ac153 per MW hour in the third quarter of 2022, \u20ac121 in the fourth quarter and \u20ac138 next summer. The Dutch wholesale gas contract for September delivery dropped 7.5% to \u20ac161 per MW hour on Wednesday. European countries have been scrambling to fill their gas storage sites before the winter for fear that Russia will cut off supplies altogether. Britain sources about a third of its gas from Norway and the remainder from a combination of the North Sea, other parts of Europe and imports of liquefied natural gas from the rest of the world, including the US.  Germany is far more reliant on Russian gas and fears are growing over the knock-on effect of Russia reducing gas supplies. The Deutsche Bank analyst Jim Reid said: \u201cEconomy minister [Robert] Habeck has talked about gas as potentially being a Lehman Brothers moment, so the stakes are high. Indeed, this is a heavy cloud hanging over European assets at the moment.\u201d Samuel Tombs, the chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said Britain could cope without Russian gas. He said: \u201cThe small hole that will be left by Russian imports falling to zero by the end of this year \u2013 as the UK government has pledged \u2013 should be covered easily by a pickup in liquefied natural gas imports from the US and Qatar.\u201d Separately on Wednesday, a Russian court told the Caspian Pipeline Consortium, which transfers oil from Kazakhstan to the Black Sea, to halt its activities for 30 days. The pipeline is one of the largest in the world and exports about 1.2m barrels a day. Despite the court order, exports are still flowing, Reuters reported."

                    "body": "Often the bridesmaid in big races this spring, jockey Mark Zahra was able to turn around his fortunes when triumphant aboard Gold Trip in the 2022 Melbourne Cup. Desperately unlucky when finishing second in the Caulfield Cup, the top-weight for the 162nd running of the famous race dashed clear in the straight for a decisive victory. The French-bred six-year-old, who started at 18-1, seized the lead 300 metres from the finish and was able to hold off Emissary, with stablemate High Emocean finishing third. Race favourite Deauville Legend looked the winner for a fleeting moment in the home straight but weakened to finish fourth behind Gold Trip, which carried 57.5kg to victory.  The triumph makes up for the devastation Zahra, 40, felt 12 months ago as he watched Verry Elleegant triumph while sidelined and also for the disappointment he experienced with a string of near misses over the past month. After finishing second in the Caulfield Cup on the Ciaron Maher and David Eustace-trained Gold Trip, he also finished runner-up on I\u2019m Thunderstruck in the Cox Plate at Moonee Valley. Riding in Kalgoorlie at the turn of the century, the WA-raised jockey never imagined he would have a chance to ride in the Melbourne Cup. But having established himself a top flight horseman, he was booked to ride Verry Elleegant at the start of the mare\u2019s campaign for the 2021 Melbourne Cup campaign. But the 40-year-old missed Verry Elleegant\u2019s triumph when among the jockeys banned for attending a house party in breach of Covid-19 guidelines which led to a three-month suspension. He watched in a drunken despair from Byron Bay as the champion mare produced a brilliant run. \u201cThis time last year I was in Byron Bay and I was getting told off for drinking too much, [because] it could have been my ride. [It is] redemption day today. It is a miracle,\u201d he said. \u201cTwelve months I felt terrible and I was drinking my way out of it and [my wife Elyse] was saying, \u2018Don\u2019t drink too much\u2019. I said, \u2018What do you want me to do? My horse just won the Melbourne Cup.\u2019 For today to come, and I\u2019ve got good mates in [Gold Trip], it is just unbelievable.\u201d Showing great confidence in the staying capabilities of Gold Trip, Zahra rode a heady race to claim the Melbourne Cup for the first time. But as he returned to scale, he conceded that never had a straight felt as long as the punishing finish at Flemington, as he feared Gold Trip may have hit the front too early. \u201cI got to the front a bit soon but he is a horse that, when you go for it, you have to go. You don\u2019t want to give him time to think about it,\u201d he said. \u201cI can\u2019t put this triumph into words. It is unbelievable.\u201d  Maher praised Gold Trip, which finished an unlucky ninth in the Cox Plate before rebounding strongly at Flemington to record its second win from 16 starts. The triumph makes up for a controversy a year ago when Gold Trip was scratched on the eve of the Cox Plate when stood down by stewards, a decision Maher described as \u201cpretty embarrassing\u201d given the stable believed the horse was fit to compete. \u201cTo run in three of the big ones and then present in the cup like that was fantastic,\u201d he said. \u201cMark was very good on him in the Caulfield Cup. We knew he had that good turn of foot and he was fantastic today. It is unbelievable. It is a dream come true. I am just thrilled.\u201d Maher\u2019s first memory of the Melbourne Cup was when watching the race as a schoolboy at the Mailors Flat Primary School in western Victoria. At that stage, his family was into motorbikes. But he was hooked. He pursued a career as a jumps jockey about the time Zahra moved east to Victoria. The pair became friends. After the triumph, Zahra said he could remember the beer cans lying around Maher\u2019s place after parties in their youth. He suspected the Gold Trip team might celebrate in grander style on Tuesday night.  Eustace was raised in England but has formed a formidable training partnership with Maher since moving to Victoria. \u201cObviously I am a bit overcome,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is a dream to win it. It is a pinnacle for our sport. I am so grateful to be training with him. This horse, who was so unlucky in the Caulfield Cup \u2026 it is quite incredible.\u201d Interpretation, another stablemate of the winner, did not finish, though the Maher and Eustace camp said it appeared the stallion had suffered a wind issue. Three horses were officially listed as finishing distanced \u2013 Numerian at 73 lengths behind the winner, and Camorra and Serpentine 99 lengths adrift. A field of 22 jumped after the late scratchings of Point Nepean with an elevated blood count on Monday and Lunar Flare due to lameness on Tuesday morning. Leading contenders Loft and Durston, the Caulfield Cup winner, were withdrawn prior to acceptances after stewards found soundness issues. Torrential rain that fell on Melbourne earlier on Tuesday cleared for the marquee event, but come the 3pm start time the track was hardly dry. A section near the 1,500m mark has also sustained damage in the early hours of Tuesday morning when protesters poured an unknown fluid onto the surface. The track was cleaned and repaired before being deemed fit to race on. Police say they are investigating the incident."

                    "body": "You might expect a feast of attacking rugby when two of Europe\u2019s great entertainers lock horns but this was a famine \u2013 played out in a flood. Harlequins will not care, for this was a gritty victory, delivered by Andr\u00e9 Esterhuizen\u2019s second-half try and founded on defensive resilience, against a thoroughly disappointing Racing 92 side. Equally, however, it was the sort of evening that makes you long for spring.  Harlequins were helped by a red card to Racing\u2019s No 8 Kitione Kamikamica after 50 minutes but after going down narrowly in Durban last week, this kickstarts their European campaign. Racing meanwhile, have lost their opening two matches and still have to play Leinster away \u2013 for the three-time finalists this is not looking likely to be their year. All be told, it was a rancid match, played out in even worse conditions. He wasn\u2019t having the best of games but that Finn Russell \u2013 whose lucrative move to Bath next season is set to be confirmed this week \u2013 was replaced after an hour summed up that it was not a day for players of his ilk. Empty seats are rarely seen here and though some supporters were evidently more interested in events in Qatar, some no doubt put off by the weather, the fact that there were plenty to be seen only adds currency to the debate that this competition is losing its allure. If organisers had hoped these two might put on a show to bust that theory, they were sorely disappointed. In the positives column for Harlequins was the performance of the 20-year-old Fin Baxter at loosehead on his first start, named man of the match for his showing up against far more heralded opposition while Danny Care\u2019s experience \u2013 as is so often the case \u2013 was significant too. As far as the neutrals are concerned, the hope can only be that things will improve in the reverse fixture in January in Racing\u2019s space-age indoor stadium. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t the prettiest and we did our best to ruin it but we\u2019re back in the hunt again,\u201d said the Harlequins coach Tabai Matson. \u201cIt\u2019s probably one of the most pleasing things when you have to defend, people putting their heads into hard places, and there was no shying away from that.\u201d Just as they did in South Africa last week, Harlequins struck early with the opening try after three minutes through George Head, who showed a turn of pace not usually associated with a hooker to take Care\u2019s flat pass and burst clear. Racing\u2019s defending left little to be desired but Head took his chance wonderfully, Tommy Allan converting for a 7-0 lead. A penalty from Russell got Racing on the board before he missed one he really ought to have scored but Harlequins were equally rueful soon after, unable to take advantage of a series of scrum penalties a few metres out from the visitors\u2019 line. Racing made them pay with their opening try in the final minute of the half, finished by Kamikamica from close range, after they had turned the screw in the Harlequins 22, enough to go in at half-time with a lead they barely deserved. It lasted less than 10 minutes after the restart, however, with Esterhuizen running on to Care\u2019s pass from the base of the scrum and bludgeoning his way over. Allan added the extras and just two minutes later Harlequins found themselves a man up when Kamikamica was sent off for a tip tackle on Nick David. It was unfortunate for Kamikamica in the sense that it was a dominant tackle on the onrushing fullback but given he lost control of David, who landed on his neck and shoulders, he could have no complaints. It seemed to galvanise Racing, to inhibit Harlequins but the visitors grew ever desperate, aware of what a second successive defeat would mean for their hopes of qualification. Harlequins, led by Alex Dombrandt and Will Evans, were at least resolute in defence and held firm for the final half an hour, eking out the type of victory that they are hardly accustomed to but as a result one that will please their coaches all the more."

                    "body": "With Sunday\u2019s Canadian Grand Prix the final fly-away meeting of the spring, Formula One is about to enter its European leg proper. But the sport\u2019s very popularity may now be putting at risk some of those classic races in what used to be considered F1\u2019s heartland. Following the money as ever, F1 is signing more expensive and longer deals with circuits. But given there are a finite number of slots available on the calendar, something has to give.  This past week, the F1 CEO, Stefano Domenicali, travelled to meet the organisers of a proposed South African Grand Prix at the Kyalami circuit. No official word has been made but there is clear expectation that South Africa will be added to the calendar in 2023. It will be a welcome return, with F1 having not held a meeting in Africa since Kyalami hosted its last GP in 1993 and with drivers including Lewis Hamilton expressing a firm belief the sport should have a presence in Africa. On Thursday, F1 said it had signed a new deal for the Australian GP to be hosted at Melbourne until 2035, a 10-year extension on their current contract to 2025. It is the second-longest deal after F1\u2019s recent contract with Bahrain that extends until 2036 and is indicative of the type of business F1 is now concluding. A contract with Saudi Arabia is worth a reported \u00a350m per meeting for more than a decade. Qatar will begin its 10-year deal next season, having paid similar money. At the end of last year, Abu Dhabi renewed its contract until the end of the decade, while Miami\u2019s debut this year was its first in a 10-year deal. The surge in interest in F1 is one the sport\u2019s owners welcome but it comes at a cost. The maximum number of meetings that can be held under the commercial agreement with the teams is 25 and next year is already shaping up to surpass that. With 22 races this season \u2013 and Las Vegas, Qatar, South Africa and a return for China, if Covid regulations allow, all set for next year \u2013 at least one race has to go. Clearly F1 will not be considering dropping those big-money, long-term deals. Monaco, France and now even the Belgian GP at Spa are vulnerable. Race rotation \u2013 a circuit hosting a grand prix every other year \u2013 will be employed. The Belgian GP, which has featured in 66 years of the F1 world championship since it began in 1950, may now have to accept it cannot compete with the sport\u2019s financial demands. There is also concern at the facilities and infrastructure in Spa, as demonstrated last year when the heavy rain that scuppered the race left fans stranded with their cars stuck in muddy fields surrounding the circuit.  Monaco has been bullish it will remain a permanent feature on the calendar but even that race cannot consider its position sacrosanct. Since F1\u2019s owner, Liberty Media, has expanded the sport, particularly in North America, Monaco\u2019s place as a glamour meeting that sells the sport is no longer of great import and discussions with the organisers grind on, a far cry from the preferential treatment the race received under Bernie Ecclestone\u2019s regime. Conversely, it is believed the French GP at Paul Ricard would be open to becoming a biennial event and it is understood that Spa and France are in the running to be dropped next year. That they may become rotational meetings is indicative of the booming sport\u2019s clear ambition. Only a year ago some team principals were expressing the desire to set the season at 20 races, fearing for the toll on their personnel, especially with a relentless run of double- and triple-headers. After Canada, 13 races remain and all are either double- or triple-headers. There has also been disquiet that the sheer volume of races was diluting their impact and value. Senior figures have expressed concern that it is hard to sell a grand prix as special when they come thick and fast.  Last year, McLaren\u2019s CEO, Zak Brown, made the case for a core of 15 races, with a further 10 rotating in and out of the calendar; five one year, five the next, in a 20-race season. His plan seems hopelessly out of step with what F1 is aiming for. While Domenicali has made the case for 23 races being the optimum, the indications from what is being planned for next year are that F1 is heading toward a 24- or 25-race season. Race-hosting fees are one of the three biggest sources of income, along with TV rights and marketing, and with the global economy in a precarious position, locked-in fees are a stable source of income the sport wants to embrace. Many of Europe\u2019s venues may well maintain their place on the calendar but only as part of what will turn into an immense, gruelling season."

                    "body": "The UK economy unexpectedly grew by 0.1% in November as consumers headed to the shops in the run-up to Christmas and pubs and bars enjoyed a boost from the men\u2019s World Cup. Raising the government\u2019s chances of avoiding a long recession, City economists said hard-pressed consumers had proved more resilient than forecast despite the cost of living crisis. However, business groups warned that the economy was likely to suffer over the coming months as higher mortgage rates and the withdrawal of state support for energy bills begin to hit disposable incomes further. A downturn in the manufacturing sector also limited the strength of the economy and meant that over the three months to November the economy contracted by 0.3%, according to the Office for National Statistics. The British Chambers of Commerce said it was significant that the boost to consumer-facing industries, including retail, wholesale and hospitality, had failed to overcome a dramatic loss of sales compared with pre-pandemic levels. \u201cThe figures provide further evidence that UK economic growth is heading in the wrong direction despite this period normally being among the busiest for the retail sector. \u201cWhile month-on-month GDP grew by 0.1%, this is a volatile measure. The three-month average, standing at \u20130.3%, sends a clearer signal of the current trajectory of the economy,\u201d it said. The ONS said that sectors selling directly to consumers had suffered an 8.5% fall in income since February 2020 and that unlike other G7 countries, the whole economy remained smaller than it was three years ago. Cost of living pressures are likely to become more acute this year as tax rises and the withdrawal of government subsidies take effect.  Ministers are poised to increase unit gas and electricity prices for consumers from April, pushing the average bill to \u00a33,000, up from \u00a32,500. Meanwhile, interest rate rises by the Bank of England mean average annual payments for millions of mortgage holders will increase by \u00a33,000. The Bank of England has warned that the UK is probably set for a long recession, as defined by two consecutive quarters of contraction. The economy shrank by 0.3% in the third quarter between July and September, and figures for the October to December period will be published next month, confirming whether or not the economy entered recession at that point. Samuel Tombs, the chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said the verdict \u201changs in the balance\u201d but it was almost certain a recession was coming in the first half of 2023. \u201cLooking ahead, we continue to think that GDP will drop substantially in the first and second quarters of this year.\u201d James Smith, a senior economist at ING, downplayed the prospect of the UK suffering a bigger downturn than other developed nations. \u201cWe\u2019re looking for a peak-to-trough fall in GDP of a little more than 1.5%, which would match closest with the early 1990s recession in terms of scale,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd despite the UK\u2019s many woes, particularly in the jobs market, we aren\u2019t convinced Britain will be a serious outlier from the rest of Europe on the hit to GDP this year, even if it probably does sit in the bottom half of the pack.\u201d Analysts have warned that some of the trends in the data were difficult to judge after a series of events that distorted the usual pattern. November\u2019s 0.1% rise represented a slowdown compared with 0.5% growth in October, when the economy rebounded from a weak September, caused in part by the closure of many businesses for the Queen\u2019s funeral. A Reuters poll of City economists predicted the economy would shrink by 0.2 % in November. Jeremy Hunt said his priority was to bring down inflation to alleviate the cost of living crisis and revive the economy. \u201cWe have a clear plan to halve inflation this year \u2013 an insidious hidden tax which has led to hikes in interest rates and mortgage costs, holding back growth here and around the world,\u201d the chancellor said."

                    "body": "In the minutes before England went out to warm-up for their match against Wales last Saturday, Eddie Jones gave the team a last pep talk. \u201cThis is the day, boys, where you can really put the team forward,\u201d he told them. \u201cAnd old England and new England come together.\u201d Two hours later, they had won 23-19 but Jones, and everyone else, was still waiting for that performance he had spoken about. England are at an awkward stage, caught between the way they used to play and the way they want to, while Jones tries to blend a group of new young players with the survivors from the squad that lost the World Cup final in 2019.  They have been working on it in Bristol this week on a three-day training camp at Clifton college, before their back-to-back matches against Ireland and France, the two best teams in the tournament. England have it in them to beat both but will have to play better than they have done. England cannot afford to keep waiting for that moment when everything clicks. \u201cThat\u2019s definitely the vibe in the camp,\u201d says Harry Randall. \u201cWe feel we\u2019ve been very close, like in that first-half performance against Wales. On another day we could have scored two or three of those chances and then at half-time we\u2019d be up by 20, 25 points. So we feel like we\u2019re very nearly there.\u201d England had more than 60% of the possession in the first half against Wales, just like they did when they lost to Scotland, but did not manage to score a try in either half. So a lot of the work now, Randall says, \u201cis around what we do when we get into their 22 and we\u2019re putting them under pressure, how can we be more clinical in that area.\u201d Jones has been drilling them in this new \u201cfree-formation\u201d attack, which in theory means that after the first couple of attacking phases, everything should be unpredictable and fluid, with the playmakers making spontaneous decisions, and runners swapping in and out of positions. But as Jones has said, that depends on the understanding between the scrum-half, the fly-half, the inside centre and the men around them, who all need to be able anticipate one another\u2019s thinking and organise themselves accordingly in the split-seconds available. So far in this Six Nations, England have not seemed to have the confidence or cohesion to make it work.  Randall believes it is coming. \u201cThe more you play with someone the better connection you have,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m really enjoying playing with Marcus [Smith]. We\u2019re still learning a lot from playing with each other. It\u2019s about building that partnership and connection on and off the field, because that 9-10 axis is very important to controlling the team. \u201cI\u2019ve played four games with him now, we\u2019re slowly getting there game by game. Hopefully, we get the chance to play with each other more but training is probably the best place to keep on working at that connection. We sit down after and go through clips, talking to each other about what we both want. You get out what you put into it.\u201d England fans will not necessarily thank him for it, but for Jones, all this is a bet on being ready by the next World Cup. You can hear him thinking about it in the way he has been talking. He has described these last three matches as a quarter-final, semi-final and final and is encouraging the players to think that way. Time is getting tight there, too, given how much team-building they still have to do. Smith is 23, Randall 24 and they have played 12 Tests between them. After these two games they have the summer tour to Australia and three autumn internationals, one more Six Nations and then into the World Cup warm-up matches. Which explains why Jones has finally decided to move Randall into the starting XV, when the position has belonged to Ben Youngs for the past four years. After 115 caps Jones knows exactly what he will get from Youngs: he is steady, accurate and does not make many bad decisions. Jones trusts him to run the game. But Randall offers the promise of something different, something a little more threatening, a little \u201czip-zip\u201d Jones calls it. He brings a pace to the game and a threat around the breakdown the team have not really had in that position since Danny Care played his last game in the autumn of 2018. \u201cI was delighted,\u201d Randall says when asked how it felt to start against Wales, \u201cbut it doesn\u2019t matter if I start, he starts, or Raffi Quirke comes in. Whoever it is we\u2019ve got to do what\u2019s best for the team.\u201d Which might be true but they, and everyone else, need to grow into the new roles, with Youngs playing finisher, and \u201csquadfather\u201d, to the group, while Randall gets used to setting the tempo in the first hour of the match. Randall says they dovetail well.  \u201cWe work together a lot, do a lot of passing and kicking, always learning off each other. Ben is the most-capped men\u2019s international now so it\u2019s pretty awesome to be learning off him. We\u2019ve got a good relationship, we help each other out, we always talk and connect with each other about things. It\u2019s good to bounce off each other and give each other ideas.\u201d The idea is that one of these days all this study is going to have to pay off and England will spring forward. Jones will hope it is sooner rather than later."

                    "body": "It spoke volumes for the slog England and Italy produced on Saturday that, by the end, what did not happen seemed more telling than the little that did. England did not click in attack and did not create many clear chances; when that briefly changed, Raheem Sterling did not adjust in time to convert a cross from Reece James when gloriously positioned in front of goal. Sterling\u2019s miss jarred particularly in the aftermath, when a frustrated Gareth Southgate put it on the line that his supporting cast need to do more. England are too reliant on Sterling and Harry Kane for goals, he said, which presents an added layer of complication when one or both are misfiring. When the rarity of Kane\u2019s talent was put to him, the theme of absence dominated again. \u201cThe concern is if you don\u2019t have him for whatever reason,\u201d Southgate said.  In the event Kane came to harm, England would presumably soldier on with Tammy Abraham \u2013 although Southgate hardly glowed about the Roma player\u2019s performance at Molineux \u2013 or flirt with a false 9, perhaps Phil Foden. Kane will always provoke the most concern but the prospect of a spluttery Sterling scratched at a sore that has been developing elsewhere in England\u2019s attack. Southgate finds himself lighter on in-form alternatives out wide than he might have expected a year ago. Where England\u2019s attacking options were being feted as the most bountiful in the world, the number from whom he can reliably coax a tune has dwindled. Even though Sterling\u2019s place in the starting XI at the World Cup is virtually assured, notwithstanding some uncertainty over his status at Manchester City, most of those who could line up on the opposite flank, or even dislodge him, come with caveats and compromises. It raised an eyebrow to hear Southgate assert, without explicitly naming names, that Marcus Rashford and Jadon Sancho have \u201cgot a lot to do to get back in the squad\u201d. Only 11 months have passed since both players participated in the Euro 2020 final; Rashford is by some distance the third-highest scorer among England\u2019s probables and possibles while memories should stretch sufficiently to visualise Sancho, not called up since October, dovetailing beautifully with Kane and Sterling during some of the qualifiers for that competition.  Both struggled during an awful Manchester United season; Sancho\u2019s uptick in form towards the end of the campaign may give him greater hope of a recall but it is asking a lot for either to garner the momentum between August and October that may restore their international manager\u2019s confidence.  Of the others who may hold aspirations of dislodging this month\u2019s crop, Emile Smith Rowe cannot be discounted but needs to ally a repeat of his early-season form with a robustness that is not yet evident. Harvey Barnes has not kicked on since his debut in 2020 and Jesse Lingard\u2019s time has almost certainly passed. Callum Hudson-Odoi\u2019s next cap looks more likely to be for Ghana. Mason Greenwood is out of the picture. Suddenly the cupboard does not look as lavishly stocked and it increases the chances that Southgate will ultimately go with the group who have, by his own estimation, lacked sharpness during a slow-burning Nations League mini-series. He needs more from most of them. In recent days he has spoken in pointedly admiring terms of Mason Mount, often unprompted or in response to questions pushing competitors\u2019 claims.  Mount\u2019s versatility and tactical cuteness make him a manager\u2019s dream, even if he is less imposing on the ball than some. Southgate was delighted with his pressing from the No 10 position against Germany, where he felt Mount had nullified Joshua Kimmich, and the Italians; that looks like his eventual home, although he could be deployed in a narrow supporting role in a variant of 3-4-3. Assuming Southgate opts for a back four when England begin their Qatar 2022 campaign against Iran, that would leave a choice between Foden, Bukayo Saka, Jack Grealish and Jarrod Bowen for the other wide spot. The argument for Foden has possibly been improved by his own absence with Covid-19, given the paucity of England\u2019s offering, although there are still questions around where he fits in.   For his blend of defensive diligence, technical quality and attacking dynamism Saka ticks the most boxes: there is a sense he must impose himself more consistently, though, and it is worth noting three of his four international goals have come against Andorra and San Marino. Perhaps it is Bowen and Grealish who, set alongside each other, lay Southgate\u2019s conundrum barest. After Bowen performed respectably on his debut in Hungary, Southgate pointed out he had taken more shots than anyone else in the team. Assessing Grealish\u2019s much-anticipated start against Italy, he praised his ball-carrying qualities but observed they had only brought one goal attempt. Bowen has rough edges but is direct, sharp and, even if chances go astray, willing to come back for more. Could a path be opening up all the way into the starting lineup at Khalifa International Stadium?  \u201cI have had chances and been in positions where I am getting chances,\u201d he said of his nascent international career. \u201cIt\u2019s just about converting those chances and being really ruthless.\u201d If he goes one better against the Hungarians on Tuesday, his claim may become impossible to ignore. Bowen and Grealish spoke last week of the freedom Southgate affords them. Grealish could be seen drifting in front of his back four to take possession during Saturday\u2019s second half. That is yet to translate into fluidity and there are underlying factors beyond the wide men\u2019s varying merits: England would be so much slicker, for example, if their attackers could combine with at least one midfielder capable of taking possession on the half-turn and recycling it as quickly as their continental peers. But that situation will not change before November so the forwards must find a way to step up. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to start to spread that load,\u201d Southgate said of their goalscoring burden. That glut of wing talent must quickly become conspicuous by its end product, rather than its holes."

                    "body": "Good morning.\nDonald Trump has been compelled to testify under oath by a congressional committee investigating the deadly attack on the US Capitol on January 6, which named the ex-president the \u201ccentral cause\u201d.\n\u201cWe have left no doubt \u2013 none \u2013 that Donald Trump led an effort to upend American democracy that directly resulted in the violence of January 6,\u201d said Bennie Thompson, chair of the committee, watched by police officers who defended the Capitol that day.\n\u201cHe tried to take away the voice of the American people in choosing their president and replace the will of the voters with his will to remain in power. He is the one person at the center of the story of what happened on January 6. So we want to hear from him.\u201d\nYesterday\u2019s House of Representatives select committee move may prove a largely symbolic gesture, given legislative time constraints before the midterms and Trump\u2019s probable legal resistance.\nTrump responded on his Truth Social platform but did not say whether he would comply. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t the Unselect Committee ask me to testify months ago?\u201d he wrote. \u201cWhy did they wait until the very end, the final moments of their last meeting? Because the committee is a total \u2018BUST\u2019.\u201d\n\n\u201cCan you believe I lost to this effing guy?\u201d said Trump a week after the 2020 presidential election was called in favor of Joe Biden, according to former White House aide Alyssa Farah. Yet at the same time, he attempted to undermine and change the results.\n\nSenator investigates Qatar link to $1.2bn Kushner property rescue\n\nA leading financial firm faces questions about whether Qatar was secretly involved in the $1.2bn rescue of a Fifth Avenue property owned by Jared Kushner\u2019s family while Kushner was serving in the White House.\nRon Wyden, the Oregon Democrat who leads the Senate finance committee, has given the chief executive of Toronto-based Brookfield Asset Management until 24 October to answer a series of questions about a 2018 deal in which Brookfield paid Kushner Companies for a 99-year lease on the family\u2019s marquee 666 Fifth Avenue property.\nWhen it was announced in August 2018, the rescue reportedly generated enough money for the Kushner family to pay $1.1bn of debt on the building and buy out a partner.\n\u201cI remain deeply concerned that funding from a foreign government was involved in the rescue of a Kushner-owned property while Jared Kushner was employed as a senior White House official closely involved in the formulation of US policy towards the Middle East,\u201d Wyden said.\n\n\u2018Committee stonewalled\u2019. Brookfield may have \u201cintentionally misled\u201d the public when it said that \u201cno Qatar-linked entity\u201d had been involved in the deal, according to Wyden. It has been alleged that Brookfield used a Qatari-backed fund to fund the transaction. A spokesperson for Brookfield did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Kushner could not immediately be reached for comment.\n\nFive people, including police officer, killed in North Carolina shooting\n\nA North Carolina mayor has announced that five people, including a police officer, were killed in a shooting in a residential area yesterday. Raleigh mayor Mary-Ann Baldwin told reporters that several people were shot on the Neuse River greenway trail around 5pm, and that the police department had told her the suspect had been \u201ccontained\u201d at a residence in the area.\nNumerous police vehicles and multiple ambulances had rushed to the Hedingham neighborhood starting in the late afternoon, and officers remained there for hours during an apparent hunt for the shooter. Details of what happened were still scant by early evening.\n\u201cState and local officers are on the ground and working to stop the shooter and keep people safe,\u201d governor Roy Cooper had tweeted shortly before 7pm ET.\n\nSource of the firearm used in shooting still unclear. The state has stronger gun laws than other southern states where people are allowed to buy and carry firearms without a permit. In North Carolina, prospective buyers are required to pass background checks before they buy a handgun.\n\nRussia to evacuate Kherson, which could become frontline\n\nMoscow has announced it will evacuate Kherson after an appeal from the Russian-installed head of the region, raising fears the occupied city at the heart of the south Ukrainian oblast will become a new frontline.\nMarat Khusnullin, a Russian deputy prime minister, told state television that residents would be helped to move away from the region, which remains only partly occupied by invading troops because of a successful Ukrainian counterattack in recent months.\n\u201cThe government took the decision to organise assistance for the departure of residents of the [Kherson] region to other regions of the country,\u201d Khusnullin said.\nIt comes after a public request by Volodymyr Saldo, a former mayor of the port city, who was installed in April by the Russian forces as head of the wider Kherson region, imploring Vladimir Putin to help those who wished to flee the fighting, claiming Ukrainian attacks were imperilling the lives of local people.\n\nSaldo, who was mayor of Kherson city between 2002 and 2012, said: \u201cWe, residents of the Kherson region, certainly know that Russia does not abandon its own, and Russia always lends a shoulder where it is difficult.\u201d\n\nIn other news \u2026\n\n\nDissidents in China detained and harassed as Beijing prepares for party congress. Authorities have stepped up surveillance of government critics as part of a crackdown on dissent before the Communist party\u2019s 20th congress, its key twice-a-decade political gathering.\n\n\n\nDutch crown princess moves out of student flat after security threats. Catharina-Amalia, 18, has moved to the royal palace after threats to her security, amid reported fears that criminal gangs may target her for kidnapping or an attack.\nBankers\u2019 bonuses in the UK have doubled since the 2008 financial crash, according to research by the unions\u2019 umbrella body that accuses the government of enriching City financiers while suppressing the pay of key workers.\nElon Musk is under a federal investigation related to his $44bn takeover of Twitter, the social media company said in a court filing made public yesterday. Twitter, which sued Musk in July to force him to close the deal, said his attorneys had claimed \u201cinvestigative privilege\u201d when refusing to hand over documents.\n\nStat of the day: 70.8bn tonnes of east Antarctic glacier melts a year\n\nResearchers from Australia\u2019s national science agency have said the Denman ice shelf in remote east Antarctica could be at risk of unstable retreat as it melts at a rate of 70.8bn tonnes a year because of an ingress of warm sea water. It was thought east Antarctica would not experience the same rapid ice loss that is occurring in the west but some recent studies have shown warm water is reaching that part of the continent, too.\nMelting of the floating part of the glacier does not add to sea level rise, writes Lisa Cox, but as the ice shelf becomes thinner or weaker it provides less resistance to the flow of ice from Antarctica into the ocean. \u201cOne of the take-home messages is when we\u2019re looking at how much sea level is going to rise into the future, we do need to take east Antarctica into account, as well as west Antarctica,\u201d said Steve Rintoul, one of the paper\u2019s authors.\nDon\u2019t miss this: I broke every bone in my face\n\n\u201cOne evening, the three of us were chilling on the balcony of my apartment, then my brothers went to bed,\u201d Justin Starks tells Daniel Dylan Wray. \u201cFrom then on, I don\u2019t know what happened. I remember waking up in a hospital and being told I had fallen off our 30ft (nine-metre) balcony. I can remember my life about 30 minutes before the fall, but nothing after that. A lot of people say: \u2018Oh my God, that must be the most painful experience imaginable,\u2019 but I don\u2019t remember.\n\u201cWhen I regained consciousness, my main concern was for my twin brother because I wasn\u2019t sure if he knew what had happened to me \u2013 he might have thought I was dead. I didn\u2019t have my phone on me, but the hospital called him. I later found out that he had seen my body on the ground. Someone on the ground floor had heard the impact of my fall and called the paramedics.\u201d\nClimate check: Egypt \u2018silenced\u2019 critical voices before Cop27\n\nEgypt\u2019s independent environmentalists have been neutralised before the country hosts this year\u2019s UN climate talks, the environment director at Human Rights Watch has said. Richard Pearshouse said a failure to address abuses by Egypt and other authoritarian regimes would hold back the introduction of the forward-thinking climate policies needed to move away from dirty energy and rein in the climate crisis, in an interview with Nina Lakhani.\n\u201cIt will be a fundamental mistake if diplomats go to Cop27 thinking they need to go softly-softly on human rights in order to make progress in the climate talks,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will not get the urgent climate action needed without civil society pressure, the situation in Egypt shows us that.\u201d\nLast Thing: the many mysteries of the magic mushroom\n\nThe time of year when not-your-average ramblers can be seen hunting for a natural \u2013 if illegal \u2013 high across the northern hemisphere is upon us once more, writes Ed Douglas. \u201cAs is usually the case at this time of year, in among the ovine poo were some familiar mushrooms: purple russulas, ones to avoid, puffballs, and the spindly stem and Phrygian cap of Psilocybe semilanceata, or the magic mushroom,\u201d he recounts of a hike in Eyam Moor, nestled in middle England.\n\u201cMagic mushrooms do particularly well on sheep pasture, thriving on all that manure and the nitrogen in sheep urine. But is it a two-way street? Some mushrooms are toxic to sheep just as they are to humans. The sheep don\u2019t know this, though, and tiny magic mushrooms must be hard to avoid. Watching the sheep grazing peacefully, I wondered how you would know a sheep was tripping? Do they have visions? Are there shaman sheep?\u201d\nSign up\n\nFirst Thing is delivered to thousands of inboxes every weekday.

                    "body": "One of the toughest aspects of building a new year fitness habit is finding the time. Even in our hybrid-working world, it can feel like carving out just 30 minutes a couple of times a week is an impossible ask. But everyone has five minutes: it\u2019s about a third as long as people spend looking for something to watch on Netflix. And although five minutes might not seem like much, if you keep your efforts focused, you will start to see results \u2013 as well as building the foundations of a longer-term habit. So pick an area to work on and get the egg timer going. Posture Desk jobs tend to build bad posture, and not everything you do in the gym will help \u2013 the typical \u201cbench bro\u201d routine can lead to a forward hunch that will set you up for problems down the line. \u201cPosture is really about back strength,\u201d says Helen O\u2019Leary, a physiotherapist and clinical pilates instructor. \u201cThe more the muscles in the back of your body work, the more they will hold you up against gravity.\u201d Use these three movements in a circuit, doing each once. Prone press\u201cA great mobility and prep exercise to start with at the end of your day,\u201d says O\u2019Leary. \u201cLie on your stomach with your hands by your chest and your nose hovering above the floor. \u201cPress your pubic bone into the floor to create a stable base. Press down into your hands and imagine you are pressing the floor away \u2013 this will start to send your upper back off the floor. Pause with your lowest ribs on the floor, take a breath and then lower back down. As you improve, try lifting your hands at the top of the movement to see if you can hold yourself up.\u201d  Pilates swimming\u201cVery much a progression of the prone press \u2013 this will test your endurance as well as your core control,\u201d says O\u2019Leary. \u201cStart as before, this time reaching your arms and legs away from each other as if you\u2019re being pulled apart in a tug of war. You should end up with both feet and hands off the floor. Pause when you are here, and make sure you are breathing \u2013 then start to \u2018paddle\u2019 the arms and legs from the shoulder and hip socket. Your body will rotate a little and this is totally fine. Ideally, build the length of time you are up towards 60 seconds.\u201d Single leg kick\u201cIt\u2019s great for posture, but this movement also includes strength work around your shoulders, and will mobilise your spine,\u201d says O\u2019Leary. \u201cPlus, your legs get involved, making it an all-in exercise. Lie on your front and press yourself up on to your elbows to make a triangle shape with your forearms, with your hands still slightly apart. Press down into your pubic bone and extend and raise one leg away from you so that it starts to hover off the floor from your lower thigh onwards. Now try to keep that leg off the floor as you start to draw a long arc upwards and outwards with your toes, bending the knee as you do. Again, keep the thigh off the floor and extend the leg out behind you before lowering it to the floor. Repeat five times on each leg, if you can.\u201d Core strength  This is important for everyday life, but tackling it the old-school way \u2013 with hundreds of momentum-heavy sit-ups \u2013 isn\u2019t efficient. Instead, remember that the real purpose of your core muscles is to keep you braced, whether you are carrying the shopping or doing a parallel turn on the ski slopes \u2013 so you need to focus on slow, controlled movements that will help them do their job. Do each of the three exercises below for 40 seconds, rest for 10-20 seconds, and repeat. Crunch\u201cAlthough it\u2019s an old exercise, when performed with correct form, the standard crunch is great, as it activates nearly all the muscles of the core,\u201d says the personal trainer Jacqui Ward. \u201cLie on your back, keeping your knees bent and feet flat on the floor, making sure your lower back is also pressed into the floor. Engage your abdominal muscles to lift your head and shoulders off the floor. I like to increase the time under tension, while at the top part of the crunch, by pausing for a second, and then slowly lowering back to the floor with control, keeping those abs contracted. If you really must put your hands behind your head, don\u2019t pull on your head or neck.\u201d  Bicycle crunch\u201cAgain, technique is everything on this movement,\u201d says Ward. \u201cGet into a regular crunch position, then lift both legs off the ground. Lift your right shoulder toward your left knee and simultaneously extend your right leg, then repeat on the opposite side without pausing. Make sure to move slowly and emphasise muscle contraction to get the most out of the exercise.\u201d This emphasises your obliques more than the standard crunch, so it\u2019s worth doing both.  Side plank raise\u201cA side plank is a great movement, as it will show up any imbalances between your two sides,\u201d says Ward. \u201cTo start, lie on your side with one forearm on the ground, your hand slightly in front of your shoulder. Put your top leg either in front or on top of the \u2018grounded\u2019 leg. As you exhale, push into your hand and feet, and lift your hips up until you are in a diagonal line. Drop your hips down, then press into your hand and feet and lift your hips back up so that they are almost in line with your shoulder. Repeat this movement, slow and controlled rather than bouncing, for 20 seconds on each side \u2013 if it\u2019s tough on your wrist, press your fingers into the floor and create a little dome in your palm.\u201d Mobility  Whether you\u2019re a runner who doesn\u2019t do much else, or an avid gamer who only has time to stretch during the loading screens, a little goes a long way when it comes to mobility exercises. For an all-round hit, try the \u201cslow burpee\u201d, which engages almost every muscle you have. Start standing with your feet just outside shoulder width apart, then squat down, placing your hands between your legs. Walk your hands out into a push-up position, directly under your shoulders. Do one push up, then reverse the movement, stand up, breathe and repeat. Do them ladder-style: one rep, one breath, two reps, two breaths \u2026 up to five or 10.  Strength It\u2019s tough to build real strength doing five minutes a day \u2013 Olympic weightlifters will often rest for up to five minutes between heavy sets \u2013 but if you want to make a start in the time you have, try staying still. \u201cIn that kind of time frame with no equipment, isometrics [the tightening of a specific muscle or group of muscles] aren\u2019t a bad option,\u201d says strength coach Joseph Lightfoot. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to warm up much, and there\u2019s basically no risk of injury.\u201d Pair the movements below a couple of times a week. Press-up holdStarting from a high plank (ie as if you were at the top of a press-up), lower yourself until your elbows are bent to a roughly 90\u2013degree angle, then hold for 30-60 seconds. Keep your elbows tucked to your body and your body plank-straight \u2013 this will also build core strength.  Squat holdsSquat down until your upper thighs are parallel to the floor and hold the position for 30-60 seconds, keeping your torso upright and head high. Too easy? Move on to the single leg squat hold by putting one leg behind you, keeping your trailing knee hovering just above the floor, without putting the foot to the ground. Hip flexibility For anyone who is not particularly active, building flexibility and mobility around the hips is key: it\u2019s the biggest bang for your buck in terms of improving overall quality of life. \u201cJust a few simple hip-openers can improve the external rotation of the femur bone in the hip socket and improve your flexibility,\u201d says Helen Gaunt, an elite runner and personal trainer. \u201cUse these three for 45-60 seconds each \u2013 or on each side \u2013 and try to do them a few times a week.\u201d  Bound angle poseYou may also know this one as the butterfly stretch: it\u2019s great for the inner thigh muscles, or adductors. In a seated position, bring the flats of the feet together, holding them in your hands with your knees out to the sides. Inhale and then exhale, dropping your shoulders as you push your knees downwards towards the ground, keeping your head tall, and back straight. This can also be done against a wall for support \u2013 or leaning forwards, pushing the elbows down on to your thighs. Figure of fourLie on the floor facing upwards, lift both legs and bend them, keeping one foot on the floor and bringing the other ankle across to rest against the opposite knee \u2013 you should feel a slight stretch in that leg. Lace your hands behind the thigh of the non-stretching leg and pull it towards you to increase the stretch, but not so much that it\u2019s uncomfortable. Hold, then repeat on the other side.  Child\u2019s poseFinish with this relaxing hip-opener position. Kneeling with your knees open and your feet together, hinge at the hips, lowering your upper body forwards, bringing your head down towards the floor and reaching your arms forwards to stretch out the upper back. Hold for at least 60 seconds, inhaling and exhaling slowly and deeply, releasing and loosening the hips and pelvis to improve range of movement. Fat loss The four-minute Tabata intervals workout programme beloved of gym classes is slightly overrated: in the studies that showed its effectiveness, professional athletes warmed up for 20 minutes before even starting the protocol, and did their sets at 170% of VO2 max (100% of V02 max is often \u201cassociated with complete exhaustion and/or vomiting\u201d). Still, if time is short and you\u2019re aiming to burn some fat, one move beats all the others: a Louisiana University study that compared kettlebell swings, cleans and deadlifts to a more traditional sprint training programme found that calorie expenditure was biggest with the bells.   To master the kettlebell swing, stand with your feet just outside shoulder-width and the kettlebell hanging from both hands. Bend your knees and hinge your hips slightly, then snap your hips forward, using the momentum to swing the bell upward. Weight-wise, don\u2019t go too light; if you can use your arms to do the reps, you can go heavier."

                    "body": "For the last few weeks Paris has been gripped by stories of superstar players wanting to leave this place. For an hour at the Parc des Princes it was easy to sympathise, as a Paris Saint-Germain team with Neymar and Lionel Messi installed as a walking-football front two produced a horribly constipated performance en route to a 1-0 defeat by Bayern Munich that threatens to deadhead their season before the end of February. The emir of Qatar was in Paris to watch this last-16 first leg, hotfooting it from Rome, and perhaps, who knows, with half an eye on opportunities in the north-west of England. There has been some unease in Paris about the interest in Manchester United. The Elon Musk blather, the Saudi chat may all sound a little far-fetched. But the emir, well, he definitely does like buying stuff. Presumably he will have at least woken up for the final half-hour, where the arrival of Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 injected life and pace into this blue-shirted star vehicle. Otherwise PSG looked like an imitation of a team here, outplayed for long periods by a neat and competent Bayern.  Le Parisien had billed this match as \u201cLe Grand Soir\u201d. And it is basically the season for PSG, a year of the project, ready to do or die once again across 180 minutes of knockout football. The Parc des Princes was a thunderous place at kick-off, although as ever with a sense of being en f\u00eate, of lots of people basically singing and dancing next to a football match. Bayern went with a back three from the start, an ambitious shape that meant Kingsley Coman taking a turn as an attacking left wing-back. For PSG Mbapp\u00e9 was, as promised (by the man himself), on the bench despite a thigh injury. Warren Za\u00efre-Emery, a 16-year-old from the banlieues, started in midfield for the biggest game of the year. It says a great deal for this club that it was Za\u00efre-Emery \u2013 their best player to that point \u2013 who would eventually make way for Mbapp\u00e9, rather then the mummified entity still going by the name of Neymar. And from the start PSG just looked utterly flat, a collection of random parts trying in vain to assume the shapes of a team. For a while Bayern dominated, not just taking the ball and keeping it, but looking so much more coherent as an entity. Jo\u00e3o Cancelo fizzed a cross through the six-yard box. Towards half-time Joshua Kimmich had a shot that whipped past the post.  As for Paris, well, they had Messi. And even here when he dropped deep and ran with the ball \u2013 PSG\u2019s only noticeable attacking tactic \u2013 you still felt that thrill of recognition, the energy field of this unmistakable presence, the great mobile brain. Otherwise it was cautious stuff. Bayern tried to create patterns, to press in packs and find overloads out wide. Paris defended in two blocks and waited for their superstar front two to create an illusion of motion. It took Bayern eight minutes of the second half to score the game\u2019s only goal. Alphonso Davies had replaced Cancelo at half-time, and he made it, whistling in a hard, flat, outswinging cross from a strangely untended left touchline, left vacant as Danilo rumbled back on after an injury. Coman finished expertly on the volley, before engaging in a rather faux-humble non-celebration in front of his former supporters. The angle, the first-time finish, the colours brought to mind his winner in the Covid summer Champions League final of 2020.  As did the abrupt appearance of Mbapp\u00e9, who might have won that game, but was here now to save this one \u2013 and was desperately needed given PSG\u2019s entropy to that point. Bayern should have added another. Jamal Musiala began to fizz and twirl in tight spaces. Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting saw a close-range shot well saved by Gianluigi Donnarumma. At the other end Mbapp\u00e9 provided a first glimpse of that thrillingly effortless speed, veering in on goal, feet barely grazing the turf and drawing a fine close-range save from Yann Sommer, the ball bouncing back off his face. PSG were better in those final 20 minutes, given life by some angry driving runs from Mbapp\u00e9. He had the ball in the net but was offside, narrowly. Messi saw a shot deflected just over the bar. At the death Benjamin Pavard was sent off for a second yellow card. But really this was thin gruel for a team of such riches, which just seems to have too many room-temperature parts, too little in the way of internal structure, and a forward plan still based around wheeling its star parts into place and hoping for ignition. Even without the away goals rule Bayern\u2019s 1-0 lead looks formidable. For PSG, halfway out of elite competition for another year, there is a sense of dissonance, of key parts ageing and starting to come undone. A great deal hangs on the second leg in Munich."

Play had been stopped because fans were receiving medical treatment after disturbances in the stands, at which point a Goztepe supporter ran on to the pitch, picked up the corner flag and used it to attack the Altay goalkeeper, Ozan Evrim Ozenc, before being restrained by nearby players and security staff.\n\nGoztepe and Altay are longstanding rivals from the city of Izmir, with the derby a notoriously fiery fixture. The game had already been stopped in the 19th minute after fireworks were thrown at the home fans from the away section.\nElsewhere on Sunday, the Russian Cup tie between Zenit St Petersburg and Spartak Moscow descended into chaos when six red cards were issued after a mass brawl in stoppage time. With the scores goalless and penalties looming, a clash between Quincy Promes and W\u00edlmar Barrios prompted the referee to sprint across and forcibly separate the pair, before players and staff rushed over and a huge fracas broke out with punches and kicks being aimed from both sides.\nThree players from each team were sent off, including two who had already been replaced and and one unused substitute. Zenit went on to win the penalty shootout 4-2."

                    "body": "On 18 October, the BBC marks the 100th birthday of its foundation (one month before it started regular radio broadcasting). It will be hoping the celebrations make the case for its continuation, amid discussions with the government over the broadcaster\u2019s form and funding after the current agreement runs out in 2027. Given political pressure for the BBC to become more commercial, there\u2019s an irony that it was exactly that a century ago. The British Broadcasting Corporation, state-owned under royal charter, has only existed since 1 January 1927. From 18 October 1922 until then, it was the British Broadcasting Company \u2013 a consortium of wireless receiver manufacturers. My selection of shows from each of the BBC\u2019s 100 years aims to recognise the \u201cbest\u201d (subjective as that inevitably is) but sometimes the worst. These are part of the BBC\u2019s history, too \u2013 and sometimes threatened to end it. Some ground rules: I have picked only programmes made by the BBC, which excludes imports (Dallas, Neighbours, Das Boot) no matter how significant. And because, say, Sir David Attenborough could represent at least five years, each creative (unless part of a comedy team) features only once.  Many early BBC records are missing, so some shows have been reconstructed from Radio Times back copies, newspaper listings and reviews, and memoirs or biographies. Another important source is the Official History of Broadcasting in the United Kingdom by Asa Briggs.  1922 \u2013 Preliminary Broadcast  \u201cHello, hello. This is 2LO, the London station of the British Broadcasting Company calling! 2LO calling.\u201d The experimental network 2LO had broadcast one hour a day since 11 May. From 14 November, it was transferred to the British Broadcasting Company. This call-sign formally started BBC broadcasting, and the first voice heard was that of Arthur Burrows. He read a one-minute weather and news bulletin, then repeated it at dictation speed so listeners (estimated at 10,000) could take notes \u2013 education was a key aim of the BBC from the beginning. For this, the first licence fees cost 10 shillings, equivalent to about \u00a319 today. 1923 \u2013 Organ Recital at the Steinway Hall Broadcast at 3pm, this was the first \u201cwireless\u201d programme listed in the launch edition of Radio Times on 30 September. It kicked off five and a half continuous hours of organ music, which likely reflected the kind of material deemed appropriate for a Sunday \u2013 then sacred as the Christian day of rest.  1924 \u2013 Woman\u2019s Corner For most of its 100 years, the BBC has been accused of being too London-centric. But at the start, short and weak radio signals required 20 transmission centres around the UK, all with different schedules. Those in range of Birmingham got Woman\u2019s Corner at 4.45pm. This mother-programme to one of radio\u2019s biggest franchises featured a daily talk: subjects included topical horticultural hints and Shakespeare\u2019s heroines. 1925 \u2013 The Travelling Man Until at least the 1990s, the vast majority of broadcast dramatists were male, but one of the earliest radio playwrights was Lady Gregory, though she was more likely chosen for her aristocratic heritage than proto-feminism. The opening lines of this one-act play \u2013 \u201cWhat is it you are going to make, mother?\u201d / \u201cI am going to make a grand cake with white flour. Seeds I will put in it\u201d \u2013 spookily foresaw the future significance of baking to the BBC. 1926 \u2013 Big Ben, Weather Forecast and General News  A sequence still familiar to listeners \u2013 time signal (the chimes of Big Ben), climate news, headlines \u2013 became part of the rhythm of radio. But a news bulletin on 4 May triggered the first of many times that a government threatened the BBC over its journalism. A miners\u2019 strike led to an industrial walkout. As this included print workers, the government filled the newspaper gap with its own propaganda sheet, the British Gazette, edited by the then chancellor of the exchequer, Winston Churchill. Infuriated that news bulletins early in the dispute neutrally reported the views of government, unions and employers, Churchill sought to use emergency powers to take over the British Broadcasting Company (as it still was) as an official Downing Street mouthpiece. John Reith, the BBC\u2019s general manager, resisted this, but was forced by the government to deny a voice to opposition politicians. This tension \u2013 a broadcaster owned by the state but seeking editorial independence from it \u2013 has continued for 96 years. 1927 \u2013 The FA Cup Final  This was the first ever live commentary for an event that remains in the BBC schedules in 2022. Cardiff beat Arsenal 1-0. Curiously, the commentator, George F Allison, later became the Arsenal manager. A picture of the Wembley pitch, divided into eight squares, was printed in Radio Times; during the transmission, Allison\u2019s assistant, Derek McCullouch, shouted out which quadrant of each half the ball was in. On 1 January, after five years as a private company, the BBC became a state-owned network, its final initial now standing for \u201ccorporation\u201d. Reith became the first director general and received a knighthood. 1928 \u2013 Wish Wynne The first variety (the precursor to light entertainment) slots drew on music hall entertainers, including Wish Wynne, a comedienne \u2013 as listings billed her \u2013 with a speciality of \u201cfairytales in cockney character parts\u201d. Wynne became so devoted to radio that, insisting the show must go on despite frail health, she collapsed at the end of a Sunday broadcast in 1931 and died soon after. 1929 \u2013 The Second News Now broadcasting from 10.30am until midnight, the BBC\u2019s wireless service expanded to two daily news bulletins: the first in the early evening, the second later at night, a pattern that continues to this day. Even big news \u2013 such as the Wall Street crash in November \u2013 would wait until those slots, so scheduled shows such as More Biscuit Recipes and Elementary French could always go out as planned.  1930 \u2013 The Man With the Flower in His Mouth  The first drama broadcast in both picture and sound was an adaptation of this short play by Italian dramatist Luigi Pirandello. Co-produced with TV pioneer John Logie Baird\u2019s own company, the show had few actual viewers (hardly any sets existed) but showcased the BBC\u2019s bi-media future. In another major restructuring, from 9 March, the wireless output was divided into regional and national programming. The Man With the Flower in His Mouth was reserved for regional London audiences. 1931 \u2013 The Mary Celeste: A Mystery of the Sea This was the origin story of one of TV\u2019s superpower genres: the true-crime drama. L Du Garde Peach, a prolific writer of historical sketches for Children\u2019s Hour, recreated the mystery of the American merchant ship found floating in 1872 with its entire crew missing. \u2022 Coming up tomorrow in part two (1931-41): the king falls, peace fails."

                    "body": "At the end, after Marcus Rashford scored goals 14 and 15 of a superb season so far, all was well for Manchester United, who had made this Carabao Cup quarter-final far more attritional than they might due to Erik ten Hag shuffling his team selection. Having an eye on Saturday\u2019s 189th derby with Manchester City meant the manager sent out a weakened XI and he watched his side burn brightly in the first half before being pushed back by Charlton, who arrived as the hopefuls from two tiers below and ended threatening to take United to penalties.  This was until Rashford\u2019s intervention: his first goal came from the service of Facundo Pellistri, a replacement making his debut, the No 10 dinking the ball over the Charlton keeper Ashley Maynard-Brewer. His second derived from a Casemiro pass, which set Rashford up for a curled finish. United could, finally, relax deep into stoppage time, after Charlton had pressed for an equaliser, Scott Fraser bouncing a free-kick at Tom Heaton. United\u2019s stand-in keeper was excellent all evening, and gratefully gathered. This was a sixth consecutive game Rashford has scored in, and an eighth at home. \u201cWhen he brings himself into position for one-on-ones in the box he will score and that is what he is doing at the moment,\u201d said Ten Hag. \u201cWhen he keeps the focus and keeps putting the same effort in he will keep on scoring.\u201d United\u2019s hopes of ending a six-year trophy drought remain alive and they have now enjoyed victory in 11 of their last 12 matches. Ten Hag offered a verdict on what was his 300th career win. \u201cThe performance in the first half-hour was good, especially with some young guys on the pitch \u2013 especially [Alejandro] Garnacho: he was a threat so many times,\u201d the Dutchman said. The 18-year-old began with a burst along the left and set-up Diogo Dalot who should not have blasted over. This was followed by him again slicing through Charlton\u2019s defence and unloading but Maynard-Brewer\u2019s goal was not threatened. United swarmed all over their visitors, Fred hitting a pile-driver that hit Ryan Inniss\u2019s head and knocked the defender over, so better for Charlton was Corey Blackett-Taylor\u2019s cross that Harry Maguire turned out for a corner: when delivered by Albie Morgan it was bravely dealt with by Heaton, whose punch out came back via George Dobson\u2019s attempt and the goalkeeper saved low down. From here, United broke, the relentless Garnacho carrying the ball 60 yards, but after Scott McTominay, Anthony Elanga, Kobbie Mainoo and Tyrell Malacia all joined in the attack it fizzled out.  Ten Hag had stood down to the bench Rashford, Casemiro, Christian Eriksen, David de Gea and Luke Shaw and handed the 17-year-old Mainoo a debut, the Stockport lad operating in advanced midfield before the 9,000 Addicks enthusiasts who made the trip from London for their biggest game since the triumphant 2019 League One playoff final. What they next saw was Maguire, making a rare start, initiating the sequence that closed with Antony\u2019s opener. The captain\u2019s sweeping diagonal was taken by Malacia, who found Fred, and when he tapped to his fellow Brazilian, a curving 20-yard shot beat Maynard-Brewer. Charlton were showing why they are a mid-table League One side, second-best in pace, invention, attack and execution as they were pinned back, hopeful of a breakaway. But it was all United: on 33 minutes Aaron Wan-Bissaka was introduced for the injured Dalot \u2013 \u201ca precaution\u201d, Ten Hag said \u2013 then Fred crashed a free-kick off Maynard-Brewer\u2019s left post, before, at the other end, Morgan, from a similar 25-yard free-kick position, missed to Heaton\u2019s right. As the interval arrived United\u2019s possession nudged above 70% and their shot count was nine so their slender advantage was a poor return, particularly as Heaton had to save from Fraser in added time. After the break came further Charlton resurgence via a golden chance to equalise when Lisandro Mart\u00ednez and Malacia missed second balls and Fraser blazed high. At this point the ruthlessness Ten Hag has demanded previously was absent and this was further emphasised when Elanga scored from an offside position: better concentration would have allowed United\u2019s centre-forward to hold his ground and legally finish Wan-Bissaka\u2019s neat volleyed pass. United needed either to steady the contest or score again because those in white were no longer being cuffed aside. Ten Hag plumped for the former by bringing on Casemiro for Mainoo, Rashford for Antony, and Eriksen for Fred. By sending for the cavalry he hoped to finally put Charlton away. After a Maguire dribble \u2013 he was dispossessed \u2013 next followed Eriksen claiming a corner: the Dane hit this in and after Rashford shot, Mart\u00ednez\u2019s strike was ruled offside. Now, came Rashford\u2019s late late show."

If Iran can go forward and put together a run even half as compelling as the Welsh run to the semis of Euro 2016 I\u2019ll be ecstatic. Smaller teams live for the hope, and Wales showed that sometimes that hope can be rewarded.\u201d Now that\u2019s how to win graciously.     12.19pm    \u201cWatching the first half I turned to my mate and said \u2018this has Scotland written all over it\u2019,\u201d says Kerr Wells. \u201cHeroic, disappointing, \u2018what might have been\u2019 elimination.

Updated at 12.44pm GMT    12.17pm    The BBC are showing a montage of Iran putting it about. There were a few bits of naughtiness \u2013 standing on Kieffer Moore\u2019s toe at a corner, things like that \u2013 and it\u2019s probably fair to assume that a European referee would have given one or two more yellow cards. But it was hardly England 1972 (Berlin branch) or Brazil 1974, and it doesn\u2019t change the essential truth: the best team won.  Updated at 12.46pm GMT    12.16pm    There is a not inconceivable way that Wales can qualify (I think)  England beat the USA The USA draw with Iran Wales beat England B   Updated at 12.47pm GMT    12.14pm    Wayne Hennessey\u2019s red card      12.13pm   The Iran coach Carlos Queiroz speaks   It\u2019s just the beginning, we need to finish the job. It was a wonderful day for us \u2013 we [stuck] to football, and I don\u2019t have words to say thank you to the players. They were brilliant, they deserve all the respect. People will now understand that these boys love to play football. [What\u2019s your message to the Iranian people?] The players, they deserve to be supported. We did it for them, we did it for them. That\u2019s the only reason we\u2019re here, to play for the fans.  I assume he\u2019s referring to the fact that the players chose to sing the national anthem before the game. For any team, never mind one whose country is experiencing civil unrest, they played with phenomenal intensity.   Updated at 12.22pm GMT    12.12pm    \u201cCan\u2019t begrudge them,\u201d says Matt Dony. \u201cThe better team won. There\u2019ll always be a \u2018what if\u2019 around Moore\u2019s volley in the first half, but it wasn\u2019t to be. It\u2019s still Wales at the World Chuffing Cup, which is more than I dreamt of for most of my life.\u201d     12.10pm   Gareth Bale's verdict   It\u2019s gutting [boings his lips]. We\u2019re gutted, there\u2019s no other way to say it. It\u2019s difficult to take but we have to recover and try and go again. It\u2019s gonna be difficult [to qualify] for sure, it depends on the other game. I haven\u2019t seen the red card so I don\u2019t know [if it was a fair decision], but it changes the game completely.   Updated at 12.11pm GMT    12.08pm    What it all means Wales aren\u2019t out, but they need snookers now. Iran will almost certainly go through if they beat the USA and may well do so with a draw, though that depends on what happens between England and the USA tonight.     12.05pm    Let\u2019s be clear: Iran were deserved winners. They were the stronger team even before Wayne Hennessey was sent off, and kept playing with purpose and belief even when it looked like time was up. They scored in the 98th and 101st minutes, shattering the Wales players in the process.      12.03pm   Full time: Wales 0-2 Iran  I don\u2019t know what to say.     12.03pm    Wales threw everyone forward and paid the price. It was a four-on-two break, finished delightfully by the relentless, indefatigable right-back Ramin Rezaeian. Ansarifard put him through with a square pass on the edge of the area; he drew Ward and lifted the ball slowly, teasingly, joyously over him. In the circumstances, that is some finish.  Updated at 12.11pm GMT    12.01pm   GOAL! Wales 0-2 Iran (Rezaeian 90+11)  It\u2019s all over now!   Updated at 12.09pm GMT    12.00pm    Devastation for Wales, and sheer, frenzied joy for Iran. A low cross from the left wasn\u2019t dealt with properly by Joe Allen \u2013 the kind of absent-minded clearance you\u2019d expect from somebody who has been on all game in that heat, but not necessarily from a substitute \u2013 and ran to Cheshmi, 25 yards from goal. He half-controlled it on the stretch, ran after the loose ball and whistled a brilliant curling shot towards goal. It brushed the fingertips of the diving Ward, who saw it late and was at full stretch, and nestled in the bottom-right corner. My word.  Updated at 12.42pm GMT    11.59am   GOAL! Wales 0-1 Iran (Cheshmi 90+8)  What a goal from Rouzbeh Cheshmi!    Updated at 12.05pm GMT    11.58am    90+7 min All the players who started the game look completely spent, physically and emotionally.      11.56am    90+6 min Neco Williams\u2019 mishit shot almost falls for Johnson at one end; then Rezaeian\u2019s shot is blocked by Davies at the other.     11.55am    90+6 min Jahanbakhsh is booked a high challenge on Mepham; it\u2019s his second yellow so he\u2019ll miss the USA game. It also allows Wales to waste another 30 seconds.     11.54am    90+5 min Rezaeian is booked for dissent.     11.54am    90+4 min Now James is fouled just inside the Iran half. These dead seconds are precious for Wales. Davies eventually drives the free-kick into the area and Hosseini \u2013 the replacement goalkeeper who has been terrific \u2013 claims decisively.   Updated at 11.58am GMT    11.53am    90+3 min And if you want to know more about the man Wayne Hennessey inadvertently homaged with that assault on Taremi, Gary Naylor is your friend.      11.52am    90+2 min The resulting free-kick is eventually fed in towards Moore, in a bit of space in the area, but his first touch is a weary one that runs through to Hosseini. There was a sniff of a chance there.     11.51am    90+2 min Moore, who must be utterly shattered, does superbly to hold the ball up, draw a foul and buy Wales a bit of time.     11.51am    90+1 min There will be nine added minutes. Wales are on the ropes, the brink, the edge; the lot.     11.50am    90 min As my colleague Daniel Harris rather brilliantly puts it: Hell, bloody football.     11.49am    89 min: So close from Torabi! This is unreal. Ansarifard has a shot blocked, then Torabi smashes a rising drive from the edge of the area that goes this far wide of the right-hand post.     11.48am    88 min: Wales substitution The sub goalkeeper Danny Ward replaces Aaron Ramsey.     11.47am   HENNESSEY IS SENT OFF!  86 min It looks worse every time you see it. He could have been sent off twice: once for the denial of a clear goalscoring opportunity and once for poleaxing Taremi with what was essentially a knee to the face. He launched into a scissor kick, thinking he was going to get to the bouncing ball a split-second before Taremi. He was wrong. \u201cShades of Schumacher\u201d says the BBC commentator Steve Wilson. Unlike Harald Schumacher in 1982, Hennessey was going for the ball \u2013 but he didn\u2019t get it and he flattened Taremi with a combination of knee, hip and arm. Even Andre the Giant would have gone down from that.    Updated at 12.30pm GMT    11.45am   VAR CHECK  Hennessey will be sent off here.     11.45am    84 min: It\u2019s all kicking off! Taremi just beats Hennessey to a long ball forward, 40 yards from goal, and is totally wiped out. The referee gives a yellow card, which can only be because he thought Neco Williams would have got to the loose ball before Taremi. Personally I think it\u2019s a clear goalscoring opportunity. More importantly so do the entire Iran team, who are raging at the referee.  Updated at 12.29pm GMT    11.44am    83 min: Good save from Hosseini! Williams\u2019 long-range shot is unwittingly blocked by Moore, but he is alert enough to lay the loose ball off to Davies on the edge of the area. He crashes a rising drive that is pushed over by the leaping Hosseini. A good save, though one he\u2019d expect to make.     11.43am    83 min: Iran substitution And now they have none, unless the game goes to extra time: Ezatolahi is replaced by Ali Karimi.     11.42am    82 min Ezatolahi is down with cramp. Iran have one substitution remaining.      11.41am    80 min Gareth Bale has done nothing. Nada. Zilch. The square root of bugger all. If I was an Iran supporter, the \u2018it\u2019s too darned quiet\u2019 principle would be haunting me.  Updated at 11.41am GMT    11.39am    79 min \u201cIt says something about how stressed the Wales fans at the stadium must be,\u201d begins K\u00e1ri Tulinius, \u201cthat they loudly applauded winning a throw-in near the half-way line. Enjoy the last twenty minutes!\u201d     11.38am    78 min: Wales substitition Joe Allen, who has been out since mid-September, comes on for Ethan Ampadu.   Updated at 11.42am GMT    11.38am    78 min: Triple substitution for Iran After a lot of faffing, Ali Jahanbakhsh, Mehdi Torabi and Rouzbeh Cheshmi replace Gholidazeh, Hajisafi and Nourollahi.     11.35am    75 min For most of the game Iran have played on the break, but at the moment they are all over Wales like a cheap cliche. If Gareth Bale is going to write another script, now would be a decent time.     11.34am    74 min \u201cA draw is ok,\u201d pleads Matt Mony. \u201cIf this finishes even, and assuming England beat the USA, then England are guaranteed to go through as group winners. Meaning they could play a weaker team in the last game, with a Gijon-esque lack of intensity. Is it how I dreamed Wales would go through? No. Would I take it? Absolutely!\u201d      11.34am    73 min: Fine save by Hennessey! Wales are right on the edge here. Ezatolahi shifts the ball away from a Wales player in the D and sweeps a low, right-footed drive towards the far corner. Hennessey, who must have seen it late, gets down to his right and fingertips it round the post. That\u2019s an extremely good stop.  Updated at 11.35am GMT    11.32am    72 min Gholizadeh\u2019s cross is shinned behind by Rodon. The corner is taken short and eventually comes to Pouraliganji, whose shot is blocked.     11.32am    71 min Ezatolahi\u2019s angled cross beyond the far post is headed down by Pouraliganji, still up from a corner, and Hennessey is quick off his line to claim. Wales look tired now.     11.31am    70 min Sheesh, this is tense. If it stays like this the winners will be the USA, though it\u2019s pretty complicated. A draw isn\u2019t the end of the world, or the World Cup.   Updated at 11.40am GMT    11.30am    69 min Reorder these letters: SFF.      11.29am    68 min: Iran substitution Karim Ansarifard replaces Sardar Azmoun, who has run himself into the ground.     11.28am    67 min Johnson slows down in the area, then zips past Mohammadi and drives a low cross towards the near post. Bale misses an attempted flick behind his standing leg and Iran clear. That was good from Johnson, exactly the kind of no-nonsense running Wales want from him and James.     11.27am    66 min Iran have been heavy-footed at times in this hame, and Pouraliganji leaves a bit on Moore after a free-kick has been given.     11.26am    65 min The resulting corner hits the unsighted Johnson and runs to safety. Iran appeal unsuccessfully for handball. It did hit his hand, but it was pretty close to his body. VAR isn\u2019t interested.     11.25am    64 min Another very dangerous break from Taremi. He runs 40 yards, with Mepham backpedalling the whole way, then shifts the ball inside for a shot that is crucially blocked by the covering Ampadu.      11.24am    64 min \u201cI\u2019m hoping one or both of them will prove me wrong and score worldies to win the game for Wales,\u201d begins Michael Gibson. \u201cBut on the evidence of this and the match against USA, both Bale and Ramsey look past it. Ramsey in particular is a shadow of the player he once was, I\u2019ve lost count of the number of times he\u2019s given the ball away. Bale saunters around the pitch like he\u2019s on an extended lap of honour. So come on lads, prove me wrong!\u201d     11.23am    63 min Taremi leads another break and slides an angled through pass towards the unmarked Rezaeian on the right side of the area. James stretches to poke the ball behind for a corner, an important bit of defending.   Updated at 11.34am GMT    11.22am    62 min Make sure you click for the full picture.      11.21am    62 min A dangerous cross from Williams evades everyone in the middle.     11.21am    61 min As the old proverb says, it\u2019s better to be lucky than to be 1-0 down in a musn\u2019t-lose World Cup game.      11.20am    61 min Iran have a substitute ready but Azmoun wants to continue. He\u2019s put in a helluva shift today.     11.20am    60 min Azmoun is down again. I think his game might be over.   Updated at 11.33am GMT    11.19am    59 min This is the revised Wales formation, 4-2-3-1. Hennessey; N Williams, Mepham, Rodon, Davies; Ramsey, Ampadu; Johnson, Bale, James; Moore.     11.18am    57 min Mohammadi fouls Wilson, which gives Rob Page the chance to make a double substitution.  Brennan Johnson and Dan James replace Harry Wilson and Connor Roberts, which means a) pace, b) pace and c) a switch to 4-2-3-1.      11.16am    56 min Now Hajisafi has a shot blocked, I think by Mepham. Wales are hanging on.     11.15am    55 min Ramsey is fouled 35 yards from goal, right of centre. Wilson\u2019s free-kick is poor, straight into the arms of Hosseini.     11.13am    53 min At the other end, Moore beats Hosseini to Bale\u2019s cross and heads onto the roof of the net. The referee might have given a foul against Moore, I\u2019 not sure; either way, it was a half chance at best.  Updated at 11.14am GMT    11.13am    51 min: Iran hit the post twice in 10 seconds! Scenes galore! First Azmoun rumbled into the area from Nourollahi\u2019s angled through pass, held off Rodon and slapped a shot against the right-hand post. Gholizadeh kept the ball alive and shaped an extravagant long-range curler that beat the flying Hennessey and thumped off the left-hand post. It rebounded to Azmoun, who was off balance and could only head straight at a very grateful Hennessey.   Updated at 11.17am GMT    11.11am    50 min Plenty of Wales possession at the start of the second half, though it\u2019s largely in front of the Iran defence. Moore does make a run in behind, down the right, but he\u2019s flagged offside.      11.10am    49 min \u201cI\u2019m sat at my desk, with the game on an iPad beneath my work screens, just a few yards from my boss,\u201d writes Matt, erm let\u2019s change his name just in case, Bony. \u201cI would dearly love to be able to say I was on the beers, but I just don\u2019t think I could get away with it. Should have thought of an Irish coffee, though. And some strong chewing gum.\u201d     11.09am    48 min Another dodgy square pass, this time from Ramsey, puts Wales in trouble. It\u2019s stolen and fed towards Azmoun, who is well tackled by Mepham in the area.   Updated at 11.14am GMT    11.08am    47 min \u201cMorning Mr Smyth,\u201d writes Bill Hargreaves. \u201cAfter the eagle-eyed reader spotted that Tite is, in fact, the \u2018Genial\u2019 Harry Grout (Porridge), I was wondering if Rob Page might have a hint of Bernard '\u2018Orrible\u2019 Ives about him? \u201cSouthgate is, need it be said, Barraclough, making the scheming Harry Kane, Fletch; Gareth Bale being his Lenny Godber. While we\u2019re casting, is Didier Deschamps Mr. MacKay? I have John Stones down as Luke Warm. \u201cSincerely, Blanco Webb.\u201d     11.05am    46 min Peep peep! Iran begin the second half, with no changes on either side. Yet.     11.04am    More half-time reading Germany v Spain, Sunday, 8pm GMT      10.56am    Half-time reading      10.56am    \u201cHello from Swansea!\u201d says Rob Morgan. \u201cI can confirm that a number of us are indeed on the beers, a lot of pubs have kindly opened early for the match. \u201cAlso with regards to the playlist, and in honour of my hometown/team, I think we\u2019d need some SWANS on there?\u201d Well, if you insist.      10.53am    The BBC team are all saying this is a must-win game. That\u2019s not quite the case. It\u2019s a bit complicated, but if this is a draw and England beat the USA tonight \u2013 if, if, if \u2013 both Wales and Iran will still have their destiny in their own hands. (Edit: no they won\u2019t, I\u2019m a moron, but Iran would know that a win over the US would put them through unless Wales beat England.)  Updated at 11.15am GMT    10.51am   Half time: Wales 0-0 Iran  \u201cIt\u2019s hot, and Wales have been a little bit bothered by Iran,\u201d says the BBC commentator Steve Wilson. Wales have had most of the ball but Iran have been the more dangerous team on the counter-attack. Ali Gholizadeh and Sardar Azmoun combined for a fantastic goal that was ruled out for offside; at the other end, Kieffer Moore\u2019s flying volley was beaten away by Hossein Hosseini.   Updated at 11.01am GMT    10.50am    45+4 min The resulting free-kick ricochets dangerously around the area before being cleared. Then Nourollahi hits a long-range shot that is well held by Hennessey. It was straight at him but bounced awkwardly just in front.     10.48am    45+3 min Rodon is booked for an absurd sliding foul on Taremi.  Updated at 10.48am GMT    10.48am    45+2 min Iran work the ball patiently on the right, until Ezatolahi suddenly whips a fantastic cross towards the six-yard line. Azmoun and Rodon both lunge for the ball, but it evades them both and bounces to safety. Azmoun was goalside, and for a split-second it looked like he was going to score.     10.45am    45 min There will be four added minutes.   Updated at 10.46am GMT    10.44am    43 min The BBC picture disappears for a few seconds. Happily for them, Bale doesn\u2019t pick that moment to roof one from 40 yards.     10.42am    43 min The corner is claimed with authority by Hossein Hosseini.     10.42am    42 min Good play from Wales. Davies guides a good ball into Moore on the edge of the area, and he touches it off first time (or miscontrols it, I\u2019m not entirely sure) towards the onrushing Wilson. He hits a first-time shot that is blocked by Pouraliganji and spins over the bar for the first corner of the match.  Updated at 10.43am GMT    10.41am    40 min Free-kick to Iran, 40 yards out. Hajisafi overhits it slightly and it goes behind for a goalkick. Both teams look like they are ready for a breather.     10.39am    39 min Bale galumphs down the left and drives a low cross that is kicked away by Majid Hosseini.     10.38am    38 min \u201cI\u2019m an American who lives in Cardiff with my Welsh husband,\u201d writes Gwyneth Galvin. \u201cI\u2019m visiting my Ohioan family for the holidays, but I set my alarm for 5am so I could catch the match. I\u2019m currently under the covers, suffering a food hangover only made worse by the anxiety of this game. Go on Wales!\u201d     10.37am    37 min Wilson finds Williams in space on the left side of the area, but his first touch is heavy and Rezaeian makes a good tackle. That was half a chance for Wales.     10.35am    35 min Rodon is living on the edge against Azmoun. He makes another desperate last-ditch tackle to stop Azmoun running onto a long ball forward. Rodin has been left one v one quite a lot, which is slightly surprising given that Wales have three central defenders and he is theoretically the spare man.   Updated at 10.43am GMT    10.35am    35 min \u201cHi Rob,\u201d says Anshuman Pande. \u201cYou linked an excellent Gorky\u2019s song at the start of the MBM today. Over the years, lots of your Guardian colleagues on MBM duties have also linked some absolute beauts. Might I suggest a yearly playlist of some of the best MBM music? I\u2019m sure it will beat EA\u2019s playlist by miles.\u201d That\u2019s a good idea. When the group stages are over, and assuming I don\u2019t forget, I\u2019ll try to set one up.  Updated at 10.35am GMT    10.34am    34 min A bit of a quiet spell. If they didn\u2019t know before \u2013 and to be fair, I\u2019m sure they did \u2013 Wales realise now that they are well and truly in a game.     10.33am    33 min \u201cHello from the stadium,\u201d says Pierre Martins. \u201cThere is a dude with the world\u2019s most annoying vuvuzela sat next to me. Var ruling the goal offside made him sad.\u201d I wouldn\u2019t like to run into the world\u2019s least annoying vuvuzela, never mind the most annoying.   Updated at 10.35am GMT    10.31am    31 min Here\u2019s more on the slightly unexpected sight of the Iran players singing their national anthem before the game.      10.30am    31 min You could never leave Gareth Bale out \u2013 imagine the state of Twitter \u2013 but part of me wonders whether, particularly in this heat, you might get more bang for your Bale by bringing him on for the last half hour. Anyway, it\u2019s irrelevant.     10.30am    30 min Bale, hitherto anonymous, mishits a long-range volley through to Hosseini.     10.28am    28 min Azmoun is okay to continue, at least for now.     10.27am    27 min This is a concern for Iran: Azmoun is receiving treatment for the calf problem that has kept him out for the last couple of months. He\u2019s been a serious handful for Wales.  Updated at 10.28am GMT    10.27am    26 min Iran break at pace again. Azmoun tries to run the last man Rodon, who times his lunging challenge perfectly. Gholizadeh shoves Williams over, then chooses to berate him for some reason.     10.26am         10.25am    24 min Williams is limping heavily after being wiped out by Rezaeian. It wasn\u2019t a particularly malicious foul, and it was Rezaeian who alerted the referee so that he could stop play.     10.24am    24 min Here\u2019s that early chance for Kieffer Moore. I\u2019ll post the disallowed goal, which really was a gem, as soon as it appears on the BBC Twitter feed. Talking of which, treat yourself to the Joy of Six: Goals That Never Were. Not now.      10.23am    23 min Rezaeian\u2019s free-kick is headed wide by Azmoun, leaping above Rodon at the far post. He couldn\u2019t get over the ball.     10.22am    22 min Ampadu trips the raiding Rezaeian 35 yards from goal. Iran have been terrific so far.     10.21am    20 min \u201cPhew!\u201d says Matt Dony. \u201cI flipping love VAR.\u201d A quick for Wales fans \u2013 are you on the beer? I can still remember folk in suits hurrying through pre-work pints at 7am on a Friday, as if it was their national duty, when England played Brazil in the 2002 quarter-final.   Updated at 10.23am GMT    10.20am    20 min Another very dangerous Iran break ends when Nourollahi\u2019s shot is blocked by Rodon. Iran are the better team at the moment, no question about that.     10.18am    18 min Bale goes down holding his face after wearing a straight arm from Mohammadi. It was a foul but no more.  Updated at 10.18am GMT    10.17am   NO GOAL! Wales 0-0 Iran  As disallowed goals go, it was a beauty. Roberts\u2019 dodgy square pass was nicked by Gholizadeh, who played a dizzying, progressively orgiastic exchange of first-time passes with Azmoun \u2013 one, two, three, four \u2013 before walking the ball into the net. But when the last pass was played, Gholizadeth was slightly \u2013 and needlessly \u2013 offside. Azmoun could have taken the shot himself as well.   Updated at 11.03am GMT    10.16am    This will be ruled out for offside     10.15am   GOAL! Wales 0-1 Iran (Gholizadeh 16)  VAR permitting, this is a wonderful goal from Iran!   Updated at 10.19am GMT    10.13am    13 min Moore stays down for a bit, but after receiving treatment he is back on his feet.     10.13am    12 min: Good save by Hosseini! Davies sprays a crossfield pass out to Roberts, who pulls it down and shapes a lovely cross towards the near post. Moore stretches to stab an instinctive volley from six yards that is parried away by Hossein Hosseini. Had Moore\u2019s volley gone either side of the keeper he would probably have scored. To exacerbate his pain, Majid Hosseini accidentally kicks him in the face in his follow through.   Updated at 10.17am GMT    10.09am    9 min Iran\u2019s front two, Taremi and Azmoun, are looking really dangerous. An attempted give-and-go is thwarted by a sliding Wales defender on the edge of the area.     10.08am    8 min \u201cChecking in from a wonderful but grey damp Copenhagen where I shall be sporting my Welsh bucket hat in the Danish Design Museum while checking in to MBM,\u201d says Kim Thonger. \u201cMay fortune favour the Bale.\u201d If that\u2019s not an excuse to post a video of Preben Elkjaer, then I don\u2019t know what it is.      10.07am    7 min Azmoun drags a daisy-cutter through to Hennessey from about 20 yards. Iran look bright in attack.     10.06am    6 min A wicked cross from the right-back Rezaeian is headed away desperately by the backpedalling Rodon. That was very good defending.   Updated at 10.12am GMT    10.05am    5 min A long ball towards Azmoun is well defended by Mephan, who stoops to head back to Hennessey.     10.04am         10.03am    3 min Wilson plays a simple ball back to Neco Williams, who cuts inside and whistles a decent long-range shot over the bar. Hosseini wasn\u2019t troubled but it\u2019s a positive start for Wales.   Updated at 10.10am GMT    10.01am         10.00am    1 min Peep peep! Wales kick off from left to right as we watch. They are in red; Iran are wearing white.     10.00am    It\u2019s time for the football. A draw isn\u2019t the end of the World Cup for either team, but both really need a win.     9.57am   Iran players sing national anthem  Both teams line up for the anthems. For once \u2013 and this really doesn\u2019t happen very often - Hen Wlad Fy Nhadau is overshadowed by the Iran anthem. Most of the Iran players choose to sing this time, having remained silent before the England game. I think one or two players were silent this time, too, though I couldn\u2019t be sure. (In fact I suspect I\u2019ve got that wrong \u2013 I\u2019d imagine their approach was unanimous. Maybe a couple were mumbling.) There were certainly whistles, boos and tears in the crowd.   Updated at 10.04am GMT    9.54am    Here come the players. It looks ferociously hot out there.     9.53am    A reminder of the teams Wales (possible 5-3-1-1) Hennessey; Roberts, Mepham, Rodon, Davies, N Williams; Ramsey, Ampadu, Wilson; Bale; Moore.Substitutes: Ward, Davies, Gunter, Allen, Johnson, Morrell, Lockyer, J Williams, Harris, James, Thomas, Levitt, Cabango, Colwill, Smith. Iran (possible 4-4-2) H Hosseini; Rezaeian, Pouraliganji, M Hosseini, Mohammadi; Gholizadeh, Ezatolahi, Nourollahi, Hajisafi; Azmoun, Taremi.Substitutes: Niazmand, Abedzadeh, Moharrami, Khalilzadeh, Kanaanizadegan, Cheshmi, Jalali, Amiri, Ghoddos, Torabi, Karimi, Ansarifard, Jahanbakhsh. Referee Mario Alberto Escobar Toca (Guatemala)     9.53am    It\u2019s another big day for Gareth Bale. Assuming he isn\u2019t sent off before the game for wearing a OneLove onesie, he\u2019ll win his 110th cap \u2013 a record for the Welsh men\u2019s team.     9.50am     The best bit is the way Bale drawls the \u2018effing\u2019, as if he\u2019s trying to sneak it in before the watershed without anyone noticing. (NB: the below clip contains the old C-word.)      9.47am    \u201cThe Guardian fixtures page,\u201d begins Alec Gregory, \u201cshows just what Scotland thinks of this \u2018World\u2019 Cup.\u201d      9.45am    Mood music      9.44am    \u2018If we\u2019re handing out insults for being fat, let\u2019s have a go at him. Look at him!\u2019      9.44am    \u201cI am still absorbing the news that Wales beat Hungary in 1958!\u201d says Ian Copestake. \u201cI mean, it was that Hungary! From 1958!\u201d It wasn\u2019t quite That Hungary: Puskas and Kocsis were among those who did one after the Hungarian Revolution of 1956, although Hidegkuti was still playing.      9.40am    The Iran anthem will be watched almost as keenly as the football. It\u2019s a complex, evolving situation, with a lot to take in, but these two pieces are a good place to start.       9.29am    A bit more pre-match reading      9.24am    It\u2019s a sweltering afternoon in Al-Rayyan. As Gabby Logan has just said on the BBC coverage, bucket hats will come in very handy.      9.22am    \u201cMae gen i barch enfawr at Iran, a\u2019u safiad gyda\u2019r anthem,\u201d says Matt Dony. \u201cOnd, dewch ymlaen, Gymru! Joe Allen is so important to Wales. He might not have the star quality of Ramsey or Bale, but he does things that no one else in the squad can do. If he gets a good run out today, and can maybe start against England, then that\u2019s as positive as I could hope to be.  \u201cI really like Dan James, but Kieffer Moore changed the game when he came on against the USA. He\u2019s a decent striker, who seems to have an uncanny ability to raise his game when he plays internationally. Definitely the right call to start him today. Am I rambling? Who knows anymore. I feel sick. I\u2019m staring at spreadsheets, and 10:00 feels like a long way away. It\u2019s Wales, at the World Chuffing Cup!\u201d     9.20am    In other news, Rob Page and Carlos Queiroz have swapped jobs for the day     9.10am    Essential pre-match reading      9.04am   The teams in full  Wales (possible 5-3-1-1) Hennessey; Roberts, Mepham, Rodon, Davies, N Williams; Ramsey, Ampadu, Wilson; Bale; Moore.Substitutes: Ward, Davies, Gunter, Allen, Johnson, Morrell, Lockyer, J Williams, Harris, James, Thomas, Levitt, Cabango, Colwill, Smith. Iran (possible 4-4-2) H Hosseini; Rezaeian, Pouraliganji, M Hosseini, Mohammadi; Gholizadeh, Ezatolahi, Nourollahi, Hajisafi; Azmoun, Taremi.Substitutes: Niazmand, Abedzadeh, Moharrami, Khalilzadeh, Kanaanizadegan, Cheshmi, Jalali, Amiri, Ghoddos, Torabi, Karimi, Ansarifard, Jahanbakhsh. Referee Mario Alberto Escobar Toca (Guatemala)  Updated at 9.06am GMT    8.58am   Iran team news: Azmoun returns  Carlos Queiroz has changed five of the team that lost 6-2 to England on Monday. The goalkeeper Alireza Beiranvand, who suffered concussion in that match and was briefly allowed to carry on despite not knowing his name, date of birth, nationality or even the last three digits on the back of the card, is replaced in goal by Hossein Hosseini. The other changes? Ramin Rezaeian, Ali Gholizadeh, Saeid Ezatolahi and Sardar Azmoun replace Alireza Jahanbakhsh, Ali Karimi, Roozbeh Cheshmi and Milad Moharrami. That should mean a change of system, from 5-4-1 to what the traditionalists call a four-man back four. Azmoun, who has 41 goals in 66 games for his country, joins Mehdi Taremi (32 in 62) in attack. Iran (possible 4-4-2) H Hosseini; Rezaeian, Pouraliganji, M Hosseini, Mohammadi; Gholizadeh, Ezatolahi, Nourollahi, Hajisafi; Azmoun, Taremi.  Updated at 9.11am GMT    8.46am   Wales team news: Moore starts, Allen on the bench  Rob Page makes one very obvious change from the side that started against the USA on Monday: Kieffer Moore replaces Dan James up front.  Joe Allen, who hasn\u2019t played since mid-September because of a hamstring injury, is on the bench.      8.13am         8.00am   Preamble  Who fancies another ride of the emotional rollercoaster? I\u2019m afraid, if you\u2019re Welsh or Iranian, you don\u2019t have much choice. For different reasons, and in different ways, both countries ran the gamut on Monday. It\u2019ll be no different today. Let\u2019s start with the football. Iran realistically need at least a draw to have any chance of reaching the last 16; Wales could theoretically lose today and still go through. But even in the unpredictable game of snakes and ladders that is the World Cup group stage, that\u2019s not to be encouraged. Their target is simple \u2013 a first World Cup win since Terry Medwin\u2019s goal beat Hungary in a playoff on 17 June 1958, ideally with yet another who-writes-Gareth-Bale\u2019s-scripts moment. Qualification may come down to goal difference, but it would be hubristic to think of that at this stage. Iran are a better side than their 6-2 defeat to England suggested. But they also have other things on their mind. Even in this most political of World Cups, Iran\u2019s situation stands out. I won\u2019t editorialise here, and not only because I\u2019m subconsciously terrified of inadvertently saying the wrong thing and being cancelled before a ball has been kicked. It\u2019s a nuanced situation that is difficult to fully understand if you haven\u2019t been following it intently from the start. The players chose not to sing the national anthem before the England game on Monday, their latest gesture in support of those protesting against the shocking death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini in police custody in September. There are fears of reprisals when the tournament is over, but also some confusion as to whether the local celebrations of that defeat on Monday were directed against the state, the team (for \u2018insulting\u2019 the anthem) or both.  We\u2019ll come back to all that when the players line up for the anthems. I have to dash off and write some failed zingers for our rebranded daily football email, Football Daily \u2013 please su\u2019scribe! \u2013 but I\u2019ll be back with team news around an hour before kick off.  Kick off 10am GMT, 1pm at the Ahmad bin Ali Stadium.  "

                    "body": "\u201cCar parts,\u201d says Sara Eklund, shaking her head. \u201cThey had no idea what they were, so they took a wild guess.\u201d Eklund had hurdles importing the first menstrual cups into Ethiopia, but she hadn\u2019t anticipated having to explain to confused customs officials what the small, pink silicone cups were used for. She had finally got a green light to bring an initial 200 Noble Cups into the country, only to have them confiscated by the Ethiopian Revenue and Customs Authority (Erca) \u2013 over apparent paperwork issues. But Eklund was not deterred. \u201cI thought: go big or go home.\u201d So she went for 5,000 in her second shipment.  There was a new hitch. Erca categorised the product as a luxury item, and imposed a 69% tax. \u201cIt was madness,\u201d says Eklund. \u201cThe system is made to infuriate and frustrate.\u201d With some determination from Eklund, Noble Cup is now on sale in more than 30 shops across the capital, Addis Ababa, with plans to expand. At 230 birr (\u00a33.50), the cups are prohibitively expensive for most women and girls in Ethiopia, where only 28% of women report having \u201ceverything they need\u201d to manage their periods, and 25% do not use any form of sanitary product, relying instead on whatever they can find: rags, newspaper, even cloths filled with ash. Eklund hopes that promoting the product will help encourage a more open discussion, and reduce the stigma and shame around menstrual health. \u201cThis is something every single woman goes through every month,\u201d she says. But shame is deeply embedded, says Mekdim Hailu, campaigner at WaterAid Ethiopia. \u201cPharmacists still hand sanitary pads to customers in newspaper and a plastic bag. Even as young women in an urban area, my friends and I still use code words for periods.\u201d  Hailu welcomes cups as an eco-friendly alternative but says even those who could afford to buy them \u2013 and have access to clean water \u2013 may avoid them for cultural reasons. \u201cWe want girls and women to have many choices, but it\u2019s a foreign concept to put an external product inside your vagina \u2013 even tampons are not used here \u2013 so there is a lot to be done in terms of awareness of this [product].\u201d Born in Virginia to an Ethiopian mother and American father, Eklund went to high school in Ethiopia but returned to the US for college. She was inspired to start her business after her own discovery of menstrual cups, a \u201ceureka moment\u201d in her freshman year. She considered launching a charity to provide cups for free, but her mother, a businesswoman, knocked that idea down. \u201cShe told me, \u2018If it\u2019s going to be anything, it has to be a business \u2013 this concept that Africans just need free stuff is wrong.\u2019\u201d  \u201cShe was right,\u201d says Eklund. \u201cI don\u2019t think donating the cups would have had the same power. When women choose to buy a product, they are more invested in it. They will share stories about it. That\u2019s when behavioural change comes.\u201d Eklund\u2019s team runs basic biology workshops in schools, introducing children to period products. They are also active on social media. \u201cIt\u2019s no coincidence that the rise of the menstrual movement has coincided with the growth of social media,\u201d says Eklund. She cites a woman from Hawassa who contacted the team after watching a TikTok video. \u201cWe sent her some, and she\u2019s become a sort of unofficial ambassador for us,\u201d says Eklund.

                    "body": "Round about a year and a half ago, Mois\u00e9s Caicedo was playing for Independiente del Valle in his native Ecuador, making a name for himself as a skilful and physical all-round midfielder. As such, he was offered to Manchester United, who\u2019ve been in desperate need of that since God was a lad, and Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r was keen, only for those above him to deem the deal too complicated, demanding, as it did, the payment of money. So Caicedo went to Brighton, whose negotiators somehow navigated the torturous path of handing over the asking price, and has been excellent ever since. He stood out in his new side\u2019s 4-0 thrashing of United last season and also in their opening-day win over them, such that United now want to sign him in what would be yet another triumph for football\u2019s most-fabled recruitment department. However, Arsenal, West Ham, Juventus, Atl\u00e9tico Madrid and Bayer Leverkusen are also monitoring the situation. Nor is he United\u2019s only target \u2013 they are also feigning interest in Espanyol\u2019s Ra\u00fal de Tom\u00e1s. Expect them to be enthusiastic right until they discover the price is determined, not by the buyer but by the seller. Meanwhile, the astute decision to first buy Cristiano Ronaldo, then retain him against his will, continues to bear fruit. Ronaldo, it is said, is knocking about Carrington with all his usual grace and humility, so United have offered him to both Milan clubs. Amazingly, neither are keen to disturb their playing system or dressing-room equilibrium for a past-it prima donna, so he remains at Old Trafford \u2013 at least until his contract is cancelled, at which point the number of clubs keen on him, currently zero, is expected to increase. But all the discussion of United\u2019s behaviour should not distract us from that of Barcelona. They\u2019d like to rid themselves of Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang \u2013 some might say they have no choice but to, given their general indebtedness and the wages they owe Frenkie de Jong \u2013 but have rejected a \u00a312m bid from Chelsea. In the meantime, Xavi is acting with all the sensible frugality of a man who spent six years playing and managing in Qatar, mithering Joan Laporta to resign \u2013 sorry, to re-sign\u00ad \u2013 Lionel Messi from Paris Saint-Germain.  But all the discussion of Barcelona\u2019s behaviour should not distract us from that of Chelsea, blazing money despite exchanging an owner who is one of the richest men in the world for an owner wanting to cosplay director of football. As well as offering for Aubameyang, Todd Boehly is also interested in signing Anthony Gordon from Everton, while Everton would like to relieve Chelsea of Armando Broja \u2013 who they are reluctant to lose. All in a day\u2019s work for an expert of Todd\u2019s standing. But all the discussion of Barcelona and Chelsea\u2019s behaviour should not distract us from that of Nottingham Forest, who are busy swapping the squad that got them promoted for a squad of expensive randoms \u2013 such activity having such a strong history of success. The latest player on whom they\u2019re keen is Houssem Aouar of Lyon, who it appears, actually exists \u2013 like Leandro Dami\u00e3o and Nico Gait\u00e1n before him, there were strong rumours that he was a figment of the now-sentient transfer window\u2019s imagination \u2013 but it now looks that, at long tedious last, he is heading for Premier League."

                    "body": "An overambitious schedule, a heavy cold and mental fatigue finally caught up with Magnus Carlsen at the Oslo Esports Cup this week. The world champion had won the previous two legs of the online Meltwater Champions Tour and was expected to make it three in his home city, but it was Poland\u2019s Jan-Krzysztof Duda who edged ahead in Thursday\u2019s final round. Leading scores were Duda (Poland) 14/21, Le Quang Liem (Vietnam) 13, Carlsen (Norway) and Rameshbabu Praggnanandhaa (India) 12, Shak Mamedyarov (Azerbaijan) 11.  A novel format was that the eight grandmasters were all present in the same studio and sat at the table as in an over-the board tournament; but instead of a chessboard between them there were computer screens. Coincidentally or not, the incidence of unintended mouse slips and clicks seems to have been higher than normal. Carlsen has rarely performed at his best in Oslo, which was the scene of one of his most devastating defeats when he lost 2.5-13.5 to Wesley So of the US in the 2019 Random Chess final. This time he was still in contention on Thursday despite two previous mini-match losses but played limply against Mamedyarov and the world No 7 won 2.5-0.5. Afterwards Carlsen apologised for his performance: \u201cIt\u2019s not nearly good enough \u2026 I have no energy in my body whatsoever.\u201d The No 1\u2019s setbacks began early on and reflected his busy schedule. In the afternoon before his round two match he led the Norway team in a solidarity match against Ukraine where viewers could donate to war relief. Carlsen beat his old rival Vasyl Ivanchuk but lost to Yuriy Kozubov and Kirill Shevchenko as Ukraine won 11-5. He then arrived, late and with a heavy cold, for his Esports Cup match and lost 1.5-2.5 to Le Quang Liem. Carlsen recovered and trounced Praggnanandhaa, who had beaten him earlier this year, by 3-0. The 31-year-old then looked set for a comfortable tournament victory until disaster struck against Jorden van Foreest, the winner of Wijk 2021 and a member of Carlsen\u2019s world championship backroom team.   The position at move 20 is complex, but Carlsen had a winning tactic available in 20 Bxa6! Bxa1 21 Nxb7!. Instead he chose 20 Ra2??, only to be shocked by the simple capture 20\u2026Bxa2. This is an example of how long-distance diagonal queen and bishop moves are among the hardest to visualise, which applies even more if a backward capture is involved. Van Foreest drew their other three games to win the mini-match 2.5-1.5, but Carlsen caught up next day with an easy win against the Canadian streamer Eric Hansen. Their third game began with a Grunfeld (1 d4 Nf6 2 c4 g6 3 Nc3 d5) where Carlsen\u2019s 7 Qa4+ is rare. The queen later went to c2 and f2 to join an attack on the king which became decisive when Black missed the defence 25...exf4 26 Bxf4 f5! The drawing of lots to decide the pairings for the Fide Candidates, to be played in Madrid in June, was made in Abu Dhabi on Thursday. Starting numbers are: 1 Duda, 2 TBC, 3 Fabiano Caruana (US), 4 Teimour Radjabov (Azerbaijan), 5 Alireza Firouzja (France), 6 Hikaru Nakamura (US), 7 Ian Nepomniachtchi (Fide/Russia), 8 Richard Rapport (Hungary). Place two remains subject to Sergey Karjakin\u2019s appeal against suspension. If that appeal fails, the place will go to Ding Liren (China). One pairing already stands out \u2013 Caruana and Firouzja, the two pre-tournament favourites, will meet in the 14th and final round. The American Cup, a knockout event between eight top US players, ended on Thursday night at St Louis with victory for the world No 4 and 2018 title challenger, Caruana, who successively defeated Jeffery Xiong, Samuel Sevian, Leinier Dom\u00ednguez and Levon Aronian to take the $50,000 first prize. Several of Caruana\u2019s games lasted more than 50 moves as the 29-year-old took the opportunity to hone his play before the Candidates. The American Cup for Women, with a $25,000 first prize, included a contestant with a potentially significant future. Alice Lee, who lost to the US No 1 woman, Irina Krush, in Thursday\u2019s final, is only 12 years old and has made a rapid advance in the past year, gaining over 300 rating points and qualifying for the WIM and FM tites.  Lee has won four gold medals in world youth championships, has a Fide rating of 2348 which ranks her as No 1 under-16 girl in the world, and scored her first international master norm at open level in February at Fort Worth, Texas. This last result, achieved at 12 years four months, may be the second youngest IM norm ever by a female, behind only the legendary Judit Polgar, who did it at 11. The Beth Harmon of the 2020s? Time will tell. England\u2019s Zoe Veselow (girls under nine), Kushal Jakhria (under seven) and Bodhana Sivanandan (girls under seven) all won gold medals at the European Schools Championships, which finished in Rhodes on Friday. The trio will now compete this weekend in the World Cadets Rapid (Saturday-Sunday) and Blitz (Monday-Tuesday) Championships. Games can be followed live at chess24.com. 3813: 1 Rd6! and if Qxf7 2 Rxh6 mate, or Rxe5 2 Qxc4 wins."

                    "body": "We will probably have to wait until he has left the job to hear exactly what Eddie Jones thinks about how club and country co-exist in England but he gave a clue shortly before he was appointed. \u201cHow can you manage your players when they are controlled by other organisations?\u201d the Australian asked in late 2015. \u201cIn my opinion, that\u2019s the single greatest task ahead of whoever is going to be appointed as the next England coach.\u201d It is a task Jones initially met with belligerence \u2013 as demonstrated with his \u201cDonald Trump of rugby\u201d jibe at the Bath owner Bruce Craig \u2013 but one that he has learned to grin and bear, and while the Rugby Football Union rarely behaves like Jones is kept on any sort of leash, it seems obvious he is now under strict instruction when it comes to criticising that particular arrangement. It is up for renewal soon enough, after all.  Having said that, the subtext this week of Jones declaring Ireland, where the union enjoys far more autonomy over its players, the most cohesive side in the world was clear. But perhaps his comment that the playing field is levelled at the World Cup is more instructive. Because, at times, Jones gives the impression of someone impatiently counting the days until early next summer and the first day of the 2023 World Cup campaign. There was a telling line, buried deep within an RFU announcement last year that the Premiership would be allowed to halt relegation, which said that, in return, the union would have more preparation time in the build-up to the World Cup. Indeed, it is understood the RFU has discussed urging the Premiership to host its 2022-23 final as early as mid-May, and if Jones was not leading those negotiations then rest assured he will have approved. The rub, however, is that Jones has already proven to his employers what he is capable of when allowed to spend time knocking his players into shape. Yes, the 2019 World Cup budget was overspent by nearly \u00a31m, and in the current climate you cannot see that happening again, but he has a body of evidence to demonstrate he can achieve the cohesion he so covets next summer, and for that reason it is hard to see him being sacked even if England lose on Saturday and in Paris next Saturday. You sense Jones knows it, too. The mind goes back to the bowels of Twickenham after one of England\u2019s 2019 warm-up fixtures in which Jones waxed lyrical over the physique of Billy Vunipola, conducting a TV interview on the other side of the room. Go back over the highlights reel of England\u2019s quarter-final win over Australia and Jonny May \u2013 who scored two tries that day \u2013 looks more like a turbo-charged flanker such is the bulk he had put on. Above all else, with uninterrupted access to his players, Jones was able to get Manu Tuilagi in peak shape for the rigours of an arduous campaign. If conditioning was key for Jones, off the field he achieved cohesion too. Jones discusses the booze-fuelled flare-up between Mike Brown and Ben Te\u2019o at a camp in Treviso in his book and pointedly says that was far from the only conflict within the squad. It is believed there was one particular incident when a player\u2019s comedy routine went down so badly he and a teammate had to be pulled apart, and it has been suggested that at one point the rifts were so deep they seemed irreparable. By the latter stages of the tournament, however, players were lining up to explain how it was the most harmonious environment they had been involved in. At first it came across as empty rhetoric but increasingly it seemed genuine.  All of which brings us to Twickenham on Saturday, when the majority of the 82,000 supporters in attendance could not care less about England\u2019s pre-World Cup camps next year. They do not want to hear that the current side is a work in progress, that they are on a journey towards France 2023 and that they are heading in the right direction. They do not want to hear that their side are not favourites or that progress is not always linear, and they cannot countenance England being out of the Six Nations title race before the final weekend again. Rather, they simply want to see England perform as the richest union in the world should and to hell with tomorrow. Twickenham is, after all, expensive \u2013 it is understood that next season more than two-thirds of tickets are set to cost more than \u00a3100 \u2013 so supporters expect value for money. But it was telling this week to hear Jones say the difference for England is that they are not immune from criticism even when they win; you almost wonder if that has encouraged his World Cup preoccupation. That is, of course, not to say that Jones is unmoved about Saturday\u2019s outcome and obviously a resounding victory, founded on power and poise, will boost England\u2019s chances both in this Six Nations and at the World Cup. Jones always publicly insists that he is only bothered about the next game \u2013 to the extent that the phrase has lost all meaning \u2013 and though he will relish adding the final touches next summer, the cohesion he strives for on the field needs to develop over the next 12 months. The average paying punter, though, cares little beyond the next 80 minutes.  It should be acknowledged that the groans that greeted performances in late 2020 and early 2021 have largely dissipated. Granted, England have come from a low base \u2013 when the ball was described by George Ford as a \u201cticking timebomb\u201d \u2013 but there was a swagger, as well as a good slice of fortune, to last autumn\u2019s win over South Africa and there are some encouraging signs around this team, even if there is a fogginess to it all as well. Jones has complete conviction it will clear by next year and though he has lost two finals, his World Cup record stands scrutiny with the best. Defeat on Saturday, however, and the clouds above Twickenham will darken. Jones, just as 12 months ago, will have another storm to ride."

                    "body": "Flightline delivered the performance that fans on both sides of the Atlantic were hoping to see in the Breeders\u2019 Cup Classic at Keeneland on Saturday, powering eight-and-a-quarter lengths clear of his field in the home stretch after cruising through the first mile behind a white-hot pace. We will never know for sure if Flightline is as good as Secretariat, the legendary Triple Crown winner in 1973, but the four-year-old now has a very strong claim to be the best American racehorse since.\nLife Is Good, who took the Dirt Mile at last year\u2019s Breeders\u2019 Cup, scorched through the opening half-mile in 45 seconds in an attempt to burn off Flightline, who had won his five starts before Saturday\u2019s race by an average margin of 12\u00bd lengths.\n\nIt was a futile exercise, and Life Is Good paid the price late on as he faded into fifth place in the stretch while Flavien Prat and Flightline streaked clear. Prat barely moved in Flightline\u2019s saddle as he extended his margin to a record for the Classic, confirming John Sadler\u2019s four-year-old, already the top-rated dirt horse of the last 20 years, as an all-time great.\n\u201cHe\u2019s been brilliant,\u201d Sadler said, \u201cbrilliant is his normal. He didn\u2019t disappoint. He never has.\n\u201cThis is a rare horse, it happens every 20 or 30 years. One of the best American racehorses we\u2019ve seen in a long, long time, and I\u2019m talking back to Secretariat, Seattle Slew. You go through the list.\n\u201cI\u2019ve tried to be a good steward with him, be fair with him. And if you\u2019re good with your horses, they\u2019re good with you.\u201d\nAn injury shortly after Flightline arrived at Sadler\u2019s yard delayed his racecourse debut until April 2021 and cost him the chance of testing himself against the best of his generation in America\u2019s Triple Crown races. But he has scaled the heights in just six races since, and the question now is whether he will continue his brief career into a third season on the track.\n\nFlightline\u2019s brilliance was the abiding memory of the 39th Breeders\u2019 Cup, but it was also an outstanding meeting for runners trained in Europe, as the visitors took six of the seven races on turf.\nThere were three more victories on Saturday\u2019s card after a hat-trick on Future Champions Friday, as Rebel\u2019s Romance and Modern Games completed a double for Charlie Appleby in the Turf and Mile respectively and Tuesday, the Oaks winner at Epsom in June, stormed down the home straight to win the Filly &amp; Mare Turf for Aidan O\u2019Brien.\nAppleby and O\u2019Brien finished the weekend with three winners apiece, and Appleby\u2019s success with Rebel\u2019s Romance \u2013 a first winner at the Breeders\u2019 Cup for James Doyle \u2013 means that he has now won six of the last eight races at the meeting in which he has saddled a runner. O\u2019Brien, meanwhile, left Keeneland with three winners at a single Breeders\u2019 Cup for the first time, and Ryan Moore, his No 1 rider, won the Bill Shoemaker Award for the top jockey at the meeting.\nMoore delivered Tuesday with an irresistible charge down the home straight, beating the front-running In Italian by a length.\n\u201cShe had a beautiful trip,\u201d Moore said. \u201cThe pace was strong and I was in a good spot. I was able to go where I needed to go.\n\n\u201cShe won the Oaks and I thought she would win Group One\u2019s all year, and for whatever reason, things worked against her. She was beaten by [subsequent Arc winner] Alpinista, which was a huge run in hindsight. But today she showed up and put in a really good and professional performance.\u201d\nWilliam Buick also left his challenge until the closing stages on Modern Games, running down Shirl\u2019s Speight well inside the final furlong as Kinross and Frankie Dettori also finished strongly into third from a difficult draw in stall 13.\n\nIt was a second win at the meeting for Appleby\u2019s colt, following his success in the Juvenile Turf at Del Mar 12 months ago.\n\u201cHe\u2019s the ultimate professional, he does what it says on the tin, basically,\u201d Appleby said. \u201cHe\u2019s a typical [son of] Dubawi, he won\u2019t lie down. He\u2019s not the biggest but he seems to grow an extra inch when he\u2019s over here.\u201d"

                    "body": "For years, racing has wondered what it will do without Frankie Dettori, who took over from Lester Piggott as the sport\u2019s greatest headline-grabber and has now held the mantle for more than three decades. In a little less than 11 months\u2019 time we will finally find out, after Dettori\u2019s disclosure to ITV Racing on Saturday that the 2023 Flat season will be his final campaign in the saddle.\nDettori, as he always intended, will bow out at the top, probably on 4 November 2023 at the Breeders\u2019 Cup meeting at Santa Anita, the track where he steered Raven\u2019s Pass to the first \u2013 and still only \u2013 success for a British-trained runner in the Breeders\u2019 Cup Classic.\n\nThat is just one among dozens of highlights on Dettori\u2019s showreel, which opens with a big-race double at Ascot in September 1990, when he was three months shy of his 20th birthday, and includes the unforgettable afternoon at the same track in 1996 when he went straight through the seven-race card. Dubai Millennium, Swain, Ouija Board, Fantastic Light, Golden Horn, Enable and Stradivarius are just a handful of the champions that earned their place in the pantheon with Dettori holding the reins.\n\u201cIt is a very difficult decision because my heart wants to carry on riding,\u201d Dettori said. \u201cBut I have had to use my brain and I\u2019ve just turned 52 and next year I\u2019ll be 53. I want to be competitive enough to do my owners and my horses justice next year and I think I\u2019m still in that bracket of being good. It was difficult, but it is the right time.\n\u201cI spoke to my dad [the former Italian champion Gianfranco] at length. My dad stopped at 51, he is very supporting and I also had to speak to my wife and children, who are delighted because they have barely seen me for 35 years.\n\u201cI\u2019ve decided with the firepower I have next year, I can finish my career on a big note. Fingers crossed, I stay in one piece and we\u2019ll give it a good go next year. Look at Ronaldo, one day he was playing and he\u2019s on the bench the next. I don\u2019t want to end up like that and end up where I\u2019m struggling to get rides in the big races. At the moment I still have good horses to ride and I want to finish like that.\u201d\n\nFrom his earliest days as a teenaged apprentice \u2013 and the first fledgling rider since Piggott to ride 100 winners in a season \u2013 horses have always run for Dettori. His immense natural talent and horsemanship found an ideal foil in the trainer Luca Cumani, who steered him through some difficult early years in Newmarket dealing with his celebrity status, which included a caution for possession of cocaine in April 1993.\n\nThe following year, he teamed up with Sheikh Mohammed\u2019s embryonic Godolphin operation, at the start of a 20-year run of almost unbroken success on the track in their royal blue silks. The first of his three Flat jockeys\u2019 championships arrived the same year, when his final total of 233 winners was the highest for 45 years.\nThe nadir of Dettori\u2019s two decades with Godolphin was the plane crash in June 2000 which claimed the life of his pilot, Patrick Mackey. He was pulled from the burning wreckage by his fellow rider Ray Cochrane, and returned to the saddle only two months later.\nBy then, Dettori was already firmly established as one of the sporting world\u2019s most familiar names, thanks in part to his magnificent seven at Ascot in 1996 but also his natural ebullience in front of the cameras. Where Piggott, his predecessor as the betting public\u2019s go-to jockey, shied away from interviews and microphones, Dettori embraced celebrity easily and instinctively, reaching new audiences via shows as varied as A Question Of Sport and Loose Women.\nDettori was, in his later years, a flawed hero too, forced to rebuild his career in the post-Godolphin days after a six-month ban for testing positive for cocaine in September 2012. He checked in to the Celebrity Big Brother house while serving his suspension, then returned to his day job in May 2013 with his talent undimmed but a host of young and hungry rivals ahead of him in many trainers\u2019 pecking orders.\nThe 10 seasons since have seen Dettori enjoy an Indian summer in association with John Gosden\u2019s powerhouse yard in Newmarket. A typically brilliant ride from a wide draw aboard Golden Horn in the 2015 Prix de l\u2019Arc de Triomphe further cemented his status as one of the few individuals in any sport for whom no surname is required, while Enable and Stradivarius ran up long sequences of wins in Group One events.\nDettori\u2019s 11-month farewell tour will give his public every chance to say goodbye and will no doubt be emotional at times, with his last Guineas meeting, last Derby and last Royal Ascot all leading towards a final wave to the fans at the Breeders\u2019 Cup in California.\nThe last of his 14 winners at the meeting \u2013 a record for a European-based rider \u2013 came in 2018, but who would bet against one last flying dismount by Dettori against the backdrop of the San Gabriel mountains in November?"

                    "body": "  8.40am   Read our match report       6.08am    An excellent result by England who managed to turn around a terrible slump of form - the Ashes followed by losing the first three matches of this World Cup - just in time to scratch a way to the semi-final. Heather Knight remains an unappreciated inspirational captain, Dunkley a brilliant young cricketer and Ecclestone a superstar. I\u2019m going to bed before I get sucked into South Africa v India - Deepti has just bowled a beauty and South Africa are 2-0 after two overs. Thanks for all the emails, see you on Wednesday at an ungodly hour!     5.58am    Sophia Dunkley wins the player of the match award for that 67 off 72 balls on a slow pitch. Bangladesh finish seventh in the table in their first World Cup, and with more exposure will come increased ambition.  And finally, Raf\u2019s maths says that \u201cEngland are through and probably 3rd. India would need to bowl South Africa out for 147* to overhaul them on NRR.\u201d That chase is about to start over in Christchurch.  Updated at 5.59am BST    5.52am    Ok - so as for the semi-finals... England join Australia and South Africa, and will be joined by one of India or West Indies, depending on the result in Christchurch later on today. If, as looks likely, India beat South Africa then we are looking at South Africa v England at Wellington on Wednesday and <i>Australia v India at Christchurch on Thursday.</i> but nothing is yet certain....     5.45am   WICKET! Ritu c Cross b Davies 11 (Bangladesh 134 all out) England win by 100 runs  48th over : Bangladesh 134 all out (Jahanara 3) An over-pitched ball from Davies is cover-carved by Ritu for four, before she shovels to mid-off and that is that!       5.40am    47th over : Bangladesh 129-9 ( Ritu 7, Jahanara 2) Dean whizzes through another.     5.39am    46th over : Bangladesh 128-9 ( Ritu 7, Jahanara 1) We glance at the England team who look as if they\u2019ve all been put in cold storage. Katherine Brunt, incidentally, is no-where to be seen and has been off the field for two thirds of this innings.  India have finished 274-7 over in Christchurch. I will be getting back to you on the semi-finals, belatedly, too much happening!     5.36am   WICKET! Fahima run-out 0 (Bangladesh 128-8)  Bangladesh fly for a quick single, Wyatt flings the ball in to Jones, who takes it a foot above the stumps but whips the bails off and Fahima is out by a nose.      5.33am    45th over : Bangladesh 127-8 ( Ritu 7, Fahima 0) Dean finishes a productive over. On comms, Alex Hartley points out that if Dean pockets the last two wickets, she\u2019ll have an international five-fer before Sophie Ecclestone.     5.31am   WICKET!  Nahida b Dean 0 (Bangladesh 127-8)  Yorked! Nahida can\u2019t get bat on a straight one and the stumps are coconut shied.     5.29am   WICKET! Lata  c Cross b Dean  30 (Bangladesh 126-7)  An emboldened Lata goes big but can only slop the ball to Cross at mid-on. Sweep to disaster in this game.      5.27am    44th over : Bangladesh 126-6 ( Lata 30, Ritu 7) With 109 need off 36 balls this is all rather a formality, but Lata looking impressively frisky with the bat.     5.26am    43rd over : Bangladesh 122-6 ( Lata 28, Ritu 5) A couple of runs off the smiling Dean.  \u201cHi Tanya, just to say hi from Bahia! Got home now after a good night dancing to some great samba... just caught up with the score. All will be well right? Am not even gonna talk about the boys, the girls are gonna do it, aren\u2019t they? Beijos Cressida\u201d Cressida, is Bahia, northern Brazil? One day I\u2019ll come dancing in the small hours to the great samba with you. In the mean time, rest those dancing feet.     5.22am    42nd over : Bangladesh 121-6 ( Lata 28, Ritu 4) A sudden glut for Bangladesh, and Lata, as two boundaries come off Davies over: a cut and a lofted drive which beats a stodgy jam roly-poly bit of fielding on the rope.     5.19am    41st over : Bangladesh 112-6 ( Lata 20, Ritu 3) Knight whips through an over, and gets away with a full toss.      5.16am    40th over : Bangladesh 108-6 ( Lata 17, Ritu 2) The boundary shackles are broken, as Lata pulls Davies to the rope. A vague run-out chance, but the throw isn\u2019t pin-point and Ritu gets back.     5.13am    39th over : Bangladesh 102-6 ( Lata 12, Ritu 1) The game slip-slides away.     5.10am   WICKET! Salma c Davies b Knight 2 (Bangladesh 101-6)  Yet another top-edged sweep, yet another catch for Davies!  Updated at 5.12am BST    5.09am    38th over : Bangladesh 101-5 ( Lata 12, Salma 1) Ecclestone finishes her sublime spell with a maiden and figures of 10-4-15-3.     5.07am    37th over : Bangladesh 101-5 ( Lata 12, Salma 1) Five pinched singles off Knight.     5.05am    36th over : Bangladesh 96-5 (Lata 9, Salma 0) Tis Ecclestone, doing what Ecclestone does: long sleeves, flash of cream across her nose and... yes... another wicket! She currently has 3-15. \u201cGreetings from sunny Wellington! Very much enjoying my first ever Women\u2019s ODI today, especially the way it seems to be going. Bangladesh are running out of time and ideas. Jones doing an exceptional job standing up to the stumps for Davies. \u201cDo we know yet which teams play at which venue in the semis? Hoping to come back on Wednesday to see England at the Basin but websites are being very coy about how it all shakes out!\u201d You lucky thing, Ed Kay - looks like a great atmosphere. As far as I know the semi-finals look like this (to be continued...)  Updated at 5.07am BST    5.01am   WICKET! Jota c Davies b Ecclestone 22 (Bangladesh 96-5)  A top-edged sweep swooped and held at short-fine leg by a smiling Davies  Updated at 5.02am BST    4.57am    35th over : Bangladesh 95-4( Joty 22, Lata 8) A mere single from Knight as the players gather for the last DRINKS break o the match. I think we can safely say England have won this game as Bangladesh plump for batting out the overs rather than risk-taking.     4.55am    34th over : Bangladesh 94-4( Joty 22, Lata 7)     4.52am    33rd over : Bangladesh 91-4( Joty 22, Lata 4) Heather Knight twirls her arm over, the wind buffeting her long-sleeved jumper. Tap, tap, tap, Bangladesh bundle through their singles as the dog side-eyes me for accidentally kicking her.  \u201cJust trying to wake you up from Brisbane,\u201d bellows Evelyn Williams, \u201cwhere I\u2019m following the OBO while preparing to go to an NRL game (Queensland derby - Broncos v Cowboys). Good time for us to watch the cricket but sometimes other sports interfere.\u201d Enjoy! And thanks for the ear tweak, my eyelids are definitely struggling tonight.  Updated at 4.54am BST    4.47am    31st over: Bangladesh 87-4( Joty 20, Lata 1) A fistful of runs off Dean. \u2018Hi Tanya,\u201d Finbar Anslow, hello! \u201cHow are you doing, have woken up impossibly early having foolishly volunteered to help with the breakfast at a local boarding school, have also been fiendishly robbed of another hour\u2019s sleep by some faceless beauracrat; please give me some good news.\u201d I hope you are rewarded with a beautiful dawn and freshly-brewed coffee. Good news, you say? In this tainted world, the best I can come up with is that England are going to make the semi-finals, having picked their campaign out of the dust. Shall we ignore events in Grenada?     4.41am    30th over: Bangladesh 81-4( Joty 16, Lata 0) Lovely bowling by Davies, justly rewarded as Bangladesh start to slip and slide.     4.39am   WICKTE! Rumana b Davies 6 (Bangladesh 81-4)  Rumana flings the bat and gets only an inside edge onto the stumps. An offcutter to smooch to.     4.36am    29th over: Bangladesh 78-3 ( Joty 16, Rumana 4) I love New Zealand grounds - cricket perfection. Kids running around on the grass, friends picnicking while chewing the cud.      4.34am    28th over: Bangladesh 76-3 ( Joty 15, Rumana 3) Just a single from Davies\u2019s over at idyllic, green, green Wellington     4.32am    27th over: Bangladesh 75-3 ( Joty 14, Rumana 3)) A wicket for Dean and then a small flurry of runs as Joty flings the back and edges behind. Mine eyes are heavy - if you\u2019re out there, do drop me a mail for a chat about this and that.     4.27am   WICKET! PInky c Sciver b Dean 11 (Bangladesh 70-3)  Step and drive to mid-on, where Sciver is lurking.     4.26am    26th over: Bangladesh 69-2 (Pinky 11, Joty 11) Davies, in for the rested Shrubsole, hair tied back in a high ponytail, bounds in: a wide and three runs through mid-wicket and fine-leg. Some helpful confirmation from the radio - whichever of India or England win their game (assuming they do) by a bigger margin will avoid Australia in the semis.  Updated at 4.28am BST    4.21am    25th over: Bangladesh 65-2 (Pinky 8, Joty 11) Joty sweeps a laggardly leg-side ball from Dean for four, and repeats off the last ball, with the same result.  Updated at 4.28am BST    4.18am    24th over: Bangladesh 57-2 (Pinky 8, Joty 3) Freya Davies has a bowl in her first competitive game since February 8. Short steps, like a horse dancing, as she approaches the crease. Five dots, and just a couple off the last ball as Pinky tipples her off her pads.   Updated at 4.28am BST    4.13am    23rd over: Bangladesh 55-2 (Pinky 6, Joty 3) Dean in her sunglasses zips through another over, and a watchful Bangladesh pick up four singles.     4.11am    22nd over: Bangladesh 51-2 (Pinky 4, Joty 1) An Ecclestone maiden, as Pinky edges just short of Knight at slip.     4.10am    21st over: Bangladesh 51-2 (Pinky 4, Joty 1) Knight throws the ball to young Charlie Dean and Bangladesh are characteristically cautious. A single here, a single there, dib-dab as the run-rate disappears sky-ward.     4.07am    20th over: Bangladesh 49-2 (Pinky 3, Joty 0) Pinky picks up a couple through point, but another smashing over from Ecclestone: England\u2019s not-at-all secret, but highly effective weapon.  Updated at 4.08am BST    4.04am   WICKET! Shamima c Cross b Ecclestone 23 (Bangladesh 47-2)  Scoreboard pressure gnaws away at Shamima who throws the bat at Ecclestone but only sends the ball up and to Cross at mid-off.  Updated at 4.08am BST    4.02am    19th over: Bangladesh 47-1 (Pinky 1, Shamima 23) At this stage, the TV stats tell us, England were 68-2. A better over for Bangladesh though, as they pick up five, with Shamima swinging for glory, but not making the rope as the balls slows before the rope.     3.58am    18th over: Bangladesh 42-1 (Pinky 0, Shamima 19) A wicket maiden for Ecclestone, as she collects her 12th wicket of the World Cup and they pause for drinks.     3.54am   WICKET! Supta b Ecclestone 23 (Bangladesh 42-1)  Skids off that shiny pitch and through the defences  Updated at 3.56am BST    3.53am    17th over: Bangladesh 42-0 (Supta 23, Shamima 19) Another boundary as Shamima throws the kitchen sink at Cross and the ball flies over mid-wicket and over the rope.     3.49am    16th over: Bangladesh 37-0 (Supta 22, Shamima 15) Shot of the innings as Shamima shimmies down to Ecclestone and picks up and hits for four over mid-on. Four beautiful balls follow with Shamima lucky not to be snaffled and on her way.     3.46am    15th over: Bangladesh 33-0 (Supta 22, Shamima 11) I run to the kitchen to find something -anything- to eat and return, disappointingly, with a hastily-grabbed bag of Krisprolls. Just in time to see Cross collect four from a thick edge though the slips.     3.41am    14th over: Bangladesh 29-0 (Supta 18, Shamima 11) Shamima defends Ecclestone, then misses a sweep, mistimes a hit over midwicket and returns to first gear.Another maiden.  Updated at 3.43am BST    3.39am    13th over: Bangladesh 29-0 (Supta 18, Shamima 11) Cross fiddles with her hair and bounds in, all sports\u2019 captain enthusiasm. Only a couple of singles and Bangladesh are at risk of becoming marooned here.   Updated at 3.42am BST    3.37am    12th over: Bangladesh 27-0 (Supta 17, Shamima 10) The first drop of the innings as Danni Wyatt sprints in at deep square to pick up Shamima\u2019s top-edged sweep, but fluffs it uncharacteristically, I think it flies off her thumb. Ecclestone turns pensively.     3.34am    11th over: Bangladesh 23-0 (Supta 17, Shamima 8) A bustling Cross, moves through her first over without incident.     3.29am    10th over: Bangladesh 23-0 (Supta 16, Shamima 7) Ladies and gentlemen, we have spin. Ecclestone, in sunglasses and long-sleeves has the ball, long blond plait creeping down her back. Shamima picks up a couple from a top-edged sweep and that\u2019s the end of the power play with England well on top.     3.25am    9th over: Bangladesh 20-0 (Supta 15, Shamima 5) Shamima is batting like a woman nervously prodding the long grass for snakes. Another maiden for Brunt folded neatly and tucked into her trouser pocket.      3.22am    8th over: Bangladesh 20-0 (Supta 15, Shamima 5) Suddenly delicious for Bangladesh, as Supta on-drives and square-drives for four in successive balls as Sciver over-pitches.   Updated at 3.24am BST    3.18am    7th over: Bangladesh 12-0 (Supta 7, Shamima 5) The pitch is mirror shiny, the sky blue and the cool wind running in behind Katherine Brunt, who serves up another maiden.  Updated at 3.24am BST    3.15am    6th over: Bangladesh 12-0 (Supta 7, Shamima 5) Ooof, a nasty top edge into Shamima\u2019s grill as she tries to pull Sciver but miscues. The physio runs out and does the usual checks and all is ticked off to carry on.   Updated at 3.24am BST    3.10am    5th over: Bangladesh 11-0 (Supta 7, Shamima 4)Brunt has ants in her pants this afternoon, fizzing with aggression as she rattles along. Just a couple of runs from her over as Bangladesh start most sedately.     3.05am    4th over: Bangladesh 9-0 (Supta 5, Shamima 4) Over in Christchurch, India are making hay - 91 for one after 15 overs, though Shafali Verma has just been run out for 53. Should India win at a suitable clip, they can overtake England\u2019s net run-rate and England could find themselves facing Australia in the semi-finals. Sciver rattles through a second maiden.      3.02am    3rd over: Bangladesh 9-0 (Supta 5, Shamima 4) A maiden from Brunt, marred by a strangely aggressive throw from Brunt to Supta after her fifth ball, which a surprised Supta blocks away. Brunt is suitably chastised by the umpire.      3.00am    2nd over: Bangladesh 9-0 (Supta 5, Shamima 4) Sciver gets the new ball at the other end, in the absence of Shrubsole who has been rested. The win predictor hands England a whopping 94 per cent chance as Sciver is on the money straight away.     2.55am    1st over: Bangladesh 5-0 (Supta 4, Shamima 1)Bangladesh start with the dodgiest of singles but Dunkley uncharacteristically freezes in the covers and throws to the wrong end so a dead-cert run out becomes a just-in run. Brunt\u2019s final ball is shimmied into the leg side for four.     2.50am    Right, here we go. Katherine Brunt has the ball and we\u2019re off.     2.47am    Thanks Jim and welcome to British Summer Time! England have celebrated in pretty good time- my hunch says 235 is too many for Bangladesh, admirably though they stuck to their task. Admittedly, my hunch has been wrong before. Win this, remember, and England are through to the semi-finals.      2.41am    That\u2019s it from me. I\u2019ve just glanced at the clock and become very confused by the clocks whizzing forward an hour. The brilliant Tanya Aldred is here to take you through Bangladesh\u2019s chase - if England can stop them hauling down the target of 235 runs then the semi-finals await.  Thanks for your company, goodbye!     2.38am    Here\u2019s some interval reading on the star of England\u2019s innings:       2.37am         2.23am   50th over: England 234-6 (Brunt 24, Ecclestone 17)  The last ball of the innings brings the first six for England! Sophie Ecclestone getting a good contact on a swipe into the leg side. England finish strongly but credit to Bangladesh who bowled and fielded well and kept to their task admirably. Game on!      2.17am    49th over: England 221-6 (Brunt 21, Ecclestone 6) One over to go, England more or less throwing the Belfast at everything.      2.14am   Wicket! Dunkley st Nigar Sultana b Salma Khatun 67  End of a highly impressive innings. Dunkley trots down the wicket to heave one away into the leg side but misses the ball and is out by acres as Sultana swishes off the bails. The young batter has got England into a solid position with that knock.  48th over: England 214-6 (Brunt 20, Ecclestone 2)     2.10am    47th over: England 210-5 (Dunkley 67, Brunt 18) Dunkley on the attack once more, she rocks back and pulls for four. Another fruitful over for England is worth nine runs to the total.      2.06am    46th over: England 201-5 (Dunkley 60, Brunt 16) 14 scrappy runs from the over! Mis-cued hoicks, mis-timed drives and misfortune for the bowler as a series of edges fly away.      2.01am    45th over: England 187-5 (Dunkley 54, Brunt 8) England pick up seven off the over. Five to go - what can they get up to here? Anything 230 or above would help them breathe a bit easier when they take the field.   Updated at 2.06am BST    12.59am    44th over: England 180-5 (Dunkley 50, Brunt 5) Fifty for Sophia Dunkley! She\u2019s played a gem of an innings here. She gets there with another drive to the cover fence and a well judged single. Well batted!     12.55am    43rd over: England 172-5 (Dunkley 44, Brunt 3) Katherine Brunt is the new batter. This is definitely worth a read:       12.50am   Wicket! Jones ct Salma Khatun b Lata Mondal 31 (England 168-5)  Gone this time though! Jones leans back on a drive and is caught at cover.      12.47am    42nd over: England 168-4 (Jones 31, Dunkley 44) Drop! Jones gets a meaty edge to a wide-ish ball from Nahida but the keeper can\u2019t cling on stood up to the stumps.      12.44am    41st over: England 167-4 (Jones 30, Dunkley 44) Back to medium-pace as Jahanara returns to the attack. Amy Jones drives her on the up through the covers for four! Shot of the day for my moolah. Dunkley then finds the fence with a powerfully struck drive. 12 from the over, England on the move.      12.39am    40th over: England 155-4 (Jones 25, Dunkley 37) Four off Salma\u2019s seventh over. Big final ten overs. England have a chance to go through the gears here with six wickets still in hand.      12.36am    39th over: England 151-4 (Jones 24, Dunkley 34) Shot! Dunkley launches a drive over the fielders and holds the pose. If you can\u2019t get through \u2018em... go over \u2018em. Singles worked off the rest.  Fifty-partnership for Jones and Dunkley. 150 up for England.   Updated at 12.37am GMT    12.33am    38th over: England 143-4 (Jones 22, Dunkley 28) Just a couple from it, Dunkley drives powerfully a couple of times but finds the fielder on both occasions.      12.28am    37th over: England 141-4 (Jones 21, Dunkley 27) Seven from the over, this pair beginning to up the intent slightly, rotating the strike well.      12.26am    36th over: England 134-4 (Jones 19, Dunkley 24) Salma Khatun is back into the attack, Dunkley manages to back-cut her away for four. The youngster is playing another meaningful innings here.      12.22am    35th over: England 129-4 (Jones 18, Dunkley 18) Roly-poly-ever-so-slowly. Just a single to Amy Jones.      12.19am    34th over: England 128-4 (Jones 17, Dunkley 18) Three taken from Rumana\u2019s over. Lydia Greenway on comms wants Dunkley and Jones to keep rotating strike until at least 40 overs before having a dart.       12.15am    33rd over: England 125-4 (Jones 16, Dunkley 18) Buzzers! Dunkley picks up a bonus few runs thanks to some sloppy backing-up straight away after drinks. One-becomes-three as the Spice Girls didn\u2019t sing.      12.10am    32nd over: England 121-4 (Jones 15, Dunkley 15) Drinks. Single to each batter off the new bowler, leg-spinner Rumana Ahmed. 18 overs to go and England need to finish strongly in the last third of their innings. It\u2019s been tough going so far. Bangladesh have been impressive.    Updated at 12.11am GMT    12.05am    31st over: England 119-4 (Jones 14, Dunkley 14) Dunkley releases the pressure valve ever so slightly with a lofted drive over mid-on for four. Shot! Better over for England with seven taken from it. Ritu Moni finishes with 1-36 from her ten overs.  Updated at 12.06am GMT    12.03am    30th over: England 108-4 (Jones 11, Dunkley 10) There have been 105 dots so far in the innings and just the six boundaries. It\u2019s been another constriction job by Bangladesh. 20 overs to go.       12.01am    29th over: England 108-4 (Jones 10, Dunkley 7) Just a single to Dunkley.       11.58pm    28th over: England 107-4 (Jones 10, Dunkley 6) Sophia Dunkley sweeps for four. Two new batters at the crease and at the risk of a JINX they both look in good knick, reading the pace of the pitch well and playing their shots confidently.      11.55pm    27th over: England 100-4 (Jones 9, Dunkley 0)      11.51pm   Wicket! Sciver lbw b Fahima Khatun 40  Sweep for four by Sciver. Welcome boundary. England\u2019s first since the 17th. Amy Jones then makes it another with a fantastic in-to-out drive through the covers. BUT then Nat Sciver is given out on review! WOW. It looked innocuous, Sciver was down the track and looking to flick away but she missed the ball and Bangladesh review more in hope... but three reds and it is whoops of delight for the fielding side. Sciver can\u2019t believe it. She shakes her head as she departs for the hutch.  26th over: England 96-4 (Jones 5, Dunkley 0)   Updated at 11.53pm GMT    11.44pm    25th over: England 86-2 (Sciver 35, Jones) Wicket maiden for Ritu Moni. She has 1-24 from seven overs. Amy Jones is the new batter. we\u2019re halfway through. Cagey. Cautious. Can England creep to a par score?      11.41pm   Wicket! Beaumont ct Fahima Khatun b Ritu Moni 33 (England 86-3)  Call me Nostrajamus... Beaumont tried to go aerial but her bottom hand comes off the bat and she plinks to cover. 69 balls for her 33, a patient but largely frustrating knock for the opener.      11.38pm    24th over: England 86-2 (Beaumont 33, Sciver 35) Three singles. Get the feeling Beaumont is starting to get frustrated here. She keeps finding the fielders.      11.35pm    23rd over: England 83-2 (Beaumont 31, Sciver 34) No fireworks but five singles.       11.32pm    22nd over: England 78-2 (Beaumont 28, Sciver 32) Four singles, England happy to cautiously compile. As an aside - Bangladesh have never chased more than 211 runs in a fifty over match.      11.28pm    21st over: England 74-2 (Beaumont 26, Sciver 30) A late, teasingly late cut by Sciver, so late she basically glided it out of the keeper\u2019s gloves. She has finesse to go with the power and will need all of it on this slightly stodgy wicket.      11.25pm    20th over: England 70-2 (Beaumont 25, Sciver 27) Nearly a run out! A quick single results in Tammy Beaumont on the turf enacting a full length dive for her ground. It would have been close, as it happens Nahida missed the stumps after she\u2019d gathered the ball at the non-strikers end.   Updated at 11.28pm GMT    11.22pm    19th over: England 68-2 (Beaumont 24, Sciver 26) Sciver goes for a big yahoooo into the leg side, the ball goes soaring and swirling in the wind... and lands safe.      11.19pm    18th over: England 64-2 (Beaumont 23, Sciver 23) England happy to nudge and nurdle. Bangladesh happy for them to do so.       11.17pm    17th over: England 60-2 (Beaumont 21, Sciver 22) The BIG shot does come! Nat Sciver drives over the top for four. Lovely, she kept her shape and was always in control. There\u2019s a couple of singles too but Ritu gets out of the over with three dots.      11.13pm    16th over: England 54-2 (Beaumont 20, Sciver 17) Still no boundaries coming for England, there\u2019s a slight sense of frustration creeping in, especially for Nat Sciver. Wonder if a big shot is in the offing. That\u2019s exactly want Bangladesh want of course.      11.09pm    15th over: England 51-2 (Beaumont 18, Sciver 16) Fifty up for England. Both batters are just struggling to get used to the pace of the wicket. The ball isn\u2019t coming on, especially as Ritu Moni is just placing it on a length, stump to stump. Stifling stuff.      11.03pm    14th over: England 47-2 (Beaumont 16, Sciver 14) Drinks. A cagey first installment of this game. Someone is going to take it by the scruff of the neck in the next hour or so. Time for a brew.      11.00pm    13th over: England 44-2 (Beaumont 15, Sciver 12) Just a single off Ritu\u2019s first. Bit of a plod so far for England, they are going at 3.38 runs per over.   Updated at 11.01pm GMT    10.56pm    12th over: England 43-2 (Beaumont 15, Sciver 11) England can\u2019t break the shackles. Ritu Moni is going to float down some medium pacers with the keeper stood up to the stumps.      10.52pm    11th over: England 39-2 (Beaumont 14, Sciver 8) Just a couple from the over. 19 year old left-arm spinner Nahida Akter is coming into the attack.     10.47pm    10th over: England 37-2 (Beaumont 13, Sciver 7) Powerplay done and dusted. Sciver looks busy, cutting and driving to pick up five from the over. The suns is fully out now in Wellington, so that\u2019s something.      10.45pm    9th over: England 32-2 (Beaumont 12, Sciver 3) Beaumont picks up two with a well placed clip through mid-wicket. She\u2019s been consistent in this World Cup without yet posting a match defining score. Today Tammy eh?  Updated at 10.45pm GMT    10.42pm    8th over: England 30-2 (Beaumont 10, Sciver 3) Two early wickets gone for England then, that won\u2019t settle the jitters. Nat Sciver is the new batter and she\u2019s into her work with a single to fine leg and a whip off the pads for two.      10.39pm   Wicket! Knight ct Nigar Sultana b Salma Khatun  The captain is gone! Caught by her opposite number behind the stumps. Salma Khatun bowled her the doosra and it was too close too cut, a spike on the snicko betrays Knight and she has to trudge off.      10.36pm    7th over: England 24-1 (Beaumont 9, Knight 4) Just a couple from a Knight sweep. Bangladesh bowling tidily, keeping the pressure on England.   Updated at 10.41pm GMT    10.30pm         10.29pm    6th over: England 20-1 (Beaumont 9, Knight 4) Cat and mouse stuff from Salma and Tammy Beaumont, the batter looking to attack but the bowler landing the ball on a dime. A paddle to the vacant \u201845 area brings a couple. The pitch looks a bit two-paced, Nasser reckons a score of 220 would be decent.   Updated at 10.41pm GMT    10.25pm    5th over: England 18-1 (Beaumont 7, Knight 1) Skipper Knight is at the crease early again. She\u2019s off the mark immediately with a flick to mid-wicket for a leisurely single.   Updated at 10.41pm GMT    10.23pm   WICKET! Wyatt ct Fahima Khatun b Jahanara Alam 6 (England 16-1)  Gone! England lose Wyatt - scything in the air to point and the catch is taken! England remain the only side in the tournament not to post an opening partnership of fifty so far in the tournament.   Updated at 10.24pm GMT    10.21pm    4th over: England 14-0 (Beaumont 7, Wyatt 6) Tight over from Salma, just a Wyatt single off it.   England will go through with a win. How they do it, net run-rate wise could affect who they end up playing in the semis, with obviously Australia the side to avoid. Whoever finishes in fourth place will face Meg Lanning and co. At the moment it could be England, India or, if one of those two lose today, West Indies.      10.14pm         10.13pm    3rd over: England 13-0 (Beaumont 7, Wyatt 5) A nicely timed push for two through the covers from Beaumont brings the only runs from the over.     10.10pm    2nd over: England 11-0 (Beaumont 5, Wyatt 5) Salma Khatun\u2019s spin. Salma starts with four dots before she drops short and Wyatt pounces to carve her square for four.   Updated at 10.11pm GMT    10.06pm    1st over: England 7-0 (Beaumont 5, Wyatt 1) Beaumont nudges one into leg to get England\u2019s cause underway. Jahanara struggles with her run up slightly as she did in the windy conditions against Australia. It looks a lot brighter and less blustery in Wellington today. Wyatt gets off the mark with a single too. Four! Beaumont drives through cover for the first boundary of the game. England are up \u2018n\u2019 runnin.      10.02pm    Danni Wyatt and Tammy Beaumont take guard on this used Wellington wicket. Jahanara Alam has the ball in hand. Let\u2019s play!     9.56pm    The players head out for the anthems. There\u2019s just about enough blue sky to make a sailor a pair of trousers, as my ol\u2019 Ma would say. No idea either, she lives in landlocked Derbyshire.      9.52pm    Nasser says it is \u201ccloudy, windy and cold\u201d in Wellington.   Speaking of Nasser...     9.50pm    England: Tammy Beaumont, Danielle Wyatt, *Heather Knight, Natalie Sciver, +Amy Jones, Sophia Dunkley, Katherine Brunt, Sophie Ecclestone, Kate Cross, Charlotte Dean, Freya Davies. Bangladesh: Sharmin Akhter, Shamima Sultana, Fargana Hoque, *+Nigar Sultana, Rumana Ahmed, Ritu Moni, Lata Mondal, Salma Khatun, Fahima Khatun, Nahida Akter, Jahanara Alam.      9.46pm   England win the toss...  They\u2019ll have a bat     9.44pm   Preamble  Hello and welcome to the night of nights for England\u2019s female cricketers. A win against Bangladesh, who incidentally they have never met before in 50 over cricket, will see them grab a spot in the semi-finals.  It\u2019s been a topsy-turvy campaign by England. They were gaping down the barrel of an early World Cup Exit after three defeats at the start of the tournament, ever since then it\u2019s been pressure on - effectively playing elimination cricket in every match since.  Heather Knight will be desperately hoping that her side\u2019s 2022 World Cup journey in New Zealand continues to go the way of the tortoise and the hare. That their ugly duckling early performances of dropped catches and wayward bowling continue to transform into something swan-like as the competition reaches the sharp end. Lose against Bangladesh today though and it will be Goodnight, Moon.  The signs are promising, some of those who had been having a \u2018quieter\u2019 time of it have stepped up. Danni Wyatt was in the runs and Katherine Brunt the wickets in the defeat of Pakistan. Kate Cross, Sophie Ecclestone, Nat Sciver and Sophia Dunkley have all performed consistently, so to the skipper herself.  \u201cEveryone is peaking at the right time going into this game and then hopefully the semi-finals\u2026 it\u2019s not how you start, it\u2019s how you finish,\u201d declared opener Tammy Beaumont in the run up to today\u2019s match at the Basin Reserve in Wellington.  They won\u2019t be taking Bangladesh lightly. Nigar Sultana\u2019s side have beaten Pakistan and pushed both West Indies and India close. They nearly pulled off the shock of the tournament at a blustery Basin Reserve just a couple of days ago, reducing the unbeaten Aussies to 70-5 chasing a tricksy target of 135. If they\u2019d been more proactive with the bat earlier on the piece then they could have pulled off a spectacular upset. They have a spin contingent that could damage England, especially with all the pressure on pale blue shoulders. I predict a bum-squeaker.  Play starts at 10pm GMT/11 AM local time. Jim here with the call for the first half before Tanya takes over in the wee small hours. I\u2019ll be back shortly with news of the toss and the teams. As ever do get in touch with your musings and mirth. You can whang me an email or fling me a tweet.  "

                    "body": "International pledges of emergency aid have poured in for Turkey and Syria, leading to calls for the international community to relax some of the political restrictions on aid entering north-west Syria, the country\u2019s last rebel-held enclave and one of the areas worst hit by the earthquake. With the support of Russia at the UN, the government in Damascus allows aid to enter the region through only one border crossing. The Syrian Association for Citizens Dignity said all crossings must be opened on an emergency basis. The crisis is likely to be a test of whether a divided international community riven by the war in Ukraine and conflicts in the Middle East can temporarily bury its differences in the interests of addressing a humanitarian emergency. The Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, who is facing an election in a few months, said offers of aid to Turkey had come from 45 countries ranging from Kuwait to Israel, Russia and the UK. Syria said it had received offers of help from China, Russia, Lebanon, Algeria and the United Arab Emirates. But the scale of the aid being offered will require a large coordination effort, as well delicate diplomatic manoeuvres to supply aid to Syria where the leadership of Bashar al-Assad is not recognised in the west. By Monday afternoon the number of dead in northern Syria had reached 840, about a half of the fast-rising death toll in Turkey of 1,541. The Syrian side of the border may provide a greater aid challenge since some of the worst-affected areas contain hundreds of thousands of Syrian refugees locked in a war zone and facing attacks from Syrian government forces. Aid agencies reported that some of the roads from Turkey into Syria were blocked, including the main cross border crossing used by international aid agencies. The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, said the US was already assessing its comprehensive response options, \u201cand had directed my team to remain in close contact with our Turkish allies and our humanitarian partners in the coming days to determine what the region needs\u201d. He added: \u201cWe are determined to do all that we can to help those affected by these earthquakes in the days, weeks, and months ahead.\u201d The EU said it had mobilised its emergency coordination centre and rescue teams in the Netherlands and Romania. The bloc\u2019s foreign affairs chief, Josep Borrell, said: \u201cTen urban search and rescue teams have been quickly mobilised from Bulgaria, Croatia, [the Czech Republic], France, Greece, the Netherlands, Poland [and] Romania to support the first responders on the ground. Italy and Hungary have offered their rescue teams to Turkey as well.\u201d The EU\u2019s Copernicus satellite system has been activated to provide emergency mapping services.  Other countries offering help included Ukraine, whose president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, sent a message offering condolences. The French President Emmanuel Macron said he was despatching a 139 strong civilian rescue team and the US announced it was sending two search and rescue teams each 79 strong. Soldiers from Azerbaijan were the fist to arrive in Turkey to offer practical support sending 400 fully equipped soldiers. Russia said it had emergency rescue Ilyushin-76 planes on standby to fly to the two countries. Its defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, ordered Russian forces in Syria to help with the rescue effort, including from the naval base at Tartus. Tobias Billstr\u00f6m, the Swedish foreign affairs minister, tweeted: \u201cI deeply regret the terrible consequences of the earthquake in Turkey and Syria with a high loss of lives. As Sweden holds the EU presidency we are going to reach out to the Turkish foreign affairs minister, Mevl\u00fct \u00c7avu\u015fo\u011flu, and to Syria for the coordination of EU efforts to aid these countries in this disaster.\u201d Sweden has been at loggerheads with Turkey over Erdo\u011fan\u2019s refusal to allow it into Nato. Erdo\u011fan\u2019s ability to oversee the crisis and to cooperate with countries that he sometimes antagonises will be a critical test for him before the presidential election due on 14 May. The opposition, seeking to capitalise on the dire state of the economy, was due to select its candidate next Monday, but depending on how the crisis unfolds in the next few days it may have to postpone making its choice. The White Helmets, the western-backed NGO that has rescued thousands of people from bombed buildings during the Syrian civil war, said adverse weather conditions including freezing temperatures had compounded the crisis. It urged the Assad regime and Russia to refrain from military activity in the affected areas to allow international groups to unify to help people affected. A spokesperson in Syria said: \u201cOur teams responded and until now many families are under the rubble. Our teams are trying hard to help all the casualties. North-west Syria is now a disaster area. We need help from everyone to save our people.\u201d Last month, the UN security council agreed to allow aid into north-west Syria from Turkey across one border crossing, at Bab al-Hawa. Syria has been resistant to allowing aid into a region serving more than 4 million people because it regards the aid as undermining Syrian sovereignty and reducing its chances of winning back control of the region. \u201cThe areas worst affected by the earthquake inside Syria look to be run by the Turkish-controlled opposition and not by the Syrian government,\u201d said Mark Lowcock, the former head of UN humanitarian affairs. \u201cIt is going to require Turkish acquiescence to get aid into those areas. It is unlikely the Syrian government will do much to help.\u201d It is hoped that the relatively sophisticated network of aid agencies that operate in Syria and southern Turkey means help can arrive relatively quickly. But the infrastructure of some of the aid groups themselves has been disrupted. The epicentre of the initial earthquake was near Gaziantep, where aid agencies including Syria Relief, the UK\u2019s largest Syria relief charity, have their offices. Video from a hospital posted by the Syrian American Medical Society (SAMS) on Monday showed it immensely crowded. The society said: \u201cOur hospitals are overwhelmed with patients filling the hallways. There is an immediate need for trauma supplies and a comprehensive emergency response to save lives and treat the injured.\u201d Initial needs are for tens of thousands tents, heaters for the tents, tens of thousands blankets, thermal clothes, ready-to-eat food and basic first aid kits. Rick Brennan, the World Health Organization\u2019s regional director of emergencies for the eastern Mediterranean, said the UN body would increase the number of its staff in Gaziantep and is looking at options for sending emergency medical teams to the region. \u201cI think we can expect the death toll to increase significantly,\u201d he said. Tanya Evans, the Syria country director for the International Rescue Committee, said: \u201cMany in north-west Syria have been displaced up to 20 times, and with health facilities strained beyond capacity even before this tragedy, many did not have access to the healthcare they critically need\u201d. She said the Syria humanitarian response plan for this year was already severely underfunded, with less than 50% of the required $4bn funded. The UK said it was sending 76 search and rescue specialists, four dogs and equipment to arrive in Turkey on Monday evening. An emergency medical team will also be sent to assess the situation on the ground. Ministers said they were in contact with the UN about the provision of emergency humanitarian support to those affected in Syria. Germany\u2019s Federal Agency for Technical Relief (THW) is preparing to deliver emergency generators, tents and blankets to Turkey. Emergency shelters and water treatment systems could also be provided, the German interior minister, Nancy Faeser, said. Greece, Israel, Egypt, Qatar and the UAE have also offered aid."

                    "body": "My friend Bill Russell, who has died aged 87, combined success in both football and teaching throughout his career. He was born in Hounslow, Middlesex (now the London borough of Hounslow), to Doris (nee Smith) and William Russell, a professional footballer and manager. Shortly afterwards, the family moved to north Wales, where William became manager of Rhyl United and Doris ran a boarding house. Bill went to Rhyl grammar school. As a result of his sporting and academic talents he was awarded one of only two national bursaries, which funded his degree in geography and German at University College Wales, Aberystwyth (now Aberystwyth University). He followed this with a one-year teacher training course at Loughborough College, Leicestershire (now Loughborough University), focusing on language teaching. Simultaneously with his university studies and afterwards, when he started teaching, Bill was a serious footballer and an athlete \u2013 he ran for Welsh Universities against Roger Bannister, then at the peak of his career, in 1954. Remaining an amateur allowed him freedom of movement between football clubs, including Bangor City, Rhyl and Manchester City reserves. In 1957 he scored the first goal, for Bishop Auckland, in the Amateur Cup final at Wembley in front of a crowd of 90,000, helping his team win the trophy. Soon afterwards he signed for Sheffield United and, over six seasons, made 175 appearances, scoring 75 goals and reaching the FA Cup semi-finals in 1961. He also won four England caps as an amateur. Alongside his football career, Bill pursued a parallel academic path, teaching languages at several schools around Manchester. After retiring from football in 1970, having also played for Bolton Wanderers, Rochdale, Scarborough and Chorley, he became head of languages at South Trafford Further Education College in Altrincham (now Trafford College). There, he met Cathie Cornish, who in 1994 became his second wife.  The following year he retired from teaching, but nearly 20 years later one of his former students contacted the \u201cthank you\u201d slot on Radio 4\u2019s Saturday Live programme to acknowledge how Bill\u2019s teaching had changed her life by helping her get into university. The fact that many old students kept in touch is another testament to his dedication. Bill returned to north Wales after his retirement, living in Dyserth, near Rhyl, where he was known for his hospitality. He then had more time to complete the Guardian\u2019s cryptic crossword every day and to add Welsh to his German and Russian, the Spanish and Italian he learned at evening classes, and self-taught Swedish.  Bill is survived by Cathie, his daughter, Mandy, from his first marriage, to Deirdre (nee Barnett), which ended in divorce, and by his grandchildren, Freddie and Max."

                    "body": "\n 2.00am  \nSummary\n\nOne of the greatest footballers to ever play the game \u2013 perhaps the greatest \u2013 has died.\nHere is our news report: \n\nAnd here is Richard Williams\u2019s long read on the great man.\n\n\n\n\n 2.00am  \n\nI\u2019m going to bring this blog to a close very soon. Beofre I go, here\u2019s an email from Ben Bagga.\n\nA boy, in Scotland, born in 1983, with no knowledge of Pel\u00e9, no elders to impart the genius or impact of the best, grew to enjoy playing football by an early age. My instinctive talent, many coaches/teammates exasperated by what I would (or try to) do, led me to believe that I didn\u2019t understand the game that I so enjoyed (I must add that I never played any higher than amateur level). I was given a video of numerous \u2018old\u2019 Brazil teams &amp; especially Pel\u00e9. Watching the instinctive skills of Pel\u00e9 showed me that football could be played in such a manner, that joy could be had (&amp; shown) within a successful football team. I realised I didn\u2019t just enjoy football, I loved it, I needed it. \nTonight I have shed more than a few tears, for the loss of someone I never knew or met, the loss of the greatest player of the game I love, the loss of an incomparable Brazilian icon &amp; more importantly the loss of an incredible person who showed, not only his family, but the world as a whole, an inconceivable amount of love &amp; joy. \n This is the first (&amp; I expect last) time that I cry due to the passing of someone not a friend or family member. Tonight my boys, (8 &amp; 4), learned of the passing of \u2018the greatest\u2019. If I have explained to them even half the reverence Pel\u00e9 had on my enjoyment, love (need) for football (the way \u2018he\u2019 played it) they will to an extent pass that on to their children.\nWith the greatest respect &amp; regret, Edison Arrantes do Nascimento has died. PELE IS ETERNAL.\n\n\n\n\n 1.46am  \n\nWhile today the tributes flow, it will not be long before Pel\u00e9\u2019s career is sliced and diced into oblivion as first-hand accounts of his greatness diminish and the fascination with anointing one true footballing deity consumes the game. Last year Barney Ronay cautioned against sidelining the Brazilian in this exercise in futility.\n\nPel\u00e9 did not have to exist. He was born as Brazilian sport was still struggling to overcome the colour bar. He played barefoot. He worked as a shoe-shiner and a vendor of stolen peanuts.\nWith nothing but talent to guide him, the boy from Minas Gerais became the first black global sporting superstar, and a source of genuine uplift and inspiration. Pel\u00e9 won the World Cup aged 17, moving like someone from the future, seeing different things, running through a different kind of air.\nThe idea he did this while somehow having it easy compared to the captive princelings of modern elite-tier football is just silly. But it is also self-defeating. The fact remains those Santos friendlies were what much of the Champions League is now, a treadmill, a way of monetising talent by showing it to the world.\nIs it harder to score a hat-trick against Atl\u00e9tico Madrid in a tour game in 1966, or against Viktoria Plzen in a hometown semi-dead rubber in 2011? Who knows. But they both definitely involve scoring a hat-trick.\nWhat is certain is that Pel\u00e9 invented this game, the idea of individual global sporting superstardom, and in a way that is unrepeatable now. Forget the giant cakes, the solid silver sombreros, the urge to sweep these icons aside. That part of him, core Pel\u00e9, is a gift to all of us. It will remain untouchable.\n\n\n\nUpdated at 1.52am GMT\n\n\n 1.35am  \n\n\nThe piece (from back in 2003) and the headline are both excellent, Simon. I especially enjoyed this paragraph. Today we mourn Edson; Pel\u00e9 is immortal.\n\nHe was born Edson Arantes do Nascimento, and often talks of Pele in the third person. It\u2019s as if they are two different people, and Edson is Pele\u2019s representative on earth, I say. \u201cYes, I feel like that. I used to go out and people said Pele! Pele! Pele! Pele! all over the world, but no one remembers Edson. Edson is the person who has the feelings, who has the family, who works hard, and Pele is the idol. Pele doesn\u2019t die. Pele will never die. Pele is going to go on for ever. But Edson is a normal person who is going to die one day, and the people forget that.\n\n\n\n\n\n 1.29am  \n\nNot unrelated to Pel\u00e9\u2019s relationship with African football was the colour of his skin. Here\u2019s Tom Phillips, The Guardian\u2019s Latin America correspondent:\n\n\n\n\n 1.24am  \n\nPel\u00e9\u2019s standing in African football seems destined to remain unchallenged. Although his oft-quoted premonition that: \u201cAn African nation will win the World Cup before the year 2000\u201d never came true, he championed football in the continent, with a succession of African stars taking his name in honour. \n\n\n\n\n 1.13am  \n\nThis particular tribute brought a lump to my throat. My own personal shorthand for footballing greatness has forever been Pel\u00e9, Maradona, and Cruyff. \n\nA good time to revisit Sad Steps by Philip Larkin. \n\n\n\n 1.06am  \n\nSuperb goal, extraordinary commentary. \n\n\n\n\n 1.01am  \n\nPel\u00e9\u2019s impact on the United States was profound, acting as a de facto ambassador for both Brazil and football. Presidents past and present have been sharing their memories. \n\n\n\n\n\n 12.57am  \n\nFans in New York have paid tribute to Pel\u00e9 who brought the curtain down on his career with a stint in the city playing for the fabled Cosmos. \u201cYou can say now to the world that soccer has finally arrived in the United States,\u201d he said when he signed his contract at the 21 Club before 200 photographers and press.\n\n\n\n\n 12.53am  \n\n\n\n\n\n 12.49am  \n\nContinuing from the previous post, Pel\u00e9 played his first match in England against Sheffield Wednesday at Hillsborough in 1962. A decade later Santos toured again, producing this memorable image:\n\nRemarkably, kick-off for this exhibition was 2.30pm on a Wednesday afternoon, a time chosen to avoid the disruption of floodlights not working during a miners strike. One can only guess at the level of truancy in South Yorkshire that day.\n\n\n\n\n 12.43am  \n\nAs well as surviving an era of uncompromising defending, Pel\u00e9 also played an absurd number of matches in a schedule that would make modern sports scientists faint. From the end of the 1950s to the early 1970s Pel\u00e9 was the star attraction of his club side Santos and their globetrotting money-making circus.\n\u201cWe were in demand,\u201d wrote Pel\u00e9 in his autobiography. \u201cThe suits were very keen to cash in.\u201d And cash in they did, but at some points their schedule was absolutely preposterous. For example, between the end of May and beginning of July 1959, they played 22 matches in eight countries around Europe, including encounters with Real Madrid, Barcelona, Hamburg, Feyenoord and Sporting. \u201cIt was ridiculous,\u201d wrote Pel\u00e9. \u201cThere was no time to relax; there was barely enough to travel from stadium to stadium.\u201d\nThat excerpt is taken from Nick Miller\u2019s story on Santos reaching England for the first time in 1962, a piece that contains further references to the ludicrous expectations heaped upon Pel\u00e9\u2019s shoulders.\n\nPel\u00e9 and his colleagues were basically being flogged silly by the Santos hierarchy, particularly when it became clear that he was going to leave when his contract expired in 1974. \u201cThe bird that laid the golden eggs was about to fly the coop,\u201d wrote Pel\u00e9, \u201cand they were really going to make him play, make him bank some money for the club \u2026 In an 18-month period we toured South America, the Caribbean, North America, Europe, Asia and Australia \u2026 Never in my life have I had my time so filled with airports, hotels and different countries. I had already played my 1,000th game for Santos, against Transvaal in Paramaribo, Surinam, and it seemed they were determined to get a few more hundred out of me before I went.\u201d \n\nHugh McIlvanney, writing in the Observer when Santos visited England in 1972, agreed:\n\nNow more than ever the justification for these profit-making excursions by Santos is the name of Pel\u00e9 \u2013 his name rather than his prowess, because he has no chance of displaying that adequately when he is being asked to play three or four games in as many countries in the same week. Pel\u00e9 is now as much an icon and an industry as he is a footballer \u2026 These tours have no more relevance to Pel\u00e9\u2019s reality as a great player than a jaunt round the American lecture circuit has to the work of a serious writer \u2026\nHe smiled and joked with those of us who had met him in Rio, Mexico and elsewhere and even when he spoke of the the impossible pressures of the tour his expression was wry rather than bitter. \u2018Too many planes, too much football,\u2019 he said. \u2018How can we play well?\u2019\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n 12.32am  \n\nInfantino\u2019s comment about Pel\u00e9 being kicked to shreds is not a throwaway remark. He played in an era where attackers were afforded far less protection from referees, as this clip attests.\n\nSimon Burnton has written about Pel\u00e9\u2019s brutal treatment at the 1966 World Cup, a tournament that proved a nadir in the Brazilian\u2019s international career. \n\nTheir best player, Pel\u00e9, was kicked so much in the first game against Bulgaria (\u201cI think every team will take care of him in the same manner,\u201d said their coach) that he could play no part in the second, a 3-1 defeat by Hungary when Brazil had two goals disallowed, and he then spent much of the third as a virtual spectator after Portugal\u2019s Jo\u00e3o Morais fouled him and, when he tried to get up and play on, fouled him again a bit harder. Morais was not cautioned. Brazil\u2019s first game had been refereed by a West German, the other two by Englishmen.\n\u201cWhen I first came back to Brazil after the World Cup games of 1966, my heart wasn\u2019t in playing football,\u201d Pel\u00e9 later said. \u201cThe games had been a revelation to me in their unsportsmanlike conduct and weak refereeing. England won the games that year but in my opinion she did not have the best team in the field.\u201d On another occasion he said that in 1966 \u201cfootball stopped being an art, stopped drawing the crowds by its skills, instead it became an actual war\u201d.\n\n\n\n\n\n 12.23am  \n\nThank you Michael, and I will begin by continuing the tribute from FIFA, who have distributed an official statement attributed to the organisation\u2019s president, Gianni Infantino, under the headline Pel\u00e9: Immortal - forever with us.\n\nFor everyone who loves the beautiful game, this is the day we never wanted to come. The day we lost Pel\u00e9.\n\u201cO Rei\u201d was unique in so many ways.\nHe was the only player to have won the FIFA World Cup three times and his skill and imagination were incomparable. Pel\u00e9 did things that no other player would even dream of, such as the famous dummy in the 1970 FIFA World Cup semi-final that became known as the \u201cPel\u00e9 run-around.\u201d Or the goal he scored in the 1958 FIFA World Cup final as a 17-year-old when he flicked the ball over a defender and volleyed it into the net.\nThe sight of him punching the air in celebration is one of the most iconic in our sport, and is etched into our history. In fact, because televised football was still in his infancy at the time, we only saw small glimpses of what he was capable of.\nMost importantly, \u201cThe King\u201d rose the throne with a smile on his face. Football could be brutal in those days, and Pel\u00e9 was often on the receiving end of some rough treatment. But, while he knew how to stand up for himself, he was always an exemplary sportsman, with genuine respect for his opponents.\nI had the great privilege of meeting him in several occasions. In 2016, already as FIFA President, we were side by side for the premiere of Pel\u00e9\u2019s movie, which reminded me of when I sat next to my father in 1981 when he brought me to watch \u201cEscape to Victory\u201d in which Pel\u00e9 starred alongside Silvester Stallone and other famous actors.\nI was 11 years old and my father told me what a great player Pel\u00e9 was. The fantastic goal he scored in that movie was the only way, at that time, to have a glimpse of his incredible skills.\nThe moments spent with him will forever remain in my memory and in my heart.\nPel\u00e9 had a magnetic presence and, when you were with him, the rest of the world stopped.\nHis life is about more than football. He changed perceptions for the better in Brazil, in South America and across the world.\nHis legacy is impossible to summarise in words.\nTo his family and friends, to CBF, to Brazil and to all football fans who loved him so much, I express my sincere condolences.\nToday, we all mourn the loss of the physical presence of our dear Pel\u00e9, but he achieved immortality a long time ago and therefore he will be with us for eternity.\n\n\n\n\n 12.18am  \n\nTime is getting on here in the UK, so going to hand over to Jonathan Howcroft in Australia, who will continue to bring you the best updates, tributes and reaction to Pel\u00e9\u2019s death. I just want to say what a privilege it\u2019s been to be working tonight. \nDo send any thoughts or memories to Jonathan via email, or by tweeting @JPHowcroft. \n\n\n\n\n 12.02am  \n\nThis is the Guardian\u2019s front page in the UK tomorrow. \n\n\n\n\n 11.56pm  \n\nI preferred Ossie Ardiles\u2019s tribute, but each to their own. \n\n\n\n\n 11.34pm  \n\nOssie Ardiles, World Cup winner with Argentina and co-star in Escape to Victory, has his say:\n\nWhile we\u2019re here \u2026 oh go on then. Michael Caine and Pel\u00e9? Delicious.\n\nIf you haven\u2019t seen Escape to Victory, I implore you to watch it. An irresistable mix of good v evil, football, Bobby Moore and Sylvester Stallone (among others).\n\nFor those that have watched it, you might enjoy this David Squires cartoon.\n\n\nUpdated at 11.39pm GMT\n\n\n 11.13pm  \n\nSometimes, less is more. \n\n\n\n\n 11.12pm  \n\nAmazing to think about how rapidly the world changed over Pel\u00e9\u2019s career. Being a young man in the eye of that storm must have been a seismic undertaking. In 1958, days after winning the World Cup, he had to radio his father to tell him he had won the World Cup. By 1970, his third World Cup triumph was transmitted to the globe by colour TV. \nThis is an email from Darryl Accone, in Johannesburg.\n\nSouth Africa introduced television only in the mid-1970s, so it was as a 10-year-old that I listened to the 1970 World Cup Final with my parents, grandparents, uncles, aunts and cousins at my grandparents\u2019 home. On my grandfather\u2019s splendid old radio/ gramophone player we were tuned in to the BBC\u2019s commentary, and the litany of Brazilian names rings in my ears till today: Pel\u00e9, Rivelino, G\u00e9rson, Jairzinho, Tost\u00e3o, Carlos Alberto (that goal!). As tributes to Pel\u00e9 emphasise, he brought love and togetherness to football, family and people - one of whom remembers as if it were today those few hours when a game in Mexico was played out on the sunny porch of a home in Johannesburg, and Pel\u00e9 won imperishable fame, adulation and respect.\nTo the King, from South Africa with love.\n\n\n\n\n 11.08pm  \n\nThe gallery also features a striking image of Pel\u00e9 with his father, Dondinho, around the family dinner table. Pel\u00e9 was just nine years old when Brazil lost the 1950 World Cup Final to Uruguay. \n\u201cIt was the first time I ever saw my father cry, and all because of that defeat,\u201d he told Fifa in 2014. \u201cI remember saying to him: \u2018Don\u2019t cry, Papa. I\u2019ll win the World Cup for you.\u2019\u201d\nEight years later, as a 17-year-old, he achieved that dream. Even the Swedish players were in awe. \u201cAfter the fifth goal I didn\u2019t want to mark Pel\u00e9 any more. I wanted to applaud him,\u201d said midfielder Sigge Parling.\n\u201cMy first thoughts were about my family,\u201d Pel\u00e9 wrote in his autobiography. \u201cDid they know that we were champions? I wanted to speak to my parents but there were no telephones, so I kept on saying, \u2018I\u2019ve got to tell my dad, I\u2019ve got to tell my dad.\u2019\n\u201cI only managed to speak to him in the following days, using an international radio. I can remember saying things like: \u2018Did you see me with the Swedish king? Over,\u2019 and \u201cI shook the king\u2019s hand. Over.\u2019 \u201d\nWhen the pair were reunited, Pele recalled: \u201cI saw my father cry again... this time with happiness.\u201d\n\n\n\n 10.55pm  \n\nI am biased, of course, but I do believe this is the greatest gallery of Pel\u00e9 on the internet. Has a bit of everything: World Cup glory, quiet family moments, being stuck in a traffic jam in Bolton, and even a portrait from our own photographer, Tom Jenkins. Enjoy.\n\n\nUpdated at 11.01pm GMT\n\n\n 10.53pm  \n\nRegarding that Bobby Moore quote, I\u2019ve received this email from George Evanko. Turns out Pel\u00e9 did actually play in goal, as well. \n\nI believe I have a somewhat unique memory of Pel\u00e9. In 1973, his Santos club played a friendly in my hometown of Baltimore against a local pro team, the Bays. As you might expect, it was a hopeless mismatch, which Santos won, 4-0. I remember thinking that Pel\u00e9 wasn\u2019t doing anything special and, in the end, he had scored two goals, one on a corner kick. He made it look effortless. \nI have to be one of the few people who can say I saw him play goalie! He did so for the final few minutes, when their keeper went down with an injury. \nFor confirmation of this, I found an Associated Press story from that date:\nClaudia, the substitute goal keeper for Santos, was injured with nine minutes, 36 seconds remaining. The regular goalie, Cejas, went back to Brazil after being injured in a game against the Bays last Friday, so Pel\u00e9 took over the duties for the remainder of the game.\n\n\n\n\n 10.49pm  \n\nI\u2019ve nicked some (old) quotes from this excellent Antique Football thread on Twitter.\n\u201cPel\u00e9 is one of the few who contradicted my theory. Instead of 15 minutes of fame, he will have 15 centuries.\u201d \u2013 Andy Warhol.\n\u201cI told myself before the game, \u2018He\u2019s made of skin and bones just like everyone else\u2019. But I was wrong.\u201d \u2013 Tarcisio Burgnich, the Italy defender who marked Pel\u00e9 in the 1970 World Cup Final.\n\n\u201cAbsolutely everybody wanted to shake his hand, to get a photo with him. Saying you had partied with Pel\u00e9 was the biggest badge of honour going.\u201d - Mick Jagger.\n\u201cPel\u00e9 was the most complete player I\u2019ve ever seen, he had everything ... I remember Saldanha the coach being asked by a Brazilian journalist who was the best goalkeeper in his squad. He said Pel\u00e9. The man could play in any position.\u201d- Bobby Moore.\nI\u2019ll end with this from Shep Messing, who was a goalkeeper with the New York Cosmos. If there is not a meeting tomorrow at Vogue about commissioning a long read into Pel\u00e9\u2019s threads in the 1970s (specifically lapels) then I am putting my hand up to write it.\n\n\nUpdated at 11.09pm GMT\n\n\n 10.28pm  \n\nNo liveblog from the Guardian would be complete without an update or two from Manchester. Here\u2019s Sir Bobby Charlton with a few words: \n\u201cPel\u00e9 was a truly magical footballer and a wonderful human being. It was an honour to have shared a pitch with him and I send my sincerest condolences to his family, friends and the Brazilian people.\u201d\nCharlton\u2019s former Manchester United teammate Denis Law added: \u201cThis is very sad news indeed. Pel\u00e9 was an \u00adunbelievable footballer; he had style, grace, flair and made everything look so easy. The precision in the way he played made him such a joy to watch. However, more than anything, he was a good man with a great \u00adpresence and a fantastic smile.\u201d\n\n\n\n 10.14pm  \n\nGreat detail from Alex Bellos, who wrote one of Pel\u00e9 autobiographies. We\u2019ll have a nice piece from Alex on Friday about Pel\u00e9\u2019s complicated relationship with Brazil, on and off the field.\n\n\n\nUpdated at 10.16pm GMT\n\n\n 10.11pm  \n\nSaturday/Sunday: NYE party.\nSunday: Lula\u2019s inauguration.\nMonday: Pel\u00e9\u2019s wake.\nGood luck to anyone out there in Brazil doing the early work shift on Tuesday.\n\n\nUpdated at 10.17pm GMT\n\n\n 9.58pm  \n\nMore reaction from around the grounds \u2026\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 9.45pm  \n\nFrom that moment, a friendship between Pel\u00e9 and Banks was born. The Brazilian led the tributes to the Englishman when he died in 2019:\n\nI scored many goals in my life but people always like to ask about the one I didn\u2019t score, because of that save. While it was indeed phenomenal my memory of Gordon is not defined by that but his friendship. He was a kind, warm man who gave so much to people. I am glad he saved my header because it was the start of a friendship I will always treasure. Whenever we met it was like we had never been apart.\u201d\n\n\nUpdated at 10.17pm GMT\n\n\n 9.42pm  \n\nPel\u00e9 was known for his preposterous goal record but two of the biggest moments that come to mind were two near misses at the 1970 World Cup. Or rather, one miss and one save (from England\u2019s Gordon Banks). Two pieces of absolute genius, whichever way you look at them.\nThis dummy against Uruguay in the semi-final.\n\nAnd this, against England, in the group stage. Pel\u00e9 actually shouted \u201cgoal!\u201d before realising that Banks had actually saved his header.\n\n\nUpdated at 9.50pm GMT\n\n\n 9.28pm  \n\nMore tributes are coming in from both former teammates and opponents.\nFranz Beckenbauer, Germany legend and now Bayern Munich\u2019s honorary president, wrote: \u201cToday, football lost the greatest man in its history \u2013 and I lost a unique friend. Born in Tr\u00eas Cora\u00e7\u00f5es, Pel\u00e9 had three hearts: for football, for his family and for all people. Someone who played with the stars and always stayed down to earth.\n\u201cI went to the US in 1977 because I really wanted to play on a team with Pel\u00e9 at New York Cosmos. This time at his side was one of the greatest experiences of my career. We became champions together right away, and Pel\u00e9 then just called me his brother. It was an unimaginable honour for me. Football will always belong to you! You will always be here. Thank you for your game, O Rei!\u201d\nSir Geoff Hurst, who won the World Cup in 1966 with England and also played in the 1-0 defeat to Brazil at the 1970 World Cup, had this to say:\n\n\nUpdated at 9.33pm GMT\n\n\n 9.22pm  \n\nSantos, the club Pel\u00e9 played at for almost the entirety of his club career, have posted this.\n\nSantos were a relatively small club when Pel\u00e9 came through the team. In the late 1950s, with the world\u2019s biggest star in their ranks, Santos realised they had a method of printing money by sending the squad out on the road. And, for the next decade, they sent them to every corner of the globe.\n\n\n\nUpdated at 12.49am GMT\n\n\n 9.15pm  \n\nThis is the current scene outside the Albert Einstein hospital in S\u00e3o Paulo, as police, fans and news teams scramble for positions. \n\n\n\n\n 9.12pm  \nKey event\n\nFor Brazil, this is a death of a historic figure on a scale similar to that of Queen Elizabeth II in Britain. All the major news channels and web portals immediately switched to wall-to-wall \u2013 often white-on-black-headlined - coverage of his death and legacy.\n\u201cAdeus, Pel\u00e9! Brazil bids farewell to the greatest footballer in history\u201d noted a sombre yet celebratory lead story on the UOL site, which described him as not just a footballer but the most important icon in the country\u2019s history.\n\u201cThe death of Pel\u00e9: the King of Football\u201d ran the headline of Brazil\u2019s most popular news site, Globo, which foregrounded a gallery showing the football-loving child in a poor backwater rising to win three World Cups and standing shoulder to shoulder with Queen Elizabeth and Nelson Mandela.\nOutgoing president Jair Bolsonaro was initially silent amid rumours about whether he will leave the country before the transfer of power on 1 January. Others quoted Neymar\u2019s post: \u201cPel\u00e9 changed everything. He transformed football into an art.\u201d\nAs usual, the legendary football writer Juca Kfouri put it best in a touching personal reminiscence for Folha: \u201cPel\u00e9 kicked magnificently with both feet, headed with his eyes open, scored goals like no one else, made passes that surprised even his teammates, killed the ball on his chest as if he were cradling it like a baby in his arms.\u201d\n\nUpdated at 9.27pm GMT\n\n\n 9.04pm  \n\nOf course, football is a global game \u2013 the most global game \u2013 and Pel\u00e9 didn\u2019t need to be playing in front of you to be your hero. Here\u2019s another excellent email from Zaven Aharonian, who grew up in Yerevan, Armenia in the 1960s, when it was part of the Soviet Union.\n\nI\u2019m 64 now. I have been living this game since I was five. We did not see them, until 1970, but all the boys kicking the ball on asphalt or on dusty turf of our growing city wanted to be like those guys whose pictures we saw on the walls of a small booth of the shoemaker down the street, a lucky guy who somehow got them from foreign visitors \u2013 Pel\u00e9, Garrincha, Didi, Vava\u2026.\nPel\u00e9 was the best, the brightest, who made the football and entertainment a show. Every kid wanted to be like him. Learning the tricks, the dribbles the shots from scarce tv clips. Brazil friendly with USSR in Moscow in 1965 was No 1 event of the summer \u2026 and finally 1970, in colour, it was a revelation to see that Brazil team, arguably the best in World Cup history, with Pel\u00e9 as a Crown Jewel part of unforgettable magnificent five \u2013 Pel\u00e9, Tost\u00e3o, Jairzinho, G\u00e9rson, Rivellino.\nHe taught me how to play intelligent football \u2013 as Cruyff formulated later, \u201cyou play it with your head and help with your feet\u201d. Pel\u00e9 was the first who did it. His intelligence, with his physical and technical prowess, made him the first and the only King of football.\nHe is eternity now.He was the first and best.Thank you for your game you made an art.\u201d\n\n\nUpdated at 9.08pm GMT\n\n\n 8.55pm  \n\nFittingly, this is an email I have just received from Ken Brucker in San Diego.\n\nPel\u00e9 was a member of the first visiting soccer team I ever went to see play in a professional match. He and Franz Beckenbauer are the only members of the New York Cosmos whose names I remember right off hand. At six or seven years of age, I really didn\u2019t have any idea about how special this match was. Some kids growing up wanted to be like Mike (Michael Jordan). When I tried playing soccer, I wanted to be Pel\u00e9.\u201d\nHa! Imagine going to your first game, and it\u2019s Pel\u00e9 and Beckenbauer strutting their stuff. Reminds me of the first season I supported Blackburn Rovers, and we won the Premier League. It can only be downhill from there.\n\n\nUpdated at 9.09pm GMT\n\n\n 8.51pm  \n\nBarack Obama is the latest to pay tribute.\n\nPel\u00e9\u2019s legacy on football (or soccer, of course) in the US should not be underestimated. He signed for the New York Cosmos in the twilight of his career and transformed the league there. Here is some nice detail from the Guardian\u2019s obituary.\n\nHe played his last game for the club in October 1974 but, with financial clouds still hanging over him, he came out of retirement a few months later after receiving an offer he simply could not refuse. To the astonishment of football fans, particularly in Brazil, he went to play for New York Cosmos in the fledgling North American Soccer League (NASL). They would pay him $7m for three years as a player, plus another three as a \u201cgoodwill ambassador\u201d.\nAs well as a salary that would make him the highest-paid sportsman in the world, he was also tempted by the offer of a new challenge laid down by the Cosmos manager, Clive Toye, perhaps one that suited a footballer past his peak: \u201cI told him don\u2019t go to Italy, don\u2019t go to Spain, all you can do is win a championship. Come to the US and you can win a country.\u201d\nAnd so it proved: Pel\u00e9 and the Cosmos were a perfect fit. The astonishing skill that had beguiled football fans in almost every country in the world was a revelation to a new American audience, and he loved the razzmatazz of the NASL \u2013 his easy charm was a gift to sports marketing men who were selling, in effect, a brand new product.\nOver three seasons he scored 65 goals in 111 games for the Cosmos, and led them to the 1977 American championship. The team became a huge commercial presence and regularly sold out their 60,000-seater stadium \u2013 unthinkable before his arrival. His last game came in October 1977, an exhibition match in New York between his two clubs, Santos and Cosmos, broadcast to dozens of countries, in which he played one half for each side, and scored his last goal, his 1,283rd in 1,367 games. Those figures are remarkable in themselves, but the fact that more than 500 of those games were friendlies played all over the world is testament to his popularity and box office appeal.\n\n\nUpdated at 8.57pm GMT\n\n\n 8.40pm  \nFrom Tom Phillips, our Latin America correspondent\n\nPel\u00e9\u2019s death has sparked a huge outpouring of emotion in his native Brazil, with politicians, celebrities and sporting icons uniting to celebrate Brazil\u2019s departed king.\nThe Brazilian government led the tributes tweeting: \u201cFootball perfection; the King was almost synonymous with his homeland. Generations to come will remember him as a gentleman off the field, and a magician on it\u201d.\nBrazil\u2019s incoming president, Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, said he believed Pel\u00e9 would join a heavenly kickabout with football greats such as Garrincha, Socrates and Maradona.\n\u201cFew Brazilians carried our country\u2019s name so far,\u201d Lula tweeted. \u201cHowever different their language was to Portuguese, foreigners from all over the planet always found a way of pronouncing the magic word: \u2018Pel\u00e9\u2019\u201d\n\u201cThank you Pel\u00e9 for all the happiness you gave us!\u201d tweeted the samba star Zeca Pagodinho.\nPel\u00e9\u2019s former club Santos tweeted an image of a crown alongside a single word: \u201cEternal\u201d.\nThe mayor of Rio, Eduardo Paes, described Pel\u00e9 as an everlasting football icon and a unique ambassador for Brazil on the world stage. \u201cThe genius and talent of the planet\u2019s most popular King of Sport will enchant and inspire generations to come,\u201d Paes wrote.\n\u201cThank you, Pel\u00e9! Thank you for the smiles you gave us. For the tears of emotion. For the cheers of goal Thank you for the happiness you gave the Brazilian people and the people of the world. Never was there such a beloved king,\u201d wrote the former president Dilma Rousseff.\nBrazil\u2019s new culture minister, the singer Margareth Menezes, said her country had lost \u201cthe greatest player in history\u201d.\nBrazil\u2019s most famous football commentator Galv\u00e3o Bueno tweeted: \u201cMy friend \u00c9dson has gone!! ... But not Pel\u00e9!! Pel\u00e9 is eternal!!\u201d\n\nUpdated at 8.43pm GMT\n\n\n 8.37pm  \n\nSpeaking of tributes, here are two significant messages. Lionel Messi leads with a very simple message \u2013 \u201cRest in peace\u201d \u2013 while Cristiano Ronaldo has posted:\n\nMy deepest condolences to all of Brazil, and in particular to the family of Mr. Edson Arantes do Nascimento. A mere \u201cgoodbye\u201d to the eternal King Pel\u00e9 will never be enough to express the pain that currently embraces the entire world of football. An inspiration for so many millions, a reference from yesterday, today, forever.\nThe affection he always showed for me was reciprocal in every moment we shared, even from a distance. He will never be forgotten and his memory will live on forever in each of us football lovers. Rest in peace, King Pel\u00e9.\u201d\n\n\n\nUpdated at 8.37pm GMT\n\n\n 8.28pm  \n\nThis made me smile. When Maradona died in 2020, Pel\u00e9 was one of the first to pay tribute: \u201cOne day, I hope we can play football together in the sky\u201d. \n\n\nUpdated at 8.30pm GMT\n\n\n 8.26pm  \n\nA few emails are trickling through from readers.\n\u201cI was fortunate to see the 1958 World Cup final, live on television, and it is still to this day the most extraordinary game I have ever seen, and Pel\u00e9 was at the heart of it,\u201d Peter Rist writes. \u201cI couldn\u2019t believe the things that were done by the Brazilian players, especially Pel\u00e9 \u2013 how he was able to control the ball with his feet, legs, shoulders and head. And, having won three World Cups, He is surely the real GOAT \u2013 and a wonderful human being, to boot.\u201d\nIt\u2019s worth remembering that HE WAS JUST 17 when he won football\u2019s greatest prize for the first time. Imagine that: 17. He scored twice in the final against Sweden, a remarkable 5-2 victory. Here is the Guardian\u2019s report from 1958, courtesy of WR Taylor.\n\n\nUpdated at 8.33pm GMT\n\n\n 8.17pm  \n\nThe GOAT (greatest of all time) debate is a tiresome, futile exercise, but it has reignited over recent years with the exploits of Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo. Different players in different eras can never truly be compared: the standard of opponents, training, pitches and even equipment (balls, boots) have completely transformed the sport. Pel\u00e9, Maradona and Messi should be seen only in the context of their own time.\nPel\u00e9\u2019s legacy looms large over all who have followed him. Maradona, Cruyff, Iniesta, Zidane, Messi, CR7 have all borrowed something from his wheelhouse. The video below is evidence of that. Everyone should bow down to The King.\n\n\nUpdated at 8.19pm GMT\n\n\n 8.05pm  \nThe Guardian's obituary\n\n\n(features a sensational photo of him at the 1981 Cannes Film Festival!)\n\n\n\n 8.02pm  \n\nIt is worth remembering that Neymar equalled Pel\u00e9\u2019s scoring record for Brazil at the World Cup. Both players have 77 goals for their country.\n\nUpdated at 8.03pm GMT\n\n\n 7.58pm  \n\nNeymar, the player who now wears the Brazil No 10 shirt made famous by Pel\u00e9, posted on Instagram:\n\nBefore Pel\u00e9, \u201c10\u201d was just a number. I\u2019ve read this phrase somewhere, at some point in my life. But this sentence, beautiful, is incomplete. I would say before Pel\u00e9 football was just a sport. Pel\u00e9 has changed it all. He turned football into art, into entertainment He gave voice to the poor, to the blacks and especially: He gave visibility to Brazil. Soccer and Brazil have raised their status thanks to the King! He\u2019s gone but his magic remains. Pel\u00e9 is FOREVER!!\n\n\n\nUpdated at 8.01pm GMT\n\n\n 7.53pm  \n\nThe emergence of the teenaged Pel\u00e9 during the 1958 World Cup opened a door to a new dimension of football. The brief televised highlights of the matches in Sweden were broadcast in a black and white that was actually more like blurred shades of grey but already the Brazilian prodigy seemed to be sharply focused and bathed in a golden glow.\nThe skinny 17-year-old with the flat-top haircut scored six goals, several of them executed with an impudent wit and a hitherto unimaginable level of technique, and then wept openly on the shoulder of Gilmar, the team\u2019s goalkeeper, when the triumph was secured. For many of his new fans in foreign lands, Edson Arantes do Nascimento was the first complicated foreign name they committed to memory.\nTwelve years after that first eruption of genius he won his third World Cup winner\u2019s medal. The 1970 tournament was watched by many viewers on colour television sets, a high proportion of them purchased specially for the occasion. Football has never seemed as splendid as when Pel\u00e9 \u2013 now a mature man of 29 \u2013 was at the heart of a team including Tost\u00e3o, Jairzinho, G\u00e9rson, Roberto Rivellino and Carlos Alberto, an ensemble of masters surrounded by their own golden aura as they took the game to a new level of creative interplay, with the No 10 as their conductor.\nRead the full tribute here:\n\n\nUpdated at 7.53pm GMT\n\n\n 7.46pm  \n\n\n\n\n\n 7.45pm  \n\nFrance\u2019s Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 called Pel\u00e9 the \u201cking of football\u201d in a social media post.\n\n\nUpdated at 7.52pm GMT\n\n\n 7.45pm  \n\nAnother England footballer, Sir Geoff Hurst, said he was \u201cproud\u201d to have shared a pitch with him.\n\n\n\n\n 7.39pm  \n\nFormer England footballer Gary Lineker has posted on Twitter paying tribute to the \u201cdivine\u201d Pel\u00e9.\n\n\nUpdated at 7.51pm GMT\n\n\n 7.35pm  \n\nA hospital statement read: \u201cThe Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein regretfully confirms the death of Edson Arantes do Nascimento, Pele, today, December 29, 2022, at 3:27 pm, due to the failure of multiple organs, a result of the progression of cancer of colon associated with his previous clinical condition.\n\u201cHospital Israelita Albert Einstein sympathizes with the family and everyone who suffers from the loss of our dear King of Football.\u201d\n\n\n\n 7.35pm  \n\nA statement on Pele\u2019s official Instagram account said: \u201cInspiration and love marked the journey of King Pele, who peacefully passed away today.\n\u201cOn his journey, Edson enchanted the world with his genius in sport, stopped a war, carried out social works all over the world and spread what he most believed to be the cure for all our problems: love.\n\u201cHis message today becomes a legacy for future generations. Love, love and love, forever.\u201d\n\n\nUpdated at 7.38pm GMT\n\n\n 7.22pm  \nPel\u00e9 has died\n\nOne of the greatest footballers to ever play the game \u2013 perhaps the greatest \u2013 has died.\nHere is our news report:\n\nAnd here is Richard Williams\u2019s long read on the great man. \n\n\nUpdated at 7.23pm GMT\n"

                    "body": "  9.35pm    So that is all from us this evening, thank you for joining us for yet another astonishing England win. Four goals from Mead, a hat-trick from Toone and goals from White and Stanway continues England\u2019s fantastic run in the World Cup qualifiers. If you want to re-live any of the action or have a recap, read Suzy Wrack\u2019s report here.     9.33pm    Thank you for all your contributions this evening, it was great to know it\u2019s not just me who has a clumsy five minutes! My carpet is almost dry (four hours later!) and there appears to be no stain. I credit my blotting skills. Were they as impressive as England\u2019s 10-0 win? Maybe, just maybe.     9.30pm    England manager Sarina Wiegman has confirmed in her post-match press conference that Beth England and Niamh Charles have tested negative. They will both be in contention for Tuesday\u2019s qualifier. It\u2019s thought captain Leah Williamson will also be fit for the fixture. No update so far on Alex Greenwood and Lotte Wubben-Moy who picked up injury worries ahead of this match.     9.25pm    So are England contenders for the Euros title? They definitely are but they\u2019ll have fierce competition, namely in the Netherlands, Spain and Sweden. Of course Sarina Wiegman\u2019s team have the home advantage but it will be a difficult task for them and all countries involved to get their hands on the trophy.     9.20pm    What a night for Ellen White, surpassing Harry Kane and Bobby Charlton in the all-time England scorers. She is in touching distance of eclipsing Wayne Rooney\u2019s record of 53 goals. Will she break it on Tuesday against Northern Ireland? If she doesn\u2019t she will have ample opportunity this summer with three friendlies and then the Euros. Rooney is now the only other player to reach 50 goals for England. Such an amazing achievement for the Manchester City star.      9.15pm    England manager Sarina Wiegman told ITV: \u201cAn opponent that compared to us isn\u2019t great but we have make the game. We have to speed up the game. That\u2019s what we tried to do. We scored 10 goals which is nice. \u201cIt\u2019s hard. We created lots of chances and sometimes we should have been more patient.\u201d     9.10pm    This isn\u2019t the end of England\u2019s international spell as they will play Northern Ireland on Tuesday. There could be more squad rotation in that match too with the likes of Beth England and Niamh Charles potentially being available. Will they go for consistency or experimentation? With a more difficult side on Tuesday you\u2019d think Wiegman would put out her strongest side.     9.06pm    Ellen White told ITV after scoring 50 England goals: \u201cI think it\u2019s pleasing to score. The overall performance, the standard is remaining really high. We wanted those three points. \u201cIt\u2019s a massive privilege [to be among Harry Kane and Wayne Rooney]. It\u2019s a dream for me to play for England. For me it\u2019s any way I can contribute to the team... It\u2019s an incredible feeling to be among those amazing players.\u201d     9.02pm    A player who was impressive when she came on was Nikita Parris. She was causing all sorts of trouble for the defence and she secured a lot of free kicks. The only thing she was missing was a goal which she would have had if she wasn\u2019t offside. It will be interesting to see if she gets a starting shirt for their qualifier against Northern Ireland on Tuesday.     8.56pm   Full-time: North Macedonia 0-10 England  England continue their flawless run in these World Cup qualifiers as they keep another clean sheet. Beth Mead got four, Ella Toone scored a hat-trick with Ellen White and Georgia Stanway also among the scorers. It was a dominant performance with almost 40 shots at goal but there were scores which should have been converted by the visitors. But a win is a win and another three points sees them stay top of Group D.  Updated at 8.58pm BST    8.53pm    90 + 3 min: England build from deep on their pursuit of number 11 and it makes its way to Panchurova, who smothers the ball. Carter sends the ball to Toone and it pings around the box. Zelem gets a shot away but it sails over the bar.  It may be staying 10-0 here, with goals definitely left out on the pitch by England.     8.50pm    90 + 1 min: Markovska is now booked, the fifth yellow for the hosts this evening! There will be five minutes added and so England could find another here, they definitely have the time.      8.49pm    89 min: Velkova is back to her feet after a lengthy break and will stay on the pitch. And while it may be late in this match England continue to fish for another goal.     8.47pm    87 min: Russo almost scores again but the keeper makes a great save after a defensive blunder saw England pounce. The Lionesses remain relentless and keep hammering North Macedonia\u2019s door. The latest chance ends in a goal kick. Velkova is now down with injury. I can imagine there will be a good few added minutes.     8.44pm    84 min: Parris is chopped down on the edge of the box with Velkova getting a yellow card. The Arsenal player has been clinical since coming on. Carter takes the kick but can\u2019t find anyone in the box. England still in possession and building once again. Parris looked as though she had scored but she was offside!     8.42pm    82 min: Russo almost gets among the scoring action but Panchurova collects well. There\u2019s a break in play as Boseska is on the ground after helping to defend that Russo shot.     8.40pm    80 min: I predicted 10-0 before kick-off but I think there are a few more to come. The Lionesses record away win is 13-0 and I could see them at least equalling it here as North Macedonia tire. England have another free kick and they are building from halfway. North Macedonia make a change as Petrushevska comes on for Nikolovska.     8.38pm   GOAL! North Macedonia 0-10 England (Toone, 77')  Now Toone gets among the hat-trick action. It was too easy as Parris makes an open run into the box and it\u2019s passed back to Toone who slices it.   Updated at 8.46pm BST    8.36pm    76 min: Salihi has been given a yellow card for a foul on Mead and England immediately launch an attack. It\u2019s hard to find new words to describe the Lionesses brutal forward play.  Parris has earned them a free kick just outside the box but it\u2019s well blocked by North Macedonia. Huge 62 goals across seven games in these qualifiers. A staggering statistic.     8.34pm   GOAL! North Macedonia 0-9 England (Toone, 73')  The ball pin balls around the box with Russo doing so well to keep it in play. Toone finds her second as she is unmarked in the box. Just as a say there\u2019s a lull, there\u2019s a goal!     8.33pm    73 min: Mead and Stokes link up in the box but the hosts manage to close down the attack. Parris gets a cross in the hope of finding Scott but her long legs go a bit high and possession is given away. There\u2019s definitely been a lull in this game in the last ten minutes but England will be encouraged as they still haven\u2019t conceded in the World Cup qualifiers.     8.30pm    70 min: North Macedonia have a free kick and they force Hampton into a catch. The most the keeper has been threatened this evening. England make a triple change as Russo, Zelem and Daly coming on for Walsh, Bronze and White. White will have to wait to equal Rooney\u2019s record but she has reached 50 goals for her country this evening. Just to give an update on my carpet stain, for those interested haha, it seems to be clearing up. Thank goodness! My clumsy moment hasn\u2019t led to permanent damage.     8.27pm    67 min: An England corner sees Mead take up the set-piece duties. Bronze got a touch to it and she just can\u2019t get the header on target. If the visitors capitalised on all their chances the scoreline would be even more punishing for North Macedonia.     8.25pm    65 min: Bronze\u2019s cross has too much on it and England\u2019s attack stalls. But once more they are easily back in possession in seconds. Parris tries to get a cross in but it\u2019s well blocked. Mead does get a cross in with her getting a slick pass across goal with it just evading White.     8.23pm    63 min: You won\u2019t be surprised as I tell you the Lionesses are continuing their onslaught of attack. North Macedonia must be so tired at this point, England have had 28 shots at goal. And there\u2019s no sign of them stopping any time soon with Parris attempting to score but it goes just wide.     8.20pm    60 min: England make their first changes as Parris and Scott come on for Hemp and Stanway. Hemp has been great with multiple assists and Stanway has slotted two goals.  Updated at 8.21pm BST    8.18pm    58 min: This is a mirror of the start of the game, the first three goals were scored early doors and then England let up slightly. Can the Lionesses keep up this pressure? England again on the attack but White clashes with Panchurova and North Macedonia get the free kick.     8.16pm   GOAL! North Macedonia 0-8 England (Stanway, 55')  Okay I am struggling to keep up! Another great cross from Hemp sees Stanway put her second of the match away. She turned and smashes home, wow!   Updated at 8.32pm BST    8.15pm    55 min: North Macedonia are making changes with Rochi and Petrovska make way for Salihi and Stojkovska. England running up to goal once again in search of their eighth.     8.13pm   GOAL! North Macedonia 0-7 England (Mead, 52')  Oh that slice was perfect as Hemp\u2019s attempt is saved and Mead pounces for her fourth. One more goal would equal an England record for the most goals in a single game.   Updated at 8.23pm BST    8.12pm    52 min: Wow, so so close! Bronze gets a shot away and White flies through the air to try and get a head to it but she just misses. I have received a few messages about these matches being a waste of time due to the scoreline. A lot of people are discussing whether the World Cup qualifiers need to be adapted to avoid these huge scores but for now it\u2019s the route to the world stage.     8.10pm    50 min: Panchurova is down injured, she looks in pain and is crying on the floor. Let\u2019s hope that\u2019s not as bad as it looks. She\u2019s receiving treatment and looks to be staying on the pitch.     8.08pm    48 min: Stanway tries to get a long-range shot away but it\u2019s deflected for a corner. Hemp takes the kick, a set-piece taker change with Stanway taking them in the first half, with White getting a head to it. It\u2019s cleared on the line but a foul goes against England.     8.07pm   GOAL! North Macedonia 0-6 England (Mead, 46')  And there\u2019s the hat-trick for Mead! A great hit into the corner sees the first goal of the second half. No changes for England at half-time but the hosts have with Mustafa off for Shemsovikj.   Updated at 8.19pm BST    8.05pm    And we\u2019re back underway!  It\u2019s worth noting there are 124 places between these teams in the world rankings. In terms of the fan question I was asked earlier, my colleagues are unsure as to why there aren\u2019t many supporters in the stadium. So I am presuming it isn\u2019t Covid related. But I may be wrong. If I hear anything concrete I\u2019ll let you know.     7.52pm    Did you know The Guardian has a women\u2019s football newsletter called Moving the Goalposts?

Great contributors like Suzy Wrack, J\u00falia Belas and Sophie Downey bring you all the major stories happening in the sport and sum up the big talking points.  Click here to sign up so it drops right into your inbox!       7.50pm   Half-time: North Macedonia 0-5 England  Well, what a half that was! North Macedonia haven\u2019t been able to stop the relentless England attack. Mead has had two goals with Toone, White and Stanway getting amongst the action. How many more goals will we see? Huge 45 coming up.     7.49pm    45 + 3 min: It was three added minutes and so half-time is looming. North Macedonia have a free kick but Toone collects the ball well. Rochi is getting frustrated and she has started to have words with the ref. She needs to be careful as she is on a yellow.     7.47pm    45 +1 min: I have missed how many minutes have been added but play continues. England, you guessed it, are still attacking. The peddle is not letting up with Hemp\u2019s chance the latest.     7.45pm   GOAL! North Macedonia 0-5 England (Stanway, 44')  The power on that finish! Toone, Hemp and Stanway get touches on that with the Manchester City star smashing it home. Nothing the keeper could do.   Updated at 8.00pm BST    7.44pm    43 min: That goal takes White beyond Sir Bobby Charlton and Harry Kane in England\u2019s all-time scorers. She needs just three more to equal Wayne Rooney\u2019s record. North Macedonia have a free kick in a great position with Rochi the taker. But England manage to defend well and in the spell Rochi is given a yellow card. So frustrating for the playmaker who tries to make an impact before half-time.     7.42pm   GOAL! North Macedonia 0-4 England (White, 41')  A 50th England goal for White! She finally gets the luck and gets the final touch after Stanway launches the ball in from a corner.   Updated at 7.51pm BST    7.40pm    40 min: It\u2019s more of the same with England keeping their tempo up. Mead floats a ball in with Hemp running in but she concedes a foul in her attempt. The Lionesses aren\u2019t without the ball for long and this time England get the free kick. Three players loom over the ball for England and Stanway plays it short. It pings around the box with Maksuti doing well to defend. It remains in England\u2019s possession as they hunt for their fourth.     7.36pm    36 min: Panchurova makes a great save with the Mead chance and so concedes a corner. Stanway sends it in again but the hosts manage to clear well. Hemp makes another good run and she trips after a foul. The ref keeps the game going until Hemp loses the ball for a free kick. Stanway takes the set-piece and it\u2019s another fantastic save from the hosts keeper.     7.33pm    33 min: Maksuti is on the ground with an injury and it sees a big break in play. It seems she had a clash with Bronze in the air. I believe she is staying on the pitch and props to her as that looked painful. England now on attack once again and Mead almost gets a hat-trick with her shot just sailing over the bar.     7.30pm    30 min: A free kick for England almost sees a fourth goal with White heading across goal but Carter and Bright don\u2019t get to it. They are on the attack again and it feels that will be the tale all evening. Daniel has been in touch on Twitter asking if I was able to save my juice drink. Sadly all but one mouthful was spilled on the carpet, it\u2019s still drying and I spilled it almost two hours ago. I fear the carpet may be ruined.     7.27pm    27 min: Oh Ellen White, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s her night tonight! This time she slips on a chance she would have been through. She is getting in all the right places but she just needs the last touch to come off. Don\u2019t worry I haven\u2019t forgotten about the fans question, I\u2019ve asked a few colleagues. I do know the capacity at the stadium is 33,000 but as soon as I get an answer on the supporters I\u2019ll update.     7.24pm   GOAL! North Macedonia 0-3 England (Toone, 24')  What a finish by Toone! She was outside the box and running but got her shot away. England running away with it already.   Updated at 7.35pm BST    7.23pm    23 min: England continue to hammer North Macedonia\u2019s defence Ron has been in touch and asked a very valid question: \u201cWhy aren\u2019t there any fans in the North Macedonian Stadium tonight?\u201d I have to be honest, I\u2019m not too sure. I shall put feelers out and get back to you ASAP.     7.21pm    21 min: The confidence of this England side is optimised by keeper Hampton as she is so far out of her goal but she chips the ball over North Macedonian players heads! England get back into the box with Hemp pulling the trigger but her shot goes wide. The visitors could be a lot further ahead if they managed to convert these masses of chances. Again Stanway gets the ball at her feet but she skies the chance.     7.19pm    19 min: White is edging closer to her goal as once again her header comes inches away. It rattles the woodwork and her frustration is starting to show. Petrovska makes a good break and sends the hosts\u2019 first cross into the box. But no teammates were there to help her convert the chance. In terms of clumsy moments so far we\u2019ve had spilt drinks, stained shirts and a ran over laptop. Want to add yours to the list? Let me know via Twitter or email!     7.16pm    16 min: England are their own worst enemy at times with Stanway in a position to shoot just outside of the box but she doesn\u2019t take the opportunity. It came out to Toone who\u2019s pass is loose to go out for a goal kick. Mead, who\u2019s having a cracking game, slides the ball through to Toone who seems to slip to see the shot go wide. More goals are coming but little errors are halting the visitors at the moment.     7.14pm    14 min: Mead is chasing a hat-trick already with less than a quarter of this match gone! England are pressing again, not letting up despite their dominance. Hemp is causing more problems, earning a free kick which is taken quickly. But North Macedonia do well to get the ball back around the box to clear. Sadly their hard work is given away as England easily recover possession. This evening is going to be a hard graft for the hosts.     7.12pm   GOAL! North Macedonia 0-2 England (Mead, 12')  Wow that was so close! Stanway crosses it to White who\u2019s chance goes just wide. North Macedonia thread some passes in the midfield but England manage to close down the play to launch another attack. Mead looks to cross to White but the pass goes straight into goal!     7.10pm    10 min: North Macedonia\u2019s first spell of possession ends in England wrestling the ball back and passing it back to Hampton. Will the Aston villa keeper be troubled at all this evening? England run it up the pitch through Stokes. Mead and Stanway get a touch in the box but the chances go awry. Hemp again crosses in but it just escapes White once more. The keeper concedes another corner with Stanway the taker. Nikolovska does well to clear, the North Macedonia player is having a good game so far.     7.07pm    7 min: That didn\u2019t take long did it? The hosts are immediately under pressure once again following that opening goal. The ball finds itself in the box again with Bronze having a chance but she passes, wasting the opportunity. There\u2019s another corner here. Stanway is the taker once again and North Macedonia clear.     7.05pm   GOAL! North Macedonia 0-1 England (Mead, 5')  That was too easy for Mead who pounces on a ball which just escapes White. The keeper does well to defend White\u2019s shot and Mead capitalises on an open goal.   Updated at 7.16pm BST    7.04pm    4 min: So close, again Hemp crosses in with White\u2019s head connecting. The shot goes just wide, the Manchester City striker evidently hungry for goals tonight. Walsh has a sloppy touch in the midfield but England recover and get to the box once again. Nikolovska concedes the first corner of the match. Stanway takes the kick with White\u2019s head connecting once again but it\u2019s not a clean touch.     7.02pm    2 min: Predictably England have a strong start to this qualifier with all the possession so far. Hemp is making some great runs and she feeds Stanway to give England their first shot. North Macedonia deal with it well but there is a sense it could be a long evening for the hosts.     7.00pm   Kick-off! North Macedonia 0-0 England  We are underway after the teams take a knee.  How many goals can the Lionesses score this evening? And will North Macedonia\u2019s defence hold up? Kari has emailed me with a clumsy moment, saying: \u201cOnce I had to take the train to a different city for an onstage event. It was in the late afternoon, but the only train I could take arrived at noon. So I figured I\u2019d get lunch near the train station.  \u201cThe train was hours late, so when I got there I was famished, and in a hurry, and went into the first restaurant I saw, which was Italian. I ordered pasta in sauce. Anyway, before I could go on stage I had to buy a new shirt.\u201d Pasta sauce is always going to have consequences, but the taste is worth it right?     6.53pm    The teams are out and the anthems are about to begin! Just five minutes now until kick-off in this qualifier.   Updated at 7.04pm BST    6.50pm    The clumsy moments continue and Lucy is on my level with spilling drinks! She has got in touch and said she got so excited in a club because a great tune came on that she threw her drink. It bounced off the wall, onto a chair and went all over the floor.  Her story is much better than mine and she really painted a picture! Keep the clumsy moments coming, I\u2019m comforted that I am not the only person doing this. If you\u2019re confused by this discussion, I shared earlier I spilled a pint of juice on my cream carpet while trying to charge my laptop. What a start to my shift!     6.45pm    Other discussions have been around why Wiegman would play Ellen White instead of giving Alessia Russo experience. It\u2019s a difficult decision as you want to put your best foot forward, no matter the opposition, but players do need that experience - especially ahead of a big tournament. What do you think? I\u2019d love to hear your opinions.     6.40pm    England selection has a lot of discussion around it among fans and media just though the pure strength in depth the Lionesses have. One of the positions which is highly contested is goalkeeper with Hannah Hampton getting the shirt this evening. Manager Sarina Wiegman told ITV when asked who is her number one choice in goal was: \u201cAt this moment Mary Earps is our number 1, the goalkeepers are pushing each other very hard.  \u201cIt\u2019s a luxury to have [many] keepers at this level. Hannah has been playing well at her club [Aston Villa] and she hasn\u2019t had that much experience at this level.\u201d     6.33pm    I\u2019ve had some responses on the clumsy front and it has made me feel better! Francesca has said she once ran over her laptop with her car.  I have so many questions and I don\u2019t know if we have time before kick-off at 7pm! How did this occur? Was the laptop okay afterwards? Why was the laptop on the floor in the first place? Get you clumsy moments in via Twitter or email!     6.28pm    Leah Williamson may not be involved this evening due to concussion protocols but it has been a proud week for the Arsenal star. Sarina Wiegman has named her as the permanent captain for the Lionesses. Steph Houghton has been plagued with injury and the manager is looking for some continuity ahead of the Euros this summer. Today\u2019s skipper Millie Bright is the vice-captain with record scorer Ellen White the third in line.  Williamson said of being named captain earlier this week: \u201cI am honoured to be asked to lead us at the Euros.  \u201cSteph Houghton is one of this country\u2019s all-time greats and to follow in her footsteps - and all of those special names who have led the team in the past - means so much.\u201d Read the full story here.     6.22pm    Frankie has got in touch with some concern about what flavour of juice is that I\u2019ve spilled all over my cream carpet. It was a refreshing peach so the stain isn\u2019t as bad as it would have been with a blackcurrant. But it wasn\u2019t the best moment of my day! Share your clumsy stories with me or stain advice on Twitter or email.     6.15pm    Ellen White starts this evening and could add another record to her name. She is already the Lionesses\u2019 top-scorer but she could also catch Wayne Rooney\u2019s record of 53 goals. The Manchester City star has 49 scores and so she has the fixtures against North Macedonia and Northern Ireland to either equal Rooney\u2019s record with four goals or beat it with five. It will be a tall order but, with the Lionesses beating North Macedonia 8-0 the last time the two teams faced on another, it\u2019s not an impossible feat.     6.07pm    Just before the blog went live I opened my juice which I treated myself to at the coffee shop. I jumped up to charge my laptop and managed to clip the juice with my heel, I don\u2019t know how, and it\u2019s gone all over the carpet. I\u2019ve whacked vanish on it, hopefully it doesn\u2019t stain as I\u2019m renting and that will come out of my deposit! So to make myself feel better please tell me some of your clumsiest moments. Or if you know how to get a juice stain out that would be much appreciated! Let me know via Twitter (@rendellx) or by email.     6.02pm    England have revealed their line-up for tonight\u2019s qualifier and it sees Millie Bright captain the side. Leah Williamson is out due to concussion protocols. The starting XI is: Hampton, Bronze, Stokes, Walsh, Carter, Bright, Mead, Stanway, White, Toone, Hemp. Substitutes: Earps, Daly, Zelem, George, Parris, Nobbs, Russo, Scott, Roebuck.  North Macedonia, who host this evening, have also announced their squad. The starting 11 is: Panchurova, Boseska, Petrovska, Nikolovska, Joshevska, Velkova, Jakovska, Mustafa, Andonova, Maksuti, Rochi. Substitutes: Veleska, Gjorgjevska, Shemsovikj, Markovska, Saliihi, Samardzievska, Nikolova, Stojkovska, Petrushevska, Choneva, Pavlovska.  Updated at 6.10pm BST    6.00pm   Preamble  Hello and welcome to England\u2019s World Cup qualifier against North Macedonia!  The Lionesses are currently sat at the top of Group D with their opponents this evening in fifth. Sarina Wiegman\u2019s women are favourites to bag another win but North Macedonia will be looking to stem the bleeding of goals.  The last time these two sides met England raced to a 8-0 victory but they will be without many stars in this qualifier. Beth England and Niamh Charles had to withdraw after testing positive for Covid. Captain Leah Williamson has travelled with the team but she won\u2019t be playing due to concussion protocols.   Alex Greenwood and Lotte Wubben-Moy are also both out with injury.  Some fans may also be wondering where Fran Kirby is, she is being rested by Chelsea and so won\u2019t participate in today\u2019s qualifier or Tuesday\u2019s against Northern Ireland.   Despite the absences, England have a lot of stars to choose from and the team have released their starting XI so stay tuned for updates ...  Updated at 6.04pm BST "

                    "body": "So whose side are you on in the fallout following Kylian Mbapp\u00e9\u2019s decision to stay with Paris Saint-Germain? Watching the extraordinary outrage in Spain, with the press accusing the Frenchman of lacking class and La Liga branding the deal as \u201cscandalous\u201d, has raised eyebrows. But not as many as PSG being able to stump up a \u20ac200m-plus package for the world\u2019s best player \u2013 despite making a \u20ac224m loss last year.\nThere are no good guys here, only a gnawing unease that the laws of economic gravity are being defied to the further detriment of the game we love. As La Liga put it in an unprecedented attack, the transfer showed that state-owned clubs, such as the Qatar-run PSG, \u201cdo not respect and do not want to respect the rules of a sector as important as football\u201d and that \u201csporting integrity\u201d was at stake.\n\nThey are big claims and La Liga has backed them up with a vow to file a complaint to Uefa and the EU. Yet Real Madrid are hardly paragons of virtue in this area. Last year they were central to the European Super League project, which threatened the sporting integrity of European football far more than Mbapp\u00e9 staying with PSG. Recently they were also one of four Spanish clubs ordered by the EU\u2019s highest court to pay back millions of euros after it ruled they had benefited from state aid.\nPSG have privately brushed off La Liga\u2019s attacks, with one executive insisting to me that its \u20ac224m loss was allowed under the current Uefa financial fair play rules, which were loosened because of the pandemic. It is also understood that at a PSG board meeting this month it was revealed that Lionel Messi made the club \u20ac15m last season, even after all his costs were taken into account.\nThe message was clear. Yes, Mbapp\u00e9\u2019s deal is crazily expensive. But the club believe they can make that money back and abide by Uefa\u2019s new financial fair play rules that come into effect in 2025.\nPerhaps. But cynics will hope the rules are more robust than the previous incarnation, which proved easier to circumvent than the Maginot Line \u2013 with PSG and Manchester City among those found guilty. There are also well-founded fears that state-run clubs are creating inflationary pressures in the transfer market, while PSG\u2019s chief executive Nasser al-Khelaifi\u2019s enormous influence across Uefa and the European Club Association is also impossible to ignore.\nTo my mind, though, the reaction to Mbapp\u00e9\u2019s new deal goes beyond the understandable squeamishness about sovereign wealth funds running clubs. It is also about how easy it is for the teams to entrench their advantage and ruin leagues. Would anyone bet against PSG, who have won eight of the past 10 Ligue 1 titles, winning next year? And the year after that? Or Bayern Munich, who have won 10 Bundesliga titles in a row, another procession?\n\nOf course there are exceptions \u2013 look at Manchester United. But while English football is certainly more unpredictable, as was seen again on a dramatic final day, Manchester City have still won four Premier League titles in five years and just eight clubs have finished in the top three in the past 25 years. Eight! \u2013 the same number as in the first five years of the Premier League between 1992-93 and 1996-97, when Norwich, Blackburn and Aston Villa all challenged for the title.\nData from the website Sporting Intelligence, which tracks player salaries across multiple leagues and sports, shows there is a strong link between the amount a club spend on wages and where they finish in the table. But it does not have to be that way.\nIn the US, where salary caps, luxury taxes and drafts for college players ensure that the major leagues are kept spicy and dicey, the difference is stark. Major League Baseball has had eight World Series winners in the past decade and five further teams finishing as runners-up. In other words, 13 of the MLB\u2019s 30 teams have fought for the sport\u2019s biggest prize in the past 10 years.\nIn the NHL, meanwhile, 14 of the league\u2019s 32 clubs have played in a Stanley Cup final since 2012. In the NFL the figure is 13 out of 32, with some teams able to go from also\u2011rans to Super Bowl contenders within a couple of years.\nCuriously, though, that lack of football\u2019s competitive balance has not dented the game\u2019s popularity. One explanation, based on detailed analysis of the data by the economists Dr Babatunde Buraimo and Dr Rob Simmons, is that TV audiences are far less interested in watching competitive matches than they once were \u2013 and instead they want the big names, regardless of the opposition.\nAnd there is no one bigger than Mbapp\u00e9 right now. According to one football executive I spoke to, the deal emphasises an even bigger shift in power in favour of players, more of whom are content to run down their contracts deliberately so they get all the money from a new deal.\n\nThat executive also pointed out that it made sense for Mbapp\u00e9 to wait and play off PSG and Real Madrid. And also for PSG to pay a huge signing-on fee rather than have to sign another player from a competitor club.\nIt is hard to argue with that. But whether football\u2019s ghoulish freakonomics is as beneficial for the rest of us is another matter entirely."

Volkswagen, which is planning to float 12.5% on 29 September, has priced the shares in Porsche at between \u20ac76.50 (\u00a367.14) and \u20ac82.50. The \u20ac70bn to \u20ac75bn valuation range, the midpoint of analysts\u2019 expectations, will result in Volkswagen receiving \u20ac8.7bn to \u20ac9.4bn.  The company has said it intends to use 49% of the proceeds to pay a one-off special dividend to shareholders, with the remainder to help fund the costly shift towards electric vehicles and battery technology. The listing will comprise 911m shares, a nod to the historic car brand\u2019s most famous model, divided into 455.5m preferred shares and 455.5m ordinary shares. Up to 113.8m of the preferred shares, carrying no voting rights, will be placed with investors in what will be Germany\u2019s second largest initial public offering to date. If Porsche hits its upper-end valuation it will become Europe\u2019s third largest stock market float on record, according to Refinitiv data. The sovereign wealth funds of Qatar, Abu Dhabi and Norway as well as the mutual fund company T Rowe Price will subscribe up to \u20ac3.68bn worth of preferred shares. \u201cWe are now in the home stretch with the IPO plans for Porsche and welcome the commitment of our cornerstone investors,\u201d the Volkswagen chief financial officer and chief operating officer, Arno Antlitz, said. As part of the partial float, the Porsche-Pi\u00ebch families, who are VW\u2019s anchor shareholders, will buy a further 12.5% of Porsche, at a premium of 7.5% on the price of the shares offered to the general public. The families\u2019 shareholding, which will rise to 25% plus one ordinary share, will carry voting rights. Porsche SE, the Porsche-Pi\u00ebch investment vehicle, said it would finance the acquisition of its Porsche shares with debt capital of up to \u20ac7.9bn. The proceeds of the sale of shares to the Porsche-Pi\u00ebch families, who lost direct control of the company when VW bought Porsche in a reverse takeover in 2012, will bring in up to \u20ac10bn. Total proceeds from the sale will be \u20ac18.1bn to \u20ac19.5bn. "

                    "body": "An unusual lot at the Keeneland November breeding stock sale on Monday will put a price on Flightline, the brilliant \u2013 and now retired \u2013 winner of Saturday\u2019s Breeders\u2019 Cup Classic. A 2.5% slice of the world\u2019s best racehorse will be sold to the highest bidder and when the hammer falls, most guesstimates suggest Flightline will be worth at least $70m.\nRarity value alone will bump the price, of course, but Flightline did everything that any fan \u2013 or breeder \u2013 could have hoped to see in what turned out to be his final start. The winning margin of eight and a quarter lengths was a record for the Classic, and Flightline powered clear, under a hand ride, after sitting just behind a blistering pace for the first mile.\n\nAfter a near 50-year wait for a horse that could even be mentioned in the same breath as the extraordinary Secretariat, however, there was understandable frustration on Sunday that Flightline had been snatched away to stud after just six races. Perhaps inevitably too, for some fans that spilled over into revisionism about the depth of Flightline\u2019s talent. How, they asked, can any horse be called an all-time great after half a dozen starts?\nBut these are different times, with different values and priorities, and no champion is ever likely to have a campaign like Secretariat, who packed 21 races into a 16-month career and retired at the end of his three-year-old season. The great Cigar, meanwhile, raced 33 times in all, including seven starts on turf before he found his true calling on the dirt and racked up a record-equalling 16-race win streak. It might also be recalled that when he finally went to stud at the end of his six-year-old season, Cigar proved to be infertile.\nWhen it comes to Flightline, though, it was always going to be the case that the better his performance in the Classic at Keeneland, the more certain it would be that he would be settling into his new life as a stallion at Lanes End Farm before Christmas. There comes a point these days when a horse like Flightline is simply too valuable to race, not least when he struts his stuff on dirt, a surface which \u2013 according to the 2021 Equine Injury Database report \u2013 has twice the rate of fatal injuries per 1,000 starts as an artificial surface.\nIt remains to be seen whether Saturday\u2019s valedictory success is enough to move Flightline alongside Frankel \u2013 or perhaps even in front of Sir Henry Cecil\u2019s unbeaten champion \u2013 in the ratings. And at moments like this, it is also worth recalling the wise words of Chris Williams in a letter to the Racing Post several years ago. \u201cIf ever my life becomes so empty,\u201d he wrote, \u201cmy intellect so shrivelled and my conversation so dull, that I resort to insisting a good horse from one era is, or is not, better than one from years ago, please shoot me.\u201d\n\nBut wherever Flightline ends up in the official pantheon, and regardless of whether he is a success or a flop at stud, the best measure of his worth and legacy will be the millions of racing fans around the world who will never forget the thrill of seeing him extend and accelerate off the final turn at Keeneland on Saturday.\nHis win set the perfect seal on a Breeders\u2019 Cup which had already featured several outstanding finishes, and underlined the extent to which US racing is beginning to find its feet after years of steady decline. For the second year running, the total betting \u201chandle\u201d over the 14 Breeders\u2019 Cup races was a record, up 3.4% on 2021 at $189,060,373, while the success of European-trained runners in the turf events, with six wins out of seven, can only encourage an even more concerted assault on next year\u2019s meeting at Santa Anita.\n\nThat will mark the 40th running of the Breeders\u2019 Cup, an event which started with just seven races at the now-defunct Hollywood Park in 1984. Now entirely Lasix-free, it has started to thrive once again in its late 30s, and the return to Santa Anita, the most popular venue in the rotation, promises to be another weekend to anticipate and cherish."

Thanks for reading everyone.\nThere\u2019s only one man who could play us out\u2026\n\n\n\n\n 5.24pm  \n\nSo, West Ham boss David Moyes *thrusts mic in face*\u2026 would YOU like to have done a Chelsea and spent \u00a3320m on eight new transfers in the transfer window, ballooning your squad to 33 players?\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure I would. I think sometimes you want to build a team and take it forward. It\u2019s not an easy job. The hardest part as a manager is who to leave out,\u201d said Moyes ahead of West Ham\u2019s London derby clash with Chelsea at the London Stadium this weekend.\n\u201cIt can take time, I can tell you that with us bringing new players in. I think when you spend \u00a3600million, it should give you half a chance. But money isn\u2019t the only thing to do with football, you\u2019ve got to get the team right, you\u2019ve got to get other parts of it going well.\n\u201cHopefully we can give Chelsea a good game, obviously they are a really good team, they\u2019ve got some really talented players they\u2019ve bought in, but they will need time to gel just like the ones we brought in in the summer have taken a bit of time to gel as well.\u201d\nWest Ham are only a point above the drop zone after a difficult campaign but Moyes is looking up not down.\n\u201cI believe we can have a good season. We have still got a lot to play for. I think we\u2019re showing a little bit better signs in some areas but we\u2019re going to be challenged by good teams like Chelsea, we\u2019re going to be challenged in the European competition, which we\u2019re going into again in March, and we\u2019re in the next round of the FA Cup.\n\u201cWe want to try and keep ourselves involved in as many tournaments as we can. But our focus is solely on the Chelsea game and trying to do the best we can against Chelsea.\u201d\n\n\n\n 5.10pm  \n\nAnd here\u2019s Louise Taylor on Leeds United\u2019s hunt to replace Jesse Marsch.\n\nYou\u2019ve seen these no doubt but it seems the right time to crowbar them in.\n\n\n\n\n\n 5.01pm  \n\nHere\u2019s Jamie Jackson\u2019s piece from the Pep press conference.\n\n\n\n\n 4.56pm  \n\nRead all about it. Read all about it\u2026 the Football Daily is out. \n\u201cGuardiola swung haymakers in all directions; he presented one of the world\u2019s richest clubs as a noble, put-upon underdog; and he established a siege mentality with such coruscating precision that Football Daily instantly bet the farm on City winning the Premier League this season. It\u2019s a risky tactic, because he\u2019ll be eating mea culpas for the rest of his natural-born days if City are found guilty, but in the short-term it felt like a cynically brilliant response to unprecedented adversity.\u201d\n\nAnd, looking through the e-mails, \u2018Peter Oh\u2019s Pun Corner\u2019 brings us this: \u201cCity missed a huge PR opportunity by not signing B. Innocent from French Ligue 1 club Lorient during the transfer window.\u201d\n\n\n\n 4.46pm  \n\nBrighton boss Roberto De Zerbi is relishing his first crack at the A23 derby. The Seagulls take on Crystal Palace at Selhurst Park in one of five Saturday 3pm kick-offs in the Premier League.\nDe Zerbi said: \u201cI live for this game. It\u2019s an honour to play this game. We must play a bold game, aggressive game, but I don\u2019t want to lose our quality, our style of play. The first part of the season has been fantastic in terms of results, in terms of quality of play, and we have to continue in this way. But tomorrow is a different game.\n\u201cThe emotions are the most important part of football and we have to feel the emotion in the football. But we have to be clear to the other things, to be focused on the game, on our quality, on our style of play, but we have to feel it\u2019s a different game. We want to beat them for sure. We want to make our fans happy. It will be a very important game for us. I love this kind of game, we are ready to play.\u201d\nWorld Cup winner Alexis Mac Allister is back for Brighton following the Argentina midfielder\u2019s one-match ban for picking up five yellow cards. \u201cIt will be great to have Alexis back, he will play tomorrow,\u201d said De Zerbi. \u201cHe\u2019s a very important player for us, it\u2019s excellent to have him available.\u201d\n\n\n\n 4.36pm  \n\nFulham scored three times in six crazy second-half minutes to win 3-2 at Nottingham Forest earlier in the season. That result left Fulham sixth and Forest languishing in 19th with four points from seven games.\nFast forward to this weekend and while Fulham have continued to flourish (they\u2019re eighth), Forest have climbed to 13th, six points clear of the drop zone.\nHere\u2019s Fulham boss Marco Silva. \u201cIt will be a another tough one. They are different than when we played against them at Forest. I can say completely different, even if most of the players who started that game are going to start again.\n\u201cBut there is a slight difference in some players, they again signed good players in January. We are talking about a club that signed around 25 or 26 players this season. Of course they need time to gel, to put everything in the right direction. They are in good momentum and they want to keep the momentum for sure, but they know as well that it will be tough for them.\n\u201cEveryone that comes to play at the Cottage, normally it is tough for them to play, with the environment that we play, we like to play on the front foot every time. The players feel really well and comfortable with our style, with the way we approach the game.\u201d\nFun fact: Fulham could complete the Premier League double over an opponent for the first time since 2013/14, when they did so against both Aston Villa and Norwich City.\n\n\n\n 4.26pm  \n\nFancy a Friday quiz? It\u2019s a general sports one but has four football questions, including a beaut about Bayern Munich defender Dayot Upamecano.\n\n\n\n\n 4.20pm  \n\nBrentford start the weekend in seventh place. Perhaps even more impressive is that they\u2019ve lost just four of their 21 Premier League games this season. Only Newcastle and Arsenal have suffered fewer. \nBrentford have already won away at Manchester City this term and they\u2019ll hope to cause a similar upset at leaders Arsenal on Saturday.\nHere\u2019s boss Thomas Frank on the task in hand. \u201cI always believe that we can win, but \u2013 and it is a big but \u2013 we are facing Arsenal who are top of the league. They have been going from strength to strength and they are in a fantastic position.\n\u201c[Mikel] Arteta has done a top job in building a culture over three years, making difficult decisions and sharpening a style of play. Arsenal can smell that they have a chance to win the league. It is well deserved that they are top. They look in sync and they have all their key players fit and available. At home they play with an unbelievable intensity.\n\u201cYou can see that they are running harder and in the duels they are giving everything. They are so eager to win and that makes it even more difficult to beat them. To get anything out of this game, we need to top perform. We will probably need the best performance we have ever put out in a Premier League game.\u201d\nBut Frank knows the worth of his own side. \u201cI hope teams respect us for what we are capable of. In this group of players there are a lot of strong characters. They have been growing as individuals. It is a good feeling going into a game knowing that if we top perform then we can do something.\n\u201cWe have always been quite strong defensively, with a good structure, mentality and principles, but now we are in a spell where everything is melted together and it is just working.\u201d \n\n\n\n 4.09pm  \n\nSome more Graham Potter lines from Chelsea\u2019s press conference.\nOn the future of striker Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, who has been excluded from Chelsea\u2019s Champions League squad alongside Benoit Badiashile: \u201cNothing to report. He\u2019s been training with us this week, training really well. Conducting himself well, really good professional, supporting his team-mates. Whilst he\u2019s here he\u2019s doing exactly what I expect him to do, which is to train well and to act well.\u201d\nOn feeling the pressure : \u201cThere\u2019ll be lots of talk around pressure and time. If I\u2019d had a month of time for every time I\u2019ve been asked the question, I\u2019d be here for about 10 years. That\u2019s just the nature of it.\n\u201cI\u2019m not stupid. If the results aren\u2019t what this club should get, and I\u2019m the reason for it, then that\u2019s the job. In the meantime, I go through the process of working with the players, helping them improve, helping them come together.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a complicated situation at the moment. But I\u2019m really excited for it, looking forward to it, really looking forward to the challenge that awaits us. I don\u2019t worry too much about the absolute time scale of it all.\u201d\n\n\n\n 3.59pm  \n\nErling Haaland didn\u2019t have a single touch in the Spurs box in Manchester City\u2019s 1-0 defeat last weekend. But he\u2019s second in this list. Are we slightly surprised by the high placings of Arsenal\u2019s Gabriels given Jesus\u2019s injury absence and Martinelli\u2019s starting position on the left? Maybe Martinelli takes lots of dinky touches in there, like Salah.\n\n\n\n\n 3.52pm  \n\nIf you want to study Pep\u2019s body language \u2013 and choice of cardigan \u2013 this is the video for you.\n\n\n\n\n 3.47pm  \n\nHistory says Aston Villa boss Unai Emery is even more up against it than we think when his team travel to Manchester City on Sunday. From Opta:\n\nManchester City have won their last 12 Premier League home games against Aston Villa, coming from 2-0 down to win 3-2 and secure the Premier League title on the final day of the season.\nAston Villa manager Unai Emery has never beaten Man City\u2019s Pep Guardiola in 12 previous meetings in all competitions, drawing four and losing eight.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve played against Manchester City here and in the Champions League, it\u2019s a very difficult match. Maybe it\u2019s going to be more difficult now with the issues they are having,\u201d said Emery, using his words carefully.\n\u201cI think they\u2019re going to be together and they are going to try and respond on the pitch against us. It\u2019s a very difficult match. Manchester City are building a team to win the Champions League and they are getting close to doing it. In the Premier League they have had amazing results over the last few years. Each year it\u2019s Manchester United, Liverpool, Chelsea, Tottenham, and this year it\u2019s Arsenal, to be close to them. \n\u201cI want to play the same matches in the same competitive way at home and away. We are going to focus on this Sunday\u2019s match, trying to get the same performance away as we did before.\u201d\n\n\n\n 3.36pm  \n\nLeeds interim boss Michael Skubala secured a 2-2 draw at Old Trafford in midweek and he\u2019ll hope to go one better when he locks horns with Manchester United and Erik ten Hag again on Sunday. Skubala will remain in charge while Leeds hunt for a permanent new manager following the departure of Jesse Marsch.\nTalking of which, the PA understands they are still working on a four-man shortlist despite being turned down by Feyenoord boss Arne Slot. That doesn\u2019t seem to have registered with the bookies who still have Slot as favourite. The next four in the betting are Rayo Vallecano coach Andoni Iraola, former Wolves and Spurs manager Nuno Espirito Santo, Marcello Gallardo and Skubala himself. For the record, local news reports in Leeds say former River Plate boss Gallardo has turned down an offer. All a bit vague, isn\u2019t it.\nAnyway, Skubala said: \u201cI\u2019ve been having clear communication every day with [director of football] Victor [Orta]. I expect to be in charge on Sunday. Back-to-back games are unusual, there may be one or two tweaks to the side, but there\u2019s nothing we can change majorly. We can get work done tomorrow and a bit of shape.\n\u201cWe did really well (on Wednesday) but it\u2019s still one point. The book\u2019s closed and Sunday\u2019s a chance for three points.\u201d\nTeam news-wise, skipper Liam Cooper and Marc Roca missed out in midweek due to respective muscle strains and will be assessed. Skubala is hoping Luis Sinisterra can recover from a strain sustained at Old Trafford. Pascal Struijk will miss out under the concussion protocol. He was withdrawn on Wednesday after blocking a shot from Marcus Rashford with his head.\n\n\n\n 3.23pm  \n\nAnd now for Chelsea boss Graham Potter. Can the club\u2019s spending spree trigger a charge up the table? Or will Potter continue to carry the bafflement of a child brought up playing contentedly with wooden toys who has had a pile of shiny new PlayStations thrust upon him.\nThe good news. Joao Felix returns after serving a three-match ban for his red card at Fulham. \u201cIt\u2019s great to have him back. I think we all saw the impact that he had in his 60 minutes before the red card. You could see his quality, I see it every day.\n\u201cHe\u2019s a player that I think can make a difference for us but at the same time it\u2019s about helping him get into the team, get integrated into the team and to the team-mates around him and for him to understand what we\u2019re trying to do, but the signs are really positive.\u201d\nThe bad news. Raheem Sterling has picked up a fresh injury. \u201cWe had a little set-back with Raheem, he had a kick in training so we\u2019re assessing him. I think he\u2019s probably doubtful for tomorrow I\u2019d say. It\u2019s a new injury, he just got a kick in training on the side of his knee.\u201d\n\u2018No one else is back but they\u2019re all getting closer and closer. Wesley has been training with the team, Denis has been training with the team.\nFinally, some news on Wesley Fofana, Denis Zakaria and Mateo Kovacic. \u201cNo one else is back but they\u2019re all getting closer and closer. Wesley has been training with the team, Denis has been training with the team. Mateo\u2019s training with the team, but it will be too soon for him. So there\u2019s good news, we\u2019ve got some options.\u201d\n\nUpdated at 4.01pm GMT\n\n\n 3.08pm  \n\nEverton striker Dominic Calvert-Lewin is a major doubt for Monday\u2019s Merseyside derby at Anfield. The England international played just over an hour of last weekend\u2019s win over Arsenal but afterwards manager Sean Dyche admitted it had been a risk as the player was struggling with a hamstring problem. That has prevented him from training this week and puts his participation at Anfield in doubt.\n\u201cWe\u2019re still monitoring him. It will be touch and go, at best, I would think,\u201d said Dyche. \u201cWe\u2019re hoping it settles down as quickly as possible. He put a real shift in, his stats were very good in the last game and unfortunately he\u2019s got a niggly hamstring and we\u2019ve got to get on top of it as quick as we can.\u201d\nLosing Calvert-Lewin would be a significant blow as Dyche\u2019s only other options are Neal Maupay, who is a long way from being a target man, and 22-year-old Ellis Simms, recently recalled from a loan spell at Sunderland and with just three first-team Everton appearances to his name. But Dyche is keen to maintain the positivity and suggested it was an opportunity for someone to stake their claim.\n\u201cWe adapt to the players that we work with. The obvious two are Simmsy and Neal,\u201d he added on the effect Calvert-Lewin\u2019s absence would have. \u201cThere are different ways the team can operate. I don\u2019t look at one player to try to win games, it has to be a team collective. It is a great opportunity whoever plays next. What a game to be stepping into if he is not right. Get ready to take it on.\u201d (PA Media)\n\n\n\n 3.06pm  \n\nThanks Will. Let\u2019s open with Dyche...\n\n\n\n 3.04pm  \n\nRight, it\u2019s time for me to hand over to Dave Tindall. He\u2019ll bring you the latest from Potter and Dyche. Have a good weekend all.\n\n\n\n 3.03pm  \nArteta says Jesus 'doing really well'\n\nAsked about the timeline for Gabriel Jesus\u2019s return, with the forward sidelined since injuring his knee with Brazil at the World Cup, Arteta sounds cautiously optimistic but declines to give an exact date. \u201cHe\u2019s doing really well, he keeps pushing everyone every single day, but we need to respect some timelines. It\u2019s too far [to set a date]. You have to see now when you start to put some load through that knee, and start to get some movement and some action, how that knee reacts and whether he is comfortable to go to the next stage.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n 2.58pm  \n\nMikel Arteta, Graham Potter and Sean Dyche have taken their places in front of the assorted microphones, dictaphones and plain old phones, with all due credit to the voice memos app. Let\u2019s start with Arteta, who has to find a way past Brentford at the Emirates this weekend. Asked about last Saturday\u2019s defeat to Everton, he says: \u201cIt\u2019s not about being in a comfort zone. We are going to lose matches. Each defeat brings an opportunity to look at other things and see a reaction from the team. Tomorrow we are going to try to put in a great performance in front of our fans and try to win the game.\u201d\n\n\nUpdated at 2.59pm GMT\n\n\n 2.43pm  \n\n\u2026 and here\u2019s Jamie Jackson with more from Ten Hag, who is also delighted with Marcus Rashford\u2019s electric form.\n\n\n\n\n 2.42pm  \n\nHere\u2019s Suzanne Wrack with some analysis of the Women\u2019s Champions League draw. Chelsea have what looks like the toughest quarter-final tie on paper, having been paired with Lyon.\n\n\n\n\n 2.37pm  \n\nErik ten Hag, meanwhile, has also been speaking to the media. He has some qualified praise for Alejandro Garnacho, the teenage winger enjoying a breakout season at Old Trafford. \u201cI think he is doing well, he has an impact on our game, I think he is a threat. [In our 2-2 draw at home to Leeds] he had good actions, he was lively, created chances, but had to score. And, finally, it\u2019s about that, that you have an effect. \n\u201cAs a striker, you have to at least be on the scoring list, the assist list or key action list to have the right impact. As a Man United player, we expect you to have an impact: to influence the score, to influence the result, to positively influence the game by scoring goals and having an assist.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n 2.21pm  \n\nThere will no doubt be plenty of analysis of Guardiola\u2019s comments to come, but, for the moment, let\u2019s leave it there. Elsewhere, as reported by Voetbal International in the Netherlands, Arne Slot, the Feyenoord manager, has no intention of leaving midway through the season to succeed Jesse Marsch at Leeds.\n\n\nUpdated at 2.26pm GMT\n\n\n 2.17pm  \n\nIt should be noted that, as opposed to being found \u201cinnocent\u201d when their Champions League ban was overturned, City were still fined \u20ac10m for failing to cooperate with the investigation, while other aspects of Uefa\u2019s case were found to be time-barred.\n\n\n\n\n\n 2.08pm  \nGuardiola says 'there are no enemies or friends, just interests'\n\nGuardiola pointedly lists the nine teams that wrote to Cas in support of City\u2019s Champions League ban. \u201cIn this world there are not enemies or friends, there are just interests,\u201d he says, which seems like a vaguely terrifying sentiment. He jokes that, if City are relegated to League Two, they will call up Paul Dickov and Mike Summerbee, get the band back together and bounce back to the Premier League. \u201cBut we should wait, because at the end, OK, the Premier League are going to decide and, OK, we are going to defend ourselves like what happened with the Uefa situation.\u201d\n\n\nUpdated at 2.39pm GMT\n\n\n 2.04pm  \n\n\u201cI would love to wait and see,\u201d adds Guardiola. \u201cTime will see, or time will dictate, what\u2019s going to happen. Just in case we are not innocent, we will accept what the judge, the Premier League, decides. But what happens if, in the same situation as with Uefa happened, we are innocent? What happens to restore or pay back our damage?\u201d\n\n\n\n 2.01pm  \n\nThere\u2019s more where that came from. \u201cAnother side I would say is that we are lucky we live in a marvellous country and society where everyone is innocent until proven guilty. We didn\u2019t have this opportunity, we are already sentenced, and \u2018tough\u2019. What happened, I don\u2019t know. On the other side, personally, I am happy that we are here, like Uefa happened. OK, we have a chance to defend [ourselves] \u2026 I think we have good lawyers, Uefa had good lawyers, and the Premier League \u2013 with 19 teams \u2013 are going to take up good lawyers too to defend their position, like we are going to defend our position.\u201d\n\n\n\n 1.57pm  \n\nGuardiola launches into a fierce defence of the club, referencing City\u2019s Champions League ban being overturned in 2020 and the nine clubs that wrote to the court of arbitration for sport calling for the ban to be upheld. \u201cYou have to understand that 19 teams of the Premier League are accusing us without the opportunity to defend [ourselves]. The word of my club, my owner, my chairman, my CEO, my people, who have explained everything over these three or four years\u2026 you know exactly on what side I am.\u201d\n\n\n\n 1.47pm  \nGuardiola's press conference gets under way\n\nRight, here he is. Straight to the point, he\u2019s asked whether, having pledged to leave City if the hierarchy lied to him, he still has confidence in the club. He starts by conveying his and the club\u2019s sympathies to the victims of the earthquakes which have hit Turkey and Syria. \u201cMy first thought is that we have already been condemned,\u201d he says, in reference to the Premier League charges. \u201cWhat\u2019s happening right now, what happened on Monday is the same as what happened with Uefa \u2026 we\u2019ve had already accusations and now we have just \u2018charged\u2019.\u201d\n\n\nUpdated at 1.47pm GMT\n\n\n 1.27pm  \n\nBefore anyone sends me an email containing the words \u201cbias\u201d or \u201cagenda\u201d, it\u2019s best to just repost Max Rushden\u2019s take on the subject. It feels like this piece would dovetail nicely with the \u201cdon\u2019t make me tap the sign\u201d meme.\n\n\n\n\n 1.17pm  \n\nJamie Jackson, our very own Manchester football correspondent, is in situ. Popcorn just out of shot.\n\n\n\n\n 1.12pm  \n\nNot been keeping up with the latest City furore? Here\u2019s some light reading to get you up to speed.\n\n\n\n\nUpdated at 1.13pm GMT\n\n\n 1.08pm  \n\nHello all. Me again, just in time for the day\u2019s big press conference at Manchester City. Here\u2019s a reminder of why it\u2019s so hotly anticipated. Namely, the Premier League charging the club with allegedly breaching its rules on more than 100 occasions.\n\n\n\n\n 1.02pm  \n\nI\u2019m going to tag in Will Magee, as I need to scrutinise Pep\u2019s body language for the purposes of our Football Daily email. Thanks for your company, ta-ra. \n\n\n\n 12.58pm  \n\nWatch Cristiano Ronaldo score his 500th league goal (and nos 501-503)\nI have no idea what to make of this. Historic? Endearing? Odd? Tragicomic? Pathetic? Poignant?\n\n\n\n\n 12.55pm  \n\nA question that has the square root of bugger all to do with football, but to which an answer would be nonetheless appreciated.\nDoes anyone know how I can watch Poker Face in the UK? Legally, ideally, but I\u2019ll try anything once.\n\n\n\n 12.53pm  \n\nOne of the items on Sky Sports\u2019 breaking news ticker is\u2026 Patrick Vieira press conference coming up. I can\u2019t lie to you: I\u2019m not entirely sure this is the future that Walter Cronkite envisaged when he interrupted As The World Turns on 22 November 1963.\n\n\n\n\n 12.48pm  \n\nLook, it\u2019s not us, it\u2019s you\nThis piece from Max is spot on. To suggest an organised conspiracy gives far too much credit to an essentially shambolic industry. In 23 years of this nonsense, I\u2019ve never come across a deliberate or conscious agenda.Except against me, obviously, which is why I\u2019m being paid six figures to write one nerdy yet inexplicably compelling longread a month.\n\n\nUpdated at 12.50pm GMT\n\n\n 12.42pm  \n\nNever mind the WCL, there\u2019s a huge game in the WSL tomorrow: Manchester City v Arsenal. \nThere\u2019s a serious chance that one of these teams will finish outside the top three for the first time since 2014. That would mean missing out of the Champions League. \nIn that sense, it\u2019s a mustn\u2019t lose game. But if they want to maintain their title challenge, it\u2019s probably a must-win game.\n\n\n\n\n 12.30pm  \n\nOn this day in 1996\u2026 Tino Asprilla\u2019s memorable debut takes Newcastle closer to the Premier League title.

I don\u2019t know about you, but I usually despair when people preview press conferences, even more so when they then call them \u201cpressers\u201d. But given the week Manchester City have had, this should be worth following.\nI can see Pep\u2019s weary face now as he\u2019s asked for the 48th time about the minutiae of his employment contract, when all he really wants to talk about is overloads in wide areas. \n\n\n\n 12.25pm  \n\nOn this day in 2002\u2026 Sylvain Wiltord\u2019s freak goal kickstarts the greatest winning run in Arsenal\u2019s history.\n\n\n\n\n 12.23pm  \n\nSo, the dream domestic final is still on.

This led to a cracking question in this week\u2019s Knowledge, which I had the abundant pleasure of researching.\nI promise, if you\u2019re a league-table nerd, this isn\u2019t clickbait; it\u2019s clickbloodyoxygen.\n\n\n\n\n 10.16am  \n\nFulham v Nottm Forest (Saturday, 3pm)\nAlthough they have not won a league match in nearly a month, there is no doubting Fulham\u2019s gathering sense of purpose this season. Narrow league defeats by Newcastle and Tottenham were followed by a goalless draw against Chelsea before this week\u2019s FA Cup fourth-round replay win at Sunderland (despite nine changes) that set up a fifth-round tie against Leeds.\nThe manager, Marco Silva, will be back in the dugout for the visit of Nottingham Forest, another side finding their feet in the top division, having served a one-match touchline ban. \u201cOf course I want to be with my players \u2026 to feel the emotions of the game in a different way,\u201d Silva told the BBC on Wednesday after paying his dues. \u201cThe view is much, much better \u2026 you can see everything in a different way,\u201d Silva said of his evening in the Stadium of Light stands.\nHe might be saying the same of Fulham\u2019s lofty league position if they can successfully unlock Steve Cooper\u2019s miserly defence: victory could potentially lift them up to sixth place. Forest were arguably fortunate to keep Leeds at bay in their 1-0 win last Sunday, and there will be plenty more defending to do in south-west London. Based on their own confidence-boosting Premier League run, Cooper\u2019s side will approach the match without fear. Luke McLaughlin\n\nUpdated at 10.18am GMT\n\n\n 10.15am  \n\nEddie Howe on Christian Atsu, who is still missing after the earthquakes in Turkey and Syria\n\nIt\u2019s hugely worrying. Really, really enjoyed working with Christian [when he was on loan at Bournemouth] \u2013 great lad, great player. Thoughts are with him and his family. We hope there\u2019s some good news. We hope he\u2019s okay. But we\u2019re really concerned for him and his welfare. It\u2019s been difficult because they have been conflicting stories about his whereabouts\u2026 I can\u2019t imagine how his family are feeling. From the bottom of our hearts we wish him well and hope there\u2019s a positive ending.\n\nThen, after a slightly awkward segue, Howe confirmed that Alexander Isak has passed concussion protocols and will be in the squad for Newcastle\u2019s trip to Bournemouth.\n\nUpdated at 11.05am GMT\n\n\n 10.06am  \n\nLiverpool\u2019s Jota may return against Everton\nJurgen Klopp is getting his press conference out the way so he can enjoy his Friday, like Alvy Singer and Annie Hall having their first kiss before the meal so that they can digest their food better.\nHe seems amiable enough, if a little coiled, and says that the intensity of Liverpool\u2019s training has been extremely good this week. Diogo Jota was among those training with the requisite intensity, and Klopp says he could be involved against Everton on Monday night. Roberto Firmino may also be in the squad, but it\u2019s too early for Virgil van Dijk. Thiago Alcantara is also doubtful because of a hip problem.\nOh, and Klopp had absolutely nothing (say it again) to say about Manchester City.\n\n\nUpdated at 10.21am GMT\n\n\n 10.01am  \nPreamble\n\nRight, who\u2019s got that Friday feeling? I\u2019ll tell you who hasn\u2019t: Pep Guardiola. For a start he\u2019s working the weekend, again, and before that, at around 1.30pm, he has to endure a press conference in which the first 474 questions will all be about Manchester City\u2019s alleged financial tomfoolery.\nAt the best of times Pep fulfils his media commitments with all the loquaciousness and joie de vivre of an introvert on a stag do. These, emphatically, are not the best of times.\nAs well as a forensic study of Pep\u2019s face as he processes yet another passive-aggressive reminder of his pledge to quit City if they ever lied to him, we\u2019ll have the usual hype and bullishness ahead of an important weekend in the Premier League. It\u2019s a pretty good set of fixtures, including some of English football\u2019s bigger rivalries.\nSaturday (3pm unless stated)\n\nWest Ham v Chelsea (12.30pm)\nArsenal v Brentford\nCrystal Palace v Brighton\nFulham v Nottingham Forest\nLeicester v Tottenham\nSouthampton v Wolves\nBournemouth v Newcastle (5.30pm)\n\nSunday\n\nLeeds v Man Utd (2pm)\nMan City v Aston Villa (4.30pm)\n\nMonday\n\nLiverpool v Everton (8pm)\n\n\nUpdated at 1.18pm GMT\n"

                    "body": "J\u00fcrgen Klopp believes Fenway Sports Group\u2019s search for fresh investment is necessary to allow Liverpool to compete for the best talents on the market. The Liverpool manager, who will miss today\u2019s meeting with Southampton after being handed a one-match ban for his red card against Manchester City last month, has welcomed the decision of the club\u2019s owner to seek investment. While Klopp is unsure about the size of the stake that could be sold or the timeframe, is confident it will increase his spending power. With Jude Bellingham likely to be priced at \u00a3100m or more next summer, should Borussia Dortmund decide to sell the Liverpool target, Klopp admits the club may need to change its spending model to continue to sign proven quality.  \u201cIn the structure we had we were obviously able to spend money but we always had to look and say: \u2018What did we earn?\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cThat was always the situation. The two biggest transfers we did in the past with Ali [Alisson] and Virg [Virgil van Dijk], we all know how it happened. We got some money from Barcelona [\u00a3142m for Philippe Coutinho] and spent it wisely, I would say. \u201cHow we did it so far brought us to where we are, fine, but fresh money is no mistake, let me say it like this,\u201d Klopp added. \u201cNothing gets cheaper. There is the inflation rate for all of us and in football as well. Sometimes you have to spend. \u201cWe are really happy, really happy, to give all our young kids a chance. I am so positive about the impact they will have in the future whenever that starts. Like Harvey [Elliott] now, Stefan [Bajcetic], Calvin [Ramsay], Ben Doak, Bobby Clark \u2013 really interesting. They all are. But from time to time you have to throw in proven quality. And in an ideal world, they are young as well and not 35. \u201cFrom time to time you have to take some risk and we will see. I have no idea what will happen but I am positive about it. If in the end it is not positive, then I can start worrying, but I just think everything will be fine.\u201d  Klopp believes potential investors will be attracted by Liverpool\u2019s global stature and the prospect of buying into a stable club with a young generation of talent coming through. \u201cThat is my feeling as well,\u201d he replied when asked whether Liverpool, with Anfield\u2019s redevelopment to be completed next year and a new training ground in place, were positioned to achieve more success. \u201cWe are not in the table like it should be, so the football could be more stable, but the club itself is incredibly stable. The stuff we put together in the last years is outstanding. \u201cWe have a coaching staff and manager who have committed long term, all really stable, and everybody is on fire. This club is already one of the biggest in the world but we have to keep going. Setbacks are normal but when you are stable you can go from there again and that is what is going through my mind.\u201d Klopp will miss Liverpool\u2019s final Premier League game before the winter break, at home to Southampton on Saturday, after being handed an immediate one-match suspension by the Football Association.  The FA successfully appealed against the \u00a330,000 fine originally imposed on Klopp, arguing the punishment was too lenient. Klopp was dismissed for haranguing the assistant referee, Gary Beswick, in the closing minutes of Liverpool\u2019s 1-0 win over Manchester City on 16 October. Liverpool are understood to be disappointed by the decision but accept the outcome, with Klopp having already admitted to a charge of improper conduct. The club are also unhappy with an appeal process that led to their manager being banned within 24 hours of kick-off."

                    "body": "Good morning. Last year, the Cop26 climate summit in Glasgow kept alive the target of holding global temperatures to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels; but, conference president Alok Sharma said, \u201cits pulse is weak\u201d. The vital question for the Cop27 summit at Sharm-el-Sheikh in Egypt, which began yesterday, is whether it will prove to be an emergency room or a hospice. If Cop27 is to have any chance of renewing global commitments after a year of extremely limited progress, the work of the negotiators who will take over once world leaders have departed at the end of today will be crucial. I spoke to the Guardian\u2019s environment correspondent Fiona Harvey about the fascinating, byzantine, surprisingly dramatic and extremely nerdy process of climate diplomacy \u2013 and why, as deeply frustrating as it might be, it matters so much. That\u2019s after the headlines. And a quick note to say that I\u2019m off the rest of this week \u2013 Nimo and recurring guest star Dan Milmo will be in your inbox. Five big stories  Economy | Jeremy Hunt will announce \u00a325bn worth of tax rises and \u00a335bn in spending cuts at the autumn statement, the Guardian understands. The scale of the measures has grown significantly after the Bank of England\u2019s dire forecasts last week of the longest recession since the 1930s. Ukraine | The Biden administration has reportedly warned Kyiv that allies\u2019 \u201cUkraine fatigue\u201d could worsen if Volodymyr Zelenskiy continues to be closed to negotiations with Russia. Climate crisis | An assessment by Carbon Brief has found the US, UK and Canada have fallen billions of dollars short of their \u201cfair share\u201d of climate funding for low-income countries. This comes after the UN\u2019s World Meteorological Organization said the past eight years were the eight hottest ever recorded, putting the internationally agreed 1.5C limit for global heating \u201cbarely within reach\u201d. Politics | Rishi Sunak is facing further questions over his political judgment after it emerged he was made aware of a complaint against his political ally Gavin Williamson before appointing him. Sunak was said to have been unaware of the contents of hostlile texts sent to former chief whip Wendy Morton. Housing | More than 138,000 properties in England and Wales are owned by offshore companies. In London the offshore holdings are worth as much as \u00a355bn.  In depth: \u2018It\u2019s awful and frustrating \u2013 but you can\u2019t solve the climate crisis without Cop\u2019  There are \u201cperiods of intense activity and huge longueurs\u201d at climate summits, says Fiona Harvey in Sharm-el-Sheikh; happily, I reach her during one of the longueurs. She emphasises that this is not a \u201cdecision summit\u201d like Glasgow. Instead, the focus will be on holding countries accountable for their commitments last year against the backdrop of the global energy crisis brought about by Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. In this piece from May, UN climate adviser Rachel Kyte describes the task as \u201cimplementation, implementation, implementation\u201d. \u201cWe won\u2019t get an agreement or a new treaty at the end of it,\u201d Fiona said. \u201cBut it\u2019s incredibly important we see progress.\u201d This piece explains why it\u2019s looking so tough, while this one sets out the vital importance of \u201closs and damage\u201d financing for developing nations \u2013 which was finally confirmed as part of the agenda for the talks after \u201cfractious\u201d discussions that dragged late into the night and delayed the opening of the conference proper. In the Guardian\u2019s Down to Earth newsletter (sign up here for twice-weekly updates throughout Cop27), Fiona writes: \u201cThis year\u2019s Cop will be arguably the hardest yet.\u201d The only path to success is through the endless minutiae of negotiation \u2013 \u201ca lot of horrible absurdity\u201d, Fiona said. \u201cPeople arguing in rooms for hours.\u201d Here\u2019s how it works. *** What is the framework for the summit?  \u201cThe first two days are about world leaders being there and having their photos taken and talking,\u201d Fiona said. \u201cAfter that, the negotiators get on with it. In the second week, next Tuesday, we get the \u2018high-level segment\u2019 \u2013 that\u2019s when ministers join the talks.\u201d All Cop summits take place under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, a treaty agreed almost 30 years ago. Everything that happens in Sharm-el-Sheikh \u2013 \u201cthe fact of the meeting, setting the agenda, the texts agreed at the end of it\u201d \u2013 is a product of the UNFCCC. \u201cIt was a massive achievement,\u201d Fiona said. \u201cIt is full of frustrations, but you can\u2019t redraw it now \u2013 you just wouldn\u2019t get people to sign up to it. The important thing is that it means that once things are agreed, countries have a legal obligation to see them through.\u201d *** Who are the negotiators? Countries are represented individually, but blocs of nations with common interests \u2013 like the Africa Group, the Least Developed Countries, and the Small Island Developing States \u2013 seek to increase their negotiating power by clubbing together. \u201cThe big countries have teams of negotiators who do nothing all year round but these talks,\u201d Fiona said. \u201cThey will have someone in every workstream, in every room. The poorer ones can\u2019t do that \u2013 they will send one country to one event, another to another, and compare notes.\u201d For a sense of what it\u2019s like negotiating on behalf of those most vulnerable to the impact of the climate crisis, see this riveting fly-on-the-wall account of the work of Giza Gaspar-Martins, chair of the Least Developed Countries group at the Paris summit in 2015. He dashes from meeting to meeting across the impractically vast site, pausing only to \u201ctalk to my wife\u201d (smoke a cigarette) and \u201cdo the things I cannot delegate\u201d (go to the loo). *** What do they negotiate over? \u201cIt\u2019s hilarious on one level, awful on another,\u201d Fiona said. \u201cIt just sounds incomprehensible to anyone outside of this bizarre bubble. There are non-papers, \u2018informal informals\u2019, acres of square brackets, rows about the placements of semicolons. They sit for hours hammering it all out.\u201d But these arcane points really matter. As Giza Gaspar-Martins says of a draft of the final Paris agreement: \u201cWe need to do some detective work. Some good brains have been working hard to hide things in here.\u201d Also in Paris, a last-minute row over whether a \u201cshall\u201d ought to have been a \u201cshould\u201d was only resolved with the dubious claim that a \u201ctypographical error\u201d had been made, allowing the US to overlook a stronger commitment than it wanted on mitigation efforts in the final text. (Here\u2019s a terrific account of that drama by the Guardian\u2019s then-environment editor John Vidal.) In Glasgow, Alok Sharma fought back tears as he apologised to delegates over a late change, forced by China and India, changed a commitment to \u201cphase out\u201d coal to the looser promise to \u201cphase down\u201d its use. \u201cDid I appreciate we had to adjust one thing tonight in a very unusual way?\u201d John Kerry said afterwards. \u201cNo. But if we hadn\u2019t done that, we wouldn\u2019t have a deal.\u201d *** How do these agreements get reached? The country holding the presidency \u2013 Egypt this year \u2013 will assign countries responsibility for managing negotiations over particular areas. \u201cThere\u2019s an \u2018ad hoc working group\u2019 for every key part of the process that will meet in their own little rooms,\u201d Fiona said. \u201cSo the Cop president will say on climate finance, for example, let\u2019s have one developed and one developing country go away and convene other countries for talks.\u201d Also helpful, Fiona added, is the way the summit allows for accidental interactions of key players. \u201cThis is the only forum which puts the developing countries on a somewhat level playing field,\u201d she said. \u201cThey can catch a minister from an EU nation in a corridor, and say, with moral authority, \u2018come on, mate\u2019. That\u2019s important.\u201d None of this is very glamorous. Pictures abound from previous Cops of windowless shoeboxes with uncomfortable looking chairs shoehorned around a table covered in cold pizza and heavily annotated drafts. But it\u2019s necessary work ahead of the final stage of discussions in the plenary session, which all countries attend. *** How does the text get finally agreed? One criticism of the consensus model of the Cop summits \u2013 which sees the text agreed in a final session involving every country \u2013 is that it enforces the \u201cwill of the laggards\u201d: the argument is that is easy for countries that are reluctant to adopt crucial climate change measures to put a spanner in the works. \u201cThat\u2019s not really fair,\u201d said Fiona. \u201cThey don\u2019t get their own way all the time \u2013 they didn\u2019t in Glasgow or Paris. Saudi Arabia and Russia are happy to be the people in closed rooms making criticisms, but they don\u2019t want to put themselves out there like that. So the process of consensus can force the laggards to catch up, and it outs those who won\u2019t agree.\u201d She points to the example of Durban 2011, where the treaty that became the Paris agreement was born. \u201cEveryone was on board except China and India, and the EU forced a showdown \u2013 the talks went on for days, and in the end the EU called out China and India, and said, are you going to stand up? And they didn\u2019t.\u201d Does all of this add up to a process that meets the vast crisis already under way? Hardly. \u201cYou sit there and you talk about five-year review processes \u2013 we haven\u2019t got five bloody years,\u201d Fiona said. \u201cBut while Cop won\u2019t solve the climate crisis, you can\u2019t solve the climate crisis without Cop. It\u2019s awful and inadequate and frustrating, but it\u2019s still essential. These discussions are incredibly important because they\u2019re the only discussions we\u2019ve got.\u201d What else we\u2019ve been reading  Aaron Carter, the teen heartthrob of the noughties, was just 34 when he died this Saturday.

                    "body": "Good morning. As winter arrives in Ukraine, sleet and snow will become a daily fact of life. Depending on the severity of the weather, the ground will become impassably muddy, or freeze over. Civilians in parts of the country will be left without power, heating or water as a result of Russian attacks on infrastructure, and could face frostbite, hypothermia and pneumonia. Temperatures will get as low as -20C. While the months ahead look grim, the question of how these drastically changing conditions will impact the progress of the war is more complicated. For today\u2019s newsletter, I spoke to Julian Borger, reporting for the Guardian from Kyiv, about how both sides will hope to use the circumstances to their advantage \u2013 and how the prospects for diplomacy could be shaped by the facts on the ground. Here are the headlines. Five big stories  China | Hundreds of demonstrators and police have clashed in Shanghai as protests over China\u2019s stringent Covid restrictions flared for a third day and spread to several cities. The BBC said its accredited reporter Ed Lawrence was beaten when he was detained by police in Shanghai for several hours. NHS | Brexit has worsened the UK\u2019s acute shortage of doctors in key areas of care and led to more than 4,000 European doctors choosing not to work in the NHS, new research reveals. The NHS in England alone has vacancies for 10,582 physicians. Labour | Keir Starmer has categorically ruled out the return of free movement between Britain and the EU if he were to become prime minister, despite supporting the policy three years ago. Transport | One of the north of England\u2019s main railway companies, the TransPennine Express, has been using an \u201coutrageous\u201d legal loophole to significantly underreport cancellations. Trains preemptively cancelled up to 10pm the night before are not included in official statistics, turning a rate of 20-30% to reported figures as low as 5.6%. Television | Former health secretary Matt Hancock finished third on I\u2019m a Celebrity ... Get Me Out of Here!, with retired footballer Jill Scott the eventual winner. Hancock, who lost the Tory whip over his appearance, was left with a toad sitting on his head at the end of the final challenge, \u201cFlood Your Face\u201d.  In depth: \u2018Winter will bring fairly heavy attrition with death and illness\u2019  *** The situation today: \u2018stop-go phases to the conflict\u2019 To date, the Pentagon estimates that around 100,000 Russian soldiers have been killed or wounded during the war, and about the same number of Ukrainian troops. Around 40,000 civilians are also thought to have died. That devastating toll continues to grow, but \u201cthere are real stop-go phases to the conflict now\u201d, Julian Borger said. While Ukrainian troops have been in the ascendancy for some time, \u201cafter the Russians made the decision to abandon Kherson and regroup on the left bank of the river Dnipro, we are in a slower phase\u201d. If Ukraine is to continue its counter-offensive in the south, its forces could attempt to advance in neighbouring Zaporizhzhia oblast, where it already holds the left bank of the Dnipro. \u201cZaporizhzhia may be the next focus. But the pace of the conflict isn\u2019t by any means uniform,\u201d Julian said. And, as weather worsens, what happens next may be decided in part by forces beyond the control of either side. *** The front: will the ground be muddy or frozen? Biden administration officials expect the winter months to bring \u201ca slowdown in military advances on both sides\u201d that could last as long as six months, the New York Times reported earlier this month \u2013 though that is not a universal view. In a 10 November assessment, the respected US thinktank the Institute for the Study of War (ISW) said that it \u201cdoes not assess the fighting in Ukraine will halt or enter a stalemate due to winter weather, despite faulty western assumptions\u201d. The ISW says it expects that \u201cwell-supplied Ukrainian forces are unlikely to halt their counteroffensives due to the arrival of winter weather\u201d. In the short term, the ISW said on Saturday, the pace of operations has slowed in recent days because of bad weather but is likely to accelerate as the ground freezes because of a forecast temperature drop this week. To a large extent, the nature of the conflict on the front lines will continue to depend on the severity of the weather. \u201cIf it\u2019s really boggy, you can\u2019t go anywhere with armour,\u201d Julian said. \u201cThat was the thinking behind the original invasion \u2013 Russia went in February at one of the coldest points because of worries about what muddy terrain would mean north of Kyiv.\u201d But while frozen ground would make equipment more manoeuvrable for both sides, very cold weather would also be punishing for poorly supplied and inexperienced Russian troops. \u201cNothing could be worse than being a Russian conscript sent to the front,\u201d Julian said. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen footage of them camping outside, in very thin tents \u2013 it\u2019s miserable. And you would imagine winter will bring fairly heavy attrition with death and illness.\u201d *** Russia\u2019s response: \u2018freeze Ukraine to death\u2019 If there is a slowdown at the front, Russia will seek to use the pause to mobilise those 300,000 conscripts, whatever the cost, and hope to bring into play the Iranian missiles that they have ordered to replenish their depleted stocks. \u201cWe don\u2019t know if those are in Russia yet,\u201d Julian said. The other part of their strategy appears to be \u201cto freeze Ukraine to death\u201d, Julian said. Russia is attacking Ukrainian energy infrastructure and may intensify its assault on the country\u2019s water supply, with both power and water out in 15 regions including Kyiv last week. Nato countries are stepping up the delivery of power transformers and electricity generators in response. On Thursday, Julian wrote, 70% of Kyiv was without power, and \u201cthere was water everywhere, but very little to drink\u201d. The severity of that approach is also apparent in Kherson, as reported in this piece by Lorenzo Tondo and Isobel Khoshiw: they write that civilians are gathering firewood but have been warned not to head into the woods without consulting the military \u201cbecause Russian troops may have left behind mines, tripwires and unexploded shells\u201d. But, they add: \u201cWith the price of firewood rising, many have no choice but to take the risk. If a mine doesn\u2019t kill them, the cold might.\u201d *** Ukraine\u2019s response: press advantage, maintain morale  Ukraine wants to maintain the momentum of its recent battlefield successes for as long as it can. The head of Ukraine\u2019s national security and defence council, Oleksiy Danilov, was \u201cabsolutely insistent that the weather isn\u2019t an issue and they will press on\u201d, Julian said of a conversation with the official last week. Ukraine may be less hampered by the winter because its supply lines are shorter than Russia\u2019s. If there is a pause, \u201cthat will arguably allow them to regroup and re-arm faster than the Russians if they can keep the flows of equipment coming from the west\u201d, Julian said \u2013 pointing in particular to air defence systems needed to blunt Russian attacks on infrastructure. Western analysts also expect an increase in sabotage operations, and even targeted assassinations, behind Russian lines. The other key question for Ukrainians is whether widespread opposition to a negotiated peace will persist. \u201cThe stories we\u2019re writing are not about smiley, happy people defying Putin,\u201d Julian said. \u201cBut it is almost impossible to imagine an upswell in demand for some kind of peace deal with territory given away. The kind of punishment meted out by the Russians will be miserable, but they know who to blame.\u201d As one Kyiv resident told him last week: \u201cDo you remember the siege of Leningrad? They lived through that and we can live through this. We can live through anything.\u201d *** Will there be new pressure for talks? Earlier this month, General Mark Milley, the chairman of the US joint chiefs of staff, said the winter would present a \u201ca window of opportunity for negotiations\u201d \u2013 and while he later walked those remarks back, \u201cit shows that that view is out there in Washington\u201d, Julian said. \u201cThe Ukrainians very vehemently reject that.\u201d In an analysis published by the thinktank Rusi last week, Jack Watling and Nick Reynolds wrote that while some western allies were pressurising Kyiv to consider negotiating a truce, that would be \u201ctactically advantageous for Russia in stabilising its control over the occupied territories\u201d and was unlikely to end Russia\u2019s ambition of subjugating Ukraine. Even if Milley\u2019s remarks do not represent the view of the Biden administration at the moment, the Republican party\u2019s control of the House of Representatives after the midterm elections may change the calculus, Julian said. \u201cBiden is getting a lot of aid out of the door during this lame duck session. I think the balance of views is that those in the Republican party who would end support are not dominant, but there is a question mark. At the moment, the single biggest worry for Ukraine\u2019s ability to wage this war is the politics in Washington.\u201d What else we\u2019ve been reading  Bethan McKernan spoke to entrepreneur Rasha Khouri and Palestinian chef Fadi Kattan about their new restaurant, Akub, which focuses on bringing the essence of Palestinian food to London. \u201cThat\u2019s really what I want this to be,\u201d says Khouri, \u201ca celebration of the nuances of Palestinian food and cooking and heritage.\u201d Nimo Claire Armitstead\u2019s piece for the Observer about the contested present and surprising history of pronouns is a fascinating, vital account of how a \u201cgrammatical convenience\u201d became \u201cso much more than that\u201d.

In the early 20th century, European archeologists relied on the work of teams of Kenyan excavators to find ancient monuments during archeological digs. The white scholars would then write books on these digs, taking sole credit without mentioning the dozens of native people whose expert local knowledge about the ancient sites had led to the discoveries. It was a common colonial practice to \u201cforget\u201d the crucial contributions of Africans to uncovering their own history. To rectify this, exhibitions which are due to take place in museums in Mombasa and London, are showing unseen photographs of previously nameless and faceless people that place them at these digs. The photographs are a key part of correcting historical records and will hopefully begin the process of giving these excavators their deserved recognition.

Both sets of travelling fans will make it because they always do (though some might not make it back given the last trains home will have long gone), and it is no doubt on this blind loyalty that the Premier League and various TV networks count as they dither over which matches to show and when.

                    "body": "I think the Ireland rugby union captain and head coach, Johnny Sexton and Andy Farrell, have a valid point about lowering the tackle height to the waist, a variable anatomical landmark (Johnny Sexton criticises RFU for lowering tackle height for amateurs, 23 January).  My experience includes playing amateur schools rugby at a high level in Ireland and being the doctor for Launceston Rugby Club and Cornwall RFU. (This included time when Launceston were at a high level, playing professional teams.) I have seen the game get faster, more physical, and sometimes indisciplined. As a doctor, I am most concerned about the risks of long-term neurological damage. As a spectator, I love to see good, open rugby. Having studied and taught anatomy, could I suggest a better option: all rugby shirts should have a clear horizontal line at the level of the junction between the upper, backward angled section of the breastbone (the sternum) and the lower, long part. Then every player, from child to veteran, could see that line and tackle below it. This would give more clarity to match officials. I believe this would reduce head and neck injuries.Dr Danny LangDeal, Kent \u2022 I have followed the debate about rugby tackling height rules with interest (RFU\u2019s Bill Sweeney facing calls to resign over tackle height rule-change debacle, 27 January). At my boys\u2019 secondary school in 1960s Middlesbrough, our one hour per week PE lesson used to alternate between football and rugby. The first 15 minutes of the latter was tackling practice, and involved one of us \u2013 selected randomly \u2013 standing side-on at the end of the gym while, one at a time, the other 30 would charge from the other end and launch themselves horizontally to hit you in the middle of the thigh with their shoulder. Any tackle higher or lower was called as a foul. It was easy to spot who had been the tackle \u201ctarget\u201d the next day, as they always had an angry bruise visible under their shorts. Not surprisingly, we all preferred football weeks.Andrew KeeleyWarrington, Cheshire \u2022 With reference to the RFU\u2019s decision to lower the legal tackle height at amateur level, in the 1930s, when WH Auden wrote the school song for Raynes Park county grammar, he recognised in verse three that tackling high was unmanly, which remained the case for many years: \u201cMan has mind but body also; / So we learn to tackle low / Bowl the off-breaks, hit the sixes, / Bend the diver\u2019s brilliant bow.\u201d When did it become unfashionable to be taught otherwise?Michael BurnsNew Malden, London \u2022 Thank you for your reporting on the growing concern about brain injuries affecting rugby players (Amateur players launch lawsuit against rugby authorities over brain injuries, 19 January). As a spectator of international and club rugby, I feel increasingly conflicted that the entertainment that I have enjoyed watching in the stands and on TV may have contributed to players developing neurodegenerative diseases. Injuries are part of a contact sport like rugby, but brain injuries that lead to young men and women not being able to live normal lives after retirement from the sport are not acceptable. Short of boycotting the game altogether, what should supporters do to put pressure on rugby authorities to make it safer?Ian ColtartThoiry, France"

                    "body": "The end of Formiga\u2019s career is in sight but her battle will not be over then. The 43-year-old is the only player (male or female) to have played in seven World Cups and seven Olympics and while she is still playing club football for S\u00e3o Paulo she is also aware that there is a job to be done once she stops playing. Formiga is known as the indefatigable player of Brazilian women\u2019s football. She has always talked about her commitment to the sport and how she has taken care of herself to enjoy such longevity on the pitch. Now, though, her voice is starting to become as prominent as her game.  \u201cI was always really reserved,\u201d she tells the Guardian before revealing that for every year that passed she became more and more aware of the importance of what she represented as a black, lesbian footballer. \u201cWe now have the freedom and respect of people who admire our work \u2013 and that gives me the confidence to speak up.\u201d Formiga has suffered prejudice throughout her career and that has made her wary of public attention. But with growing support towards women\u2019s football, she feels that the world is now a safer space to share pictures and videos of herself and her wife, Erica, and to talk about her race and sexuality to the media. By doing so, she hopes to inspire others. \u201cI believe there are girls that may still be afraid to come out,\u201d she says. \u201cWhen we show our lives to people, we can also inspire a family member to think differently, and that they can accept their children the way they are. What we really hope and wish for is to have 100% respect. That we can go anywhere without prejudice, to restaurants and cinemas, that we can be seen with good eyes, because like it or not, we\u2019re doing good for each other.\u201d For most of her life Miraildes Maciel Mota had to deal with many challenges, not only related to the attitudes towards her being an athlete but also because of her sexuality. There has been a rise in awareness towards the LGBTQ+ population in Brazil and their rights but there is still a lot of violence. \u201cI\u2019m not saying that this prejudice is over. But there\u2019s no way for us to hide any more,\u201d she says. \u201cWe live in a different era.  \u201cWhen I started playing football we didn\u2019t have the protection we have today. Back then people\u2019s minds were really bad. Now we live in a different era, in a new world. So I think we need to show ourselves and earn the respect that didn\u2019t exist before.\u201d Even though Formiga has seen a lot of changes in Brazil, she wants more to be done. It is not only female footballers who are abused. Recently the Flamengo forward Gabriel Barbosa was the subject of racist abuse from Fluminense supporters. \u201cIt is extremely unfortunate that we still see these racist issues,\u201d Formiga says. \u201cIt should have been eradicated from society by now, not only in Brazil but in the rest of the world too. I think there needs to be stricter punishments for these attitudes so that it becomes a deterrent for people, a lesson that this can\u2019t happen any more. \u201cPeople need to respect other human beings, respect people who are doing some good things. It doesn\u2019t matter if some fans don\u2019t want to accept that another team is better but they need to see that they are human beings, that we are all the same, and we need to respect that. The law needs to improve, it needs to be stricter.\u201d  Formiga says she has felt the need to join fellow players in their battle to end discrimination in football. She believes the Brazilian FA (CBF) can do more and become a role model for other areas of the world. \u201cWe can become an inspiration for other countries, a reference,\u201d she says. \u201cThe football associations need to campaign [against the prejudices] all the time, as do players, not only from football but from all sports. There needs to be a joint effort to make sure that our law changes as quickly as possible so that we can deal with this. \u201cPeople need to be educated. Sometimes they don\u2019t see what their actions are doing to another person. So we can start something, together with the government and the justice system, to have more severe punishments to fight racism once and for all.\u201d When Formiga was born, in 1978, women\u2019s football was still banned by law in Brazil. That changed a year later and, four decades on, she knows her personal story is connected to the history of the women\u2019s game. She also feels she is worthy of people\u2019s respect because of her achievements.  The midfielder, who played an incredible 234 times for her country, was part of the most successful generation of Brazilian female players, winning two Olympic silver medals. She has played for years alongside legends such as Marta and Cristiane but for a long time it was not easy to know the real Formiga. She avoided the spotlight and only used the attention to ask for better support for her fellow players. Having played in Brazil, Sweden, the United States and France, she is now using her experience to advise younger players how to navigate their careers. \u201cI tell them to never stay in the comfort zone,\u201d she says. \u201cNothing is going to happen if they don\u2019t put the effort in or if they\u2019re not committed. I always wanted to encourage the girls I had the opportunity to play with so that they can believe in their potential and appreciate our sport at all times, because it is a constant struggle. We hold hands and keep fighting to improve the women\u2019s game worldwide. That way we can fight for equality, for our rights and to be more recognised every day.\u201d Formiga is content at the moment. She is happy to focus on her club and happy to consider everything that she has done. \u201cI feel fulfilled knowing that everything I do can change lives.\u201d"

                    "body": "Key Netball Australia sponsors have denied reports they are considering walking away from the code after Gina Rinehart\u2019s mining firm Hancock Prospecting pulled out of a $15m funding deal, because of player concerns about its record on Indigenous affairs. The saga over the mining billionaire\u2019s sponsorship of Netball Australia came to a head on Saturday after her company announced it was withdrawing from its $15m funding deal. It followed reports Indigenous player Donnell Wallam and her Australian Diamonds teammates had expressed discomfort about wearing the company\u2019s logo on their uniforms, due to concerns about its record on Indigenous issues. The decision to withdraw the funding \u2013 as well as sponsorship agreements with Netball Western Australia and the West Coast Fever team \u2013 is a severe blow to the code, which has suffered losses of more than $7m in two Covid-affected years.  Reports on Monday suggested other sponsors were considering pulling out, quoting anonymous sources suggesting the saga could cost the code an additional $10m. But major sponsors have confirmed they intend to stand by the sport. Principal sponsor Suncorp said it was \u201cvery proud\u201d to be associated with the sport. \u201cSuncorp is very proud of our longstanding principal partnership of Netball Australia, as the leading women\u2019s team sport in participation and our commitment to supporting the game from the grassroots community level through to Suncorp Super Netball, and the national Diamonds team,\u201d a company spokesperson said.  Sign up for our free morning newsletter and afternoon email to get your daily news roundup  \u201cAs a sponsor, Suncorp is not responsible for the sport\u2019s commercial and operational decisions that fall under Netball Australia\u2019s governance.\u201d Other major sponsors echoed those comments. Insurance firm HCF said it was \u201cproud\u201d of its partnership with the code, which had seen it \u201cempower those within the netball community to lead healthier, more active lives\u201d over the last four years. \u201cWe\u2019re proud of this partnership and are currently in commercial discussions with Netball Australia regarding future seasons of sponsorship,\u201d HCF said. Naming sponsor Origin Energy confirmed it would remain an active supporter.  Major sponsor Nissan said it recently extended its sponsorship for a further five years. \u201cWe are proud this support spans from grassroots to international competition for the biggest female sport in Australia,\u201d a spokesperson said. It comes as the head of the Netball Player\u2019s Association, Kathryn Harby-Williams, said a compromise had been struck between the code\u2019s governing body and the Diamonds prior to Hancock\u2019s decision. Harby-Williams told ABC\u2019s grandstand that the players had been willing to wear the company\u2019s logo on its uniforms during the Constellation Cup against New Zealand, which the Diamonds won on Sunday. \u201cWe had come to an agreement with Netball Australia where everyone was comfortable that would happen and that Donnell and the players would not be required to wear the logo against England in the three-match series starting shortly,\u201d Harby-Williams said. \u201cAt no point in time did the players seek to have the deal fall off the table but we were certainly willing to come to a compromise and had agreed to that shortly after the players stood by Donnell.\u201d  In two lengthy statements issued over the weekend, Hancock and Rinehart defended their record on Indigenous affairs, pointing to separate funding initiatives, saying it was \u201cunnecessary for sports organisations to be used as the vehicle for social or political causes\u201d. It said there were \u201cmore targeted and genuine ways to progress social or political causes without virtue signalling or for self-publicity\u201d. In 1984 Rinehart\u2019s father, Lang Hancock, the founder of Hancock Prospecting, suggested Indigenous Australians be sterilised to \u201cbreed themselves out\u201d. In the interview, Hancock said: \u201cThose that have been assimilated into, you know, earning [a] good living or earning wages amongst the civilised areas, those that have been accepted into society and they have accepted society and can handle society, I\u2019d leave them well alone\u201d. \u201cThe ones that are no good to themselves and can\u2019t accept things, the half-castes \u2013 and this is where most of the trouble comes \u2013 I would dope the water up so that they were sterile and would breed themselves out in future and that would solve the problem.\u201d"

Pogo also likes to race up with the pace, should get a good position from stall one, and his form behind Kinross \u2013 a 4-1 chance for this \u2013 in August suggests he should not be four times the price of Ralph Beckett\u2019s gelding, who is drawn in the parking lot in stall 13.\n\nWincanton 12.40 ITV Racing\u2019s 10-hour marathon could kick off with a win for Paul Nicholls\u2019s Sabrina, who gets 15lb from the unbeaten Lady Adare and has promising conditional Freddie Gingell taking off another 10lb.\nDoncaster 12.50 This Listed sprint looks tailor-made for the ultra-consistent Commanche Falls after a third-place finish at Group Three level last time.\nAintree 1.01 Gericault Roque reverts to hurdles after a solid chasing campaign last season and remains unexposed after just three starts over timber.\nWincanton 1.15 Useful hurdler McFabulous makes his chasing debut here but Sebastopol ran to a decent level several times last season and could well put his fencing experience to good use.\nDoncaster 1.30 Sweet Believer has form on heavy ground and looks overpriced at around 4-1 to beat the early favourite, Life Of Dreams.\nWincanton 1.50 Frodon is tricky to weigh up, as he goes well fresh but was a little underwhelming for much of last season. A wind op may help, but Lord Accord, a winner at Cheltenham last month, could be a more solid option.\nAintree 2.11 Lifetime Ambition ran to a high level when second in a Grade One in April and is feasibly weighted on that form.\nDown Royal 2.32 It will be interesting to see how Envoi Allen gets on stepping up to three miles but Galvin, with a race under his belt already this season, should get the better of his former stable companion.\nAintree 2.45 Dashel Drasher is better known as a chaser but has decent form over hurdles too and is likely to get his own way in front.\nWincanton 3.00 The progressive Knappers Hill is one to keep onside after shrugging off a big weight to win a valuable handicap at Chepstow last time.\nDoncaster 3.13 Cemhaan, a thorough stayer who acts on heavy ground, looks to have been saved for this by a shrewd yard and makes plenty of appeal at around 12-1.\nKeeneland 3.50 Ce Ce was a convincing winner of this race at Del Mar 12 months ago, has drawn well in stall four and is attractively priced at around 5-1 for a repeat.\nKeeneland 4.29 Europe\u2019s best sprinters have already succumbed to Highfield Princess at Group One level this season and she may well prove good enough to deny Golden Pal a third Breeders\u2019 Cup success.\n\nKeeneland 5.10 Cody\u2019s Wish made a successful step up to Grade One level last time and is a solid favourite to follow up.\nKeeneland 5.50 Nashwa heads the market for the Gosdens and Hollie Doyle but 6-4 looks short in such a competitive race. Joseph O\u2019Brien\u2019s Above The Curve is lightly-raced and still improving, and good value at around 5-1 to give her trainer a second win in four years in this race.\nKeeneland 6.30 A wide draw could make things a little trickier but the favourite, Jackie\u2019s Warrior, should have enough in hand.\n\nKeeneland 7.55 Nest, runner-up in the Kentucky Oaks in May, could edge out her stable-companion Malathaat in what looks like a Todd Pletcher head-to-head.\nKeeneland 8.40 Apart from a sub-par run in the Derby, Nations Pride has done little wrong this season and can give Charlie Appleby his second Turf win in a row.\nKeeneland 9.40 All eyes on Flightline as he bids for legend status and anything close to his astonishing dominance at Del Mar in September should be more than enough."

                    "body": "1) Games that should have been held last week The Premier League should not have postponed last weekend\u2019s fixtures. If people are working, it is wrong to confiscate their recreation, and that\u2019s before we consider fans who\u2019d taken time off or paid for transport in order to watch their team. Moreover, there are families relying on football-related income to pay bills and eat food who had their right to earn removed without warning, while cricket, rugby union and \u2013 among others \u2013 polo had the self-confidence to continue. Football is called the people\u2019s game because it was started for the people by the people \u2013 people who sought a bit of weekend fun to escape the drudgery of regular life and forget their place in the order of things, just for a few hours. The suits who\u2019ve expropriated it since would do well to remember that. Daniel Harris  2) Will Forest bounce back from embarrassment? Having allowed Bournemouth to come from two goals behind to beat them, Nottingham Forest face more fellow newcomers in Fulham as they attempt to halt a run of three consecutive defeats, the most recent of which was greeted by rare but audible booing from the City Ground stands. Despite playing without an out-and-out striker, Forest scored twice in the first half against Bournemouth but proved utterly unable to cope with Gary O\u2019Neil\u2019s half-time switch to a back three, when he replaced left-back Jordan Zemura with the more attack-minded wing-back Ryan Fredericks. Having had an extra week on the training ground to put things right and get a better idea of what constitutes his best XI, Steve Cooper will be expecting a reaction from his team in what should be an entertaining game between two attacking teams. With three of their following four games away from home, recent evidence suggests a failure to get one will be a source of worry for all concerned heading into the international break. Barry Glendenning  Nottingham Forest v Fulham, Friday 8pm (all times BST)  3) A possible Villa keeper conundrum Five years ago Filip Marschall hadn\u2019t even worn a pair of goalkeeping gloves but, if injuries do not abate as Steven Gerrard anticipates by the time Southampton visit Villa Park on Friday, then the 19-year-old could start between the sticks. Marschall joined Villa in 2018 from Cambridge City, for whom he played as a defender until the age of 13. Emi Mart\u00ednez missed training on Thursday owing to illness and Robin Olsen because of a knee problem, while Jed Steer is a long-term absentee with an achilles injury. Gerrard hopes Mart\u00ednez will be fit in time. Marschall was part of Gerrard\u2019s squad on Villa\u2019s pre-season trip to Australia and recently signed a new long-term contract, but the teenager who was on loan in the sixth tier with Gateshead last season could finish the weekend with a Premier League debut to his name. \u201cHe\u2019s prepared to be ready,\u201d Gerrard said. Ben Fisher  Aston Villa v Southampton, Friday 8pm   4) Costa to be let off Wolves\u2019 leash? The bar has been set. Wolves announced the signing of Diego Costa until the end of the season with a superb video of the chiselled striker keeping three snarling wolves, James, Alice and Gray, shackled and now Bruno Lage must ponder whether to let the 33-year-old off the leash. That clip has gone viral and Costa will be hoping to hit the ground running on his return to England, his last appearance coming for Chelsea in the 2017 FA Cup final defeat by Arsenal. Costa is working to a tailored training programme and said he required \u201ctwo or three weeks to get in shape\u201d, but Lage must be tempted to throw him in against Manchester City. \u201cIf I had ever doubted my potential, I wouldn\u2019t have accepted this challenge,\u201d Costa said this week. \u201cI can bring something to the table.\u201d BF  Wolves v Manchester City, Saturday 12.30pm  5) The highest of standards for City Picking holes in Manchester City and finding fault with Pep Guardiola are foolish things to do, given the former have won three of the last four league titles and the latter is an all-time great manager if he retires tomorrow or never claims another trophy. But the feeling persists that City could and should be even better than they are, not just in defence \u2013 a weak point in all Guardiola teams \u2013 but in attack. It may well be that Leroy San\u00e9 and Raheem Sterling had to be let go, but the fact remains that without them, City lack balance and speed. Of course, they are brilliant at compensating, whether through the rhythm of their passing or ability to conjure a goal out of nothing, but any team willing to stay narrow and defend with discipline and aggression have a chance at frustrating them \u2013 especially if, like Wolves, they also have pace on the counter. DHa  6) Howe urges Newcastle players to aim higher It took Newcastle until 30 November last year to reach the seven-point mark. After only six games they have arrived there this season, but have won only once \u2013 against Nottingham Forest at St James\u2019 Park \u2013 and Eddie Howe is not overjoyed. \u201cI\u2019m not happy, I want more points,\u201d said Newcastle\u2019s manager before giving his squad an apparently stern talking to about the need to achieve and maintain consistently high standards. Despite the likely absence through injury of two key creative players in Allan Saint-Maximin and Bruno Guimar\u00e3es, he will be particularly keen to beat Bournemouth at home on Saturday. Admiration for Howe on Tyneside currently knows few bounds, but the manager is aware Newcastle\u2019s Saudi Arabian owners have spent more than \u00a3200m on new players in less than a year and will feel entitled to see that investment translated into wins. Small wonder Howe is doing everything in his power to ensure his side do not stumble against the team he led to three promotions in six years, but who are still without a permanent manager. Louise Taylor  Newcastle United v Bournemouth, Saturday 3pm  7) Bees to test Arsenal durability Brentford Community Stadium will summon difficult memories for Arsenal, who suffered a chastening defeat there on the opening night of last season, even if it came with Covid-related caveats. Mikel Arteta\u2019s side are a different proposition now but the Bees feel more comfortable as an established top-flight unit, too, so the margins come Sunday lunchtime are likely to be fine. It will be a test for Arsenal\u2019s ability to bounce back after the slightly harsh 3-1 defeat at Old Trafford a fortnight previously, which ended their winning start but did not affect their status as league leaders. Victory this time would ensure they finish this weekend top of the pile and that would be handy given any pretensions at a title bid will be examined thoroughly in the subsequent home meetings with Spurs and Liverpool. Arsenal are about to see their durability scrutinised and would feel well set if they leave west London with three points. Nick Ames  Brentford v Arsenal, Sunday 12pm  8) Conte needs greater stability from Bissouma Antonio Conte intends to rotate his personnel for the visit of Leicester \u2013 after the mentally and physically draining Champions League defeat at Sporting on Tuesday \u2013 but it does not sound as if he is ready to call upon Yves Bissouma. It felt like a coup when Spurs took the Mali midfielder from Brighton for \u00a325m over the summer; here was a player that could add a new dimension in midfield, running with the ball, breaking the lines and creating chances. But it is not simple to play in the middle of Conte\u2019s 3-4-3 formation and the verdict so far on Bissouma, to quote the manager, is that he is \u201cstruggling a bit with the tactical aspect. With the ball he\u2019s really good; defensively he has to pay more attention.\u201d It goes a long way to explain why Bissouma has started only once and totalled 121 minutes in all competitions. He needs time to adapt. David Hytner  Tottenham v Leicester, Saturday 5.30pm   9) Time running out for Rodgers? Brendan Rodgers is an excellent coach \u2013 if you\u2019re not sure, just ask him \u2013 but it might be that he\u2019s running out of road at Leicester, who sit bottom with one point from six games, and travel to unbeaten, third-placed Tottenham this weekend. The malaise is not all his fault, as his board gave him little scope to reinforce this summer, citing FFP regulations and ground improvements as the reason. But it is hard to not to wonder if the pandemic was also influential, reduced travel meaning reduced duty-free income for the King Power group \u2013 a line the club would never speak in public, because who\u2019s going to excuse a parsimonious billionaire during a cost-of-living crisis? Rodgers, though, must also justify any funds allowed to him, which is to say it\u2019s time for him to coax or force tunes out of Patson Daka and Boubakary Soumar\u00e9, players bought amid fanfare last summer but who\u2019ve contributed little since. DHa 10) The importance of Calvert-Lewin Dominic Calvert-Lewin\u2019s status as Harry Kane\u2019s understudy looked secure in the England hierarchy 14 months ago, when he replaced the captain in the Euro 2020 quarter-final win over Ukraine. He has not played for the country since, and this week saw Brentford\u2019s in-form Ivan Toney named in Gareth Southgate\u2019s squad for England\u2019s final internationals before the World Cup. Qatar now appears a distant hope for the 25-year-old, who has been restricted to just 18 appearances for Everton since winning his last cap due to toe, thigh and knee injuries. Frank Lampard has been desperate for Calvert-Lewin\u2019s presence all season and, despite signing Neal Maupay, claimed the centre-forward\u2019s return diminished the need to add another striker in the transfer window. Goals remain a serious problem for a team without a Premier League win this season but, having resumed training during the enforced break, Calvert-Lewin should soon have opportunity to repay his manager\u2019s faith and perhaps send a late message to Southgate.

                    "body": "Across the battlefields of the Middle East, the ground is shifting. New alliances mitigate old enmities. Revised calculations of national advantage, evolving priorities and cautious diplomatic bridge-building conjure tantalising hopes of peace on multiple fronts. But change driven by fear has shallow roots. And fear, rather than faith in any wider vision, still permeates this contested landscape. The context, as ever, is a great power struggle between a newly aggressive Russia, an expansionist China, and a US determined to get back in the game. Growing security and economic alignment between Israel and the Arab states is one of the most spectacular shifts. Benny Gantz, Israel\u2019s defence minister, has confirmed the creation of a regional military alliance to deter Iran\u2019s missile and drone attacks. The US-backed pact reportedly involves the UAE, Bahrain, Jordan and Egypt, plus Qatar and Saudi Arabia, with which Israel has no formal diplomatic relations. It builds on the 2020 Abraham accords between Israel and four Arab countries, including Sudan and Morocco. Rapprochement is also fuelled by shared concern about Tehran\u2019s presumed nuclear weapons ambitions. It will gain added impetus in July when US president Joe Biden visits Israel and Saudi Arabia and comes as nuclear talks with Iran teeter on the brink of collapse. Biden\u2019s planned meeting with Mohammed bin Salman, the Saudi crown prince whom he deemed a \u201cpariah\u201d after the 2018 murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, is already attracting sharp criticism. This supposedly pragmatic act of realpolitik marks another stunning shift.  Biden will encourage normalisation of Israel-Saudi relations and seek to ease Palestinian tensions \u2013 he is due to visit the occupied West Bank. But fundamentally, the visit, his first to the Middle East as president, is intended to reassert US influence after the neglect of the Trump years. Russia\u2019s attack on Ukraine provides crucial context. Biden will press the Saudis and other producers to raise oil output to ease the global energy crisis and reduce Moscow\u2019s revenues. He remains mindful meanwhile of his other big overseas challenge: containing China, Russia\u2019s strategic ally and Iran\u2019s oil buddy. \u201cIf Biden reduces the war in Ukraine to a mere geopolitical struggle, the autocrats of the world will have cause to rejoice,\u201d warned Kenneth Roth of Human Rights Watch. \u201cThey will argue that democracies proclaim their values but then sell them for a cheaper tank of gas.\u201d The visit has big implications for Yemen and Syria, too. Ending the Yemen war, which produced the world\u2019s worst humanitarian emergency after the 2015 Saudi intervention against Iran-backed rebels, is a key Biden aim. The hope is that Salman will make permanent the current truce there. In what would be another big shift, the US may also offer economic incentives to a second pariah, Bashar al-Assad, in an attempt to counter Russian influence in Syria. They could even include an easing of sanctions to help Damascus to import Iranian oil.  That prospect links to another tantalising possibility: a last-gasp rescue of the nuclear pact with Iran. Indirect Iran-US talks in Qatar last week flopped. But Tehran, desperate for sanctions relief even as it develops its nuclear capabilities, insists agreement is still possible. Leading Israeli military figures now reportedly argue, contrary to the stance taken by the past and possible future prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu, that a bad Iran deal is better than no deal at all. And the US has an added incentive. Agreement could treble the amount of Iranian oil on global markets. Watching Biden, Vladimir Putin is waging a parallel influence campaign. Russia\u2019s president last week made his first trip abroad since the Ukraine invasion, meeting Iran\u2019s anti-western president, Ebrahim Raisi, in Turkmenistan. According to the Kremlin, Putin applauded a rapid expansion of bilateral trade since 24 February. \u201cWe have truly deep, strategic relations \u2026 and are working in such hotspots as Syria,\u201d he told Raisi. Like China, Russia has refused to condemn Iran\u2019s recent blocking of UN-run nuclear inspections. As usual, Iran\u2019s intentions appear opaque and contradictory. Alarmed by the new Arab-Israeli military alliance, it is flirting with a truly seismic geopolitical shift of its own: detente with Saudi Arabia, its great rival. Tehran said last week it was ready to resume Iraqi-mediated direct talks. While improbable at this stage, a defusing of nuclear and Iran-Saudi tensions could have huge positive implications for Tehran\u2019s ties with Europe, the US and all its Arab neighbours. If it reduced Middle East instability and discouraged Russian and Chinese encroachment, it would be doubly welcome in Washington. Yet the prospect of Iran\u2019s rehabilitation is an alarming one for Israel. It continues to view Tehran as an existential threat, particularly through its support for Hezbollah in Lebanon and Hamas in Gaza. Israel continues to assassinate regime figures and attack Iran\u2019s facilities, and recently intensified its so-called \u201cshadow war\u201d in Syria. This potentially puts it at odds with Biden\u2019s agenda. Whatever hopeful outcomes may or may not emerge as regional sands shift, it\u2019s already clear there will be plenty of losers. They include the Kurds of northern Syria, beset by an overbearing Turkish regime unchecked by Washington, and the independence fighters of Western Sahara.  Democracy campaigners who deplore Biden\u2019s Khashoggi volte-face will also point to countless other victims of serial human rights abuses by western-backed Middle East autocrats and dictators. But it\u2019s the Palestinians who stand to lose most from a partial, highly selective \u201cpeace in our time\u201d. Abandoned by Arab allies, manipulated by Iran, patronised by the US, ignored by wartime Europe, divided among themselves and preyed upon by the Israeli state, the cause of Palestinian independence has never looked bleaker. Times are changing. But Palestine\u2019s betrayal is timeless.  Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

                    "body": "Facing the two-time defending champion Tampa Bay Lightning put the Colorado Avalanche at a sizeable experience disadvantage going into the Stanley Cup final.  When the puck dropped, the Avalanche showed they could use their speed to offset Tampa Bay\u2019s players who have been here, done that. And it doesn\u2019t hurt to have a guy who also hoisted the Cup. Andr\u00e9 Burakovsky scored 1:23 into overtime to give Colorado a 4-3 victory in Game 1 on Wednesday night and put the Avs up in a series that\u2019s shaping up to be a classic. Burakovsky is one of only two Colorado players with Stanley Cup rings, and that came in handy. \u201cI\u2019ve been there, and I kind of know the situation,\u201d said Burakovsky, who also scored two big goals in Game 7 of the East final against the Lightning in 2018 when he won it all with Washington. \u201cI\u2019ve been though it, and I kind of know what to expect and the pace and what\u2019s at stake here.\u201d  The pace? Furious. The stakes? Either Tampa Bay finishing off the first NHL three-peat in almost four decades or this Colorado core\u2019s first championship after years of playoff disappointments. The Avalanche with a fast start how they can use their speed to knock even the most seasoned opponents back on their heels. Backstopped by Darcy Kuemper, the no-doubt after all choice to start in goal now that he\u2019s healthy, the penalty kill was aggressive in going a perfect 3 for 3 against the Lightning\u2019s potent power play. \u201cWe had a great forecheck and we were pretty good on clearing pucks when we had the chance,\u201d forward Artturi Lehkonen said. An early penalty kill built momentum for Colorado, which opened the scoring on captain Gabriel Landeskog\u2019s goal 40 seconds after Josh Manson\u2019s penalty expired. Manson \u2013 one of general manager Joe Sakic\u2019s expensive trade deadline pickups \u2013 more than made up for a holding the stick minor with several big hits. Lehkone, the Avalanche\u2019s other deadline acquisition, also kept up his knack for scoring key goals. He had their third goal of the first period after Valeri Nichuskin scored the second as part of a dominant performance all over the ice. \u201cHuge X-factor,\u201d coach Jared Bednar said. \u201cHe\u2019s been doing that type of thing for us for a couple years now.\u201d  Tampa Bay\u2019s latest additions also played a major role, with Nick Paul outracing Colorado defenseman Jack Johnson to a loose puck for a goal in the first that limited the damage and kept the defending champs in the game. Brandon Hagel, who has been banged up and was a question mark to play, got beaten to a loose puck by Landeskog, an uncharacteristic goal for reigning playoff MVP Andrei Vasilevskiy to give up by letting the initial shot sneak through under his left arm. Of course, the Lightning counterpunched. In another example of what has made the Lightning the NHL\u2019s best team over the past three years, they turned the tide in the second period with goals by Ondrej Palat and Mikhail Sergachev 48 seconds apart. \u201cWe\u2019re playing a really good team and they\u2019re not going to roll over and lay back,\u201d Bednar said. \u201cThey\u2019re going to have push back.\u201d So did his Avalanche, clamping down with another big kill in the third period to finish what Landeskog called a \u201cresilient win.\u201d Colorado outshot Tampa Bay 38-23, and there was no argument from the losing side about the result of the series opener between two evenly matched opponents. \u201cThere\u2019s some positive signs for us in this game,\u201d Lightning coach Jon Cooper said. \u201cBut the right team won the game, so give them credit for pulling it out.\u201d The arena was rocking from the start of warmups for the first Stanley Cup final game in the city in 2001 \u2013 also the last year the Avalanche won the Stanley Cup, with Sakic serving as captain. Fans chanted, \u201cWe want the Cup!\u201d throughout the leadup and at times during the game, which was a showcase of the high-scoring hockey that has been the standard all season. Tampa Bay\u2019s most prolific goal-scorer from each of the past two title runs was back, with center Brayden Point returning to play his first game since injuring his right leg a month ago. Colorado has a series lead despite playing without forwards Nazem Kadri (right thumb) and Andrew Cogliano (right hand), who were injured last series in a sweep of Edmonton in the Western Conference final. The Avalanche swept Nashville in the first round, as well, and dispatched rival St Louis in six before taking out Connor McDavid and the Oilers. If anything, Game 1 against the Lightning showed this series won\u2019t be easy for either team. \u201cI don\u2019t think by a country mile we gave them our best game,\u201d Cooper said. \u201cTo beat a team like that, we need to have better in us.\u201d"

                    "body": "Two unexpected figures \u2013 one a famed international, the other a journeyman goalkeeper \u2013 played the pivotal roles in helping the Los Angeles Football Club win its first Major League Soccer championship. Reserve goalkeeper John McCarthy stopped two penalty kicks as LAFC won MLS Cup 2022 by defeating the Philadelphia Union on penalties, 3-0, Saturday in front of 22,384 at the Banc of California Stadium. Both teams played to a 3-3 draw following 90 minutes of regulation and 30 of extra time. McCarthy entered the game in the second half of extra time after starting goalkeeper Maxime Crepeau received a red card. As a result of his unexpected efforts, McCarthy was named the game\u2019s most valuable player in just his third appearance this year. \u201cJohn is an excellent goalkeeper,\u201d LAFC coach Steve Cherundolo said. \u201cHe\u2019s the best number-two in the league. He could be a number-one elsewhere. He could be a number-one for us.\u201d McCarthy\u2019s heroics punctuated an emotional game featuring the dramatic and the unpredictable. \u201cFor 10, 15 minutes, it was like a Halloween movie,\u201d said LAFC forward Carlos Vela, one of two members of the original roster still with the team. \u201cThen we finished with a Hollywood (ending), like dreaming things, like something that you can\u2019t imagine can happen, does happen.\u201d Union coach Jim Curtin described that drama powerfully. \u201cI lived through the 130 minutes and I think I aged probably about five or six years,\u201d Curtin said about the combined amount of playing and added time. \u201cIt was chaotic. It was end-to-end. We were probably about two or three minutes away from lifting the MLS Cup trophy. I\u2019m gutted for our players.\u201d Making McCarthy\u2019s heroics possible was Gareth Bale, the former Tottenhan Hotspur and Real Madrid forward who will serve as Wales\u2019 captain during this month\u2019s World Cup. Bale scored the tying goal in stoppage time of the second overtime half, just four minutes after the Union took a 3-2 lead. \u201cIt\u2019s special,\u201d Bale said of the championship after two teammates doused him with champagne during the post-game press conference. \u201cThe reason why I came here was to try to help the club win a trophy and to win the MLS Cup. Obviously, they\u2019ve come close in the past but never got to the final and won it.\u201d Before this year, LAFC\u2019s biggest chance came in 2019, when the team won its first Supporters\u2019 Shield and tied a league record for most goals scored. But the Seattle Sounders beat LAFC in that year\u2019s conference final on the way to winning MLS Cup. Though Bale signed with LAFC on June 27, injuries limited him to just two goals in 12 regular season games. He had not played since Oct. 2 when he replaced Carlos Vela in the 97th minute. \u201cI\u2019m not 100% at the moment,\u201d Bale said. \u201cI haven\u2019t trained too much over the last three or four weeks. But we spoke about if I\u2019m needed for the last 20, 30 minutes, I\u2019m available.\u201d Bale\u2019s availability provided dividends in the 128th minute, when he headed Diego Palacios\u2019s left-wing cross into the net from seven yards while defender Jack Elliott tightly marked him. But four minutes earlier, Elliott appeared to give Philadelphia the championship. Kai Wagner sent a right-wing cross that hit LAFC\u2019s Ilie Sanchez in front of the goal. McCarthy deflected the ball but Elliott converted from two yards for his second goal of the game, culminating a rally from a 2-1 deficit. With the score tied, McCarthy went to work after Daniel Gazdag, the first of Philadelphia\u2019s penalty takers, launched his shot high over the crossbar. Gazdag tied for second among the league\u2019s regular-season scorers with 22 goals. Then McCarthy dived to his right to deflect Jose Martinez\u2019s shot at the left post. Next, he dived to his left to divert Wagner\u2019s attempt. \u201cI\u2019m not going to say I didn\u2019t have some type of idea,\u201d McCarthy said. \u201cLiterally, as I was sitting in the hot tub for pregame warming my body up, I watched a 9-minute clip of PK\u2019s.\u201d Denis Bouanga, Ryan Hollingshead and Sanchez converted for Los Angeles, with Sanchez\u2019s shot bouncing under diving goalkeeper Andre Blake to ensure the championship. Ironically, the 30-year-old McCarthy grew up in Philadelphia and played four seasons for the Union as a reserve before joining the United Soccer League\u2019s Tampa Bay Rowdies in 2019. McCarthy then spent the past two seasons with Inter Miami. \u201cI\u2019m a Philly kid through and through,\u201d he said. \u201cI grew up in Philly, went to grade school, high school, college. I know the people from that city. I know a lot of guys on that team, some of the fans. If we weren\u2019t in and Philly was in the final, I would for sure root for them.\u201d McCarthy replaced Crepeau in the 117th minute, when the starter received his red card. Crepeau charged off his line and slid out the penalty area to trip Philadelphia\u2019s Cory Burke on a breakaway. Both players went sprawling, and Crepeau had to leave the field on a motorized cart before being taken to the hospital. But while leaving, the Canadian international gave a \u201cthumbs up\u201d sign to the home fans. \u201cThese 911 moments as I call them are part of our game plan,\u201d Cherundolo said. \u201cWe tried to keep our larger stature players on the field for set pieces and crosses, and it worked.\u201d LAFC used Kellyn Acosta\u2019s 26-yard free kick in the 28th minute to move ahead, 1-0. After Martinez fouled Cristian Arango, Acosta\u2019s free kick ricocheted off the head of Philadelphia\u2019s Jack McGlynn, who leapt with the defensive wall. Blake, playing the expected angle, found himself out of position as the ball trickled between him and the left post. After the goal, Martinez used his jersey to hide the bottom half of his face. McGlynn started for midfielder Alejandro Bedoya, the Union\u2019s captain. Bedoya injured his hip flexor Sept. 17 against Atlanta and missed three of the ensuing five matches, including the final and the Oct. 20 playoff match against FC Cincinnati. \u201cIf you take your captain off any team in this league, you\u2019re going to get significantly weakened,\u201d Curtin said. \u201cTo have the kind of performance we did without Alejandro was pretty big.\u201d Gazdag tied the score in the 59th minute. Wagner began the scoring sequence with a left-wing corner kick that LAFC\u2019s Jesus Murillo headed away. But Philadelphia\u2019s Olivier Mbaizo secured the ball at midfield and passed to Martinez, who found an unmarked Gazdag in the penalty area. Gazdag beat his marker and converted a rising 11-yard shot that settled under the crossbar. LAFC regained a 2-1 lead in the 83rd minute. Vela\u2019s corner kick from the right wing found Murillo, whose glancing header from just outside the right side of the goalkeeper\u2019s crease settled inside the far post. But two minutes later, the visitors again tied the score. Wagner sent his 38-yard free kick from the right wing to Elliott, whose 10-yard header beat Crepeau."

                    "body": "EVERTON STRIKE IT RICH It was a great season for Everton. By spectacularly avoiding relegation, they achieved that rare thing in the Premier League era: a memorable campaign, one for the ages to go alongside the time they avoided relegation in 1998, and the time they avoided relegation in 1994, and the year they finished proudly above Rafael Beneath-Us who then won Big Cup a couple of weeks later. But the best players set their sights even higher than these lofty goals, which explains why Richarlison wants out, up and away. He\u2019s leaving to pursue tangible reward and glory with [Fiver pauses, adjusts pince-nez] yep, it says Spurs, right enough. Whether Tottenham Hotspur is the ideal destination in the Brazilian\u2019s quest for success and silverware is a moot point, given they\u2019ve been waiting even longer than the Ev (and Forest, Derby and Ipswich) for the title. But they are playing in Big Cup next season, have just signed Yves Bissouma, are managed by Antonio Conte, are not managed by Frank Lampard, and haven\u2019t posted losses of \u00a3372m in the last three years. So it\u2019s all relative. An upgrade\u2019s an upgrade\u2019s an upgrade, ain\u2019t that the truth.  Everton are desperate to get the deal done by close of play on Thursday, in the hope of including the \u00a350m fee in this year\u2019s column of their tattered old account book, as they seek to comply with the Premier League\u2019s seemingly arbitrary profit and sustainability rules. Spurs had offered Harry Winks and Steven Bergwijn in part exchange, but Everton wanted the chance to waste the money themselves. And so Richarlison leaves Goodison on good terms, having scored 53 goals in 152 appearances, six of them at crucial points during the recent relegation battle. Not a bad return for the \u00a350m they paid Watford. No silverware, of course, and no profit on the deal, but the way things have been going for Everton lately, this counts as a rare success.

                    "body": "Australia would benefit from a lifting of China\u2019s ban on its coal but any gains would likely be modest as miners have largely redirected supplies elsewhere, analysts said. Shares of ASX-listed coalminers shot up on Wednesday after reports China was considering lifting its restrictions on coal imports from Australia from April. The ban was imposed in mid-2020 amid deteriorating bilateral relations that have since begun to improve.  Investors pared back their expectations of a significant boon for exporters on Thursday. Whitehaven Coal shares ended the day down 1.5%, while New Hope fell 0.7% and Yancoal closed flat. The overall market rose 0.6%. The Albanese government said the resumption of normal trade across the board between Australia and China was \u201cin both countries\u2019 best interests\u201d. \u201cThe Australian coal industry has been successful in finding alternative markets,\u201d a spokesperson for the resource minister, Madeleine King, said.  China-Australia relations have warmed since the change of the federal government in May, with the foreign minister, Penny Wong, last month making the first visit to Beijing by an Australian minister in three years. China has its own motivation to resume coal imports after a severe drought reduced hydropower last year, resulting in a depletion of stockpiles of the fossil fuel. Beijing\u2019s imposition of restrictions on commodity imports from Australia \u2013 such as coal, wine and barley, but not iron ore \u2013 resulted in exporters finding alternative markets.  Sign up for a weekly email featuring our best reads  The chief executive of the Queensland Resources Council, Ian Macfarlane, said the industry would welcome any easing of restrictions and would be keen to tap any revived export opportunities.  \u201c[I]t is worth noting that increased exports to other countries, particularly India and [elsewhere] in Asia, over the last two years have seen long-term relationships built with these countries,\u201d Macfarlane said. \u201cThese alternative markets to China are now seen by Queensland coal exporters as stable, long-term customers for Queensland coal.\u201d The chief economist at Betashares, David Bassanese, said China may be reconsidering its ban on Australian coal because of ongoing uncertainty about global supplies given the war in Ukraine and resulting sanctions on energy exporter Russia. Since banning coal from Australia, China has had to source supplies from more distant sources or increase its reliance of lower-quality coal from Chinese mines. A resumption of coal imports from Australia \u201cshould help our coal export prices to a degree, as the price premium for better quality coal that Australian tends to produce is enhanced\u201d, Bassanese said.  According to the government\u2019s latest quarterly report on resources and energy exports, shipments of metallurgical coal used in steelmaking should rise from 164m tonnes in 2021-22 to 163m tonnes by 2023-24. Soaring prices meant export revenues for the material tripled in 2021-22 to $68b. Thermal coal, burned mostly in power stations, has been more disrupted by the sanctions on Russia, with global supply chains \u201cnow longer and less efficient than they were in 2019\u201d, the report said.  \u201cHigh grade thermal coal (mostly originating from Australia and Russia) has been particularly affected by longer freight distances, and the price premium for high grade coal grew notably larger in 2022,\u201d it said. Thermal coal prices are likely to slide from historic highs of US$360 (A$523) a tonne in 2020 to about US$200/t (A$293) by 2024, the government report said.  The increasing difficult to obtain finance and insurance for coal \u2013 particularly as investors shy away from fossil fuels \u2013 means the sector could be in \u201ca permanent higher price phase\u201d, it said. \u201cThis is expected to reduce its competitiveness relative to other energy sources over the longer term.\u201d Australia exported $13.7bn worth of coal to China in 2019, almost $10bn of which was metallurgical coal. Analysis by data firm EnergyQuest has found Australia\u2019s exports of liquefied natural gas (LNG) were unchanged in 2022. Higher prices meant revenues jumped 86% in the year to about $92.8bn. \u201cThe huge growth in export revenue in 2022 is set to drive strong growth in taxation and royalties paid by Australian LNG projects, as well as helping pay for Australia\u2019s imports,\u201d EnergyQuest\u2019s chief executive, Graeme Bethune, said. The exports placed Australia among the top three LNG exporters, with Qatar and the US. LNG exports from Western Australia and the Northern Territory were up 2.1%, while those from Queensland \u2013 which make up slightly less than a third of the total \u2013 fell 3.3%, EnergyQuest said."

                    "body": "Wales have been warned to expect a fast and furious welcome from England at Twickenham on Saturday in a game the home team are billing as a knockout eliminator. With Manu Tuilagi and Courtney Lawes back, Eddie Jones\u2019s side are determined to up the tempo and improve their chances of claiming this year\u2019s Six Nations title. According to Jones\u2019s assistant Martin Gleeson, the former Great Britain rugby league international who is now England\u2019s attack coach, there is a realisation among the players that, as at a World Cup, they must now win their final three games to hoist the trophy.  \u201cIt\u2019s a massive game for us,\u201d Gleeson said. \u201cIt\u2019s the first time crowds have been back for a Six Nations game for a couple of years and we\u2019re treating it like a quarter-final. If we don\u2019t get the result on Saturday, we\u2019re out.\u201d Gleeson will be urging his side to take the game to Wales from the outset, having rated their training session on Tuesday as the best he has seen since he took the job last August. \u201cWe want to take it to them as quickly and early in the game as possible,\u201d he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to be playing in our shell. We want to play the brand of rugby we want straight from the kick-off. We need to have some line speed in defence and hit hard. When we\u2019ve got the ball there\u2019s a few opportunities we can see. We want to play with intent and go after teams.\u201d This go-faster mission statement would appear perfectly suited to a player like Tuilagi, set to feature for the first time since damaging a hamstring against South Africa in the autumn. The statistician Russ Petty has even dug into the archives and found that England have not lost at Twickenham with Tuilagi in their matchday squad since November 2012. \u201cManu can just take the ball, make metres and get us quick ruck ball by himself. Not everyone can do that,\u201d Gleeson said. \u201cThat\u2019s why Manu is the player he is. He\u2019s a guy who can add another dimension to your attack. You don\u2019t always have to create overlaps or gaps in defences; he can punch holes on his own. His acceleration and the power with that is phenomenal. He\u2019ll be good to have in the mix.\u201d  The winds of change, though, continue to blow, with two experienced Joes \u2013 Marchant and Launchbury \u2013 released from the squad last night. In recent days, too, two members of England\u2019s matchday squad from their 2019 Rugby World Cup semi-final win over New Zealand have signalled their retirements, with George Kruis set to join Mark Wilson in stepping away from the game at the age of 32. Both Kruis and Wilson were popular squad men and highly valuable players, with 68 caps for England between them. The former is quitting to devote more time to his burgeoning business career while injury has finally caught up with the latter but, in their different ways, both underline the fierce dedication and sacrifice required to stay at the top of the professional game. It also shows just how swiftly the picture can change from a team-building perspective. There had been talk of Kruis returning to the Premiership with a view to chasing a place in next year\u2019s World Cup in France. Instead Jones and his assistants will have to hope their forward options remain deep enough for it not to matter unduly if they lose any more big men between now and the autumn of 2023. Equally important, though, is to bed in some lasting combinations in key areas rather than simply adding random individuals to the mix here and there. Ben Youngs is set to become England\u2019s most capped player in history this weekend but will be 34 by the time next year\u2019s World Cup kicks off. England\u2019s other two scrum-halves, Harry Randall and Raffi Quirke, have barely started their Test careers and no team in history has won the Webb Ellis Cup with a relative rookie in the No 9 jersey.  Tuilagi and Henry Slade, however, are already a proven midfield double act and, with Owen Farrell still sidelined by injury, the big centre has been seeking to establish a good understanding with Marcus Smith. The pair roomed together during England\u2019s training camp in Jersey and Tuilagi has been trying to put the squad\u2019s younger players at ease. \u201cYou don\u2019t want them to feel pressure,\u201d the 30-year-old said. \u201cWe were just relaxing with nice tea and a couple of biscuits, nice shortbread. That\u2019s the important thing \u2026 to connect and get to know each other.\u201d"
