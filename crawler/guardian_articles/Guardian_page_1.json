                    "body": "A whistleblower who was jailed in Qatar after raising concerns about the mistreatment of migrant workers at World Cup stadium sites was tortured on the eve of the tournament, his family has claimed.\nThe human rights organisation FairSquare also released a letter from the family of Abdullah Ibhais, a former media manager in Qatar\u2019s Supreme Committee, who accused Fifa of \u201ccallous indifference\u201d for ignoring his case.\nFairSquare is now calling for the United Nations working group on arbitrary detention to intervene in the hope that Ibhais will be released from his three-year jail sentence.\n\nIn the letter Ibhais\u2019s family claims he spent four days \u201cin complete darkness in solitary confinement after being physically assaulted\u201d as punishment for contributing to last month\u2019s ITV documentary Qatar: State of Fear? \u2014 with the air conditioning at full blast and used as a torture device. \u201cHe was in a cell of two by one metres with a hole in the ground as a bathroom and with temperatures near freezing,\u201d the letter adds. \u201c\u2018I was already suffering from several bruises after the prison guards\u2019 assault and I was shivering all the time, as the cold air directed to me never stopped. \u2018I hardly slept during those four days,\u2019 he told us.\u201d\nIbhais says he was jailed after raising concerns that the Supreme Committee planned to deny that World Cup workers were involved in a strike of between 4,000 and 6,000 people in Doha. He says he found 200 workers in Education City Stadium and Al Bayt Stadium that had no drinking water and had not been paid for four months. However, Qatar\u2019s authorities insist that Ibhais, who was removed from his role in 2019, was sentenced on fraud charges relating to a contract to produce social media content for the World Cup. But that is disputed by Fair Square, which says he was coerced into a confession and denied a fair trial.\nNicholas McGeehan of FairSquare said Ibhais had gone to Fifa before his arrest. \u201cHe was messaging directly members of Fifa\u2019s human rights team,\u201d said McGeehan. \u201cAt some point, however, they just disappeared. They essentially ghosted him \u2013 for want of a better word \u2013 and he had no further communication from them after that.\u201d\n\nIbhais\u2019s family also directly criticises Fifa in its letter. \u201cWe the family of Abdullah Ibhais are calling out Fifa and its president Gianni Infantino, who once said \u2018the World Cup is the voice of the marginalised\u2019,\u201d it states. \u201cYour deeds haven\u2019t lived up to your words, Fifa is complicit in Abdullah\u2019s imprisonment and Fifa\u2019s silence is tearing apart our family. We refuse Fifa\u2019s callous indifference, we refuse to back down.\nFifa and the Supreme Committee were approached for comment. Both confirmed they were aware of the letter and its contents."

But Great Britain has no moral or legal high ground here. In its most recent (2021-22) statistics, the \u201cenforcement\u201d agency, the Health and Safety Executive (HSE), recorded 123 worker fatalities alongside 80 work-related fatal injuries to members of the public. It also published an estimate of 13,000 deaths as a result of work-related ill health. Other data \u2013 for example, from the UN or the Hazards Campaign \u2013 estimates total deaths caused by work at between 37,000 and 61,000, each year, every year. Yet these attract virtually no enforcement (let alone media or political) response. While the HSE does not break down enforcement data by fatality distinct from other outcomes of violations of law \u2013 the Health and Safety at Work Act 1974 is a criminal statute \u2013 it does publish the fact that in 2020-21 it secured a grand total of 185 convictions for all offences. Convictions have been in freefall since 2010, when there were 730, even if the latter figure is a pinprick in the context of tens of thousands of deaths. Such data bears witness to an old trade union adage \u2013 if you want to kill someone and get away with it, first set up a company, then employ them. Steve TombsEmeritus professor, Open University \u2022 While much has rightly been made of Qatar\u2019s record on LGBT rights and the exploitation of migrant workers, as well as the corrupt fashion in which the tournament was awarded, there were some good things about holding it there. One of them was the massive attendance of fans from African countries such as Senegal and Morocco, who made the competition the spectacle it was. If the World Cup had been held in the UK or in other European countries, many of those fans would not have been admitted because of exclusionary immigration policies. In future, perhaps the World Cup should only be held in places that are both human rights-compliant and where people from all over the world can freely attend.Christopher BertramProfessor emeritus, University of Bristol \u2022 The second letter above was amended on 20 December 2022. An editing change meant that an earlier version said \u201cthe UK or a European country\u201d, where \u201cthe UK or in other European countries\u201d was meant."

A Russian-born conceptual artist has created a replica of the World Cup trophy that slowly fills with crude oil. It has a symbolic price of $150m \u2013 a figure that matches the amount of money allegedly spent on bribes and kickbacks to Fifa officials, according to US criminal investigators in 2015.  The artwork, Fifa World Cup Filled With Qatari Oil (The Dirtiest Cup), is also a reflection on the deaths of thousands of migrant workers who have reportedly died since Qatar was awarded the tournament in 2010. Andrei Molodkin, who created the work in collaboration with the Spanish football publication Revista Libero, said: \u201cI work with negative forms and fill them with political material to show the reality of the situation. Here you have the Fifa World Cup, glowing gold from the residue of Qatari oil. The corruption at the centre of this game becomes inseparable from the riches of the host nation.\u201d The artwork will be on show at a/political in London on Sunday, the day of the final between Argentina and France. An augmented reality version of the artwork will also be available on Sunday at the Lusail Stadium in Qatar, where the final will be played. Last weekend, a Kenyan security guard fell to his death from the eighth story of the stadium. The tournament\u2019s organisers said the circumstances of his fall would be investigated. Molodkin said there had been a \u201csystematic process of labour rights violations\u201d in Qatar. \u201cThousands of workers have been exploited, some subjected to forced labour. Their passports have been taken away from them, their living conditions are appalling, their salaries are low, and payments are delayed or disappeared. \u201cSince Qatar won the bid for the 2022 World Cup, over 6,500 workers have died,\u201d he said. Although the price tag put on the artwork was symbolic, funds from its sale would be used to support the families of workers who had died, he added. Earlier this year, Molodkin created a portrait of Vladimir Putin, the Russian president, using blood donated by Ukrainian soldiers. The war in Ukraine had brought back the \u201cpsychological trauma\u201d of his military service in the Soviet army. \u201cI know the smell of the gun and the tank,\u201d he said. Fifa World Cup Filled With Qatari Oil (The Dirtiest Cup) will be on display at a/political, the Bacon Factory, 6 Stannary St, Kennington SE11 4AA, 11am-6pm on Sunday"

                    "body": "Qatar\u2019s impending World Cup, which kicks off next Sunday, does not only require the creation of vast sporting infrastructure almost from scratch. It also comes with a striking fetish \u2013 in the case of six of its eight stadia claiming to look like things that they are not: a \u201cdiamond in the desert\u201d; a traditional woven cap; the sails (or possibly the hulls) of a pearl fishing dhow; a nomads\u2019 tent; an ancient ceramic bowl that is also a candlelit lantern; a sand dune that is also a shield. There\u2019s something a bit gift shop, a bit tourist tat, about this shifting of shapes and scales \u2013 an Eiffel Tower cigarette lighter, anyone? A koala made of seashells? But the designers and marketing wizards behind this construction project, variously reported in a range from \u00a35.7bn to \u00a38.7bn, seem to think that metaphorical monikers are somehow essential to their grand project. The stadium designs do at least take to some sort of parodic conclusion the logic of \u201ciconic\u201d architecture over the past quarter-century, which is to get big names to design something striking, marketable and (since the invention of the platform) Instagram-friendly. The \u201cBirds Nest\u201d stadium for the 2008 Beijing Olympics had all the essential ingredients. The naming of London skyscrapers after edibles and domestic objects is another precedent.  Internationally celebrated practices are involved in Qatar \u2013 Zaha Hadid Architects have designed the dhow-like Al Janoub, Foster and Partners the bowl/lantern of Lusail\u2013 alongside some less so. The designs come with swirls and patterns and changing colours and glow-in-the-dark features. They have those metaphors. Of the two that do not, one has the edgy-sounding name of 974 \u2013 like a Shoreditch club, perhaps \u2013 which refers both to the number of shipping containers out of which it is partly made and the international dialling code of Qatar. The other, the Khalifa International stadium, is the transformation of a facility first built in 1976. These buildings have jobs to do, of course, in particular the hosting of World Cup football matches. On this, it\u2019s premature to judge them until they have done so, and \u2013 given that considerable global expertise has now accumulated around such matters as sightlines, acoustics and crowd management \u2013 it can be hoped they may make a reasonable fist of this. On the other hand, it\u2019s hard to imagine that much by way of atmosphere will be conjured from the brand-new constructions, rising from car parks and plazas and (in one case) the edge of a golf course.  They also have to overcome paradoxes inherent in their very existence. The problem of legacy that afflicts Olympiads and other temporary sporting extravaganzas \u2013 what to do with the vast facilities after the crowds leave \u2013 is here more extreme than ever before. The combined 380,000 capacity of the eight stadiums roughly equals the total number of citizens of Qatar and is a large proportion of the country\u2019s total population (including migrants and other expats) of about 3 million.  Clearly, the numbers are not there to sustain a football culture that would fill the stadiums with folk out for their banter and pies every weekend. So the stadiums have mostly been designed to shrink after their brief use. Several will be halved in capacity by having their upper tier removed, with hotels promised for the Al Thumama stadium (the one like a gahfiya cap) and the Al Bayt (the giant tent). Stadium 974 can be wholly dismantled and re-erected, in whole or in parts, elsewhere. All have a capacity of 40,000 for the World Cup, except for the 60,000 Al Bayt and the 80,000-seat Lusail, where the final will be held on 18 December.  The latter could be converted to house (according to the official explanation) \u201caffordable housing units, shops, food outlets, health clinics and even a school\u201d. It would be a remarkable achievement so radically to transform an ex-stadium in this way, but these vague-sounding plans, 10 years after Qatar won the bid, prompt scepticism. There has to be some doubt, too, whether the remaining stadiums would easily be filled, even at reduced sizes. These buildings also have to look as if they are at least trying to be sustainable, because environmental rhetoric is now built into grand international endeavours. The really sustainable thing would have been to hold the World Cup somewhere where countless tonnes of concrete and steel would not have been needed to construct ephemeral stadiums; also where regular 40C temperatures would not have necessitated extensive air conditioning, but the Fifa of Sepp Blatter, when it awarded the competition to Qatar, unaccountably overlooked these considerations. Qatar can, however, boast that water is recycled to irrigate the Lusail stadium\u2019s plants, while the Al Thumama is claimed to have \u201cefficient\u201d air conditioning; 90% of the construction materials of the Ahmad Bin Ali stadium \u2013 the dune one \u2013 are recycled and trees already on the site have been spared the axe.  Most of which sounds like a flimsy response to climate emergency. But then the biggest job these stadiums have to perform is propaganda \u2013 they must present the 2022 World Cup as something other than the triumph of pure wealth that it mostly is, and they must distract from a flurry of allegations on such awkward issues as human rights and the ill-treatment, and deaths, of migrant construction workers. They must conceal both the deep absurdity of the operation and the near-nothingness that lies behind it. This is where the bowls and tents and dunes come in, with their allusions to nature and culture. They come with some virtuoso PR guff \u2013 \u201calive with heritage, an icon for the future\u201d, \u201cwhere desert stories unfold\u201d, \u201ca shimmering jewel of inspiration\u201d. The patterns on the facade of the Ahmad Bin Ali stadium, by British based BDP Pattern, \u201ccharacterise different aspects of the country: the importance of family, the beauty of the desert, the native flora and fauna and local and international trade\u201d. With these words and images they attempt an illusion of localism that is wafer-thin.  Some of the projects display architectural skill. Lusail has grace and the Al Janoub has a certain poised dynamism. If Stadium 974, by the Spanish practice Fenwick Iribarren, successfully demounts as advertised, it could be a useful prototype for the future. But in the end, the farce of Qatar 2022 is summed up by the resemblance of the Al Janoub stadium, widely noticed when the designs were revealed in 2013, to a vulva. The subsequent squaring-off of the opening in its roof has reduced but not removed this likeness. If the organisers of this vainglorious event want to play silly games with images, it\u2019s karma that they got one they didn\u2019t want."

[Homosexuality] is haram. You know what haram means?\u201d\nWhen asked why it was haram, or forbidden, Khalid Salman said: \u201cI am not a strict Muslim but why is it haram? Because it is damage in the mind.\u201d\nSalman was speaking in his capacity as an ambassador for the 2022 World Cup, a role he shares with a number of football legends including Cafu and Xavi Hern\u00e1ndez. Organisers described the role of ambassador as \u201charnessing the power of football to create positive social change in Qatar, across the region and around the globe\u201d.\n\nRasha Younes of the LGBT rights program at Human Rights Watch said: \u201cSalman\u2019s suggestion that same-sex attraction is \u2018damage in the mind\u2019 is harmful and unacceptable. The failure of the Qatari government to counter this false information has a significant impact on the lives of LGBT residents of Qatar, ranging from fuelling discrimination and violence against them to justifying subjecting them to state-sponsored conversion practices.\u201d\nLast month HRW published a report documenting what it claimed was \u201carbitrary\u201d police action against LGBTQ+ residents in Qatar, including six cases of severe and repeated beatings and five cases of sexual harassment in police custody between 2019 and 2022. A Qatari official said HRW\u2019s allegations \u201ccontain information that is categorically and unequivocally false\u201d, without specifying.\nFans hoping to travel to the World Cup have also expressed concerns over safety in the country. Documents seen by the Guardian suggest police will be told not to take action against public displays of affection or those who protest for LGBTQ+ rights.\n\nLast week the president of Fifa, Gianni Infantino, insisted that \u201ceveryone is welcome [at the World Cup] regardless of origin, background, religion, gender, sexual orientation or nationality\u201d, echoing comments made by the organisers in Qatar. The statement came as part of a letter in which he pleaded with football associations and their players to put aside discussion of political and human rights issues surrounding the tournament and \u201clet the football take the stage\u201d.\nFifa, the World Cup organising Supreme Committee and the Qatari government have been approached for comment."

Updated at 4.50pm GMT    4.47pm    86 min: Netherlands substitution: Kenneth Taylor on for Frenkie De Jong. That\u2019s five substitutions for each side and not for the first time in this tournament on ITV co-comms, Ally McCoist bemoans the fact that all these breaks in play and changes in personnel do little or nothing for the good of the game. I could not agree more.      4.45pm    85 min: Qatar double-substitution: Ahmed Alleldin and Musab Al Khader on for Hatem and Mohamed.      4.43pm    84 min: Netherlands double-substituion: Wout Weghorst and Teun Koopmeiners on for Cody Gakpo and Marten De Roon.      4.41pm    82 min: Daley Blind is lucky not to concede a free-kick on the edge of his penalty area for a foul on Hatem.

Hmmmmm \u2026   Updated at 4.37pm GMT    4.34pm    75 min: In the game you probably should be following and the one I wish I was watching, Senegal have retaken the lead against Ecuador. Chelsea defender Kalidou Koulibaly gets his name on the scoresheet.       4.33pm    74 min: Denzel Dumfries has a shot from distance defelcted off Abdelkarim Hassan. Qatar goalkeeper Andries Noppert dives just to make sure the ball doesn\u2019t creep in at the his near post.      4.31pm    73 min: Eslewhere in Group A, Moises Caicedo has equalised for Ecuador against Senegal, a goal which moves Ecuador back into second place behind the Netherlands.   Updated at 4.36pm GMT    4.30pm    69 min: Berghuis and Janssen replaced Davy Klaassen and Memphis Depay, just in case you were wondering.      4.29pm    67 min: Just on for the Netherlands, Steven Berghuis and Vincent Janssen get in behind the Qatar defence and practically walk the ball into the net, with Berghuis stroking home from about one yard out after having the ball sqaured his way by Janssen. Their efforts are in vain as Cody Gakpo handled the ball in the build-up. Referee Bakary Gassama disallows the goal after consulting his pitchside monitor.   Updated at 4.34pm GMT    4.26pm    64 min: Qatari triple-substitution: Ali Assadalla, Karim Boudiaf and Mohammed Muntari on for Al Haydos, Madibo and Hatem.      4.21pm    62 min: Klaassen loses the ball in midfield and Qatar advance down the left flank. The cross comes in but it\u2019s too close to Netherlands goalkeeper Andries Noppart, who grabs it to his chest.   Updated at 4.26pm GMT    4.19pm    60 min: Pedro Correia crosses into a Dutch penalty area that is uncharacteristically well populated by Qataris. Sadly, he overhits his delivery and sends the ball sailing out towards the left flank.      4.16pm    56 min: Abdelkarim Hassan crosses from the byline but once again there is a depressingly conspicuous absence of Qataris in the Dutch penalty area. It\u2019s maddening.      4.14pm    54 min: Afif is played in behind the Dutch defence to the byline. Upon controlling the ball, he takes a look up and realises that none of his teammates are in the box. Instead of crossing just for the sake of it, he plays the ball backwards and another promising Qatari move breaks down.      4.12pm    53 min: Nathan Ake has just been booked for something or other. Apologies, I didn\u2019t see why.      4.11pm    49 min: Davy Klaassen sent in a cross from the left, which Boualem Khoukhi tried to head clear. The Qatar defender succeeded only in flicking the ball to Depay at the far post and his shot from a few yards out was brilliantly blocked by Barsham. With three Qatari defenders around him in the penalty area, De Jong was the quickest \u2013 arguably only \u2013 player to react and had the simplest of tasks in prodding the ball home.      4.08pm   GOAL! Netherlands 2-0 Qatar (De Jong 48)  49 min: Frenkie De Jong scores from close range on the follow-up after Qatar goalkeeper Meshaal Barsham had saved brilliantly from Memphis Depay.

Afif sends the ball into the Dutch penalty area, where Nathan Ake heads it out for a throw-in.      3.51pm   Half-time: Netherlands 1-0 Qatar  Peep! Bakary Gassama signals the end of the first half and the players adjourn to the dressing-rooms. The Netherlands lead courtesy of Cody Gakpo\u2019s third goal in as many group games and currently look set fair to top Group A at stumps.     Updated at 3.52pm GMT    3.49pm    45+2 min: The Dutch are playing the closing moments of this first half at near walking pace. Memphis Depay pulls a volley wide from distance after pouncing on a flick from Klaassen. We get a close up of the Netherlands striker on his first start in this tournament after a spell out with a serious hamstring injury and he looks like e is blowing out of his nether regions.      3.47pm    45+1 min: Akrim Afif is sent haring down the left wing but is unable to keep the ball from deep in play.   Updated at 3.50pm GMT    3.46pm    45 min: We\u2019ll have three minutes of added time.      3.45pm    44 min: The Netherlands continue to dominate and are in almost total control of this game.

He misplaces his pass and a promising attack breaks down.      3.39pm    39 min: Assim Madibo is penalised for a foul on Memphis Depay and gets a ticking-off from referee Bakary Gassama. The free-kick is played wide to Daley Blind and Netherlands continue to press and probe around the edge of the Qatar penalty area.      3.38pm    37 min: Qatar are starting to look a little threatening and have been playing quite good football for the past few minutes. They\u2019re clearly not anywhere near the same level as the Netherlands but at last, over half an hour into the game, they\u2019re finally having a go.      3.36pm    34 min: Abdelkarim Hasan is sent on his way down the left touchline courtesy of a nice flick and sends a cross into the Dutch penalty area. There is not a single Qatari player there to trouble Virgil van Dijk as he tidys up for the Netherlands.

The ball\u2019s played toward the penalty spot, where Abdelkarim Hassan tries to volley it goalwards. Over the bar. The idea was good but the execution wasn\u2019t great.      3.23pm    22 min: Qatar win themselves a corner after their best passage of play thus far. Ahmed beat Dumfries down the left, pulled the ball inside for Al Haydos and his cross was put out for a corner.      3.20pm    20 min: Homam Ahmed blatantly slaps the ball with his hand as it travelled over his head but avoids a yellow card for as deliberate a handball as you will ever see.      3.19pm    19 min: Netherlands corner. The ball\u2019s swung into the Qatar penalty area and Klaassen gets his head to it, but only just it. He\u2019s unable to steer the ball goalwards and it fizzes over the bar.      3.18pm    17 min: Memphis Depay is penalised for backing into Pedro Correia on the edge of the Qatar penalty area as he tried to receive a pass. It\u2019s a harsh decision and he voices his unhappiness with the referee.      3.16pm    16 min: Denzel Dumfries pulls the ball back into the Qatar penalty area from the byline but it\u2019s intercepted by Hasan Al Haydos, who puts it out for a corner.

Updated at 3.18pm GMT    3.13pm    12 min: Daley Blind gets in behind the Qatar defence, played in by Davy Klaassen. He pulls the ball back to Klaasen, whose shot is blocked. The ball breaks back in the direction of Blind, who shoots from a tight angle when perhaps he might have been better served by squaring it for Memphis Depay. Qatar goalkeeper Meshaal Barsham saves.      3.11pm    11 min: Akrim Afif wins a free-kick for his side deep in Qatar territory, going to ground in a thicket of Dutch players despite nobody appearing to touch him. Qatar clear the ball upfield.      3.10pm    9 min: Another clash of heads! This time it\u2019s Daley Blind and Ismail Mohamed, who ships his second blow to the noggin in these early stages. Blindseemed to come out the worst of this particular collison but both man appear fit to continue.      3.08pm    8 min: Now Qatar\u2019s left wing-back Homam Ahmed goes to ground in need of treatment after a clash of heads as he contested a high ball.      3.07pm    7 min: There\u2019s a short break in play as Qatar right wing-back Ismail Mohamed recevies treatment after getting a bang on the head.      3.06pm    4 min: The Netherlands cut through the Qatari defence like a hot knife through butter. Memphis Depay, who shapes to shoot but is crowded off the ball. It breaks in the direction of Davy Klaassen, who stretches but is unable to make contact.   Updated at 3.11pm GMT    3.04pm    2 min: An early chance for Qatar, as they steal the ball in midfield and advance. Abdelaziz Hatem tries his luck from distance and his shot is on target. It doesn\u2019t trouble Andries Noppert in the Dutch goal unduly.  Updated at 3.07pm GMT    3.01pm   Netherlands v Qatar is go ...  1 min: The Netherlands get the ball rolling and almost immediately play it long over the top from deep. It bounces in the penalty area with Memphis Depay in hot pursuit. He stretches every sinew but is unable to hook it goalwards. Goal kick.      2.55pm    Not long now: The teams march out on to the pitch led by captains Virgil van Dijk and Hasan Al Haydos. They line up either side of Gambian referee Bakary Gassama and his team of match officials and it\u2019s time for the national anthems. The players of Qatar wear white shirts, shorts and socks. The Dutch are a vision in orange. Although this is Qatar\u2019s final game in this competition, there seem to be an awful lot of empty seats in the stadium.      2.45pm         2.04pm    Those teams: As is his wont, Louis van Gaal makes fools of those of us who thought he\u2019d start Marten de Roon and Memphis Depay on the bench again. Memphis starts up front alongside Cody Gakpo, with Steven Bergwijn dropping to the bench. De Roon comes into midfield in place of Teun Koopmeiners. Qatar coach Felix Sanchez makes one change, as far as I can see. Karim Boudiaf drops out of midfield and is replaced by Abdelaziz Hatem.       1.46pm   Netherlands v Qatar line-ups  Netherlands: Andries Noppert, Daley Blind, Nathan Ake, Virgil van Dijk (c), Jurrien Timber, Denzel Dumfries, Marten de Roon, Davy Klaassen, Frenkie de Jong, Cody Gakpo, Memphis Depay. Qatar: Meshaal Barsham, Pedro Miguel, Abdelkarim Hassan, Abdelaziz Hatim, Hassan Al-Haydos (c), Akram Afif, Ismail Mohamad, Homam Ahmed, Assim Madibo, Boualem Khoukhi, Almoez Ali.  Updated at 2.04pm GMT    1.45pm    Louis van Gaal: \u201cI think you always have to identify the goal, the purpose for which you are here and then you can work your way toward that purpose,\u201d said the Netherlands manager when asked about his pre-tournament announcement that the Netherlands would win the tournament. \u201cIf you say \u2018Well, the round of 16 is enough, the quarter-finals are enough\u2019, that isn\u2019t the right way to do things. The right way to do things is to think you will become champions. I never said that we\u2019re going to become world champions, but that we can become this.\u201d      1.44pm    Felix Sanchez: \u201cWhen you play against a team such as the Netherlands, you don\u2019t need any motivation,\u201d said Qatar\u2019s manager in his pre-match press conference. \u201cIt\u2019s a challenge for our players to face such a team. This was a very demanding group for us. We\u2019ve competed with our ups and downs. We\u2019d have preferred to be in a better situation. \u201cI think these players have achieved a great deal over the last years. Now we need to be aware that to compete at this level, we are still lagging behind. I think if we work at this on a daily basis, gradually we will be closer to this level. I don\u2019t feel disappointed or embarrassed. The World Cup is the most demanding competition, and only a few can be here. We are still slightly behind. The country will continue working so that the next time Qatar comes to a World Cup, hopefully soon, we\u2019ll be able to compete better than we did this time.\u201d      1.36pm       Updated at 2.14pm GMT    1.34pm    Today\u2019s match officials   Referee: Bakary Gassama  Assistant referees: Elvis Noupue and Mahmoud Abouelregal Fourth official: Ma Ning  Video Assistant Referee: Redouane Jiye       1.34pm    Early team news Dutch players Memphis Depay and Marten De Roon came into the tournament nursing injuries but both featured off the bench in the Netherlands\u2019 draw with Ecuador but may start on the bench again today. A goalscorer in both of his nations in this tournament so far, Cody Gakpo is likely to start again. Having seen the manner in which he and his PSV Eindhoven teammate Xavi Simons tore Arsenal\u2019s defence apart at the Philips Stadion earlier this seaason, I\u2019m hopeful that Van Gaal will give the exciting but as yet uncapped 19-year-old his international debut at some point this afternoon. Qatar manager Felix Sanchez has a fully fit squad of players to choose from and may hand Mohammed Muntari a start ahead of Assin Madibo after the Al Duhail striker came off the bench to score his side\u2019s only goal of the tournament so far against Senegal.      1.30pm   Group A: Netherlands v Qatar  The giant Bedouin tent that is Al Bayt Stadium plays host to one of two Group A games being played simultaneously this afternoon. The Netherlands go into this game knowing that just a draw will guarantee their passage to the knockout rounds, while Qatar are playing for nothing more than pride as they try to avoid the acute ignominy of becoming the first host nation in World Cup history to exit the tournament without securing so much as a single point. In the extremely unlikely event that they beat the Dutch, Louis van Gaal\u2019s side could still advance to the Round of 16 if Ecuador beat Senegal in the group\u2019s other match. Kick-off in Al Khor is at 3pm (GMT) but stay tuned in the meantime for team news and build-up.   "

Stay on the site for Paul MacInnes\u2019s match report, and lots more besides, with two big games coming up. Thanks for reading and interacting. Have a good weekend. Bye.\n\n\n\n 3.17pm  \n\nNetherlands v Ecuador will be under way shortly, with Qatar\u2019s hopes of remaining in the competition dependent on an unlikely Ecuador victory. Barry Glendenning is describing it.\n\n\n\n\n 3.12pm  \n\nNews from elsewhere: the BBC is reporting that Neymar is out of Brazil\u2019s next two matches with ligament damage in his right ankle.\n\n\n\n 3.10pm  \n\nMy kind of email correspondence: \u201cHi Tom, Hope you enjoyed your apple cake, I made an apple tart at halftime. Disappointed for Wales too.\u201d That\u2019s pretty smart work, given all the first-half injury time cutting into baking time. But the cake was lush, thanks\n\nUpdated at 3.12pm GMT\n\n\n 3.04pm  \n\nThat was a pretty serviceable second half. Senegal were clearly superior, and had enough finishing power, and ability off the bench, to see the job through. And Qatar actually raised their game, creating a decent flurry of chances and scoring a well-crafted goal. Afif and Mohamad in particular had good games, while Sabaly, Diedhiou and Diatta were among the Senegal players to impress.\n\n\n\n 3.01pm  \nFull-time: Qatar 1-3 Senegal\n\nSenegal record Africa\u2019s first win at these finals, Qatar are heading out unless Ecuador beat the Netherlands\n\n\n\n 3.01pm  \n\n90+5 mins: Dieng wins Senegal a corner, and Gueye fiddles about by the flag and wins another, but doesn\u2019t have time to take it.

The stadium has rapidly emptied, though Senegal\u2019s fans are still very much havin\u2019 it.\n\n\n\n 2.56pm  \n\n90 mins: Qatar are getting into wide positions and putting decent crosses in now, as another searching one is met by a blocked header. \nWe\u2019ll have six added minutes, which is modest by the standards of this tournament.\n\n\n\n 2.53pm  \n\n87 mins: Pape Ciss receives a yellow card for scything down Mohamad after the Qatar player had snatched a loose ball just inside the Senegal half. And Hassan has a decent go from the free-kick, hammering a fierce left-foot shot just wide of Mendy\u2019s left-hand post. Qatar have started to play when it\u2019s too late.\n\n\n\n 2.50pm  \n\n85 mins: Qatar made two more subs just before the goal \u2013 Waad for Ahmed, Salman for Miguel\n\n\n\n 2.49pm  \n\nThat was simple and well worked \u2013 smart interplay on the right leading to a good low cross from Iliman Ndiaye to Dieng inside the box, who turned and clipped it firmly past Barsham\n\nUpdated at 3.08pm GMT\n\n\n 2.48pm  \nGoal!

Qatar 1-2 Senegal (Muntari 77)\n\nHang on a sec; game on?\n\n\nUpdated at 2.50pm GMT\n\n\n 2.41pm  \n\n76 mins: \u201cShades of Gordon Banks vs Pele in that last Mendy save?\u201d hyperventilates William Hargreaves. Let\u2019s return to this MBM in 52 years and see eh?\n\n\n\n\n 2.39pm  \n\n74 mins: Qatar win another corner after another effective cross, but it\u2019s headed out for a home throw.\nTwo more Senegal subs Bamba Dieng and Sheffield United\u2019s Iliman N\u2019Diaye for Sarr and Diedhiou.

A fine probing cross from the left finds Mohamad six yards out, whose effort is turned behind for a corner. You wait all tournament for a shot on target then two come at once. This is Qatar\u2019s best spell of the tournament\n\u201cFull-throated support for Catarr. Despite coughing up 2 goals Catarrh seem to be quite phlegmatic,\u201d honks Ben Bamford in the \u201cmy wife\u2019s gone to the West Indies\u201d style.\n\n\nUpdated at 2.34pm GMT\n\n\n 2.29pm  \n\n64 mins: Senegal substitution: Ciss for Diatta\n\n\n\n 2.29pm  \n\n64 mins: One corner becomes two, and from the second, Miguel turns deftly just inside the area but then skews his shot horribly high and wide. But it\u2019s a free-kick to Senegal anyway.\n\n\n\n 2.28pm  \n\n63 mins: They have had a shot on target! Afif and Ali combine smartly on the edge of the area, and the latter\u2019s firm low drive is brilliantly turned behind by Mendy\n\n\n\n 2.26pm  \n\n61 mins: Chance for Qatar! Hassan looks up and has a crack from wide on the left, 25 yards out, and it\u2019s two or three inches wide. That shot on target may yet come.\n\n\n\n 2.24pm  \n\n59 mins: A half-chance for Senegal as Koulibaly\u2019s low cross from the right finds Diedhiou who turns and shoots but the effort is blocked.\n\n\n\n 2.22pm  \n\n57 mins: Afif leads another Qatar break and he has Ahmed in a good position to his right but he can\u2019t pick him out. A waste.\n\n\n\n 2.21pm  \n\n54 mins: Afif plays in al-Haydos down the right who draws a foul from Diedhiou (I think). The free-kick causes some bother in a packed area (Senegal had all 11 back) and another half-chance shot from Hassan is blocked.\n\n\nUpdated at 2.26pm GMT\n\n\n 2.18pm  \n\n52 mins: Booking for Senegal\u2019s Jakob for a stray and dangerous elbow out on the left.\n\n\n\n 2.16pm  \n\n51 mins: Qatar nearly have their first effort on target when Hassan meets a raking free-kick from the left with a glancing header but he can\u2019t get enough on it and it drifts wide. And it\u2019s a free-kick against them for a foul anyway.\n\n\n\n 2.14pm  \n\nClassic goal from a corner, that. It\u2019s skimmed in and Diedhiou advances to the near post, escapes his marker and angles a fine header into the opposite top corner. Qatar are heading for the exit.\n\nUpdated at 2.15pm GMT\n\n\n 2.13pm  \nGoal! Qatar 0-2 Senegal (Diedhiou 48)\n\nAnd they score from the corner!\n\n\nUpdated at 2.15pm GMT\n\n\n 2.12pm  \n\n47 mins: There\u2019s very definitely not a full house for this, and it\u2019s Senegal\u2019s fans making more noise at the minute. Senegal win the first corner of the half when Sarr skips clear down the right but Hassan puts in a fine, clean tackle to thwart him\n\n\n\n 2.10pm  \n\nPeep! Senegal restart proceedings \u2026 no changes made by either side.\n\n\n\n 2.09pm  \n\nThe players are back out \u2026\n\n\n\n 2.09pm  \n\nThe Beeb have helpfully reminded us that it\u2019s FA Cup second round weekend, and Kings Lynn v League Two surprise package Stevenage looks a good\u2019un. Anyone going to a domestic game anywhere in the world tomorrow?\n\n\n\n 2.08pm  \n\nHalf-time reading: a nice piece on Australia\u2019s Garang Kuol\n\n\n\n\n 2.07pm  \n\nSome email action. Richard Hirst writes: \u201cAlthough as an England supporter I wouldn\u2019t want it to happen, I think you are wrong about a USA win against England ending Wales\u2019 chances. Arguably the most uncomplicated, albeit unlikely, way for Wales to progress is for the USA to beat England and Iran and Wales to beat England. That way USA finish with seven points, Wales four and England and Iran three. Simples!\u201d\nTrue, but if USA win tonight, England will have to field their strongest side against Wales; if England win, they won\u2019t. Southgate oversaw a dead-rubber flop against Belgium four years ago \u2013 more of the same would suit Wales.\n\u201cThe Non-European teams are doing fine in this World cup,\u201d says Bogdan Katarlic. \u201cthey have a lot of players playing in the European clubs and also it seems to me that their FAs are more serious than they were before. What do you think why they have improved in the last few years?\u201d\nI think the European club game\u2019s a factor, both in terms of it containing, and schooling, more non-European players, but also a slight sense that for European players, club trumps country whereas the international game\u2019s a bigger deal elsewhere. But these are just random pub thoughts really.\n\n\n\n 1.56pm  \nHalf-time: Qatar 0-1 Senegal\n\nSenegal play out the remainder of the half with possession football, and that brings to an end a dominant first half from the African champions. It\u2019s not been a thriller and Qatar are on the verge of the quickest host-exit from a World Cup. But they\u2019re only a goal down and have had the odd flurry.\nRight, I\u2019m off for a bit of apple cake and a sulk about Wales. Ben Fisher has described that more here. back in a bit.\n\n\n\n\n 1.52pm  \n\n45+6 mins: A half-chance as the ball is clipped forward for local hero Ali on the right of the area but Mendy comes out to claim.\n\n\n\n 1.51pm  \n\n45+5 mins: Afif, Qatar\u2019s best player so far, wins a corner on the left but it\u2019s headed clear and Diallo smartly wins Senegal a throw on the left.\n\n\n\n 1.50pm  \n\n45+3 mins: Diallo begins another attack with some elegant dribbling in his own half before it\u2019s worked out to Sarr on the right but his inaccurate cross is claimed by Barsham.\n\n\nUpdated at 2.11pm GMT\n\n\n 1.49pm  \n\n45+2 mins: Another Qatar booking, for Ahmed after a horribly unsubtle late lunge at Koulibaly.\n\n\n\n 1.47pm  \n\n45 mins: We\u2019ll have seven long minutes of stoppage time\n\nUpdated at 1.47pm GMT\n\n\n 1.46pm  \n\n44 mins: Barsham blooters a goalkick out of play on the right, and Mohamed hurts himself in a clash going for it with his teammate Pedro Miguel. Someone needed to shout for that. Qatar\u2019s level has dipped in the last 10 minutes after a better start.\n\n\n\n 1.43pm  \n\nKhouckhi miskicked a clearance inside the area, slipped and Dia pounced in an instant, rifling a low drive under the keeper. Senegal are off the mark.\n\nUpdated at 1.45pm GMT\n\n\n 1.43pm  \nGoal! Qatar 0-1 Senegal (Dia 41)\n\nIt\u2019s been coming. Horrible mistake though\n\n\n\nUpdated at 1.51pm GMT\n\n\n 1.40pm  \n\n38 mins: Ahmed puts al-Haydos through on the left with a lovely sand-wedge of a pass but the captain can\u2019t beat his man. But Barsham then almost plays himself into trouble when he stumbles with ball at feet just outside the area, and Senegal are in the ascendance again. Barsham does look nervy too. Senegal should probably put him under more pressure.\n\n\n\n 1.37pm  \n\n36 mins: Nice interchange from Sarr and Diedhou plays the latter in just inside the area but he hesitates a fraction and Qatar clear. Senegal need to start making this count. Once again, that Man\u00e9-less cutting-edge issue dogs them.\n\nUpdated at 1.38pm GMT\n\n\n 1.36pm  \n\n34 mins: Penalty shout for Qatar! Madibo is neatly played in after a give and go on the left side of the area and Sarr bundles him over. He shuns VAR and Senegal are extremely lucky there, even though a home goal would have been absurdly against the run of play.\n\n\n\n 1.34pm  \n\n32 mins: Ahmed needs lengthy treatment after that foul but he\u2019s OK to continue.\n\u201cSenegal are still probably too good for Qatar,\u201d writes K\u00e1ri Tulinius, \u201cbut it\u2019s remarkable how much more alert and aggressive Qatar is, in comparison to the opening game. If they\u2019d played like this then, it would at least have been a contest. Ecuador may end up gaining the most from a World Cup host buckling under pressure since Germany in 2014.\u201d What are people\u2019s favourite host-chokes? Italy v Argentina 90 was a memorable one. Spain v N Ireland 82? though they still got through.\n\n\n\n 1.32pm  \n\n30 mins: Barsham has a wobblier moment as he races rashly out to a long ball for Sarr but the forward can\u2019t make it count and Qatar clear. Then Dia is booked foro bringing down Ahmed on halfway\n\n\n\n 1.30pm  \n\n28 mins \u2026 which comes to nothing. Senegal come again and Barsham comes out for a confidence-boosting punch clear, but Sabaly picks up and sends a fierce volley wide. \n\n\n\n 1.29pm  \n\n27 mins: A neat run down the right from Mohamed but his low ball in is smartly intercepted by Koulibaly. Senegal go straight up the other end and win a corner \u2026\n\n\n\n 1.27pm  \n\n26 mins: Another Qatar shot! Hasan belts one from just left of the area, and again a clear deflection is missed by the officials. Goalkick\n\n\n\n 1.26pm  \n\n24 mins: Ahmed brings down Sabaly, again done for pace, and Qatar need to be careful with that. After which Gueye skims a low shot just past the post. Best chance so far.\n\n\n\n 1.22pm  \n\n20 mins: Afif looks sprightly down the right and marauds down that flank again winning an attacking throw near the corner flag but Senegal are quick to break and Ismail Mohamad receives the first booking of the game for illegally halting said break.\n\n\nUpdated at 1.31pm GMT\n\n\n 1.20pm  \n\n18 mins: Senegal go straight up the other end and Diatta wins a corner on the left. It\u2019s a menacing one and Barsham, the keeper, is outjumped but it\u2019s headed wide by Diedhou. And Barsham took a blow, and needs treatment. But he\u2019s on his feet within a couple of minutes and can continue.\n\nUpdated at 1.23pm GMT\n\n\n 1.17pm  \n\n15 mins: Qatar win a free-kick in a decent position, Afif lobs it in, it\u2019s cleared but it eventually comes back to him just outside the area but he can\u2019t get on top of the bounce and blasts over and Qatar still seek their first shot on target of the tournament. Better from the hosts though.\n\nUpdated at 1.19pm GMT\n\n\n 1.15pm  \n\n13 mins: The final ball is not quite coming off for Senegal yet with Sabaly overhitting a pass down the right for Gueye.\nMeanwhile, Cold War Steve has done a thing for us:\n\n\n\n\n 1.14pm  \n\n12 mins: Mendy wins the ball in midfield and drives forward to lob a pass in the direction of Diatta but he can\u2019t get a decent ball in and Qatar clear. Senegal well on top already here.\n\n\nUpdated at 1.20pm GMT\n\n\n 1.12pm  \n\n10 mins: A half-opening for Qatar as Hamam probes on the inside left, but it gets away from him and runs out for a goalkick. Senegal\u2019s outnumbered fans are making a decent old racket, band in good nick.\n\nUpdated at 1.13pm GMT\n\n\n 1.11pm  \n\n9 mins: Diatta, who\u2019s switched from right to left for this game, gets free down the left and wins a throw. It\u2019s worked out right and the cross finds Diedhou in space but he\u2019s a bit slovenly and his shot is blocked and comes out to Dia (I think) who fires wide.\n\nUpdated at 1.11pm GMT\n\n\n 1.09pm  \n\n7 mins: Qatar are keeping their shape better than they did in Sunday\u2019s first half from hell and eventually attack through Afif who excites the crowd with a run down the left but he lacks support and Senegal clear.\n\n\n\n 1.06pm  \n\n4 mins: Sabaly initiates another attack with some adept juggling on the inside right and it\u2019s eventually worked out to Sarr who wriggles inside the right of area and his shot is deflected into the side netting. But he doesn\u2019t get the corner he should have.\n\nUpdated at 1.07pm GMT\n\n\n 1.04pm  \n\n3 mins: Qatar look to be playing 3-5-2, boldly, but Senegal have the first sustained spell of possession but waste it when Sabaly nods tamely out of play down their right\n\n\n\n 1.01pm  \n\nPeep! And Qatar get us under way.\n\n\n\n 12.55pm  \n\nThe teams are out. The stadium isn\u2019t completely full but it\u2019s still filling up, Qatar\u2019s fans waving their uniform flags\n\n\nUpdated at 1.01pm GMT\n\n\n 12.52pm  \n\nThings you may not know: Qatar\u2019s keeper, Meshaal Barsham is the brother of the high jump Olympic champion Mutaz Essa Barshim, Gary Lineker on the Beeb informs us.\n\nUpdated at 12.53pm GMT\n\n\n 12.49pm  \n\nBefore we start \u2026\n\n\n\n\n 12.45pm  \n\n\u201cNow that Wales has lost to Iran can the USMNT defeat England today?\u201d asks Kurt Perleberg. They could yes, if they build on their impressive first half against Wales and England lapse into the form they were in before Monday. I fancy the USA to score at least, and though England should win a draw isn\u2019t a bad shout. A USA win would properly jigger Wales\u2019s chances though.\nBack to the game in front of us, Qatar might take heart from Iran\u2019s display: if Carlos Queiroz\u2019s side can recover from a catastrophic and politically-charged opener, so might they.\n\n\n\n 12.31pm  \n\nOff the field, crusader costumes are the latest items to be reportedly banned, though frankly I\u2019m playing the smallest violin in the world for anyone in that crass and insensitive get-up. Here\u2019s a guide to what\u2019s not allowed.\n\n\n\n\n 12.27pm  \n\nFancy a bit of Senegal nostalgia? How\u2019s about one of the best games of Japan/South Korea 2002?\n\n\n\n\n 12.14pm  \n\nYour lunchtime reading:\n\n\n\n\n 12.04pm  \n\nGoal! Wales 0-2 Iran. It gets worse for Robert Page\u2019s side but Iran have deserved this \u2013 they\u2019ve been excellent. And there\u2019s full-time.\n\nUpdated at 12.04pm GMT\n\n\n 12.03pm  \n\nBack to this one, and those lineups: the Qatar goalkeeper Saad Al-Sheeb makes way for Meshaal Barsham, unsurprisingly after his jittery display against Ecuador. For Senegal Ismail Jakobs comes into the defence for the injured Cheikhou Kouyat\u00e9 and Pape Abou Cisse is replaced by Famara Diedhiou.\n\n\n\n\n 12.01pm  \n\n Goal! Wales 0-1 Iran \u2013 Iran have won it at the last.\n\n\n\n\n 11.56am  \nThe teams are in\n\nQatar: Barsham, Pedro Miguel, Mohammad, Khoukhi, Abdelkarim Hassan, Ahmed, Al-Haydos, Boudiaf, Madibo, Ali, Afif\nSenegal: Edouard Mendy, Sabaly, Koulibaly, Jakobs, Diallo, Idrissa Gueye, Nampalys Mendy, Diatta, Diedhiou, Ismaila Sarr, Dia.\n\nUpdated at 12.24pm GMT\n\n\n 11.48am  \n\nOr has he? A VAR check does for him and he has to go for clattering Taremi when the forward was clean through. Wales are down to 10 men.\n\n\n\n 11.47am  \n\nAnd in Group B, a tense old encounter is entering its closing stages. With Wayne Hennessey somehow escaping with only a yellow card just now \u2026\n\n\n\n\n 11.38am  \n\nSome essential pre-match reading:\n\n\n\n\n 11.30am  \nPreamble\n\nHello everyone, and welcome to our second World Cup game of the day. It pits the respective Asian and African champions against each other, each of whom lost their opening matches 0-2. At which point, you might argue, the similarities end. While Senegal looked sprightly and competitive against the Netherlands, particularly early on, and were undone mainly by a lack of cutting edge up front, Qatar turned in a rabbits-trapped-in-headlights non-performance against Ecuador, and were lucky their opponents declared at half-time. All that Aspire academy cash, all those gifted places in other tournaments, including this one as hosts, all that unsavoury geopolitical positioning \u2013 and for that?\n\u201cEmotionally, things were very difficult, and dealing with the World Cup is completely different. I hope that the performance will be as competitive against Senegal,\u201d admitted their manager, Felix S\u00e1nchez, yesterday, adding: \u201cWe prepared ourselves for the possibility of an early exit, but this does not mean the end of the project. I am confident that Qatar will continue their project to maintain a strong team, compete and qualify for the upcoming tournaments.\u201d Ah yes, Projects. Always with the Projects.\nAnyway, Qatar almost certainly won\u2019t play as poorly again, and they have shown some pedigree in recent times. Senegal, you fancy, have more though but they sorely missed Sadio Man\u00e9 against the Dutch. They will also be sweating on the full match-fitness of Cheikhou Kouyat\u00e9 and Abdou Diallo, important cogs in the team who were forced off in Monday\u2019s match with niggles. In as much as we can generalise, there does seem to be an early pattern of African teams struggling to score despite plenty of quality and attacking intent. Will that pattern shift here?\nKick off 1pm GMT.\n\n"

                    "body": "David Beckham has made his first public statement on his controversial involvement with the World Cup host nation Qatar, telling a TV show through a spokesperson that he \u201chas always believed that sport has the power to be a force for good in the world\u201d.\n\u201cWe understand that there are different and strongly held views about engagement in the Middle East but see it as positive that debate about the key issues has been stimulated directly by the first World Cup being held in the region,\u201d the statement continued.\nIt added: \u201cWe hope that these conversations will lead to greater understanding and empathy toward all people and that progress will be achieved.\u201d\n\nThe statement \u2013 given to the comedian Joe Lycett and read out on a special edition of his show, Joe Lycett\u2019s Got Your Back \u2013 came in response to intense criticism that Beckham, 47, had accepted millions of pounds from Qatar to serve as an ambassador for the games in spite of the country\u2019s repressive stance on LGBTQ+ rights, its human rights record and allegations of mistreatment of migrant workers.\nThe former England captain\u2019s endorsements for the host nation have included a promotional film for Visit Qatar. \u201cThe modern and traditional fuse to create something really special,\u201d he said. In a subsequent video message, he said that the World Cup would be a platform for progress, inclusivity and tolerance.\nThe endorsements have received stinging criticism, particularly from members of the LGBTQ+ community, who claim that Beckham\u2019s support of Qatar runs counter to his image as a supporter of gay rights.\n\u201cSome of the things that people like David Beckham are learning is that human rights are universal and non-negotiable,\u201d Piara Powar, the director of Fare, an anti-discrimination group, told the Observer last month. \u201cI have no doubt that the LGBTQ+ community in western Europe will see him as somehow a traitor or someone who used to be an ally but no longer is.\u201d\nBeckham\u2019s statement came in the context of a Times article that sought to unpick the football player\u2019s relative absence from the games, despite his image being plastered all over Doha.\nThe paper claimed the celebrity player had placed conditions on his public appearances in Qatar, including that his presence would not be announced ahead of time, alerts would not be sent to reporters and that Beckham had appeared to be shielded from questions.\n\nBut a publicist for the player denied that he had been unavailable. \u201cDavid has been involved in a number of World Cups and other major international tournaments as a player and an ambassador and he has always believed that sport has the power to be a force for good in the world,\u201d the statement said.\nThe statement is notable for its omission: nowhere is Qatar mentioned. That may further anger Qatari officials, who are reported to be frustrated that Beckham has avoided questions and not spoken up for the country he is contracted to promote \u2013 a situation that had become \u201ccounterproductive\u201d for Qatar.\n\u201cFor all the millions of dollars he was earning, the Qatari organisers felt, the scrutiny of their country was just becoming worse,\u201d the paper wrote.\n\u2022 This article was amended on 18 December 2022. Beckham provided his statement to comedian Joe Lycett, not to the New York Times as an earlier version said."

                    "body": "World Cup opening ceremonies don\u2019t carry quite the cultural heft of Olympic opening ceremonies. To make a truly memorable one you need to get Diana Ross to hopelessly miss a penalty or Robbie Williams to give the TV audience his middle finger. Many have interpreted Qatar hosting this World Cup as being about sportswashing their international image and no expense was spared on the 30-minute show that preceded the opening fixture between Qatar and Ecuador. Here is what we learned\u2026\n1) Qatar still trying to sell itself as inclusive\nAn opening video sequence saw a dream to kick progress from an infant in the womb to become a procession through the desert leading to the tent-shaped Al Bayt Stadium, via some space whales.\nThe organisers and Fifa have talked a lot about inclusivity \u2013 of the right kind of course \u2013 which was embodied in a sequence where Morgan Freeman and Ghanim al-Muftah spoke about overcoming differences. Al-Muftah is a Qatari who was born with Caudal Regression Syndrome which prevents the development of the lower spine, and he is a local social media personality.\n\n2) Everybody got their own song\nIn a sequence where dancers seemed to be dressed as Imperial troops from Star Wars holding light sabres, drummers and singers ran through a greatest hits of football chants, and then every now and then the camera would switch to the crowd where, handily, it turned out that groups of fans from competing nations beyond Qatar and Ecuador were all seated together wearing their replica shirts to cheer along.\n\nThere were also giant walking replica shirts that looked like they had escaped from a vintage edition of Jeux sans fronti\u00e8res.\n\n3) Russia still made a mark, despite their ban\nThe Qatari organisers rolled back the years with the mascots of World Cups gone by, marking a welcome reappearance of the likes of Naranjito from Spain 1982 and Footix from France 1998. Perhaps less welcome was the appearance of Zabivaka, Russia\u2019s mascot from the last tournament. Russia were expelled from World Cup qualifying following their invasion of Ukraine in February of this year.\n\nThe parade of old mascots marked the entrance of the 2022 World Cup mascot. La\u2019eeb is meant to be based on a ghutra headdress, but more than one observer has noted that it looks like the risen spirit of the migrant workers who have died in the course of putting this tournament on.\n\n4) Jungkook of BTS has not started his military service yet\nA surefire way to get an army of social media support for your opening ceremony is to include a K-Pop star, and Jungkook from BTS was on hand to sign his song Dreamers from the FIFA World Cup official soundtrack, a concept which would surely baffle Jules Rimet, founder of the whole World Cup caboodle back in the 1920s. After a long national debate, the seven members of BTS, one of the best-selling bands in the world, will shortly be putting their pop careers on pause to do military service in South Korea.\n\n5) Emir claimed World Cup would celebrate diversity\nQatari Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani was a popular figure with the crowd when he appeared, and he smiled broadly after there was a video montage sequence which showed him playing football as a young boy in the 1970s or 1980s.\nSame-sex relationships are illegal in Qatar. Earlier this month, former Qatar international footballer and World Cup ambassador Khalid Salman said that homosexuality was \u201cdamage in the mind\u201d.\nNevertheless al-Thani said the event gathered people of all nationalities and beliefs. \u201cFrom Qatar, from the Arab world, I welcome everyone to the World Cup 2022. How lovely it is that people can put aside what divides them to celebrate their diversity and what brings them together all at once.\u201d\n\n6) Fifa president Gianni Infantino kept quiet \u2013 until the last moment\nAfter Saturday\u2019s bizarre nearly hour-long press conference where Infantino declared he felt gay, disabled and like a migrant worker, he had a much simpler message to deliver during the ceremony itself. Silence. He sat next to the Emir, but said nothing.\nHowever, in an unusual move, long after the ceremony itself had finished, as Qatar and Ecuador assembled on the pitch, Fifa\u2019s president \u2013 unscheduled - took the microphone to say: \u201cfootball unites the world. And now let\u2019s welcome the teams and let the show begin. All the best to everyone.\u201d"

His basic point: media should stop the \u201cprofoundly unjust\u201d scrutiny of the hosts. \u201cIt\u2019ll be the best World Cup ever.\u201d Best game: Argentina 2-2 Netherlands (4-3 pens) It started unremarkably but ended in chaotic, bad-tempered and memorable style. Wout Weghorst\u2019s two late goals \u2013 the second from a clever free-kick routine \u2013 forced Argentina to extra time and penalties after Lionel Messi and co had appeared to be cruising into the quarter-finals. They got there eventually. A mention too for the frantic conclusion to Group E (Costa Rica 2-4 Germany, Japan 2-1 Spain), when Spain faced elimination for three mad minutes, despite having won their opener 7-0.  Most unlikely Twitter exchange In response to this from Andrew Neil (@afneil) \u2013 \u201cI don\u2019t watch many football games. I watched England v USA. It confirmed why I don\u2019t watch many football games\u201d \u2013 came this from Jamie Carragher (@Carra23): \u201cI don\u2019t watch many news shows. I watched GB news. It confirmed why I don\u2019t watch many news shows.\u201d Best Fifa moment Among the governing body\u2019s other standout moments was threatening to impose sanctions on players wearing the rainbow OneLove armband, while taking disciplinary action against Mexico and Ecuador for alleged homophobic chanting by fans. Football remains in the safest of hands.  Most inevitable rethink After a few early 0-0s, the 32-team format proved itself again \u2013 a treat of group-stage drama, elite football at its most pure and engaging. So Fifa is dropping it: 2026 will bloat to 48 teams \u2013 meaning less jeopardy, reduced quality, but, on balance, a lot more money. Noblest tradition An internal squad bust-up. This year it was observed by Belgium, after Kevin De Bruyne and Jan Vertonghen reportedly clashed in the dressing room over De Bruyne telling the Guardian how Belgium are too old to win the World Cup. Coach Roberto Mart\u00ednez called the bust-up \u201cfake news\u201d; De Bruyne turned out to be right. Best dancing Morocco\u2019s Sofiane Boufal danced with his mum (\u201cshe was crying, the emotions make you crazy\u201d); Brazilian players danced to annoy Roy Keane; and Jack Grealish fulfilled a promise to 11-year-old fan Finlay by celebrating his goal against Iran with Finlay\u2019s wavy arm dance, known as \u201cthe Finlay\u201d. Finlay has cerebral palsy like Grealish\u2019s sister Hollie; footage of the pair chatting about it raised spirits. Surprise package: Morocco Who else? No one predicted the Atlas Lions\u2019 progress to become the first African nation to make the last four. Walid Regragui had precious little time to prepare after Vahid Halilhod\u017ei\u0107\u2019s sacking in August. Achraf Hakimi was already an established star but he, and the entire team, far exceeded expectations. Most unlikely cameo Chesney Hawkes performed his 1991 hit The One and Only during England v Wales, then headed home to play Butlin\u2019s in Skegness: \u201cI can\u2019t forget my fans at Butlin\u2019s.\u201d He said the \u201cQatar gig\u201d was \u201camazing \u2026 I spent five weeks at number one and topped the charts on both sides of the Atlantic \u2013 but this was undoubtedly my career highlight.\u201d  Worst live vox pops A viral 13 seconds of live interviewing from Sky News outside the Ahmad bin Ali stadium as Wales fans left after defeat to Iran. Reporter: \u201cGuys, you\u2019re live on Sky Sports. Your reaction to the win?\u201d Fan: \u201cWe lost.\u201d Reporter: \u201cSorry, reaction to the loss?\u201d Second fan: \u201cShit.\u201d Best player name Keeping newspaper subeditors entertained was Morocco keeper Yassine \u201cBono\u201d Bounou, and his penalty-saving display against Spain.

However, S\u00e1nchez, a former Barcelona youth coach who joined the Aspire Academy in Qatar 16 years ago, claimed it is a concerted effort to unsettle the host nation and will not succeed.\n\u201cThere is a lot of misinformation,\u201d said S\u00e1nchez in response to the bribery rumours. \u201cThe internet is a great tool but it is also very dangerous. No one will be able to destabilise us with these statements. We are not affected at all. We are very happy to be playing in a World Cup tomorrow. We are focused on bringing our A-game and will not take anything else into account.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cThe best thing you can do as a team or as a footballer is keep calm and avoid any rumours or noise around you. Obviously we don\u2019t like people criticising our country but in terms of football we have had great preparation.\u201d\nThe Catalan coach was less dismissive of the treatment of migrant workers in Qatar, where thousands have died since Qatar was awarded the World Cup in 2010. He said: \u201cThe loss of human life in working hours is a great tragedy whether it\u2019s here in Qatar or anywhere else in the world. I just hope this World Cup means that we can all work together to benefit the conditions for these groups, not just in Qatar but everywhere else in the world.\u201d\nQatar are 50th in the men\u2019s world rankings and have never qualified for a World Cup, although they are reigning Asian Cup champions \u2013 beating Japan 3-1 in the 2019 final \u2013 and reached the semi-finals of the 2021 Concacaf Gold Cup when invited. \u201cIf we\u2019d have participated in the qualifiers this time we would have qualified,\u201d claimed captain Hassan al-Haydos, Qatar\u2019s most-capped player with 169 appearances. \u201cThis edition of the World Cup is for all Arabs and we bear responsibility for all Arabs. There are four Arab squads taking part and I wish all of them the best of luck.\u201d\n\nS\u00e1nchez\u2019s squad prepared for a group that also contains Senegal and the Netherlands with a four-month training camp earlier this year followed by a month-long camp in Spain last month.\n\u201cAll of our players play in our local league so we decided that one way of strengthening the national team was to take them out of their clubs so they are ready for the national team,\u201d he explained. \u201cIt has been a massive sacrifice. We spent a long period of time abroad and away from our families. That shows our commitment.\n\u201cTomorrow is a very important day for us, a historic moment. It will be an extraordinary day like no other. We have made such a huge effort in this country. We are all devoted to this World Cup. I just hope it\u2019s a great party where we can enjoy the football on the pitch and, off it, the whole world can enjoy this experience.\u201d"

                    "body": "The Welsh first minister has defended his decision to travel to Qatar for the World Cup, saying he feels that the citizens of Wales want their country\u2019s leader there despite concerns about human rights and working conditions. Speaking in Doha on Sunday, Mark Drakeford admitted that the decision to attend was finely balanced but he said he believed it would have been wrong to leave seats allocated to the Welsh government at the opening ceremony and matches unoccupied. \u201cIt\u2019s a closely run thing,\u201d he said. \u201cThe arguments that are made by people who have chosen not to come are absolutely real and to be respected. In the end our conclusion was that people in Wales would not have wanted to see a seat for Wales left empty. It really is a very special opportunity to promote Wales on the world stage.\u201d The UK Labour party leader, Keir Starmer, is boycotting the tournament, but his Labour colleague Drakeford said: \u201cThere is a difference in the responsibility of someone who is the first minster of a nation who has made it to the World Cup final. That is a different set of responsibilities to those exercised by the leader of the opposition.\u201d Asked about the British foreign secretary James Cleverly\u2019s comments that LGBTQ+ football fans in Qatar should \u201crespect the law\u201d of the host country, Drakeford said: \u201cPeople should make the decision they themselves are most comfortable with. For many people, that is a decision not to come at all. Where people do choose to come, they will have thought about that carefully. Once people are here, the focus on the football itself \u2013 you feel that in the air.\u201d Drakeford said he had spoken to the International Trade Union Confederation about workers\u2019 rights before he travelled. \u201cThey are very clear they feel significant change has been secured as the result of their work and the attention of the world on Qatar. The point they made to me was that if we are not willing to offer some recognition of when progress does happen, however we might wish that progress to go faster, further progress are eroded rather than enhanced.\u201d The Welsh first minister was one of the first world leaders to comment on the Fifa president Gianni Infantino\u2019s claim that critics of Qatar\u2019s human rights record were guilty of staggering hypocrisy and racism. Drakeford said: \u201cI think there is a serious point about being prepared to review our own history \u2026 to take a moment to reflect on our own histories, it\u2019s not a moment wasted.\u201d But he added: \u201cThe second thought I had was to remind me of Healey\u2019s first law of holes. Some people will remember Denis Healey, the great Labour politician. And his first law of holes was when you\u2019re in one, stop digging.\u201d The Welsh national team have qualified for their first World Cup finals since 1958. Drakeford, who posed for pictures in front of a giant bucket hat in Welsh colours, said: \u201cIt is genuinely striking to see the Welsh flag flying in so many locations. Small nations I think do bring something very special to the World Cup. Countries who appear less frequently, I think, bring extra spice, extra life.\u201d Asked whether Wales could do well in the competition, he said: \u201cDare to dream. The great thing about sport is that on any one day any team can beat any other. If it\u2019s your day and the luck runs with you, any side can beat any other. We want Wales do well this week and go deeper into the tournament. The team, I am sure, is daring to dream.\u201d"

                    "body": "US soccer journalist Grant Wahl has died after suffering an apparent heart attack at Lusail Stadium, where he was covering the World Cup quarter-final between Argentina and the Netherlands on Friday night. Wahl, who was a correspondent for CBS Sports and wrote a popular Substack column, was 49 years old. \u201cThe entire US Soccer family is heartbroken to learn that we have lost Grant Wahl,\u201d the US Soccer Federation said in a statement. \u201cHere in the United States, Grant\u2019s passion for soccer and commitment to elevating its profile across our sporting landscape played a major role in helping to drive interest in and respect for our beautiful game. As important, Grant\u2019s belief in the power of the game to advance human rights was, and will remain, an inspiration to all.\u201d Wahl was seated in the press box in the upper-most tier of the stadium when he collapsed in extra time, prompting the journalists around him to remove chairs and call for medical assistance.  A team of medics arrived and began administering CPR for the next 20 minutes. After the match concluded, Wahl was taken away from the scene. Wahl\u2019s wife, Dr Celine Gounder, an infectious disease epidemiologist who served on Joe Biden\u2019s coronavirus taskforce confirmed her husband\u2019s death in a statement on Twitter. \u201cI am so thankful for the support of my husband @GrantWahl\u2019s soccer family &amp; of so many friends who\u2019ve reached out tonight. I\u2019m in complete shock,\u201d she wrote. US state department spokesperson Ned Price said in a tweet that the United States is \u201cengaged with senior Qatari officials to see to it that his family\u2019s wishes are fulfilled as expeditiously as possible\u201d.  Wahl made headlines earlier in the tournament when he was detained by security staff at Qatar\u2019s Ahmad bin Ali Stadium for wearing a rainbow shirt to the United States\u2019 World Cup opener against Wales. He said he wore the shirt as a show of solidarity with the LGBTQ+ community. Homosexuality is illegal in Qatar. Wahl wrote on Monday that he had visited a medical clinic in Qatar after feeling unwell. \u201cMy body finally broke down on me. Three weeks of little sleep, high stress and lots of work can do that to you,\u201d Wahl wrote. \u201cWhat had been a cold over the last 10 days turned into something more severe on the night of the USA-Netherlands game, and I could feel my upper chest take on a new level of pressure and discomfort. I didn\u2019t have Covid (I test regularly here), but I went into the medical clinic at the main media center today, and they said I probably have bronchitis. They gave me a course of antibiotics and some heavy-duty cough syrup, and I\u2019m already feeling a bit better just a few hours later. But still: No bueno.\u201d Wahl was perhaps the best known soccer journalist in the United States. He covered his first World Cup in 1994 and joined Sports Illustrated in 1996. He stayed at the magazine for more than two decades, charting the rise of soccer in the US and wrote a well received book on David Beckham\u2019s arrival in MLS. He also wrote the magazine\u2019s first cover story on LeBron James, while the basketball player was a rising star in high school. Qatar was Wahl\u2019s eighth World Cup.  \u201cWe were proud to call him a colleague and friend for two decades \u2013 no writer in the history of SI has been more passionate about the sport he loved and the stories he wanted to tell,\u201d Sports Illustrated said in a statement on Friday night. \u201cOur hearts go out to Celine and his family, as well as everyone who loved his work. He will always be part of the SI family.\u201d Other writers and journalists paid tribute to Wahl as news of his death emerged. \u201cGrant Wahl was my friend, one of the nicest, most truly decent people I have ever had the opportunity to work with. I am flattened,\u201d tweeted Will Leitch, the founding editor of Deadspin.  Brendan Hunt, the writer and co-star of Ted Lasso, also paid tribute to Wahl on Twitter. \u201cSitting here floored by the horrible news that Grant Wahl died today in Qatar,\u201d wrote Hunt. \u201cI have read his work for literally decades; just two months ago I had the pleasure of meeting him, and he was an absolute mensch. This is a tragic and devastating loss.\u201d Wahl was well known as a champion of women\u2019s soccer. Former USWNT star Carli Lloyd described his death as \u201ctruly heartbreaking\u201d on Twitter. She added: \u201cCompletely shocked. My heart goes out to his wife, family, friends and the soccer community.\u201d"

                    "body": "Dua Lipa has denied reports she will perform at the World Cup opening ceremony in Qatar. The chart-topping 27-year-old singer, born in London to parents from Kosovo, said she would only play in the country if it improves its record on human rights. Controversy has surrounded the upcoming football tournament with Qatar\u2019s treatment of migrant workers and criminalisation of same-sex relationships under the spotlight. The treatment of the LGBTQ+ community in Qatar has been a cause for concern for supporters hoping to travel to the country to see their side in action.  After reports linking her to the event, Lipa shared a statement on Instagram, writing: \u201cThere is currently a lot of speculation that I will be performing at the opening ceremony of the world cup in Qatar. I will not be performing and nor have I ever been involved in any negotiation to perform. \u201cI will be cheering England on from afar and I look forward to visiting Qatar when it has fulfilled all the human rights pledges it made when it won the right to host the World Cup.\u201d  BTS star Jung Kook is the only official act confirmed for the opening ceremony, which will be held at Al Bayt stadium on 20 November. US rapper Diplo, DJ Calvin Harris and Jamaican singer Sean Paul will also be performing at the Fifa Fan festival, which will run over the 29 days of the tournament. Lipa is not the first musician to make a point of avoiding playing concerts in Qatar. On Sunday, Sir Rod Stewart revealed he turned down more than US$1m to play in the country last year. He told the UK\u2019s Sunday Times newspaper: \u201cI turned it down. It\u2019s not right to go. And the Iranians should be out too for supplying arms [to Russia].\u201d Also on Sunday, comedian Joe Lycett told David Beckham he would shred \u00a310,000 if the sportsman didn\u2019t pull out of his Qatar World Cup deal. The footballer is reportedly being paid \u00a310m to be an ambassador for the event, and has been heavily criticised for accepting the money, given that he has previously been viewed as an ally to the LGBTQ+ community.

                    "body": "\nMain event\nAnd then there were eight. After four dozen group matches and eight eliminators, Qatar 2022 now has its full complement of quarter-finalists. On Sunday week, the captain of one of the Netherlands, Argentina, France, England, Croatia, Brazil, Morocco or Portugal will triumphantly hoist what is arguably the most iconic trophy in world sport skywards through a deluge of ticker-tape to jubilant roars from his ecstatic teammates, fans and fellow countrymen.\nHaving long spoken of his desire to win trophies, an ambition that has thus far gone unrealised at Tottenham Hotspur, the honour could fall to Harry Kane, but for now England\u2019s captain is unlikely be looking any further than Saturday\u2019s appointment with France, who are second favourites behind Brazil and could become only the third nation in tournament history to retain the title.\nBut being favourites means little. On racecourses across the UK, perceived bankers get turned over with monotonous regularity. While the odds-makers called the last 16 largely correctly, a series of matches that suggested several upsets might be on the cards delivered only one.\n\nAfter a group stage that produced a few seismic shocks and had big name sides such as Germany, Belgium \u2013 and to a lesser extent Denmark and Uruguay \u2013 crash out, most teams who were expected to advance to the quarter-finals from the first knockout round duly obliged, with Spain the notable exception. Australia, Poland, Switzerland, South Korea, the USA and Senegal can all claim to have left Qatar with their heads held high \u2013 Switzerland less so after their thrashing \u2013 but there has always been a certain inevitability about the cream of the last 16 crop rising to the top.\nIn the five World Cup staged previously in this millennium, only South Korea \u2013 co-hosts in 2002 \u2013 have sent eyebrows soaring in disbelief by advancing to the semi-finals, having first surpassed their own and worldwide expectations by making it to the final eight. With the benefit of home advantage and plenty of luck, Guus Hiddink\u2019s side won no end of admirers as they advanced through the knockout stages at the expense of Italy and Spain before running out of road against Germany. In any other year, the manner in which Turkey made it to the other 2002 semi-final, albeit at the expense of less vaunted opponents, only to lose against Brazil would have been fairly sensational news. In a tournament comparatively full of surprises, the USA also made it to the quarter-finals of South Korea and Japan 2002.\nIn the four tournaments played since, only Ukraine (2006), Ghana and Paraguay (2010), Costa Rica (2010) and arguably Sweden (2018) have looked to have notions above their stations by making it to the quarter-finals and not one of those surprise packages made it any further, with all eventually going out to more streetwise, often wilier and simply better sides. Despite not being in the top 20 of Fifa\u2019s international rankings, Morocco have bucked the trend in knocking out Spain to take their place in a last eight otherwise full of familiar faces for the first time in their history. Having conceded just one goal \u2013 an unlucky own goal \u2013 in their past eight games, this obdurate side from north Africa could go even further and will take some beating. BG\nTalking points\nHakimi holds nerve for box-office momentAchraf Hakimi booked Morocco\u2019s place in the quarter-finals with one of the great major-tournament penalties. After playing his part in a magnificent defensive display against Spain, and having already seen his teammate Hakim Ziyech belt his own shootout spot-kick down the middle, the Madrid-born defender dinked the ball into the back of the net with an effort that Andrea Pirlo \u2013 or indeed Antonin Panenka \u2013 would have been proud of. His celebration was right up there, too, jigging happily on the spot as he awaited the arrival of his on-rushing teammates. Nerveless? No. There were certainly nerves. But after one deep breath, a last moment to focus, Hakimi sent Morocco into the last eight. It was sensational coolness under pressure, and will go down as one of the most memorable moments of a drama-packed tournament. LMc\nRamos seizes moment for rampant PortugalGon\u00e7alo Ramos\u2019s opening goal flashed past Yann Sommer and into the top corner before Switzerland\u2019s goalkeeper had a chance to move. The Swiss defenders all looked around in disbelief, wondering how they had fallen a goal behind in the blink of an eye. Fabian Sch\u00e4r could have done more to block the shot, and Sommer was beaten at his near post, but the strike was so sweet and powerful it was a moment simply to praise Ramos\u2019s technique and opportunism. By the end of the night, with six goals scored, Portugal had rocketed to somewhere near the top of the rankings of potential tournament winners and Ramos had seized his moment by scoring this World Cup\u2019s first hat-trick. When the Portugal squad massed by the corner flag to celebrate that rocket of an opener, Cristiano Ronaldo was just another face in the crowd. As this rate he will need to get used to it. LMc\nBeyond the football\nThere were troubling scenes outside the Education City Stadium before and during the Morocco v Spain match, with fans of the African nation unable to gain entry for the last-16 tie. Journalists reported that there was the risk of a crush when the stadium entrance was closed midway inside the first half and a flashpoint when an officer fell off a horse amid chaotic scenes near a chainlink fence. Fans said by organisers to be ticketless tried to get past a security cordon but were pushed back by police and security forces. It was reported that the situation calmed down when many fans outside chose to watch on their mobile phones. GB\nGlobal media-watch\nThe exits of both Japan and South Korea in quick succession left Asia without a representative in the World Cup\u2019s last eight, but press reaction domestically has mostly viewed the defeats through the prism that reaching the last 16 was an achievement in itself.\nIn the Hankyoreh in South Korea, there was a lament for the pressure the schedule had put the team under compared to Brazil. \u201cThe World Cup was held while the European leagues were in progress, affecting the duration of the tournament,\u201d the newspaper said. \u201cThe Korean players, who had no choice but to put up with the tight schedule, suffered from physical exhaustion. Brazil changed most of the starting lineup in the third round of the group stage.\u201d\nThe Kyunghyang Shinmun had reporters on the streets of Seoul where fans gathered to watch at 4am in temperatures of -4C. \u201cCitizens who filled the plaza three hours before the start of the game melted the cold with cup noodles and hot coffee,\u201d it noted, adding: \u201cIt snowed quite a bit from the end of the first half, but the enthusiasm for cheering was not dampened.\u201d There was no indication on whether there was a noodle shower when South Korea scored.\n\nThe Japan Times said that after the wins over Spain and Germany, \u201cthe international soccer community should be taking note of how this Japan side isn\u2019t another flash in the pan\u201d. Dan Orlowitz reckoned: \u201cOver four games at this tournament, the Samurai Blue\u2019s performances showcased some of their greatest strengths \u2013 and exposed their most glaring weaknesses,\u201d and said: \u201cIt\u2019s now hoped that Monday\u2019s heartbreak will drive many of the 19 players at their first World Cup to bring the team to the promised land of the quarter-finals and beyond.\u201d MB\nThe internet reacts \nRoy Keane continued his quest to make friends all over the world with his disparaging remarks about Brazil\u2019s dance celebrations on Monday. TNT Sports BR were not the only people to compare Keane\u2019s remarks that the dancing was \u201cdisrespectful\u201d to his own actions during his career, but with over five million followers on Twitter their flashback to that Keane tackle on Alfe Inge Haaland will have had more reach than most.\n\nNot everybody quite hit the mark. One outraged tweet suggested that Keane had been born into a society where people don\u2019t dance because they don\u2019t know how to express themselves. Quite a difficult take on Irish culture to explain to Michael Flatley, one imagines.\nStill, at least one bunch of internet killjoys were impressed. The self-styled official celebration police of the World Cup have promoted Keane to an honorary role as chief constable, complete with a lovely British police hat. Keane will surely love that. MB\n\nToday\u2019s live coverage\nIt\u2019s the first of two rest days in Qatar but we\u2019ll have rolling World Cup news between 9am and 5pm GMT and be sure to get your live football fix with the Guardian\u2019s minute-by-minute coverage of Arsenal v Juventus in the Women\u2019s Champions League at 8pm.\nAnd finally \u2026\nOlivier Giroud impressed in his France press conference by switching between English, French and Italian to answer a variety of questions on subjects ranging from his thoughts on Harry Kane and Didier Deschamps\u2019 tactics to what he made of the mocked-up images of his and Kylian Mbapp\u00e9\u2019s bromantic on-pitch embrace in the 3-1 win against Poland. \u201cThere is nothing calculated about the photo, it was a really nice photo and the Photoshops have made me laugh. Sport makes us live amazing things and it wasn\u2019t a winning goal in a final but it was important,\u201d he said, in case you\u2019re wondering. After half an hour of holding court, remaining cheery and unruffled, perhaps there is a job as a press officer for the striker when he hangs up his boots. GB"

                    "body": "The propaganda war playing out in the background of Iran\u2019s World Cup campaign continued on Tuesday night, but fears of ugly scenes at the Al Thumama stadium failed to materialise.\nThe players sang the national anthem, some through gritted teeth, to a backdrop of whistles from the stands. Supporters smuggled in personal protests, the words \u201cwomen life freedom\u201d printed on T-shirts hidden under T-shirts and scrawled in marker pen on their bodies.\nBut despite an increase in security, with dozens of police standing behind the goal where Iran supporters were gathered, there was no apparent widespread intervention. One report suggested two female fans had a flag of Persia taken off them by security. Meanwhile, an American was grabbed by security for wearing a rainbow armband, the item Fifa had once assured visitors would not cause any problems with Qatari officials. After the game a male Iran fan was taken away by security while shouting \u201cWomen, life, freedom\u201d.\n\nThe scale of protest was intimate but widespread and there was much complexity, too. An emigr\u00e9 contingent among the Iranian support was substantial. It included one woman, who gave her name as Ayesha, who said she had had an Iran shirt taken from her by security during the match against Wales. This time, the second generation Iranian-American was wearing a USA shirt with \u201cwomen life freedom\u201d on it instead.\nNil, an Iranian living in Doha, had the same message on her shirt, just above a knot that was tied around her stomach and bared her midriff. She, like many female Iranian fans at the stadium, was not wearing a hijab, but pointed out that even those who did might be supportive of the protests. \u201cSome will not wear it, but it\u2019s not about just that. Women cannot buy, they cannot work, it is more.\u201d\n\nThere were also young women without hijabs who were vocally denouncing the protesters, saying they should go home. Part of what appeared to be an organised group, they attempted to put themselves in front of the cameras that were outside the ground. One man in their number, Ali, said he lived in Canada, and that politics should keep out of football.\nAsked what he would say to a woman protesting for her freedom, he said: \u201cBe more patient. We do not need a revolution; when we have a revolution things go downhill. There is more instability, there is a power vacuum. We have to take it step by step.\u201d\nThere were also rumours of \u201cplants\u201d, fake actors paid to muddy the waters with insincere messaging. And while much of the protest was focused on the Iranian regime, there were other messages too. Two women stood with a laminated placard protesting against US sanctions against the country, apparently protected for a while by members of security. And alongside the flag of the Islamic Republic and the star spangled banner a third flag was highly visible, too: that of Palestine.\nAs supporters gathered and slowly began their journey inside the ground, a young woman in a burka sped back and forth between them on roller skates, a giant Palestinian flag trailing behind her."

                    "body": "Match of the tournament\nThere is the temptation to pick a leftfield choice from the 18 games I covered, but who are we kidding: the final was stunning, jaw-dropping sport and the best match of its type there has ever been. Nick Ames\nArgentina\u2019s penalty shootout victory over the Netherlands felt impossible to supersede in the drama stakes but the final turned into the most preposterous and gripping of games. Morocco\u2019s win over Portugal, which culminated in Sofiane Boufal dancing pitchside with his mother after they became the first African team to the reach the semi-finals, was pretty special too. Ben Fisher\nArgentina v France. My heart was pounding so much I had a headache. Bryan Armen Graham\nThe final. An all-time classic with a deserving winner. Andy Hunter\nThe final. When Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 sliced inside from the left on 71 minutes and lifted high, I remember thinking two things. Blimey, Mbapp\u00e9 hasn\u2019t done much. And, I\u2019m pleased that my live piece is all sorted. Neither sentiment aged well. David Hytner\n\nIt\u2019s impossible to surpass the drama of the last 40 minutes of the World Cup final, even if the proceeding 80 were strangely listless. Argentina\u2019s shootout win over the Netherlands, which was nearly as thrilling and had 17 yellow cards and a red, will also linger long in the memory. Sean Ingle\nThe World Cup final. Scintillating. The Lionel Messi and Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 slugfest was a riveting watch studded with operatic drama. What a way for Qatar 2022 (on the pitch) to bow out. Jamie Jackson\nOne stands out for many reasons, Netherlands v Argentina. The dramatic finish, the utter chaos, the referee losing the plot etc, etc. Tom Jenkins\nRarely does a final challenge for this spot but this one had all the ingredients: six goals including a hat-trick once France finally woke up, extra time, penalties, Messi v Mbapp\u00e9, Messi full stop. It\u2019s tough to rival the aggro rollercoaster that was Argentina\u2019s quarter-final win over the Netherlands, but the final was a match for the ages. Emma Kemp\nArgentina v France was possibly the match of any tournament. Jonathan Liew\nDespite being ignored, at best, by everyone, I really enjoyed the third-place playoff. South Korea v Ghana was great fun. Spain v Germany was superb, and it\u2019s a pity neither were here for very long. But nothing compares to the final \u2013 and may never compare to it either. Even if it\u2019s not quite so enjoyable if you\u2019re trying to work out what the bloody hell to write. Just absurdly brilliant. What a way to go. Sid Lowe\nThe final, obviously, but a lot of the games I attended left a mark. I\u2019ll pick Japan v Spain because it was late at night, which always adds atmosphere, and the way the Samurai Blue turned over the exquisitely groomed Spaniards in a five-minute dose of extreme football absolutely took the breath away. Paul MacInnes\nSerbia v Switzerland. A bit going on. Sub-texts. Super-texts. Granit Xhaka\u2019s balls. All of it taking place in a cod-hipster parody shed made out of painted steel shabby chic sea containers. Barney Ronay\nI thought England v France was good. Then I saw the final. It was quite possibly the best game of football ever. Jacob Steinberg\nThe final had everything but my personal favourite \u2013 because I was there \u2013 was Poland\u2019s 2-0 win against Saudi Arabia in the group stage. The unadorned scoreline does not do justice to Saudi Arabia\u2019s pronounced first-half dominance in front of fanatical massed support at Education City. Let alone Wojciech Szczesny\u2019s incredible double save featuring the initial repelling of Salem al-Dawsari\u2019s penalty. Or the sight of an emotional Robert Lewandowski scoring his first goal at a World Cup finals and subsequently shedding tears of joy. Louise Taylor\nBefore the final, I\u2019d have said for quality, England v France; for drama Netherlands v Argentina. But the final was one of the greatest of all games, a game that defies description, a game that will be talked about for as long as football is played. Jonathan Wilson\n\nPlayer of the tournament\nAgain, no point trying to be too clever: it is Lionel Messi, for what he actually did as well as the emotion and symbolism behind finally getting his hands on the trophy. Messi was on a mission throughout and, a penalty miss against Poland aside, was virtually note-perfect in every action. It was a tournament in which the greats delivered, but new legends were also created: Morocco\u2019s Sofyan Amrabat was the best midfielder while his teammate Azzedine Ounahi was the breakout star. Josko Gvardiol and, gloriously, Luka Modric shone for a fine Croatia. NA\nBeyond the ubiquitous all-singing, all-dancing mobility marshals \u2013 \u201cStadium? This way!\u201d \u2013 the obvious suspects. The sight of Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 activating full tilt really is quite something but he came up with the goods too. Azzedine Ounahi and Sofyan Amrabat were immense in midfield for Morocco. BF\nLionel Messi. BG\nLionel Messi. Majestic under incredible pressure. Wrote the perfect script. AH\nMessi. Next question. DH\nA dead heat between Lionel Messi and Kylian Mbapp\u00e9, with Antoine Griezmann third. SI\nLionel Messi. Sport is fairytales and folklore. The boy from Rosario is now 35 but still played like the boy from Rosario. JJ\nI suppose the obvious would be to plump for Lionel Messi given he has been absolutely brilliant. My leftfield choice, someone I knew nothing about before coming here, would be Morocco\u2019s Sofyan Amrabat. What a presence he has been. That tackle on Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 in the semi-final \u2013 just wow. TJ\n\nWho else but Lionel Messi? Before the final, part of me wanted to pick Antoine Griezmann for his inventive and tireless reincarnation in the midfield, and where to even start with Kylian Mbapp\u00e9? But we all know the real star of the show is Argentina\u2019s ageless wonder. Messi was the inspiration to his country\u2019s triumph in a similar way Diego Maradona was at Mexico 1986 \u2013 except that Maradona was 25 then and Messi 35 now. Seven goals, three assists and a trophy make this World Cup the ultimate embellishment to a peerless career. EK\nHas any player defied the odds so spectacularly at such an advanced age? Has any player wanted or needed it this much? Yes: in many ways this was Olivier Giroud\u2019s World Cup. JL\nSofyan Amrabat and Azzedine Ounahi \u2013 \u201cMama mia, where did your No 8 come from?\u201d as Luis Enrique put it \u2013 were brilliant. Antoine Griezmann perhaps. And Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 did something very, very special. But come on, it\u2019s Lionel Messi. At 35, for goodness sake. SL\nIt\u2019s Messi, obviously, ahead of Mbapp\u00e9 because not only did he score and create he was the conduit too. But if you don\u2019t mind I\u2019ll name my favourite player: Achraf Hakimi. A class operator in both directions who affected matches consistently from right-back and was an inspirational leader of a historic Moroccan side. Pretty darn handsome too. PM\nEr. Lionel Messi. What kind of question is this? BR\nAn honorable nod to those who made getting it launched a thing again: Niclas F\u00fcllkrug and Wout Weghorst. Yes, Antoine Griezmann was class. But come on, nothing compares with Messi in the mood. JS\nMuch as I\u2019m tempted to vote for Croatia\u2019s Luka Modric \u2013 a truly wonderful footballer still excelling at 37 \u2013 the winner has to be Iran\u2019s Ehsan Hajsafi. Admittedly he failed to progress beyond the group stage but the national captain\u2019s extreme bravery in publicly supporting his compatriots\u2019 protests against the brutal theocratic regime in Tehran and its imposition of the compulsory hijab for women mattered much more than the outcome of any match. LT\n\nLionel Messi. Come on \u2026 who else could it be? The discrete moments of previous tournaments cohered into a brilliant whole, with the most preposterous denouement. JW\nGoal of the tournament\nCounterattacks do not come much faster, more controlled or more clinical than the one \u00c1ngel Di Mar\u00eda finished off in the final. But then volleys rarely come as technically masterful as Kylian Mbapp\u00e9\u2019s equaliser much, much later. In fact, Argentina were on the end of the most audacious goal: it seems aeons ago now but the Netherlands\u2019 late free-kick, finished by Wout Weghorst, could have shifted the month\u2019s entire narrative. NA\nRicharlison v South Korea: a sumptuous move that just screamed Brazil, as did the celebration. His volley against Serbia was not bad either. BF\nRicharlison\u2019s preposterous bicycle kick against Serbia. BG\nWas torn between Richarlison\u2019s v Serbia or Richarlison\u2019s v South Korea until \u00c1ngel Di Mar\u00eda finished off that glorious one-touch move in the final. Wonderful. AH\nWout Weghorst\u2019s equaliser against Argentina. Fine finish but made by the sheer balls of Teun Koopmeiners to do what he did. Imagine the inquest if the Argentina wall had read his intentions and simply cleared! DH\nGiven the stakes, Mbapp\u00e9\u2019s beautiful volley against Argentina just pips Richarlison\u2019s self-made scissor kick against Serbia with Vincent Aboubakar\u2019s lob-wedge chip against the same team third. SI\n\nMessi\u2019s second in the final: a classic goalsniffer\u2019s, in the 18th minute of extra time, underlined for an umpteenth time how much he adores being out there, in the fight. JJ\nSalem al-Dawsari scoring the second Saudi Arabia goal v Argentina. When his curling shot flew into the top corner, you didn\u2019t just feel the stadium reverberate, you felt the whole tournament shake. TJ\nRicharlison\u2019s second in Brazil\u2019s group-stage win over Serbia. The trivela cross, the first touch, the scissor finish \u2013 every element is beautiful. One to watch on slow-motion repeat. EK\nRicharlison has two legitimate contenders here. His bicycle kick against Serbia was brilliant, but I\u2019m more drawn to the juggle and shuffle against South Korea that combined glorious teamwork with individual flourish. JL\nThe best goals were the ones that turned out not to be goals at all. Imagine if these had gone in: Aziz Behich\u2019s run against Argentina, Jawad El Yamiq\u2019s overhead kick off the post against France, I\u00f1aki Williams sneaking up behind the keeper in the last minute. But if those don\u2019t count \u2013 and they quite literally don\u2019t \u2013 it\u2019s probably Brazilian. I probably like Neymar against Croatia even more than Richarlison. Actually, for the assist, it should be Nahuel Molina or Juli\u00e1n \u00c1lvarez, made in Messi. SL\nUnlike some of the other categories, this one is actually up for debate: from the Dutch 21-pass opener against the USA, to Messi\u2019s Gvardiol-abusing assist and Mbapp\u00e9\u2019s superstar volley in the final. I\u2019m going to go for Hwang Hee-chan\u2019s goal for South Korea against Portugal. It really was a hail mary moment, the last move of the match and Korea \u2013 who had barely created an opportunity all game \u2013 had to score to have a chance of the knockouts. Son Heung-min recognised the power of this moment and \u2013 despite being some way short of match fitness \u2013 used every piece of skill and cunning and strength he could find to drag the ball the length of the pitch before playing Hwang in blind for the Wolves man to finish in ice-cold fashion. Sumptuous. PM\nSalem al-Dawsari\u2019s winner against Argentina. Just a sensational jink, shot, flip and yodelling celebration. Gulf geopolitics angle: they went mental in the Red Umbrella coffee shop with Qataris and fellow Arabs cheering a Saudi win. BR\nBig Wout\u2019s equaliser against Argentina. What a moment. JS\nBreel Embolo against Cameroon. It was a straightforward six-yard finish but few goals prove more evocative. Although Embolo, the scorer at the Al Janoub Stadium, grew up in Basel he was born in Yaounde and his heart remains very much in Cameroon where he funds a charity foundation and is close friends with Rigobert Song, the national coach. Embolo\u2019s goal spelt immense disappointment for the initially dominant Africans but, afterwards, it was uplifting to hear a magnanimous Song express his delight for \u201cmy little brother Breel\u201d. Post-match press conferences rarely feel more sporting. LT\n\nNeymar\u2019s goal against Croatia was stunning but, for the Messi pass that created it, I\u2019ll go for Nahuel Molina\u2019s goal against the Netherlands. JW\nPersonal highlight\nBeing present to watch such an era-defining final was an unforgettable privilege although, at Lusail and other venues, there was always the thought of the sacrifices made to make sure we could. Working for a month alongside extraordinarily diligent, talented, big-hearted colleagues and friends is an honour even if the main media centre and its endless stream of friendly, sometimes careworn faces was not always a fount of productivity. A number had been converted to Shebestan Palace, a peerless Iranian restaurant perfect for removing oneself from the World Cup circus, by the end. NA\nShould be something about covering my first World Cup but has to be playing seven-a-side against Roy Keane and Gary Neville. Will for ever dine out on Ian Wright informing me I have, and I quote, a \u201cgreat touch for a big man\u201d. Conquering all three floors of the infamous (among journalists at least) local LuLu hypermarket, where laptops and wireless headphones are sold adjacent to Weetabix, on my final day comes a close second. BF\nToo many. Watching Brazil live. Hanging with the Senegalese fans at Souq Waqif. A most unusual Thanksgiving dinner in the world\u2019s largest hotel shaped like a torch. Iran 0-1 Great Satan. Going to the camel races in Al Shahaniya. Seeing an African team finally make the last four. BG\nSeeing Saudi Arabia supporters absolutely losing it inside Lusail Stadium following their team\u2019s shock win over the eventual world champions. AH\nThe final. Or maybe the legendary Lulu Centre, department store and destination of choice for the discerning Al Sadd denizen. DH\nFeeling the 974 Stadium rattle as 40,000 Argentinians jumped up and down after they went 2-0 up against Poland was incredible. As was being on the Metro at 3am, and seeing Saudi Arabian fans talking to Americans, Moroccans and Mexicans singing, and a Portuguese supporter carrying a large cardboard cutout of Cristiano Ronaldo. All on the same carriage. At such moments the lofty words about the tournament being a bridge between east and west felt real. SI\nGoing into my local Lulu\u2019s supermarket in Al Sadd and discovering they had Marmite. TJ\nThere are two for me. One was witnessing Messi\u2019s ludicrous brilliance in the flesh, at likely his last World Cup. The other was seeing Australia make the last 16, which was very cool and unexpected. EK\n\nArgentina v Saudi Arabia was an unforgettable occasion, and the point at which this World Cup began to challenge the received narrative. JL\nSitting on a plastic chair pitchside watching Santi Cazorla play and Juanma Lillo coach in a preseason friendly for Al Sadd. Not getting injured (too badly) playing football in Al Bidda park. Meeting peregrine falcons. Meeting Colo Mac Allister. I\u00f1aki Williams\u2019 enthusiasm. The wild liberation of Messi scoring against Mexico: we\u2019ve seen that goal loads of times, but not that celebration. The night when watching Brazil was just like watching Brazil. And the final of course. One other thing: watching all the Bono puns roll in with the smug satisfaction of a man who is a long, long way ahead of you all and did those years ago. SL\nOff-field: running in the 7am sun each morning under blue Doha skies with house music in the earphones. On field: the harum-scarum night at Lusail Stadium where Mexico (apparently) had zero chance of progressing but went 2-0 up against Saudi Arabia after 52 minutes and seriously close to the third that would have made the evening a sensation. JJ\nI asked my editors if I could do an Argentina game because I had never seen Messi live. They let me do two. Thanks bosses! PM\nGianni Infantino\u2019s opening address. Just so many zingers. Never before in the grand storied history of the Qatar National Convention Centre Hall One have so many dropping jaws and boggling eyes been witnessed. A wake-up call. The 1960s had its Beatles-on-the-Ed-Sullivan-Show moment. Qatar 2022 had a middle-aged Swiss sports administrator saying \u201ctoday I feel gay, disabled and African\u201d. BR\n\nTraining my focus on Messi during Argentina 2-0 Poland. At one point he was the highest Argentina player and right up against Poland\u2019s back four. But as the play progressed Messi just stood still. Ten seconds later Argentina were in the final third, Poland\u2019s defenders had retreated to the edge of their box and Messi was in acres of space. His teammates soon got him the ball. JS\nBeing at Stadium 974 to watch Lionel Messi miss a penalty but turn the tide Argentina\u2019s way as Poland were beaten 2-0 in an initially tense, ultimately one sided, group stage match. As he slalomed his way through formidable-looking Polish defensive chicanes it was easy to appreciate why, at times, almost every other person in Doha seemed to be wearing a replica Argentina No 10 Messi shirt. Well after 2am \u2013 a good couple of hours after the final whistle \u2013 the city\u2019s excellent and astonishingly efficient Metro system remained crammed by exultant South Americans still high on their hero\u2019s exquisite skills. LT\n\nThe best World Cup experiences are often the games you\u2019re not working on but watch with friends and colleagues. I was done for the day before Spain v Japan and Germany v Costa Rica and so was able to watch them in the media centre amid the nearest a Qatari media centre comes to a raucous atmosphere. JW\nWhat did you make of Qatar?\nPretty much what I expected to. Everybody has to start somewhere but the shortcuts Qatar has taken, and the tragic collateral damage involved, to create a hyper-modern environment and tournament where little felt honest or real sat uncomfortably every day. We have to take seriously the fact that thousands of supporters from countries like Morocco, other MENA states and Argentina had an excellent time. The opening of new doors cannot be ignored and, if it does help football and society in the long term, will have been important. But too many others were deterred for reasons those at the top have brushed off, often disgracefully, and the overall experience seemed unsatisfactory unless you like your fun spoon-fed, marshalled, defused of spontaneity, laced with artifice and slathered with ear-splitting music at every turn. If this was the best on-pitch World Cup then that was thanks to the teams and players, with Qatar the accessory \u2013 because make no mistake, in most other aspects it was the worst in memory and the contest is not even close. NA\nUnnervingly clean, architecturally spectacular. The naturally sparkling Hamad International airport is awash with luxury brands from Harrods to Louis Vuitton but could do with somewhere to buy a fridge magnet \u2026 BF\nThe sparkling new stadiums, training facilities and Metro system will strengthen Doha\u2019s inevitable pitch to host the 2036 Summer Olympics, supplying the proof-of-concept their failed 2016, 2020 and 2032 bids lacked. I suspect we\u2019ll be back here before we know it. BG\nThe tournament exceeded all expectations; the place lived down to them. A soulless and unsettling police state. Welcome to the future. AH\nIt didn\u2019t feel like a typical World Cup. But the incredible friendliness of the migrant workers and volunteers helped make it work. And it was nowhere near as oppressive as some places I have worked, including Saudi Arabia and China. SI\nFlat, conservative, low on fun. Totally lacking a World Cup vibe because the native Qataris did not care. I remember having dinner with Sean Ingle on the night of Spain v Japan and watching the game on one of the restaurant\u2019s big screens. At a super-dramatic point, two local guys bumped into each other and started a long chat bang in front of the TV. There was the walkalong Lusail boulevard after Argentina v Croatia. Argentina had just reached the World Cup final but their fans milled about looking bored, as the same ear-bleeding song from Fifa\u2019s Official Album (TM) blared on loop. There was no escape. The feeling seemed to be: \u201cWe will create atmosphere, World Cup fever.\u201d It was so forced and artificial. The football was really good, there were logistical upsides to a one-city tournament (if we overlook the appalling Al Bayt) and the organising committee surely tried to tick every box. On paper, they did. In practice, there was something missing. DH\n\nGleaming stadiums, spanking new Metro, sparkling lights, and next-generation skyscrapers yet all made to feel as part of a strange toy-town because even with the World Cup touching down there are too few souls about. JJ\nWhich Qatar are we talking about here, the real one or the World Cup version? For the past month I\u2019ve only really seen the latter, tucked away in a bubble. Logistically, covering this World Cup has been brilliant, so much easier than any I have covered before. Eight incredible stadiums, very close together, all with wonderful transport links, all staffed with terrific volunteers. The organisation has been first class but when money is literally no object I think you could and should expect that. However this Qatar should always have a \u201cBUT\u201d put next to it, and it\u2019s a very big BUT. TJ\n\nA heartless, juvenile and genuinely awful place built on witless wealth, modern slavery and old-fashioned racism. Glad I went. Gladder still that I got to leave. JL\nThree games, three defeats. Fans leaving halfway through. Pretty bad, then. SL\nI don\u2019t like to be rude about hosts so let\u2019s just say it wasn\u2019t for me. PM\nThe strangest place on Earth. Modern life as reinterpreted at 400mph by an endlessly enabled hyper-competent megalomaniac. BR\nMy accreditation gave me free travel on the Metro and the possibility of going to every game. Smiling volunteers greeted me at England\u2019s training base, which is where I spent most days. I was in a media bubble and so, while some journalists have left Qatar saying: \u201cWhat\u2019s everyone complaining about, I was treated really well,\u201d to think I had a real insight into the country would be pretty misguided. What I did find, though, is that some migrant workers didn\u2019t want to say anything negative. People doing manual labour were unnervingly cheerful. As for the atmosphere, the streets were often empty and there wasn\u2019t much to do when the football wasn\u2019t on. My experience was fine. That doesn\u2019t mean people who are less fortunate than me are having a great time. JS\nGiven that joining a \u201cWorld Cup bubble\u201d is akin to entering Narnia, impressions will inevitably be superficial and heavily caveated. It\u2019s a parallel universe where normal life is suspended. It felt good the Middle East finally had a World Cup and that Morocco and, initially, Saudi Arabia, gave the Arab football world something to shout about. And yet \u2026 admiration of the undeniably striking stadium architecture was tarnished beyond measure by the human cost involved in constructing those arenas. What an appalling waste of so many lives in a country awash with so much money. Paradoxes abounded: I felt considerably safer after dark in Doha than in many UK cities but was acutely aware that women\u2019s rights in Qatar are severely restricted. And without female equality it is impossible to see how societies can truly succeed, let alone diversify. LT\nThe Metro was good until it collapsed under the pressure of big Argentina knockout games at the Lusail. The stadiums were fine. The Main Media Centre was exceptional. But this was a terrible venue for a World Cup, for every reason we knew about before the tournament, and a lot we\u2019ve learned over the past month. Arbitrary governance in weird artificial landscape does not make for a good venue. JW"

                    "body": "Two days out from the World Cup final, Qatar finishes hosting its tournament having very recently been declared \u201ca frontrunner in labour rights\u201d. \u201cToday,\u201d the declaration in question continued, \u201cthe World Cup in Qatar is proof of how sports diplomacy can achieve a historic transformation of a country.\u201d\nIt feels only mildly unfortunate that the member of the European parliament who uttered these words three weeks ago is currently detained by Belgian police, after the discovery of almost \u20ac1m in banknotes in her marital home and a hotel room used by her father. After all, this has been a successful World Cup. Qatar has catapulted itself on to the world stage and won many plaudits. This timing is merely a freak coincidence.\nIn his closing speech, I hope Fifa\u2019s president Gianni Infantino returns to a familiar rhetorical furrow, and riffs: \u201cToday, I feel in police custody in Brussels. Today, I feel like an MEP with a suitcase of cash in her home. Today, I feel I am that MEP who denies any involvement in an alleged bribery and corruption scheme which also features the Moroccan intelligence services. Today, I feel I am the MEP\u2019s husband who is reported to have confessed his role working for Qatar\u2019s government.\u201d\nBefore we go on, I should of course say there has never been any incontrovertible evidence uncovered that links Qatar to corruption in the manner it secured its World Cup. The arrests in Brussels last week are alleged to relate to Qatar\u2019s attempts to bag an aviation deal and visa-free travel to the bloc. There is no smoking gun on Qatar\u2019s successful bid, and Fifa\u2019s no-doubt crack ethics committee found nothing in its investigations. The desert state would prefer you focus solely on its jubilation in that 2010 footage of Sepp Blatter opening the envelope revealing the word \u201cQatar\u201d, while the cameras picked up representatives of England\u2019s failed 2018 bid, including David Beckham, looking sad and shrugging. Beckham himself has since found a reported \u00a3150m from Qatar to cheer him up. So, you know \u2013 every cloud.\n\nIt seems odd now to think back to the Fifa arrests of 2015. At the time, it was the biggest story out there \u2013 so big that you could hardly believe what you were seeing. It ran and ran \u2013 until the massive political shocks of 2016 eclipsed it entirely, and it suddenly seemed like some quaint old cops-and-robbers tale from a different time.\nBut back then we were gripped. Time and again I go back to that image of staff at Zurich\u2019s five-star Baur au Lac hotel, where Fifa executives were staying on the eve of its annual congress, dutifully holding up bed sheets to shield the suspects after they\u2019d been arrested in the dawn raid by the Swiss authorities at the behest of the FBI. It\u2019s not so much that the Fifa executives were literally being led out under their own dirty linen \u2013 though there\u2019s definitely that. It\u2019s the continuing level of respect.\n\nI have stayed in the odd fancy hotel over the years. If, however, I was arrested in one of them, I simply can\u2019t get my head around the process that would lead to me still being treated as a valued customer even as I was led out to the police van. I mean, what do you do to get that service? Ring down to the concierge and say: \u201cGood morning. Couple of things. One, the hollandaise on my eggs benedict was a bit tepid this morning. Not happy. And two, I\u2019ve just been arrested on behalf of the FBI. Can you send up someone in a tailcoat to hold some linen around me while I\u2019m hauled off?\u201d You would think, guest-services-speaking, that you were on your own at that point. And yet, bedsheets borne by footmen were forthcoming. It feels a testament to the fact there really was no better customer than Fifa. And there still isn\u2019t.\nAs for last week\u2019s arrests, they allege Qatar\u2019s continuing attempts to curry global influence. Some of these are in plain sight. A number of British MPs have accepted travel gifts and hospitality from the Doha regime, with \u00a3260,000 showered on 36 MPs in the past year alone. Faced with renewed interest on these unfortunate declarations of interest after the Belgian raids, some beneficiaries are sticking to their guns. The Conservative backbencher Jackie Doyle-Price, who took \u00a37,374 in travel and hospitality, insists: \u201cIt is precisely to challenge them on their human rights record that we go on these trips.\u201d\nI sort of love this idea \u2013 that an autocratic regime which has repeatedly demonstrated its total disregard for human rights would lay on lavish all\u2011expenses\u2011paid trips for no-mark foreign politicians and then, when some irrelevant member for West Bollockshire raises the issue of migrant worker deaths in between bites of the Arabian oryx steak it paid for, decide that it should change its ways. As Labour\u2019s regretful Chris Bryant, who himself accepted hospitality, put it: \u201cThey didn\u2019t want to listen and it felt all wrong.\u201d Well, yes.\nSo if it feels ridiculously on the nose that this Brussels raid should take place in the closing stages of Qatar\u2019s World Cup, that\u2019s just the game. You expect sensational upsets, but winning eyes remain on the prize. After the Belgian arrests, a member of the Strasbourg parliament intoned: \u201cWe are standing in the middle of a crime scene\u201d. Big deal. For the past month, we\u2019ve been watching the biggest sports event in the world take place in the middle of one.\nThere has not been a single conviction despite, reportedly, thousands of labourer deaths. Nothing has changed, because the system works. There will always be people like Beckham willing to hold up the metaphorical bedsheets and the caravan will always move on. Whoever wins out of Argentina and France, the ultimate winner has been Qatar. It got away with it."

                    "body": "Hours before the World Cup final in Qatar, a diplomatic delegation from the three host countries of the 2026 World Cup \u2013 Canada, Mexico and the United States \u2013 met with dignitaries in the coastal city of Doha to hand over responsibility for the 2026 edition of the tournament.\nThe delegation, represented by Canada\u2019s transport minister Omar Alghabra, US ambassador to the United Nations Linda Thomas-Greenfield and Mexican Football Federation president Yon de Luisa, were photographed receiving a ceremonial ball from Sheikh Joaan bin Hamad Al Thani, president of the Qatar Olympic Committee. The symbolic gesture signaled the closing stages of one of the most controversial sporting events in modern history \u2013 an event marked by show-stopping soccer, appalling human rights abuses, and dystopian displays of wealth and luxury.\nAnd despite accusations of bribery, abuses of migrant workers, and the criminalization of same-sex relationships, the wealthy Gulf peninsula succeeded in hosting the world\u2019s most popular sporting event, culminating in a thrilling match between France and Argentina that will be remembered as one of the best tournament finals in decades.\n\nNow, following back-to-back World Cups hosted by autocratic regimes in Russia and Qatar, the 2026 edition will signal the quadrennial tournament\u2019s return to democratic nations for the first time since 2014. While this may be a cause for relief and celebration for some, it is vital that sports journalists continue to apply the same critical lens they\u2019ve applied to Qatar to other host countries.\nFor years, journalists at the Guardian, among others, have been at the forefront of reporting on the intersection of politics at the World Cup in Qatar. From investigative pieces uncovering the exploitation of migrant workers and the resulting death toll to thoughtful pieces reflecting on the ways authoritarian states stand to benefit from hosting prestigious sports events, the reportage has helped breathe new life into sports journalism, rightfully demanding that reporters expand their coverage beyond what takes place on the pitch.\nHowever, the work should not end there.\nWhile it was easy to find fault in Qatar given its autocratic nature and well-documented human rights abuses, it is essential that those same journalists approach all future international sports events, including those in the Western world, with a similar critical lens in order to avoid the perception of hypocrisy, orientalism and journalistic posturing.\nFor example, the 2024 edition of the Uefa European Championships is scheduled to take place in Germany, a country that is currently in the midst of a socio-economic and energy crisis. Germany has also seen a rise in far-right extremism with nearly 24,000 far-right crimes recorded by police in 2020 alone. Official government reports have also found more than 300 cases of far-right extremism in Germany\u2019s top security agencies, further emphasizing the problem.\nLooking ahead to the 2026 World Cup \u2013 a tournament spanning 16 cities across three countries \u2013 there is no shortage of concerns worthy of critical journalism. The vast majority of the games will take place in the United States, a country that has withstood a tempestuous few years marred with an attempted insurrection, a marked increase in mass shootings, longstanding racial injustice towards Black Americans and people of color, and increasing legal regulation of gender minorities, including women and transpersons. Surely those subjects warrant coverage in the context of the 2026 World Cup.\nIt is also worth noting that while a portion of the critical coverage of this year\u2019s World Cup shed light on Qatar\u2019s criminalization of homosexuality, we, as journalists, would be remiss not to mention that the United States has seen a significant increase in attacks on the LGBTQ+ community. Back in May, US president Joe Biden warned of \u201cdisturbing setbacks and rising hate and violence\u201d targeting LGBTQ+ peoples. Biden\u2019s warning came amidst a slew of anti-LGBTQ+ bills being introduced in state legislature throughout the country, and only months before a mass shooting occurred at a LGBTQ+ nightclub in Colorado Springs left five people dead.\nMeanwhile, under a new directive from Texas governor Greg Abbott, families with trans kids are fleeing the state after facing child abuse investigations for providing gender-affirming care.\nThe United States is also not above criticism when it comes to the role the country plays in propping up authoritarian regimes around the world. This includes Qatar, a country that hosts the largest American military base in the Middle East and which Biden officially designated as a major non-Nato ally in a presidential declaration. The US even approved a $1bn arms deal with Qatar during the US men\u2019s national team World Cup match against Iran \u2013 an incident that went sorely underreported.\nNorth of the border in Canada, the situation is not much better. The second-largest nation in the world is currently reckoning with its colonial past and its systemic intergenerational oppression of Indigenous peoples, including the notorious residential school system, which involved the Canadian state forcibly removing Indigenous children from their families and communities and sequestering them in residential schools usually thousands of miles away from their home. These schools were rife with physical, sexual and emotional abuse, and have been described as sites of cultural genocide. The last of these schools was shut down in 1996.\nIn May 2021, a mass grave of 215 children was found at a residential school in British Columbia, one of the two provinces that will host matches at the 2026 World Cup. And despite its stated commitment to reconciliation, the Canadian government is yet to label its past treatment of Indigenous people as genocide.\nCanada is also under scrutiny for its treatment of migrant workers under the country\u2019s Temporary Foreign Worker program. Recent reports suggest that workers are poorly paid and abused while also being denied the rights afforded to Canadian residents and citizens. After years of reporting on Qatar\u2019s migrant worker\u2019s crisis, many sports journalists should now be adequately equipped to apply their skills to other societal contexts, including the West.\nThere are countless examples of concerns worthy of extensive reporting ahead of the 2026 tri-nation World Cup. And while each of the three host countries has repeatedly restated its commitment to human rights and democratic freedoms, it is crucial that sports journalists continue to hold their governments accountable. This is especially true as sports continue to have significant geo-political and socio-economic influence.\nOver the past decade, I have made a career of reporting on the intersection of sports and politics around the world. My reporting spans more than two dozen countries in six continents, covering everything from the beautiful game to the sweet science. Consequently, that experience has helped shape my understanding of the role that sports play in the modern political landscape. However, the most recent edition of the World Cup was the first time I felt the topic was part of a prevailing narrative rather than a one of niche consideration. I would like to believe that this profound shift is not a temporary one and that we will not return to the worn-out clich\u00e9 of keeping sports out of politics.\nIf we want the legacy of this World Cup to be a watershed moment in how we report on the intersection of sports and politics, it is vital that journalists continue to reflect and report on that intersection at the next World Cup and other future global sports events in democratic countries.\nWe have crossed the Rubicon. There is no turning back now."

                    "body": "Qatar has spent more money on gifts and trips for British MPs in the past year than any other country, according to Observer analysis that reveals the Gulf state\u2019s lobbying efforts ahead of next month\u2019s football World Cup. The Qatari government made gifts to members of parliament worth \u00a3251,208 in the 12 months to October 2022, including luxury hotel stays, business-class flights and tickets to horse-racing events. The value of Qatar\u2019s gifts was greater than the amount spent by the 15 other countries whose governments made donations to British MPs combined. And it was more than six times the \u00a337,661 in gifts and hospitality given to MPs by the United Arab Emirates, the second-highest foreign government donor. The gifts for the past 12 months also far outstripped those from Qatar in any other year for which records are available, revealing how authorities ramped up efforts to charm British MPs ahead of the World Cup. Records show MPs declared about \u00a3100,000 worth of gifts and hospitality from Qatar in the five years to October 2021, but more than double that in the last 12 months alone.  Transparency International said it was \u201cextremely concerning\u201d that MPs were accepting \u201cthousands of pounds worth of hospitality from foreign governments with questionable human rights records\u201d and that this could \u201cleave the door open to undue influence.\u201d There is no suggestion that any MP broke rules, however.  The Qatari government failed to respond to repeated requests for comment. In some cases, MPs who received freebies later appeared to speak favourably about Qatar in parliamentary debates, or to deflect attention away from issues that the authorities have been keen to downplay. During a debate about preparations for the World Cup earlier this month, Alun Cairns, who chairs an informal parliamentary group set up to \u201cfoster good relations between the UK and Qatar\u201d, made a speech praising Qatar, including \u201cpaying tribute\u201d to its response to the humanitarian crisis in Afghanistan. Cairns, Tory MP for the Vale of Glamorgan, initiated the debate on 20 October and later shared videos of it on Twitter alongside a Nelson Mandela quote: \u201cSport has the power to change the world.\u201d Records show he received \u00a39,323 worth of donations from the Qatari government in 2022, for a five-day trip in February to meet officials alongside other members of the Qatar all-party parliamentary group (APPG), and for a trip a month later to attend the Doha Forum policy event.  The APPG\u2019s deputy chair, David Mundell, who accepted hospitality worth \u00a37,473 from Qatar for a trip last October, also contributed to the debate, responding to a concern raised by another MP about LGBTQ rights in Qatar by saying critics should \u201cfocus their energies on the handling of LGBT issues in professional football in the UK\u201d \u2013 \u201cRather than simply point out issues that might arise in other countries, we still need to focus on issues at home,\u201d he said. Mundell, who was the first openly gay Conservative cabinet minister, also gave an interview to Qatar\u2019s state-run agency this year in which he criticised \u201cbaseless\u201d media coverage about a report into Qatar\u2019s record on worker rights. He did not mention the International Labour Organization\u2019s finding that \u201cdespite milestones being reached\u201d on worker rights in Qatar, there were \u201cgaps in implementation\u201d, nor its past research which found that 50 workers in Qatar lost their lives in 2020 alone, with over 500 severely injured and 37,600 suffering mild to moderate injuries. Both MPs referred to their declared interests during the parliamentary debate. Mundell did not respond to requests for comment. A statement from the Qatar APPG, provided via Cairns, said the group played an \u201cactive role in scrutinising all aspects of UK-Qatar relations, including human rights, ethics, education, energy and infrastructure\u201d. Details of Qatar\u2019s donations were revealed through analysis of declarations in the MPs register of interests. The records show 34 MPs declared 40 donations from Qatar in the year to October 2022. Of those, 22 MPs were Tory, seven were Labour, three were SNP and two were independent. Most of the money was spent on trips to Qatar for members of the Qatar APPG to meet ministers and government officials. During two trips, in October 2021 and February 2022, British MPs travelled to Qatar to discuss issues including \u201cpreparations for the World Cup, workers\u2019 rights reform and bilateral relations\u201d, as well as Qatar\u2019s \u201chumanitarian and political response to the Afghanistan crisis\u201d, transparency logs show.  The Qatari Ministry of Foreign Affairs paid for the all-inclusive visits, typically spending \u00a37,000 to \u00a38,000 per person for flights, hotels and meals during a seven-day trip. A source told the Observer that MPs on one trip were put up in luxury hotels with \u201cvast swimming pools\u201d and travelled business class on Qatar Airways. Some MPs were taken to a camel-racing event and had a private dinner with officials involved in the delivery of the Fifa World Cup. They said that MPs gave officials \u201ctwo barrels worth\u201d over issues, including LGBTQ rights, but that they were \u201cslick and charming\u201d and their goal was clear: \u201cTo improve Qatar\u2019s reputation in the world.\u201d \u201cIn particular, they wanted to minimise the criticism of their role in the World Cup,\u201d the source said. \u201cI came back equally critical. Maybe a couple would have been more sympathetic.\u201d The APPG did not comment on the claims that officials were given luxury treatment or say which government officials MPs met with during the trips, but said visits \u201cinclude meetings with a range of ministers and NGOs, including the UN Sponsored International Labour Organization\u201d. Qatar\u2019s Ministry of Culture and Sports, meanwhile, paid for two MPs to attend the Qatar-sponsored Goodwood festival in Sussex in July, according to the transparency records. The MPs were Sir John Whittingdale OBE, the Conservative MP and former culture secretary, who took a plus one and declared the gift as being worth \u00a31,200, and Nigel Evans, Conservative MP for the Ribble Valley. It was the third donation for Evans from Qatar in nine months. Neither Whittingdale nor Evans responded to requests for comment. The findings will fuel concerns about attempted backdoor lobbying by foreign governments in the UK. Other countries that have made donations to MPs in the past 12 months include Bahrain, Somaliland, Azerbaijan, San Marino and Kuwait. Lobbying by China and Russia has previously been exposed. Rose Whiffen, from Transparency International, said \u201ctoo many MPs\u201d were showing \u201cpoor judgment\u201d in accepting gifts from overseas administrations. She added that they must \u201cseriously consider if it is appropriate to accept these sorts of trips \u2013 not just whether they are allowed to.\u201d Chris Bryant, Labour MP and chair of the Commons Committee on Standards, has warned that parliament is \u201cparticularly vulnerable\u201d to foreign influence, saying during a debate in December that \u201cwe ought to be cognisant of the danger that a foreign power might be seeking to lobby \u2026 through the back door.\u201d Bryant is one of the MPs who accepted a donation in kind from Qatar in the form of an expenses-paid trip but told parliament in May that he regretted doing so. He has advocated for US-style rules which bar members of Congress from accepting donations and gifts from foreign governments. All visits abroad are paid for by Congress. Relations between the UK and Qatar have strengthened in recent years. In May, the then prime minister, Boris Johnson, announced a \u201cstrategic investment partnership\u201d, which will see Qatar invest in key sectors of the UK economy over the next five years, including fintech, life sciences and cybersecurity. Downing Street said the deal would create new UK jobs and was worth up to \u00a310bn. Days later, the Ministry of Defence announced it would be funding counter-terrorism training for Qatar\u2019s military ahead of the World Cup. Throughout the tournament, the RAF and Royal Navy will provide air and sea support. Last week, foreign secretary James Cleverly was criticised after telling gay football fans they should be respectful in Qatar, which criminalises their sexuality, when attending the World Cup. Speaking on LBC\u2019s Nick Ferrari at Breakfast show, he suggested they show \u201ca little bit of flex and compromise\u201d and be \u201crespectful of the host nation\u201d. Labour called the comments \u201cshockingly tone-deaf\u201d."

                    "body": "It takes only a few minutes to spot the first Lionel Messi shirt after stepping out of Msheireb metro station. Keep going towards Souq Waqif and, although the streets of downtown Doha are not playing host to a typical football atmosphere, images of the little Argentinian genius are hard to miss. There are countless Messi T-shirts hanging from the stalls in the market, there is even a painting of him in the front window of the Souq Waqif Art Center, and judging by the mood among the tourists mooching around the city most people will be backing Argentina when they meet France in the World Cup final on Sunday night.\nAs one stallholder puts it as he sells another Argentina scarf, nobody is particularly interested in his France merchandise. Even the four Brazil fans taking a stroll on a hot Friday morning are wearing curly blue and white wigs. It is a baffling sight, but there is an explanation. Yes, it was annoying that Brazil blew their quarter-final against Croatia. And, yes, Brazilians do hate Argentina. But apparently it\u2019s a bit like hating your family: you love them really and would prefer to see them happy.\nAnd so it begins to feel like destiny; as if nothing can stop Messi from following in the footsteps of Argentina\u2019s other footballing legend, Diego Maradona, and winning the World Cup for the first time. The mood is peaceful. There is no obvious animosity, although a family of four from Kenya reckon it\u2019s too quiet. They have tickets for the final, regularly attend World Cups and remember a livelier atmosphere in Russia four years ago. By now, though, the stage is set. Most people are wearing Argentina shirts. Most people want to see Messi, the greatest player ever, cement his legacy by finding a way past France and leading his country to their third world title.\n\nThis is surely his last chance. Messi, 35, is on a mission. He may be slowing down but his mind is as sharp as ever and he was in inspired form when Argentina beat Croatia on Tuesday. Few would welcome France, defending champions and supreme pragmatists, spoiling the party.\nBut then, out of nowhere, the noise picks up. A man decked out in France colours has appeared in an alleyway full of traders selling Argentina garb, one \u201cFree Palestine\u201d T-shirt and, optimistically, a few Qatar kits. A handful of people spot him and strike up a chant: \u201cMbapp\u00e9! Mbapp\u00e9! Mbapp\u00e9!\u201d\n\nAh yes, him. Kylian Mbapp\u00e9: the freakish French phenomenon who can hit speeds of 37km/h. He is the most thrilling striker in the world, has scored five goals in six games in Qatar and destroyed Argentina in the last 16 four years ago. Can he be stopped? If not, then France, who have broken England\u2019s hearts and ended Morocco\u2019s dream run, are going to hold on to their trophy and Mbapp\u00e9 is going to be the owner of two World Cup winners\u2019 medals at the tender age of 23.\nIt is a reminder that this is the host country\u2019s triumph. Messi and Mbapp\u00e9 are teammates at Paris Saint-Germain, who are owned by Qatar Sports Investments. Nothing could be better for the host country than an Argentina v France final. Other, perhaps, than Messi\u2019s and Mbapp\u00e9\u2019s club-mate Neymar, the Brazil forward, playing a half each for both teams.\n\nThis is Qatar\u2019s crowning glory. What seemed absurd when this tiny but impossibly rich country won hosting rights in 2010 has come to pass. There have been allegations of corruption around the bid over the past 12 years \u2013 all fiercely denied by Qatar. The Lusail Stadium, a luxurious setting for the final, is a glitzy place, but it cannot be forgotten how we got here. The exact number of migrant workers who have died as a result of negligence on projects since 2010 remains unknown.\nHuman rights groups have continued to criticise Qatar. Women face discrimination in law and practice, according to Amnesty International, and the LGBTQ+ community faces persecution. Fifa, meanwhile, began the tournament by stopping captains from seven European countries from wearing the anti-discrimination \u201cOneLove\u201d rainbow armband. There was anger at first; it faded when the football got going, though.\nThe show goes on. Sunday is Qatar National Day. It will be a day of celebrations, of Fifa\u2019s president, Gianni Infantino, beaming proudly from his seat in the VVIP area at the Lusail. It will be Messi v Mbapp\u00e9, proof in Infantino\u2019s mind that this truly has been the best World Cup ever, and the world will be watching as Qatar celebrates its moment of pride."

The list of items banned at the World Cup continues to grow, most recently with reports that England fans have been told not to wear \u201ccrusader\u201d costumes, occasionally favoured by middle-aged white men as misguided-at-best clothing for international matches. Here we take a look at the items banned in Qatar so far. Alcohol Alcohol was banned for fans at the grounds in a last-minute and unprecedented volte-face two days before the tournament started. The sale of alcohol was limited to the Fifa fan festival, other fan destinations and licensed venues. OneLove armbands Fifa in effect banned the wearing of the armbands when it threatened to impose sanctions on any players who did so. A number of players, including the England captain, Harry Kane, had intended to wear the armband as a gesture, in part to highlight Qatar\u2019s appalling human rights record, including but not limited to the treatment of LGBT+ people and the plight of potentially thousands of migrant workers who built the infrastructure for the tournament. Rainbow hats Football Association of Wales staff and Wales supporters have reportedly had rainbow-coloured bucket hats confiscated. Fifa and the Qataris were said to be in talks on the matter on Tuesday, where Fifa reminded the hosts of their assurances before the tournament that everyone was welcome and rainbow flags would be allowed. Among reports were incidents of Welsh FA staff and fans being confronted by security for bringing the hats into the Ahmad bin Ali Stadium and a US fan with a rainbow flag being confronted on the metro. But on Friday, Fifa said fans would be allowed to wear rainbow bucket hats and take rainbow flags into the stadium for Wales\u2019s match against Iran. Bare chests The Fifa stadium code of conduct states that fans must not \u201cremove items of clothing or otherwise remain in a state of undress\u201d \u2013 including being shirtless. And they must not \u201creveal intimate body parts\u201d. Plastic swords The Times reported that England fans had been told not to dress as St George, the patron saint of England, portrayed as a \u201ccrusader knight\u201d with mock chainmail and, often, a plastic sword. The Crusades were a series of bloody religious wars in which Christian invaders, directed by the Latin church attempted to recover Jerusalem and its surrounding area from Islamic rule. Estimates of the death toll vary widely from 1.5 million to as many as 6 million. Fifa said: \u201cCrusader costumes in the Arab context can be offensive against Muslims. That is why anti-discrimination colleagues asked fans to wear things inside out or change dress.\u201d"

In a city constructed on sand, the gentlest of breezes makes it near impossible to prevent the desert from intruding on an otherwise gleaming capital well accustomed to accommodating forces of nature.\nIt is playing host to another one right now, in the shape of a striker capable of making the world\u2019s best defenders feel as helpless as Qatar\u2019s street cleaners.\nAlthough Robert Lewandowski spends most days closeted in the team hotel, he is a ubiquitous presence here. Once darkness falls, and it descends early in the Gulf at this time of year, giant images of the Poland captain and record goalscorer illuminate the sides of skyscrapers lining the city\u2019s Corniche.\n\nUp in the skies above the Arabian Sea countless stacked Qatar Airways flights circle as they queue to land at Hamad airport. Before takeoff passengers may have been slightly surprised to watch Lewandowski starring in a football-themed safety video.\nWhereas his fellow part-time actor, Brazil\u2019s Neymar, is merely seen escorting business-class passengers to their seats, the 34-year-old demonstrates how to pull on a life jacket in the event of an unscheduled landing on water.\nGiven that responsibility and Lewandowski are no strangers, it seems appropriate casting. \u201cPlaying for Poland definitely carries massive pressure,\u201d agrees a striker hoping to guide his country to victory against Mexico in their opening group game on Tuesday. \u201cI\u2019m acutely conscious of the responsibility of meeting our fans\u2019 expectations. They grow with every goal. No matter who we\u2019re playing and what challenges we face, everyone expects me to score \u2013 but it\u2019s not always easy.\u201d\nHe will be shouldering the hopes of, among others, half the clientele of L\u2019Autre, a Polish-Mexican restaurant in London\u2019s Mayfair who know a win would appreciably enhance Czeslaw Michniewicz\u2019s team\u2019s chances of escaping the tournament\u2019s group stage for the first time in 36 years. An evocative photograph of Argentina 1978 hangs proudly on L\u2019Autre\u2019s wall, depicting the scenes when the two countries last met at a World Cup and Poland won 3-1.\n\nConsidering Lewandowski\u2019s age, a repeat could offer him not merely a ticket out of a group also featuring Argentina and Saudi Arabia but an extended last hurrah on the global stage. \u201cI don\u2019t think this will be my last World Cup though,\u201d says a player clearly minded to rage against the dying of the light. \u201cI want to play in the next one too.\u201d\nGiven that \u201cLewangoalski\u201d has scored 18 times in 19 appearance for Barcelona this season and remains feted in Germany \u2013 where he played under J\u00fcrgen Klopp at Borussia Dortmund and Pep Guardiola at Bayern Munich \u2013 it would be unwise to doubt him. Both coaches admired the work ethic of a 6ft 1in forward who did not finish growing until he was 20 and compensated for this late physical development by not only becoming two-footed but expert in the air.\nSuch dedication paid off handsomely, helping him to 76 goals in 134 Poland appearances and a quintet of coronations as Bundesliga player of the year. Lewandowski\u2019s place in the firmament of the world\u2019s greatest centre-forwards is assured thanks to more than 500 career goals, but something significant is missing from an otherwise near-perfect CV.\nDespite that compelling blend of superior movement, stellar technique and sheer power, he is still to score at a World Cup. In mitigation, Poland\u2019s failure to qualify in 2010 and 2014 dictate he has participated in the group stage of only one finals \u2013 Russia 2018.\n\u201cRussia was one of the biggest disappointments of my career, mostly because we didn\u2019t create any opportunities,\u201d he says. \u201cI didn\u2019t have any chances and that still hurts. That was a failure. To score at a World Cup is a huge dream and I\u2019m going to do everything to make this dream happen.\u201d\nFurther inspiration is provided by the famous Poland teams of 1974 and 1982 who recorded third-place World Cup finishes, with Grzegorz Lato winning the Golden Boot at West Germany 1974 after scoring seven goals. \u201cI\u2019ll do well to beat Lato \u2013 we\u2019re not a team that creates a huge number of chances,\u201d acknowledges Lewandowski.\nLato entered politics after retiring from playing, and Lewandowski is widely lauded for his philanthropy and charity work. It is perhaps partly a consequence of Klopp\u2019s influence as an almost surrogate parent \u2013 the striker was only 16 when his father died and he has credited the German with offering him invaluable off-field guidance \u2013 that Lewandowski has such a balanced, mature equilibrium on and off the pitch.\n\n\u201cArgentina will be our toughest match,\u201d says a man who feels Guardiola taught him fresh and invaluable tactical thought. \u201cBut I\u2019ll be very happy to play against [Lionel] Messi. He\u2019s changed football for the better, for ever.\u201d\nAlthough he believes a solid, tactically smart Saudi Arabia should not be underestimated, Mexico represent the immediate challenge. \u201cThey\u2019re a tough team who fight all the way to the final whistle and never give up,\u201d he says. \u201cThey know how to play at major tournaments. They\u2019ll be a big test. \u201cBut we\u2019ll play every match with smiles on our faces and as a unit. Even if it\u2019s very tough I\u2019ll enjoy it.\u201d"

                    "body": "Shortly before Australia unexpectedly beat Denmark in a compelling match, a Qatari official was asked about migrant worker deaths in the lead-up to the World Cup. It was admitted that between 400 and 500 may have died working on infrastructure projects during that period. The actual figure could be far higher and may never be known. Notoriously, the Qatari authorities have not bothered to do the work necessary to come up with an exact number. This Sunday, with a memorable France v Argentina final in prospect, those workers and their families need to be remembered too. Fifa, football\u2019s governing body, continues to ignore calls for a dedicated compensation fund for the migrants killed or injured in Qatar. It should think again. There is still time to make some partial amends for the mistake made in 2010 when \u2013 after a deeply suspect bidding process \u2013 Fifa awarded the World Cup to a super-rich oil state with a poor human rights record and draconian anti-gay laws. During the tournament, Fifa has responded to protests by outlawing displays of defiance such as the wearing of rainbow armbands by players. But suggesting that politics should be kept off the pitch \u2013 as Ars\u00e8ne Wenger, now a Fifa technical director, regrettably chose to do \u2013 makes no sense at all. It was a particularly unprincipled instance of political powerplay (and alleged corruption) which created the sporting problem in the first place. Players such as England\u2019s captain, Harry Kane, threatened with on-field sanctions if he wore the armband, were placed in an invidious position by those who run the game. As the weeks have passed, the football and the compelling narratives it has generated have taken centre stage. So much has been fabulous to watch. At 35, Lionel Messi has scintillated and astounded, dragging an average team to the brink of glory. He stands within touching distance of a World Cup winners\u2019 medal to complete arguably the greatest career in football history. Romantics will be on Messi\u2019s side on Sunday. This was the first edition of the tournament to be held in the Middle East \u2013 in itself a hugely welcome development. It tilted football\u2019s centre of gravity away from Europe and towards the global south in exhilarating fashion. For the first time, all five African sides competing won at least one game. The fans of Ghana, Senegal and Cameroon \u2013 along with their Argentinian and Welsh counterparts \u2013 were stars in their own right, filling stadiums and Doha\u2019s new metro with marvellous colour and noise. And then there was Morocco. The first African and Arab team to reach a World Cup semi-final were both a revelation and a source of continental and cultural pride. The Atlas Lions were passionately backed in cafes and squares from Dakar to Gaza. The sight of the Moroccan winger Sofiane Boufal dancing with his mother on the pitch, after the team\u2019s quarter-final victory against Portugal, moved millions. Sportswashing is only an option because sport \u2013 and particularly football \u2013 can fire the imagination of people and nations through these kind of moments. Association with something so uplifting and unifying, so suggestive of a global community celebrating its diversity, is a good look. By spending a record $220bn, tiny Qatar sought to position itself as the best friend of the world\u2019s favourite game. But it should not have been given the chance. Advocates of engagement will point fairly to labour market reforms introduced as union organisations and NGOs shone a spotlight on the abuse of migrant workers. But those 400-500 admitted deaths will shadow all future reflections on this tournament. It was a great World Cup, but its drama unfolded in the wrong place. To subvert and repurpose Bill Shankly\u2019s famous joke: football is not more important than matters of life and death."

                    "body": "\n\nThe main event\nThe first World Cup in Asia was one for outsiders with both South Korea and Turkey just one game away from the 2002 final. An early start in late May, one that avoided the July rains but also gave star players little time to rest after tough European seasons, was given as a reason for the struggles of some traditional powers. History could repeat itself as the second World Cup in Asia has also been moved due to climatic reasons, albeit quite a bit back rather than a little forward, and while the mid-season action means that the biggest names won\u2019t have played so many games, they will have almost no time to prepare.\nThe Premier League paused last Sunday, exactly a week before the big event kicks off. The other big European competitions had similar schedules and their players will go straight from club into World Cup action.\nThat is not the case for all. Just like 2002, the timing in 2022 could give outsiders a helping hand. In football terms England\u2019s opening Group B opponents Iran look to have a healthy combination with half of the squad in action at a good European level and the other half playing in the Middle East. Their domestic league stopped, 11 games in, on 28 October. Already being based in the region and having more than two weeks extra to prepare could be the difference against England. That is down to Carlos Queiroz, who told the Iranian federation that it was best to finish early. \u201cHe decided to sacrifice match-time for more training,\u201d Shaygan Banisaeid, an Iranian pundit and youth development coach who has worked with a number of clubs in England\u2019s top two tiers, told the Guardian. \u201cThat obviously would not be possible for [Gareth] Southgate, who would have preferred a longer preparation.\u201d\n\nAt least Southgate knows his players are in good hands at their clubs. The Iran manager wants to keep his as close as possible. \u201cQueiroz was concerned about the physical condition of those players that are playing domestically because he doesn\u2019t trust the level of the league, the level of training intensity in their clubs, the poor training facilities and the poor recovery practices in Iran,\u201d added Banisaeid. \u201cThese players are currently training with him, so that he can take care of their physical preparation ahead of the World Cup.\u201d\nQueiroz still wants more, however. \u201cWe face a lack of preparation time at the moment, but I would like to thank all the people who have helped us to have our players in the training,\u201d he said in October. \u201cWe are looking to close the gap between Team Melli and the big teams in the world.\u201d Too much should not be read into the 2-0 defeat, behind closed doors, to Tunisia on Wednesday with 22 players getting some playing time. Bayer Leverkusen striker Sardar Azmoun was not one of them as he recovers from injury. There were rumours, denied by Queiroz, that he had been under pressure to leave the forward, who has spoken out in support of the protests back home in Iran, out of the squad.\nFor a coach with the tactical acumen of the former Real Madrid manager, three weeks with his players could make a difference but compared to some, that\u2019s nothing. Saudi Arabia and Qatar have squads that are entirely domestic-based and while this causes concerns about international exposure and experience, it does give some benefits. The Saudis started their World Cup break on 16 October after just eight games of the season and 32 players headed to nearby Abu Dhabi for a three-week and five-game training camp. Herv\u00e9 Renard has had enough game time to nurse some of his injured players back to fitness and by the time the opener against Argentina comes, Saudi Arabia will have played eight games in two months.\n\nAnd then there is familiarity with the conditions. It goes without saying that Iran, Saudi Arabia and Qatar don\u2019t need to acclimatise. South Korea and Japan play there regularly, with the former having six games in the region in the last 12 months alone and then there are various club and youth competitions that are held on a regular basis in the Middle East. How much difference that makes remains to be seen but every little helps.\n\u201cThis is Iran\u2019s golden generation and probably the best squad of all time,\u201d said Banisaeid. \u201cThere are many familiar names from 2018, who are now more mature, experienced and in the prime of their careers and they are going to give their best to realise the dream of qualifying for the next round. Last time, they were shy by only one point. Iran are not going to be an easy three points for England or the US.\u201d JD\nTalking points\nOffsides Referees\u2019 chief Pierlugi Collina reckons decisions will be quicker and more accurate due to new plans developed by Fifa. The \u201csemi-automatic offside technology\u201d will rule on even the tightest offside decisions more quickly than under the previous system and a 3D animated rendering of the incident will be broadcast for fans in the stadium and on TV. \u201c[It] gives us the possibility to be faster and more accurate,\u201d Collina told reporters on Friday. Twelve cameras in each stadium will track 29 points on the body of each player and a sensor inside the match ball will send data to the VAR operations room 500 times a second, allowing a highly accurate assessment of when the pass was played. Reuters\n\nGreat Danes Kasper Hjulmand believes the wave of emotive support that helped propel his Denmark side to the Euro 2020 semi-finals is still present and hopes to use it in Qatar. Denmark bounced back from the shock of seeing midfielder Christian Eriksen have a cardiac arrest in their opening game to reach the final four of the Euros, willed on by sympathetic support and a determined spirit. \u201cI think definitely it\u2019s still here,\u201d said Hjulmand. \u201cI think we\u2019re in a good position but you cannot just go on emotions and play. I think that the football quality is there and we\u2019re ready.\u201d Reuters\nThe last dance? Poland talisman Robert Lewandowski says he is preparing for the tournament as if it could be his last, but added that he would still be physically fit to play in 2026 \u2013 aged 38 \u2013 if needed. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he told reporters in Doha. \u201cI\u2019m not saying yes, I\u2019m not saying no.\u201d Reuters\nThe mood in Germany\nNormally when the World Cup comes around, Germans proudly fly their country\u2019s flag and enthusiastically back their team. Not this time. Anyone walking around in Berlin this week will struggle to notice any signs of World Cup fervour. There are no flags, no signs, no public viewing events no indication that the football-mad country\u2019s bid for a fifth world title is about to begin with a game against Japan on Tuesday. Qatar\u2019s human rights record and treatment of migrant workers have spoiled the party for many.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want to enjoy a World Cup like this,\u201d said Bernd Beyer of the Boycott Qatar 2022 initiative. \u201cThe fans do not identify with it and are saying they don\u2019t want to have anything to do with it.\u201d There were widespread protests against the tournament during Bundesliga and second division games over the past few weekends, with fans holding banners condemning the human rights situation in Qatar and recent comments by World Cup ambassador Khalid Salman denouncing homosexuality.\n\nThe lack of enthusiasm also has had a commercial impact. Retailers have previously capitalised on the buzz around major tournaments with Germany team-related offers. Former coach Joachim L\u00f6w and his players could be seen everywhere promoting various goods and services. This time, the Association of German Sports Retailers says sales of fan articles are way down compared to previous World Cup years. Associated Press\nBeyond the football\nIn no particular order \u2026\n\u2022 Security guards at World Cup park claim they are paid just 35p an hour.\n\u2022 Fans paid to attend World Cup by Qatar have daily allowance cancelled.\n\u2022 Qatar bans beer from World Cup stadiums after 11th-hour U-turn.\n\u2022 Fan village still a building site 48 hours before tournament kicks off.\n\u2022 Gay Qataris physically abused then recruited as agents, campaigner says.\n\nExperts\u2019 Network\nAs part of a unique collaboration between some of the world\u2019s best media outlets, a series of team guides are bringing a local flavour and expertise to our coverage of this World Cup. You can find them all here, but here\u2019s a taster from Luis Eduardo Inzaurralde\u2019s Uruguay preview:\n\nCan Uruguay really win the World Cup for a third time? Anything is possible and individual performances suggest that most of the squad are in good form and this allows the coach to dream big.\n\nAnd finally \u2026\nThe Central Bank of Ecuador has minted a commemorative coin to mark their participation in Qatar. As a tribute to the national team\u2019s fourth appearance in the World Cup finals, about 1,500 units of the special coin have been made available in the cities of Quito, Guayaquil and Cuenca.\n\n\u201cI wish every success to our beloved Tricolor, made up of players who represent the resilience and spirit of Ecuador,\u201d said Guillermo Avellan from the Central Bank of Ecuador. Each coin is made out of silver, with a retail value of US $63. Reuters"

                    "body": "When the Qatari government decided to spend millions of pounds on a World Cup opening ceremony featuring Morgan Freeman, Jungkook from BTS and hundreds of performers, it probably hoped it would be the moment when the global media finally focused on football rather than human rights. What it probably did not expect was that the BBC would ignore the entire event in favour of a broadcast criticising the treatment of migrant workers, highlighting corruption at Fifa and discussing the ban on homosexuality in Qatar. And that was just in the opening two minutes. \u201cIt\u2019s the most controversial World Cup in history and a ball hasn\u2019t even been kicked,\u201d said the Match of the Day host Gary Lineker as he welcomed viewers to the start of the national broadcaster\u2019s coverage on BBC One. \u201cEver since Fifa chose Qatar back in 2010, the smallest nation to have hosted football\u2019s greatest competition has faced some big questions \u2013 from accusations of corruption in the bidding process to the treatment of migrant workers who built the stadiums where many lost their lives. Homosexuality is illegal here. Women\u2019s rights and freedom of expression are in the spotlight. Also, the decision six years ago to switch the World Cup from summer to winter.\u201d He concluded: \u201cAgainst that backdrop, there\u2019s a tournament to be played \u2013 one that will be watched and enjoyed around the world. Stick to football, say Fifa. Well, we will \u2013 for a couple of minutes at least.\u201d What followed was an evisceration of the political skulduggery and corruption that led to the world\u2019s best footballers gathering in Doha in the middle of the European winter. The BBC declined to explain why it had shunted coverage of the opening ceremony \u2013 traditionally an opportunity for host countries to project soft power around the world \u2013 to an online-only stream. Viewers in other countries saw Jung Kook, one of the most famous singers in the world, perform his new song \u2013 sample inspirational lyric: \u201cLook who we are, we are the dreamers / We\u2019ll make it happen because we believe it\u201d \u2013 in a packed stadium. At the same moment, BBC One viewers were watching the presenter Ros Atkins introduce an interview with Amnesty International and state: \u201cWe\u2019ve never seen a World Cup with a carbon footprint like this before.\u201d Even the former footballers brought in to analyse the actual sport for the BBC broke down any pretence that politics should be kept out of football. The former England international Alex Scott mocked Fifa\u2019s chief, Gianni Infantino, for suggesting he could feel solidarity with migrant workers and the expense of attending the World Cup. \u201cYou will never know what it is like to be a migrant worker. To keep saying football is for everyone \u2013 it\u2019s not. You can\u2019t say football is for everyone,\u201d Scott said. The former England captain Alan Shearer went further. \u201cIf he feels that strong about the migrant workers and their families, Amnesty has been asking Fifa for just over $400m in a compensation fund. They haven\u2019t agreed to that. Why?\u201d Shearer asked. Rather than Doha\u2019s preferred narrative of a tiny Arab country uniting the world with football, viewers in the UK were left in no doubt that the World Cup was mired in accusations of bribery and that Qatar was a deeply flawed host country. There was, of course, an alternative to the BBC\u2019s coverage. Viewers watching in the UK on Freeview could have watched the buildup on Al Jazeera, the English-language rolling news channel funded by the Qatari government. There there was acknowledgement of the criticisms but the event was presented in the context of \u201cincredible advances in infrastructure\u201d in Doha. While the BBC highlighted again and again the deaths of migrant workers, Al Jazeera showed construction staff meeting the England team, as a voiceover intoned: \u201cHad it not been for the beautiful game, these two groups of men, with their different languages and backgrounds, might never have met. But football has brought them together.\u201d Back on the BBC, there was no such niceties, although Lineker did push Shearer to address the parallels with his boyhood club Newcastle United riding high thanks to enormous Saudi Arabian investment. \u201cWe as fans don\u2019t get to choose where the World Cup is, just like we don\u2019t get to choose who invests in our football clubs,\u201d replied Shearer, highlighting some of the nuance associated with being a fan in an era of sportswashing campaigns. And then, after half an hour, the programme rapidly shifted towards discussion of football \u2013 the tactics, the egos, the lineups, the optimism, the potential winners, the likely losers, the adverts for alcohol sponsors who cannot sell alcohol, the likelihood of Qatar or Ecuador, playing the opening match, making it out of the group stage \u2013 and, eventually, 22 people kicking a ball around a pitch. But BBC viewers had just seen something unusual: a television broadcaster with the rights to show the world\u2019s biggest sporting event choosing to comprehensively trash the product it was about to serve up."

                    "body": "\u201cI can play a lot of different styles,\u201d said Morocco\u2019s coach, Walid Regragui, this month. \u201cI admire Guardiola, Simeone and Ancelotti, but I also have my own style which allows me to adapt the team according to the qualities of the players available.\u201d Regragui, a former defender born in France to parents from Fnideq in northern Morocco, spent three years playing in Spain and won 45 caps for Morocco but never appeared at a World Cup finals. Yet his appointment to replace the Bosnian Vahid Halilhodzic at the end of August represented a significant moment in the history of African football. His presence on the touchline in Qatar, along with that of his fellow former professionals Aliou Ciss\u00e9 of Senegal, Cameroon\u2019s Rigobert Song and Ghana\u2019s Otto Addo, and Tunisia\u2019s ultra-experienced career coach Jalel Kadri, means that for the first time all of the continent\u2019s representatives at the World Cup will have an African manager in the dugout. Fittingly, each is homegrown.  The 47-year-old Regragui deserves his opportunity having guided Wydad Casablanca to a surprise victory in the CAF Champions League final over the reigning champions Al Ahly in May after six successful years at FUS Rabat and having won the Qatari title with Al-Duhail in 2020. Regragui\u2019s Champions League triumph saw him dubbed the \u201cMoroccan Guardiola\u201d by a Tunisian commentator but there is no doubting the former assistant to Rachid Taoussi is his own man after he recalled Chelsea\u2019s Hakim Ziyech from the international wilderness. Whether he can follow in the footsteps of Nigeria\u2019s Stephen Keshi, who became the first homegrown coach to lead an African side to the knockout stages in 2014, remains to be seen given their task in a difficult group containing Belgium, Croatia and Canada. Morocco will hope for a repeat of their breakthrough success under the Brazilian Jos\u00e9 Faria at the 1986 World Cup when they topped a group that included England before being eliminated in the last 16 by West Germany. Until 2014, only 10 of 38 African teams at the World Cup were led by homegrown coaches, with the three sides who reached the quarter-finals \u2013 Cameroon in 1990, Senegal in 2002 and Ghana in 2010 \u2013 managed by Europeans. The straight-talking Ciss\u00e9, captain of Bruno Metsu\u2019s team that shocked the reigning champions and Senegal\u2019s former colonial masters France in the opening match in 2002, was one of two African home-grown coaches at the last World Cup in Russia and suffered the agony of seeing his team eliminated because of an inferior disciplinary record. Level on all other criteria with Japan, they went out.  Since then the Teranga Lions have developed a more ruthless streak and were crowned African champions for the first time in February, even if their chances of making a real impression in this tournament have been hit by Sadio Man\u00e9\u2019s absence through injury. \u201cI represent a new generation that would like to have its place in African and world football,\u201d said Ciss\u00e9, a former Birmingham and Portsmouth midfielder, four years ago. \u201cWe need African coaches for our football to go ahead.\u201d Ciss\u00e9 has been in charge of Senegal since 2015 but has worked with many of the same players for almost a decade after starting as an assistant to the Under-23s. Song, who won 137 caps and played at four World Cups, also has some experience at the helm having served as Cameroon\u2019s caretaker manager for an extended period in 2017 before returning in February after the Africa Cup of Nations. The 46-year-old\u2019s presence in Qatar is all the more remarkable given that six years ago he suffered a cerebral attack and was in a coma for two days. Emulating his 1994 mentor L\u00e9onard Ns\u00e9k\u00e9 and becoming the second Cameroonian to qualify for the World Cup as a coach was a huge endorsement of his credentials.  For Addo the opportunity to manage Ghana after their group-stage exit at Afcon under Milovan Rajevac, their coaching hero of 2010, came as something of a surprise. Born in Germany, he played for Borussia Dortmund at the time he won most of his 15 Ghana caps and the 47-year-old\u2019s day job is still as talent coach for the club\u2019s rising stars \u2013 a role that has included working closely with England\u2019s Jude Bellingham. Having stepped up from being Rajevac\u2019s assistant, Addo masterminded a famous victory over Nigeria to qualify and has his sights on a revenge mission against Luis Su\u00e1rez\u2019s Uruguay in Group H. Su\u00e1rez\u2019s goalline handball in 2010 denied Ghana likely passage to the semi-finals. Of all the African managers heading to Qatar, Tunisia\u2019s Kadri has the most experience. The 50-year-old began his coaching career in 2002 and spent time as assistant to Nabil Ma\u00e2loul with the national team in 2013 before returning to the role under Mondher Kebaier last year. Kadri was promoted when Kebaier contracted Covid during Afcon and landed the job permanently after their victory over Nigeria.  Tunisia became the first African team to win a match at the World Cup in 1978, under their homegrown coach Abdelmajid Chetali, but have never reached the knockout stages and may find it tough to progress from a group with France, Denmark and Australia. All five of Africa\u2019s representatives failed to qualify from the group stages in Russia \u2013 the first time since 1982 that none had made it through. But as the Confederation of African Football said this month, the presence of five African coaches in Qatar \u201crepresents a giant step towards the development of African football\u201d."

The singer, 48, has been criticised on social media for agreeing to sing during the tournament, which begins on Sunday night, due to the country\u2019s human rights record, stance on homosexuality and treatment of migrant workers. Other musicians including Dua Lipa and Rod Stewart have recently stated that they will not perform there. But in an excerpt from Williams\u2019s interview with Italian newspaper Il Venerd\u00ec di Repubblica, scheduled to be published next month, the former Take That member said: \u201cOf course, I don\u2019t condone any abuses of human rights anywhere. \u201cBut, that being said, if we\u2019re not condoning human rights abuses anywhere, then it would be the shortest tour the world has ever known: I wouldn\u2019t even be able to perform in my own kitchen.\u201d He added: \u201cAnybody leaving messages saying \u2018no to Qatar\u2019 are doing so on Chinese technology. It would be hypocritical of me to not go [to Qatar] because of the places that I do go to.\u201d Williams is scheduled to perform at Doha Golf Club in Qatar on 8 December. He said: \u201cYou get this microscope that goes \u2018OK, these are the baddies, and we need to rally against them\u2019. I think that the hypocrisy there is that if we take that case in this place, we need to apply that unilaterally to the world. \u201cThen if we apply that unilaterally to the world, nobody can go anywhere.\u201d The singer added: \u201cWhat we\u2019re saying is: \u2018You behave like us, or we will annex you from society. Behave like us, because we\u2019ve got it right.\u2019\u201d Amnesty International has called on Williams to use his concert to publicly address the accusations against Qatar. Last weekend, Rod Stewart said he refused a substantial offer to perform in the country. He told the Sunday Times: \u201cI was actually offered a lot of money, over $1m, to play there [Qatar] 15 months ago. I turned it down. It\u2019s not right to go.\u201d Last week, Dua Lipa denied reports that she will perform at the opening ceremony of the World Cup. The singer wrote on social media that she will \u201clook forward to visiting Qatar when it has fulfilled all the human rights pledges it made\u201d when it became the tournament\u2019s host."

                    "body": "The Welsh first minister has been criticised for staying in a five-star hotel paid for by the Qatar government during his trip to the football World Cup. Mark Drakeford and the Welsh economy minister, Vaughan Gething, stayed at the Ritz-Carlton as guests of the host nation. The Liberal Democrats claimed accepting the hospitality may have undermined the Labour-led government\u2019s commitment towards human rights and called on it to donate the equivalent cost of the stays to charity. Amnesty International expressed concern that politicians who enjoyed lavish hospitality could feel compromised when it came to raising human rights issues. At the time of the trip, Drakeford defended his decision to travel to Qatar, arguing that citizens of Wales would have wanted him to be there and insisting it gave him a chance to raise concerns about human rights issues. On Wednesday, the Welsh government confirmed that the Qatar government had paid for hotels for Drakeford, Gething and a number of officials. It said it was part of a hospitality package offered to all delegates and travelling parties and had no influence on the approach taken by Welsh ministers to raise serious concerns with Qatari officials. A Welsh government spokesperson said: \u201cThe first minister and the economy minister visited Qatar to support the Welsh men\u2019s football team as they took part in their first World Cup in 64 years. \u201cThis was an opportunity to discuss trade and investment opportunities, meet with members of the Qatar government and the International Labour Organization to discuss worker rights, and to take part in cultural meetings to strengthen the links between the Qatar and Wales. \u201cThe visit also was a chance to share our values on human rights, LGBTQ+ rights, workers\u2019 rights and political and religious freedom.\u201d The Welsh Liberal Democrat leader, Jane Dodds, said: \u201cBy accepting this gift, Mark Drakeford has potentially undermined the Welsh government\u2019s commitment towards human rights, LGBTQ+ rights and women\u2019s rights. \u201cThe Welsh Liberal Democrats will continue to call on Mark Drakeford and Welsh Labour to donate the equivalent cost of the trip to human rights charities who address the problems faced in Qatar.\u201d Plaid Cymru\u2019s sport and international affairs spokesperson, Heledd Fychan, said: \u201cAccepting hospitality risks undermining the commitment made by the Welsh government that they condemn the record of the Qatar government on workers safety and LGBTQ+ rights. \u201cIt\u2019s now essential that when the Senedd next meets, the first minister explains how he and the minister for the economy raised these important issues.\u201d Felix Jakens, Amnesty International UK\u2019s head of priority campaigns and individuals at risk, said: \u201cIt would be a cause of real concern if politicians were accepting lavish hospitality \u2013 at the World Cup or anywhere else \u2013 from foreign governments and then feeling compromised when it came to raising human rights issues. \u201cWe repeatedly called on politicians and others with influence who attended the World Cup in Qatar to raise human rights issues with their hosts and with Fifa, and we would hope that Mark Drakeford and Vaughan Gething can show that they sought to do this.\u201d  "

                    "body": "International television crews in Qatar for the Fifa World Cup could be banned from interviewing people in their own homes as part of sweeping reporting restrictions that could have a \u201csevere chilling effect\u201d on media coverage. Broadcasters, such as the BBC and ITV, will effectively be barred from filming at accommodation sites, such as those housing migrant workers, under the terms of filming permits issued by the Qatari government. According to the terms, recording at government buildings, universities, places of worship and hospitals is also prohibited, along with filming at residential properties and private businesses. The restrictions are within a list of conditions that outlets must agree to when applying for a filming permit from the Qatari authorities to \u201ccapture photography and videography of the most popular locations around the country\u201d. They also apply to photographers but do not explicitly refer to print journalists who do not film their interviews. The rules do not prohibit reports on specific subjects, but restricting where crews can film \u2013 \u201cincluding but not limited to houses, apartment complexes, accommodation sites\u201d \u2013 is likely to make it difficult for them to investigate reported abuses, such as the mistreatment of migrant workers, or to conduct interviews on subjects people may be reluctant to discuss in public, such as LGBTQ+ rights. Last night, Qatar\u2019s supreme committee denied imposing \u201cchilling\u201d restrictions on media freedoms and said \u201cseveral regional and international media outlets are based in Qatar, and thousands of journalists report from Qatar freely without interference each year.\u201d It said it had updated an earlier version of its film permit application terms that appeared on its website to relax the rules for broadcasters attending the World Cup, including removing a rule that said they must \u2018\u2019acknowledge and agree\u201d they will not produce reports that may be \u201cinappropriate or offensive to the Qatari culture, Islamic principles\u201d. But while the newer rules say filming is allowed across the state of Qatar, they still appear to impose strict restrictions, including that by applying for a permit, broadcasters agree \u201cnot to capture film/photography at excluded locations\u201d. Places where filming is not allowed under the permit are \u201cresidential properties, private businesses and industrial zones\u201d or government, educational, health and religious buildings. The rules also say that broadcasters must \u201crespect the privacy of individuals\u201d and not film them or their properties without their \u201cexpress prior approval\u201d. Fifa said it was \u201cworking with the supreme committee and relevant organisations in Qatar to ensure the best possible working conditions for media attending the tournament, as well as ensuring that broadcasters continue to report freely without any restrictions\u201d.  A spokesman said it would be \u201cimportant to clarify that filming on private property in any country remains subject to approval of the owner/operator of the property\u201d. He did not comment on why the terms include an outright ban on filming on private property. Journalists have previously been detained in Qatar for reporting on issues deemed contentious by the authorities. In 2015, a group of BBC reporters was arrested in Doha and spent two nights in prison while investigating housing conditions for migrant workers. Last November, two Norwegian journalists investigating conditions for migrant labourers working on World Cup venues were arrested and detained for 36 hours as they tried to leave the country. James Lynch, from FairSquare, a London-based human rights group, said the rules were an \u201cextraordinarily sweeping range of restrictions\u201d that would make it difficult for TV crews to pursue non-football related stories. He said: \u201cIt would be incredibly difficult to fully comply with these terms, if even filming near to private or government property violates the terms of a permit. \u201cThis is likely to have a severe chilling effect on free expression. How many organisations will authorise reporting on Qatar\u2019s social issues if to do so puts them at risk of ending up in court?\u201d The restrictions present an ethical dilemma for broadcasters. The BBC and ITV\u2019s stringent editorial guidelines promote impartiality and are designed to protect against undue influence, including from governments. BBC guidelines, which apply to all content, say broadcasts should not unnecessarily offend but stress the importance of free expression. Jemimah Steinfeld, editor-in-chief at Index on Censorship, said the film permit conditions were a \u201cdefinite cause for concern\u201d and appeared to be \u201cpurposely ambiguous\u201d so that broadcasters would \u201cerr on the side of caution\u201d. She said her gut feeling was she felt they should not agree to such terms but said it was \u201cextremely difficult terrain\u201d to navigate. \u201cThe question is whether there might be stories that they can still do within the realms of that agreement, and is it more important that they do those stories?\u201d she said. \u201cIf the BBC is basically being shoved into a position where all they can cover is the glory of it, then that would be a bad outcome.\u201d Qatar is an Islamic country with an authoritarian system of government. Swearing, public displays of affection and dressing immodestly are seen as offensive. Homosexual behaviour is illegal. Posting material that appears to insult, slander or is culturally insensitive may also be considered a crime, according to travel advice from the UK government. In recent months, Qatar appears to have softened its stance on several issues in an attempt to convince visitors that it is safe and tolerant. It is allowing the sale of alcohol at stadiums, for instance, and has said that gay fans will be able to display affection during the World Cup. It has not eased rules restricting freedom of speech, which include a law against spreading \u201cfake news\u201d online.  The BBC did not say if it had agreed to or challenged the film permit rules. A spokeswoman said it had a \u201cproven record of addressing topical issues as part of our coverage. This World Cup will be no different.\u201d ITV said its news and current affairs team had carried out \u201cextensive reporting of the decision to award the tournament to Qatar and the questions surrounding the host nation\u2019s human rights record and will continue to do so\u201d. \u201cOur journalism will be robustly independent. ITV\u2019s World Cup tournament coverage will focus on the football, but will not shy away from the controversies off the pitch,\u201d a spokesman said \u2022 This article was amended on 15 October 2022 to include a response from the Qatari authorities received after publication. An earlier version reported on the terms of the filming permit published on the Fifa World Cup Qatar 2022 website, including that it said media must agree not to produce reports that may be \u201cinappropriate or offensive to the Qatari culture, Islamic principles\u201d. However, the supreme committee told the Observer this document related to the draw stage and had since been revised. The article was amended to reflect this, and to remove reference to the geographical locations covered by the permit as originally seen. That filming permit was deleted from the tournament website shortly after this article was published. "

                    "body": "Next stop: the 2036 Olympics. Qatar believes the World Cup has gone so well that it can be a springboard to hosting the biggest sporting event of all. The Guardian understands the country is ready to flex its muscles again and bid to stage the Games in the autumn of 2036, despite having failed three times in the past.\nThose earlier bids fell short due in part to scepticism from within the International Olympic Committee that such a small country had the infrastructure to stage an event that attracts 10,500 athletes across 32 sports, along with millions of spectators. However there is growing optimism in Doha that this World Cup offers proof to the IOC that Qatar can deliver an Olympics-style concept, with multiple venues in one major city.\nAt this stage it is understood Qatar wants to go it alone. But it is likely that there will be people in Olympic circles who will put pressure on Qatar\u2019s Olympic Committee to have a joint Middle East bid with Saudi Arabia. It was also perhaps notable that Qatar\u2019s emir, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani, who has been a member of the IOC since 2002, has posed with a Saudi flag at this World Cup.\n\nGiven the high temperatures in Qatar during the summer, the event would have to be shifted to the autumn. However it would not be the first time that has happened: the 1964 Olympics in Tokyo began on 10 October, while both Seoul 1988 and Sydney 2000 started in mid September.\nQatar would look to extend its use of air-conditioned stadiums, which have proved so successful at this World Cup, to the courses of other outdoor venues. Such a scenario would enable it to avoid the harrowing scenes that marred the women\u2019s marathon at the 2019 World Athletics Championships, when nearly half the field dropped out due to the high heat and humidity despite the race starting on the Corniche just before midnight.\nDespite Qatar\u2019s optimism, any bid would inevitably face multiple challenges. The Olympic community has far more out LGBTQ+ athletes than football, and they are likely to express far deeper reservations at the prospect of the Games being staged in a country where being gay is criminalised.\n\nThe IOC would also not countenance any of its sponsors having its products removed just days before the Games began, as Budweiser faced here after the Qataris imposed an alcohol ban on spectators at stadiums. The IOC president, Thomas Bach, is also thought to be cool on any Qatar bid. However, he is due to step down in 2025, a year before the decision on where to stage the 2036 Games is likely to be made.\nThere will be logistical challenges too, including how to host a mountain bike competition in a country where the highest point is 338 feet above sea level. However, Qatar will argue that much of the accommodation, transport and stadia is also already in place to stage a future Games, although a new Olympic stadium would have to be built given that the Khalifa International Stadium, which staged the World Athletics Championships in 2019, has a capacity of just over 45,000.\nOther countries expected to bid for the 2036 Games include India, Indonesia and Turkey."

I don\u2019t have the precise number, that is something that is being discussed.\n\n\u201cOne death is too many, it\u2019s as simple as that. [But] every year the health and safety standards on the sites are improving, at least on our sites, the World Cup sites, the ones we are responsible for. Most definitely to the extent that you have trade unions [commending] the work that has been done on World Cup sites and the improvement.\u201d\nAfter the interview there was anger at Thawadi\u2019s comments with Nicholas McGeehan of the advocacy group Fair Square saying: \u201cThis is just the latest example of Qatar\u2019s inexcusable lack of transparency on the issues of workers\u2019 deaths. We need proper data and thorough investigations, not vague figures announced through media interviews. Fifa and Qatar still have a lot of questions to answer, not least where, when, and how did these men die and did their families receive compensation.\u201d\nThe Supreme Committee has always maintained there have been only three work-related fatalities and 37 non-work-related deaths among migrant workers at World Cup stadiums since construction for the tournament began in 2014.\nOn Tuesday an SC spokesperson said: \u201cThis is documented on an annual basis in the SC\u2019s public reporting and covers the eight stadiums, 17 non-competition venues and other related sites under the SC\u2019s scope. Separate quotes regarding figures refer to national statistics covering the period of 2014-2020 for all work-related fatalities (414) nationwide in Qatar, covering all sectors and nationalities.\u201d\n\nIn 2021 the Guardian published research that showed that more than 6,500 migrant workers from five countries \u2013 India, Pakistan, Nepal, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka \u2013 had died in Qatar between the start of 2011, the year after country won the right to host the World Cup, and 2020.\nWhile the Guardian\u2019s figures showed the total number of deaths from all causes and in all locations, activists have always argued that the World Cup caused an increase in the number of migrant workers travelling to the country. At the time McGeehan said: \u201cA very significant proportion of the migrant workers who have died since 2011 were only in the country because Qatar won the right to host the World Cup.\u201d\nThe Qatari government did not dispute the Guardian\u2019s figures, but said that \u201cthe mortality rate among these communities is within the expected range for the size and demographics of the population\u201d. The official figure of three stadium work-related World Cup deaths was repeated by Fifa and used in a speech by its president, Gianni Infantino, in an address to the European Council this year.\nSteve Cockburn, Amnesty International\u2019s head of economic and social justice, said: \u201cThe continued debate around the number of workers who have died in the preparation of the World Cup exposes the stark reality that so many bereaved families are still waiting for truth and justice. Over the last decade, thousands of workers have returned home in coffins, with no explanation given to their loved ones.\u201d"

It was also a third World Cup victory for Argentina, who beat France on penalties at the end of a wildly oscillating 3-3 draw.\nMore tellingly, it was also a kind of coronation, belatedly, for the greatest footballer of the age, probably of any age, the mooching 35-year-old mobile brain Lionel Messi, a thousand games into his astonishing career.\n\nThis was an emotional overload, a game that seemed to have been won at least four times over 120 minutes before it finally was with the last kick of the tournament. Even here there was a twist. This World Cup final was supposed come down to a meeting of genius, to the Messi-Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 dynastic arm wrestle. It did in many ways. Mbapp\u00e9 scored the first hat-trick in a men\u2019s World Cup final since Geoff Hurst in 1966 and still lost.\nBut the game also came down at the death to good old-fashioned malandro gamesmanship, embodied by the chest-puffing antics of Argentina\u2019s goalkeeper Emiliano Mart\u00ednez, who chucked the ball away, advanced on the French kickers, almost screwed himself into the ground after each unsuccessful kick, and at one point had to be shoved back by the referee.\n\nAs Gonzalo Montiel\u2019s winning kick billowed the net, a beautifully soft moment before the night dissolved into a wave of static, Messi was buried in the centre circle under a knot of blue and white.\nEventually he broke free and walked off, waving both hands, all alone in the chaos apart from a single passing cameraman sensing his own money shot. How fitting, in the end, that Messi should celebrate a World Cup the same way he won it, by walking around on his own.\n\nThis was a Messi story in so many ways. Messi scored seven goals at Qatar 2022 and won the Golden Ball as the best player. He toyed with some of the greatest footballers on earth. He did all this aged 35 and semi-injured. This is not normal. At some stage it will start to stretch the bounds of credibility.\nPlus he is part of the wider story of this $7bn sporting extravaganza. As Messi was given the World Cup trophy he was handed a robe to wear by the emir of Qatar, who is also his employer.\nYou get what you pay for, and Qatar achieved its perfect final here. You have to admire the thoroughness, a blueprint that says we will not only pay for the World Cup but for the players who are most likely to be on the podium at the end: a Messi, an Mbapp\u00e9, paid ambassadors of Qatar Sports Investments via dizzying contracts with Paris Saint-Germain. This is the real thing: end-to-end fully encrypted sportswashing. It is an incredible feat of will.\n\nBut there is also a paradox in Messi winning this divisive and physically brutal of World Cups. There have always been two World Cups at Qatar 2022. First, the one Qatar built out of human wastage, the one that has held a mirror up not only to the depravity of big sport, but to a global labour market that drives migrant workers into lucrative near-captivity; a system Qatar did not create, which it has simply embodied with manic hypercompetence.\n\nThen there is the other World Cup, the spectacle that brings joy and drama, and that feeling of collectivism; and which Messi\u2019s brilliance has elevated into one of the great sporting stories.\nHe was sublime all game. From the start the colours were perfect. The deep French blue, the Albiceleste of Argentina, the lime-green grass, the cold white stadium lights. The opening five minutes of any Messi performance have been much discussed in recent weeks. Messi spends those five minutes watching.\nHe did it here. He scans, does a panorama, walks, scouts his opponents. And Messi\u2019s walking is not really walking. It\u2019s thinking. Walking is his rapid eye movement, his spinning disc while he crunches the code. Messi walks three miles a game. He is not doing this to get his steps up.\nAnd from the start Argentina were more fluid than at any stage to this point, \u00c1ngel Di Mar\u00eda providing another point of incision on the left. It felt a little strange. Messi was almost too involved. This is supposed to be the World Cup of moments. Don\u2019t waste it. Keep it safe. Wait for it to bloom.\n\nMessi duly scored the opening goal from the spot, made by Di Mar\u00eda. The second for Argentina was a wonderful team goal. Messi had a hand at the start, producing a sublime 45-degree pass. Di Mar\u00eda finished expertly, then just kind of collapsed, drunk on the glory, the noise the space, the light.\nDidier Deschamps ripped up his attack. France sat on the game for a bit. And so the twists began. Mbapp\u00e9 made it 2-1 on 80 minutes, then 2-2 with a beautifully pure finish. In the VVIP boxes Emmanuel Macron \u201cwent off on one\u201d, the gravely intellectual president of the republic hooting, leaping and honking like a startled goose.\nArgentina had gone. The team that seemed to be romping like handsome schoolboys towards glory looked frazzled, lost, done. Then Argentina came back, scoring again through Messi, before Mbapp\u00e9 levelled it again from the spot. Then came penalties and that final moment of grace.\n\u2022 This article was amended on 19 December 2022. Lionel Messi scored seven goals at the tournament, not six as an earlier version said."

                    "body": "Gareth Southgate is facing criticism from human rights groups after claiming that workers in Qatar were \u201cunited\u201d in wanting the World Cup to take place, despite the country\u2019s poor employment rights record.\nThe England manager\u2019s remarks were questioned by Human Rights Watch, which said families of migrant workers who had died, been injured, or cheated of their wages had told it they \u201cwould like to support the World Cup but cannot because their children are starving and their breadwinners died in Qatar\u201d.\n\nAmnesty International warned that although many migrant workers in Qatar were football fans, the majority were more interested in having their rights fully protected and being paid properly than in the World Cup.\nSouthgate made his remarks in an interview with CNN, in which he acknowledged there were ongoing issues with Qatar but said there was no question the World Cup should go ahead. \n\u201cI\u2019ve been out to Qatar several times and I\u2019ve met lots of the workers out there and they are united in certainly one thing, that\u2019s that they want the tournament to happen, and they want that because they love football,\u201d he said. \u201cThey want the football to come to Qatar.\u201d\nHowever Minky Worden, the director of global initiatives at Human Rights Watch, suggested such a viewpoint was misplaced. \n\u201cFirst, migrant workers in Qatar cannot speak freely because of security concerns, and the FA should know this,\u201d she told the Guardian. \n\u201cSecond, has Gareth Southgate and the FA attempted to contact migrant workers and families of those who died from Nepal, India, Kenya or elsewhere? Any family who received a loved one and breadwinner home in a coffin without compensation from Fifa and Qatar cannot cheer the opening of this World Cup.\n\u201cSouthgate does not face any risks speaking to migrant workers, but migrant workers do face risks in speaking to him, including the loss of their jobs and deportation if they say something Qatari officials think is wrong. \nThere are many migrant workers who are proud of the work they have done to build the World Cup in Qatar. But there are also many who have suffered preventable deaths and harms and until the deaths, loans, injuries and wage theft are compensated, it is not correct to say all migrant workers are \u2018united\u2019.\u201d\n\nThe issue of human rights in Qatar remains a concern, despite Fifa and the Qatari organisers claiming that significant reforms have taken place. Last year the Guardian reported that 6,500 migrant workers had died since Qatar was awarded the World Cup 10 years ago. A more recent investigation found that workers employed on World Cup-related projects are having to work 12-hour shifts across 30 days a month to earn the equivalent of about \u00a31 an hour.\nIn his interview Southgate stressed that the Football Association had been working with human rights groups to help them to seek redress before the tournament kicks off on 20 November. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to support those ideas with compensation for families who have lost workers and a worker\u2019s rights centre,\u201d he said. \u201cSo we\u2019re supporting the things we\u2019ve been asked to support.\u201d\nHowever Ella Knight, Amnesty International\u2019s migrants\u2019 labour rights researcher, said far more needed to be done by Fifa and football as a whole. \n\u201cMany workers in Qatar will of course be football fans, but what migrant workers have really stressed to us is the need to have their rights fully protected, to be paid properly, able to change jobs freely and to enjoy safe and dignified working conditions \u2013 before, during and after this tournament,\u201d she said. \n\u201cThe World Cup is about to take place with vital labour reforms still very much unfinished business, and thousands of workers\u2019 abuses remaining unaddressed.\n\u201cThe opening game is now less than three weeks away and Fifa is yet to commit to remedying workers and their families for the abuses they\u2019ve suffered despite widespread support from the public, FAs, players and World Cup sponsors. We urge the FA to maintain its pressure on Fifa, pushing it to recognise and urgently address the suffering of workers without whom the World Cup simply wouldn\u2019t be possible.\u201d\nThe Qatari Supreme Committee, which is responsible for organising the tournament, has insisted there have been improvements. In a statement last month it said: \u201cThe advancements in workers\u2019 welfare is a legacy we are very proud of, and one that we are already seeing in action. We have always believed that the World Cup will be a catalyst to accelerate positive initiatives, leaving a legacy of meaningful and sustainable progress for the country and region.\u201d"

                    "body": "On a huge billboard in front of Kathmandu\u2019s international airport, is a picture of five migrant workers with the words: \u201cMeet the hardest working team in Qatar. Wouldn\u2019t it be great if they were compensated for it?\u201d Just metres away, hundreds of young men board flights to Qatar and other Gulf states every day, hoping to earn enough to look after the families they leave behind. About 400,000 Nepalis work in Qatar and many toiled for years on its preparations for the World Cup. For some the deal has worked out. They earned a regular if low wage, which meant they could afford to send their children to better schools, buy land or rebuild their house. For others, the World Cup has left a bitter legacy. Millions celebrated Argentina\u2019s victory at the Lusail stadium on Sunday, but not Thagendra Adhikari. \u201cThe stadium is very beautiful. It\u2019s well designed. But I have a lot of bad memories from there,\u201d says Adhikari, who spent more than two years helping to construct the 80,000-seat arena. \u201cWhenever I see that stadium on the screen, I feel bad. I was abused and exploited there. I, and many workers, received unfair wages. I love football, but I still can\u2019t forget my dark days in Qatar.\u201d Adhikari says he was forced to pay 115,000 rupees (\u00a3715) to a recruitment agent in Nepal to secure his job, which left him mired in debt. He says the agent promised a salary of 1,200 rials (\u00a3270) a month but he was only paid 750 rials (\u00a3170), forcing him to put in countless hours of overtime to make up the difference. \u201cI like football, I\u2019m a big Lionel Messi fan, but this World Cup hasn\u2019t touched my heart because thousands of workers like me in Qatar were not treated well,\u201d says Adhikari. \u201cWe workers have shed blood, sweat and tears to make the World Cup happen, but we weren\u2019t paid properly for it.\u201d  Naresh Shrestha, a construction manager who also worked on Lusail stadium, has a very different view. \u201cI am proud that I was part of the construction of that iconic stadium. The Nepali team [of workers] did very well,\u201d he says. \u201cThe World Cup has very much improved working conditions in Qatar. Some rules were changed to benefit workers. It\u2019s very good now.\u201d But there is often a huge gap between the experience of skilled professionals like Shrestha, and low-wage workers like Bipin Magar*. When Magar set out for Qatar in 2021, he expected to be there for at least two years. Already in debt in Nepal, he says he took out more loans to pay a recruitment agent about 135,000 rupees (\u00a3840) for the job in Qatar. He spent eight months working on Stadium 974, the temporary arena that won praise for its innovative design, before he was suddenly sent home. Thousands of other low-wage workers, like Magar, were sent back against their wishes, and often still in debt, as companies were ordered to wrap up construction projects before the start of the World Cup.  Magar is caught in a spiral of debt, and has now returned to Qatar \u2013 once again paying his own way \u2013 in a desperate attempt to repay what he owes. He has bad recollections of his time working on the stadium. He says whenever the local World Cup organising committee came for inspections his employer would tell them not to say anything negative. Only the workers who were not likely to raise problems were put in front of the inspectors. However, now back in Qatar, he is working on other constructions projects under far worse conditions. \u201cWe\u2019ve had to work in extreme temperatures, but we didn\u2019t have easy access to water. At first, I didn\u2019t even have a bed or pillow. We would sleep on the floor. Workers like me have it tough,\u201d says Magar. Despite playing a part in constructing the stadiums, Magar found no joy in watching the matches. \u201cMy friends enjoyed the games, but I couldn\u2019t. When you go through financial problems, it\u2019s very difficult to be find happiness in this type of thing. I have my own problems to focus on,\u201d he says. \u201cNothing works out as you expect here.\u201d * Name has been changed to protect his identity"

I believe, as a pragmatist, you have to acknowledge work as it goes. Progress doesn\u2019t move in a straight line. We\u2019ve got to acknowledge what\u2019s been done, we\u2019ve got to acknowledge what\u2019s to do.\n\u201cWe had a constructive, frank discussion about that, about what\u2019s to come and Australia\u2019s role in that.\n\u201cWe could all do more to advance human rights and this global scrutiny will turn itself upon us July next year when Australia [and New Zealand] hosts the Women\u2019s World Cup.\u201d\nWells\u2019s comments came after Socceroos midfielder, Jackson Irvine, expressed sympathy for European World Cup players threatened with sanctions for wearing the OneLove rainbow armbands but also questioned the messaging behind them."

                    "body": "If this World Cup finally has a pulse, it was first detected on Doha\u2019s Corniche shortly after 6pm on Saturday, as an adrenalised version of Seven Nation Army segued into a We Are the Champions cover with enough distorted bass to make ear drums bleed.\nAt that moment hundreds of fans at Fifa\u2019s fan festival \u2013 particularly from Mexico, Argentina, Wales and Tunisia \u2013 pushed their hands recklessly into the air, while thousands of curious locals watched and waved mobile phones.\nSquint hard enough, and those shiny brochure claims about this World Cup being a bridge between east and west due to a shared love of football no longer appeared so fetched. And an hour later, the buzz was even further enhanced by a spectacular and sustained barrage of fireworks before the words \u201cWelcome to Qatar\u201d lit up the Doha skyline and a concert by the Colombian music superstar Maluma began.\n\nPeople cheered. People smiled. And a World Cup that has lurched from criticism to controversy and back again ever since it was awarded to Qatar in 2010 briefly appeared to acquire something new: a tinge of normality.\nIt is likely to prove a mirage, at least for now. There are too many concerns and too few supporters compared with a normal tournament for that, despite Fifa president Gianni Infantino\u2019s bullish claims on Saturday that bringing the World Cup to Qatar had sped up the pace of reform there.\nInfantino pointed to the abolition of the kafala worker sponsorship system and the introduction of a minimum wage of \u00a3231 a month before promising he had received reassurances that the rights of gay people would be respected, at least during the World Cup.\nBut Rasha Younes of Human Rights Watch, who has revealed a number of cases of violence by the Qatari authorities against LGBTQ+ people in the country, told the Observer that far more needed to be done to reinforce such protection.\n\n\u201cFifa has been pretty conservative in its approach to workers and LGBT rights and the rights of women,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd it doesn\u2019t seem to understand the gravity of its responsibility and role in this sporting world, especially in countries such as Qatar with a dismal human rights record.\u201d\nWhat has also long been clear is that this World Cup will be a discombobulating combination of the opulent and the opaque. How could it not when an eye-watering $200bn has reportedly been spent on the tournament, about 20 times more than the last edition in Russia? And when, at the same time, so much remains unspoken? No Qatari official has yet given reassurances that gay fans will not be punished if they kiss. And fans who sink a few alcoholic drinks still don\u2019t know where the boundary will be between over-exuberance and arrest.\nTrue, the stadiums look magnificent, with ground-breaking air conditioning technology inside the grounds ensuring that players and fans will experience temperatures of 22C rather than in the low 30s, which should mean the standard of football is high too.\nYet questions remain about other parts of the infrastructure. How could it be right, for instance, that with only a few hours left until the tournament kicked off, with the host nation playing Ecuador at the Al Bayt stadium , several fan villages still resembled construction sites?\nWhen the Observer visited the Radat Al Jahhaniya fan village, which will house hundreds of England and Wales supporters, there were still piles of rubble and sand strewn everywhere, along with pieces of industrial machinery.\nMeanwhile, it remains to be sene how a country the size of Yorkshire can cope with an expected influx of more than 1 million people, which will inevitably put pressure on the metro and the extra police that have been flown in from Turkey and Pakistan.\n\nHowever Wales supporters John Fraser, and his sons Barry and John Jr, said they had been pleasantly surprised by their early experiences in Qatar so far.\n\u201cThe atmosphere has been amazing,\u201d said John Jr. \u201cThe only difference between this and other tournaments has been the lack of alcohol. We heard the warnings to be careful, but we were sunbathing on the beach earlier and had no problems.\nThe family, from Barry in Wales, said they were paying \u00a337 a night in what they called \u201cvery basic accommodation\u201d.\n\u201cBut we knew what we were getting,\u201d said Barry, smiling. \u201cAnd it\u2019s not too bad. Clearly a lot of money has been spent here and everywhere we go people are smiling and being friendly.\u201d\nThey acknowledged that they were aware of problems with workers and LGBTQ+ rights, which they said had led to some of their friends not travelling. But for them, at least, football trumped everything else.\n\u201cAt the end of the day Wales are not likely to get to a World Cup again in my lifetime,\u201d said John Sr, \u201dso you have to make the most of it.\n\u201cIt was always going to be controversial because of Qatar\u2019s stance on some things but we are here to celebrate togetherness and football,\u201d he added.\nMeanwhile despite being beset by criticism from all sides, Fifa president Infantino is confident that the handwringing by refuseniks and human rights supporters will fade into the background once the first ball is kicked.\n\u201cIt\u2019s like in these polls we have seen very recently,\u201d he said. \u201cIn some countries they say it\u2019s bad to watch the World Cup because it\u2019s in Qatar and it\u2019s Fifa, and look this bad guy. But privately when they go home, of course they watch it.\u201d\n\nWarming to his theme, he added: \u201cBecause when you\u2019re a football fan, there\u2019s nothing bigger than the World Cup. We will have 5 billion people watching it. Those who watch it, officially and privately, they will see the best football ever and they will see the biggest emotions ever.\u201d\nAnd when Infantino gave the familiar promise that we were about to experience the greatest tournament in history, it was possible to detect a twinkle in his eye.\n\u201cDoha is ready,\u201d he proclaimed. \u201cAnd this will be the best World Cup ever. And the magic of football is that as soon as the ball rolls people concentrate on the game. Because that is what people want.\u201d\nThe stark reality, as we all know, is that Infantino will no doubt be proved right."

The news that it will not be sold inside or around the perimeter of stadiums was confirmed by Fifa in a terse statement on Friday afternoon.\nIt said: \u201cFollowing discussions between host country authorities and Fifa, a decision has been made to focus the sale of alcoholic beverages on the Fifa Fan Festival, other fan destinations and licensed venues, removing sales points of beer from Qatar\u2019s World Cup 2022 stadium perimeters.\n\u201cThere is no impact to the sale of Bud Zero, which will remain available at all Qatar\u2019s World Cup stadiums.\u201d\n\nThe statement added: \u201cHost country authorities and Fifa will continue to ensure that the stadiums and surrounding areas provide an enjoyable, respectful and pleasant experience for all fans. The tournament organisers appreciate AB InBev\u2019s [the brewer of Budweiser, Anheuser-Busch InBev] understanding and continuous support to our joint commitment to cater for everyone during the Fifa World Cup Qatar 2022.\u201d\nHowever football\u2019s governing body will now be looking nervously over its shoulders at the prospect of legal action from Budweiser, which has a $75m (\u00a363m) sponsorship agreement with Fifa, and is likely to regard this as a major breach of contract.\nIn a tweet \u2013 since deleted \u2013 moments just before the news became official the US beer brand said: \u201cWell, this is awkward\u2026\u201d\nThe sale of alcohol is strictly controlled in Qatar, a conservative Muslim nation, but organisers had promised it would be available in match venues and in fan zones \u2013 and that it would also be reasonable priced.\nHowever it has now decided that alcohol will be available at matches only in hospitality boxes, where the cheapest suites are nearly \u00a320,000 a match, and some fan zones after 7pm, where it will cost nearly \u00a312 for 500ml of Budweiser.\nThe Guardian understands the decision was taken after the Qataris, as the host nation, decided that everyone inside World Cup stadiums had to feel comfortable \u2013 and that this would not be the case if fans were seen drinking alcohol or turned up drunk.\nIn their view, this is a tournament where there will be a large number of supporters from Gulf and Asian countries, where drinking alcohol is not part of the culture. And whereas there are some alcohol-free fan zones in Doha, in a stadium it is hard to escape people who have been drinking.\nHowever it is unclear why they have taken the decision now and not in the 12 years since winning the right to host the tournament. Until recently organisers had always said that they would find a way to find a middle ground between western fans\u2019 tastes and Qatar\u2019s conservative culture.\nThat message was reiterated most recently by Fatma al-Nuaimi, head of communications for the Supreme Committee, who said: \u201cWhen it comes to alcohol, hospitality is part of our culture, even if alcohol is not. There will be designated areas where drinks will be served, especially the fan zones. So it will be in the places where the fans will gather, but not openly on the streets.\u201d\nThe organisation\u2019s official fan guide also states that \u201cticket holders will have access to Budweiser, Budweiser Zero, and Coca-Cola products within the stadium perimeter\u201d for at least three hours before games, and for one hour afterwards.\nThe news was greeted with frustration by the Football Supporters\u2019 Association, which questioned whether the Qataris could now be trusted on their other promises. \u201cSome fans like a beer at a match and some don\u2019t, but the real issue is the last minute U-turn which speaks to a wider problem \u2013 the total lack of communication and clarity from the organising committee towards supporters,\u201d a spokesperson said.\n\u201cIf they can change their minds on this at a moment\u2019s notice, with no explanation, supporters will have understandable concerns about whether they will fulfil other promises relating to accommodation, transport or cultural issues.\u201d"

                    "body": "Tim Cahill has done a lot of talking these past few weeks. He has pumped up Socceroos players, pressed the flesh at Fifa events and maintained his relationship with Qatar\u2019s World Cup officials.\nSeemingly, the only people to whom he has not spoken is the media. When Cahill was named as Australia\u2019s \u201chead of delegation\u201d on 15 November, the not-unreasonable assumption was that he would have something to say. The caveat, of course, is that making yourself available to say things also opens you up to squirmy questions about who you work for and why.\n\nIt has been almost three years since Cahill joined Samuel Eto\u2019o, Xavi and Cafu in becoming an ambassador for this hugely controversial World Cup. At the time, the Socceroos great was criticised but since then the scrutiny has, in relative terms, been sparse.\nEven now he is protected from the glare, in large part thanks to the global censure directed at his higher-profile counterpart David Beckham, another former player being paid handsomely by the Gulf state, and whose sheen of celebrity has glossed over human rights issues.\n\nBut he must have known that, at some point during the tournament, the queries would come and it would be prudent to prepare some kind of answer. If he has one, nobody knows what it is, because he did not speak. By the time the bulk of Australia\u2019s media landed in Doha three weeks ago, SBS journalist Ben Lewis had already been granted and conducted a brief interview with Cahill. It was brief because Cahill, with the help of a PR officer, shut down a question about the Socceroos\u2019 collective protest against the \u201csuffering\u201d of migrant workers and safety of LGBTI+ people. He walked away without a word. Without even a cursory response or a no comment, just a look of indignation and a turn on his heels.\nAfterwards, Lewis was assured Cahill was not avoiding the issue and would willingly answer questions later in the week. Several days later, Football Australia \u2013 who was not in control of the 42-year-old\u2019s schedule or media commitments \u2013 managed to organise a press conference with Cahill. That was cancelled on short notice due to a schedule clash and never eventuated, despite repeated requests right up until Sunday afternoon.\n\nMembers of the media were told he did not want to divert attention away from the team, an explanation that feels at odds with the selfie video Cahill had distributed on his behalf the day after Australia\u2019s landmark win over Denmark. Guardian Australia received the video unsolicited via an email from Qatar 2022\u2019s Supreme Committee for Delivery &amp; Legacy, the backer of his lucrative ambassadorship. It was also shared with other journalists.\nOver the course of those three weeks on the ground, Australian media were offered the opportunity to speak with almost every member of the Socceroos squad and coaching staff, along with Football Australia\u2019s chief executive, James Johnson, and the federal minister for sport, Anika Wells. Cahill, while silent, was omnipresent, on the pitch at training at the Aspire Academy and in the dressing room before and during games.\nAnd this is the point which complicates the situation. The Socceroos, who qualified only five months before their opening match, would not have secured residence at the world-class Aspire if it were not for Cahill\u2019s role as its chief sports officer. The use of the genuinely impressive facility, albeit one funded by the state and at the centre of Qatar\u2019s Football Dreams project, contributed to Australia\u2019s unprecedented success during the tournament. Its recovery resources are unmatched. Aspetar, the world-renowned orthopaedic and sports medicine hospital, is next door and analysed every inch of the players\u2019 bodies to determine their fitness or otherwise before each match.\n\nWith all of this in mind, it is difficult to form an argument that FA should not have accepted this opportunity and capitalised on the high-performance advantages it offers. On top of this, Cahill has clearly been a supportive figure during the campaign and a source of motivation for the players, many of whom look up to him. The squad were here to play football, and he undoubtedly aided that cause.\nCahill, who lives in Doha, said in 2020 that his Qatar 2022 ambassadorship was \u201ca natural progression for me\u201d. His own website states that part of his role is to \u201cpromote various activities and legacy programmes\u201d run by the Supreme Committee, including workers\u2019 welfare. Had he spoken, he may have chosen to draw on one of the points the made in the Socceroos\u2019 nuanced video, which acknowledged some improvements in the country, including the dismantling of the kafala system and improved working conditions and a minimum wage (though the Socceroos also said more must be done).\nUnfortunately, we do not know what he thinks about any of it. Nor do we know if he has spoken about the issue with the Socceroos, who feel strongly about their cause. This piece would have benefited considerably from Cahill\u2019s input \u2013 it is his right to state his own beliefs for the public record. All we know is that he did not entertain the question before the tournament and did not engage thereafter."

Concerns have been raised over the wellbeing of LGBTQ+ fans who will travel to support England and Wales in the World Cup, given that same-sex relationships are illegal in Qatar.

It has recruited supporters from around the globe, offering travel and accommodation and a place at the World Cup opening ceremony in return for enthusiasm and positive social media content. But the Guardian can reveal that a per diem payment for food and drink, upon which some supporters were depending, was cancelled just as fans were packing to travel to the Gulf.\nMembers of the Fan Leader Network from two European countries said their payments had been cancelled three days ago and that authorities had blamed the decision on the bad press which followed the revelation that fans were being paid.\n\nFans were told in a message, seen by the Guardian: \u201cDue to the recent developments in the media, we are keen to protect our visiting fans from the erroneous misinformed statements regarding \u2018fans receiving payment for the trip\u2019. Accordingly, the daily allowance will unfortunately no longer be issued. The allowance was intended as a small uplift on your own personal funds to assist with refreshments during your stay.\u201d\nAlthough the fans the Guardian spoke to said the loss of money had not deterred anyone from travelling, they were concerned about how they would pay for the rest of their stay. One fan said they had paid for maintenance for their car on the assumption that the per diem would be coming.\nThe email sent to members of the Network said: \u201cWe requested from the outset that you brought sufficient funds to cover your own living expenses and we have committed to cover flights, accommodation and opening match tickets.\u201d\nThe news comes two days before the opening ceremony and follows an announcement by Fifa that it would no longer be possible to buy alcohol at World Cup stadiums. This was a decision widely understood to have been forced on football\u2019s governing body at the last minute by Qatar.\nConcerns will now rise that further commitments made by the organisers could yet be ignored too, including the safety of LGBTQ+ fans in a country where homosexuality is illegal.\nAccording to the terms and conditions of the Fan Leader Network, initially revealed by the Dutch broadcaster NOS, travellers have been asked to promote the tournament and the experience as part of the trip. Key to the deal will be \u201c\u2018liking\u2019 and re-sharing third-party posts\u201d, and fans have reportedly been asked to flag social media content critical of the event.\nOne of the fans spoken to by the Guardian understood this arrangement to be something easily achieved, simply by posting the kind of material they would have done anyway.\nThe executive director of Football Supporters Europe, Ronan Evain, said: \u201cWho would have thought that an authoritarian regime with an appalling workers\u2019 rights record was not to be trusted? I suppose that\u2019s what you get for accepting to be paid the equivalent of a Qatari monthly minimum wage every four days for the pleasure of doing absolutely nothing.\u201d\nQatar\u2019s Supreme Committee for Delivery and Legacy has been approached for comment."

The entire country is about 10 times the size of New York City, and all the games will be held in a tight circle of eight stadiums near the capital, Doha.   Who runs Qatar and how does it make money? The British-educated sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani took over from his father nearly a decade ago and maintains control over nearly all aspects of government. Once one of the poorest Gulf states, Qatar has risen to become one of the wealthiest countries in the world per capita on the back of oil and gas.  What is its role geopolitically? Qatar has an \u201copen-door\u201d foreign policy in which it speaks to all political groups, which is why the country has acted as a mediator, for example, between the Taliban and the US. But Qatar\u2019s support for Islamist groups, such as affiliates of the Muslim Brotherhood and Hamas in Gaza, has caused serious friction with its neighbours. In June 2017, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and Bahrain cut diplomatic ties with Qatar. Saudi Arabia\u2019s role, in particular, meant Qatar was effectively cut off from the rest of the world. The blockade was lifted last year. What is Qatar famous for? The small state has an outsized influence across the region and globally due to its 2006 launch of the influential pan-Arab and international TV broadcaster Al Jazeera. While it is part-owned by the state \u2013 and avoids criticism of the Qatari monarchy \u2013 Al Jazeera has maintained a level of independence in its reporting, making it a vital source of breaking news across the Middle East, particularly during the Arab spring uprisings that erupted in 2011. Dictators across the region detest Al Jazeera, which has closely reported on pro-democracy movements and Islamist uprisings. They accuse Qatar of using the channel to foment strife. Why is this tournament so controversial? Broadly, although not exhaustively, the main arguments made against awarding the tournament to Qatar fall into the following categories:   Migrant workers\u2019 rights  The role of Qatar\u2019s huge migrant worker population \u2013 often from south and east Asia \u2013 in the country\u2019s construction industry has dominated discussions. A Guardian investigation in 2019 found hundreds of labourers had been worked to death in searing temperatures of up to 45C for up to 10 hours per shift, six days a week. Many workers live in squalid, overcrowded dorms, and some interviewed by the Guardian say they earn the equivalent of about \u00a31 an hour. Responding to the criticism, Qatar introduced a minimum wage and abolished the abusive kafala system, under which workers could not change jobs and were effectively controlled by their employers. Nevertheless in October Amnesty International said human rights abuses \u201cpersist on a significant scale\u201d.  LGBTQ+ rights  Qatar criminalises same-sex sexual activity with jail time and the country ranks poorly on indices of LGBTQ+ rights, even by regional standards.  Last month, Human Rights Watch published a report documenting what it claimed was \u201carbitrary\u201d police action against LGBTQ+ residents in Qatar. A Qatari official said the allegations \u201ccontain information that is categorically and unequivocally false\u201d, without specifying. In an effort at global acceptance, Qatar has explicitly said that LGBTQ+ couples visiting for the World Cup can stay in the same room. Documents seen by the Guardian suggest police will be told not to take action against public displays of affection or pro-LGBTQ+ protests. Still, the grey area is a serious cause for concern. Recent remarks by an official tournament ambassador describing homosexuality as \u201cdamage in the mind\u201d have been decried as \u201charmful and unacceptable\u201d.  The climate crisis  Qatar initially proposed holding the tournament during summer, when temperatures average 36C and sometimes reach into the 50s, though in 2015 Fifa confirmed a winter tournament would take place instead.  Doha has promised \u201cthe first carbon-neutral World Cup in history\u201d with its \u201ccompact\u201d design meaning less carbon-emitting travel. But concerns have been expressed over the use of air conditioning in the stadiums and hundreds of thousands of litres of desalinated water needed to keep the pitches lush and green.   Corruption  There is no evidence linking Qatar itself to any kind of corruption in securing its World Cup bid success, but it is 12 years since the host nation was announced, and questions remain about how a country that has never qualified for the tournament won the right to host it. Attention has focused instead on the 22 voting members of Fifa\u2019s executive committee at the time, 16 of whom have been implicated in or investigated over some form of alleged corruption or bad practice. Earlier this month the former Fifa president Sepp Blatter claimed the tournament was handed to the Gulf state because of the actions of the former Uefa president Michel Platini, under pressure from France\u2019s then president Nicolas Sarkozy. Platini, a former France player, acknowledges that a meeting with Sarkozy took place but denies his votes were influenced. Sarkozy has previously chosen not to comment on the allegations. \u2022 This article was amended on 21 November 2022. Qatar is about 10 times the size of New York City, not a 10th of the size as an earlier version said."

                    "body": "\nThe main event\nLouis van Gaal as the sentimental choice to win this World Cup feels like a fault in the space-time continuum. And yet the austere, brusque character who led Ajax to glory in the 1990s and whose tedious freeze-frame football had mid-2010s Manchester United fans barrelling to the concourses has reconfigured as world football\u2019s friendly uncle. His treatment for cancer and the reality that, at 71, this will likely be his final stand on the world stage has softened hearts, though. He has softened, too.\nVan Gaal has also emerged as a rare voice of conscience in an elite class where the next pound will always be chased ahead of principles. \u201cIt\u2019s ridiculous that the World Cup is [in Qatar],\u201d he said earlier this year. \u201cFifa says they want to develop football there. That\u2019s bullshit. It\u2019s about money, about commercial interests.\u201d Take note, David Beckham and others.\n\nWith Fifa set to collect a record $7.5bn of revenue and stadiums dotted with empty seats as the Doha supercity empties out in the tournament\u2019s latter stages, such plain-speaking has been proved correct. Van Gaal, though lately banning political questions as they might distract his team, continues to have the ear of the journalists. Not for him the \u201cwe want to win\u201d or \u201cthis is football\u201d cliches trotted out by his contemporaries.\nAt Fifa\u2019s main media centre on Thursday, the great man\u2019s press conference was a sellout. Those hacks who sat through his United team\u2019s matches would regularly wonder why he couldn\u2019t just do press conferences for a living, such was the richness of entertainment compared to the plodding football out on the field. In Qatar, it\u2019s been much the same. His Netherlands team would win few prizes for artistic impression and, while playing Argentina in the quarter-final recalls the Brilliant Orange team meeting the same opposition in 1974 and 1978, Van Gaal\u2019s team are functional, less-flying Dutchmen and liable to use the long ball.\n\nThe Argentina game also brings Van Gaal up against one of his former United players, \u00c1ngel Di Mar\u00eda, with whom he had a difficult relationship. \u201cMy problem in Manchester was the coach,\u201d said Di Mar\u00eda last year. \u201cVan Gaal was the worst coach I ever had in my career.\u201d On Thursday, the Dutch manager sidestepped the winger\u2019s complaints before delivering one of the comedic gems the hacks had queued up for.\n\u201cWell, he is one of the very few players who ever said that,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd usually it is the other way round \u2026 a head coach sometimes needs to take decisions that don\u2019t always end well. There\u2019s somebody next to me here, Memphis Depay. The same thing happened to him. He also played for Manchester [United] and now we kiss each other, mouth to mouth. We\u2019re not going to do it now.\u201d Cue that uproarious laughter only a room full of journalists can produce.\nShould the Netherlands prevail, they would end the hopes of another sentimental choice to win this World Cup, Lionel Messi, and Van Gaal has a plan for him. \u201cMessi is the most dangerous creative player, he is able to create a lot and to score goals himself,\u201d he said. \u201cBut when they lose the ball he doesn\u2019t participate much, this gives us chances.\u201d\nMany a coach has set a plan for Messi and failed miserably, though few have the experience and charisma of Van Gaal. If defeat to Argentina proves to be his last stand in football, he will be missed. He has proved a man apart in Qatar, and the game needs more leaders like him. JB\n\nTalking points\nBrazil\u2019s collective joy is a positive thing\u201cIt is not being disrespectful to anyone else, that is how we do things, that is us,\u201d Tite says of Brazil\u2019s dancing celebrations. \u201cThis may also help the education of young kids back in school and we will continue doing things in our manner.\u201d Some bemoaned the joy Brazil took in beating South Korea, infuriated by the team\u2019s desire to shake hips on their way to a World Cup quarter-final. Others will see it for what it is: a group of professional athletes playing out their dream in a tournament that is the pinnacle of their lives. Tite was also criticised for bringing on third-choice goalkeeper Weverton, but it meant every player in his squad has had game time in Qatar. It showed the human touch to give a good squad man the chance to play his part at a World Cup. It all adds up to a great togetherness; no player is left behind whether they are on the bench or in the stands injured. Everyone is treated the same, and that will help them in their aim to win the trophy. WU\n\nAdios, Luis EnriqueLuis Enrique exiting his role as Spain manager made him the fifth World Cup coach to depart, following South Korea\u2019s Paulo Bento, Otto Addo of Ghana, Belgium\u2019s Roberto Mart\u00ednez and Gerardo Martino of Mexico. Those four had reached the end of their contracts, but Luis Enrique had a deal in place until the end of this year before Thursday\u2019s mutual parting of ways. \u201cIt is determined a new project should start,\u201d read a Spanish FA (RFEF) statement. A later announcement read: \u201cThe RFEF has chosen Luis de la Fuente as the new national coach.\u201d De La Fuente has been with the national setup since 2013, and led Spain\u2019s Olympic team to the silver medal in Tokyo last year. There he worked with a number of Luis Enrique\u2019s squad. He will have the benefit of youngsters such as Pedri, Gavi and Ansu Fati reaching their peaks but, like Luis Enrique, will have to find the proper centre-forward Spain have lacked since the heydays of Fernando Torres and David Villa. JB\nBeyond the football\nA migrant worker\u2019s death during the tournament has proved a prickly issue for the Qatari hosts. A Filipino man contracted to fix lights in a car park at the Sealine Resort \u2013 the training site used by the Saudi Arabia national team \u2013 died after he reportedly \u201cslipped off a ramp while walking alongside [a] vehicle and fell headfirst against concrete\u201d.\nOfficials in Qatar have launched an investigation, and said \u201cthe company will be subject to legal action and severe financial penalties\u201d, if it is found that \u201csafety protocols were not followed\u201d. When questioned on the matter by reporters, the chief executive of the 2022 World Cup, Nasser Al Khater, responded angrily.\n\u201cDeath is a natural part of life, whether it\u2019s at work, whether it\u2019s in your sleep,\u201d Al Khater said. \u201cWe\u2019re in the middle of a World Cup. And we have a successful World Cup. And this is something you want to talk about right now?\u201d JB\n\nGlobal media-watch\nThe press in the Netherlands expects orange-clad fans to be outnumbered in the Lusail Stadium, with reports that just 1,400 Dutch supporters have obtained tickets. There is at least optimism that the team could progress but De Telegraaf devoted a whole piece to worrying about Frenkie de Jong and Nathan Ak\u00e9 potentially being suspended for the semi-finals if they are booked against Argentina.\nIn De Volkskrant, William Vissers compared Van Gaal to the legendary Rinus Michels, adding that the current Netherlands coach has changed with the game. \u201cVan Gaal is willing to admit that he is milder than before, but only in behaviour. Not in vision, in the execution of ideas. Then he is strict and sharp. Beyond that, ahead: smoother, softer. The authoritarian coach no longer fits in with football anyway, and certainly not in a tournament where it\u2019s all about team spirit.\u201d \nAcross the border in Germany, fingers are still being pointed after the team\u2019s early exit. According to Bild, a two-hour crisis meeting raised concerns about a \u201choliday feeling\u201d at the team\u2019s training base. Hansi Flick\u2019s side were based at the Zulal Wellness Resort, a three-hour round-trip from Doha, and reports suggest some players found the vibe a little too laid-back. Flick has dismissed the criticism and turned his focus to Euro 2024, where Germany will be hosts. \u201cWe have missed a great opportunity,\u201d Flick said of Qatar. \u201cWe will learn our lessons.\u201d MBe/NMc\nThe internet reacts\nLuis Enrique is not the only live streamer to feature prominently during this World Cup. Sergio Ag\u00fcero is also a Twitcher, or whatever the kids are calling it these days, and dropped by his old teammates on Wednesday to judge Papu G\u00f3mez\u2019s new haircut. The Briefing reckons it\u2019s a bit more Walter Samuel than David Beckham, but we\u2019ll let you be the judge \u2026\n\nToday\u2019s matches\nCroatia v Brazil, 3pm GMT The unstoppable force meets the immovable object in the first of the four quarter-finals. Tite has encouraged his Brazil team to start games aggressively \u2013 \u201cWe want to score goals quickly, so later we can feel more comfortable\u201d \u2013 but in Croatia they meet the masters of the World Cup slugfest. Zlatko Dalic\u2019s side beat Denmark and Russia on penalties (and England in extra time) to reach the 2018 final, and prevailed in another shootout to get past Japan on Monday. \u201cOur last match is confirmation we can do it again,\u201d warned Luka Modric. \u201cWe\u2019re prepared for anything.\u201d NMc\nNetherlands v Argentina, 7pm GMT Friday\u2019s later game is a fixture to fire the senses, even on paper. The 1978 final, the unforgettable 1998 quarter-final and a tense tussle in the semi-finals in 2014 \u2013 their meetings rarely disappoint, save for a group-stage stalemate in 2006. Croatia or Brazil await the victors in the semi-finals. NMc\nAnd finally \u2026\nAs Portugal played down reports that Cristiano Ronaldo threatened to leave their World Cup training camp after being dropped, Tyson Fury weighed in with his advice on growing old gracefully. \u201cThe age factor will not wait for anybody, no matter how you\u2019ve lived,\u201d the 34-year-old Fury told TalkSport. \u201cEven Ronaldo is on the slide now,\u201d the world heavyweight champion added before serving up an exceedingly strange analogy. \u201cIf you look at Ronaldo, he\u2019s 37 years old, he\u2019s had the best doctors, the best physiotherapists \u2013 he\u2019s lived like an egg in Mr Kipling\u2019s cake.\u201d NMc"

                    "body": "Sunday My colleague Sid Lowe and I decide to take a leisurely stroll to the nearby Al Bidda Park. Good news: it\u2019s only 15 minutes away. Bad news: you have to dodge a six-lane dual carriageway to get there. The park is practically deserted and the view of the glittering ocean only marginally tarnished by the enormous sewage pipe flowing into it. A timely and poignant reminder that in Qatar all beauty is fatally tinged by ugliness. Later, Spain draw 1-1 with Germany. Monday Portugal v Uruguay feels like a game that demands a stiff drink. So I seek out a sports bar in West Bay, order a pint of Stella Artois (other \u00a312 flavours of water are available) and chew on a chicken burger so gristly I have to check it for feathers. I ponder upon the choices that have led us to this point, the various production lines of suffering and indignity that have brought this chicken and I face to face, one of us smothered in imitation mayonnaise, the other smothered in shame. Portugal win 2-0.  Tuesday The French broadcaster Julien Laurens has organised a friendly six-a-side kickabout between ESPN and a team of English journalists. At least, that was our broad understanding. The first sign that the opposition may be taking this a little too seriously comes when they arrive with a) a camera crew and b) the ex-Manchester City defender Nedum Onuoha. As the poor perspiring English toil in the brutal heat, every ESPN goal is greeted with wild celebrations, aggressive slaps and even the occasional taunt (not from Onuoha of course, who appears mildly bewildered by the whole experience). From the other side of the chain-link fence a group of migrant workers gaze upon us with a mixture of envy, pity and curiosity. England beat Wales 3-0. Wednesday Sid is going to try to use the washing machine for the first time. Don\u2019t do it, I warn him. You know what happened in Barney Ronay\u2019s and Jonathan Wilson\u2019s flat. The thing whirred for five hours, flooded the kitchen and their clothes came out dry. Jacob Steinberg couldn\u2019t even get his to turn on. But I\u2019m out of pants, he pleads. And so he loads the drum. The next two hours drip with tension. Eventually the machine plays a jolly jingle, Sid opens the door and triumphantly announces that his clothes are clean. It\u2019s the purest joy we\u2019ve experienced all tournament. Do we shed a tear? That, I\u2019m afraid, will have to stay between us. Argentina beat Poland 2-0. Thursday The fridge is virtually empty apart from a block of halloumi, so I chop it into bits and eat it for breakfast while watching the Pakistan v England Test match. This is nice, I think to myself, and immediately chastise myself. In a way, we\u2019re cursed. Every good feeling is lined with guilt. Every moment of enjoyment in a stadium is freighted with the knowledge of its cost. Every misfortune is framed by the fact that actually, we\u2019re the lucky ones. There is no real happiness to be found here, and this is exactly how it was intended. Germany beat Costa Rica 4-2 but go out on goal difference. My children have left me a voice note asking when I\u2019m coming home. Friday I return from the Germany game at 4.30am. Sleep until early afternoon. There\u2019s a problem with the microchip in my accreditation pass so I go to the media centre to get it replaced and miss the last shuttle bus to Al Janoub Stadium. I arrive just in time to watch Uruguay beat Ghana 2-0. Afterwards the Uruguayans are furious at being knocked out and having to go home. From the press box I regard them with a mixture of pity, envy and curiosity. What have we all become?  Saturday \u201cAll OK for the diary?\u201d asks Jon on the Guardian editor\u2019s desk. \u201cAll fine,\u201d I reply, \u201cI just don\u2019t have an ending yet.\u201d \u201cThere are no endings,\u201d he says. \u201cNothing ever really ends. Things happen and then we just move on to the next thing.\u201d Maybe he\u2019s right. I press \u201csend\u201d on the diary, put on my accreditation, pick up my bag, and get the metro to Argentina v Australia."

                    "body": "\n\nThe main event\nLet\u2019s start with news from Brazil, where the five-times champions were among the first nations to confirm their final 26-player squad for Qatar. The big surprise was the inclusion of Dani Alves, who will be 40 next spring and, should he play, will become the third-oldest outfield player at a World Cup (only Argentina\u2019s \u00c1ngel Labruna and Cameroon\u2019s Roger Milla were older). It was expected the wily full-back would wind down his career at Universidad Nacional in Mexico but his inclusion on the flight to Doha suggests he will be winding it right back up again. Well, if he\u2019s fit.\nAlves suffered a knee injury on 1 October and hasn\u2019t played since. Not that this bothers the head coach, Tite, who waxed lyrical about the veteran\u2019s skills and attitude this week. \u201cHe adds technical and tactical aspects that are impressive, to be an organiser, an articulator,\u201d he said. \u201cSure he is not a 60-to-70-metres player any more, but he has other virtues \u2026 mental and physical aspects too.\u201d Perhaps a role as a vibes man awaits. There were few other surprises in the Neymar-led squad besides the omission of Roberto Firmino, who can be forgiven for feeling a little miffed having scored eight times for Liverpool this season while still working his selfless socks off.\nOn to a couple of talismans now. There has been concern in the Senegal camp over the fitness of Sadio Man\u00e9, the hero who hauled his nation past Egypt in a playoff for Qatar, but he has been named in their squad. The forward limped off during Bayern Munich\u2019s 6-1 win over Werder Bremen, with the club initially playing down the severity of an injury to his right fibula, before L\u2019\u00c9quipe weighed in to suggest he might be facing a lengthy layoff that would rule him out of the Group A opener against Netherlands. Nevertheless, fears of surgery have now been allayed. \u201cI prefer to keep him in the squad because he is such an important part of us,\u201d said the Senegal coach, Aliou Ciss\u00e9.\n\nThere is also optimistm for South Korea, who feared Son Heung-min would have to watch their matches from his sofa after fracturing an eye socket for Tottenham in Marseille. But after successful surgery the forward has confirmed he shall go to the ball \u2013 though there is clearly still some healing to be done. \u201cI won\u2019t miss this for the world. I can\u2019t wait to represent our beautiful country,\u201d he wrote on Instagram. \u201cWhen I think of the masks you\u2019ve been patiently wearing for over two years, my mask that I\u2019ll be wearing at the World Cup matches is nothing. If there is only 1% chance, I will look at that possibility.\u201d\n\nPerennial dark horses Switzerland will have one of the most experienced squads after Murat Yakin named Granit Xhaka, appearing in his third tournament, along with the centre-back Fabian Sch\u00e4r and Xherdan Shaqiri, who is looking forward to his fourth World Cup. Manchester City\u2019s Manuel Akanji is also included as well as Monaco\u2019s Breel Embolo, who will lead the frontline, and the talented uncapped 20-year-old Young Boys midfielder Fabian Rieder. So pleased with the deep Swiss pool he had to pick from, Yakin said: \u201cWe were spoiled for choice.\u201d That\u2019s a confident outlook. Another old campaigner, Luka Modric, will captain Croatia in his fourth finals in a squad that hasn\u2019t changed much over the years, with Ivan Perisic, Mateo Kovacic and Dejan Lovren all included for another dose of national service.\nNot many would give Australia a fighting chance of reaching the latter rounds after Graham Arnold took stock of injuries and finally named an eclectic mix of players that he called the \u201cboxing kangaroos\u201d. Seventeen of the 26 will be playing in their first World Cup and Garang Kuol\u2019s inclusion is reminiscent of Theo Walcott\u2019s with England in 2006. Kuol, who will join Newcastle United in the Premier League this January, is yet to start a senior league match but is being taken as an \u201cimpact player\u201d in Group D. If the 18-year-old lives up to his punchy billing perhaps the Socceroos will have a chance of giving one of France, Denmark or Tunisia a black eye. The gloves are off. GB\nTalking points\nMaddison makes cut for EnglandAn England squad announcement requires a wildcard to be worth its salt. This year\u2019s model is James Maddison, who also happens to have been one of the Premier League\u2019s best players this season, even amid Leicester\u2019s early struggles. He seems set for the same status enjoyed by Jack Grealish at Euro 2020, when Gareth Southgate faced repeated calls from fans and media to blood someone different and exciting. Maddison and Chelsea\u2019s Conor Gallagher, called up ahead of Manchester United\u2019s Jadon Sancho and James Ward-Prowse, were the surprise choices in a squad full of attacking players, including Newcastle\u2019s Callum Wilson as reserve striker to Harry Kane. That rather flew in the face of those who personify Southgate as a negative manager. For Maddison to play a part he has considerable talent ahead of him, not least from Jude Bellingham, 19 and looking like a guaranteed starter. JB\n\nPage puts faith in Bale and Allen, fit or notRob Page conceded that two of his key players have question marks hanging over their fitness as he announced his Wales squad. The nation\u2019s superstar captain, Gareth Bale, is yet to complete 90 minutes since his move to Major League Soccer in June, though he did come from the bench to score an extra-time equaliser to help LAFC win their first MLS title earlier this month. \u201cHas he played as many minutes as we\u2019d like? Probably not,\u201d said Page. \u201cHe\u2019s proved time and time again when he puts the Welsh jersey on, irrespective of how many minutes he\u2019s played at domestic level, he\u2019s always produced.\u201d Swansea\u2019s Joe Allen is the other player who Page was happy to take a risk on when it came to his fitness. Page sees the 32-year-old Swansea midfielder as key to making his philosophy work on the pitch. \u201cIf he\u2019s fit, he\u2019s playing. He\u2019s massive for how I play and the success we\u2019ve had\u2026 he knows the game inside out and that\u2019s invaluable.\u201d GB\nBenzema to be France\u2019s talisman At 34, Karim Benzema last month became the oldest first-time winner of the Ballon d\u2019Or since Stanley Matthews in 1956. He has waited 12 years to play at his second World Cup, the last being the 2010 tournament lit up by Les Bleus having the m\u00e8re of all rows, as players staged a revolution against horoscope-enthusiast coach Raymond Domenech before crashing out in the group stage. Benzema only returned to the national team in time for Euro 2020, having been exiled in a blackmail case involving teammate Mathieu Valbuena where the Real Madrid forward was found guilty by a court. In a France squad shorn of Paul Pogba and N\u2019Golo Kant\u00e9, the engine of their 2018 triumph, Benzema has belatedly become his country\u2019s standard bearer with Kylian Mbapp\u00e9, though his own fitness is in doubt. Benzema last started a club game on 19 October, having struggled with muscle problems. JB\n\nBeyond the football\nIt was a big week for Sepp Blatter as the former Fifa president admitted handing the World Cup to Qatar in the first place was a \u201cmistake\u201d and a \u201cbad choice\u201d. The 86-year-old told the Swiss newspaper Tages-Anzeiger the decision was a result of secret political pressure, a claim he has made before. \u201cIt\u2019s too small a country,\u201d he said. \u201cFootball and the World Cup are too big for that.\u201d Khalid Salman, a former Qatar international footballer and Qatar World Cup ambassador, caused outrage when he described homosexuality as \u201cdamage in the mind\u201d. Rasha Younes of the LGBT rights program at Human Rights Watch said Salman\u2019s comments were \u201charmful and unacceptable\u201d. Meanwhile, England\u2019s largest LGBTQ+ supporters\u2019 group, Three Lions Pride, criticised David Beckham for becoming a paid ambassador for Qatar 2022, calling the former midfielder\u2019s decision \u201cincredibly disappointing\u201d. And the human rights group Equidem has released a report calling for compensation for migrant workers, who it says faced nationality-based discrimination, illegal recruitment practices and, in some cases, unpaid wages. GB\n\nEarly own goal\nThis World Cup\u2019s association with concerns over human rights does not make for much of a sales deck for potential advertisers. But it was seen as an opportunity for BrewDog, the publicity-conscious brewery, when they launched an \u201canti-advertising campaign\u201d. In announcing that all profits from sales of their Lost Lager brand would be directed to causes \u201cfighting human rights abuses\u201d, they declared: \u201cThis isn\u2019t a World Cup. It\u2019s a World F*Cup. Football\u2019s been dragged through the mud before a single ball\u2019s been kicked.\u201d It wasn\u2019t long before pictures of BrewDog products on sale in Qatar were circulating. World Cup games will also be shown in their outlets. \u201cWe don\u2019t sell direct to Qatar, but we do have a relationship with a distributor that sells into multiple Middle Eastern markets,\u201d doubled down a riposte. \u201cApple sells iPhones in Qatar \u2013 that doesn\u2019t mean it endorses human rights abuses.\u201d Marketing Week reported that Unite Hospitality called this \u201cyet another disingenuous advertising campaign designed to distract customers from the fact BrewDog is one of the worst employers in the brewing industry when it comes to doing the right thing by its workers\u201d. JB\nExperts\u2019 Network\nAs part of a unique collaboration between some of the world\u2019s best media outlets, a series of team guides are bringing a local flavour and expertise to our coverage of this World Cup. You can find them all here, but here\u2019s a taster from Tomasz Wlodarczyk\u2019s Poland preview:\n\nUsually there is a lot of discussion about learning from past failures but this time the general consensus among the public seems to be: \u201cDeeds, not words.\u201d As always a lot rests on Robert Lewandowski, a striker who can score against any defence, and this time he is surrounded by players in form: Sebastian Szymanski is blossoming at Feyenoord while Piotr Zielinski is having a fantastic season as part of a lethal Napoli machine. Maybe qualifying for the knockout stage is a wish that can finally come true.\n\n\nAnd finally \u2026\nAs warm-ups before a first bow at the World Cup go, Facundo Tello made a global splash last Sunday, when issuing 10 [ten] red cards during Argentina\u2019s Champions Trophy final. Seven went the way of Boca Juniors players while three were waved at Racing Club. A player from each team had already been given their marching orders after a full-time melee with the score at 1-1. But the real drama came in extra time. Following Carlos Alcaraz\u2019s 118th-minute header for Racing and a provocative celebration in front of Boca fans, all hell broke loose. Tello saw his only course of action as reducing the game to 12 players, starting with Alcaraz and going from there. No stranger to multiple red cards back in Argentina, this will not be his first trip to Qatar, having officiated at the 2019 Arab Cup, a test event for the big one.

                    "body": "Far from acting as a bridge between different cultures, the first football World Cup hosted by an Arab Muslim country has ended up mired in recrimination and ill-feeling, less a celebration of sport\u2019s soft power and reach than a display of its limits.\nInstead of burnishing Qatar\u2019s image in the west in these globalised but polarised times, it looks to have tarnished it. Inside the small, fabulously wealthy peninsula state, which plays an extremely active role on the world stage, the drumbeat of criticism is no longer interpreted as perplexing and frustrating, but instead as something born of jealousy and racism.\nIn a speech to the Shura council, the state\u2019s legislative body, on 25 October, Qatar\u2019s ruler, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, expressed a degree of bitterness about what he saw as a decade of relentless attacks. The emir did not quite say he wished his country was shot of the whole jamboree, but he certainly sounded as if it was through with apologising to westerners.\n\u201cSince we won the honour of hosting the World Cup, Qatar has been subjected to an unprecedented campaign that no host country has ever faced,\u201d he said. \u201cWe initially dealt with the matter in good faith, and even considered that some criticism was positive and useful, helping us to develop aspects that need to be developed. But it soon became clear to us that the campaign was continuing, expanding and including fabrication and double standards, until it reached a level of ferocity that made many question, unfortunately, [its] reasons and motives.\u201d\n\nQatar has come in for severe criticism on a number of fronts, but in particular for its treatment of migrant workers, anti LGBTQ+ laws, and restrictions on freedom of speech.\nSheikh Tamim insisted the World Cup would still serve as a great advert for Qatar, but as the clock counts down to the opening match on 20 November, the challenges to Qatar\u2019s narrative of a modernising, dexterous Gulf state are mounting.\nThe Danish team will wear shirts with a \u201cfaded\u201d manufacturer\u2019s logo, because the maker Hummel \u201cdoes not want to be visible in tournaments that cost lives\u201d. Australia\u2019s team produced a video raising concerns about the \u201csuffering\u201d of migrant workers and about Qatari LGBTQ+ people\u2019s inability \u201cto love the person that they choose\u201d. Eight of the 32 teams plan to wear a form of rainbow armband in support of LGBTQ+ rights.\n\nLondon declared that it would not host fan zones or public screenings of matches. Paris \u2013 home of the Qatar-sponsored Paris Saint-Germain \u2013 and several other French cities did the same. The BBC quoted the mayor of Lille as describing this year\u2019s tournament as \u201cnonsense in terms of human rights, the environment and sport\u201d. In Britain, the Labour party said it was boycotting the World Cup, and MPs who have visited Qatar on free trips have been called out in the press.\nA Netflix documentary, Fifa Uncovered, hardly added to the sense of legitimacy of the event, raking over allegations \u2013 denied by all the parties involved \u2013 that Qatar bribed the World Cup selection committee.\n\nOne Qatari official complained: \u201cThe UK media is the worst. Everything gets twisted. We are damned if we do and damned if we don\u2019t.\u201d He highlighted a Guardian article from 2021 that said 6,500 migrant workers had died in Qatar since it was awarded the tournament in 2010.\nThe biggest diplomatic row so far has involved Germany\u2019s interior minister, Nancy Faeser, who before a long-planned visit said: \u201cThere are criteria that must be adhered to and it would be better that tournaments are not awarded to such states [as Qatar].\u201d In response, Qatar summoned the German ambassador.\nQatar\u2019s World Cup now divides not just high politics but celebrity culture. Richard Madeley, the British TV presenter, recently opined: \u201cRobbie Williams going to Qatar for money, and Black Eyed Peas going to Qatar for money, and David Beckham endorsing Qatar for money \u2026 they\u2019re all endorsing the regime. Well, they don\u2019t have to say yes, they don\u2019t have to go.\u201d\nEveryone now has an opinion about Qatar, and not just in the west. In some parts of the noisy Middle East social media, a mood of angry, patriotic Arab unity has grown, including in Gulf states that have been at loggerheads with Qatar for a decade. One popular hashtag says in Arabic: \u201cI am Arab and I support Qatar.\u201d\nIn a post that is typical of the mood, one person said: \u201cEveryone who claims to love Qatar has to prove what he says. Doha today is subjected to the most heinous attacks from the arrogant west, which sees us as just Arab societies from the third world and sees Qatar hosting the World Cup as a wrong decision.\u201d\nThe anger does not seem to be manufactured. At a recent game in Iraq, fans from the Baghdad-based Air Force club unfurled a banner saying: \u201cWe stand with Qatar 2022.\u201d An Arab League meeting in Algiers even included in its final declaration a rejection of \u201cthe malicious campaigns of distortion and scepticism that affect [the tournament]\u201d.\nA recent cartoon on the front cover of the French satirical magazine Le Canard encha\u00een\u00e9, showing bearded Qatari footballers brandishing axes, guns and rocket launchers, led to further outcry.\n\nThe challenge to Qatar\u2019s treatment of migrant workers is being branded as deeply hypocritical, given Europe\u2019s own sometimes callous treatment of migrants. Al Jazeera Arabic, part-owned by the Qatari government, heavily advertised a documentary investigating the treatment of Arab and African migrants along Greece\u2019s border with Turkey. The trailer for the film said: \u201cGreece recruits shadow army mercenaries to expel, strike, intimidate and prevent refugees.\u201d\nIn this increasingly polarised atmosphere, those calling for understanding struggle for a hearing. Sigmar Gabriel, the former German foreign minister, briefly put his head above the parapet to suggest greater mutual tolerance. \u201cIt also took us decades to become a liberal country,\u201d he said on 29 October. \u201cProgress does not come overnight, but step by step. That was true for Germany and is true for Qatar now. The UN, the International Labour Organization praised the country for its reforms. Only we Germans insult it every day.\u201d Gabriel, it was pointed out, sat on the supervisory board of a bank owned by Qatar.\nFaeser, after her eventual visit which lasted only 24 hours, also looked for common ground, saying: \u201cEven now there are signs that Qatar is on the right track, especially compared to other states in the region. When you see Qatar is the only country far and wide that has a minimum wage, and where salaries not paid are taken over by the government, that at least encourages me.\u201d German media pointed out that German utility firms badly need Qatar\u2019s liquid gas.\n\nQatar\u2019s initial reaction to criticism after winning the World Cup was largely to keep its head down and wait for the storm to pass. Some in the country\u2019s army of PR people now acknowledge privately that it took too many deaths and campaigns by international unions \u2013 ranging from safety standards to hours worked in the searing summer temperatures \u2013 for Qatar\u2019s business community to address the systematic exploitation of migrant workers.\nLabour unions as well as the UN\u2019s International Labour Organization (ILO), which has had a permanent office in Doha since 2018, say there has now been not just engagement with the problem but a \u201ctransformation\u201d in Qatar\u2019s approach to migrant workers.\nIn 2018, reforms finally allowed workers to leave the country without first securing an exit permit, and in 2020 workers were allowed to change jobs before the end of a contract without employer permission, in effect abolishing the exploitative kafala system. In a report published on 31 October, the ILO said more than 348,450 applications to change jobs had been approved between 1 November 2020 and 31 August 2022. It acknowledged, however, that \u201ca number of unscrupulous employers have retaliated against workers who applied to change jobs. This retaliation can take the form of threats of deportation, cancelling residency permits or filing absconding charges.\u201d\nIn March 2021, a minimum wage was introduced, worth $275 a month, along with minimum standards for food and accommodation. It was not raised in 2022. Outdoor work is prohibited between 10am and 3.30pm from 1 June to 15 September, a significantly longer period than in any other country in the region\nBut the ILO report shows there is still a widespread problem of late payment of wages, and 21,000 complaints were filed to the ministry of labour in 2021 alone. An Amnesty International-backed plan for a $420m (\u00a3350m) compensation fund for the families of workers who died building the stadiums has been parried by Qatar, which says it is a matter for Qatar and a compensation fund exists. \nOne Qatar official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said: \u201cIt may be trendy to bash Qatar, but there is a danger other Gulf states are going to look at how Doha has been rewarded [for its reforms] and ask is it worth following suit.\u201d\nAnother adviser said Qatar\u2019s leadership \u201cfeel the goalposts keep shifting. They feel they engage with the criticism in good faith and then everything they do gets banked as either not enough, or the caravan moves on to other issues, such as homosexuality, that are less negotiable for a conservative society.\u201d\n\nA carefully planned protest in late October by the campaigner Peter Tatchell has been another flashpoint. He surprised the Doha authorities by staging a demonstration, unprecedented in the city, outside the National Museum of Qatar with a sign that read \u201cQatar arrests and subjects LGBTs to conversion\u201d while wearing a T-shirt with the hashtag #QatarAntiGay.\nTatchell, speaking to the Guardian from Sydney, defended himself from a charge of cultural imperialism levelled by some in the region. \u201cI don\u2019t take the view that west is best or west versus the Arab world,\u201d he said. \u201cTo me the principle is universal human rights. I am fighting for the same rights in Britain, Russia and the Middle East. Qatar is a signatory to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which states categorically all people are entitled to equal protection. All I am doing is asking Qatar to honour the commitments it signed up to under the UN.\u201d\nOne of the ironies is that although many Muslims accuse the west of now trying to export its moral depravity, it was British colonialism, under the guise of modernisation, that in the 19th century introduced penal codes making homosexuality punishable.\nTatchell said: \u201cI accept ultimately change has to come from within, but I am supporting the very brave Qataris who are trying to bring that change,\u201d adding that there was nothing in the Qur\u2019an that set a punishment for homosexuality.\nAgain, the facts about Qatar are in dispute. Human Rights Watch documented six cases of severe and repeated beatings and five cases of sexual harassment in police custody between 2019 and 2022. It said security forces mandated that detained transgender women attend so-called conversion therapy sessions at a government-sponsored \u201cbehavioural healthcare\u201d centre. Tatchell said he had personally counselled one Qatari gay person who was broken and humiliated by attending a conversion course.\nQatar likes to defend its conservative culture, saying \u201cwe are not Dubai\u201d, yet at the same time there is sometimes a gap between the law and its enforcement. \u201cWhat people do in the four walls of their hotel is up to them. If two guys book a hotel room together or show some PDA [public displays of affection], there is no morality police here,\u201d said one official.\nThis stance was undercut on 7 November when Khalid Salman, a former footballer and an ambassador for the tournament, told a German reporter that homosexuality was wrong because it was \u201cdamage in the mind\u201d.\n\nA question now is how Qatar emerges politically and emotionally from its bruising World Cup experience. Will it be less active on the global scene?\nRegardless of its physical size, Qatar will remain a country the west cannot afford to ignore. It produces 77m tonnes of liquefied natural gas a year, about a quarter of the world\u2019s production, making it as big a player as Australia and the US.\nThat figure will increase to 126m tonnes by 2026-27, an expansion being undertaken in conjunction with Shell and the French firm Total. With German private household gas prices rising by 17.7% in the first half of this year as it weans itself off Russian gas supplies, Qatar becomes critical.\nQatar, a believer in long-term contracts lasting as long as 15-20 years, feels it is in a strong bargaining position. Europe, for its part, probably only wants LNG up to 2030 at the latest, owing to its decarbonisation agenda. \nMuch will turn on Qatar\u2019s elusive political trajectory. In The People Want: A Radical Exploration of the Arab Spring, the Lebanese academic Gilbert Achcar wrote about how Qatar\u2019s previous emir, Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani, was different from his Gulf peers.\n\u201cRather than automobiles, weapons and the hunt (the Gulf sheikh\u2019s traditional pastimes) or even business, the post-independence generation\u2019s more recent hobby,\u201d he wrote, \u201cthe emir would appear to be enamoured of foreign policy,\u201d using the state\u2019s huge resources to pursue an international influence out of all proportion to the size of the state.\nQatar\u2019s leaders insist they will still see the west as an ally and not just a location for investments. In a sign of Qatar\u2019s importance to the US, Joe Biden in January officially appointed Qatar as a non-Nato strategic ally, a status few countries enjoy.\nBut it knows the enemies that surround it in the region may have withdrawn only temporarily and could return if, for instance, Donald Trump is re-elected. It was Trump who in effect give his blessing to a Saudi-led effort launched in June 2017 to throttle the country\u2019s independence by imposing a land, sea and air boycott. From that point, anything was fair game, including Qatar\u2019s World Cup bid, as the two sides hacked into each other\u2019s internet, spread disinformation and rendered the Gulf Cooperation Council obsolete.\nQatar, with its innovative Al Jazeera channel, had during the Arab spring infuriated Riyadh by showing its independent streak in backing Muslim Brotherhood groups in Libya, Syria and Egypt.\nQatar may well have only survived as an independent state because two members of the Republican administration, Rex Tillerson and Jim Mattis, managed to quell Trump\u2019s support for the Saudi campaign. They pointed out that Qatar, far from being a pro-terrorism state, hosted the largest no-conditions-asked airbase in the Gulf, something Trump, enveloped in ignorance but courted by the Saudis, had overlooked.\nSince the end of the blockade in 2021, the core differences in the Gulf remain. Qatar has continued to base its approach to geopolitical security on gas, soft-power projects such as the World Cup, and ferocious international diplomacy.\nQatar\u2019s foreign ministry acts like a mini UN mediation service, hosting radical groups such as Hamas and the Taliban, not out of support but instead in pursuit of conflict resolution and dialogue. From Darfur to Afghanistan to Iran, it offers its services with mixed outcomes.\nIt is an irony that this advocate of dialogue and mutual understanding has found it impossible to stop the World Cup turning into such a divisive event."

                    "body": "Handing the World Cup to Qatar was a \u201cmistake\u201d and a \u201cbad choice\u201d according to the former Fifa president Sepp Blatter, who has repeated claims the decision was a result of secret political pressure.\nBlatter says the tournament was handed to the Gulf state because of the actions of the former Uefa president, Michel Platini, under pressure from France\u2019s then president, Nicolas Sarkozy. \u201cFor me it is clear: Qatar is a mistake. The choice was bad,\u201d Blatter told the Swiss newspaper Tages-Anzeiger. \u201cAt the time, we actually agreed in the executive committee that Russia should get the 2018 World Cup and the USA that of 2022. It would have been a gesture of peace if the two longstanding political opponents had hosted the World Cup one after the other.\u201d\n\nAsked why Qatar was a bad choice, Blatter made no mention of the human rights concerns that have hung over the tournament, but said: \u201cIt\u2019s too small a country. Football and the World Cup are too big for that.\u201d\nBlatter said that Fifa\u2019s plans were disrupted by Platini, claiming the Frenchman was instrumental in directing four votes from European countries to Qatar, after pressure from Sarkozy.\n\u201cThanks to the four votes of Platini and his [Uefa] team, the World Cup went to Qatar rather than the United States. It\u2019s the truth,\u201d Blatter said of the 14-8 voting result against the US in the final two.\n\u201cPlatini told me he had been invited to the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace, where French president Sarkozy had just had lunch with the Crown Prince of Qatar,\u201d Blatter said. \u201cSarkozy said to Platini: \u2018See what you and your colleagues from Uefa can do for Qatar when the World Cup is awarded.\u2019 I then asked him: \u2018And now?\u2019\u201d\nAccording to Blatter, when he queried this, Platini\u2019s response was: \u201c\u2018Sepp, what would you do if your president asked you for something?\u2019 I then told him that the question didn\u2019t arise for me because we don\u2019t have a president in Switzerland.\u201d\n\nPlatini was questioned by French officials in 2019 as part of an investigation into the 2022 bidding process. The former France player acknowledges that the meeting with Sarkozy took place but denies his votes were influenced.\nIn 2013 he told the Guardian: \u201cI knew Sarkozy wanted the people from Qatar to buy PSG. I understood that Sarkozy supported the candidature of Qatar. But he never asked me, or to vote for Russia [for 2018]. He knows my personality. I always vote for what is good for football. Not for myself, not for France.\u201d Sarkozy has previously chosen not to comment on the World Cup allegations.\nBlatter, in his first interview since he and Platini were acquitted of fraud in July \u2013 although that verdict is the subject of an appeal \u2013 also struck out against his replacement at Fifa, criticising Gianni Infantino for living in Qatar in the buildup to the tournament.\n\nInfantino moved from Switzerland to Doha last year and Blatter suggested the move could compromise Infantino\u2019s decisions. \u201cWhat I\u2019m wondering: why is the new Fifa president living in Qatar?\u201d Blatter said. \u201cHe can\u2019t be the head of the local World Cup organisation. That\u2019s not his job. There are two organising committees for this \u2013 a local one and one from Fifa.\n\u201cThe Fifa president should have the ultimate supervision. An example: there is a proposal to set up a fund for the deceased workers and the bereaved. Qatar says no. What should Fifa say if their president is in the same boat as Qatar?\u201d\nInfantino has made a declared priority of increasing transparency within Fifa since Blatter\u2019s 40-year era at the organisation ended in several claims of corruption and the arrest of multiple Fifa officials by the FBI. Blatter, asked by Tages-Anzeiger of his opinion of Infantino, said: \u201cHe\u2019s a disrespectful person to me.\u201d Fifa has been approached for comment."

                    "body": "With 48 matches and the whole of the group stage in Qatar behind us now, here are some of the things we have learnt so far \u2026\n1 Time flies when you are having fun\nFifa has insisted on referees meticulously adding time that has been \u201clost\u201d on goal celebrations, VAR decisions and general time-wasting. It was initially astonishing to be seeing nine or 10 minutes added at half-time and at the end of games, but halfway through the group stage fans seem to have mentally readjusted to being disappointed that the officials had added only six or seven minutes extra play. And when the conclusions of games have been as much fun as Portugal v Ghana or as tense as Ecuador v Senegal, who wouldn\u2019t want more?\n\n2 Pulling off one upset isn\u2019t enough\nMorocco and Japan upset the odds to top their groups, but both of them needed more than one shock result to do it. Japan managed identikit comebacks from a goal down to beat both Germany and Spain 2-1 to progress. Morocco added a defeat of Belgium to their draw with Croatia, giving them the springboard for success. But one shock is not enough, as Saudi Arabia proved. They could not capitalise on their stunning opening win against Argentina. Though it will still rank as one of the greatest World Cup shocks, and the Saudis got a national holiday out of it, Argentina ended up top of the group and in the last 16, and Saudi Arabia did not.\n\nAnd imagine telling Cameroon before the tournament started that they would beat Brazil and draw with Serbia and still not qualify?\n3 Semi-automated offside is a chore\nThe idea of using sensors in the ball and motion tracking of players to assist in making marginal offside decisions isn\u2019t terrible in and of itself. However, the implementation, rather than speeding up decision-making, seems to have led to a plague of fussy decisions. Goals are being chalked off or penalties denied on the basis of microscopic offside infractions in the buildups that no human has noticed or even appealed for. Surely offside wasn\u2019t so broken that it needed to be fixed like this?\n\n4 The golden boot is still up for grabs\nEnner Valencia has gone home with his Ecuador teammates, but while you wouldn\u2019t back against Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 prospering as France go deeper into the competition, England\u2019s Marcus Rashford, the Netherlands\u2019 Cody Gakpo and Spain\u2019s \u00c1lvaro Morata all have more minutes ahead and tied with Mbapp\u00e9 with three goals.\n\nLionel Messi, Richarlison, Bukayo Saka, Olivier Giroud, Ritsu Doan, Bruno Fernandes, Breel Embolo, Andrej Kramaric and Ferran Torres are also all on two goals with second round matches ahead of them. One hat-trick could swing it.\n5 It has been one of the most well-disciplined group stages ever\nWorld Cups are often marked by flurries of red cards after Fifa gives new refereeing directives \u2013 think the instant red for a tackle from behind that suddenly appeared in 1994, leading to Marco Etcheverry of Bolivia getting his marching orders in the opening match against Germany and being just the first of many. Not this year.\n\nWales goalkeeper Wayne Hennessey was sent off for a high challenge, and Cameroon\u2019s Vincent Aboubakar picked up a second yellow card for taking his shirt off celebrating his winner against Brazil, and that was it for players throughout the whole of the group stages. Admittedly South Korea\u2019s Portuguese head coach, Paulo Bento, also picked up a red card for protesting after the defeat to Ghana, but it was all friendly child\u2019s play compared with the 18 red cards in the group stages in 2006 and the 13 in 2002.\n6 Brazil are always going to be Brazil \u2013 just about\nThey topped their group for the 11th consecutive time. It may have been on goal difference after that unexpected defeat to Cameroon, but 1978 was the last time Brazil failed to win their opening World Cup group. The lesson remains, if you get drawn with Brazil, set your sights on finishing second.\n\n7 Balance of the confederations (slightly) restored after 2018\nUefa nations tend to overperform during European-based World Cups, and in Russia in 2018 \u2013 as it had been in Germany in 2006 \u2013 fully 10 of the 16 slots in the second round were taken by European teams. There\u2019s a greater mix to emerge from the groups this time \u2013 eight European teams, two from South America, one from North America, two from Africa and an unprecedented three from Asia make for a more globally balanced last 16.\n\n8 European teams with star players can\u2019t just turn up and expect to go through\nDenmark, Belgium, Germany and Wales all went into the tournament confident of progressing to the knockout stages, with some of them thinking they even had an outside chance of going far enough to pick up the main prize. All of them turned in a series of lukewarm performances against teams from other confederations that meant despite being the big pre-tournament names, Christian Eriksen, Kevin De Bruyne, Thomas M\u00fcller and Gareth Bale all ended up on early flights home.\n\n9 The spectre of human rights issues remained at Qatar\u2019s feast\nThe constant vacillation of organisers and Fifa on whether captains could wear LGBTQ+ armbands, or if fans could bring in clothing items with rainbows, meant that the issue of Qatar\u2019s human rights record was never out of the picture. Qatar got no consolation on the field. With 12 years to prepare, and a reported $200bn spent for the privilege of hosting, Qatar put in the worst ever World Cup performance by a host nation. Was it worth it?\n\n10 We will never see its like again\nThe 32-team format was introduced for France in 1998, but this year is the last time. For 2026, co-hosts the United States, Mexico and Canada will be welcoming an expanded 48 teams. That means, according to current plans, 16 groups of three. Seeding will ensure the chances of \u201cgroups of death\u201d are slim, and there\u2019s every chance groups could descend into lukewarm final matches where two teams know a draw will suit their purposes and see them both through. There are whispers, however, that Fifa may revisit this decision. Regardless of the format they end up picking, this was the last World Cup group stage as we\u2019ve known it for the past 24 years."

She also has a clause in her contract which commits her to working with Arsenal in the Community to set up a project aimed at young women and girls. \u201cIt\u2019s a tough conversation to have and there\u2019s a lot of dialogue around it,\u201d she said.\n\u201cI will be supporting the men\u2019s team, but I won\u2019t be watching. It\u2019s hard to talk about but at the end of the day, we\u2019re one team here at England and we know that they have an opportunity to play at a World Cup and it\u2019s hard to look beyond that really.\u201d\nResponding to Fifa\u2019s message to teams competing in Qatar to \u201cnot allow football to be dragged into every ideological or political battle that exists\u201d, Wubben-Moy said: \u201cSport is a very strong vehicle for change. To underestimate that would be naive. I\u2019ve seen a lot of the players have strong viewpoints and I salute them, and I wish them the best in looking to express that throughout this World Cup.\n\u201cA lot of the players might not ever play in a World Cup again, so I can\u2019t comment on them choosing to go because many people would take that same choice. But [if] they can use this opportunity to help bring about change, I think that\u2019s important.\u201d\n\nWubben-Moy\u2019s Lionesses teammate Alex Greenwood said: \u201cWe obviously can\u2019t choose where the World Cup is happening. We have to try to change the negative into a positive and speak about the things that we can maybe highlight and what we believe in as a country and that\u2019s for all women to have equal rights. That\u2019s something we\u2019ll talk about openly, and I\u2019m sure the men will do the same.\u201d\nWubben-Moy echoed Greenwood\u2019s sentiments, while Beth Mead told BBC Radio 4 last week that the ban on homosexuality in Qatar was \u201cthe complete opposite to what I believe and respect\u201d.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not something I will be backing or promoting,\u201d said the England forward, who is in a relationship with her Arsenal teammate Vivianne Miedema. \u201cIt\u2019s disappointing in the sense that there\u2019s no respect on a lot of levels, even though it\u2019s a game of football.\u201d"

It\u2019s the hypocritical west, too, 21 November). Saudi Arabia does so too, for example Jamal Khashoggi, who was murdered in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul. Yet Saudi Arabia still gets to host a Formula One grand prix, so-called Clash on the Dunes boxing matches, and international golfing. The 2012 Bahrain grand prix went ahead amid torture and the shooting dead of unarmed protesters. Malik is also right to stress that our governments arm the Gulf states, provide them with surveillance technology, PR, political and diplomatic cover, and \u2013 in a situation where sovereign wealth is often hard to distinguish from private hyper-wealth \u2013 safe havens for blood money. In return for turning a blind eye to grotesque human rights abuses and institutional homophobia and misogyny, \u201cwe\u201d get cheap hydrocarbons, \u201cinward investment\u201d that melds our economy with those of the Gulf states, a regional \u201csecurity\u201d stance and, in the case of Bahrain, a Royal Navy base. Gulf sportswashing has a wider context, and it is a sad reflection on us that human rights abuses only occasionally come to the fore during sporting events, and media debate is so often mired in anti-Arab racism. \u201cWe\u201d are sordidly complicit in these abuses. If the UK\u2019s commitment to human rights is to be meaningful, this has to stop. I speak from experience, having worked on one of Bahrain\u2019s \u201creform\u201d projects, only to have to flee the country because of my advocacy for students\u2019 academic freedoms and human rights.Dr Mike DibollFormer academic head of professional development at Bahrain Teachers \u2022 As a South African born in the 1970s, I can well remember the way that country was rightly shunned by the rest of the world for its racist policies and its brutality in carrying them out. Starting with the Olympics in the 1960s, we were steadily frozen out of international competition. There were, of course, occasions when white South African money talked \u2013 the annual Sun City $1m golf challenge being the most obvious. By and large, however, in the mid-1980s South Africa was a pariah, where only \u201crebel\u201d teams visited, often facing protests on tour and disciplinary action on their return home. For us, politics and sport were inextricably linked, but it was a matter beyond politics: it was a matter of ethics. In western countries, much of the opposition to South African participation was led by the general public, who were often ahead of their governments in condemning the apartheid regime. Thus, in recent decades, I have gone from disappointment to bitter resignation as I repeatedly saw the biggest international sporting events landing in countries run by some of the world\u2019s most brutal regimes. In that context, the backlash about the current Fifa World Cup being held in Qatar gives me some hope that maybe politics \u2013 or, more importantly, ethics \u2013 is coming back into sport. Maybe Fifa has finally bitten off more than the public will swallow. If so, at least something good will come out of this otherwise repugnant spectacle.Karl EklundEdinburgh \u2022 Concerning demonstrations in Qatar, while we would all wish for a greater acceptance of the LGBQT+ community, observance of migrant rights and greater freedoms for women, it ill behoves us to be holier than thou about these difficult matters. As a gay man, it was illegal for me to take part in sexual activity with another man when I was at university, and this only changed within living memory. Indeed, still today many people are scared to come out and homophobia exists in many areas of our daily life. Nor can we be proud if we look at the treatment of the Windrush generation and the discrimination they received on arrival in this country, many of whom have still not received compensation from the Home Office for wrongful attempts to deport them in recent years. And again, we all know of instances of racial discrimination in sport, and the terrible way in which immigrants are still dealt with. As for the way we treat women, once more we have no cause for smugness, with almost daily accounts of appalling behaviour from the police; and though there are many women in high positions in this country, there exist many areas of life where it is still a man\u2019s world such as the legal profession and the entertainment industry. The suffragettes\u2019 campaign for female emancipation is only just beyond present memory and my mother\u2019s generation was largely expected to stay at home to look after the children. So, let\u2019s by all means protest and seek to change other\u2019s views, but we are far from perfect too.Antony BarlowWallington, Surrey \u2022 Mihir Bose expresses exactly my view on the moral dilemma facing those wishing to watch the Qatar World Cup (I hate the very idea of this World Cup in Qatar, but I\u2019ll have to watch: it\u2019s the beautiful game, 19 November). After my first visit to see a Leeds game, I too realised that the game resonated far beyond the field of play. It was like an out-of-body experience. In spite of the corrupt nature of Fifa and its attitude towards human rights \u2013 which must be tackled at source, not during a tournament when it\u2019s too late \u2013 football remains a potent source of hope and belief for millions, much as religion used to be. Bose is right: we will watch the World Cup in the hope that the humanity in the beautiful game outweighs the uglinesses of the path it has taken. We love this game because it is much bigger than cynicism and power politics. We cannot do otherwise.Stan Labovitch Windsor, Berkshire \u2022 Have an opinion on anything you\u2019ve read in the Guardian today?

                    "body": "Restraint is to be urged of police during the World Cup regarding behaviour that goes against the cultural norms of Qatar but is commonplace in Europe, according to a series of secret understandings brokered between Fifa and Qatari officials. Fans should be allowed to climb on tables, drape flags over statues and sing loud songs in public without facing interventions by police, according to a summary of the agreements seen by the Guardian. Essential areas of individual rights are also covered, with LGBTQ+ fans to be allowed to show displays of affection in the street and fly rainbow flags in public places, despite laws that mean homosexuality is illegal in the Gulf state.  With the opening match of the World Cup just over two weeks away, fans and football associations continue to face uncertainty over how supporters will be treated in Qatar. This is especially true of policing, much of which will be subcontracted by Qatar to Turkish and Pakistani law enforcement. This week British police said they would be taking 15 \u201csupporter engagement officers\u201d to the tournament to help avoid cultural misunderstandings. But unpublished results of discussions between Fifa and representatives of the Qatari Safety and Security Operations Committee (SSOC) shows there are a number of areas in which police will be expected to show \u201cleniency towards behaviours that do not threaten physical integrity or property\u201d. In a section headlined \u201cfans\u201d, the document lays out instances in which police should not intervene in specific detail. \u201cStanding on a table/chair/bench and chanting a fan song in public: no action, no prosecution,\u201d reads one entry. \u201cCovering sculptures, etc. with fan flags and banners in public: no action, no prosecution,\u201d is another. The document is understood to be a distillation of a lengthy meeting in which Fifa officials sought to obtain firm answers on how policing might be conducted during the tournament. Some elements emphasise the wide gap between western expectations of the law and the norms in Qatar. One section, marked \u201cwomen\u2019s rights\u201d, states: \u201cWomen will be able to receive medical care including related to pregnancy or reproductive health regardless of the circumstances and will not face any accusations.\u201d This statement is likely a response to laws that mean consenting sex outside of marriage remains illegal in Qatar. The document goes on to say: \u201cWomen will not face any accusations if they report rape or sexual harassment/violence\u201d. Qataris have come under intense pressure to ensure the safety of LGBTQ+ people travelling to the tournament. The document makes no mention of the possibility of amending the penal code, one demand made of the World Cup hosts, but under a section marked \u201cpublic norms\u201d it says: \u201cVisitors can stay in the same room regardless of marital status or gender.\u201d On the issue of protest around LGBTQ+ rights, the document says: \u201cPersons displaying the rainbow or other sexual identity flags will neither be approached, detained nor prosecuted.\u201d It also confirms that people should be allowed to kiss and hold hands in public places or in stadiums without interference. A lack of public commitment from the hosts to greater tolerance for the duration of the tournament has caused concerns to rise among supporters intending to travel as well as those in marginalised groups. The latest news comes after it was revealed that hundreds of fans will be travelling to the tournament at the expense of Qatari authorities who, in return, will ask that individuals do not make critical remarks in public about the tournament. Fifa would not comment on the document when approached by the Guardian, and a statement provided by the Supreme Committee in charge of implementing the World Cup said: \u201cWe are aware of a Fifa World Cup Qatar 2022 document regarding fan behaviour circulating on social media. This document was not developed or approved by the SC or any other State of Qatar entity.\u201d"

Members of the Fan Leader Network, a group which Qatari authorities say \u201ccontributes to tournament planning through fan insight, research, content creation and message amplification\u201d, have been offered the once-in-a-lifetime opportunity of travelling to the tournament, providing they agree to certain terms and conditions.  A number of England and Wales fans have signed up to the deal, which includes paid-for flights and accommodation but necessitates a minimum 14-day stay and attending \u201cselected and scheduled\u201d events. One will be the opening ceremony on Sunday 20 November, during which fan leaders will feature in short sections of the TV coverage. \u201cIdeally we hope that you will stay for the entire duration of the 29 day tournament,\u201d organisers told potential travellers. The Times has reported that 40 England fans and 40 Wales fans have agreed to take up the offer. According to the terms and conditions of a deal initially revealed by the Dutch broadcaster NOS, travellers will in effect be asked to promote the tournament and the experience as part of the trip. Key to the deal will be the \u201c\u2018liking\u2019 and re-sharing third-party posts\u201d, while fans have also reportedly been asked to flag social media content that is critical of the event. The conditions asked of fans are similar to those that might be asked of a social media influencer before undertaking paid promotion. But the terms have not put off some supporters, with fan representatives from all 32 countries expected to accept the offer of free hospitality at a tournament expected to be twice as expensive as the 2018 World Cup in Russia. With the countdown to the tournament firmly under way, the president of Fifa, Gianni Infantino, has co-authored a letter with the general secretary, Fatma Samoura, calling on all 32 competing countries to put concerns over the host country to one side and \u201clet football take the stage\u201d. Infantino did not address concerns over Qatari human rights, for example, writing instead that while \u201cthere are many challenges and difficulties of a political nature all around the world\u201d, football should not be expected to have an answer to every one. He repeated his promise that \u201ceveryone is welcome [at the World Cup] regardless of origin, background, religion, gender, sexual orientation or nationality\u201d, a more detailed commitment than that currently made by the hosts."

                    "body": "The Qatar World Cup took another strange twist on Tuesday with the capacity of its eight stadiums officially growing by 12%.\nOvernight the Al Bayt Stadium, which hosted the opening game, went from 60,000 in the pre-tournament guide to 68,895 on the official website \u2013 while the biggest stadium, the Lusail, went from 80,000 to 88,966. It came after fans were left confused by attendances breaching stadium capacity in every game.\n\nA source close to the organisers insisted the original numbers reflected Fifa\u2019s requirements for stadiums to have a minimum of 80,000, 60,000 and 40,000 capacities. The Qataris have since found that the number of seats they needed for broadcast, media and sponsorship purposes was less than expected, hence the capacity increases.\nThe source added that the Lusail can seat 92,000 before broadcast and media requirements. Overall the combined capacities listed on Qatar\u2019s World Cup site increased from a combined 380,000 to 426,221 on Tuesday.\nA second mystery remains, however: why there seem to be a lot more empty seats than are claimed in the official attendance figures. Official figures suggest that over 88,000 people watched Saudi Arabia shock Argentina at the Lusail Stadium on Tuesday \u2013 less than a thousand shy of capacity \u2013 but pockets of available seating were visible across the venue.\nThe first and most likely explanation is ticket holders not showing up. The biggest gaps at all matches \u2013 especially the visibly under-attended Senegal v the Netherlands match on Monday \u2013 are those in the most expensive seats that run down the side of the pitch in the first two tiers. This could mean sponsors or invited guests have chosen not to attend.\nIt could also be that tickets are held by local fans who are unable to make the match. Although Fifa has confirmed that Qatar is among the nations to have bought the greatest share of the 3m available tickets, not surprising for a host nation, the precise number sold has not been published.\nThis week the Guardian met one Qatari fan who said he had tickets for 20 matches. These were bought using two separate Fifa accounts, an unauthorised practice, and he said the majority of his friends had done similar. Finally it is possible that foreign visitors, who bought tickets in the original ballot, have chosen not to travel.\nOne further possible explanation is the system used on the ground to sell tickets that have been returned or not sold. A central office at the DECC metro station in the West Bay of Doha offers constant access to available match tickets. But the sales system does not always show every match for sale, with most fixtures appearing to be sold out until the digital displays refreshes to show new options.\n\nOther possible factors include problems with the digital ticketing systems, with \u201cticket resolution\u201d centres the site of substantial queues in the run-up to both the Saudi and England matches.\nIt is certainly the case, however, that organisers have talked up the number of people coming to the tournament \u2013 with Fifa\u2019s president, Gianni Infantino, saying on Friday: \u201cThree million people will be in the stands watching.\u201d That claim is not always matching up to the eye test.\n\u2022 This article was amended on 23 November 2022. The main picture caption said that the capacity at the Lusail Stadium had gone from 60,000 to 68,895. This should have been 80,000 to 88,966."

Same-sex relationships are illegal in Qatar, while thousands of workers are alleged to have died during the construction of the tournament stadiums and infrastructure.\n\n\u201cThe World Cup shouldn\u2019t be here.

The issue came to a head on Monday when seven countries that had planned for their captains to wear the armbands in Qatar, to champion inclusivity, backed down when faced with the threat of sporting sanctions from Fifa.\nThe BBC pundit Alex Scott wore the OneLove armband during the BBC\u2019s coverage of England\u2019s opening win against Iran in solidarity with LGBTQ+ people.\n\u201cI think it\u2019s great that it\u2019s been brought up,\u201d Keane added. \u201cThey shouldn\u2019t have the World Cup here. You can\u2019t treat people like that. We all love football, we love soccer, we\u2019re on about spreading the game. Just to dismiss human rights flippantly because of a football tournament \u2026 it\u2019s not right.\n\u201cThe bottom line is, we are talking about common decency, how you treat people. Football, the greatest sport in the world, there is so much money involved, there will be corruption but let\u2019s get back to basics, you have to treat people with decency. It should start and finish with that.\u201d"

It started yesterday with an opening ceremony featuring Morgan Freeman and Jungkook from K-pop superstars BTS, and a 2-0 defeat for Qatar against Ecuador. Meanwhile this weekend, Fifa president Gianni Infantino, paid about \u00a32.6m this year, said, among other preposterous things, that he feels \u201clike a migrant worker\u201d. And Pete Pattisson reported for the Guardian that some actual migrant workers employed as security guards during the tournament appear to be being paid as little as 35 pence an hour. Guardian sportswriters covering the tournament are feeling this weirdness more acutely than most: they\u2019re in Qatar, writing match reports, assessing full-backs and substitutions, while at the same time trying to reflect the concerns over allegations of human rights abuses, corruption, and modern slavery. In today\u2019s newsletter, we hear from three of them \u2013 Jonathan Liew, Paul MacInnes, and Barney Ronay \u2013 about how the tournament looks up close, and what it tells us about football\u2019s troubling power. Here are the headlines. Five big stories  Cop27 | The world still stands \u201con the brink of climate catastrophe\u201d after the deal reached at the Cop27 UN climate summit on Sunday, and the biggest economies must make fresh commitments to cut greenhouse gas emissions, climate experts and campaigners have warned. Read Fiona Harvey\u2019s account of a negotiation session that continued for 40 hours after its Friday deadline. Brexit | The government has sought to quell a backlash among hardline Brexiters after it was claimed the UK wanted to pursue closer ties with the European Union by adopting a Swiss-style relationship. Health secretary Steve Barclay said: \u201cI don\u2019t recognise this story at all.\u201d Rail transport | Rail cancellations have reached their highest level on record with more than 314,000 trains fully or partly cancelled across Great Britain in a year, a Guardian analysis has revealed. Conservatives | A Conservative councillor photographed wearing a blackshirt and surrounded by fascist imagery at far-right events has been suspended from the party. Andy Weatherhead, said by anti-racist organisation Hope Not Hate to have been a senior member of the openly fascist New British Union, said he attended two events in 2013 \u201cin the spirit of education and curiosity\u201d. Qatar World Cup | The comedian Joe Lycett appears to have thrown \u00a310,000 into an industrial shredder in protest at David Beckham\u2019s continued support for the World Cup in Qatar. In a video posted online yesterday, Lycett \u2013 dressed in rainbow feathers \u2013 put what appeared to be bundles of cash into a shredder before cursteying to camera.  In depth: \u2018You want a World Cup? This is what a World Cup is\u2019  Barney Ronay I\u2019m speaking to you from the McCafe at the Doha main media centre. It\u2019s vast \u2013 it\u2019s an enormous convention centre, one of those places where the corridors have travelators because it\u2019s so massive. Everything is clean, hard surfaces and air conditioning. Paul MacInnes We\u2019re staying in a non-descript apartment block bedecked with international flags. It looks like every single member of the international press is here. One of them has apparently brought a Christmas tree to put in his room. I arrived to an email warning that the quality of the bedsheets was very poor, and we\u2019d be reimbursed if we had to replace them, but they\u2019re pretty much exactly the same as the ones I have at home, so make of that what you will \u2026 *** The atmosphere: \u2018It feels like a theme park\u2019 Jonathan Liew The reversal on beer in stadiums made it quite clear that Fifa are on the verge of losing control of their own tournament. It\u2019s quite funny, in a way: it couldn\u2019t happen to a nicer organisation! But it\u2019s pretty remarkable that they are only just now realising what it means to be giving their premier tournament to a state without much interest in due process or consistency. And Fifa are over a barrel. It\u2019s not just about beer in stadiums. If security are going to be heavy-handed, say, there\u2019s not much Fifa can realistically do. PM It doesn\u2019t quite feel like the World Cup is happening. When I got off the plane, I saw some fans from Cameroon who were ten minutes behind on the escalator, singing songs and banging tambourines, but it was 50, not 500, and they\u2019re the only people I\u2019ve seen. When I walked through the centre of town, the advertising was ubiquitous, and every single local appears to be wearing a football shirt or engaged in some way. But I haven\u2019t seen large numbers of fans. I wrote a piece noting that this tournament is going to be a lot more corralled and centralised than previously \u2013 staying in official places, watching official entertainment. Read Paul MacInnes on what fans visiting Qatar for the World Cup can expect BR The fan village is not in the centre of the city. It\u2019s a place to go and look at people, essentially \u2013 a concrete plaza with a very limited supply of Budweiser as a sop to the beer drinking masses. Most of the travelling England fans will be expats, or people with enough money to make a trip \u2013 I don\u2019t think the \u201cplease don\u2019t take me home\u201d lads are going to make much of an impression. PM You hear about people who are going to stay in Dubai and go back after the game. We will see a very middle and upper class tournament \u2013 a change in the demographic. But then everything about the game in England at the top level is about a global audience, and how it looks on TV is more important than the live experience. These fan parks, which look like the opposite experience of previous World Cups \u2013 getting to know a place, being part of it for a while \u2013 are a deliberate strategy by Fifa. It wants to turn the tournament into a festival, where going to a match is just a part of it. A homogenised experience that\u2019s the same wherever you stage it in the world. BR It feels like a theme park. There\u2019s always been this ridiculous corporate circus, but generally it intersects with a real sense of joy, and you monetise the joy. Here, there\u2019s no joy, just monetising. You feel that this is a place that should in no world be staging this, until you realise: the World Cup is not a festival of football, it\u2019s a travelling city state, a TV show sold to people who can pay the most money. You want a World Cup? This is what a World Cup is. Read Barney Ronay on Fifa president Fianni Infantino\u2019s \u2018Football Jesus\u2019 act in his press conference in Doha *** The history: \u2018Fifa has always used spreading the game as cover for financial gain\u2019  BR People love football in this part of the world, and it is the world game. How unusual is what\u2019s happened here? Fifa, since its earliest days, has always used the idea of spreading the game as cover for financial gain. In 1978 it was in Argentina, hosted by a vicious fascist dictatorship that was machine-gunning people. Joao Havelange [then Fifa president] said it was about spreading the game. I don\u2019t believe that for a second. PM If you look back on previous World Cups, it\u2019s surprising how many of them came with ethical concerns which weren\u2019t as prominently in the spotlight as Qatar \u2013 even in Russia in 2018, the main concerns were hooliganism, but Putin was already involved in an illegal war and the longterm suppression of human rights and his political opponents. So I understand an element of the Qatari pushback which asks: why are we the ones? On the other hand, when questions have been raised, there haven\u2019t been very good answers. JL In Russia, they put their best face on to the world. Everyone was extremely nice and polite and welcoming in a way that felt extremely strategic. It didn\u2019t feel like an oppressive place, but occasionally these things will slip through. I remember working in a cafe in Moscow, tapping away on a piece, opposite military police headquarters, and these two guys in uniform a few tables away called me over and said \u2018have a drink with us\u2019, and spent a couple of hours asking extremely personal questions and filling my glass to the brim and teaching me a load of Russian toasts \u2026 I wasn\u2019t quite sure what sort of situation it was. I filed the piece in an extremely groggy state. But it made me think about how power can be exerted without really exerting itself. That\u2019s what it\u2019s going to be like in Qatar. *** The coverage: \u2018There is always going to be this cognitive dissonance\u2019 JL World Cups are always heavily channelled through official routes, and official lines of inquiry. But even though we\u2019re there for the football there is a duty to report on the whole of the tournament and what it means for the country, what its impact is, and who\u2019s suffering. PM Getting responses from the authorities is difficult, and that goes for Fifa as well as Qatar. We already know about photographers being told to stop taking pictures, or asked to delete images, and restrictions on taking photos of government buildings. BR You have to keep both plates spinning. Some people might say it\u2019s stupid talking about football when we\u2019re also talking about the deaths of workers, rights abuses \u2013 but you have to not give up on the game, because otherwise you\u2019re saying, \u201cyep \u2013 it does belong to you, the people who have decided it\u2019s something to be sold and retailed. It\u2019s all yours.\u201d And I don\u2019t think we should do that. JL If you work out how to do both things, please let me know. You acknowledge the incredible injustices of this tournament, and there\u2019s a slightly awkward pause, and then you ask, so who\u2019s going to win? That\u2019s always been the case, but it\u2019s even more dissonant here. Read Jonathan Liew on the \u2018horrifying but irresistible prospect\u2019 of Qatar 2022 I totally respect people who have concluded that they just can\u2019t have anything to do with this tournament at all. My view is that it is part of football, and you cover it if you cover football. I don\u2019t want these old guys dictating how I feel about it. The contract may belong to them, but the game still belongs to me. *** The legacy: \u2018It\u2019s not about sportswashing. It\u2019s about hard power\u2019  PM I\u2019m writing something at the moment about workers\u2019 rights, and trying to focus on what the World Cup can deliver in terms of permanent change, and the answer looks like being: not much. A lot of people have been trying behind closed doors and now they are throwing their hands up and saying, \u201cno, it\u2019s not worked\u201d. So that is going to be an indictment of hosting the tournament here. BR \u201cSportswashing\u201d is a term that was invented about seven years ago, and I\u2019m not really sure it does the job. It\u2019s about hard power. A friend of mine spoke to some senior Qatari people, and he asked, what do you want the tournament for? You have one of the world\u2019s highest GDPs per capita. And the response was: we don\u2019t want to be another Kuwait. It\u2019s a tiny peninsula surrounded by Saudi Arabia, it\u2019s vulnerable, there have been coups in the past \u2013 well, nobody is invading Qatar now. It\u2019s a player on the stage.  JL Football went through a slightly idealistic phase about a decade ago, maybe, where it was very convinced of its ability to do good. I think now we are all reconciled to the fact that it is a tool in a world of unbridled power. --- For all the latest on Qatar, from the scandal to the scores, sign up to Football Daily \u2013 our free, sometimes funny, newsletter.

Archie If there\u2019s one tiny upside to holding a World Cup in a small nation where human rights abuses are common and homosexuality is illegal, it\u2019s the light that can be shone on it.

                    "body": "Jojo Wollacott (Ghana)\nGhana arrive at the World Cup as the lowest-ranked team in the competition and with an acute goalkeeping crisis on their hands. Their first choice, Charlton\u2019s Wollacott, was a late omission after suffering a finger injury in the warm-up to Saturday\u2019s League One game at Burton. With Richard Ofori, the second choice, also sidelined, the head coach, Otto Addo, has been forced to draft in three inexperienced keepers to the squad.\nReece James (England)\nThe Chelsea defender described himself as \u201cdevastated\u201d after failing to convince Gareth Southgate that he was a risk worth taking. James was ruled out for eight weeks after damaging knee ligaments against Milan in October and underwent a gruelling rehabilitation programme in an attempt to be fit. He did not succeed, and is arguably England\u2019s biggest loss.\n\nMiles Robinson (USA)\nThe Atlanta United defender played a key role in the qualifying campaign, building on his success at the 2021 Concacaf Gold Cup when he scored the winner in the final against Mexico, only to rupture his left achilles tendon against Chicago Fire in May. The 25-year-old underwent surgery and is not expected to return until next year.\nPresnel Kimpembe (France)\nThe French Football Federation hailed \u201cthe honesty of Presnel\u201d after the Paris Saint-Germain defender informed Didier Deschamps on Monday that he did not feel sufficiently recovered from a hamstring injury to help the team\u2019s title defence. The 27-year-old was one of the few French World Cup-winners to maintain his level at last summer\u2019s European Championship. His place has been taken by the uncapped Monaco defender Axel Disasi.\n\nBen Chilwell (England)\nSouthgate has gone from having a feast of right-backs to a famine on the left after the hamstring injury that Chilwell sustained against Dinamo Zagreb earlier this month increased his reliance on Luke Shaw staying fit and in-form during the tournament. Chilwell did not make an appearance for England at Euro 2020 but was showing signs of returning to form following an ACL injury when his latest setback occurred.\nPaul Pogba (France)\nPogba certainly lived up to the hype at the last World Cup when, unrecognisable from his Manchester United days, the midfielder was instrumental in France\u2019s triumph on and off the pitch. There will be no repeat four years on, however. The 29-year-old has not featured for Juventus since returning to the club in the summer having undergone surgery to repair a torn meniscus suffered in pre-season. He then damaged a thigh muscle in training.\n\nN\u2019Golo Kant\u00e9 (France)\nDidier Deschamps will be without both of the central midfielders who started France\u2019s World Cup final win over Croatia four years ago as Kant\u00e9 is sidelined by a hamstring injury. The 31-year-old suffered the problem in August before joining Chelsea\u2019s list of World Cup absentees when relapsing, and going under the knife, in October. None of the six midfielders in Deschamps\u2019 squad were involved in Russia.\nGiovani Lo Celso (Argentina)\nTottenham fans may not have witnessed the best of Lo Celso but he has been an important part of Lionel Scaloni\u2019s plans in recent seasons and is a big miss for Argentina in Qatar. The on-loan Villarreal midfielder suffered a muscle tear against Athletic Bilbao last month and is expected to need surgery. Scaloni said Lo Celso was \u201cirreplaceable\u201d.\nMarco Reus (Germany)\nThe luckless Borussia Dortmund favourite has been here several times before. When the 33-year-old was taken off on a stretcher with a serious ankle injury during September\u2019s derby against Schalke there was despair and resignation around Signal Iduna Park. Reus missed Germany\u2019s victorious 2014 World Cup campaign with an ankle injury, missed Euro 2016 with a groin problem, played in the poor World Cup defence of 2018 and missed Euro 2020 with fatigue. The derby injury makes it four tournament absences out of five.\n\nDiogo Jota (Portugal)\n\u201cOne of my dreams collapsed,\u201d posted the Liverpool forward after a calf injury sustained in the closing minutes of October\u2019s win against Manchester City shattered his World Cup ambitions. Jota had not long returned to the Liverpool side after a hamstring problem and is unlikely to be fit when the Premier League season resumes on Boxing Day. His absence, along with that of Wolves\u2019 Pedro Neto, leaves Portugal more reliant than usual on Cristiano Ronaldo.\nTimo Werner (Germany)\nPlaying more regularly in order to secure a place at the World Cup was one of the reasons Werner returned to RB Leipzig from Chelsea in the summer. The striker made an encouraging start, with nine goals in all competitions, only for an ankle ligament injury sustained the week before Hansi Flick announced his squad to derail those best-laid plans. Werder Bremen\u2019s in-form Niclas F\u00fcllkrug has been called up instead."

Kids will be at school, people will be working and the timings will not be the best for people to watch the games.\u201d  Fernandes is a key part of the Portugal side that will begin its campaign against Ghana a week on Thursday. \u201cWe know the surroundings of the World Cup,\u201d he went on, \u201cwhat has been in the past few weeks, past few months, about the people that have died on the construction of the stadiums. We are not happy about that at all. \u201cWe want football to be for everyone, everyone has to be included and involved in a World Cup because a World Cup is the world. It\u2019s for everyone, it doesn\u2019t matter who. But for a World Cup it\u2019s more than football, it\u2019s a party for fans, players, something that\u2019s a joy to watch, should be done in a better way.\u201d United won the game with an injury-time winner from the 18-year-old Argentinian Alejandro Garnacho. \u201cHe has a lot of talent and his work rate together with the talent makes a big difference with us from the bench,\u201d Fernandes said.  Even that, though, was overshadowed by the World Cup and what the United manager, Erik ten Hag, described as the \u201cdanger\u201d of \u201cfour weeks, no games, lose focus\u201d. Marco Silva was frustrated to see his Fulham side concede a decisive injury-time goal in successive games, after Manchester City\u2019s winner last weekend.  \u201cIt\u2019s tough to take,\u201d the manager said. \u201cWe deserved much more from the game.

Issuing the challenge, the comedian said he would donate the money to charity if Beckham agreed to cut ties with the World Cup host, but if not, the footballer\u2019s \u201cstatus as a gay icon will be shredded\u201d along with the cash in a livestream next Sunday before the opening ceremony. Beckham, who has historically supported gay fans and players, will earn as much as \u00a3150m as an ambassador for the Qatar World Cup, despite the country outlawing same-sex relationships and concerns over its record on human rights. The charity Human Rights Watch found as recently as September this year, queer people were being detained without charge \u2013 in one case for two months in solitary confinement \u2013 and violently and sexually assaulted, under \u201cmorality\u201d laws.  In a video posted on social media and the website benderslikebeckham.com, Lycett opens by saying: \u201cThis is a message to David Beckham. I consider you, along with Kim Woodburn and Monty Don, to be a gay icon. You were the first premiership footballer to do shoots with gay magazines like Attitude, to speak openly about your gay fans, and you married a Spice Girl which is the gayest thing a human being can do.\u201d He turned to Beckham\u2019s deal with Qatar \u2013 \u201cone of the worst places in the world to be gay\u201d \u2013 to promote the World Cup. He said: \u201cIf you end your relationship with Qatar I will donate 10 grand of my own money to charities that support queer people in football. \u201cHowever, if you do not I will throw the money into a shredder at midday next Sunday, just before the opening ceremony of the World Cup and stream it right here. Not just the money, but also your status as a gay icon will be shredded.\u201d Beckham has already been criticised by fans, including Di Cunningham, the co-founder of the Three Lions Pride, the England national team\u2019s biggest LGBTQ+ supporters\u2019 group. She said: \u201cI\u2019m just so disappointed because we \u2013 the LGBTQ+ football family \u2013 have put David Beckham on a pedestal, as a great ally. \u201cAnd then it turns out that he\u2019s taking a lot of money to be an ambassador for this World Cup, and that\u2019s incredibly disappointing.\u201d"

Same-sex relationships are illegal in Qatar, and the host nation has been the subject of criticism for its LGBTQ policies as the World Cup approaches. The design features seven rainbow-colored vertical stripes below \u201cUSA\u201d in dark blue letters and is part of the \u201cBe The Change\u201d initiative the team adopted in 2020 with the goal of inspiring action on social justice issues.  \u201cWhen we are on the world stage and when we are in a venue like Qatar, it is important to bring awareness to these issues and that is what \u2018Be the Change\u2019 is about,\u201d US coach Gregg Berhalter told a news conference on Monday. \u201cIt is not just Stateside that we want to bring attention to social issues, it is also abroad. We recognise that Qatar has made strides and there has been a ton of progress but there\u2019s some work still to do.\u201d Organisers of the World Cup, which is the first to be held in a Middle Eastern nation, say that everyone, no matter their sexual orientation or background, is welcome, while also warning against public displays of affection. Some players have raised concerns over the rights of fans travelling to this year\u2019s World Cup, especially LGBTQ individuals and women, whom rights groups say Qatari laws discriminate against. \u201cWe are a group who believes in inclusivity and we will continue to project that message going forward,\u201d said US goalkeeper Sean Johnson. \u201cWe have chatted and continue to have discussions as we lead into the games. We have leaned on the message of \u2018Be the Change\u2019. That is something that we have been proud of and continue to work towards, be impactful with ourselves, our presence and our platform, and we will continue to be so here in Qatar.\u201d The rainbow badge, which will not be worn by the team during World Cup games, has been routinely displayed by US Soccer as a way to promote a spirit of inclusivity. \u201cOur rainbow badge has an important and consistent role in the identity of US Soccer,\u201d US Soccer spokesman Neil Buethe told Reuters. \u201cAs part of our approach for any match or event, we include rainbow branding to support and embrace the LGBTQ community, as well as to promote a spirit of inclusiveness and welcoming to all fans across the globe. \u201cAs a result, locations that we will manage and operate at the Fifa World Cup, such as the team hotel, media areas and parties, will feature both traditional and rainbow US Soccer branding.\u201d Meanwhile, Fulham defender Tim Ream and Arsenal goalkeeper Matt Turner are among the US players to receive well-wishes from fictional coach Ted Lasso.  Giant yellow banners began to appear in the home towns of the US players this week, each with a personalised message from Jason Sudeikis\u2019 TV character.

                    "body": "He has the clout to summon Tony Blair to Claridge\u2019s for late-night business negotiations, helped engineer the downfall of the Libyan despot Muammar Gaddafi and orchestrated his tiny desert country\u2019s successful bid to host the World Cup. But until this year, Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim bin Jaber al-Thani, Qatar\u2019s former prime minister turned billionaire investor, might have escaped many people\u2019s notice. In June 2022, it was claimed that the Prince of Wales, now King Charles III, had accepted \u20ac3m in bags full of cash between 2011 and 2015 \u2013 donations to his charity, from the man known variously as HBJ and \u201cthe man who bought London\u201d. The report, by the Sunday Times, threw a spotlight on a 63-year-old whose remarkable network of political and business connections is evidence of guile and staying power amid political turmoil. He not only survived the 1995 bloodless coup against the regime he had served but remained at the heart of Qatari domestic and foreign policy, as the tiny emirate \u2013 whose citizen population is akin to that of Coventry \u2013 thrust itself on to the world stage. His links to the UK go back decades and have not been without controversy. Thani was foreign minister in 1996, when Qatar signed a \u00a3500m arms contract with the British defence company BAE Systems. It later emerged that the deal involved the transfer of \u00a37m into two Jersey trusts that he owned. When the Jersey authorities launched an investigation into the payments, according to reports by the Observer, the British government warned them to back off or risk harming UK-Qatari relations. Thani ended up paying the Jersey authorities \u00a36m voluntarily, without admitting any wrongdoing. Blair\u2019s government denied reports that it put pressure on Jersey officials to drop the case. Blair and Thani would go on to develop a close working relationship. Between 2004 and 2009, a period during which Thani graduated from foreign minister to prime minister, Qatar\u2019s Al Udeid airbase became a staging post for US and UK military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. After Blair was succeeded by Gordon Brown in 2007, Thani would play a critical role in British financial stability too. Qatar invested in Barclays during the financial crisis in 2008, when Thani was prime minister, sparing the government the expense of bailing out the bank, as it had to with Royal Bank of Scotland, Lloyds and Halifax Bank of Scotland. Thani\u2019s personal investment vehicle, Challenger, took a stake in the bank too. Three former Barclays executives were later accused of devising fraudulent advisory services agreements to disguise payments worth \u00a3322m to Qatar in exchange for the investment. They were found not guilty in February 2020 and there was no suggestion of any wrongdoing by Thani or Qatar. Barclays is now appealing against a regulatory fine over the deal. With the globally influential Thani at the helm, the emirate became a pivotal player in political upheaval in the Gulf. Qatar backed efforts to depose Gaddafi and supported the Arab spring uprisings, including through the state-owned news channel Al Jazeera. Thani also allegedly conceded that under his premiership Qatar \u201cmaybe\u201d financed the al- Nusra Front, the Syrian branch of al-Qaida, without his knowledge. Before leaving office, he was reunited with Blair in 2012, when a weary group of bankers and executives reached an impasse over the proposed \u00a350bn merger of the mining firms Glencore and Xstrata. The former British PM was called to late-night talks at Claridge\u2019s hotel in Mayfair to help broker a deal with Thani, who controlled Qatar\u2019s stake in Xstrata and was demanding improved terms on the deal. Blair broke the deadlock and reportedly walked away with an advisory fee of up to $1m from the negotiating parties for a few hours\u2019 work. The incident epitomised what one person who has done business with Thani described as a relentless will to win, deploying his unrivalled connections to achieve his goals. It also showed that he could pull strings in the highest places to leverage his country\u2019s vast gas riches. Not only did he preside over Qatar\u2019s controversial bid to host the 2022 World Cup, but he masterminded the purchase of prestige assets such as Harrods, the Shard and stakes in blue-chip companies such as the London Stock Exchange and the British Airways owner IAG. Although he stepped down in 2013, his personal business dealings have run in parallel with those of the Qatari state. He has amassed a valuable portfolio of London property and hotels \u2013 useful for a man who reportedly has two wives and 15 children. The network of British business interests is run from 67 Brook Street, a Mayfair address that was once home to the Bee Gees. The flagship of his portfolio is the Maybourne Hotel Group, including Claridge\u2019s and the Connaught, which he owns in partnership with the former emir Hamad bin Khalifa al-Thani, his friend and ally. In 2021, he also bought a \u00a3200m stake in Richard Caring\u2019s Caprice Holdings, which includes the Ivy and Sexy Fish restaurants, and the private members\u2019 club Annabel\u2019s. His London residential property includes Forbes House, a mansion he is said to be developing into the capital\u2019s first \u00a3300m home and a triplex apartment at the One Hyde Park development that he financed in partnership with the Candy brothers. Both are owned via offshore companies, Land Registry records suggest. His interests outside the UK include a stake in Deutsche Bank and extensive business interests in Qatar. Khalifa famously said that while he ran Qatar, Thani owned it. At times, it has been unclear whether Thani is a businessman, a diplomat, or a mixture of the two. In 2014, he bought an 80% stake in Heritage Oil, despite being listed as a \u201ccounsellor\u201d at the Qatari embassy. In theory, diplomats are prohibited from commercial dealings for personal profit but his lawyers argued the purchase did not constitute ongoing trade activity. Two years later, the UK high court ruled he could not be sued in London over claims that agents acting on his behalf falsely imprisoned and tortured a British citizen who claimed that his land, in Qatar, had been wrongfully seized. Thani invoked diplomatic immunity but also denied the claims. \u201cMr al-Attiya\u2019s extremely serious allegations are, without exception, a combination of distortion, exaggeration and wholesale fabrication,\u201d his lawyers said. According to the Panama Papers leak of offshore secrets, Thani used a shell company to the 133-metre Al Mirqab yacht in 2002. The vessel, worth $300m, reportedly has a helicopter landing pad, Jacuzzi, cinema, gym and spa. In May 2015, he bought Picasso\u2019s Les Femmes d\u2019Alger (Version O) for $179.4m including fees, then a record price for a painting at auction. The Guardian has approached him for comment."

                    "body": "When Nasser al-Khater, Qatar\u2019s World Cup chief, was asked two weeks ago about the recent death of a migrant worker, his response was both shocking and revealing. \u201cWe\u2019re in the middle of a World Cup and we have a successful World Cup. And this is something you want to talk about right now? I mean death is a natural part of life,\u201d he said, before going on to offer condolences to the family of the deceased. First, a sense of outrage and indignation that anyone would challenge Qatar\u2019s narrative about the World Cup and then a callous indifference for the workers who made it possible. In recent weeks, that outrage, stoked by the Qatari authorities, has been seen in numerous articles calling western criticism of Qatar\u2019s human rights record racist, hypocritical and orientalist. Most chillingly, we have seen Qatar\u2019s talking points repeated by Eva Kaili \u2013 at the time a vice-president of the European parliament \u2013 who was charged along with three others last week, in connection with allegations that Qatar used gifts and cash to influence decision-making. Kaili and Qatar deny any wrongdoing. \u201cThe World Cup in Qatar is proof, actually, of how sports diplomacy can achieve a historic transformation of a country \u2026 [the International Labour Organization] said that Qatar is a frontrunner in labour rights,\u201d said Kaili in a debate on the country\u2019s human rights record the day after the World Cup kicked off. \u201cStill some here are calling to discriminate them, they bully them and they accuse everyone that talks to them or engages of corruption.\u201d And yet it is the second part of Khater\u2019s response that explains much of the criticism. The casual dismissal of a worker\u2019s death illustrates what I have seen time and again in almost a decade of reporting on the treatment of Qatar\u2019s low-wage migrant workers \u2013 that for the most part, the Qatari authorities just don\u2019t appear to care. The real scandal of this World Cup is not that the criticism of Qatar is racially motivated, but that the men who built this tournament have been subjected to a labour system based largely on racial discrimination. That was clear to the former UN special rapporteur on racism, Tendayi Achiume, who in 2020 released a damning report highlighting \u201cserious concerns of structural racial discrimination against non-nationals\u201d. Achiume said a \u201cde facto caste system based on national origin\u201d exists in Qatar, \u201caccording to which European, North American, Australian and Arab nationalities systematically enjoy greater human rights protections than south Asian and sub-Saharan African nationalities\u201d.  This discrimination is embedded in \u201cfamily housing only\u201d zoning regulations that effectively prohibit most migrant workers from living in certain parts of the country and has played out for all to see when low-wage workers have been barred from entering some parks, shopping malls and public spaces. It is evident in the different wages paid to different nationalities \u2013 Nepalis and Bangladeshis are often paid less than Indians or Filipinos for doing the same work, for example. A recent report by human rights group Equidem found that almost half the workers interviewed who were employed on World Cup stadiums reported nationality-based discrimination. And it is most obvious simply in the way low-wage workers are treated. Twelve years after Qatar won the bid to host the World Cup, tens of thousands of workers remain housed in appalling accommodation and are still forced to pay extortionate recruitment fees for their jobs, often in return for a basic wage that equates to just \u00a31 an hour.  Wage theft appears rampant and arguably got worse in the months leading up to the World Cup, when thousands of workers were sent home, many still in debt, as companies wrapped up construction projects. The Qatari government has said it has taken wide-ranging actions to create safe conditions for its migrant workers and regulations have been put in place to limit labourers\u2019 exposuer to the searing summer heat. But the authorities have done little to investigate the deaths of thousands of migrant workers, and countless families have been left without answers or compensation from their loved ones\u2019 employers. As Nirmala Pakrin, the widow of a worker who died while employed on a World Cup stadium, said to me recently: \u201cThey are making millions \u2026 [so] why can\u2019t they even give us a little compensation?\u201d Geoffrey Otieno, a Kenyan worker who was detained in Qatar for speaking out on workers\u2019 rights, recently wrote about how incensed he was by attempts to dismiss criticism of the treatment of migrant workers as racist, saying: \u201cAs a black African worker who made the 2022 World Cup possible, nothing \u2013 including the abuses to which I was subjected, and those that I witnessed \u2013 has been more infuriating \u2026 In Qatar, migrant workers are an expendable commodity.\u201d Qatar, and its supporters, argue that the country has introduced meaningful reforms, chiefly the dismantling of the abusive kafala system and the introduction of a minimum wage. But these only came into force 10 years after Qatar won the right to host the World Cup. And on the ground, little seems to have changed. The stories I heard from workers in Qatar last month are almost the same as those I heard when I began my reporting in 2013.  It would be oversimplistic to say exploitation in Qatar\u2019s labour system is based solely on race. Like everywhere, race, class and the profit motive combine to marginalise the most vulnerable. But Qatar\u2019s unique population \u2013 95% of the workforce is from overseas \u2013 its vast wealth and the attention it sought by hosting the World Cup have exposed and amplified these divisions. The Qatari authorities are not solely to blame. The day-to-day abuses endured by many low-wage workers are mostly meted out by other migrant workers, typically \u2013 according to many workers I have spoken to \u2013 managers from India and Egypt. As one worker told me: \u201cThe Qatari people are very good, but they have left the country in the hands of people who don\u2019t value human beings.\u201d Responsibility also lies with powerful Qatari business owners who appear to be untouchable. \u201cIt\u2019s a hierarchical system here where no one lower would dare try to do something against someone higher than them,\u201d a construction manager with years of experience in Qatar told me, by way of explaining how influential Qataris can act with impunity. And then there is Fifa, and scores of foreign companies and individuals who seem to have turned a blind eye while pocketing enormous profits and salaries. A 2018 British government press release claimed British firms were likely to secure deals worth \u00a31.5bn in the run-up to the tournament. Fifa earned a record $7.5bn in the four-year cycle leading up to this World Cup and yet has still failed to agree to a fund to compensate workers who have suffered and the families of those who have died. Ultimately the responsibility to protect migrant workers lies with governments, and by that standard the Qatari authorities have largely failed. To call this out is not racist, it\u2019s anti-racist."

                    "body": "The unique circumstances of the Qatar World Cup have created an unprecedented risk of injury during the tournament, the international players\u2019 union, Fifpro, has warned.\nWith the final fixtures in leagues including the Premier League taking place only a week before the tournament, a lack of preparation time will be a key factor in putting players at risk, according to the union. The impact of hot conditions and the accumulated workload of players in an already condensed season are other concerns, with the potential for injuries to disrupt not only the later stages of the World Cup but the remainder of the club season.\n\u201cI think the risk [of injury] is higher as is the risk of fatigue over the next four weeks and that players might not be available when the biggest matches are played,\u201d said Jonas Baer-Hoffmann, Fifpro\u2019s general secretary. \u201cI think the probability of that is certainly higher [than in other World Cups]. We might still see an incredible World Cup because players are leaving it all out there and we might see some countries playing miraculous football, but the bigger picture increases the probability of injury and increases the probability of fatigue-limiting performance. That is what the science says.\u201d\n\nFifpro will next week release a report investigating the impact a mid-season World Cup has had on player workload. Key findings are that players will have only seven days of pre-tournament preparation compared with a previous average of 31, and some players \u2013 including those in the Premier League \u2013 may have only eight days\u2019 recovery post-tournament before their league season starts again, compared with an average of 37 in past years.\nThe report also details the overload experienced by top players in European leagues, with Harry Kane having started every competitive fixture for Spurs this season and Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 playing 75% of his minutes in \u201cback-to-back matches\u201d, where players miss out on the recommended five-day break between games.\nDarren Burgess, a consultant with Fifpro and a former director of high performance at Arsenal, said the tournament had a greater number of absentees from soft-tissue injuries thanks to insufficient recovery time. He also said there was a \u201creally high risk\u201d of injury in Qatar not only for players who have played a lot of games but also for those \u2013 such as Kyle Walker or Harry Maguire \u2013 who lack match fitness or are \u201cunderloaded\u201d.\n\u201cAdd the heat in and you\u2019ve got an extra risk,\u201d he said. \u201cThe heat of Qatar is something a lot of teams haven\u2019t been exposed to and aren\u2019t used to.\u201d\nOn the absentees he said: \u201cThe number of soft-tissue injuries that have ruled players out of this World Cup is definitely higher because you just don\u2019t have time. Before if someone did their hamstring in the last game of the Premier League season you still had 35 days to restore that injury prior to your first World Cup. You just don\u2019t have that now.\u201d"

The Liverpool manager will not attend and admits he has no enthusiasm for a tournament shrouded in controversy, from the abuse of migrant workers to the treatment of LGBTQ+ fans. Klopp believes there should have been a robust challenge to Fifa\u2019s awarding of the competition to Qatar in 2010. In the absence of one, he insists it should not fall to the likes of Gareth Southgate and Harry Kane to lead any protests. \u201cI watched an old documentary about when it got announced that Russia and Qatar are the places for the next World Cups,\u201d the Liverpool manager said. \u201cWe all know how it happened and we all let it happen. No legal thing afterwards led to a real \u2026 what can I say? It was hidden everywhere but now it is open, now everybody knows, and you think: \u2018How could it happen?\u2019 It was 12 years ago. It\u2019s nothing to do with Qatar. They won the World Cup and now it is there. But in the moment you put it there, all the things that followed it up were clear. And the people who were involved at that time should have known.  \u201cLater on we talk about human rights in terms of the people who have to work there in circumstances that are, let me say it nicely, difficult. We couldn\u2019t play the World Cup there in the summer because of the temperature and there was not one stadium in Qatar, or maybe one. So you have to build stadiums. I don\u2019t think anybody thought on that day about somebody having to build them. It\u2019s not like Aladdin with his wonder lamp and: \u2018Boom, there\u2019s a new stadium.\u2019 The situation makes you angry. How can it not? \u201cI will watch it from a football point of view but I don\u2019t like the fact that players now have to send a message. You are all journalists. You should have sent the message but you didn\u2019t write the most critical articles about circumstances that were clear. There we are guilty. But now we are telling players they have to wear an armband and if they don\u2019t do it then they are not on their side. No, no, no; these are footballers, it is a tournament and the players must go there and play and do the best for their countries. It is nothing to do with the circumstances. \u201cThere are wonderful people there and it is not that everything is bad over there but how it happened was not right in the first place. But now it is there, let them play the game as players and managers. Don\u2019t put Gareth Southgate constantly in a situation where he has to talk about everything. He has an opinion but he\u2019s not a politician, I\u2019m not a politician; he\u2019s a manager of England so let him do that. If you want to write about something else then do it, but by yourself without asking us so that it\u2019s \u2018Klopp said\u2019 or \u2018Southgate said\u2019. As if that would change anything. You more than I let it happen 12 years ago.\u201d It was put to Klopp that the media has done more to expose human rights abuses in Qatar than anyone in the football community. \u201cBut not then,\u201d he replied. \u201cThere were plenty of chances in the next three or four years to say the process was not right and a lot of people took money for the wrong reasons.\u201d The Football Association is to challenge the \u00a330,000 sanction imposed on Klopp for his red card against Manchester City as it seeks a stronger punishment. Klopp was fined by an independent regulatory commission after accepting a charge of improper conduct for haranguing the assistant referee Gary Beswick during Liverpool\u2019s 1-0 win over City on 16 October. The FA and the Liverpool manager could appeal against the punishment after reviewing the commission\u2019s written reasons and, with Klopp having avoided a touchline ban, the former has confirmed it will challenge the sanction."

                    "body": "The biggest question for Iran before the World Cup is not how the team will perform against England, the USA and Wales but how the players will behave in Qatar against a domestic backdrop of protests, violent reaction from the regime and calls for the country to be thrown out of the tournament. Hints can be found in recent domestic games. On Wednesday one of Iran\u2019s biggest clubs, Esteghlal, won the Super Cup, but when presented with the trophy, most of the squad did not celebrate. State television quickly cut away. A month earlier their Tehran rivals Persepolis wore black wristbands in a league game against Tractor \u2013 only the international midfielder Mehdi Torabi did not. Few were surprised given that during a crackdown against protesters in 2019, Torabi scored and lifted his shirt to reveal the message: \u201cThe only way to save the country is to obey the leader.\u201d He later insisted it was his idea.  On 2 October, when a penalty was awarded to Persepolis with two minutes left, Torabi, who is not the designated taker, stepped up. His teammates (though not the fans because the stadiums are empty over concerns that they could become hotbeds of protests) braced themselves for another pro-government slogan but he missed and was immediately substituted. In Esteghlal\u2019s case, the players were perhaps mindful of criticism that greeted Mehdi Taremi in September. The Porto striker scored the only goal for Iran in a 1-0 win over Uruguay, finishing off a flowing move and giving Team Melli, who struggle to arrange friendlies against strong opposition, an impressive win. When Taremi celebrated in front of the small number of fans in the Vienna stadium, it sparked widespread criticism on social media at home. The popularity of the team\u2019s star player has yet to recover despite recent posts more supportive of the people.  Perhaps the Esteghlal players thought there wasn\u2019t much to celebrate. On 13 September Mahsa Amini was arrested by the morality police for \u201cunsuitable attire\u201d. Days later, she died in police custody, and protests up and down Iran are being met by force, coercion and arrests from a regime desperate to maintain its grip on power. According to human rights organisations, 253 protesters have been killed. Thousands have been arrested. \u201cThis is the team of the Islamic Republic, this is not Iran\u2019s team and it is definitely not my national team,\u201d a Tehran-based female football fan called Zeinab told the Observer. She thinks Iran should not go to Qatar. Others agree, including the Ukraine Football Association, which asked Fifa to throw Iran out for supplying Russia with weapons. Open Stadiums, a women\u2019s rights group that has campaigned for years for female fans to be allowed into stadiums in Iran, wrote an open letter to the world governing body calling for Iran\u2019s expulsion. Carlos Queiroz is of the opposite opinion. The former Real Madrid manager returned in September for a second spell as head coach, replacing Dragan Skocic as Iran attempt to get out of the group stage for the first time, at the sixth attempt. Before his third World Cup with the country, Queiroz said last week that there was no debate. \u201cMost of the Iranian people have a clear answer to this campaign,\u201d he said. \u201cThey want their national football team to participate in the 2022 World Cup.\u201d  There are critics of the regime who agree and do not see any benefits in more international isolation. Some say the tournament will provide a valuable opportunity for players to show their support for the protesters and their opposition to the regime on the world stage. The players are in a difficult position. There are likely to be consequences, or threats, to their families and loved ones if they speak out against a regime that has been in power for 43 years and is not about to let go quietly. In September, Iran\u2019s chief justice, Gholam-Hossein Mohseni-Ejei, promised punishment for \u201cthose who became famous thanks to support from the system [and] have joined the enemy when times were difficult, instead of being with the people.\u201d This warning came after Sardar Azmoun, one of the team\u2019s biggest stars, used Instagram to express frustration about the regime\u2019s violence. \u201cThe ultimate [punishment] is to be kicked out of the national team, which is a small price to pay for even a single strand of Iranian women\u2019s hair,\u201d he wrote. \u201cShame on you for easily killing the people and viva women of Iran. Long live Iranian women!\u201d  Days later the Bayer Leverkusen forward deleted the post. \u201cI have to apologise to the players of the national team,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause my hasty action caused my dear friends to be annoyed, and some players of the national team were insulted by users, which is not fair in any way. The mistake was mine.\u201d That suggests Azmoun\u2019s opinions are not shared by all his teammates. The unity of the squad had been fractured with the drawn-out summer coaching change, with Taremi among those in the pro-Queiroz camp and Azmoun supporting Skocic, who had led the team through qualification. There may well be divisions again. Torabi is the only open supporter of the regime but there may well be others who agree or don\u2019t want to get involved. It has happened before. In a 2009 World Cup qualifier in Seoul, most, but not all, of Iran\u2019s starting XI lined up wearing green armbands in apparent support of the \u201cGreen Movement\u201d which was in full flow back home. There seems to be more at stake this time. The World Cup may be insignificant in the grand scheme of the battle for Iran, but it could still be big enough to play a small part in determining the nation\u2019s future."

We were colonised, and colonisation never happens with flowers. It definitely acts as some motivation to win against them.\u201d\nArabi has celebrated every victory in Morocco\u2019s historic run, which has included victories against Spain (a former colonial power in Morocco), Portugal and Belgium, with his community in western Sydney. \u201cOur community here is not that big but still there is a good group here,\u201d he says.\n\u201cWe are all very, very proud. They play as a team, for the nation, for us. We here in Sydney are very happy, it\u2019s brought our community together.\u201d\nNow the community is preparing for the biggest football match in Arab history, the semi-final against France (a country also deeply involved in Morocco\u2019s colonial history) on Thursday morning Australian time, acutely aware they have become anchors to an escalating sense of pride in being Arab.\nVideos and photos of a wide variety of communities celebrating Moroccan wins in cities including London, Paris and New York have circulated widely.\n\u201cIt means more, in diaspora, in migration, it definitely means more,\u201d Arabi says. \n\nSign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup\n\nMoroccan flags fly high in Haldon Street in Lakemba, where shisha cafes have been showing the games at all times of the night. After Morocco defeated Portugal in the quarter-finals on Sunday morning, fans spilled on to the streets at 4.30am, beeping car horns and waving flags.\nAt Al Andalus cafe, its owner, Shade Zarqa, lines up his friends as the TV behind him blares out Moroccan pop music. \u201cYou see, we have an Egyptian, a Saudi and I am Palestinian,\u201d he says. \u201cThis is a space for all Arabs, and we are all celebrating Morocco.\n\u201cWe have shown every Morocco match here, their community comes here to watch it, we make them shisha even in the morning. But their victory is also a victory for all Arabs, we have never been happier as a community.\n\u201cThis is our maximum level of happiness.\u201d\n\nThe cafe, previously owned by Moroccans, has maintained its north African roots, with Moroccan flags hanging from the walls. It serves classic Arab coffee and double-apple shisha.\nZarqa says Al Andalus has become a makeshift community centre, bonding Arabs from all backgrounds.\n\u201cThis is like their own home, it\u2019s something special,\u201d he says. \u201cThey are our brothers. Our connection is stronger now. And that is across all Arabs, all Arabs feel like siblings.\u201d\nMorocco\u2019s success has come at the first World Cup held in an Arab country. Qatar has come under intense criticism for its treatment of migrant workers and minorities but the presence of so many fans from Middle Eastern and Arab countries has given the tournament an entirely different flavour from previous events.\nProf Karima Laachir, a director at the Australian National University\u2019s Centre for Arab and Islamic Studies, says it has been a turning point for Arab solidarity and the perception of Arabs in western countries.\n\u201cPan-Arab solidarity has always come from the ground up, between people who share language and culture, and it\u2019s always been there,\u201d she says.\n\n\u201cThere has been lots of attempts by some Arab states to divide and rule and follow certain kinds of ethno-nationalism but this tournament has showed it hasn\u2019t succeeded.\n\u201cThe joy is shared \u2013 it always has been.\u201d\nLaachir says Morocco\u2019s victories over European countries have been an opportunity to \u201cspeak back\u201d against lingering colonial narratives. \u201cIt\u2019s a chance to say, we are not backwards, we are not inferior. This is a chance at claiming pride in our achievements in post-colonial times.\n\u201cIt\u2019s really gratifying to see something good coming out of the region, a global success story on an Arab country.\n\u201cAnd I think that has produced a sense of pride, in coming out as Australian-Moroccan, or Dutch-Moroccan or Spanish-Moroccan, without feeling that you\u2019ll be on the receiving end of a torrent of racism.\u201d"

The concourse of the Ahmad Bin Ali Stadium was the kind of place you bumped into friends from school you hadn\u2019t seen for years, but everyone skipped pleasantries to go straight to the important stuff: \u201cWhy wasn\u2019t Kieffer playing? Don\u2019t we miss Joe Allen in midfield? Oh, you\u2019ve left the DVLA to start your own business and you\u2019ve just had twins? Nice one.\u201d\nWales were 1-0 down and had been dreadful, an uncharacteristically poor performance after a strange day. Maybe this is what World Cups are always like. I had nothing to go on.\nAs we walked around Doha, Mexicans, Argentinians and Ecuadorians recognised our replica shirts and shouted \u201cWales! Gales! Wales!\u201d We were clapped on to the metro by some Brazilians who asked for a photo with us. Astonishingly they knew about John Charles and the match our two countries played in the 1958 World Cup quarter-finals. If these fans were paid-for Fifa corporate shills, they had at least done the background reading.\n\nAs we walked around the Souq Waqif market there were local teenagers in Chelsea and Real Madrid shirts, proof if you needed it that even tiny gas- and oil-rich states in the Middle East aren\u2019t immune to football\u2019s global reach. The sheer number of people who mentioned Gareth Bale brought home the level of his fame. He is box office in a way that makes Anthony Hopkins, Catherine Zeta-Jones or Richard Burton shrink by comparison. Not bad for the son of a school caretaker from Cardiff.\nWales fans were filmed by the locals singing Calon L\u00e2n and I listened to my friend Trystan chat to an Ecuadorian woman in the international language of football, marvelling as he discussed Allen\u2019s hamstrings with her in a Llangefni accent so strong it could knock the Earth off its axis. As we walked to the ground via a shopping mall the size of Gloucester, fans from the US unsarcastically wished us luck and hoped we\u2019d have a good tournament.\nMaybe I am too schooled in the ways of British club football but it felt like a glimpse into a parallel universe \u2013 a conspicuous, almost unsettling lack of wanker signs as we walked to the ground past another Sunglass Hut and Louis Vuitton.\nEventually, excitedly taking photos of every Wales flag I saw became unsustainable, as we walked past restaurants and hotels that rose from the desert but were decked out like a primary school in Llanelli on St David\u2019s Day. After a pilgrimage to the giant Welsh bucket hat in one of the fan zones I took a photo of the sign describing Wales to the curious and uninitiated: \u201cWales is a nation that\u2019s home to acts of kindness, global business, open arms and brilliant ideas \u2026\u201d (if you want to find out more about our fans, our culture and our epic country, scan this QR code). \nWhen the Arsenal and Wales centre-half Mel Charles returned home from our last World Cup the ticket conductor at Swansea railway station spotted his suitcase and asked if he\u2019d been on his holidays. \u201cWe\u2019d just played in the World Cup quarter-finals,\u201d said Charles, incredulously. \u201cMaybe he hadn\u2019t been reading the papers.\u201d A lot has changed since 1958.\nAlongside 1,600 others I attended a party at a hotel, drinking Budweiser on the 55th floor at prices that were enough to make your knees knock. Joe Ledley was mobbed, Welsh football\u2019s cultural attach\u00e9 Dafydd Iwan played Yma o Hyd to scenes of delirium. I bumped into an old school friend of Gareth \u201cGO\u201d Jones, the schoolteacher who took me and hundreds like me to my first Wales international as a child, an act that had as profound an influence on my personality as learning to read.\n\nGO devoted himself completely selflessly to grassroots and youth football in west Wales, a lifetime of thankless tasks that came from an entirely pure, uncontaminated love of the game. \u201cDychmyga, Elis. Cymru yng Nghwpan y Byd. Bydde Gareth wrth ei fodd.\u201d (\u201cImagine, Elis. Wales in a World Cup. Gareth would have been delighted.\u201d)\nI spoke to members of the Rainbow Wall who had brought rainbow bucket hats to put on any empty seats, to represent their LGBTQ+ friends who didn\u2019t feel they could be there. Qatar could be brilliant. It was never far from being bleak.\n\nI\u2019m sure if we\u2019d qualified more often, our first game in a World Cup would have been less emotionally charged, an opening match of the group stage feeling as routine as brushing your teeth or apologising to the cashier at Boots for not having an Advantage card. If you take our form since the inception of the World Cup in 1930 as a guide, this will happen next when I am 106. No wonder I had a selfie with the Rwandan security guard who was an Arsenal fan and loved Aaron Ramsey. I wanted to soak it all in. We all did.\nAt the ground the anthem crackled but the team were listless. Nervy and flat-footed, we were lucky to go into the break 1-0 down. Kieffer Moore came on, the team improved immediately and they began to play with the zip the occasion demanded. Bale won the penalty, Bale took the penalty, our end went crackers. He Came, He Saw, He Equalised.\nAt full-time Neco Williams wept for his grandfather, who had died the day before. It reminded me of Ramsey, sobbing on the turf of the Cardiff City Stadium after we qualified as his thoughts turned to Gary Speed, the managerial adrenaline shot Welsh football needed so badly in 2010, and for whom qualification to a World Cup was always the ultimate ambition.\nI was told Wales fans had their rainbow bucket hats confiscated on the way into the ground and I wondered how many more promises would be broken before the tournament ended. Welcome to the World Cup.\nElis James has donated his fee for this column to Amnesty International, which is campaigning for Qatar and Fifa to establish a compensation fund for migrant workers"

Broadcasters such as the BBC and Telemundo chose to highlight those concerns in their coverage of the first day of the tournament, where the hosts lost to Ecuador after a lavish opening ceremony that included contributions from Morgan Freeman and Jungkook from BTS.  In contrast, Fox heaped praise on everything from the air-conditioning in the Al Bayt Stadium to the variety of food available to fans to the \u201cvery welcoming\u201d secretary general of Qatar\u2019s World Cup committee, Hassan Al-Thawadi. A puff piece with Al-Thawadi followed in which he was allowed to speak in glowing terms about the World Cup with no questions from interviewer Jenny Taft about concerns raised by journalists and human rights groups.  Roger Bennett, the influential co-host of the Men In Blazers podcast, posted a clip of the BBC\u2019s coverage and wrote: \u201cThis is how BBC opened coverage of World Cup 2022. Stark contrast to Fox Coverage in United States. Please take a minute to watch. This is how this World Cup should be contextualized.\u201d Grant Wahl, arguably the most prominent soccer journalist in the US, also tweeted a link to the BBC\u2019s opening day coverage and wrote: \u201cBig contrast between the Qatar regime-aligned coverage in the United States on Fox Sports and the coverage on the UK rights-holder.\u201d  Other viewers on Twitter asked Fox to \u201cchill out on the propaganda\u201d and to stop \u201cshilling for Qatar\u201d. In the lead-up to the World Cup, Fox executive producer David Neal said he did not believe viewers wanted to be distracted by off-field issues during the tournament. \u201cWe really believe viewers come to us at Fox Sports for the World Cup to see the World Cup,\u201d he said. Qatar Airways, the country\u2019s state-owned airline, is a major sponsor of Fox\u2019s World Cup coverage. In contrast, Telemundo, which owns the Spanish language broadcast rights for the World Cup in the US, said it intended to take a stronger line than Fox. \u201cI do think we have to talk about the legacy we leave. By the time the tournament\u2019s over, we [won\u2019t have been] ignoring the geopolitical issues that might arise,\u201d said Telemundo Deportes president Ray Warren. The US team at the World Cup have made a striking, if subtle, statement about their views. They have prominently displayed a rainbow logo at the team\u2019s training facility in a country where homosexuality is illegal. \u201cIt is not just Stateside that we want to bring attention to social issues, it is also abroad,\u201d said US head coach Gregg Berhalter this week. \u201cWe recognize that Qatar has made strides and there has been a ton of progress but there\u2019s some work still to do.\u201d"

                    "body": "A British engineer is in jail in Iraq and facing extradition to Qatar over missed repayments on a small bank loan, in a case said to highlight the perils facing those travelling to the Gulf state for the World Cup. Brian Glendinning, 43, who had been contracted to work on a BP refinery in Iraq, was arrested on an Interpol \u201cred notice\u201d at Baghdad airport on 12 September and has been in a police cell since awaiting an extradition hearing. The Qatari government is yet to file its request for extradition but Glendinning was informed on arrest that an Interpol notice had been issued by Qatar over missed payments, on what family members said had been an \u00a320,000 loan taken out in 2018 when he had worked in the country. Glendinning\u2019s wife, Kimberly, 39, a beauty therapist, said her husband had struggled to make the full payments after becoming ill this Christmas and losing his job in Scotland but that monthly instalments had still been made to the Qatar National Bank with whom he was in regular touch. Radha Stirling, the founder of IPEX, an NGO seeking reform of Interpol and the extradition process, said the use of a red notice over such a minor issue should be taken as a warning to football fans travelling to the World Cup, which starts in Qatar on 20 November. Stirling said that Qatar had a history of abusing the Interpol system, through which the relatives of those targeted were often forced to pay out sums in excess of that owed in order to avoid their loved ones facing lengthy jail sentences. The case raises concerns that the smallest transgression by travelling fans could be used as an excuse by the Qatar government to chase British nationals once the finals are finished. Qatar is preparing to host 1.2 million visitors for the World Cup, including fans travelling to watch England and Wales. Former England captain David Beckham has signed a lucrative deal to promote the finals, a move that his former Manchester United teammate Eric Cantona described as a \u201cbig mistake\u201d given Qatar\u2019s human rights record. Stirling said: \u201cWe will make every diplomatic and legal effort to save Brian from extradition. Qatar is making itself a nuisance and costing taxpayers a lot of money. \u201cWe\u2019ve helped Brits arrested in Spain [on an Interpol notice issued by Qatar], many times, the Czech Republic, Italy, Denmark, Ukraine and so on. The police and court time is costly and the victim can be unfairly detained throughout the trial. \u201cIt\u2019s a human rights issue and clearly highlights Qatar\u2019s intimate relationship with Interpol. With the World Cup coming up, Qatar should be mindful of rights attacks towards foreigners.\u201d Glendinning, a father of three from Kincardine, west of Edinburgh, could face a lengthy imprisonment in Baghdad as the Iraqi authorities do not enforce the general rule that an extradition request should be made within 45 days of arrest. His brother, John, 39, said: \u201cBrian is a hardworking man who has always put his family first. He is the life and soul of any family occasion or party, where he earns the name happy feet, given to his dancing skills. Anyone who meets Brian ends up calling him friend, much loved and well liked in the village of Kincardine where he was brought up and still lives today.\u201d"

                    "body": "Fifa has increased its World Cup revenue by more than $1bn (\u00a3840m) after taking the tournament to Qatar, the governing body has revealed.\nGianni Infantino, the subject of widespread criticism on Saturday after a provocative opening speech, shared information regarding the record income with his national associations on Sunday.\n\nRevenue generated by the four-year cycle of the Qatar World Cup (from 2018 to 2022, including an extra five months because of the winter schedule) will reach $7.5bn, compared with $6.4bn for the previous cycle in Russia.\nWith television rights deals agreed a decade ago, the Guardian understands much of the uplift has been created by a recent increase in sponsorship and there has also been a reduction in costs because of the compact nature of the tournament.\nSponsorship has been boosted by a series of lucrative deals with Qatari companies, including the announcement in March of the state-owned oil and gas company QatarEnergy as tournament partner. Qatar Energy joined the state-owned Qatar Airways on the top tier of sponsors, and the telecoms company Ooredoo \u2013 which is 68% owned by the state \u2013 was named in the same month as \u201cofficial global connectivity services provider\u201d. The Qatari National Bank group \u2013 joint owned by the state and the Qatari public \u2013 is the \u201cofficial Middle East and Africa supporter\u201d and \u201cofficial Qatari Bank\u201d of the tournament.\n\nFifa has made substantial cost savings from scheduling a tournament essentially in one city. All eight World Cup stadiums are within a 50km radius of Doha, which has allowed organisers to use a single set of tournament infrastructure \u2013 including media facilities and hotels \u2013 and cut down substantially on travel costs for which Fifa is liable.\nFifa officials estimate the windfall will generate an extra $700,000 in investment for the game, with $300,000 accounted for in emergency Covid funding. The next four years will also see an increase in funding for Fifa\u2019s forward programme with $200m to be spent each year on international talent development, a project overseen by Ars\u00e8ne Wenger. Fifa says that more funding will also be accompanied by an increased oversight on spending.\nInfantino has been urged by a coalition of charities and NGOs to commit to paying $440m, equivalent to the pool of World Cup prize money, as compensation to migrant workers who were harmed in building the World Cup in Qatar and to the families of those workers who died. Infantino addressed the topic on Saturday, saying a fund would be established but that \u201cthe amount will be decided after the World Cup\u201d and that \u201canyone who wants to invest shall invest\u201d. It is understood the topic was not raised during Sunday\u2019s meeting.\nInfantino, the subject of mockery after he compared himself to a migrant worker in his address to open the World Cup, has received some support from the Welsh first minister, who is in Qatar for the tournament despite complaints at home.\nMark Drakeford said that while the Fifa president\u2019s speech reminded him of the former chancellor Denis Healy\u2019s first law of holes \u2013 \u201cwhen you\u2019re in one, stop digging\u201d \u2013 he thought Infantino had made valid points about the need for western countries to confront their own history before criticising the contemporary failings of others.\n\u201cWales is an outward-looking, inclusive nation where people\u2019s rights really matter to us,\u201d Drakeford said. \u201cBut it wasn\u2019t always like that. In our own history, we have had times when things that we have done, including things that we have done in other parts of the world, wouldn\u2019t measure up to the sorts of beliefs and standards that we hold ourselves to today. So to take a moment to reflect on our own histories, it\u2019s not a moment wasted.\u201d"

Lycett had set the former England footballer a deadline of midday on Sunday to withdraw from his role at the tournament. If Beckham pulled out as a Qatar World Cup ambassador before the start of the event, Lycett was offering to donate \u00a310,000 of his own money to gay charities. If Beckham did not, the plan was to shred it, along with what Lycett called the former England captain\u2019s \u201cstatus as gay icon\u201d. The eye-catching stunt highlighted concerns about the World Cup being hosted in a country where homosexuality can be punished by up to seven years in prison.  Beckham, who in 2002 posed for the cover of the gay magazine Attitude, saying he was \u201chonoured to have the tag of gay icon\u201d, has faced mounting criticism over his association with the Qatar tournament. The value of the deal is disputed but some say he was offered \u00a3150m by the Gulf state. Lycett tweeted a video of the stunt just after midday, with the words \u201cA platform for progress\u201d, a Beckham quote about the Qatar tournament. Dressed in rainbow feathers, he put what appeared to be two bundles of cash into a shredder before curtseying to the camera.  Lycett first posted a video on 13 November asking the footballer to reconsider his deal with the Arab country. \u201cIf you end your relationship with Qatar, I will donate ten grand of my own money (that\u2019s a grand for every million you\u2019re reportedly getting) to charities that support queer people in football,\u201d he said. \u201cHowever, if you do not I will throw the money into a shredder at midday next Sunday, just before the opening ceremony of the World Cup and stream it right here. Not just the money, but also your status as gay icon will be shredded.\u201d Beckham has not yet publicly acknowledged or responded to the comedian.  The stunt divided people online. Many showed support for Lycett under the hashtag #BendersLikeBeckham, but others were uncomfortable with destroying money during a cost of living crisis. Some questioned whether the money was real. The former culture secretary Nadine Dorries had urged the comedian to rethink before the stunt went ahead, tweeting: \u201cShredding 10k will earn Joe Lycett far more than it will cost him and is in effect a paid-for publicity stunt which has worked. \u201cJob done. No one will think any worse of him now if he changes his mind at the last minute and donates it to a homeless shelter in time for Christmas.\u201d"

                    "body": "Ever since the 2022 World Cup was awarded to Qatar by Fifa in 2010, there has been much talk about the human rights implications of the tournament. And for the past two years, the Socceroos \u2013 with the support of their union, Professional Footballers Australia \u2013 have been undertaking their own fact-finding to better understand the reality of the situation they might be entering if they qualified. Briefings have been organised with many key bodies: Fifa and the local organising committee, the Supreme Committee for Legacy and Development; Fifpro, the global player\u2019s union; human rights group Amnesty International; and groups that advocate for workers in Qatar, including the International Trade Union Confederation and Building and Wood Workers\u2019 International.  But in September, having qualified mid-year in a dramatic shoot-out, the players decided they needed to go straight to the source. With the help of PFA, a briefing was arranged with several migrant workers who have been involved in the A$470bn construction extravaganza needed to prepare a tiny nation of less than three million people for the biggest sporting event in the world. According to sources present at the briefing, held via Zoom just prior to the Socceroos\u2019 recent friendlies, it was not a happy conversation. \u201cThe working conditions are horrendous,\u201d alleged one participant. Despite much talk from Fifa and Qatar authorities about law reform to strengthen labour rights, the migrant workers on whose back the World Cup has been built continue to suffer labour rights violations. Analysis by the Guardian has found that more than 6,500 migrant workers from India, Pakistan, Nepal, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka have died in Qatar since it won hosting rights for the World Cup \u2013 many of whom likely worked on projects relating to the tournament. (Qatari officials have said only three workers have died on-site while building stadiums \u2013 a claim that has been disputed). Reports alleging workplace injuries, unpaid wages, squalid accommodation conditions and workplace abuse are widespread. \u201cThe World Cup is the pinnacle for any player and we know how much qualification means for the nation and the game,\u201d Socceroos midfielder Jackson Irvine tells Guardian Australia. \u201cOver the past two years we have engaged with human rights groups and migrant workers directly to better understand the situation in Qatar.\u201d  A campaign led by Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International and FairSquare, \u201c#PayUpFifa\u201d, has been calling on Fifa to establish a fund for workers, to ensure compensation for labour rights abuses. Despite backing for the campaign from the Belgian, French, English, German, Dutch, Welsh and American football assocations, Fifa is yet to agree to the proposal. \u201cWe know there has been progress,\u201d says Irvine. \u201cBut we also know that much more needs to be done to fully implement the reforms and the establishment of a migrant workers centre is critical to continued progress.\u201d  Concerns about labour standards are just one part of the human rights-based objection to the 2022 World Cup being held in Qatar. Political and civil rights are significantly constrained in the authoritarian state, with the hereditary emir holding all executive and legislative authority. Freedom House ranked Qatar \u201cnot free\u201d it in latest assessment, which noted that \u201cwhile Qatari citizens are among the wealthiest in the world, most of the population consists of non-citizens with no political rights, few civil liberties, and limited access to economic opportunity.\u201d Homosexuality is illegal in Qatar and there have been concerns about the treatment of LGBTQI+ visitors to the World Cup. \u201cFifa\u2019s decision in 2010 to hand the World Cup hosting rights to Qatar was misguided then and continues to attract justified criticism,\u201d says Justine Nolan, a law professor and director of UNSW\u2019s Australian Human Rights Institute (AHRI). \u201cFifa\u2019s more recent adoption of policies that espouse non-discrimination and respect for human rights does not square with Qatar\u2019s policies and practices that actively discriminate against women, migrant workers and LGBTQ+ peoples.\u201d In its final report on the situation ahead of the World Cup, published last week, Amnesty said that there was \u201cstill a long way to go\u201d in addressing human rights and labour rights issues in Qatar. \u201cDespite the positive evolution of Qatar\u2019s labour system, substantial work remains to effectively implement and enforce these [changes],\u201d the report says. \u201cUltimately, human rights abuses persist on a significant scale today.\u201d *** Last week, legal experts and sporting administrators gathered at a hotel in central Sydney to discuss the growing focus on the human rights implications of sporting mega-events. Convened by the AHRI, the event was made all the more topical by recent collisions between sport and politics in Australian sports, including netball, cricket and Australian rules football. The conference discussed sportswashing, a global phenomenon with significant domestic implications. \u201cIn the lead-up to the World Cup some teams are choosing to stand up for rights and yet Football Australia (FA) remains silent, seemingly overlooking the human cost of staging this extravaganza in Qatar,\u201d says Nolan, who co-convened the event.  In contrast, many other nations participating in the World Cup have publicly called out the human rights implications of the tournament. The Danish national team will wear a special \u201cprotest\u201d kit; England players will sport a rainbow \u201cone love\u201d armband (Fifa are yet to approve the design, which will also be worn by several other European teams). A spokesperson for FA told Guardian Australia that it has been engaged in an ongoing \u201cprocess of education and dialogue to gather information on the situation regarding the preservation of human rights and worker welfare in connection with the hosting of the Fifa World Cup Qatar 2022.\u201d The spokesperson acknowledged recent legal reforms in Qatar and said that FA urged \u201ccompanies and organisations working in Qatar to continue the path to reform and ensure the new legislative standards are met\u201d. FA has also indicated it has undertaken due diligence in relation to all service providers it will use during the tournament, ensuring they \u201cmeet the new compliance standards in a socially responsible way\u201d.  This scrutiny on FA\u2019s own direct impact is expected to continue during the tournament. \u201cThe players will continue to work with FA to ensure that every measure possible is taken to ensure they do not contribute to harm through their participation at the World Cup and that in the event harm occurs, there is access to effective remedy,\u201d says PFA co-chief executive Kathryn Gill, a former Matildas player.  Sources with knowledge of internal dynamics at FA have indicated that its membership of the Asian Football Confederation (AFC) is a complicating factor. Unlike European football federations, which have limited ongoing engagement with Middle Eastern counterparts, Australian officials and teams are interacting with and playing against Qatari counterparts and neighbouring nations on a regular basis. Speaking up too loudly now could cause political headaches in the future, further ostracising FA within AFC circles. But that has not stopped the players. Guardian Australia understands that the Socceroos will issue a joint statement ahead of the tournament, highlighting the ongoing labour rights and human rights concerns associated with Qatar 2022. \u201cFA, PFA and the players will have more to say before the tournament commences,\u201d confirmed the FA spokesperson. \u201cTalking a stand is always a risk but as members of a union we know we have support,\u201d says the Socceroos captain, Mat Ryan. \u201cWe are advocating for the same things we value as players \u2013 respect and dignity as a worker. We want to ensure that football is a positive force and that means we need to play our part in ensuring this is the case.\u201d Nor, according to Irvine, will that be the last of it. \u201cWe all have a role to play and as players we have focused on how we can have an impact,\u201d he says. \u201cWe know that public pressure has helped to facilitate change and the workers have asked us to keep the pressure up. As a country regularly playing in the region we have a responsibility to continue to do this \u2013 not just now but after the final whistle of the World Cup.\u201d"

                    "body": "\n 5.37pm  \n\nRight, so this blog kicked off this morning with updates with that turned out to be a staggering speech from Gianni Infantino. I am about to sign off for the evening but before I do, here is great piece of analysis from Paul MacInnes on the Fifa president\u2019s rambling address.\nInfantino told the world he feels Arab, African, gay and disabled, while the media are racist hypocrites. So how accurate was his World Cup monologue?\n\n\n\n\n 5.23pm  \n\nDavid Beckham loves an opening ceremony appearance, so this from Simon\u2019s suggestion that (Sir) David could assume the John Gordon Sinclair role and deliver a heartfelt version of \u2018We Have A Dream\u2019 is a good shout. Alan has submitted: \u2018Fistful of Dollars\u2019 by Babe Ruth, not familiar to me but based on the title alone it merits inclusion.\n\n\n\n 5.09pm  \n\nAt the behest of themselves, Qatar will feature in the opening game of the World Cup tomorrow.\nAsian football specialist John Duerden\u2019s latest piece says that the pressure is on F\u00e9lix S\u00e1nchez to ensure Qatar do not follow South Africa into the unwanted record books as a host nation to fall at the group stage. \n\n\n\n\n 4.51pm  \n\nBack to the opening ceremony, Derek is on the right track with his suggestion.\nHe writes in: How about Pavement\u2019s \u2018Zurich is Stained\u2019? It clocks in at under two minutes, making it perfectly succinct for the opening ceremony. Malkmus and the lads were always the masters of irony.\n\n\n\n 4.39pm  \n\nThis might have slipped under the radar amid all the goings on in Qatar, but it was virtually confirmed this week that Gianni Infantino will be reappointed Fifa president by acclamation next year. This is due to no other candidate standing against him.\nAccording to PA Media, the FA will support Infantino\u2019s re-election, but on a number of conditions. In the short term, the FA is keeping pressure on Fifa to contribute to the establishment of a support centre and compensation scheme for migrant workers in Qatar.\nLonger term, the PA Media report says that FA support for Infantino is conditional on no new threats being posed in the revised international calendar. Earlier this year, FA chief executive Mark Bullingham said his organisation\u2019s opposition to the introduction of biennial World Cups in the men\u2019s or women\u2019s game, and any future moves could weaken the FA\u2019s support for Infantino.\nThe FA also wants to see stricter human rights criteria applied to future bids, amid reports Saudi Arabia is interested in co-hosting the 2030 finals.\nThe German FA announced earlier this week it would not support Infantino\u2019s bid for re-election, citing Fifa\u2019s handling of human rights issues in Qatar and its failure to take a stand on Iran\n\nUpdated at 5.26pm GMT\n\n\n 4.25pm  \n\nA couple more suggestions for our alternative opening ceremony setlist:\nBill offers up an Infantino tribute with Larkin Poe\u2019s \u2018Keep Diggin\u2019 and Jerry suggests Ian Drury\u2019s \u2018Sex &amp; Drugs &amp; Rock &amp; Roll\u2019. The latter might be a bit too on the nose for me, I am thinking more irony and less mockery, but keep them coming in. \n\n\n\n 4.16pm  \n\nThe perception might be that squad morale in the Portugal camp is not all that high. Not the case, according to Bernando Silva, who says the mood is \u201ctop, top, top\u201d.\nJamie Jackson has the story:\n\n\n\n\n 4.07pm  \n\nQatar head coach F\u00e9lix S\u00e1nchez has a big job on his hands. Usually the World Cup hosts get a decent neutral backing but that was not the case in Russia and is not likely to be this time around either. \nAndy Hunter\u2019s latest from Doha:\n\n\n\n\n 4.01pm  \n\nWe might have opened up a can of worms here but I am more than happy to get the spoon out and dig in.\nEmail from Thomas: Other opening ceremony song ideas, maybe Rose Royce\u2019s 70s disco funk classic \u2018Car Wash\u2019 sung to the alternative lyrics of \u2018sportswash\u2019?\nSend in more suggestions for (in)appropriate opening ceremony songs and let us see what kind of setlist we can draw up.\n\n\n\n 3.38pm  \n\nEmail from Kurt simply asks: Will John Lennon\u2019s \u2018Imagine\u2019 be played at the World Cup opening ceremony?\n\nImagine there\u2019s no countries\u2026\n\nGreat question. I imagine Kurt has his tongue firmly in his cheek and the Tokyo Olympics opening ceremony on the brain. It certainly seems an odd fit for a competition literally pitting countries against each other, but those oscillating at the top of the global governing body ecosystem seem to love that song. \nThe only names on the confirmed list for the opening ceremony so far are Robbie Williams and Jungkook from BTS. The latter will perform a song called \u2018Dreamers\u2019, apparently. \nOthers rumoured to be performing are the Black Eyed Peas and Nora Fatehi.\n\n\n\n 3.18pm  \n\nThanks Barry. We had a bit of an update on the Wales squad earlier, Ben Fisher will be the man on the ground for us following Rob Page\u2019s team in Qatar:\n\n\nUpdated at 3.22pm GMT\n\n\n 3.05pm  \n\nThat\u2019s all from me. Still reeling from that Gianni Infantino press conference, I\u2019m off for a lie-down in a darkened room. Tom Bassam is ready to take up the cudgels. Have a great weekend, everyone. \n\n\n\n 3.00pm  \n\nPoland: Hands up who\u2019d completely forgotten that Aston Villa defender Matty Cash will be at the World Cup with Poland? Well, consider me temporarily typing one-handed with the other arm raised in the air as I\u2019m reminded Cash will face his Aston Villa teammate Emi Martinez when Poland take on Argentina. \n\u201cObviously when we step on the pitch, we become rivals although we are team mates at Villa,\u201d said Cash. \u201cIt\u2019s another massive game against a really strong opponent.\u201d\nIn Qatar, English-born defender Cash will play his first major tournament with Poland after being granted citizenship last year. The 25-year-old, who has seven caps for Poland, qualified for citizenship through his mother and grandfather.\n\u201cEverybody dreams of playing at a major tournament and it has come now [at the World Cup], which is really exciting,\u201d he said. \u201cI really like pressure and think playing in the Premier League is pressure in itself... I want to prove myself on the biggest stage and this is the time to do it.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n 2.51pm  \n\nQatar: Despite the shiny veneer on the ground in Doha, exploitation lies just beneath the surface. Emma Kemp reports from Doha. \n\n\n\n\n 2.31pm  \n\nMore from Eric Dier: England\u2019s Eric Dier has described the \u201cterrible situation\u201d for migrant workers in Qatar as disappointing and said that controversies away from the pitch have stripped away some of his excitement about the World Cup. Jacob Steinberg reports from Doha.\n\n\n\n\n 2.09pm  \n\n\n\n\n\n 1.56pm  \n\nEngland: England defender Eric Dier says it would be wrong to ignore off-field matters in Qatar but says constant questions about the cloud hanging over this World Cup is dampening players\u2019 excitement.\nThe Gulf nation\u2019s human rights record, treatment of migrant workers and oppressive LGBTQ+ laws have dominated the build-up to the 22nd edition of the tournament and this morning, Gianni Infantino took aim at European critics of Qatar on the eve of the World Cup in an extraordinary media conference that finished Dier spoke to the media.\n\u201cIt\u2019s extremely difficult every day for all of us as players,\u201d said Dier, who had not seen Infantino\u2019s press conference. \u201cWe come here and we know these topics are going to be addressed and it\u2019s a difficult situation for us.\n\u201cThe World Cup was awarded here to Qatar in 2010 and I was 16 at the time. It\u2019s very difficult for me to talk on it because we as players have absolutely no say in where we play. Those decisions are made by people way above us and obviously we\u2019re the ones who end up sitting here having to answer these kind of questions. It\u2019s a difficult situation for us.\n\u201cNot just us, every team, every player is going to experience it throughout the whole tournament. It\u2019s disappointing. For me individually, I carry the values I\u2019ve been given by my family and what I\u2019ve grown up with, how people have educated me. I carry those values wherever I go. At the same time, I respect everywhere that I go.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been here a very short time so, for me, it\u2019s important to live this experience and then at that point have a much better idea of what to say on it. A lot of things have already happened - a lot of things are very disappointing - and those will always be in my mind. But as a team, and individually, we carry certain values and no matter where we go we\u2019ll carry those values. And at the same time, we\u2019ll respect everywhere we go. It\u2019s difficult for me to talk about that kind of situation.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n 1.38pm  \n\n\n\n\n\n 1.36pm  \n\nIn case you missed it: Fifa president Gianni Infantino gave a quite extraordinary press conference in Doha this morning, during which he angrily railed against critics of Fifa and the World Cup host nation, likened himself to an impoverished migrant worker and accused westerners of hypocrisy and racism. Sean Ingle was there to see it all unfold \u2026 \n\n\n\n\n 1.31pm  \n\nWales: Wales trained today and Aaron Ramsey, Gareth Bale, Chris Mepham, Ethan Ampadu and Jonny Williams all worked \u2013 or at least began the session \u2013 away from the main group. This should not be a cause for alarm among Wales fans, as their workloads are being managed individually. Joe Allen is still training alone to work on his fitness after a long spell on the sidelines, but is unlikely to feature in Wales\u2019s opener against the USA on Monday.\n\n\n\n\n 1.21pm  \n\nQatar national team: Qatar coach Felix Sanchez believes the World Cup can be a force for good but described the deaths of migrant workers as a \u201ctragedy\u201d on the eve of his side\u2019s opening game.\nQatar will make their World Cup debut with an opening Group A fixture against Ecuador tomorrow and the Spanish coach, who has worked in Qatar for 16 years, becoming manager of the senior team in 2017, was asked about the issues ahead of the match.\n\u201cA lot has been said about this, with some misinformation,\u201d he said. \u201cIn my opinion some of the comments weren\u2019t completely fair. Obviously the loss of human life during working is the greatest tragedy we can endure, whether here in Qatar or anywhere else in the world.\n\u201cWe hope this World Cup means that all together we can work to improve conditions of these groups, not just in Qatar but everywhere else in the world.\u201d\nSuch is the level of controversy that participants from all nations have faced questions. A reporter sought to ask Ecuador midfielder Moises Caicedo about it during Saturday\u2019s press conference, but coach Gustavo Alfaro stepped in before the Brighton player responded.\n\u201cPlease don\u2019t put us in trouble,\u201d Alfaro said. \u201cWe are in favour of all human rights, that\u2019s for sure. They are good players with their own talents, their own dreams and hopes, and they deserve to be praised for that.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n 1.05pm  \n\nGianni Infantino: Following the Fifa president\u2019s jaw-dropping press conference this morning, the man who sat alongside him throughout took his turn to speak to the press. Bryan Swanson, the former Sky Sports News journalist, has been Fifa\u2019s head of media relations since 2021 and mounted a robust defence of his boss.\n\u201cI am sitting here as a gay man in Qatar,\u201d said Swanson. \u201cWe have received assurances that everyone will be welcome and I believe everyone will be.\n\u201cJust because he [Infantino] is not gay, does not mean he does not care. He does. You see the public side and I see the private side. I have thought long and hard about whether I should say this. I do feel strongly about it.\n\u201cWe care about everyone at Fifa. I have a number of gay colleagues. I am fully aware of the debate and fully respect people\u2019s opinions. When he says we are inclusive. He means it.\u201d\nQatar have given other assurances that have already proved less than convincing so I\u2019m not sure why Bryan feels so confident their guarantee that members of the LBGT+ community will be welcomed with open arms is iron clad. Time will tell.\n\n\nUpdated at 2.22pm GMT\n\n\n 12.53pm  \n\nWales: Drink it in boys. Give them some Welsh sugar! Yma o Hyd!\n\n\n\n\n 12.50pm  \n\nEngland: Gareth Southgate must get the best out of his creative players or England risk going no further than the quarter-finals, writes Bristol City manager and former England women\u2019s international Anita Asante, who is worried about the team\u2019s \u201ccautious mentality\u201d. \n\n\n\n\n 12.36pm  \n\nGianni Infantino: Hmmmm. On the Fifa website\u2019s equivalent of this rolling blog, there is not a single mention of Gianni Infantino\u2019s remarkable press conference, which took place at least four hours ago. There is, however, a mention of his call for respect for the tournament referees at a previous presser. \n\u201cI am asking everyone to try to put yourselves in the shoes of the referees just for a moment,\u201d he said. \u201cImagine you were on the ground in front of 80,000 people in a stadium, a few hundred million on television and you have to take instant decisions which can affect entire countries.\u201d\nItalian referee Daniele Orsato will be the first official to go under the microscope when he referees the tournament opener between the hosts Qatar and Ecuador at Al Bayt Stadium tomorrow. No pressure, Daniele. \n\n\n\n\n 12.22pm  \n\n\n\n\n\n 12.19pm  \n\nWales: Guardian interviewer Don McRae and photographer Tom Jenkins are both very nice men who are the very top of their respective trades. From the composer and singer of Wales\u2019s rousing anthem to the country\u2019s most-capped footballer, they have collaborated to hear the voices and shoot the images that matter before the country heads off to its first World Cup finals since 1958.\n\n\nUpdated at 12.20pm GMT\n\n\n 12.15pm  \n\nGianni Infantino: Here\u2019s the thing; this morning\u2019s extraordinary, borderline deranged monologue delivered by the Fifa president was actually supposed to be a Q&amp;A with the world\u2019s media. One presumes that by filibustering his way through it for just shy of an hour, Infantino was hoping to keep questions to a minimum and his ploy certainly worked, albeit not in the way he might have hoped.\nThose present and those of us who have since seen his tin-eared ramblings all appear to have been utterly gobsmacked by his self-indulgent, messianic speech, which is now making sensational headlines around the world for all the wrong reasons. Not content with insulting the many migrant workers who have been treated so disgracefully over the past decade and beyond, the Fifa president also said that anyone who accused Qatar of paying \u201cfans\u201d to support certain teams is racist. \u201cThis is racism,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is pure racism and we have to stop that.\u201d \nIn other completely unrelated news, fans who have travelled to Qatar as part of a controversial paid-for supporters programme have been told by Qatari authorities that their cash has been cut. \n\n\n\n\n 11.56am  \nSummary\n\nArmband news: England captain Harry Kane is still set to wear the \u2018OneLove\u2019 rainbow armband against discrimination at the World Cup despite Fifa announcing plans for its own band featuring a number #vagueplatitudes on the eve of the tournament.\nFifa confirmed its armbands would be worn as part of a partnership with United Nations agencies and the Football Association is understood to be seeking clarity on whether that and the \u2018OneLove\u2019 version can be worn together.\nWhile it respects the Fifa-UN initiative, the FA intends to continue supporting the \u2018OneLove\u2019 campaign, in a country where same-sex relationships are criminalised. FA chief executive Mark Bullingham has said the FA is even prepared to be fined over the issue, having had no response from Fifa to a request for permission to wear it earlier in the autumn.\nThe game\u2019s global governing body said captains of the 32 nations would wear armbands in support of different social campaigns at each stage of the tournament. The theme in the quarter-finals will be \u2018no discrimination\u2019. Wales are another of the nine European nations set to wear the \u2018OneLove\u2019 armbands during the tournament.\nIt is perhaps worth noting that many members of the LGBTQ+ community have been critical of the \u2018OneLove\u2019 armband, describing it as a kop out because it is not a rainbow design and because the FA have at no point clarified exactly what it stands for. Adam Crafton from The Athletic has been particularly vocal on this point and his Twitter timeline makes for interesting reading on this and a range of other topics.\n\n\nUpdated at 12.05pm GMT\n\n\n 11.43am  \n\nThanks Will and hello to all our leaders. Today I feel Qatari, Arabic, African, gay, disabled, like a migrant and more than a little nauseated by Gianni Infantino\u2019s tone deaf, almost hour-long insult to our intelligence and the tens of thousands of migrant workers who were treated so appallingly in the 12-year long build-up to this World Cup. What an odious, hypocritical, self-serving creep the Fifa president is. \n\n\n\n 11.36am  \n\nIt\u2019s time for me to hand over to Barry Glendenning. What did you make of Infantino\u2019s speech, Barry? We\u2019re all looking forward to finding out.\n\n\n\n 11.28am  \n\nIn case you missed it, here\u2019s Barney Ronay on Emmanuel Macron joining the monotonous chorus of shiny suits calling on people to keep politics out of football. Unless your name is Gianni Infantino, in which case it\u2019s OK to politicise football in the crassest way imaginable.\n\n\nUpdated at 11.29am GMT\n\n\n 11.12am  \n\nAnyway, what better time for Fifa to release their #FootballUnitesTheWorld message? A cynic might say that their largely vacuous new \u201csocial campaign\u201d is an attempt to flood our screens and obscure the fact that some players will be wearing \u201cOneLove\u201d armbands in support of LGBTQ+ rights. But, no, they wouldn\u2019t be that sly, would they?\n\n\nUpdated at 12.00pm GMT\n\n\n 10.54am  \n\nIn case anyone has forgotten, it\u2019s only a few weeks since Infantino wrote a letter to all 32 teams at the World Cup urging them not to talk politics and to \u201cfocus on the football\u201d.\nLaunching into an incredibly pernicious, misleading and inflammatory harangue on the eve of the tournament is fine, though. Hypocrisy? You be the judge.\n\n\nUpdated at 10.56am GMT\n\n\n 10.39am  \n\nSomeone has shared their thoughts on Infantino via Twitter! Unfortunately, they are unpublishable.\n\n\n\n 10.36am  \n\nWhile Infantino is busy feeling like a migrant worker from the comfort of his sofa, here\u2019s a timely reminder of how the story of the brutal working conditions for low-paid labourers in Qatar has developed over the last decade.\n\n\n\n\n 10.24am  \n\nHas Infantino\u2019s speech gone down well, then? It\u2019s probably best for him not to check Twitter for a while. Or the news media. Or television. Or anywhere outside of his reality-bending Fifa bubble.\n\n\n\n\nUpdated at 10.25am GMT\n\n\n 10.13am  \n\nHere\u2019s a reminder of what conditions for migrant workers in Qatar are like. Infantino empathises, obviously, just as long as nobody is overly critical.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated at 10.14am GMT\n\n\n 10.00am  \nInfantino\u2019s speech\n\n\u201cToday I have strong feelings. Today I feel Qatari, I feel Arab, I feel African, I feel gay, I feel disabled, I feel [like] a migrant worker.\u201d\nIt was a strong start from Infantino, that\u2019s for sure. Why exactly the multimillionaire Fifa president thinks he can identify with a migrant worker labouring on low wages in exploitative and dangerous conditions on a Qatari infrastructure project, only he knows.\nThen again, given that he went on to say \u201cI know what it feels to be discriminated \u2026 I was bullied because I had red hair\u201d \u2013 drawing an absurd false equivalence between himself and LGBTQ+ people who face repression and criminalisation in Qatar \u2013 an iota of self-awareness is clearly too much to ask. Here are the main points from his press conference in Doha, in case you\u2019d like to have your intelligence insulted further.\n\n\n\n\n 9.45am  \nPreamble\n\nHello, and welcome to our World Cup buildup blog. What\u2019s that? Gianni Infantino has done a speech? No doubt it was a sensible, coherent, morally sound \u2026 sorry, he said what?!\n\n\n"

                    "body": "As 32 teams gather in Qatar for this most unsettling of World Cups, the following numbers serve as a stark reminder of the human cost of the tournament, as well as the ongoing suffering among migrant workers, women and the LGBTQ+ community in the country.\nGianni Infantino, Fifa\u2019s president, wants us to focus solely on football. Many will. But the World Cup\u2019s impact should not only be measured on the balance sheet or the tournament\u2019s roll of honour, but in the realities of ordinary people\u2019s lives. These are just some of the numbers that shame Qatar\u2019s shiny new stadiums and the 22nd edition of the World Cup:\n$200bn\nAmount Qatar is reported to have spent on getting the World Cup ready, compared with around $11bn spent by Russia in 2018.\n0\nNumber of human rights clauses or conditions concerning labour protections requested by Fifa of the Qatari authorities when awarding hosting rights in 2010.\n3\nOfficial number of worker deaths during World Cup 2022 preparations, according to the Qataris and Infantino. Nicholas McGeehan of human rights organisation Fair Square calls that number a \u201cwilful attempt to mislead\u201d as it focuses on projects that account for only 1% of construction in Qatar. The Supreme Committee says that a further 36 workers from stadium sites also died, but for \u201cnon-work\u201d reasons \u2013 ie, they died after a day\u2019s work due to \u201cnatural causes\u201d.\n\n???\nThe exact number of migrant workers who have died as a result of negligence on projects linked to the World Cup. The real number will never be known. According to Human Rights Watch \u201cQatari authorities have failed to investigate the causes of deaths of thousands of migrant workers, many of which are attributed to \u2018natural causes\u2019.\u201d HRW also found that, in such cases, families seldom receive compensation for deaths because, under Qatari labour law, deaths not considered work-related are not entitled to compensation.\n6,500\nMigrant workers from India, Pakistan, Nepal, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka reported by the Guardian to have died in Qatar between 2010, when it was awarded the tournament, and 2021.\n200\nNepali worker deaths due to heat in Qatar, according to a 2019 study in the journal Cardiology that found a correlation, concluding that \u201cas many as 200 of the 571 cardiovascular deaths [of Nepali workers] during 2009-17 could have been prevented\u201d with effective heat protection measures. \u201cWe know workers are undergoing medical assessments before leaving their home countries and upon arrival,\u201d says Isobel Archer, of the Business &amp; Human Rights Resource Centre. \u201cThey\u2019re deemed to be fit and healthy, yet we know there have been many, many deaths among previously fit and healthy young men on such a scale that it would be astonishing in any other context.\u201d\n\n100,000\nMinimum figure for number of migrant workers Amnesty International consider to have been exploited and suffered abuse because of lax labour laws and insufficient access to justice in Qatar in the past 12 years.\n14-18\nHours worked a day by many migrant workers in Qatar, particularly in the domestic and security sectors, according to Amnesty. A recent report by Equidem found many similar stories, including from a Kenyan worker who described working 14-hour days at the Lusail Stadium without paid overtime for more than two years.\n\u00a3225\nLegal minimum wage a month in Qatar (1,000 riyals), the equivalent of about \u00a31 an hour, although food and accommodation are provided. In recent years, the authorities have introduced a number of labour reforms, including the introduction of a minimum wage and the abolition of the kafala, or sponsorship, system. However, human rights groups say it has been piecemeal and many abuses still take place.\n\n1,300\u20133,000\nRange in dollars paid as a recruitment fee by some migrant workers from India, Bangladesh, Nepal and elsewhere seeking work in Qatar. While this is now illegal, many workers are still struggling to repay their recruitment fees, and associated debts, and send money to their families.\n119\nQatar\u2019s rating, out of 180 countries, on the Reporters Without Borders press freedom index. That makes it one of the better countries in the region, however reporters have still been warned by human rights groups that they are likely to face surveillance at the World Cup.\n7\nYears in prison that men and women who have sexual relations outside marriage can face under 281 article of the penal code. HRW say this disproportionately affects women, who have been prosecuted if they report rape. It says \u201cpolice often do not believe women who report such violence, instead believing the men who claim it was consensual, and any evidence or suggestion that a woman knew the male offender has been enough to prosecute the woman\u201d.\n11\nCases of ill-treatment in detention for lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender people between 2019 and 2022, according to a report by HRW in October 2022. It said that Qatar Preventive Security Department forces have arbitrarily arrested LGBT people and subjected them to ill-treatment in detention including six cases of \u201csevere and repeated beatings and five cases of sexual harassment in police custody between 2019 and 2022\u201d. As a requirement for their release, security forces mandated that transgender women detainees attend conversion therapy sessions at a government facility. According to the authorities, however, there are no gay \u201cconversion\u201d centres in Qatar.\n\n5\nPossible number of years\u2019 imprisonment under article 296 of Qatar\u2019s penal code for \u201cleading, instigating or seducing a male in any way to commit sodomy or dissipation\u201d and \u201cinducing or seducing a male in any way to commit illegal or immoral actions\u201d.\n$440m \nAmount Amnesty and others believe Fifa should make available to help compensate migrant workers who have died or suffered injury in Qatar. That is equivalent to the World Cup\u2019s prize money. However, Qatar\u2019s labour minister has rejected such proposals, claiming criticism of the government counts as \u201cracist\u201d. The minister, Ali bin Samikh al-Marri, told AFP there was \u201cno criteria to establish these funds,\u201d and asked: \u201cWhere are the victims? Do you have names of the victims? How can you get these numbers?\u201d\n"

Giant banners declaring \u201cBoycott Qatar 2022\u201d have been a familiar sight at European grounds for months.\nHosting the World Cup has put an unprecedented spotlight on Qatar\u2019s human rights record. Reports suggest migrant workers who constructed stadiums endured \u201cpersistent and widespread labour rights violations\u201d. According to Guardian analysis, about 6,500 migrant workers have died since Fifa members voted in 2010 to award the 2022 tournament to the Gulf state.\nA recent survey found six out of 10 British people believe Qatar\u2019s stance on gay rights \u2013 homosexuality is illegal, attracting punishments of up to seven years in prison \u2013 should have barred it from hosting. This week an ambassador for the tournament described homosexuality as \u201cdamage in the mind\u201d.\n\nOn Wednesday Di Cunningham, the co-founder of the Three Lions Pride group, said no one from the England-based group would go to Qatar because there was \u201cno sign \u2026 of any appetite to relax or review the toxic environment there is for LGBTQ+ and other minority groups\u201d.\n\nSandra Tyrie, the manager of the Liverpool Arms pub in Chester, said it had decided not to show any matches \u2013 and since the decision others have followed suit. \u201cWe spoke to our customers and we just felt promoting it wasn\u2019t doing any good for our community,\u201d she says. \u201cWe just wanted to use the small voice we\u2019ve got to speak out.\u201d\nBut despite pleas to all competing nations from the president of Fifa, Gianni Infantino, to \u201clet football take the stage\u201d in Qatar, and keep quiet about politics \u2013 many are refusing to toe the line.\nOn Thursday, the England manager, Gareth Southgate, said it was \u201chighly unlikely\u201d England would comply, while the Football Association has announced the England captain, Harry Kane, will wear a OneLove armband in Qatar. \u201cWe stand for inclusivity, and we\u2019re very, very strong on that,\u201d said Southgate.\nOthers who will travel to the country are deciding to use the opportunity to try to open debate in a place where freedom of speech is stymied. The BBC pundit and former footballer Pat Nevin said like others travelling to cover the tournament he would keep his \u201ceyes and ears open\u201d, adding: \u201cThose of us who come from countries with allegedly free speech, we will not be quiet and we will say what we feel.\u201d\nBilly Grant, the co-presenter of Brentford FC\u2019s Beesotted podcast and a travelling England fan since 1990, said many supporters were staying at home. Some were doing so because of costs and the timing of the tournament, which was rescheduled for winter to avoid Qatar\u2019s overwhelming summer heat, others such as a gay friend from America said they did not feel safe.\n\nBut Grant said the tournament was also an opportunity for cultural exchange. \u201cWhen you start talking with locals you have more of an opportunity to change things than anybody can do at home,\u201d he says. \u201cWe know this is sports washing \u2013 but while switching off the football and watching Coronation Street might make you feel better, it\u2019s not going to change anything.\u201d\nPayne agrees, and says many fans who are travelling will \u2013 respectfully \u2013 be speaking their minds, maybe even from the stands. His ambition is to start a new chant, based on the chorus of the 1978 song by the Tom Robinson Band: (Sing If You\u2019re) Glad to Be Gay. \u201cIf I can get some of the boys to start it, then you never know if it will catch on,\u201d he says. \u201cWatch and listen to this space.\u201d"

It is thought unlikely that many teams will take up such offers but managers such as Gareth Southgate could provide half-time insight in Qatar. The \u201cflash\u201d interviews are not compulsory and have to be mutually agreed by the media rights licensee, such as the BBC or ITV, and the respective teams. Interviews will take place at the beginning or end of the half-time break if the host broadcaster submits a request in advance and the manager or assistant manager agrees to do so. In August the Crystal Palace manager Patrick Vieira became the first Premier League manager to take part in a half-time interview, speaking to Sky Sports before the start of the second half of the season\u2019s curtain-raiser with Arsenal. A change in the league rules in the summer means the UK broadcaster can request to speak to the manager or a member of coaching staff of either team before the game restarts. On Tuesday Amazon Prime interviewed the Newcastle manager, Eddie Howe, at half-time during his side\u2019s 1-0 win over Everton."

I\u2019ll be back for more red-hot World Cup blog action tomorrow so see you then.\n\n\n\n 5.03pm  \n\nThanks for the email, Santiago, and good luck for the final \u2013 not that you need it if you will be celebrating no matter the result.\nI think it\u2019s clear that France are stronger as a squad, and man-for-man, than Argentina. But the idea that Messi\u2019s genius can drag Argentina to a World Cup and emulate Diego Maradona, while increasingly well-worn in the past few weeks, is certainly a seductive one.\n\n\n\n 5.01pm  \n\n\u201cRe: the two semi-finals: both very good games in my opinion,\u201d emails Santiago. \u201cWhich went to show the strengths and weaknesses of all four teams. Both Argentina and France got somewhat \u201clucky\u201d, I guess, but my take is that they both know how to capitalise on their \u201cluck\u201d - particularly France \u2026\n\u201cThat being said, most of the French team has played this tournament in second gear (or, as Tom pointed out, they\u2019ve never looked \u201crattled\u201d, as opposed to Argentina, which except for the game against Croatia, has suffered almost every single minute of every single game), which makes me think that it\u2019s either because: a) that\u2019s actually their full capacity or b) they haven\u2019t had to bother to do more than what at times looks like the bare minimum. I\u2019m hoping the game on Sunday will finally show us which one it is.\n\u201cAll things considered, I\u2019m lucky enough to have a dual French-Argentinian citizenship, so I think I\u2019ll be celebrating no matter what - but I do feel (Messi\u2019s epic narrative aside, and Alvarez\u2019s second goal against Croatia case in point) that the Argentinian team has been playing like they want it more - although that, of course, is not how football works \u2026\n\u201cFingers crossed for a great final \u2026\nP.S. Argentina\u2019s relationship with Maradona is a very complicated matter. Books could (and definitely should) be written about it. But I think that, overall, in Argentina he\u2019s mostly loved. For Argentinians abroad, it might be slightly different. He\u2019s still the best ever, mind you.\nP.P.S The song is definitely not what I would call \u201cgreat\u201d, but it has hit Spotify No 1 in Argentina:\n\n\nUpdated at 5.01pm GMT\n\n\n 4.56pm  \n\nWe\u2019re wrapping this up shortly, so here is a reminder of today\u2019s World Cup content:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 4.53pm  \n\nContinuing the photographic theme \u2013 boats with Argentina and France flags in Doha today:\n\n\n\n\n 4.50pm  \n\nArgentina are training as we speak. Here are some photos:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 4.31pm  \n\nAt times it was even tempting to ask a ridiculous question: are France, defending world champions, slight favourites going into Sunday\u2019s final with Lionel Messi\u2019s Argentina, actually any good? Is someone going to work them out? Is Lionel Scaloni going to expose Didier Deschamps as a pragmatic fraud?\n\n\n\n\n 4.25pm  \n\nI\u2019m considering firing up the laptop when I finish work and watching France 2-1 England again, just to check if I remember it correctly. Bad idea?\n\n\n\n 4.16pm  \n\nFollowing on from that excellent Mbapp\u00e9 track, who remembers the ITV theme for the 1986 World Cup in Mexico? It\u2019s one of the first pieces of vinyl I ever bought, and I still have it somewhere.\n\nIt\u2019s available to purchase for a cool \u00a31.30 on Discogs, if you like that sort of thing.\n\nUpdated at 4.17pm GMT\n\n\n 4.13pm  \n\nWant more Qatar World Cup content? You\u2019ve got it. Will Unwin and John Brewin pick out seven breakout stars from the 2022 tournament:\n\n\n\n\n 4.08pm  \n\nSo here\u2019s a random World Cup-related story. I was in a restaurant in Rome in August with my girlfriend, and we got chatting to the waitress who was Argentinian. I asked her if she\u2019d ever been to see the Maradona mural in Naples. She made a face as if to say \u2013 \u2018Why would I do that?\u2019 \u2013 and we spoke about Maradona. She explained that as someone born in the mid-90s, all she really associated Maradona with was the drug problems, health problems, personal problems etc.\nShe went so far as to say she is sorry that many people around the world think of Maradona as synonymous with Argentina, as she and many other people certainly don\u2019t see him as a hero or any kind of role model. Food for thought, for football fans like me, who previously sort of assumed he was a hero to all in Argentina.\n\nUpdated at 4.09pm GMT\n\n\n 3.57pm  \n\nHave you ever wanted to watch Zinedene Zidane headbutt Marco Materazzi in the 2006 final, via \u2018tactical camera\u2019? You can do so here on fifa.com.\n\nUpdated at 3.59pm GMT\n\n\n 3.48pm  \nPoland's Szymon Marciniak to referee final\n\nAlthough I can\u2019t currently find confirmation from Fifa, it\u2019s being widely reported that Szymon Marciniak of Poland will referee the final between Argentina and France on Sunday. It willl be the first time a Polish referee has taken charge of the final.\nMore as we get it \u2026\n\n\nUpdated at 3.53pm GMT\n\n\n 3.40pm  \n\n\u201cI was listening to 6Music on Saturday and Gilles Peterson was playing a lot of French music,\u201d emails Michael Gaff. \u201cAnd he played this gem about Mbapp\u00e9.\u201d\n\n \u201cBravo Kylian, Kylian Mbapp\u00e9, fais nous r\u00eaver / (Bravo Kylian, Kylian Mbapp\u00e9, make us dream) \u2026 Bravo Kylian, Kylian Mbapp\u00e9, fais nous danser / (Well done Kylian, Kylian Mbapp\u00e9, make us dance).\u201d\nThat\u2019s really good. Thanks for sending, Michael.\n\n\n\n 3.28pm  \n\n\u201cKari makes some great points around that zona mista approach,\u201d emails David Neilson. \u201cBut what happened last night was magnetic Mbapp\u00e9. He had seven Maroc players trying to stop him when the first goal happened and five for the second. Both times the Mbapp\u00e9 shot was partially blocked and the ball skiffed off to the unmarked French scorers.\u201d\n\n\nUpdated at 3.35pm GMT\n\n\n 3.26pm  \n\nEric\u2019s mention below of the noughties France side reminds me of the time I saw France play Australia in Melbourne in 2001. I was living and working over there at the time. I even bumped into Patrick Vieira and Nicolas Anelka on Collins Street.\nFrance flew all the way across the world, you may remember, for a \u2018friendly\u2019 against the Socceroos, who were preparing to play Uruguay in a playoff for the 2002 World Cup. Kevin Muscat committed a horrible foul on Christophe Dugarry in a 1-1 draw, prompting the France manager Roger Lemerre to say: \u201cFootball isn\u2019t a game of skittles. What happened to Dugarry is something I regret bitterly \u2026 It was a close match and it should not have been tarnished with such an act of brutality.\u201d\nAustralia went on to lose the playoff against Uruguay. Ah, memories.\nIncidentally, as demonstrated by this Guardian story from the time, Ars\u00e8ne Wenger was NOT happy at losing Patrick Vieira, Thierry Henry, Robert Pires and Sylvain Wiltord for a mid-season friendly match on the other side of the globe. Just imagine a World Cup in November/December, Ars\u00e8ne!\n\n\nUpdated at 3.33pm GMT\n\n\n 3.18pm  \n\nEric Devin is here with an ode to Hugo Lloris:\n\u201cWe\u2019ve sung the praises of Kylian Mbapp\u00e9, and his sublime technical ability made all the difference against Morocco, even if his doggedness did not show up on the scoresheet. We\u2019ve sung the praises of Antoine Griezmann, and he turned in another man-of-the-match performance, seemingly appearing everywhere at both ends of the pitch, his industry key in setting up the opening goal. It was almost as if Adrien Rabiot\u2019s absence in midfield through illness was urging Griezmann on to a higher level of excellence. He facilitated the attack while also adding some experience to help the callow pair of Ibrahima Konat\u00e9 and Youssouf Fofana, who were in the team in place of Rabiot and Dayot Upamecano.\n\u201cBut while assaying France\u2019s stalwarts \u2013 including Olivier Giroud and Raph\u00e4el Varane \u2013 we\u2019ve given scant mention to Hugo Lloris. The France and Tottenham goalkeeper has come a long way since he made his international debut in 2008, lining up alongside Nicolas Anelka, William Gallas, Thierry Henry and Patrick Vieira in a goalless draw against Uruguay. Steve Savidan and Jimmy Briand came off the bench in that match, a retro evocation of French football of the early-2000s, a world away from the present. The grim reality was that Raymond Domenech had overstayed his welcome and was truly a spent force by that point \u2013 a manager caught between generations in terms of talent while also hamstrung by his own superstitions.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n 3.11pm  \n\nA bit more news here, from those busy people at Reuters:\n\u201cReal Madrid have reached an agreement to sign Brazilian teenage prodigy Endrick from Palmeiras, the clubs announced on Thursday. The 16-year-old forward will join the European and Spanish champions in July 2024, due to Fifa\u2019s rules prohibiting underage players from playing abroad.\n\u201cPalmeiras and Real Madrid did not disclose the length of the contract but confirmed that the player will be visiting the club\u2019s facilities in Spain next week.\u201d\n\n\nUpdated at 3.13pm GMT\n\n\n 3.09pm  \n\nThank you Tom. Hi again everyone.\nHere\u2019s an email from K\u00e1ri Tulinius that came in while I was having luncheon, further to our previous discussion about France\u2019s defensive discipline:\n\u201cI think you and Amar both make excellent points about Deschamps\u2019 defensive rigor as a consequence of his tactical upbringing as a player. But I think offensively, too, you can see traces of his past at Juventus. The unique thing about France in recent years is their asymmetry, they tend to be more adventurous down the left, and more solid on the right. In this way they\u2019re descended from the lopsided Italian teams of the mid-seventies through the mid-nineties, a style called \u2018zona mista\u2019, developed by Trappatoni at Juve, among others.\n\u201cThose teams tended to push up on one side, forcing defences to put bodies to that side of the field, which then creates space to exploit on the other wing. And then if the defences respond to cover that other flank, space opens up again. Hernandez had all the time in the world to score yesterday because Hakimi and other defenders rushed towards danger on the other side, leaving him free.\u201d\n\nUpdated at 3.10pm GMT\n\n\n 3.04pm  \n\nRight, Luke has returned, nourished, and can talk you through the rest of the day, as Argentina begin their media-saturated evening training session at Qatar University. Thanks for your emails. Catch you later.\n\n\n\n 2.59pm  \n\nI stand corrected. Thanks to Juan Aliau for pointing out that in 1978 both finalists, Argentina and the Netherlands, also lost group games. How could I forget?\n\n\n\n\n 2.56pm  \n\n\u201cOn the question of luck,\u201d muses Oliver Dungey, \u201cI\u2019d like to see it used as a metric to separate teams at the end of the group stage, after points, goal difference, and goals scored. If we define luck as a random outcome that is unintended then perhaps we could point to deflections that lead to goals as the key metric. Croatia\u2019s goal against Brazil, for example, would have earned them 2 \u2018luck points\u2019, while France\u2019s two extremely helpful deflections for their goals last night, being indirect, would generate 1 \u2018luck point\u2019 apiece. But then we get to a thorny philosophical question: would we prefer teams with good luck to progress or would those with bad luck deserve it more? Being a slightly embittered soul, I\u2019d go for the latter. And we\u2019ll need a better term than \u2018luck point\u2019 too - a \u2018Deschamps\u2019, perhaps?\u201d\nFootball without luck, flukes, undeserved wins and losses and random unscriptedness in general would be absolutely rubbish and not worth following.\n\n\n\n 2.42pm  \n\nMore fun with facts: This is the first World Cup in which both finalists have lost a game en route to the final. In the past there\u2019s been winners who have (West Germany 1954 and 1974, Spain in 2010), and runners-up who have (Czechoslovakia 1962, West Germany 1982, Argentina 1990, Italy 1994, Brazil 1998) but never both. Until now.\n\nUpdated at 2.42pm GMT\n\n\n 2.10pm  \n\nThanks Luke. And here\u2019s some Argentina talk, with Reuters reporting that \u00c1ngel Di Mar\u00eda is expected to be fit for Sunday\u2019s final. He and Lionel Messi are the only two Argentina players who were also in the squad that lost the 2014 World Cup final against Germany in Brazil. Would be interesting to see what role Di Mar\u00eda might play, with Julian \u00c1lvarez and Messi having really hit their strides in his absence. Argentina will also have the defenders Gonzalo Montiel and Marcos Acuna back; they\u2019re less depleted than France, who of course went into this tournament deprived of their top striker and key midfielders.\n\n\n\n 2.00pm  \n\nI am heading off for a bit of lunch \u2013 Tom Davies is on hand to guide you through the next bit. \n\n\n\n 1.53pm  \n\nThe Premier League restarts in *checks notes* 11 days\u2019 time, on Boxing Day, as we call it in the UK. We can get back to top-flight domestic action and perhaps pretend that this bizarre World Cup never happened.\nBack to good old summer World Cups from 2026, then, although of course Fifa are going to inject their cash cow with steroids and make it a 48-team tournament. Here, Jonathan Wilson considers how Fifa might make that new enlarged format a success:\n\n\nUpdated at 1.54pm GMT\n\n\n 1.41pm  \n\nThere is also a parallel between with Deschamps\u2019 France and Pep Guardiola\u2019s great Barcelona sides. Guardiola said he spent far more time thinking about what his team without the ball than with it. As you say, when you have world-class attacking players you can to a large extent trust them to do their thing \u2013 if you get the defensive side of things correct. That of course includes defending from the front, snapping the team back into shape when you lose possession.\nAn example would be Thierry Henry saying he\u2019d never worked harder than when he signed for Barcelona because he was expected to do his defensive duty, whereas at Arsenal he had been afforded the luxury of wandering back at a leisurely pace if an attack broke down.\n\nUpdated at 1.43pm GMT\n\n\n 1.38pm  \n\n\u201cAgree with you that a lot of what\u2019s being said about Deschamps is missing the mark,\u201d emails Amar. \u201cTo understand Deschamps, you need to look at his formative influences. He was the captain of the first French team (Marseille) to win a Champions League trophy in 1993, and the captain of the first French team to win a World Cup in 1998. The architect of the Marseille win was Raymond \u201cla Science\u201d Goethals, whose insistence on tactical rigour, discipline and resilience helped them overcome a Milan side that was Europe\u2019s dominant footballing force.\n\u201cArguably, similar qualities plus Zidane\u2019s genius, helped Aim\u00e9 Jacquet\u2019s France side win in 1998. Jacquet, a humble, no-nonsense man, moreover, had dropped Cantona from the side, because of his perceived lack of tactical rigour. Cantona famously derided Deschamps as a \u201cwater carrier\u201d. Well, the said \u201cwater carrier\u201d has it seems relentlessly applied the lessons learnt in those early years. His strength has been to alloy resilience and rigour to France\u2019s seeming unending ability to produce large numbers of world-class players, plus the X-factor types like Mbapp\u00e9 (now) and Zidane (back then).\u201d\n\n\nUpdated at 1.45pm GMT\n\n\n 1.34pm  \n\nI enjoyed this tweet from Ian King last night, about how weaknesses in all the teams in the competition emerge as it unfolds, after plenty of pre-tournament hype.\n\nHaving said that, as stated, I don\u2019t buy the idea that France have been \u2018lucky\u2019 as many seem to suggest. Yes I suppose Kane missing that pen was a stroke of luck, but who\u2019s to say France wouldn\u2019t have found a way to win anyway? I fancy they would have done.\n\n\n\n 1.29pm  \n\nJohn Brewin is here with World Cup Football Daily, looking ahead to Argentina v France:\n\n\n\n\n 1.21pm  \n\nTough times for the sports minister in Belarus. Alexander Lukashenko, the president, has given his sports tsar a public dressing down for the fact that Belarus failed to qualify for the World Cup.\nThey are in fact \u201cnowhere near\u201d, as Lukashenko says. (Belarus were in Group E with Wales and finished bottom, also below group winners Belgium, Czech Republic and Estonia).\n\nIf I was the sports minister I might have pointed out that the European champions Italy also failed to qualify.\n\nUpdated at 1.24pm GMT\n\n\n 1.02pm  \n\nIt was a job so comprehensive, so thoroughly performed to the letter, that France\u2019s players converted it to song. \u201cN\u2019Golo Kant\u00e9, he\u2019s short, he\u2019s nice, he shut down Leo Messi but we all know he\u2019s a cheater,\u201d went the lyrics after their midfielder, detailed to smother Argentina\u2019s No 10 in Kazan four years ago, barely allowed him a sniff. Messi was given little more than an assist for Sergio Ag\u00fcero\u2019s late consolation; he would finish the afternoon gazing at his feet and suspecting a dream had gone up in smoke, while France sailed through to the quarter-finals and far beyond.\nThe reference to deception? Kant\u00e9\u2019s teammates had a running gag, not entirely based on fiction as he later admitted, that he cheated at cards. But they will need a joker of their own at the World Cup final, because their tried and tested recipe for success is unavailable.\n\n\n\n\n 1.01pm  \n\nAlleged corruption news.

Coach Walid Regragui also became the first Arab manager to lead a team to the knockout rounds.\nThe two sides had met in their opening Group F match and played out a goalless draw.\nCroatia, runners-up in 2018, have played a third-place playoff once before. In 1998 they beat Netherlands 2-1 to finish third in that World Cup.\nMorocco had not conceded a goal from an opposition player at the tournament before their semi-final defeat to defending world champions France.\nThe \u2018Atlas Lions\u2019 are short on defenders after losing Romain Saiss, Nayef Aguerd and Noussair Mazraoui to injury in their semi-final defeat.\n\nPrevious meetings: Croatia and Morocco have met twice before, including in this tournament\u2019s group stage. Their only previous meeting prior to the World Cup was in 1996 in the semi-final of the King Hassan II International Cup. The match ended in a 2-2 draw before Croatia won 7-6 on penalties.\n\nUpdated at 4.01pm GMT\n\n\n 12.50pm  \n\nDarryl has emailed, drawing attention to Lionel Messi\u2019s Saudi Arabia deal. Here\u2019s a piece on that from a few months back:\n\n\n\n\n 12.49pm  \n\nSpeaking of podcasts, I remember listening to a (non-Guardian) podcast after France won the Cup in 2018, when someone (can\u2019t remember who) described Deschamps as \u2018an analog coach in a digital world\u2019. It seemed like a ludicrous claim at the time. It sounds even more ludicrous now.\nIf you\u2019re out there and reading this, mystery podcaster, please do email me to explain yourself.\n\nUpdated at 12.51pm GMT\n\n\n 12.45pm  \n\nIf you missed it \u2013 the post-France v Morocco Football Daily podcast is right here. Listen!\n\n\n\n\n 12.40pm  \n\n\u201cA bizarre question,\u201d emails someone called et k. \u201cCan you rank these World Cup performances, from the best to the ... less best. Messi 2022, Mbappe 2018, Forlan 2010, Zidane 2006, Ronaldo fenomeno 2002, Baggio 94, Maradona 1986.\u201d\nNo I can\u2019t. Comparison is the thief of joy, and all that.\nActually I can\u2019t resist one. Maradona 86 is obviously the best.\n\nUpdated at 12.42pm GMT\n\n\n 12.36pm  \n\nFrance did indeed endure a sticky spell in that first half against Poland. Piotr Zielinksi blasted that shot straight at Hugo Lloris instead of picking his spot and going for one of the corners. It might have been different \u2026\n\n\n\n 12.35pm  \n\nCourtesy of Reuters, here is a look at France\u2019s progress through the knockout rounds:\nLAST 16: FRANCE 3-1 POLAND \nAfter France went through a brief rough patch, Giroud opened the scoring to become France\u2019s all-time top scorer on 52 goals - moving one ahead of Thierry Henry. Les Bleus sealed it when Mbapp\u00e9 netted a couple of screamers - thumping the first shot under the bar before firing the second into the far top corner for his fourth and fifth goal of the tournament. Poland reduced the arrears with a stoppage-time Robert Lewandowski penalty. \nQUARTER-FINAL: ENGLAND 1-2 FRANCE \nFrance prevailed after a nerve-racking encounter. They went ahead thanks to a 25-metre Aur\u00e9lien Tchouam\u00e9ni strike, but cracked early in the second half with Harry Kane converting a penalty after a Tchouam\u00e9ni foul. Les Bleus appeared to be on the ropes at times, but they soaked up the pressure and made their experience count when Giroud\u2019s header from Griezmann\u2019s pin-point cross restored the advantage. \nKane had a golden chance to cancel it out with a late penalty, only for the striker\u2019s effort to fly over the bar. \u201cWe got a bit lucky although we gave away two penalties. We kept our lead with our hearts and our guts,\u201d said Deschamps. \nSEMI-FINAL: FRANCE 2-0 MOROCCO France abandoned possession early on, knowing too well that Morocco revelled in defending deep and looking to hurt their opponents on the break. They went ahead on five minutes thanks to Theo Hern\u00e1ndez\u2019s high-hooked volley, forcing their opponents to take the initiative. Morocco played boldly and would have deserved to level before the break. \nBut France defended with cool heads as Ubrahima Konat\u00e9 proved unbeatable at centre-back despite being named in the starting XI at the last minute following Dayot Upamecano\u2019s illness. Giroud could also have scored before the break but he hit the post in the 17th minute. It was all over in the 79th minute, however, when Randal Kolo Muani beat Yassine Bounou from close range after some great Mbapp\u00e9 work in the box, only 44 seconds after coming on as a substitute. France will play Argentina, who are also looking to win the World Cup for the third time, in Sunday\u2019s final at the Lusail Stadium. \n\n\n\n 12.19pm  \n\nKylian Mbapp\u00e9\u2019s tweet from last night is rocketing towards one million likes.\nImpressive social media reach.\n\n\n\n\n 12.16pm  \n\nFeel free to email me or contact me via Twitter with any World Cup musings.\n\n\n\n 12.11pm  \n\nThanks Tom and hello everyone.\nMy opening gambit with regards to last night\u2019s game, and to France\u2019s progress to the final, is as follows: The thing that really impresses me about the team under Deschamps is their discipline in keeping a rigid shape when out of possession. You can see how much work they put into this, and the result is that even when they are under pressure, they very rarely if ever get completely pulled out of position. \nAs a result, there is arguably nothing \u2018lucky\u2019 about the fact a defender always seems to be on hand to block a shot or make a clearance. It all stems from the defensive shape. Yes, they\u2019ve done a fair bit of \u2018last-ditch\u2019 defending, but their attack is obviously so potent they are usually capable of soaking up plenty of pressure and then causing damage on the counter.\n\nUpdated at 12.22pm GMT\n\n\n 12.02pm  \n\nRight, I\u2019m off for a break, and will leave you in the capable hands of Luke McLaughlin for a while. Catch you\u2019se later.\n\n\n\n 11.49am  \n\nI\u2019m minded to declare all GOAT correspondence closed, but You Lot Out There have made a couple of decent points. First up, Kari Tulinius on the bias towards attacking players in all such discussions:\n\u201cThe debate about who\u2019s the greatest footballer of all time is dominated by the same kind of player, creative attackers who score and create goals. Pel\u00e9, Maradona, Cruyff, Ronaldo, Zidane, Messi, Mbapp\u00e9 and the others who feature in these discussions are all, indeed, great, but theirs is the same sort of greatness. Defenders, non-attacking midfielders or indeed goalkeepers rarely enter the conversation. N\u2019Golo Kant\u00e9 and Fabio Cannavaro, to name just two, frequently did things that I had as hard a time explaining to myself as when I first saw a roulette. Football is a team game, and attacking is only a part of the sport. There can\u2019t be a GOAT because no one can excel at everything. Though the way Griezmann\u2019s been playing, I would only be mildly surprised if he scored a hat-trick in the final and then saved three penalties as a goalkeeper in the shootout.\u201d\nAnd here\u2019s Yash Gupta on how the game done changed:\n\u201cWhen there is a comparison for the greatest of all time, I\u2019d like to point out the often ignored - All the magical moments Messi has produced, if there was a player that I would bet my imaginary farm on, it would be Maradona. Take Messi vs Gvardiol for example. Gvardiol simply wipes out Messi if that match was played in 80s. And for as great Messi is, tackling was just a tiny bit different when Maradona played. Another point for Maradona would be he had his human moments and still feels much closer to heart even though I never watched him live. I was born long after he hung up his boots. There will never be another Diego Maradona in football.\u201d\n\n\n\n 11.37am  \n\nOne of the slightly tedious, even dispiriting, aspects of World Cups is how talk surrounding its breakout stars so quickly gets subsumed into chatter about which mega-rich clubs will pick them off, and the rumour mill never sleeps. So we\u2019ve got Manchester United being linked with Portugal\u2019s wonder kid Gon\u00e7alo Ramos, Leicester being linked with Azzedine Ounahi of Morocco and Angiers, and Real Madrid sniffing around PSV Eindhoven\u2019s Cody Gakpo.\n\n\n\n 11.26am  \n\n\u201cFor all the talk of France\u2019s \u2018clinical finishing\u2019 being the difference last night,\u201d writes Christopher Gibney, \u201cit\u2019s worth reflecting that both of their goals came from blocked shots turning into lucky assists, whereas for Morocco\u2019s numerous forays into the box the ball tended to break for defenders to clear. We rationalise these results in hindsight \u2013 talking about experience, and \u2018killer instinct\u2019 being the difference in tight games \u2013 but personally I think blind luck played a much bigger role last night. Given how they\u2019ve played, in Deschamps France seem to be demonstrating the wisdom of that famous Napoleonic preference for having lucky generals rather than a good ones.\u201d\nAnd yet they keep getting lucky. Morocco had plenty of forays, England had plenty of forays, so for that matter did Denmark and Poland against France. And yet France beat them all. There\u2019s a psychological aspect to all this too. France haven\u2019t played spectacularly in this tournament, have often been under pressure, but have never really looked rattled.\n\n\n\n 11.14am  \n\nA spot of English domestic news now, and Erik ten Hag has said he\u2019d be perfectly happy for Manchester United owners the Glazers to do one from Old Trafford. \u201cMy information is that it will only be good things because there will be more investment possible, which is good,\u201d said the United manager.\n\n\n\n\n 11.02am  \nCar hits and kills boy as fans celebrate France win\n\nSome horrible news from France, via AP:\n\nA car in the southern French city of Montpellier \u201cviolently hit\u201d and killed a boy as crowds celebrated France\u2019s victory in the World Cup semi-final, according to local regional authorities.\nThe driver fled the scene, but the vehicle was found nearby and police were investigating what might have caused the vehicle to strike the child, Herault authorities said.\nVideo emerged on Twitter showing a car being driven dangerously near crowds in the street following the French national team\u2019s Wednesday night win over Morocco.\nThe boy, whose name was not made public, was rushed to a hospital and died of his injuries. French media said he was 14 years old.French lawmaker Nathalie Oziol expressed her \u201cimmense sadness (that a) sporting event ends in absolute tragedy.\u201d\nElsewhere in France, crowds in Paris and other cities erupted in shouts of joy as France advanced to the World Cup final. The displays were relatively restrained. Disappointed Morocco fans mingled with the exuberant supporters of the winning team, paying tribute to the African country\u2019s unprecedented achievement.\nIn the capital of Belgium. about 100 people were detained late Wednesday after soccer fans shot fireworks at police and damaged cars in the center of Brussels, police spokesperson Ilse Van de Keere said.\n\n\n\n\n 10.48am  \n\nSome more correspondence: \u201cIf ever there was a scoreline 2-0 that did not reflect how close the game was, it was yesterday,\u201d writes V Krishnamoorthy. \u201cWhat Morocco lacked was big-game temperament and/or experience. France was clinical in the two chances they had. leaving aside the romanticism attached to the underdogs, Morocco was clearly the winner yesterday.\u201d\nYeah there were just a couple of occasions when their decision-making let them down when they got into France\u2019s penalty area but other than that their performance was crisp and fluent and very easy on the eye, giving the lie to nonsense comparisons in some quarters with the likes of Greece 2004. It\u2019s a bit of a bugbear of mine that \u201cunderdog\u201d teams are assumed to base their success on defensive anti-football, even though their styles vary as much as the \u201celite\u201d teams do. Morocco did need a bit more cutting edge but other than that they were one of the savviest tournament-football teams I\u2019ve seen for many a year.\nOn to France\u2019s opponents and Kurt Perleberg writes: \u201cI live in the US &amp; I want to see Argentina win the World Cup Final on Sunday so that Lionel Messi. who is on the Mount Rushmore of Soccer legends (along with Cristiano Ronaldo Diego Maradona &amp; Pele) can go riding off into the sunset of international soccer &amp; begin his last few years in this beautiful game at David Beckham\u2019s Inter Miami CF in Major League Soccer (MLS).\u201d \n\n\n\n 10.24am  \n\nFun with facts: Randal Kolo Muani\u2019s goal against Morocco last night means every number on the World Cup squad lists, from one to 26, has now featured on the scoresheet, PA Media tells us. \nEven more fascinatingly, Saturday\u2019s third-place play-off will be the second in a row contested by teams who\u2019d already met in the group stage \u2013 Belgium v England last time, Morocco v Croatia this.\n\n\n\n 10.03am  \n\nIt was lively in Paris last night, among fans of both teams, as Angelique Chrisafis reports:\n\n\n\n\n\n 9.55am  \n\nBlocking of ESL supported by legal opinion:\nHuzzah! (For now). Back to that legal wrangle, here\u2019s the verdict:\n\nUefa and Fifa\u2019s right to block new competitions like the European Super League is compatible with EU law, according to a key legal opinion published on Thursday.\nThe opinion of the Advocate General in the case, Athanasios Rantos, was read out on Thursday morning at the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg.\n\n\n\nUpdated at 9.59am GMT\n\n\n 9.52am  \n\nRichard Hirst gets in touch: \u201cIn the Daily Briefing Daniel Harris discusses whether Maradona or Messi is the GOAT, but comparing across eras is surely impossible, particularly because it is subject to the bias towards the recent, towards what we have seen for ourselves and can clearly remember.I didn\u2019t see Pele\u2019s first two World Cups, but I did see 1970, and to my mind, having said comparison is impossible, he is without doubt the greatest. That is subjective, but winning three World Cups isn\u2019t.\u201d\nIndeed, though what it takes to win three World Cups has also changed. But these debates don\u2019t throw up anything that can be clinically proven, so let\u2019s just enjoy Messi as we enjoyed Maradona and, for those who saw him, Pel\u00e9. Brilliant players are brilliant in different ways, just as eras vary. There\u2019s no need to rank them, fun though it may be.\n\n\n\n 9.40am  \n\nAway from the World Cup, one thing to look out for today is the legal opinion on the \u20acuropean $uoer \u00a3eague, as PA Media reports:\n\nA legal opinion due to be given today could shape the future direction of European football.\nThe European Court of Justice\u2019s Advocate General in the Super League court case is set to give his non-binding view on whether Uefa and Fifa abused a dominant position under EU competition law when they blocked the formation of the Super League in April last year, and in attempting to sanction those involved.\nIf Athanasios Rantos\u2019 opinion is that Uefa did abuse its position, and the final ruling of the court next year agrees with him, it opens the door for rival competition organisers to set up events outside Uefa\u2019s jurisdiction in the future.\nHowever, a ruling that backs Uefa\u2019s right to act as it did could kill off the threat of breakaway competitions for generations to come. \nThe opinion is initially set to be read out in court alongside other judgements and opinions from 8.30am this morning UK time, before a written version is published in full later in the day. In many previous cases the court judges\u2019 final ruling has closely mirrored the Advocate General\u2019s opinion, so it could provide a strong indication of the final outcome.\n\nWhatever the outcome, one fears the self-entitled ESL plotters won\u2019t take no for an answer.\n\n\n\n 9.30am  \n\nFor all the Messi v Mbapp\u00e9 talk, PSG aren\u2019t the best-represented club among the finalists\u2019 squads \u2013 that honour goes to Atl\u00e9tico Madrid, with Real Betis, Villarreal, Barcelona and Real Madrid also prominent. A wee pick-me-up for La Liga after a chastening tournament for Spain.\n\n\n\n\n 9.18am  \n\nSome Moroccan reaction, from their impressive coach, Walid Regragui, who understandably mixed pride and disappointment:\n\u201cWe knew we had achieved something great already and that everyone was proud of us. We are pleased with what we have done but felt we could have gone even further,\u201d he said. \u201cThose small details are what help real champions win and we saw that tonight. I told the players I was proud of them, his majesty is proud, the Moroccan people are proud, the whole world is proud. We worked hard, we were honest, and we showed the values we wanted to show.\u201d\n\nAnd as we\u2019re getting to the stage where people start composing their tournament XIs, I\u2019d have two, maybe three, Moroccans in contention \u2013 Ounahi, Hakimi and particularly the tireless Amrabat \u2013 you\u2019d love a player like that at your club wouldn\u2019t you. Boufal and Ziyech might also be in the reckoning.\n\n\n\n 9.09am  \n\nSome migrant worker news from Reuters, who report that more than three dozen Nepali civil society groups have called on the Fifa president, Gianni Infantino, to \u201cstop looking the other way\u201d while migrant workers are denied compensation after having \u201csuffered abuses in Qatar\u201d, Amnesty International said. \nAnd a reminder of yesterday\u2019s grim news:\n\n\n\n\n\n 8.29am  \nPreamble\n\nMorning everyone. So this still-tainted and still-basically-unjustifiable World Cup has nonetheless thrown up the juiciest of finals after France sealed a second consecutive final place with a 2-0 win over Morocco in what, for my money, was one of the games of the tournament, and one whose scoreline didn\u2019t reflect Morocco\u2019s sparkling contribution. But France have that air of a team destined to win even when they\u2019re not doing much, and in the reinvented Antoine Griezmann have perhaps the best player of these finals. The final is preposterously hard to call, with intriguing battles all over the place and certainly deserves more than to be reduced to a face-off between the two Qatar-employed superstars spearheading the respective sides\u2019 attacks.\nOur writers who were there have much to say about it all. So here\u2019s Jacob Steinberg posing the question as to whether France are any cop:\n\nBarney Ronay on that man Griezmann:\n\nDavid Hytner\u2019s match report:\n\nToday\u2019s Daily Briefing:\n\nAnd you can listen to Max and the crew chewing it over here:\n\n\nUpdated at 8.34am GMT\n"

                    "body": "Football fans enjoying a World Cup free of the usual bombardment of ads featuring top-flight players, celebrities and reality TV winners urging fans to go on a month-long gambling binge have Guy Parker to thank. As chief executive of the UK\u2019s advertising watchdog, Parker and his team are responsible for enforcing new regulations introduced just before the tournament in Qatar \u2013 a global event that gambling and betting companies traditionally target with a heavy marketing spend to attract bets from fans in the grip of football fever. The new rules prohibit famous figures with strong appeal to under-18s \u2013 from Cristiano Ronaldo and Jos\u00e9 Mourinho to England players and wider non-sporting celebrities \u2013 from appearing in betting and gambling ads in any media. \u201cIt is a big, big change that applies not only to footballers but to other sports people and celebrities,\u201d Parker says. \u201cIt is a serious rule change, and dangerous territory for gambling and betting firms now.\u201d  The 52-year-old is something of a lifer at the Advertising Standards Authority \u2013 he joined it 30 years ago as an investigations executive and has run the body since 2009. But do not mistake length of tenure for the possibility of a creeping complacency: last year was the busiest in the ASA\u2019s 60-year history, as the number of complaints about ads surged by a quarter to 43,325. Much of that surge related to Covid-themed ads. Tesco\u2019s \u201cvaccinated Santa\u201d topped the list in 2021, becoming the UK\u2019s second most complained-about ad of all time. Second on the list was Ryanair\u2019s ill-thought-out \u201cJab &amp; Go!\u201d holiday campaign. But the boom in digital advertising has brought a new challenge in the form of social media stars and platforms such as TikTok. Over the past year the authority has been waging war against a core of influencers who persist in ignoring warnings and a swath of bans designed to force them to make it clear when they are being paid to promote a product. \u201cLove Islanders in particular,\u201d Parker groans.  \u201cWe have seen much better compliance from influencers at the more professional end of the market,\u201d he says. \u201cThe class of influencers that are harder to get through to are the celebrities and contestants on reality TV shows, especially former contestants who have become famous but know their fame might not last very long, so want to make money while they can.\u201d While fame may be fleeting, complaints from the public are not. Last year, those related to influencer posts rose by a fifth and made up almost a quarter of all cases investigated by the ASA in the online sector. Former Love Islander Molly-Mae Hague has had three ad bans for not following social media marketing rules, and five other former contestants from the show have been part of an ASA \u201cname and shame\u201d campaign to highlight persistent rule-breakers to the public.  \u201cWe are fighting fire with fire,\u201d says Parker. \u201cUsing digital platforms to shine a spotlight on influencers who are not playing by the rules and drawing attention to people who follow and subscribe to them.\u201d  He says the tactic has seen recalcitrant influencers quickly toeing the line. It cost the ASA \u00a38.2m to investigate 22,155 cases last year \u2013 but then complaining is often said to be a national pastime in Britain. And though ad complaints are his organisation\u2019s raison d\u2019\u00eatre, Parker would like to hear less from the self-selecting bunch who contact the ASA most regularly, as they do not reflect the overall UK population. His figures show that Scots are the most likely to write in about ads, while residents of Wales and Northern Ireland will proportionately contact the watchdog less. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me they don\u2019t face the same sort of problem with irresponsible, misleading, harmful or offensive ads. They do, but for whatever reason they don\u2019t complain to the ASA,\u201d says Parker. \u201cIt is also maybe not surprising that better-off older people with maybe more time on their hands are more likely to take the time to fill in our online complaints form. We can\u2019t be in thrall to our complaints in-box, as this would mean over-servicing a small proportion of the UK public, and we can\u2019t afford to do that.\u201d  Parker\u2019s campaign against heedless influencers required many months of manual monitoring of 24,000 Instagram posts. With internet advertising having overtaken TV in 2014 to become the most complained-about medium, this time-consuming system was clearly unsustainable. The ASA has over the past year invested heavily in data science and machine-learning algorithms to tackle the ever-expanding task of keeping tabs on the online world even before complaints roll in. *** CV Age 52 Family Married with three children, and living in north London.

Biggest career mistake \u201cProbably enjoying working at the ASA too much \u2013 I\u2019ve been here 30 years!\u201d *** Parker now has his sights set on bringing into line sectors which to date have had a rather \u201cwild west\u201d approach to ad regulation. Earlier this year, the ASA sent enforcement notices to 50 firms in the cryptocurrency sector warning them that they must clearly explain the risks for potential investors. The watchdog has already slapped bans on a bitcoin firm for urging that it was \u201ctime to buy\u201d or miss out, and on football club Arsenal\u2019s campaign to get fans to buy its crypto \u201ctokens\u201d. \u201cWhen it comes to crypto advertising, we are the only game in town,\u201d says Parker. And this will be the case at least until the government delivers on plans to change the law so that ads for crypto assets are subject to the same regulation as other financial products.  Another area the ASA is wading into is companies\u2019 claims to being green, net zero or carbon neutral. Sectors it has launched investigations in include: transport, especially claims around hybrid and EV vehicles; food, in particular meat and dairy products; and energy. While such crackdowns are laudable, how does Parker feel about accusations that the ASA\u2019s policing role risks stifling Britain\u2019s globally recognised and admired advertising culture? \u201cNo, no,\u201d he says. \u201cWe love great advertising \u2013 if it is responsible.\u201d"

I can\u2019t guarantee there aren\u2019t some LGBT+ fans going, though I highly doubt it from the conversations I\u2019ve had.\u201d\nFootball has also been urged to do more by the LGB Alliance\u2019s Kate Barker, who said that some of its campaigns to support gay rights at the World Cup, such as captains of national teams wearing a OneLove armband, risked appearing \u201cperformative\u201d when there was still so much uncertainty over safety.\n\u201cThe fact homosexuality is illegal in Qatar means that it is a pretty precarious and dangerous to suggest that gay fans will definitely be safe without firm guarantees that is the case,\u201d she said.\nA similar warning was conveyed by the gay Liverpool fan Paul Amann, who visited Qatar for the Club World Championship in 2019. \u201cThe Qatari authorities have not delivered on anything that moves people towards a more inclusive World Cup,\u201d he said. \u201cIn fact, the activities of the state since my visit have clearly indicated a very hard line that will see LGBT+ people in real jeopardy if they attend.\u201d\nLiz Ward, director of programmes at Stonewall, said she was encouraged by the FA\u2019s stance. \u201cAs we approach the 2022 men\u2019s World Cup, we must remember that Qatar is a country where LGBTQ+ people are persecuted simply for being themselves,\u201d she said. \u201cSadly, this year\u2019s tournament is not safe for everyone, which is why it\u2019s so important to see Harry Kane, alongside many other captains, pledging to wear an anti-discrimination armband.\u201d\nThe German club Hoffenheim, who are fourth in the Bundesliga, have said they will not give any coverage to the World Cup because of the difficulty in providing what they describe as \u201curgently required analytical commentary contextualising the sporting events\u201d in the country.\n\u2022 This article was amended on 23 September 2022 because an earlier version misgendered Joe White."

                    "body": "Fears of England fans inadvertently provoking police during the World Cup have caused UK officials to send extra officers to Qatar to \u201cdeconflict\u201d situations.\nConcerns over cultural misunderstandings and preconceptions regarding the behaviour of travelling England fans means that, for the first time at an international tournament, British police will be sending \u201csupporter engagement officers\u201d (SEOs) to warn people if their behaviour is likely to be interpreted as problematic, even if they are not breaking any laws.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a World Cup in a very different part of the world with a very different culture,\u201d said chief constable Mark Roberts, England\u2019s national lead for football policing. \u201cOne of my fears is that supporters not wishing to cause problems may act in a way that inadvertently causes offence or draws attention. Equally there may be perceptions on the part of either Qatari police or the supporting Turkish police where there\u2019s this misapprehension of what supporters are doing.\u201d\nQatari organisers have drafted in thousands of officers from Turkish national police to control events outside World Cup stadiums, with police officers from Pakistan seconded to provide security and stewarding within grounds. Fans are expected to congregate in only a small number of locations within Doha, Qatar\u2019s capital, largely around one fan zone in the city\u2019s Corniche district, capable of holding up to 40,000 spectators.\nRoberts said SEOs would act a \u201cbuffer\u201d between supporters and law enforcement. \u201cThey will be engaging with supporters if we think there\u2019s a risk that they may be overstepping a mark as viewed by the locals,\u201d he said.\n\u201cOur first port of call will be for our officers to go over to them try to explain and try to deconflict. Equally if we think there\u2019s going to be an intervention by law enforcement, [SEOs] will be seeking to engage with that law enforcement, just calm it down and move people on, try to inject a sense of balance.\u201d\nRoberts said the suggestion of sending SEOs was made by UK police after planning events in the Gulf state and that the idea was welcomed by Qatari officials. However he said there remained uncertainty over how the operation will work.\n\u201cWe\u2019re all there as guests of the Qataris so it\u2019s their operation,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s all very encouraging, but I\u2019ve not got the benefit of English domestic teams playing Champions League games in Qatar for the last 20 years. So while I can say with confidence I know how the Germans do it I can\u2019t say that [in Qatar], because we\u2019ve not had the wealth of experience.\u201d\nThe English Football Association\u2019s head of security, Tony Conniford, said he expected a minimum of 3,000 English fans would attend the group matches, starting against Iran on 21 November. He asked police not to act on reputation when assessing the behaviour of England supporters.\n\u201cI feel like communication is the key to success of this tournament,\u201d Conniford said. \u201cIf fans are well-informed before they travel then I think they will respect and adhere to the culture we are going into. In every country I\u2019ve been into in recent years I\u2019ve asked that England fans are policed on the behaviour that\u2019s in front of them and not the reputation that precedes them. I sincerely hope that this will be the case on this occasion.\n\u201cIt is a completely new environment for us to travel to, one that has not staged a major football tournament before, and I think it will make for an exciting supporter experience. I\u2019d like to think that the [Qatari authorities] are ready, but I think we\u2019ll only find out once we get there.\u201d"

                    "body": "Roll up. Humans for sale. We will buy your labour. We will buy your joy too. We will buy your parping horn, your triumphalist songs. We will, let us make this clear, buy your feelings. So dance for us. Show your passion for the project (or lose its associated privileges). Because make no mistake: those tender feelings, the urge to feel and express pleasure, to interact with the spectacle, are now property of the state of Qatar. There is something genuinely jaw-dropping about the story that 40 England fans \u2013 including members of the England band \u2013 and 40 Wales fans are being paid by Qatar to attend this month\u2019s Fifa World Cup; a sense, common in the last few years, of reality starting to fray at the edges. According to a Times report, and a similar story in the Netherlands this week, the England and Wales fans, along with supporters from 30 other nations, have signed a code of conduct that requires them to deliver positive messages about being in Qatar, to sing songs as directed, and, perhaps most unsettlingly, to respond to social media posts critical of Qatar\u2019s World Cup.  In return the England band and their fellow Fan Leaders will receive flights, tickets, accommodation and \u00a360-a-day spending money. \u201cYou will be expected to stand up, sing the song/chant, wave your flags,\u201d Qatar\u2019s guidance states, adding in red letters: \u201cBe ready in your shirt, flags and scarves to cheer and shout.\u201d Just to be clear, that\u2019s shout. Not weep, or scream, or collapse into a slough of melancholy. There is a Great Depression-era novel called They Shoot Horses, Don\u2019t They?, set around a dance marathon competition on a pier in Santa Monica. In the book a group of young penniless people are paid to dance non-stop in public in return for food and a cash prize for the last couple left standing. Meanwhile paying customers can spectate on the dancers\u2019 agony and fatigue, their forced gaiety, their murderous existential crises while circling the floor. It is to be hoped a similar fate does not await the England band, out there trundling through their circular set-list, hands blistered and bloody as they creak out another rendition of the Great Escape, dreaming of vaulting their own barbed wire fences, trumpet nozzles slowly filling with tears and sweat and snot as the cameras pan back for one more cramp-ridden wave. Behold our migrant happiness workers, here to decorate the imperial show with their joy. It is of course all too easy to laugh at the England band. And yet I think we should still laugh at the England band, if only because laughter is an appropriately unforced human response. And really, you do wonder how this will play out in practice. Will Qatar\u2019s image massagers suggest an updated version of the usual playlist? No Surrender To The Global Zionist Hegemony, perhaps. A pre-match chorus of Ten British-Made RAF Joint-Squadron Typhoon Bombers. Please Don\u2019t Take Me Home, Because You\u2019ve Confiscated My Passport. Plus of course the classic Southgate You\u2019re The One, You Still Turn Me On (But Not, Repeat Not, In A Gay Way).  It is also tempting to wonder precisely how enthusiastic the faces of the contracted England fans need to look to remain within agreed parameters. How un-jubilant can you get, before your travel pass stops beeping on the metro? Plus of course, there is the obvious point that England\u2019s fan leaders have sold themselves for a disappointingly small amount of money. David Beckham got \u00a315m for his soul, although the Beckham soul does come with 75 million Instagram followers, a range of country-squire hats and the weary disappointment of anyone who thought it was cool when he went on the cover of Attitude magazine. Mainly we should also laugh at Qatar, because laughter is the opposite of the designed response, and may disincentivise the future purchasing of human feelings. And also because this whole process shows such a profound misunderstanding of how the PR is likely to work here in practice. Or does it? Step back a little and it is hard to avoid an echo of a wider and more disturbing process. The fact is, the band and their contracted co-fans should not be the ultimate target of our ridicule. To be fair to the Fan Leaders this may just have seemed like a good idea at the time. There\u2019s a cost of living crisis going on. Any kind of casual employment is welcome. Perhaps it was unclear how this would look and sound outside of their own echo chamber. In the end they are basically doing what everyone else is doing around this World Cup and the version of the world it represents, a place where the very rich and powerful are free to explore their mastery and control of the poor and the plentiful. So at the micro level we have the likes of Beckham, paid vast amounts of money to look fascinated in a faux spice market, all the while leasing out his public profile to the highest bidder; who isn\u2019t, it turns out, the marginalised groups he has previously advocated. Then at the far end we have the UK parliament, which has spent the last year parading on Qatar\u2019s behalf in its vulcanised rubber thong like never before. Forget the fans. This is where our scorn should be focused.   Last week the Observer revealed the Qatari government had made gifts to members of parliament worth \u00a3251,208 in the 12 months to October 2022, including stays at luxury hotels with \u201cvast swimming pools\u201d, business class travel on Qatar Airways and a private dinner with Qatari World Cup officials. By pure coincidence some of those MPs would later praise Qatar or advocate its interests in the house of commons. \u201cThere is no suggestion that any MP broke rules\u201d the Observer notes. OK then. So what does this tell us, exactly, about the rules? And in the end this clumsy piece of World Cup stage management is probably doing us a favour. The Times story called the paid England fans \u201cspies\u201d. They\u2019re not really. They\u2019re cheerleaders. But they are also giving us information. The paid fans are telling us in the boldest possible terms about the violently transactional forces at play around this World Cup. Big Sport is telling us that in the end everyone is for sale here, that humans and their feelings, their 8 billion-strong collective mass, are units of commerce out there. It is the sharpest point of the thing we call \u201csportswashing\u201d, humans literally being paid to dance and smile for the cameras in a stadium haunted by the ghosts of migrant workers. This same process applies too in the paid media, where for many outlets dissent has a financial penalty in clicks and subscribers. It\u2019s there too, just down from the band, in the tribe-like ultra-loyalty of some football supporters, backing their club-colours despotic regime, whichever one it might happen be. The ownership class will weaponise these emotions, from use as a soft power tool to wringing the last drop of cash from those unbreakable loyalties. And while the band deserve our ridicule, we are, to some degree, all marching to that same baleful tune."

The most divisive, brutal, mindbogglingly corrupt sporting event of the modern age is now upon us. It is time, finally, to Discover Amazing, as the Qatar 2022 Fifa men\u2019s World Cup repeatedly urges the passing traffic on the endless hoardings and fences ringing this city of light and sheer surfaces.\nOn Sunday evening the footballers of Ecuador and Qatar will walk out for the opening game at the Al Bayt stadium. Over the next 29 days Qatar\u2019s eight box-fresh arenas, gleaming glass and steel monuments to the men who died in their construction, will live out their own brief sepulchral lifespans before being dismantled for parts or converted into shopping malls.\nEngland play Iran on Monday in the mid-afternoon heat. Wales kick off against the USA in the evening. Twelve years, \u00a3220bn, and thousands of unexplained deaths in the making, it seems we really are going to play football after all. Welcome to the damned World Cup.\n\nIt has been a gruelling process to reach this point. Twelve years have passed since Fifa staged its preposterously grandiose double World Cup bid selection ceremony in Zurich. The former president Sepp Blatter appears to have genuinely believed he was going to win a Nobel Peace Prize by awarding 2018 and 2022 to Russia and the US. Instead, from the moment Blatter opened his envelope and read out the word \u201cQatar\u201d in a halting voice \u2013Blatter knew, even then \u2013 he lit a fuse under Fifa\u2019s own mountain bunker.\nLater that day, as a Cold War Steve-style montage of A-listers, from Boris Johnson to Bill Clinton, slunk back to their helicopters, Vladimir Putin appeared on stage in Zurich to offer up a triumphant unscheduled press conference. Fast forward to the present day and 16 of 22 voting Fifa committee members from that day have been tainted by some form of corruption, either alleged or founded, from arrests and extradition orders, to such minor oversights as accepting a Picasso painting from Russia\u2019s bid team and then really regretting it and saying sorry.\n\nThis is item one on the Qatar 2022 charge sheet, a World Cup that was basically awarded by a toxic criminal organisation. But it is just the backstory here. The suffering of the vast migrant labour force employed to build this tournament has been widely covered in the years since. A Guardian report has suggested there may have been up to 6,500 related worker deaths since Qatar was awarded the World Cup.\nQatar disputes this. For a long time it put the total as low as three. Qatar has also refused to carry out proper autopsies on its working dead. Various independent reports have pointed to cases of cardiac arrest due to crushingly long hours in the desert heat, to a workforce managed on the basis of ingrained institutional racism, and to some truly heartbreaking details. A story in the New York Times this week reported that at least 2,100 Nepalis have died in Qatar since 2010, 200 of them suicides.\nThere is a level of cognitive dissonance required to keep watching a spectacle haunted by these absences. The official mascot of Qatar 2022 is called La\u2019eeb, billed as a sprite from the mascot netherworld, and modelled on the traditional regional white cloth headdress. Basically La\u2019eeb flits about looking like a smiling friendly ghost, presented via hologram box to arrivals at Doha international airport in a way that feels unintentionally poignant. Here he is, the cheeky, ghostly face of a World Cup shadowed by death.\nThe question of why, exactly, Qatar wanted to stage this spectacle has perhaps not been asked enough. Qatar has no serious footballing culture. It had no infrastructure at the time, and is still ruinously expensive to visit.\nThe argument for expanding the game has been used by Fifa, as it was ahead of the murderously framed 1978 edition. And it is true that there is a huge hunger for football in the Middle East and the Gulf. A first ever World Cup in the European winter is hardly an unreasonable request from the rest of the world. But why not take this thing to a place where it can genuinely put down roots, to a developing nation where Fifa\u2019s vast wealth could be used to help build facilities that are actually needed?\nThe term sportswashing has been a handy, catch-all explainer, a term used to describe hard-line states using sport to burnish the public profile. This is of course nothing new. The Fifa World Cup has been the plaything of despots for as long as there has been a Fifa World Cup. Its second edition was staged in Benito Mussolini\u2019s Italy. Only the intervention of the second world war saved us from the great lost Nazi World Cup, Germany 42.\n\nThis is a little different. Qatar is not conducting a charm offensive. Qatar has no ambitions beyond its own borders. Qatar has 200 years of natural gas. It doesn\u2019t need to be liked. Instead this World Cup looks now like part of a wider national security programme, a way of making this tiny hyper-wealthy peninsula visible to the world, of becoming a presence on the map, of minimising its vulnerability to coups and blockades. This is hard power, security, the shifting plates of global wealth and influence.\nIndeed as the World Cup kicks off, and with Qatar\u2019s status elevated by Europe\u2019s energy crisis \u2013 the result of a war started by the host of the last World Cup \u2013 there has been a distinct hardening of attitudes, a sense Qatar really isn\u2019t in the mood to keep apologising.\nIt is hard to avoid the feeling that Qatar was right too, that it read the way the world was turning, that the disbelief at its announcement as hosts in 2010 has been followed by 12 years of gathering influence. And now we have this: a brutally stark end point to big football\u2019s reimagining of itself as a luxury propaganda tool.\nBut hey, Harry Kane is fit. Perhaps Gareth Southgate can be lured out of his keep and persuaded to play a back four instead of a back five. It could even end up being a pretty good tournament on the pitch. Brazil, France and Argentina are the favourites to win, all three crammed with high-end attacking talent. England are stodgy enough to go out in the group stage, but also good enough to edge their way right to the end. Wales will bring vibes, collectivism and the basking, late-stage Gareth Bale. The show will roll on. And the world will, as ever, be watching."

Amenities in each cabin include tea- and coffee-making facilities, two bottles of water per day, a fridge, bed linen and bathroom towels.\n\nThe World Cup is expected to attract 1.2m visitors, but by March Qatar had only 30,000 hotel rooms, 80% of which had been booked by Fifa for teams, officials and sponsors.\nThat has led to concerns among fans and a rush to make more accommodation available \u2013 including shared rooms in empty apartments, a cruise ship off the coast of Doha and traditional-style tents in the desert.\nThe Rawdat Al Jahhaniya accommodation is not the only fan site of which questions have been asked. On Thursday the Times spoke to two contractors who had spent 10 days at Ras Bu Fontas, which will host 6,000 football fans a day, and who raised concerns.\n\nOne told the newspaper: \u201cIt has been hell. The air con in the cabin barely works and sounds like a [fighter jet] is taking off. Even if you have it on all the time during the day it is still 27C. You can\u2019t have it on at night because it is so noisy.\u201d\nThe other described the cabins, which contain two single beds, in unflattering terms. \u201cThey are rock hard so you might as well sleep on the floor,\u201d he said. \u201cI have never been somewhere so uncomfortable. We have been here for 10 days and it is a nightmare. It might be OK if you want to rough it for a night or two, but any longer would be dreadful.\u201d\nThe Qatar organising committee declined to comment when contacted by the Guardian."

Thanks for your company and emails \u2013 gooddnight.   Updated at 6.24pm GMT    6.12pm    Tomorrow\u2019s games  England v Iran (1pm GMT) Senegal v Netherlands (4pm) USA v Wales (7pm)      6.10pm    Statgasm There were 11 shots in the entire game, which is apparently the joint lowest since folk started recording such things in 1966.     6.05pm    Here\u2019s Jim Waterson on the opening ceremony      6.04pm    \u201cUnder Tim Howard, the USMNT was a shining example of how with a crappy team, an awesome goalkeeper can save you from severe national embarrassment (to the maximum extent possible, i.e. not qualifying for Russia 2018 can never be forgotten), while also serving as a source of fierce pride,\u201d writes Liisa Sletzinger. \u201cI feel for Alsheeb. In other news, we\u2019ll see how tomorrow goes without Howard.\u201d Brad Friedel is still going strong though, right? I still have nightmares about his performance against Manchester United in 2004, and 2005, and 2006, and 2007, and 2008.     6.02pm    A bit of England news, because that\u2019s what we\u2019re here for. Fifa have apparently banned Harry Kane from wearing a OneLove armband, and the FA are trying to find out what punishment they will face if he does so. Chris Morris is really excelling himself here.   Updated at 6.04pm GMT    5.59pm   Full time: Qatar 0-2 Ecuador  Who needs a drink? That was a forgettable and slightly weird opening game, won emphatically by Ecuador. Enner Valencia scored both goals in the first half, the second a memorable header, and Qatar rarely looked like getting back in the game. Almoez Ali missed their only clear chance in first-half injury time.  Ecuador didn\u2019t need to score any more goals, so they didn\u2019t bother (although they might regret that if the group is decided by goal difference). Qatar become the first host team to lose the opening game of a World Cup, and the whole experience seems to have driven Jonathan Wilson to madness. Heeeeeeeere\u2019s Johnny!   Updated at 6.14pm GMT    5.59pm    90+5 min The substitute Rodriguez misses a half chance, heading Estupinan\u2019s corner well wide. I think he saw it late.     5.54pm    90+1 min There will be 12 years of added time.   Updated at 6.06pm GMT    5.54pm    90 min: Ecuador substitution Alan Franco and Kevin Rodriguez, replace Estrada and the ever excellent Caicedo.     5.51pm    87 min \u201cWhat sort of punishment should Qatari leaders receive for hosting a tournament for which they didn\u2019t had a proper team?\u201d wonders Yash Gupta. \u201cVIP seat in the next World Cup draw and maybe hosting a Champions League final looks plausible.\u201d   Updated at 5.54pm GMT    5.50pm    86 min: Just over from Muntari! That almost got things going. The substitute Muntari made a superb run onto a long, straight pass down the inside-right channel. The ball bounced up nicely on the edge of the area, and he struck a booming shot on the run that rippled the roof of the net.  Updated at 5.50pm GMT    5.49pm    86 min Ecuador break four on three, but Sarmiento overhits his through pass to Estrada.     5.49pm    85 min There\u2019s very little urgency from Qatar, who look happy with the relative dignity of a 2-0 defeat. In truth, the second half has been dreadful.     5.47pm    82 min Mendez goes down after a slight touch in the face from Waad. Plata curls the free-kick straight out of play.     5.46pm    82 min Sanchez throws his hands in disgust when Alsheeb hoofs the ball straight out of play. Qatar have been so disappointing.     5.45pm         5.43pm    79 min Sarmiento misses a great chance, wafting over from 10 yards, though it wouldn\u2019t have counted because somebody, Estupinan I think, was offside in the build up.     5.41pm    78 min Afif is booked for a poor tackle on Plata.   Updated at 5.48pm GMT    5.41pm    77 min \u201cSince half-time, Qatar\u2019s fullbacks have pushed further up the field, which has kept Ecuador\u2019s wingers from surging up the flanks,\u201d writes K\u00e1ri Tulinius. \u201cI think that\u2019s the main tactical reason for the differences between the two halves.\u201d     5.40pm    76 min: Ecuador substitution Enner Valencia, who scored both goals in the first half, is replaced by Jhon Cifuente.     5.40pm    76 min Enner Valencia is down again, holding his right knee. This time I\u2019m confident it\u2019s a genuine injury.      5.39pm    75 min Afif has a bit of time to line up a drive from 25 yards, but he swishes it high over the bar. He\u2019s been really disappointing.   Updated at 5.43pm GMT    5.38pm    74 min The Qatar coach Felix Sanchez has hand over his mouth, his eyes focussing on a point roughly 1,000 yards in the distance.      5.37pm    73 min Sarmieno is fouled on the left edge of the area by Miguel. Estupinan curls the free-kick towards the near post, Hatem heads clear.     5.35pm    71 min: Qatar substitution Mohammed Waad and Mohammed Muntari replace the captain Hassan Alhaydos and Almoez Ali, who missed Qatar\u2019s best chance on the stroke of half-time.     5.33pm    69 min There are two ways of looking at this non-event of a second half. One, that Qatar have restricted Ecuador to half chances; two, that Ecuador don\u2019t need any more goals and have played within themselves.  Updated at 5.34pm GMT    5.31pm    68 min: Ecuador substitution Brighton\u2019s Jeremy Sarmiento replaces the excellent Romario Ibarra in midfield.      5.30pm    66 min Nothing is happening on the field. Off it, on the other hand\u2026      5.29pm         5.28pm    64 min \u201cImagine having Infantino\u2019s confidence though,\u201d dreams Ian Copestake. \u201cI would definitely have landed that teaching job in Aberystwyth.\u201d     5.27pm    63 min Preciado is back on the field.     5.27pm    62 min Hassan drives an angled cross towards the far post, where Pedro Miguel gets in front of Estupinan and slams a good header back across goal that goes a few yards out. He was a long way out, almost Steve Nicol territory, so that was a decent effort.  Updated at 7.16pm GMT    5.25pm    61 min Preciado is off the field receiving treatment. He seemed to pull something when he booted the ball downfield.     5.25pm    60 min \u201cI am starting to feel sorry for the players of Qatar,\u201d says Mary Waltz. \u201cThey look shell shocked, as if their limbs are frozen.\u201d Yes, I suspect they are better than this. And they will be against Senegal when, after a minor change to Fifa\u2019s eligibility rules, Erling Haaland, Andy Robertson and Khvicha Kvaratskhelia make their World Cup debuts.  Updated at 5.27pm GMT    5.22pm    59 min Hatem is fortunate not to be booked for a hack at the impressive Plata.     5.21pm    57 min According to the Fifa possession stats, Ecuador lead 44-42.      5.20pm    56 min Mendez is booked for scraping his studs down Afif\u2019s shin.   Updated at 5.27pm GMT    5.19pm    55 min: Good save from Alsheeb! Ibarra cuts inside Bassam on the edge of the area and whips a curling shot that is pushed away by Alsheeb, diving to his left. It was a relatively comfortable stop.     5.17pm    53 min Plata shuffles past two players, keeps his balance despite being fouled and curls in a good cross that just evades both Estrada and Valencia in the middle.     5.16pm    53 min \u201cTV has just shown a close up of the most vocal Qatar fans,\u201d says Colin Stevens. \u201con\u2019t think I could see one woman amongst them.\u201d   Updated at 5.16pm GMT    5.16pm    52 min The right-back Preciado shoots from 30 yards, and blooters it into the crowd.     5.15pm    51 min Ibarra moves into the penalty box from the left but then underhits a relatively simple pass to someone (nope, not a clue) on the edge of the area.     5.14pm    50 min Nothing much is happening at the moment. These sides play again on Friday \u2013 Qatar against Senegal, Ecuador against Louis van Gaal\u2019s army.   Updated at 5.19pm GMT    5.13pm       Updated at 7.16pm GMT    5.12pm    49 min Qatar are having more of the ball at the start of the second half, though so far it\u2019s all been in front of the Ecuador defence.     5.11pm    47 min \u201cI rather like the \u2018in contest\u2019 possession stat, assuming it accounts for 50/50 balls and such,\u201d says Tracy Mohr. \u201cHowever, what on earth is \u2018offers to receive\u2019?\u201d A foreign language?     5.09pm    46 min Peep peep! Ecuador begin the second half.     5.09pm    The players are back out on the field, including Enner Valencia, whose knee injury mustn\u2019t be too bad.     5.08pm    \u201cChanging the fixtures and insisting on featuring in the showpiece opening game probably seemed a much better idea when the Qataris thought they wouldn\u2019t be played off the park,\u201d says David Wall.     5.07pm         4.58pm    \u201cIn addition to two goals, one disallowed goal and just about everything else so far,\u201d begins Dan Almond, \u201cEnner Valencia has also drawn three fouls from Qatar, each of which resulted in a yellow card. Surely no player will do more in 45 minutes of football in this tournament.\u201d     4.53pm   Half time: Qatar 0-2 Ecuador  There are some things money can\u2019t buy. The hosts Qatar have been completely outplayed by Ecuador, who lead through two goals from their captain Enner Valencia. The first was a penalty, the second a majestic header. He also had a goal ruled out for offside, a slightly confusing but ultimately correct decision. Qatar have looked very nervous, particularly their goalkeeper Saad Alsheeb. His opposite number, Hernan Galindez, hasn\u2019t had a save to make.     4.53pm    45+5 min: Chance for Qatar! Almoez Ali almost pulls one back with the last touch of the half. Hassan Alhaydos curled a brilliant first-time cross from the right, but the unmarked Ali steered a header well wide from six yards. Apparently that was Qatar\u2019s first touch in the Ecuador penalty area.  Updated at 5.00pm GMT    4.47pm    45 min Five minutes of added time, mainly for that first VAR check.     4.46pm    44 min Valencia is on his feet, though he\u2019s limping heavily.     4.45pm    43 min Valencia is down holding his knee. This doesn\u2019t look good \u2013 there was a hyper-extension after he challenged Boudiaf.   Updated at 4.50pm GMT    4.43pm    40 min Afif breaks promisingly down the left, but is easily dispossessed by Mendez. Qatar have been so meek on the ball.   Updated at 4.45pm GMT    4.41pm    40 min \u201cEnner Valencia is a left-footed strike away from a perfect hat trick in the opening match of a World Cup!\u201d coos Peter Oh. \u201cThe way he\u2019s tearing it up I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if he also scores with his chest and backside.\u201d A rear-Enner, as nobody will be calling it.     4.40pm    39 min I didn\u2019t expect Qatar to win the whole thing, but I didn\u2019t expect this either.      4.40pm    38 min \u201cIn this case the new possession stat is very much a good piece of progress,\u201d says Dan Naylor. \u201cThe old way of calculating possession is insanely bad. It\u2019s just if I had 300 passes and your team had 200 then my team would have had 60% of the possession. That could ignore one team just standing on the ball letting the clock run out, or making lots of slow lethargic passes around when they have the ball and are killing off the game, where some other team is being pressed early on makes lots of quick passes that eventually earn in a turnover.  \u201cThe real possession metric should be time on the ball and i think many people just assume that\u2019s what the possession stat is. That this is finally being rectified in 2022 is crazy but better late than never?\u201d Isn\u2019t this new method just more confusing?     4.38pm    36 min Karim Boudiaf is booked for a foul on Valencia.   Updated at 4.46pm GMT    4.37pm    34 min Here\u2019s that second goal.      4.35pm    GOAL GIVEN! Caicedo laid a simple ball back to Preciado, who swung a lovely first-time cross towards the far post. Valencia ran away from Pedro Miguel, strained his neck muscles and powered a brilliant downward header into the corner. Alsheeb had no chance.  Updated at 4.59pm GMT    4.34pm    VAR check \u2013 he might be offside.  Updated at 4.59pm GMT    4.33pm   GOAL! Qatar 0-2 Ecuador (Valencia 31)  Enner Valencia makes it 2-0 with a storming header!    Updated at 7.15pm GMT    4.31pm    29 min Ibarra wafts over from distance, then Caicedo is booked for a foul on Pedro Miguel. I think I missed a yellow card for Almoez Ali a few minutes ago as well.     4.30pm    28 min Ecuador are in complete control. I would tell you how much possession they\u2019ve had, but Fifa have introduced an odd three-way possession measurement: Qatar, In Contest and Ecuador. I told you this tournament was a platform for progress.     4.27pm    26 min \u201cHi Rob,\u201d says Simon McMahon. \u201cI think the West should concentrate on 150 years of its own dodgy offside decisions before criticising the Qataris. #iamnicolaberti\"      4.27pm    25 min Qatar have their first extended spell of possession until the diligent Plata boots the ball away.     4.25pm    23 min No host team has ever lost the opening game of the tournament. Football is a funny old game, but at the moment, Qatar look out of their depth.   Updated at 4.35pm GMT    4.24pm    22 min Okay, I think this clears up the offside decision. I thought Estrada headed it to himself, but if it was Torres who got the touch then Estrada was offside.      4.22pm    20 min Estrada heads over from Estupinan\u2019s cross, though it wouldn\u2019t have counted because Estupinan was just offside when he ran onto Hincapie\u2019s clever pass. Qatar are being completely outplayed at the moment.   Updated at 4.32pm GMT    4.21pm    18 min That offside decision is starting to look dodgier, by the way. If Estrada was penalised \u2013 and that\u2019s what the official graphic suggested \u2013 I think it\u2019s a mistake because he headed the ball to himself.      4.18pm    It was a lovely penalty. He waited for Alsheeb to dive and then stroked the ball arrogantly into the bottom-right corner.   Updated at 4.27pm GMT    4.18pm   GOAL! Qatar 0-1 Ecuador (Valencia 16 pen)  For the second time in the game, Enner Valencia puts Ecuador 1-0 up.   Updated at 7.14pm GMT    4.17pm   PENALTY TO ECUADOR!  15 min Poor Saad Alsheeb is having a nightmare. He\u2019s slow off his line and brings down Enner Valencia, a clear penalty. He might a bit lucky to only receive a yellow card, as I\u2019m not certain he was going for the ball.   Updated at 7.14pm GMT    4.16pm    14 min Okay, the official graphic now says Michael Estrada was offside, not the goalscorer Valencia. Now I really want to see that again.     4.14pm    13 min Ecuador continue to dominate, though they haven\u2019t had any clear chances since Valencia thought he had put them ahead. I\u2019d want to see his disallowed goal again to be sure but my instinct is that it\u2019s one of those joylessly correct decisions that are a speciality of VAR. And that it\u2019s about time we all recognised that this tournament is a platform for progress.  Updated at 4.15pm GMT    4.13pm    11 min \u201cThey\u2019ve got you too Rob???\u201d says Mike Nicholson. Look, I just think this is a platform for progress.     4.11pm    9 min Ecuador are starting to dominate possession. We\u2019re yet to see much of Qatar\u2019s front two, Akram Afif and Almoez Ali.     4.10pm    8 min There\u2019s plenty of talk of the game being fixed, but I do think that Valencia was legitimately \u2013 if marginally \u2013 offside.     4.09pm    6 min As someone at Guardian Towers has just said, the goalkeeper\u2019s incompetence saved Qatar. When he missed the original free-kick, it hit the head of an Ecuador player (I think), at which point there was only one defender (and no goalkeeper) between Valencia and the goal. It was very tight, but I think that\u2019s what happened. Either that or my \u00a35 bet on Qatar to win the tournament at 1,000-1 is looking very good.   Updated at 4.20pm GMT    4.08pm   NO GOAL! Qatar 0-0 Ecuador  I assume that, because the keeper was so far off his line, Valencia was offside when the original free-kick was headed up in the air.   Updated at 4.12pm GMT    4.07pm    There\u2019s a VAR check, I think for offside.  Updated at 7.13pm GMT    4.06pm    That was a bad mistake by the goalkeeper Saad Alsheeb. He came a long way off his line in an attempt to punch the free-kick clear, didn\u2019t get there and was out of the game as a result. Felix Torres hooked the ball back across the area, and Enner Valencia powered a header into the net from four yards.  Updated at 4.55pm GMT    4.05pm   GOAL! Qatar 0-1 Ecuador (Valencia 3)  A nightmare start for Qatar!   Updated at 4.10pm GMT    4.05pm    3 min Caicedo is wiped out just inside the Qatar half, which gives Ecuador a free-kick. From which\u2026     4.04pm    2 min \u201cThose are two utterly superb football strips for an opening game,\u201d says Paul Jaines. \u201cSurely no better for an opening game?\u201d They are very nice, but one game \u2013 and one image \u2013 springs to mind.      4.02pm    1 min Peep peep! Qatar kick off before the stadium announcer has finished his countdown. That was a bit odd.     4.01pm    The captain Hassan Alhaydos and Enner Valencia greet each other warmly and exchange pennants. Qatar \u201922, the 22nd World Cup, is finally about to begin.     3.59pm    The Qatar players lock arms for their anthem, which is sung quietly on the field and with increasing fervour off it.     3.57pm    The Ecuador players are belting out their anthem, with the goalkeeper Hernan Galindez in the Zamorano role.     3.54pm    The teams of Qatar and Ecuador stroll out of the tunnel, into the biggest game of their lives. Here we go!     3.54pm    Here\u2019s what the big guy had to say  Dear friends, welcome to the Fifa World Cup, Qatar 2022. Welcome to celebrate football, because football unites the world. And now, let\u2019s welcome the teams and let the show begin. All the best to everyone.      3.52pm    Oh lord, somebody\u2019s given Infantino the mic again.   Updated at 3.59pm GMT    3.48pm    Wales department \u201cI have literally just heard Wayne Hennessey say that Gareth Bale \u2018is full of spirits\u2019,\u201d says Ian Copestake. \u201cThis is surely wrong on at least two levels, no?\u201d He\u2019s just peddling his own misspelt cognac.     3.33pm    It\u2019s less than half an hour until this thing finally kicks off. I\u2019m off to grab a coffee, and then I\u2019ll see you for Qatar v Ecuador.      3.29pm    \u201cWatching both BBC and Fox streams from home in NY,\u201d says Mike Messenie. \u201cCount yourselves amongst the lucky in the UK. Fox coverage is shocking, there hasn\u2019t been a word about human rights, et al. Surprised to not see Murdoch sat by Infantino and MBS.\u201d   Updated at 3.31pm GMT    3.21pm    \u201cLoved the Mexico \u201886 highlight reel,\u201d says Guy Tayler. \u201cAlways loved that the goal nets were pulled back really far, making the goal have four top corners, which made all the long range screamers look even better. And that Denmark team\u2026\u201d Someone should write a book about them.   Updated at 3.36pm GMT    3.20pm    \u201cI\u2019m glad they showed the Emir playing football and the crowd cheering,\u201d writes Mark Mason. I was getting worried this might seem like some massive cult.\u201d      3.19pm         3.15pm   Qatar v Ecuador team news  Qatar (5-3-2) Saad Alsheeb; Pedro Miguel, Boualem Khoukhi, Bassam Hisham, Abdelkarim Hassan, Homam Ahmed; Abdulaziz Hatem, Hassan Alhaydos, Karim Boudiaf; Akram Afif, Almoez Ali.Substitutes: Mohammed Waad, Tarek Salman, Ahmed Alaaeldin, Yousof Hassan, Meshaal Barsham, Ali Assaballa, Mohammed Muntari, Musaab Khidir, Ismail Mohamad, Khalid Muneer, Salem Al Hajri, Assim Madibo, Naif Abdulraheem, Jassem Gaber, Mostafa Tarek Meshaal.

Updated at 3.19pm GMT    3.06pm    \u201cFootball spans the world, unites nations in their love of the beautiful game,\u201d says Morgan Freeman. \u201cWhat brings together nations, brings together communities.\u201d It\u2019s remarkably insulting piffle, let\u2019s be honest.     3.05pm    Now it\u2019s time for La\u2019eeb, the tournament mascot, who is floating round the stadium while another dance routine is performed. Then he makes way for BTS\u2019s Jung Kook, who belts out his new song Dreamers. Good lad.    Updated at 3.08pm GMT    2.58pm    After a display of the 32 flags, and what looked like walking replica shirts, it\u2019s time for another dance routine, this time by people dressed all in red and wearing what look like VR goggles. We\u2019re in an alternate reality all right.   Updated at 3.07pm GMT    2.55pm    Visually, the ceremony is remarkably impressive \u2013 I honestly can\u2019t do it justice, and it\u2019s got nothing to do with a fear of saying the wrong thing and being cancelled before Qatar v Ecuador has even kicked off \u2013 although I\u2019m not sure about the hypnotic chants of \u2018Please Don\u2019t Take Me Home\u2019 and \u2018Ole Ole Ole\u2019.      2.52pm    \u201cThere is a common thread of hope, jubilation and respect,\u201d says Morgan Freeman, whose surname suddenly feels like an act of trolling.   Updated at 2.59pm GMT    2.48pm    Morgan Freeman is on the stage, talking about unity, while \u2026 I don\u2019t know how to begin describing this. Just watch it. Chris Morris has excelled himself.    Updated at 2.51pm GMT    2.46pm   Qatar 2022 is under way!  The lights have been dimmed at the Al Bayt Stadium, and the opening ceremony is about to begin.     2.39pm    England latest      2.39pm    Well, this is awkward. The UK TV coverage doesn\u2019t begin for another 22 minutes, so I don\u2019t know whether the opening ceremony is happening as I type. Tremendous. If I\u2019ve missed Robbie Williams I\u2019ll be filthy.   Updated at 2.43pm GMT    2.37pm    Netherlands latest      2.36pm         2.32pm    It\u2019s nearly time for the opening ceremony. You\u2019d better have brought those moves.      2.27pm    \u201cI was five when Mexico 86 was in full flow,\u201d writes Matt Gaw. \u201cI remember Maradona\u2019s second goal as something truly special... but maybe not quite as special as hearing my dad say the C-word for the first time in response to Diego\u2019s flappy hand. Happy days.\u201d     2.26pm    It\u2019s an open goal, sure, but Jamie Carragher has finished with aplomb   Updated at 2.27pm GMT    2.22pm         2.21pm    Spain latest Here\u2019s another good story from Reuters. It might also be a good question for the Knowledge.  Spain winger Ferran Torres faces big challenges at the World Cup in Qatar but his relationship with the daughter of national team coach Luis Enrique is not one of them, according to the Barcelona player. \u201cNot at all,\u201d Torres told a news conference on Sunday when asked whether he felt pressure because of the relationship. \u201cI think the coach and I, we know how to differentiate between when it\u2019s family and when we are manager and player. I think we have to get on with it in a natural way, just that and we\u2019re getting along fine.\u201d Torres, 22, went public about his relationship with Sira Martinez, a Spanish show-jumper who is also 22, this year. Luis Enrique joked about it on Saturday when he was asked which of the Spain players represented an extension of him on the field of play. \u201cVery easy - it\u2019s Mr Ferran Torres - otherwise my daughter will come after me and chop off my head,\u201d the coach said in an online chat. The former Manchester City winger is one of several young players trusted by Luis Enrique as he seeks to build a new Spanish powerhouse to rival the team who won the World Cup in South Africa in 2010. \u201cWe are a team with a lot ahead of us, we are very young,\u201d Torres said. \u201cThe young ones, we are very hungry, very ambitious and keen to show off our football.\u201d   Updated at 2.23pm GMT    2.16pm    \u201cConflicted as I am about watching the damn thing, I resort to The Guardian\u2019s liveblog to follow the shenanigans as per usual,\u201d says Giancarlo Sandoval. \u201cAll I can say is holding both the sham that is this World Cup and the actual football together will prove difficult, but I am glad to have a conflicted liveblog rather than one that pretends that this whole thing is not riddled with horrifying issues. Vamos!\u201d I sometimes wonder if that makes us worse. I\u2019m conflicted about being conflicted!     2.15pm    \u201cIf you spell Qatar\u2019s star player\u2019s surname backwards, you get \u2018Fifa\u2019,\u201d writes Admir Pajic, \u201cwhich is ironic because when Fifa goes backwards, you get a November/December World Cup in Qatar.\u201d   Updated at 2.22pm GMT    2.03pm    Now that\u2019s a view  Meanwhile, here\u2019s my view.   Updated at 2.05pm GMT    2.02pm    Nostalgia corner I\u2019m not sure any World Cup has produced as many great goals \u2013 or iconic commentaries \u2013 as Mexico 86. This is a thing of soul-stirring beauty.      1.58pm    \u201cHi Rob,\u201d writes Beth. \u201cEveryone is rightly highlighting migrant worker deaths, human rights abuses, LGBTQ stance, etc. yet hardly anyone is mentioning what a crap deal women get in Qatar. They do not live as equals. \u201cI am a member of the LGBTQ clan so obviously hold those issues very close to my heart, but as a woman I\u2019d have a significantly more limited and less free existence if i was born in Qatar. I do not understand why more people are not speaking about this. Can you shed any light?\u201d I wish I could. Though it\u2019s impossible to quantify, it does feel like the issue of women\u2019s rights has been relatively underreported (even though there have been some good pieces). I don\u2019t know the answer, but I suspect it\u2019s not a pleasant one.     1.55pm    A World Cup isn\u2019t a World Cup without an email from Gary Naylor \u201cPrompted by Ian Copestake\u2019s first email of the tournament, I was about to draft the last email of the tournament, looking back on outrageously unlikely events, deadpanning all the way. But I can\u2019t quite find the seam of levity to mine (it\u2019s not just that the humour shrivels on the screen, it just won\u2019t come).  \u201cMaybe it takes a genius like David Squires, but even he has gone for education over entertainment so far. Football eh? Bloody Hell! Alas, for too many, a description not an exclamation.\u201d     1.54pm    This is a cracking read      1.51pm    France decide not to replace Benzema And here\u2019s a third.  France coach Didier Deschamps has decided not to replace injured striker Karim Benzema in his World Cup squad, leaving the reigning champions with 25 players for their title defence. Benzema trained with the squad for the first time since arriving in Qatar on Saturday but was forced to leave the session early with a thigh injury and scans ruled him out of the tournament. Asked on Sunday by TeleFoot whether he would replace the Ballon d\u2019Or winner in his squad, Deschamps said \u201cNo\u201d. \u201cThis is a quality group,\u201d he added. \u201cIn everything they do, both on and off the pitch, they are united. I have confidence in them.\u201d France open their campaign against Australia on Tuesday and also play Tunisia and Denmark in Group D.    Updated at 1.56pm GMT    1.49pm    Depay to miss Senegal game Here\u2019s another Reuters report on an injured attacker.  Memphis Depay will miss out on the Netherlands\u2019 opening World Cup game against Senegal, coach Louis van Gaal said on Sunday. The forward hurt his hamstring playing for the Dutch against Poland in the Nations League in September but this week told reporters he was fit to play after participating in training. \u201cIt will be a blow for us just like Sadio Mane missing for Senegal is a blow for them,\u201d Van Gaal said of Monday\u2019s Group A clash against the African champions in Doha. Van Gaal has insisted that players selected for matches be 100 per cent match fit and in form.       1.49pm    Brass tacks department      1.49pm    Lukaku likely to miss Belgium\u2019s first two games Here\u2019s a Reuters story on the news that divisive goal machine Romelu Lukaku probably won\u2019t be fit until Belgium\u2019s final group game. Buy shares in Michy Batshuayi while you can .  Belgium\u2019s record goalscorer Romelu Lukaku trained apart from the squad on Sunday as uncertainty over his fitness continued to cast a shadow over the team\u2019s World Cup campaign. Lukaku, 29, has made two substitute appearances in the last four months at club level as he struggles with a hamstring injury and is unlikely to be ready for Belgium\u2019s opening Group F clashes against Canada on Wednesday and Morocco, officials told a news conference on Sunday. His situation is being evaluated on a daily basis, and the objective is to have him available for the last group game against Croatia on December 1. Lukaku is a key part of a Belgian side hoping to live up to their lofty Fifa ranking of second in the world. He has scored a record 68 goals in 102 internationals. Wing back Thomas Meunier also trained individually as he continues his recovery from a cheekbone fracture. He played 20 minutes in Friday\u2019s friendly loss to Egypt in Kuwait City. Leandro Trossard returned to training after a light injury, as did back-up goalkeeper Koen Casteels and attacker Thorgan Hazard.      1.42pm    Say cheese Steven Bloor has selected some of the most eye-catching player portraits, including a smouldering Jack Grealish and a man with a nickname you\u2019ll never be able to forget.   Updated at 1.45pm GMT    1.36pm    World Cup briefing: day one Throughout the tournament, we\u2019ll have a World Cup briefing every morning. The first has been lovingly penned by Gregg Bakowski.      1.31pm    Some news from the USA camp  The US play Wales tomorrow in a mouthwatering match that might ultimately decide whether they reach the last 16. Or it might not.  Updated at 1.40pm GMT    1.23pm    The first email of the tournament comes from Ian Copestake  \"I started a very long email (Infantino length!) as this event brings up so many thoughts, memories, issues. But \u2018at the end of the day\u2019 I just want to say I am here for you, bro\u2019! So glad to have you on board even if it is the Titanic!.      1.15pm    Who will win the World Cup (apart from Joe Lycett)? Brazil and Argentina are the popular choices, though it\u2019s not entirely beyond the realms that Brazil \u2013 like the 2018 favourites, Germany \u2013 could go out in the first round. I think Spain are the best European team in the tournament, but they have a stinker of a group and could also end up on flight DO1 from Doha before the knockout stage begins. In short, it\u2019s a William Goldman World Cup: nobody knows anything. Just the way it should be.  (Since you asked, I have Mexico in the sweepstake, which at least adds a bit of certainty to my life.)  Updated at 1.18pm GMT    1.13pm    Today\u2019s match will be played at the spectacular Al Bayt Stadium. You can read all about it \u2013 the good, the bad and unforgivable \u2013 here.      1.11pm    Team guides We have an interactive guide to every team, and indeed every player. Let\u2019s start with the hosts, a side who\u2026 well, nobody really knows.  Ecuador have gone under the radar \u2013 they live under the radar \u2013 but could ruin a few wallcharts that have been prematurely filled in. To borrow from Barry Davies, when will we learn that major tournaments never pan out as expected. (In 2018, for example, Germany were supposed to play England in the quarter-finals. Didn\u2019t happen.) Anyway, Ecuador. Read all about them.      1.07pm    Get your questions in for Football Daily      1.05pm    Best laid plans department   Updated at 1.07pm GMT    1.00pm   Preamble  Hello and welcome to the greatest sham on earth. Qatar 2022: the tournament that puts the \u2018vile\u2019 in \u2018violation\u2019. It\u2019s a despicable farce \u2013 part sinister power trip, part Chris Morris satire \u2013 and comes with a human cost that is acceptable only to those with a disease of the mind. But it\u2019s also a World Cup, the greatest show on earth, so there\u2019s a fair bit of the old cognitive dissonance flying round. Rampant human-rights violations, World Cup. World Cup, rampant human-rights violations. I\u2019m well aware that, even in the Guardian echo chamber, there won\u2019t be a consensus about the most appropriate way to liveblog this tournament. I\u2019m sure some of you are thinking, \u2018For heaven\u2019s sake man, concentrate on the football, I want to know whether Qatar invert their wing-backs!\u2019 Others will feel we shouldn\u2019t be talking about the football at all, that this minute-by-minute report shouldn\u2019t exist, that the Guardian should take a stand by liveblogging Alan Titchmarsh\u2019s Love Your Garden on ITV instead. The football will take over soon enough \u2013 it always does \u2013 but the controversy isn\u2019t going to disappear, especially after the Fifa president Gianni Infantino gave the most bizarre speech since Father Ted Crilly received his Golden Cleric award and launched into an extended score-settler. And there are still some disturbing unknowns, not least how fans will be treated if they don\u2019t show a little bit of flex and compromise. I\u2019ll be honest, I don\u2019t know how to segue delicately to the actual football, so I\u2019m just going to do it and hope I get away with it. In a few hours\u2019 time, the hosts Qatar will kick off against Ecuador in Al Khor. Group A also contains Senegal and the Netherlands, who meet in the tournament\u2019s first big game tomorrow, so both teams could really do with a win today. The focus on Qatar the nation means we know very little about Qatar the team. They were impressive winners of the Asian Cup in 2019, winning all seven games and conceding only one goal. Their recent form isn\u2019t as strong, but they did draw with Chile and have two very exciting attacking talents in Akram Afif and Almoez Ali.  Qatar have been training together for five months, which puts them five up on the other 31 teams. But they are still, in more ways than one, the outsiders in Group A. Whatever we might think of Qatar hosting the tournament, we shouldn\u2019t ignore the rich, complicated human story of a squad representing their country in such a seismic event. Ecuador\u2019s young side qualified impressively, finishing ahead of teams like Chile, Colombia and Peru, although their recent results have had \u2013 and what a fragrance this would be - a whiff of George Graham: 1-0, 0-0, 1-0, 0-0, 0-0, 0-0. Brighton\u2019s Moises Caicedo is the star of a dynamic team who are some people\u2019s dark horses to go deepish in the tournament. The opening ceremony begins shortly; then it\u2019ll be time \u2013 finally - to watch some football. Let\u2019s get this sham/show on the road. Kick off 4pm in London, 7pm in Al Khor, 11am in Quito.  Updated at 1.39pm GMT "

                    "body": "Aaron Mooy gently agonises over every one of his answers for 10 full minutes before eventually confirming what was already long suspected. \u201cI\u2019m not much of a big talker around the room,\u201d he says quietly, inviting supportive laughter. \u201cEveryone that knows me knows that.\u201d\nThe midfielder, seated at a press conference table in front of a dozen journalists, had just been reminded of his relative seniority compared to many of his World Cup teammates and asked if he was providing a strong guiding presence in the dressing room.\n\n\u201cI just try and do the right things off the pitch, on the pitch, and yeah, hopefully, I dunno, I don\u2019t like to talk about myself.\u201d Mooy is laughing now, too, and the Socceroos media manager is murmuring something to him about letting his football do the talking. \u201cYeah,\u201d he says. \u201cHopefully just try and play well, and then hopefully that inspires people.\u201d\nFor as long as Mooy has been playing for Australia \u2013 he has 53 caps, for the record, equal with Aziz Behich and behind only Mat Ryan (75) and Mat Leckie (73) \u2013 he has been frugal with the spoken word. One can only speculate, but it seems he is simply shy. In a world loaded with loud voices, it is endearing, and inversely makes you want to hear more of what he has to say.\nOn this particular occasion it feels as if the 32-year-old should have quite a lot of material. There was that shock move in 2020 from Brighton to Shanghai SIPG, followed by his mid-pandemic departure and five clubless months. Then came those lonely training sessions at a local park in Glasgow with only Socceroos coaching staff for company, trying to ready himself to play some part in Australia\u2019s qualifying playoffs against the United Arab Emirates and Peru.\n\n\u201cIt was a tough period for me,\u201d he says. \u201cIn China there was lots of Covid restrictions and stuff like that. Arnie [coach Graham Arnold] gave me a call a few times and he wanted me to be involved, so that gave me a real motivation. They wanted me to be there and yeah, that\u2019s what my focus was on. Just worked as hard as I could, got into the best shape as possible and tried to help.\n\u201cProbably [also] the little boy inside of me that started playing football, that\u2019s probably what motivated me. Always the World Cup, we were close to qualifying and \u2026 I knew that if I was going to be involved I didn\u2019t want to let anyone down.\u201d\n\nMooy went into those June matches otherwise cold yet somehow played the full 90 and 120 minutes, exceeding internal expectations about how far his body would take him.\nAfter that, of course, Ange Postecoglou had seen enough to afford him another chance in the UK at Celtic where, after a tentative start, he has forced his way into the team and made 20 appearances including eight starts \u2013 one against Real Madrid at the Bernab\u00e9u in the Champions League. At the time, the former Socceroos boss said Mooy\u2019s \u201cunique situation\u201d presented a reciprocal opportunity for both club and player.\n\u201cObviously he was with Shanghai and that sort of didn\u2019t work out in the end,\u201d Postecoglou told Fox Sports last month. \u201cAnd him being based here in Glasgow, I just thought it was a good opportunity for both sides, for him and for us to do something quickly to bring him in.\n\u201cHe\u2019s a good footballer, he\u2019s somebody I knew well and I knew he could contribute here \u2026 he\u2019s finding his feet now after getting his fitness up to speed, because he\u2019d obviously missed pre-season and hadn\u2019t played a lot of football, but I think everyone can see now he\u2019s sort of getting to a really good condition. And his football\u2019s been really good over recent games.\u201d\nMooy himself describes Scotland as \u201ca very testing place\u201d to play. \u201cEvery day we go in with the boys and train a hundred miles an hour,\u201d he adds. \u201cThat\u2019s the way Ange likes it and there\u2019s no days where it\u2019s just chill, so it\u2019s intense and it\u2019s a good place to be.\u201d\n\nHarry Kewell, the Socceroos great and Celtic first-team coach who is in Australia for the club\u2019s two-match tour against Sydney FC and Everton, felt Mooy handled the pressure with aplomb.\n\u201cFor Aaron to step up and play and to force his way into the team, it takes a lot because we don\u2019t let anything slide,\u201d Kewell told AAP. \u201cYou have to be at your very best at training to even be in the manager\u2019s mind.\u201d\nMooy does not, of course, need to point out that this isn\u2019t where the story ends, because here he is, in Qatar, five days before Australia\u2019s opening World Cup game against France.\nMooy\u2019s talking on the pitch that he struggles to speak of is looking very much like one of Australia\u2019s key strengths at this juncture, with teammate Martin Boyle (knee) racing the clock to be fit for the opening Group D fixture on Tuesday night (Wednesday 6am AEDT)."

Jewellery and watches were among the items stolen at the home of the Chelsea winger, who is understood to have been left \u201cshaken\u201d by the break-in and left fearing for the safety of his fiancee and children.\nIt remains to be seen whether Sterling is comfortable with returning to England\u2019s World Cup camp. The 27-year-old has been a key player for Gareth Southgate, whose side face France on Saturday night, and has scored 20 goals in 81 caps.\nAs it stands Southgate must prepare for the task of facing the world champions on the basis that Sterling is not available. However England are not short of options in attack.

Brazil is the most powerful and the best national team at the World Cup.\nWhat I\u2019ve seen so far, when you take a look at their selection of players, their quality, skills and value, then it is indeed terrifying.\nI think we have a great exam ahead of us, a tough task against the team which plays great soccer with so many good, quality and fast players.\nBrazil have self-confidence, a splendid atmosphere in the team, which is visible, as well as top players \u2026 However, we will not give in. I think we have nothing to fear\nWe need to enter the match with much faith, self-confidence and looking for our chances, enjoy the occasion of playing Brazil, that\u2019s it. If only it were the final.\nIt is a great team, but I believe that we can challenge them, we need to be smart \u2026 The match is not 50-50, but we are also not outsiders.\n\n\n\n\n\n 1.54pm  \n\nSpain\u2019s players have been looking rather swish in their pre-match walkabout of the pitch at the Education City Stadium in Al Rayya.\n\n\nThere\u2019s a strong fashion element among the fans as well.\n\n\n\n\n\n 1.47pm  \nTeam news: Morocco v Spain\n\nMorocco have never made it beyond the second round before, but come into this game unbeaten and only having conceded one goal. Selim Amallah is in for Abdelhamid Sabiri in the only change to the team that beat Canada 2-1 last time out.\nMorocco: Yassine Bounou, Achraf Hakimi, Noussair Mazraoui, Nayef Aguerd, Romain Saiss (c), Sofyan Amrabat, Selim Amallah, Azzedine Ounahi, Hakim Ziyech, Soufiane Boufal, Youssef En-Nesyri\nSpain are having an odd World Cup, having absolutely thumped Costa Rica to set down a marker, then ended up only narrowly squeaking through their group thanks to that shock defeat against Japan. They are seeking their first quarter-final berth since they won the thing in 2010. Llorente and Laporte are back in the side, but Morata drops to the bench, which won\u2019t do much for his golden boot aspirations. Pedri, Marco Asensio and Ferran Torres are also all back in the starting XI.\nSpain: Unai Simon, Marcos Llorente, Aymeric Laporte, Rodri, Jordi Alba, Sergio Busquets (c), Gavi, Pedri, Ferran Torres, Dani Olmo, Marco Asensio\nThe officials today are referee Fernando Andr\u00e9s Rapallini (Argentina) being assisted by compatriots Juan Pablo Belatti and Diego Yamil Bonf\u00e1. The fourth official with that humdinger of a sponsored sign to hold up will be Raphael Claus of Brazil.\nAt the controls for the MBM action for us is John Brewin \u2026\n\nI\u2019ll be keeping this blog running until kick-off to mop up any other World Cup news as it emerges.\n\n\n\n 1.33pm  \n\nMorocco have arrived at the stadium for their first knockout match in a World Cup since 1986.\n\n\n\n\n\n 1.23pm  \n\nRight, Martin Belam back here now. I can confirm this was pretty much what the dog\u2019s face looked like when I dragged her out of her bed out into the cold for forty minutes so I could get a nice cup of gentrified Walthamstow coffee.\n\nWe are probably about half an hour away from some team news ahead of the Morocco v Spain clash, which kicks off at 3pm GMT at the Education City Stadium in Al Rayyan. We are already getting some images through of fans gathering at the Souq Waqif in Doha.\n\n\nIncidentally the Fifa World Cup website is giving these as \u201cpossible starting XIs\u201d, so make of that what you will:\nMorocco: Yassine Bounou, Achraf Hakimi, Nayef Aguerd, Romain Saiss, Noussair Mazraoui, Abdelhamid Sabiri, Sofyan Amrabat, Azzedine Ounahi, Hakim Ziyech, Youssef En-Nesyri, Sofiane Boufal\nSpain: Unai Simon, Jordi Alba, Aymeric Laporte, Rodri, Cesar Azpilicueta or Dani Carvajal, Pedri, Sergio Busquets, Gavi, Ferran Torres, Marco Asensio, Dani Olmo\n\n\n\n 1.09pm  \n\nWhat a rollercoaster year Richarlison is having: from almost being relegated with Everton (it was he more than anyone else who helped keep them up, mind), to moving to Spurs and looking like he was going to miss the World Cup through injury, to starring on the biggest stage. If he carries on scoring at this rate, he could be Mbapp\u00e9\u2019s biggest rival for that shiny collection of golden World Cup gongs. \n\n\n\n\n 12.53pm  \n\nSticking with the young French superstar, Eric Devin has penned this piece asking whether Mbapp\u00e9 could make a bit of history by scooping all the shiny trophies on offer in Qatar. \n\nNot since Paolo Rossi at the 1982 World Cup has a player won the Golden Ball, Golden Boot and World Cup. Before that only Garrincha in 1962 and Mario Kempes had completed the trio. Now, though, Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 is on course to upend the poor correlation between individual awards and team success. There has been little doubting his talent, especially after he played such an instrumental role in helping France secure the title in 2018, but this season has been tougher for Mbapp\u00e9, with the sizzling form of Messi and Neymar leaving him a little in the shade.\n\n\n\n\n\n 12.46pm  \n\nHello, Gregg here. I\u2019ll be keeping the blog ticking over while Martin walks his dog. Let\u2019s start by having a look at the race for the Golden Boot. If France beat England, it really does look like Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 will have himself a fancy new golden slipper doesn\u2019t it? He might even have done enough already \u2013 five goals has been enough to win it at two of the past five World Cups.\nSouth Korea/Japan 2002 Ronaldo (Brazil) 8Germany 2006 Miroslav Klose (Germany) 5South Africa 2010 Thomas Muller (Germany) 5Brazil 2014 James Rodr\u00edguez (Colombia) 6Russia 2018 Harry Kane (England) 6\nMind you, he still needs another eight goals just to equal the all-time Golden Boot record set by his compatriot Just Fontaine back in 1958, who ended on a ridiculous total of 13. Four goals in the third-place playoff skews that total somewhat though.\n\n\n\nUpdated at 12.47pm GMT\n\n\n 12.30pm  \n\nJohn Brewin has put together today\u2019s Football Daily, and has this to say on the topic of Brazil\u2019s dancing:\nAt previous World Cups, the thought of the Sele\u00e7\u00e3o playing their jogo bonito samba-style and other overused cliches in front of empty seats would be unthinkable, but plastic blue lids were freely visible for the 974 BoxPark recyclable stadium\u2019s final stand. But thank Gianni Infantino for the sight of the Sele\u00e7\u00e3o playing their jogo bonito samba-style and other overused cliches, to make the Human Rights World Cup feel like an actual real Copa do Mundo. From Le\u00f4nidas da Silva to Didi, to Clodoaldo to Denilson and his mates juggling to Sergio Mendes in an airport for a footwear manufacturer, Brazil have always brought the moves. \u201cWe have 10 different dances,\u201d roared Richarlison at full-time. His goal, Brazil\u2019s third, included their coach, T1te, adopting the John Sergeant/Gregg Wallace dad-dancing role.\nCue furrowed brows from Proper Football Men in the gantry, Roy Keane and Graeme Souness not missing their cue on ITV. In Ireland, another Didi, Hamann, joined in on RT\u00c9. \u201cThe dancing in the first half, and then taking the keeper off,\u201d he wailed, after T1te had extended the party to include third-choice goalie Weverton. The Wev\u2019s second-half arrival meant every member of the 26-man squad has played at this HWRC. But will Brazil still be dancing against Argentina, and before that, Croatia in the quarters? The PFM hope not, after such disrespect to the game. But Gianni\u2019s fun franchise really needs them to keep doing so.\nGet the rest of Football Daily here: Brazil bring their dancing shoes to furrow the brows of Proper Football Men\n\n\n\n\n 12.20pm  \n\nIt wasn\u2019t just Brazil\u2019s players who were celebrating their win yesterday \u2013 and let\u2019s be honest it looked like Brazil could have pushed on and scored more if they\u2019d really wanted to \u2013 but their fans were going wild as well. Here are some of the scenes \u2026\n\n\n\n\n 12.05pm  \n\nMuch debate to be had about Brazil\u2019s dancing celebrations yesterday. TV pundit Roy Keane, from the famously dance-shy Ireland, was among those very vocally thinking it was all a bit much, and disrespectful to a South Korea team who were giving their best in a World Cup knock-out match. \nKorea\u2019s goal scorer Paik Seung-ho was pretty relaxed about it though, and has said:\n\nI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a lack of respect. They enjoy that and I respect it. I like it too. They can celebrate how they like. They are great players and that\u2019s the way Brazilian football is: they enjoy it. You have to understand that and enjoy it too. We don\u2019t have choreographed celebrations quite like them but we do have some. \n\n\n\n\n\n 12.00pm  \n\nI was just reading my colleague Alex Hern\u2019s TechScape newsletter about \u201cChatGPT, the viral AI tool that may be a vision of our weird tech future\u201d, and so I thought I\u2019d try it and see if it is near to putting me out of a job yet.\nI asked if it could \u201cwrite a paragraph for a Guardian live blog previewing Morocco v Spain at the 2022 Fifa World Cup in Qatar?\u201d\nThe computer said it couldn\u2019t really, as \u201cI don\u2019t have information about current events or the ability to predict the outcome of events, such as the results of a soccer match\u201d, but then went on to say \u201cI can provide general information about Morocco and Spain that could be used in a preview of a soccer match between the two teams\u201d.\nSo here goes \u2026\n\nMorocco is a country in north Africa known for its rich culture and history. The Moroccan national soccer team, known as the Atlas Lions, has qualified for the World Cup on five occasions. Spain, on the other hand, is a European powerhouse in the world of soccer. The Spanish national team, known as La Roja, is a two-time European champion and has one of the best records in international soccer. In a match between Morocco and Spain at the 2022 World Cup in Qatar, fans can expect to see two teams with very different styles of play facing off on the field.\n\nI mean, is it any less insightful than when I predicted England v Iran would be an unsatisfactory and tense win for the Three Lions in the opening match? Or yesterday, when I suggested Croatia and Japan might serve up \u201ca classic\u201d?\n\n\n\n 11.47am  \n\nJapan put in one of the worst World Cup penalty shootout performances since Switzerland managed to get knocked out in 2006 by Ukraine without even converting one after the undisputed dullest game in World Cup history. There are some great pictures on the news wires just dropping of Japan on media duties in the wake of it today, with the team not looking anywhere near as dejected as they did last night.\n\n\nWell, OK, there is some dejection on display there as well.\n\nThe English-language publication The Asahi Shimbun is carrying some quotes from the team, in particular from Yuto Nagatomo, the 36-year-old veteran defender who was playing in his fourth World Cup. He told the media:\n\nI want people to give praise to the younger players who fought until the last minute, and to the players who kicked the penalties with courage. I don\u2019t think Japan was inferior to Croatia. Not at all. We fully displayed our strength.\n\nKaoru Mitoma, who missed Japan\u2019s second penalty, seems to be heaping some of the blame on himself. He said \u201cI am responsible. I caused trouble. I was ready to carry the torch from people like Nagatomo, and I put myself up for the penalty shootout. I thought I was resolutely prepared. But maybe it just wasn\u2019t enough.\u201d\nHe went on to say \u201cI must become a player who can make the team win. A great player is the one who can perform big at the World Cup and lead the team to the final eight. I will come back in four years and go for it again.\u201d\n\n\n\n 11.26am  \n\nPortugal\u2019s social media manager is posting relaxed pictures of the squad all smiling in togetherness. Not in the picture: C Ronaldo.\n\n\n\n\n 11.10am  \n\nReuters is carrying a report saying that Moroccans have been flying into Qatar for their team\u2019s knockout World Cup match against Spain on Tuesday even as fans already in the country have been scrambling for tickets, adding to demand for seats in a potential challenge for the organisers.\nThe last Arab and African side left in World Cup, Morocco has been willed on by some of the most impassioned fans at the tournament, many of whom live and work in Qatar and are hoping to see their team advance to its first quarter-final.\n\nDesperate to attend the match against 2010 champions Spain, more than 1,000 Moroccan fans gathered at the official ticketing office on Monday night. Reuters journalists saw at least two scuffles and riot police deploy as the crowd swelled. One fan said many had left empty-handed.\nSome said they had come after seeing social media posts saying the Moroccan embassy and football association would distribute free tickets. Reuters could not reach the Moroccan football federation for comment.\nThe Moroccan embassy said on Twitter that it had handed out 500 tickets to Moroccans living in Qatar. The Moroccan football team\u2019s official Facebook page had said Fifa had made 5,000 extra tickets available for Morocco fans.\nSome have struck lucky, saying they had got tickets from the Moroccan football federation. One of them was Mohammed-Tayyeb Muhyi, who said he got his ticket after landing in Qatar on Tuesday. He said he had neither a flight nor a match ticket 24 hours earlier.Another Morocco fan, Houda Belkadi El Haloui, who has been in Qatar for three weeks, said she also got a ticket from the football federation after it called her and told her to collect it from a coffee shop.\n\u201cI had a chance to get one, but I am very afraid for my other brothers and sisters that they will be blocked outside the stadium. I\u2019m very afraid. I hope the Moroccan supporters will understand that there is a problem \u2026 I ask them to stay calm.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n 10.42am  \n\nFormer England striker Ian Wright has delivered a slapdown this morning for people on social media who have been picking up on former England striker Eni Aluko dropping a maths clanger live on air during the Brazil match last night on ITV in the UK.\n\n\n\n\n 10.34am  \n\nCameroon soccer federation president and former star player Samuel Eto\u2019o was filmed apparently kicking a man to the ground in an altercation outside a World Cup stadium early Tuesday.\nAP report from Doha that Eto\u2019o had paused to pose for photos with fans near Stadium 974 after Brazil beat South Korea 4-1. Footage circulating on social media showed him then reacting to comments by a man holding a camera.\nThe former Barcelona and Inter Milan forward was initially held back by people in his entourage then got clear and appeared to aim a kick at the man, who fell backwards to the ground.\nEto\u2019o has been in Qatar as president of the soccer federation of Cameroon.\nAP say that Fifa did not immediately respond to a request for comment. A spokesperson for the Cameroon federation did not immediately answer phone calls or respond to messages seeking comment.\nQatar\u2019s Supreme Committee for Delivery and Legacy, which oversees the World Cup, and its government did not immediately respond to questions about the incident.\nSome sources on social media are suggesting that the man, who had been filming Eto\u2019o, was an Algerian YouTuber who was attempting to question him about the controversial World Cup qualifier between Algeria and Cameroon earlier this year. After a number of incidents during the second leg of the playoff, Algeria had unsuccessfully appealed for the match to be replayed.\n\n\n\n 10.27am  \n\nWhisper it, but there are only ten games left of this World Cup. And one of those is the third place play-off that belongs in the dustbin of history. Here are the remaining confirmed fixtures and permutations:\nTuesday 6 DecemberR16: Morocco v Spain (3pm GMT, Education City Stadium)R16: Portugal v Switzerland (7pm GMT, Lusail Iconic Stadium)\nFriday 9 DecemberQF1: Croatia v Brazil (3pm GMT, Education City Stadium)QF2: Netherlands v Argentina (7pm GMT, Lusail Iconic Stadium)\nSaturday 10 DecemberQF3: Morocco or Spain v Portugal or Switzerland (3pm GMT, Al Thumama Stadium)QF4: England v France (7pm GMT, Al Bayt Stadium)\nTuesday 13 DecemberSF: Netherlands or Argentina v Croatia v Brazil (7pm GMT, Lusail Iconic Stadium)\nWednesday 14 DecemberSF: England or France v winners QF3 (7pm GMT, Al Bayt Stadium)\nSaturday 17 DecemberThird place play-off: Losing semi-finalists (3pm GMT, Khalifa International Stadium)\nSunday 18 DecemberFinal: Winning semi-finalists (3pm GMT, Lusail Iconic Stadium)\n\n\n\n 9.46am  \n\nXherdan Shaqiri has been dobbing in his teammates ahead of the 7pm GMT kick-off against Portugal later today. Breel Embolo gets nominated as the funniest member of the squad, but also the one who is always late. Ricardo Rodriguez gets slated as worst singer, while coach Murat Yakin is awarded the rating of least funny. Shaqiri was certainly displaying more of a sense of humour in this video than was seen on the field against Serbia, that\u2019s for sure.\n\n\n\n\n 9.40am  \n\nYesterday it became clear that Saudi Arabia were all set to host the 2027 Asian Cup, after India pulled out of bidding for hosting duties. John Duerden from AP reports some additional details this morning.\nSaudi Arabia is set to be officially confirmed as 2027 host in February when the Asian Football Confederation meets in Bahrain. It will be the first time that the country has staged the continental competition.\n\u201cPeople forget that Saudi Arabia has hosted many international events including the 1989 World Youth Cup and three editions of the Confederations Cup,\u201d Hafez Al-Medlej, a former member of the Saudi Arabia Football Federation and the AFC, told domestic media.\n\u201cThe 2027 Asian Cup will be one of the most successful Asian competitions given Saudi Arabia\u2019s ability to host sporting events and this will show that the country will be able to host the World Cup in the coming years.\u201d\nIndia\u2019s football federation said the Asian Cup in 2027 didn\u2019t fit its strategic priorities. \u201cIndia has always been a wonderful and efficient host to big tournaments, which was amply demonstrated in the recently concluded FIFA Under-17 Women\u2019s World Cup,\u201d AIFF President Kalyan Chaubey said in a statetment.\n\u201cHowever, the Executive Committee has decided that the overall strategy of the federation currently remains on focusing on the fundamental goals to strengthen our football at every level from grassroots to youth development.\u201d\nWorld Cup host Qatar was awarded the 2023 edition of the Asian Cup after China handed back its hosting rights, citing the Covid-19 pandemic. That tournament is expected to be pushed back to January 2024.\nSaudi Arabia are thought to be involved in plans for a cross-federation bid for the 2030 World Cup, with either Morocco or Egypt as co-hosts, or a three-way bid that would involve Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Greece.\n\n\n\n 9.29am  \n\nIf you woke up this morning with a burning desire to see Jack Grealish and Declan Rice pinging the ball across a swimming pool to each other while just wearing shorts, then today is your lucky day.\n\n\n\n\n 9.26am  \n\nFifa has highlighted a couple of quotes on their website ahead of the 3pm GMT kick-off today between Morocco and Spain.\nIt features Luis Enrique, with defeat to Japan clearly on his mind, saying: \u201cIf against Morocco we have the fortune to go in front, Morocco will risk it all at full pelt again. We have to show more strength in the moments when the opposition is pressing us.\u201d\nAnd the website quotes Morocco forward Zakaria Aboukhlal saying: \u201cI am very happy to have reached the last 16. We do not want to stop here. We want to go further and, God willing, we will keep going. We are very happy for Moroccan fans. We see many people who came here from Morocco. I would like to thank them.\n\u201cI am very happy with the way Arabs here are helping one another. We were happy when Saudi Arabia defeated Argentina. We also felt when we defeated Belgium and Canada that other Arab countries were happy for us.\u201d\n\n\n\n 9.00am  \nGermany team director Oliver Bierhoff agrees to leave post after Qatar failure\n\nGermany team director Oliver Bierhoff has become the first casualty of their first-round World Cup exit in Qatar after agreeing to leave his post two years before his contract ends, the DFB said on Tuesday.\nReuters reports that former Germany international Bierhoff, who had been in his post as team director for the last 18 years, was widely criticised following their second consecutive shock early exit at a World Cup. His post was concerned with the public relations aspect of the team as opposed to coaching responsibilities.\n\u201cOliver Bierhoff has won a lot of merits for the DFB,\u201d said DFB president Bernd Neuendorf in a statement. \u201cEven if the last few tournaments lagged behind the sporting goals that had been set, he will be associated with big moments.\u201d\n\nBierhoff played a part in helping Germany win the last of their four World Cup titles in 2014 and Neuendorf said his efforts would not be forgotten.\n\u201cHe will always be linked with the World Cup success in Brazil,\u201d he added. \u201cEven in turbulent times he always followed goals and visions.\u201d\nGermany crashed out of the group stages at both the 2018 and 2022 World Cups, and failed to advance past the round of 16 at Euro 2020. They will be hosting the next European championships in June and July 2024.\n\n\n\n 8.39am  \n\nJacob Steinberg is in Doha for the Guardian, and today he has tackled the subject of England\u2019s teenage sensation \u2013 Jude Bellingham:\nHe was outstanding when England beat Iran in their first game at the World Cup, opening the scoring with a beautiful header, but he was even better against Senegal. It was Bellingham who carried England when they went through a rocky period during the first half against the African champions. He whipped up the fans, urging them to make more noise. He won back possession. Eventually Bellingham drove through the Senegal defence and calmed England\u2019s nerves by setting up the opening goal for Jordan Henderson.\nIt was ridiculous. At one stage Bellingham picked up Harry Kane and told the England captain to put a missed chance behind him. This is not normal teenage behaviour. English football loves its mavericks but Bellingham does not really fall into that category. He is on the path to superstardom but there is no sign of the fame going to his head. It is rare to see him lose his cool on the pitch. He focuses on making the team better and lets his talent create the headlines.\n\nRead more here: Jacob Steinberg \u2013 Jude Bellingham: England teenager with maverick gifts but a steely focus\n\n\n\n\n 8.34am  \n\nMorocco will be hoping for more scenes like this later today.\n\n\n\n\n 8.23am  \n\nSpeaking of Lionel Messi, Reuters has a report from Melbourne this morning that Australia midfielder Cameron Devlin did not play a minute of the World Cup but left Qatar with one of its biggest prizes after exchanging jerseys with Argentina\u2019s number ten after their round of 16 match.\nDevlin, who plays for Hearts in Scotland, swooped after the Socceroos were knocked out 2-1, with Argentine talisman Messi scoring a goal in his 1,000th match.\n\u201cI went on and consoled all the boys first and then shook Messi\u2019s hand,\u201d Devlin told reporters at Sydney airport after arriving back from Qatar.\n\u201cNo one had said anything so I just tried my luck and he said, \u2018I\u2019ll see you inside,\u2019 and that\u2019s what happened. (I wanted) one of the other boys to have the opportunity first, but no one took it, so I thought why not?\u201d said the 24-year-old Devlin.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if (mine) will be on his wall at home or maybe still on the ground in that changing room but I\u2019m not fussed \u2013 it\u2019s more that I got his. I was surprised he even took mine. He definitely wouldn\u2019t know who I am, but he\u2019s a nice enough bloke and a humble enough bloke to still show that respect.\u201d\n\n\n\n 8.13am  \n\nArgentina will be back in action on Friday, in a mouth-watering quarter-final clash with the Netherlands, which will evoke memories of the 1978 final at the Estadio Monumental in Buenos Aires. Former England defender Anita Asante writes for us today that Lionel Messi is thriving off the responsibility of creating a fairytale World Cup swansong:\nIt\u2019s almost like he has a gravitational pull and he himself has a gravitational force, pulling and twisting and managing the movement of the ball like it\u2019s a part of his orbit. He has such a continuity in his movement when he\u2019s on the ball, when he\u2019s dribbling with that close-ball control with such effortless grace. His first touch, which is nearly always sublime, means he doesn\u2019t ever give you an inch of space. Often as a defender you\u2019re counting on putting pressure on at the first touch, if it\u2019s a poor touch you have a chance of stopping them. However his first touch is often so good that defenders are stopped dead in their tracks, and he\u2019s able to just skip by them.\nOne of the only ways to defend against Messi is to do it in numbers. I would want to pull in the defenders around me, drag my wing-back in, have my centre-back close to me, maybe my deep-lying central midfielder offering support and focus on trying to get in the way of those passing lines that he so often finds. But the problem is that he also thrives in those situations. He sucks players towards him. He wants three or four players swarming him with pressure and when that happens he finds the pass. He knows where the space is, he knows where his spare man is, and he\u2019ll find him. If it\u2019s not that, he\u2019s drawing the foul and then we all know what he can do with a free-kick.\n\nRead more here: Anita Asante \u2013 Messi is thriving off the responsibility of creating a fairytale World Cup swansong\n\n\n\n\n 8.07am  \n\nYou were probably off doing something fun, but straight after Brazil\u2019s domineering performance against South Korea yesterday, we locked Max Rushden, Barry Glendenning, Lars Sivertson, Jordan Jarrett-Bryan and Ben Mabley into the Guardian Football Weekly pod until they had properly discussed it for your further delight. You can listen to the episode here \u2026\n\n\n\n\n 8.04am  \nPreamble\n\nWe now know that one side of the draw pits the Netherlands, Argentina, Croatia and Brazil together, while the other features France, England, and whoever comes out on top of today\u2019s two games, which look set to be very entertaining.\nMorocco face Spain at 3pm GMT at the Education City Stadium in Al Rayyan. Spain\u2019s boss described losing to Japan in the group stages as \u201ca punch in the face\u201d, so heaven knows how Luis Enrique would take a defeat to his country\u2019s African neighbours. Loyalties will be tested in the Spanish exclave of Ceuta that sits at the northern tip of Morocco. For their part, it is Morocco\u2019s second ever trip to the second round, and their coach Walid Regragui is bullish about their prospects. \u201cWhy shouldn\u2019t we spring a surprise?\u201d he asked the media yesterday.\nThe Cristiano Ronaldo soap opera rolls back into town for 7pm GMT, where Ronaldo + Portugal face Switzerland. The Swiss emerged from their group after a fiery encounter with Serbia which saw Fifa open more charges against the Serbs amid some ugly scenes from Serbian fans. Switzerland haven\u2019t graced the quarter-finals since hosting the tournament in 1954. Portugal\u2019s coach Fernando Santos said he can\u2019t guarantee Ronaldo will be captain today, and he\u2019ll decide his team when he gets to the stadium. Which sounds \u2026 sub-optimal. \nJoin me for the buildup to all that, plus the fall out from yesterday\u2019s penalty shootout horror show for Japan against Croatia, and Brazil\u2019s \u201cstop, stop, he\u2019s already dead\u201d moment against South Korea. I\u2019ll probably mention England as well along the way. Do drop me a line at martin.belam@theguardian.com\n\n"

There will also be a limit of four drinks per order amid fears that some supporters could binge drink.\nAlcohol is usually restricted in Qatar, a conservative Muslim country, with the few hotel bars allowed typically charging about \u00a312-\u00a315 for a beer or glass of wine.\nIt had been indicated by Nasser al-Khater, the chief executive officer of the 2022 World Cup, that prices for beer in the fan zones and at stadiums would be much lower for fans, with others indicating it would be about \u00a37-\u00a38 per pint.\n\nHowever it has emerged that a 500ml glass of Budweiser, the only official beer of the World Cup, will cost 50 riyals \u2013 about \u00a311.60. A non-alcoholic version will be 30 riyals (\u00a37) and water will cost 10 riyals (\u00a32.30).\nBudweiser has stated that fans, who must prove they are older than 21 to buy alcohol, will be limited to a \u201cmaximum purchase of four Budweiser units per person\u201d. Supporters are also being told: \u201cDrink wiser, cheer better, hydrate between Buds.\u201d\nIn a sign that there may have been discussions with Fifa and the Qatari government before the final pricing policy was reached, the company added in its statement: \u201cBudweiser is proud to be served in compliance with the local rules and regulations by Fifa\u2019s appointed concessionaire.\u201d\nOn Sunday it emerged that Budweiser had been told to move its beer stations to less visible sites outside stadiums, with the New York Times reporting that the order came from Sheikh Jassim bin Hamad bin Khalifa al-Thani, the brother of Qatar\u2019s ruler."

                    "body": "As tournament director of Euro 2024, I am meeting many people from the huge German football base. They are children in jerseys with whom I take selfies, youth coaches who teach rules to their players, presidents of small clubs who have been volunteers for decades. They all love the lightness of football, know its educational power, appreciate its importance to our community.\nWhen the conversation turns to Qatar, however, their tone becomes serious. Many consider missing a World Cup voluntarily for the first time in their lives. In the past, a World Cup was a folk festival, for children a football initiation for life. Today, some amateur clubs think about leaving the beer tables and the screen in the storeroom.\n\nWhat this makes clear to me again is that giving the World Cup to Qatar was a mistake. It doesn\u2019t belong there.\nEven the Fifa procedure was problematic. It was unusual that two tournaments were awarded simultaneously for the first time. Qatar and Russia won the bids, although there was stronger competition. The match schedule in Qatar had to be postponed from summer to winter. The heat in the desert had not been considered at first, although an internal Fifa report had warned against it and also pointed out other deficits of the Qatari bid.\nOther reasons must have been decisive in December 2010. Many of Fifa\u2019s 24 elected officials were later banned, punished or legally prosecuted; two had been suspended before the election.\nAnother lesson from Qatar: in future, human rights must become an indispensable criterion at major sporting events. Qatar has made progress in response to criticism from fans and research by the media by ratifying some agreements under international law and introducing the minimum wage. But gay people are still criminalised, women do not have the same rights as men and freedom of the press and freedom of expression are restricted.\nThe conditions for the migrant workers, thanks to whom the World Cup is possible, have been devastating. Their deaths were accepted and not investigated, their families are not adequately compensated. This is what the human rights experts from the Friedrich Naumann Foundation say. Qatar has admitted abuses.\nAccording to Forbes, the World Cup will cost at least $150bn (\u00a3128bn), which is about 10 times more than the World Cup in Russia, the previous most expensive. In a country the size of Kosovo and with fewer inhabitants than Berlin, there are eight ultra-modern, air-conditioned stadiums.\n\nThere is no fan culture that could benefit from this. Often, not even a thousand spectators come to games in the Qatari professional league. Football is not a popular amateur sport in Qatar and there is practically no opportunity for girls to play. This is also understood as the lack of sustainability of a football tournament.\nThe approach of holding a World Cup in a new region is the right one. In 2010, it was held in Africa for the first time. Before that, I had travelled to South Africa, still a player at the time, to get to know the host country and the circumstances in which I would be playing. A World Cup could also have made a positive contribution to football culture in the Middle East, because there are countries with football traditions there.\nOr if you extend the thought to the entire Arabic-speaking world: Morocco and Algeria. West Germany played Morocco at the 1970 World Cup and lost to Algeria at the 1982 World Cup. Before winning the title in 2014, we had to go to extra time against Algeria in the last 16; the game in Porto Alegre felt like an away game, so many Algerian fans had travelled there. Qatar have never qualified for a World Cup.\n\nNevertheless, this small country won the bid at the first attempt. Many fans from all over the world will have to stop over in neighbouring countries and travel to and from matches. In the stadiums there will be paid influencers to create the atmosphere and PR on social media. This atmosphere does not interest me as a football fan. I would only have flown to Qatar if my job as tournament director required it. Since this is not the case, I am staying at home.\nIn some countries, teams have been asked to boycott the tournament. That\u2019s something everyone has to decide for themselves. I think it\u2019s right that Germany are taking part and I would also be happy if we became world champions. Qatar is an economic partner and energy supplier to the west, Germany maintains diplomatic relations with Qatar and the decision lies 12 years back.\nEveryone has to answer for themselves whether they watch the games on television. I will: the national team is important. The 2024 European Championship in Germany depends on their performance. If the tournament is to be a success, the team have to perform better in Qatar than at the previous two tournaments.\n\nEven though the final is in Doha, I will switch on the TV. In principle, a World Cup is a great event. In sporting terms, a tournament of countries is more unpredictable, with more teams having a chance of winning the title than in the Champions League and many national leagues, where competition is almost frozen. The conditions in Qatar could favour surprises. The rhythm is different, the World Cup takes place in the middle of the season, the teams have almost no preparation.\nIt is possible South America will make a comeback. Maybe an African country will beat a major football nation or a small European country will advance to the final, as Croatia did in 2018. Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo will retire from the global stage. A new star may be born.\nIt doesn\u2019t have to be a contradiction to find the political background of the World Cup questionable and still celebrate a festival. It is not a betrayal of our values to meet friends for a beer and talk boisterously about football and this and that. Another question is whether this World Cup will be the big one. It\u2019s winter in Europe and human rights are not non-negotiable in the host country.\nBut it is a human need to come together. A World Cup is also a community experience among like-minded people. In the special circumstances Europe finds itself, it can strengthen solidarity and resilience.\nPhilipp Lahm\u2019s column was produced in partnership with Oliver Fritsch at Zeit Online, the German online magazine, and is being published in several European countries."

                    "body": "The myriad controversies that have come to dwarf the Qatar World Cup have not kept American fans from turning out in droves, filling bustling public spaces like the Doha corniche and the Souq Wahif clad in USA shirts and stars-and-stripes-patterned regalia. While Fifa has not specified how many tickets it sold directly to US supporters, it has confirmed the United States ranked third in tickets sold by country of residence behind Qatar and Saudi Arabia and ahead of Mexico, the United Kingdom and the United Arab Emirates.  Even as a number of American fans on the ground have expressed concern over the host country\u2019s human rights abuses with respect to migrant laborers, women and the LGBTQ community, the environmental costs of hosting the tournament in the region as well as the persistent allegations of bribery between the Qatar bid committee and Fifa executives, the allure of the World Cup remains as strong as ever with a robust US travelling contingent that belies the sport\u2019s modest popularity back home. Denise Kiernan, an author from Asheville, North Carolina, said that she was grateful for the World Cup\u2019s ability to call attention to Qatar\u2019s dismal human rights record, but hopes the global media will keep its focus on the issues here once the tournament is over.  \u201cI am always bothered by human rights violations wherever they occur,\u201d Kiernan said. \u201cIt did not prevent me from coming to this tournament. I am glad a light is being shone on them. What I am very curious to see is whether or not people who have been following the stories of the treatment of migrant workers, for example \u2013 whether or not their families were properly reimbursed for deaths and injuries, whether or not people are paid \u2013 I want to see whether or not those stories are followed three months, six months, nine months, a year out, to make sure that those issues are resolved. What would bother me is if they were not.\u201d Erin Blankenship, the co-founder of Equal Playing Field, a non-profit initiative dedicated to challenge gender inequality in sport, grew up in California but lives in Cairo. She was bothered by the off-field issues but didn\u2019t hesitate to travel to Qatar for her sixth World Cup, which she gives a mixed review compared to previous editions. \u201cThe Qataris did what the Qatari do very well, right?\u201d Blankenship said. \u201cThey invest in infrastructure and that\u2019s what they\u2019ve really focused on as part of their legacy components. I think the prices are pretty outrageous, but it was all part of what I expected. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of really irrational components, even the basic security protocols that are very annoying. The fact that they draw you out in these long snakey lines with single points of entry and exit to a stadium for 50,000 people. It\u2019s a control thing. I get that, but it doesn\u2019t make sense for the fan experience. That\u2019s a bit frustrating, but otherwise I think it\u2019s been pretty enjoyable.\u201d An almost universal gripe among US fans has been the last-minute ban of beer sales in match areas and in fan zones only two days before the tournament in a stunning reversal. Marcus Brown, a Brooklyn native attending his first World Cup and wearing a Clint Dempsey shirt at Sunday night\u2019s match between Croatia and Canada, was \u201cnot happy\u201d when he learned that beer would be outlawed from inside and around the perimeter of the stadiums. But he said that coming across alcohol has been surprisingly easy thanks to the efforts of a US fan known as Map Man, whose meticulously sourced catalog of the various hotels and restaurants where beer and liquor are sold has been viewed more than 700,000 times, making him a minor cult hero at the tournament.  \u201cTo make the decision to cut off beer two days before the tournament makes it feel like a bait-and-switch from the Qatari government,\u201d Brown said. \u201cThey waited till everybody was here before they announced a decision they probably made up their mind about months or years ago. It\u2019s been easy enough to find a drink as long as you\u2019re willing to pay $20 for a beer, but it would have been nice to have one or two at the stadiums before the game.\u201d For Kiernan, other concerns around the first World Cup to be staged in a conservative Muslim nation, including the criminalization of homosexuality in Qatar, have not been a problem as she\u2019s made her way around the city and surrounding stadiums. \u201cEveryone has been incredibly nice and helpful,\u201d she said. \u201cI have had zero problems. I have spent time with various cultures. I have spent time out and about in the city and in the stadiums with gay men. Nothing has been raised or been an issue. I am not saying that doesn\u2019t mean things haven\u2019t happened, but as far as my experiences, it\u2019s been very easy.\u201d But for now, the attention has turned to Tuesday\u2019s match against Iran at the Al Thumama Stadium, where the United States must win to keep their tournament alive and progress to the knockout stage. \u201cI think we were the better team on the pitch [against England], but we didn\u2019t finish,\u201d Kiernan said. \u201cIt\u2019s a young team that plays off each other in interesting ways. I put our fitness, our physicality and our focus up against anyone\u2019s. I want to see them go all the way.\u201d "

                    "body": "Sometimes, during or after a big sporting event, journalists are asked to write a diary-esque piece about their experiences covering said event in whichever country it is being held. It feels like a funny thing to do, to inject yourself into the story when you spend most of your working life deliberately staying out of it. Should you detail your own experiences while visiting and working in that place, or reflect on the actual environment on the ground? In the case of this World Cup, the two options feel discordant.\nThe reason for the cognitive dissonance is that I had an enjoyable time in Qatar. I felt welcome and looked after, and the tournament was well run. I did not see anything that horrified me. And that, in itself, feels deeply uncomfortable. After 12 years of negative press, there is a new narrative emerging from some visitors to the Gulf state. They are saying it\u2019s not that bad after all. They have seen it with their own eyes now and can confirm it.\n\nThis perspective fails to acknowledge the things we do not see. As guests, travelling media are the audience to this production. We are shown the most flattering bits, during a specific period of time when Qatar knew it would be showing itself to the world. On occasion, over the course of my three weeks covering the tournament, I fell into the trap, taking some of what I observed at face value instead of consciously analysing it. I witnessed jovial cross-cultural interactions between Qatari men and touring westerners. I bantered with migrant workers who appeared outwardly happy and grateful to be earning a wage for their families back home. These things may be just as they seem. More often than not, though, there is grey between the black and white. I could reel off facts here about labour exploitation and other human rights abuses. But it was mainly a feeling.\n\nI felt it each time a worker \u2013 sometimes two \u2013 opened a door for me every time I entered a room, and then left it, and then entered again. Each time there was a subservient smile and a \u201cwelcome, madam\u201d. And each time I felt a grotesque pang of privilege, as if I was somehow a higher class to be tended to. You can try to bridge the gap all you like, by chatting and joking and humanising the person who has just served you something from a fridge you could have opened yourself. Truthfully, though, that process only helps you \u2013 the workers themselves will still be there, standing sentry at their station like servants inside a mansion of disproportionate wealth. Qatar is by no means the only country with a poor track record in this space but, as I am writing about Qatar, I will stick to Qatar.\nSomething I did observe was a general wariness of migrant workers around local police. The police presence in Doha is exhaustive and the pecking order apparent, especially on the roads. One Uber driver taking me to an area near a stadium littered with road blockages was reluctant to venture anywhere near the checkpoints because the police are \u201ccrazy\u201d.\nOn another occasion, while in transit with a colleague, our driver briefly pulled over to clarify our directions. An officer approached and demanded the driver\u2019s licence, which he handed over, before being directed to drop us off and return. It felt tense. I asked in English what was happening; the officer said the driver was not allowed on this part of the road. We requested that the licence be returned and eventually it was. It is difficult not to conclude that there would have been some consequence had two western journalists not been present.\n\nThe insidious nature of all of this is clear in the way we hardly even noticed it, especially once the tournament began. The pre-tournament stream of news and commentary about what was happening off the pitch slowed as journalists shifted their focus to the football. I was guilty of this, too. The workload at these events can be all-encompassing, and the group stage was gripping \u2013 from the casual brilliance of Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 and Lionel Messi to the rise of Asian and African nations. The Socceroos were, of course, compelling, and I had a front-row seat and regular access to the team. In that sense, I felt simultaneously closer to the action than most Australians and also further away, given the low number of travelling fans and the wild celebrations back home.\nI also felt incredibly safe. In saying that, I do not have insight into what it is like on the ground as a member of the LGBTQ+ community. I do have insight into being a woman, and was advised by the Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade that if I was sexually assaulted I should not report it to the police \u2013 but to the Australian embassy instead \u2013 because I could be prosecuted for engaging in what the state deemed to be extramarital sex.\nAs ever, the atmosphere outside the World Cup bubble is different. People are doing more normal things. Some are obscenely rich, many more are very poor. Some say they are happy, others not. There are hardly any Qatari citizens. Some of those Qatari citizens drink alcohol at international hotels; they are always groups of men. And this is where it is difficult to draw conclusions as a foreigner. I do not speak local languages and was not there nearly long enough to form a concrete understanding of the country\u2019s societal intricacies. I also have no certainty that migrant workers would feel comfortable telling westerners about their experiences. I can only come away with my own: one that was comfortable to the point of feeling uncomfortable."

That pint hurled at you isn\u2019t going to feel nearly as pleasant in single digit temperatures, is it? These are strange times and a strange World Cup, happening out of season in a nation state the size of Yorkshire, and with as much attention (rightly) focused on the human rights violations of its host as on the football itself. Its moral murkiness notwithstanding, I am tentatively looking forward to the tournament, particularly as Wales are making their first appearance in the tournament in 64 years (waka, waka, eh, eh)! Still, I do sympathise with those who are desperate to skirt the thing, because that is going to be harder than ever. Usually the World Cup\u2019s position smack-bang in the middle of summer means the football-loathers can at least head out into the sunshine to avoid it. In winter there\u2019s no such escape. In its early stages this World Cup will cram in four matches a day, pretty much uninterrupted from 10am to 9pm, and that\u2019s without accounting for highlights programmes, news reports and features packages on the One Show where they have a border collie predict how far England will go. Oh, and a prominent position on the Guardian homepage (Though, remember, there is a hide button). But the Guide is here for you, dear football-averse reader.

                    "body": "In November 2005, my father scored last-minute tickets to the Australia v Uruguay playoff and took me and my sister to see the match that would result in the Socceroos\u2019 qualification to the 2006 World Cup in Germany.\nAs the Olympic stadium shook like an earthquake and the people around me converged into a giant hugging mass, 11-year-old me thought this was the best night of my life. Nothing has topped it since.\nI vividly remember the following months of anticipation ahead of the Socceroos\u2019 first game in Kaiserslautern; reading every Australian edition of 4-4-2 magazine cover to cover, learning obscure stats about every player in the squad. I remember watching the TV as Australia were drawn in a group with Japan, Brazil and Croatia, and every day after that calculating in my head how Australia would progress from such a difficult group.\n\nThat was a golden era for the Socceroos, but even as Australia\u2019s squad has changed over the years, with fewer players from Europe\u2019s top leagues, every four years I would get just as excited as a newer, less experienced generation prepared to represent us on the world stage.\nNothing rivals the month of football that gives fans reason to forget about life\u2019s worries, but a large part of the World Cup\u2019s festive feeling is due to anticipation. As years turn into months, teams qualify, official balls and kits are released and, in the final weeks, plans are made on exactly how to watch games. \n\nThen there is the sense of expectation. Of course Australia have never been real contenders to reach the latter stages of this tournament, but there has always been a glimmer of hope something could be achieved, a sense they could make a mark in some way on the world stage \u2013 and they have in the past.\nAustralia\u2019s dramatic late comeback against Japan in 2006 to win their first ever World Cup finals match and the controversial defeat to Italy in the knockout stage gave the football world reason to sit up and take notice. In 2014, Tim Cahill\u2019s stunning equaliser against the Netherlands, and the four or so minutes the Socceroos were in the lead against the previous tournament\u2019s runners-up made it feel like Australia were on top of the footballing world.\nThese are the kind of rich, memorable moments that have been etched into Australian sporting folklore, so it is perhaps strange that this time around I am feeling rather unexcited about the Socceroos and this World Cup.\nIn many ways this is unsurprising. Qatar\u2019s abysmal human rights record is well documented, and with the knowledge that at least 6,500 migrant workers have died on World Cup projects, even the most euphoric moments will be tarred with the image of a grieving family picking up their son in a coffin from Kathmandu airport.\nThen, of course, there is the realisation this World Cup is actually happening \u2013 a long process that began with disbelief following the December 2010 announcement that Qatar\u2019s hosting bid had won, then widespread concern for player safety in the intolerable Middle-Eastern summer, followed by an outrageous decision to move the tournament to the local winter and upend world football\u2019s calendar. There were also revelations and allegations of corruption within Fifa.\nFans around the world are united in their struggle to comprehend all that, but for Australians, there is an added layer \u2013 Qatar\u2019s victory came directly at the expense of Australia, which had submitted its own, ultimately failed, bid. It would later be revealed that Australia, despite its expenditure of $46m on the process, never had a chance of winning.\nOn paper Australia 2022 would have been a great option. As a teenager, I became drunk on the idea of a World Cup in my own country. I spent money from my job at Blockbuster on official bid towels and jumpers, and was shattered when that dream evaporated.\nCan you imagine the party we\u2019d have put on for the world, had we been afforded an end-of-year, summertime tournament? Hosting it in Qatar feels less about fan experience and communal joy, and more like Fifa giving a middle finger to football fans. Surely those fans arriving at tent cities this week who are being asked to pay $21 for beers, and the reporters being threatened by local authorities, might also be wondering what could have been.\nThe decision also robbed Australia of a decade of investment in the game . It has been a rough few years on these shores, and I\u2019m ashamed to admit that, after waking up countless times at unsocial hours to watch a lacklustre national team squander chance after chance to qualify automatically, I became convinced it would be a good thing to miss out on this World Cup.\nThe playoff triumph against Peru has gone down in history, thanks to Andrew Redmayne\u2019s goalline antics, but ultimately that dramatic shootout win has just delayed the reckoning the national team still needs to have. And while we wait for that to happen, I\u2019ll settle for watching this year\u2019s competition from afar, draped in dystopian merchandise for Australia\u2019s doomed 2022 bid and dreaming of a very different World Cup."

                    "body": "The UK foreign secretary, James Cleverly, has been criticised for telling gay football fans they should show respect to Qatar, which criminalises their sexuality, when attending the World Cup in the emirate.\nCleverly said Qatar was willing to make compromises to allow people it would normally persecute to attend the tournament, which kicks off on 20 November. On Tuesday, the prominent British LGBTQ campaigner Peter Tatchell claimed he had been arrested in Qatar for highlighting the country\u2019s stance.\nCleverly said: \u201cI have spoken to the Qatari authorities in the past about gay football fans going to watch the World Cup and how they will treat our fans and international fans. They want to make sure that football fans are safe, secure and enjoy themselves. And they know that that means they are going to have to make some compromises in terms of what is an Islamic country with a very different set of cultural norms to our own.\n\u201cOne of the things I would say for football fans is, you know, please do be respectful of the host nation. They are trying to ensure that people can be themselves and enjoy the football, and I think with a little bit of flex and compromise at both ends, it can be a safe, secure and exciting World Cup.\u201d\nThe broadcaster and former England footballer Gary Lineker asked: \u201cWhatever you do, don\u2019t do anything gay. Is that the message?\u201d\nLineker, whose 10 World Cup goals make him the joint-eighth goalscorer in tournament\u2019s history, said recently he hoped a Premier League player felt sufficiently comfortable to come out during this year\u2019s competition to send a strong message to Qatar.\nLucy Powell, the shadow digital, culture, media and sport secretary, called Cleverly\u2019s comments \u201cshockingly tone-deaf\u201d.\nShe said: \u201cSport should be open to all. Many fans will feel they can\u2019t attend this tournament to cheer on their team because of Qatar\u2019s record on human rights, workers and LGBT+ rights. The government should be challenging Fifa on how they\u2019ve put fans in this position, and ensuring the full safety of all fans attending, not defending discriminatory values.\u201d\nCleverly said he had not spoken with the Qatari government about the case of Tatchell, who was stopped in the Qatari capital, Doha, on Tuesday while staging a protest over LGBTQ rights. Cleverly told LBC radio he understood that the campaigner had been questioned and was being supported by the Foreign Office\u2019s consular team.\nHe said he would attend the World Cup if his diary allowed, and he criticised the Labour leader, Keir Starmer, for saying he would refuse to do so because of Qatar\u2019s record on homosexuality and other human rights issues. The Labour Welsh first minister, Mark Drakeford, reportedly plans to attend the tournament.\nTatchell hit back at Cleverly, claiming that attending the tournament would amount to \u201ccolluding with a homophobic, sexist and racist regime\u201d. He said: \u201cThe UK government must use its public voice to condemn the appalling human rights abuses carried out daily by the Qatari regime.\n\u201cUnless we all speak out, Qatar will have achieved its goal of sportswashing its appalling reputation during the World Cup. Cleverly has an opportunity to highlight the abuses being carried out by the regime. All fans, not just LGBTs, should boycott the World Cup and use their social media to amplify the shocking human rights abuses by the Qatari state.\u201d\nThe Liberal Democrat MP Layla Moran said: \u201cThe World Cup should be a celebration of the beautiful game; instead it\u2019s being used by countries like Qatar to sportswash their atrocious human rights records. Any UK officials who attend should be using their position to highlight human rights abuses, not endorsing the regime.\u201d"

Have those changes worked and how likely are they to be sustained after the tournament? A panel of experts give their view. Geoffrey: \u2018Is it fair play when there is nothing for the workers?\u2019 The World Cup is like a slap in the face of workers. I have spoken to thousands of them. They don\u2019t know their rights; their contracts are violated; there is discriminatory pay, and then there\u2019s the weather. People are working in severe temperatures. They get dehydrated. Workers have been dying in their sleep. These deaths may be caused by the work, and their families should be compensated. At least there is a minimum wage now. Before, there was no way you could complain about your salary, but now you know you should get at least 1,000 rials a month (\u00a3245). The problem is that it is too low. Way too low. How many billions of dollars has Qatar spent on preparations for the World Cup? The minimum wage is a drop in the ocean.  Kafala [a systemunder which workers cannot freely change jobs] was abolished for two or three months only. After that, these powerful Qataris who own big companies complained and the changes were watered down. Now there is a requirement to get your company to approve your resignation. This is like bringing the kafala system again through the back door. The first time I was detained in Qatar was for trying to change my job. I could deal with it because I know my rights, but what about the thousands of workers who don\u2019t know their rights? People have been deported just for trying to change companies. Fifa talks a lot about \u201cfair play\u201d. Is it really fair play when there is nothing for the workers? Yes, a lot of workers got employment but it was under exploitative conditions. I think a country\u2019s human rights record should be part of the evaluation process when awarding a World Cup. For Fifa, it was an afterthought.  Geoffrey, a Kenyan, worked in Qatar for three and a half years. While there, he also worked for the human rights group Equidem as a researcher and advocate for workers\u2019 rights. He was detained three times and has now returned home, where he continues his advocacy work  Max Tu\u00f1\u00f3n: \u2018Now workers can negotiate for better conditions\u2019 Earlier this year, we commissioned a survey among 1,000 low-wage workers, and found that 86% of respondents felt that the labour reforms had positively affected their lives. Changes to the kafala system have led to labour mobility. Now workers can negotiate for better conditions, and employers are incentivised to provide them in order to attract and retain talent. Legislation has also been introduced on the minimum wage, on protecting outdoor workers during the summer months, and on the election of migrant worker representatives within companies. Over the past five years, the government has engaged closely with the ILO [International Labour Organization], international trade unions, NGOs and others. Notably, staff from the global unions are based with us here in Doha, raising awareness among workers, and helping them to resolve the problems they face.  There is universal acknowledgment that the work is not complete. Among our top priorities, there\u2019s the need to address the retaliation by some employers against workers who wish to change jobs; to streamline access to justice and the recovery of due wages; and to ensure that the law protecting domestic workers is fully implemented. We are all impatient to see the reforms fully applied and enforced, but we also recognise that we are dealing with new laws and new institutions, and changing practices that have been deeply entrenched for decades. The World Cup was never the finish line, but rather a key milestone in Qatar\u2019s longer-term strategy, which includes competing for skilled workers in an increasingly global market.  Max Tu\u00f1\u00f3n is the head of the ILO project office in Qatar. The ILO has been working in partnership with the Qatari authorities since 2018 to introduce labour reforms.  Construction manager: \u2018All they want is to tick boxes\u2019 The companies I work for are just getting away with everything. There are many people now walking around Qatar who have lost their jobs, haven\u2019t received their end-of-service benefits or months of salary. I\u2019ve seen a lot of good people suffer and it\u2019s absolutely linked to the World Cup. Qatar wanted to build everything as cheaply as possible. All the big contractors were fighting one another to win the work. They were winning jobs at any cost. As Qatar started slowing down its construction [before the World Cup], all these contractors then started to face problems \u2026 and where they save their money is by not paying suppliers or our salaries and end of services.  All the government and supreme committee [the local body organising the World Cup] want to do is tick boxes, show a good report and just hope and pray that no one finds out. I\u2019ve worked on a number of World Cup projects and we had good workers\u2019 accommodation and bad workers\u2019 accommodation. We did all our inspections at the good accommodation. This is how it works. There\u2019s no accountability. The government doesn\u2019t enforce its own laws effectively. They did allow workers to change jobs \u2026 but the bad companies were losing all their workers, so the owners went to the government and said, \u201cStop this.\u201d  It\u2019s 50% the contractors\u2019 fault and 50% the government\u2019s fault. The country is too small for them not to know what\u2019s going on. Once the World Cup\u2019s finished, that\u2019s it. The eyes of the world will no longer be on Qatar. They\u2019ll just go back to how they were.  Name withheld to protect the contributor\u2019s identity  Vani Saraswathi: \u2018The true test will happen after the World Cup\u2019 Qatar has made significant strides in terms of labour reforms in the past five years. In a region hostile to civil society interventions or criticism, Qatar has engaged with its critics. No doubt the World Cup was effective leverage to compel it to do so. When we speak of reforms, we have two main components \u2013 in principle, what\u2019s been implemented and, in practice, what\u2019s been enforced. Much of our concern is with the latter.  The removal of the no-objection certificate [which workers required from their employer in order to change jobs] was by far the most important of the changes. It gave migrant workers an opportunity to tap into the local job market for better opportunities. For the first few months, the job change process was almost seamless, until employers started pushing back. Other parts of the kafala system, particularly the power of employers to report workers as \u201cabsconding\u201d, were misused to keep workers in check, negating to a large degree the effectiveness of the reforms.  Advocates for Qatar keep arguing \u2013 weakly, in my opinion \u2013 that cultural change will take longer and what must be appreciated are the changes in law. This is not about culture but selective reforms that still give power to the employer. The true test, and the real opportunity for meaningful change, will happen after the World Cup. The relentless \u2013 and, at times, unfair \u2013 scrutiny Qatar has faced in the last 12 years means reforms and reactions have been to primarily ward off criticism, without focusing on buy-in and behavioural change locally. As a result, the powerful business owners cock a snook at the reforms and continue unchecked with their exploitative practices. I\u2019d like to believe Qatar will not regress on its legal commitments post-2022, but if they are to be enforced, it will require dialogue at the grassroots level to show that ensuring the human rights of migrant workers and business profitability is not a zero-sum game.  Vani Saraswathi is the editor-at-large of the website for Migrant Rights, an organisation that advocates for migrant rights across the Gulf  Pete Pattisson: \u2018The system is effectively still in place\u2019 Qatar\u2019s two flagship labour reforms are the introduction of a minimum wage and the abolition of the kafala system. The first is a scandal, the second largely a failure. The minimum wage is the equivalent of about \u00a31 an hour. This is poverty pay, in one of the richest countries in the world per capita. Employers must also provide food and board, or an additional allowance to pay for them. The food allowance is about \u00a32 a day. The abolition of kafala worked for a few months, but today the system is effectively still in place. On my recent visits to Qatar, almost every worker I spoke to said they were unable to change jobs, leaving them at the mercy of abusive employers. Both reforms only came into force 10 years after Qatar won the right to host the World Cup, and long after most of the stadiums and infrastructure were completed.  That is not to say nothing has changed, but every claim of reform the Qatari authorities make has to be heavily caveated. New workers\u2019 accommodation has been built, but many thousands still live in squalid, overcrowded dorms. The World Cup organising committee has introduced a scheme to partly reimburse the huge illegal fees workers are forced to pay to secure their jobs, but it only benefits a fraction of Qatar\u2019s low-wage workforce. Regulations have been put in place to limit labourers\u2019 exposure to the searing summer heat, but the authorities have done little to investigate the sudden and unexplained deaths of thousands of workers. Countless families of deceased workers have been left without compensation. The Qatari authorities and Fifa claim the World Cup will leave a lasting legacy of better workers\u2019 rights in the country and the region. That seems unlikely. Some of the reforms have stalled even before a ball has been kicked.  Pete Pattisson has investigated the treatment of low-wage workers in Qatar for almost a decade "

                    "body": "A large majority of people in Britain think the World Cup should not be held in Qatar because of its position on LGBTQ+ rights. Homosexuality is illegal in Qatar, attracting punishments of up to seven years in prison. Despite this and other serious human rights concerns, Fifa members voted in 2010 to award the 2022 tournament to the Gulf state. A survey found that 62% of British people believe Qatar\u2019s stance on gay rights alone should have been enough to bar it from hosting, with support for that position consistent across age, gender and political persuasion. Just 24% believe the country\u2019s laws should not have been a factor, with 14% unsure. In addition, only 43% of Britons think the England and Wales teams are right to participate in the tournament given Qatar\u2019s anti-gay laws. Thirty-nine per cent of all those asked believe the teams should not take part, while 18% said they didn\u2019t know. The World Cup, rescheduled for winter to avoid Qatar\u2019s overwhelming summer heat, kicks off on 20 November with the hosts facing Ecuador. The survey, conducted between 1 and 3 November by Public First for More in Common, also asked 2,030 adults whether Keir Starmer, the Labour leader, was right in planning to boycott the tournament over Qatar\u2019s human rights record. Sixty-nine per cent of respondents said he was right, with 12% disagreeing. Starmer was asked by LBC radio last month whether he planned to attend, and said neither he nor any party colleagues would be there, even if England got to the final. \u201cI\u2019d love to but the human rights record is such I wouldn\u2019t go. That would be the position of the Labour party,\u201d he said. The campaign group Human Rights Watch said last month that Qatari residents risked persecution if they stood up for LGBTQ+ rights, while concerns have also been raised about the safety of foreign gay fans or others showing solidarity by carrying a rainbow flag, for example. The UK foreign secretary, James Cleverly, has been criticised for urging gay fans to show respect to Qatar. He said last month: \u201cIt is important when you are a visitor to a country that you respect the culture of your host nation.\u201d In response, the TV presenter and former footballer Gary Lineker tweeted: \u201cWhatever you do, don\u2019t do anything Gay. Is that the message?\u201d Lucy Powell, the shadow sport secretary, called Cleverly\u2019s comments \u201cshockingly tone-deaf\u201d, adding: \u201cThe government should be challenging Fifa on how they\u2019ve put fans in this position, and ensuring the full safety of all fans attending, not defending discriminatory values.\u201d The gay rights campaigner Peter Tatchell accused Cleverly of \u201ccolluding with a homophobic, sexist and racist regime\u201d. The poll found that 44% thought Cleverly was right to call on fans to be respectful and 34% felt he was wrong, with 24% undecided. Cleverly has said he intends to attend the tournament. Luke Tryl, the UK director of More in Common, said: \u201cThe British public clearly thinks that Qatar\u2019s position on LGBT rights was a reason not to award the World Cup to that country \u2026 The clear message from the public to Fifa is that in picking future tournament venues, human rights considerations should be front and centre.\u201d,"

                    "body": "The Qatar World Cup is failing to live up to promises on reducing its carbon footprint, a new report has warned, creating another problem for the tournament. Organisers have claimed that the 32-team showpiece will be the first \u201ccarbon neutral\u201d World Cup, meaning any emissions would be limited and offset. However Carbon Market Watch (CMW), a not-for-profit organisation which works closely with the European Union, has examined the organisers\u2019 plans and says projected emissions have likely been underreported, with the footprint created from building seven new stadiums of particular concern.  \u201cIt would be great to see the climate impact of Fifa World Cups being drastically reduced but the carbon neutrality claim that is being made is simply not credible,\u201d said Gilles Dufrasne of CMW, author of the analysis. \u201cDespite a lack of transparency, the evidence suggests that the emissions from this World Cup will be considerably higher than expected by the organisers, and the carbon credits being purchased to offset these emissions are unlikely to have a sufficiently positive impact on the climate.\u201d Central to CMW\u2019s complaint is its calculation that carbon emissions created by the new stadiums could be as much as eight times higher than the figures contained in Qatar\u2019s analysis. The CMW report claims the hosts have made a calculation which spreads a stadium\u2019s carbon footprint over its entire lifetime, something the report describes as \u201cproblematic\u201d. \u201cThese stadiums have been constructed specifically for the World Cup,\u201d CMW said. \u201cFuture extensive use of so many stadiums in such a small geographical space is uncertain, especially when considered against the fact that Doha had only one major stadium before it was awarded the World Cup.\u201d  Further criticisms related to plans to absorb emissions with a large-scale \u201ctree and turf nursery\u201d. The CMW report claims this idea is \u201cnot credible\u201d because any absorption is \u201cunlikely to be permanent in these artificial and vulnerable green spaces\u201d. It also questions the carbon credit system Qatar plans to use to offset remaining emissions at the end of the event. The new format, known as the Global Carbon Council (GCC), was originally authorised by Qatari authorities and has different criteria to other established credit systems. It is being used in relation to only two other projects worldwide and has sold 130,000 credits. A minimum of 1.8 million are expected to be sold to the World Cup. A spokesperson for Qatar\u2019s Supreme Committee, responsible for the delivery of the World Cup, said the country\u2019s commitment to a carbon-neutral World Cup should be \u201crecognised, rather than criticised\u201d and that the CMW criticisms were \u201cspeculative and inaccurate\u201d.  It said that many trees from the nursery were endemic to the region, drought tolerant and would be replanted around stadium areas after the tournament. The GCC credit system, it said, was approved by a number of bodies, including the International Civilian Aviation Organisation, a UN agency. Fifa disputes the CMW analysis, saying it is not appropriate to calculate stadium emissions based only on their use at the World Cup and that \u201cdetailed legacy plans and business models\u201d for stadiums\u2019 use after the tournament are in place. \u201cThe organisers have pledged to measure, mitigate and offset all Fifa World Cup 2022 greenhouse gas emissions, while advancing low-carbon solutions in Qatar and the region,\u201d a spokesperson said. \u201cThus, at no point has Fifa misled its stakeholders, as is claimed by the report. \u201cFifa is fully aware of the risks that mega-events pose on the economy, the natural environment and on people and communities. [It] has been making efforts to tackle those impacts and use opportunities that arise to mitigate the negative impacts and maximise the positive impacts of its iconic tournament.\u201d"

Barney Ronay takes a look at the great man.\n\n\n\n\n 2.10pm  \n\n\u201cI just got thinking about Monty Python\u2019s wonderful Philosopher\u2019s football match sketch,\u201d says Phil Grey. \u201cWouldn\u2019t it be great if, when the ref blows the whistle to start the match, all the players just stand around thinking about whether or not they should be in Qatar playing football??\nIt would be better than most of ITV\u2019s output.\n\n\n\n 2.07pm  \n\nNathan Ake says Netherlands will not take Senegal lightly despite Sadio Mane\u2019s absence from their World Cup opener on Monday.\nThe Bayern Munich forward will miss the World Cup after undergoing surgery on an injury picked up prior to the tournamnent.\u201cIt\u2019s going to be very tough,\u201d Ake said. \u201cSenegal has good players and very strong strikers, even without Mane. Missing the World Cup due to an injury is very annoying, not only for him. Everyone wants to see the top players at work here. The fact that Mane is not there is therefore a loss for this World Cup,\u201d he said, echoing what captain Virgil van Dijk had said earlier. But we still have to prepare for a very tough job, because Senegal remains very strong. We\u2019ve analysed them well.\u201d\n\n\n\n 2.03pm  \n\nHow will the Socceroos get on? Emma Kemp takes a look. \n\n\n\n\n 1.58pm  \n\n\u201cI wonder am I alone here in having decided to not watch this World Cup?\u201d David Flynn asks. \u201cHaving watched the majority of every World Cup since 1990, it\u2019s a weird feeling because I absolutely love it but the more that was reported, the more it became apparent that I wouldn\u2019t be able to enjoy it. I suppose that\u2019s a sign of why a free and independent press is so necessary, so thanks for that. I guess.\u201d\n\n\n\n 1.55pm  \n\nThere might be a few matches where they can fit that in \u2026\n\n\n\n\n 1.54pm  \n\nFill your boots tomorrow \u2026\n\n\n\n\n 1.44pm  \n\nIn some non-beer World Cup news, Spain have needed to call up Alejandro Balde as a replacement for the injured Jose Luis Gaya.\n\n\n\n\n 1.37pm  \n\nSend Tom Davies your Stockport pub recommendations for the weekend. He is not a Bud Zero man.\n\n\n\n 1.33pm  \n\nHello! Like all good Friday afternoons in the office, the chat focuses mainly about beer. I have already found out where Tom Davies is drinking tomorrow prior to a football match but comrades in Qatar will find it a touch harder to get hold of some amber nectar.\n\n\n\n 1.28pm  \n\nRight, so Will\u2019s back from his red-hot 90s football chat and hurriedly ingested sarnie, so I\u2019ll hand you back to his more than capable hands. Bye.\n\n\n\n 1.24pm  \n\nThe Football Supporters\u2019 Association has put out a statement on the beer ban:\n\n\n\n\n 1.06pm  \n\nWales have just started today\u2019s training session, in apparently slightly cooler weather than yesterday (a mere 31c), shortly after 4pm local time. All 26 players are out there \u2013 including Joe Allen who is on his own programme to turbo-charge his recovery from a hamstring injury \u2013 and a phalanx of photographers training their lenses solely, predictably, tediously on Gareth Bale. Aaron Ramsey is sporting a peroxide blond Barnet as per 2016.\n\n\nUpdated at 1.12pm GMT\n\n\n 12.54pm  \n\nThere\u2019s plenty of things Twitter seems struggling to cope with at the moment \u2013 such as treating employees with a modicum of decency \u2013 and its recent turmoil could mean the platform will struggle to cope with World Cup-related abuse, Kick it Out has warned. Sanjay Bhandari, the anti-racism campaign\u2019s chair, said: \u201cI am deeply concerned that the reduction in the trust and safety team and the departure of the leader of that team will be taken as a bright green light for hate \u2026 I fear that industrial-scale levels of hate during the World Cup will go unchecked by Twitter.\u201d\nHere\u2019s the story:\n\n\nUpdated at 12.57pm GMT\n\n\n 12.45pm  \n\nThe one good thing about hosting a tarnished World Cup in November and December, from a UK perspective, is that other football is still going on. And this weekend has plenty to entice: the WSL\u2019s big game has Arsenal taking on Manchester United at the Emirates Stadium on Saturday, while Stamford Bridge hosts Chelsea v Tottenham on Sunday.\nAnd there\u2019s some tasty EFL action too, starting with Portsmouth v Derby tonight with Exeter v Ipswich and Burton v Plymouth among other big League One games. League Two\u2019s game of the day pits fourth-placed in-form Bradford against third-placed Northampton while the leaders, Leyton Orient, visit Stockport.\nAre you planning to watch more, or less, live football in the next month or will the World Cup tempt you back to the sofa? \n\n\n\n 12.39pm  \n\nSome Fifa politics now, with Reuters reporting that Germany\u2019s decision not to back the president Gianni Infantino\u2019s re-election next year was a result of the governing body\u2019s handling of human rights issues in Qatar and its failure to take a stand on Iran, German Football Association (DFB) chief Bernd Neuendorf said on Friday.\nNeuendorf said the DFB\u2019s decision not to back Infantino, set to be re-elected for a third term in March, was because the German federation had been \u201cirritated\u201d by a number of issues related to the World Cup.\n\u201cWe indeed took this decision [not to back Infantino]. It was not easy but at the end of the day that was the decision because we believe we have to make a statement,\u201d Neuendorf told a news conference.\n\u201cInfantino already has the support of continental confederations and his re-election is very likely. But after his letter two weeks ago that human rights should not play a role and we should focus on football we were considerably irritated,\u201d Neuendorf added.\n\u201cThere were other things as well that irritated us with FIFA. The ban of the slogan for the Danish shirt because \u2018human rights for all\u2019 was written on it.\u201d\n\n\n\n 12.33pm  \n\nLet\u2019s talk about France: you can never really be sure whether you\u2019re going to get feast or famine with Les Bleus, and the buildup to this year\u2019s campaign has its fair share of clouds. Jonathan Liew looks at their talents and their problems here:\n\n\n\n\n 12.29pm  \n\nThanks Will, and that interview with said 90s Premier League cult hero promises to be a cracker. But no more spoilers.\nIn the meantime, here\u2019s the last of our exhaustive team guides \u2013 Luis Eduardo Inzaurralde explains why hopes are high for Uruguay\u2019s blend of youth and experience. I rated them a lot four years ago and there\u2019s promises to be another intriguing campaign.\n\n\n\n\n 12.24pm  \n\nI am off to interview a 90\u2019s Premier League cult hero, so Tom Davies will be here in my stead to discuss the beer ramifications. I might even fit in a sandwich, too.\n\n\n\n 12.22pm  \n\nWatch the England press conference LIVE!\n\n\n\n\n 12.16pm  \nManchester United ban and take legal action Ronaldo\n\nCristiano Ronaldo has almost certainly played his last game for Manchester United. Jamie Jackson has the latest on the club taking legal action against the forward for breach of contract.\n\n\n\n\n 12.15pm  \n\n\u201cOn paper, the 2018 champions should be strong favourites to become the first team since Brazil in 1962 to retain the trophy. The raw talent in this generation of French male footballers could sustain not simply a successful title defence but an entire dynasty. However Deschamps\u2019s squad arrives in Qatar beset by doubts: some real, some confected, some occupying that existentially French space of catastrophes that do not really exist yet.\u201d\nJonathan Liew on France.\n\n\n\n\n 12.02pm  \n\nTraining in Qatar is a touch warm.\n\n\n\n\n 11.51am  \n\nWatch the Wales press conference LIVE!\n\n\n\n\n 11.48am  \n\n\u201cGood Morning Will, good morning everyone!\u201d Good morning Em Jackson. \u201cWith a beer ban in stadia in an 11th hour u-turn, how willing would you be to do something like hold hands with your partner (either male or female), wave a rainbow flag embossed with your nation\u2019s crest on etc?\u201dLet\u2019s face it, this was supposedly a summer World Cup as well \u2026 the words \u201cbreach of contract\u201d appear not to translate well in Doha.\u201cJules Rimet is steaming, 30 days of beer-hurt, never stop me dreaming, over a pint of coke\u201d \u2013 with apologies to Messrs Lightning Seeds, Baddiel and Skinner.\u201d \n\n\n\n 11.47am  \n\nFor those of a Socceroos persuasion \u2026\n\n\n\n\n 11.40am  \n\nIntriguing that my career is now just writing about the availability of beer. Camra, I am available for freelance beer-based commissions. \n\n\n\n 11.38am  \n\nBudweiser have now deleted their \u201cWell, this is awkward\u201d tweet. \nSean Ingle writes: \u201cFootball\u2019s governing body will now be looking nervously over its shoulders at the prospect of legal action from Budweiser, which has a $75m (\u00a363m) sponsorship agreement with Fifa, and is likely to regard this as a major breach of contract.\u201d\nNothing like a bit of legal action to get us all in the mood for the World Cup.\n\n\n\n 11.33am  \n\nSean Ingle has the full story on the beer ban.\n\n\n\n\n 11.29am  \n\nMaybe some David Squires genius will distract from this ludicrous tournament. Actually, it is just another reminder how how silly it is that Qatar have it. But it is very well done.\n\n\n\n\n 11.25am  \n\nFifa\u2019s statement on the booze ban offers zero clarity on why the decision has been made at this late point. Zero transparency from them on this matter. What\u2019s new? \n\n\n\n 11.24am  \n\nFor beer connoisseurs, the good news is that Bud Zero will still be available to purchase. I cannot underestimate how bad a drink that must be.\n\n\n\n 11.21am  \n\nTo be fair to Qatar and Fifa, they have really set their stall out early to make this look like it will be the worst World Cup in history. By setting the bar so low, anything better than that will be a success. \n\n\n\n 11.18am  \nAlcohol sales at stadiums banned\n\nFifa have confirmed the news, as expected, that fans will no longer be able to buy alcoholic beverages inside the stadium perimeters, as previously promised. \nHere is Fifa\u2019s statement. \n\n\n\n\n 11.17am  \n\nGet quizzing.\n\n\n\n\n 11.16am  \n\nI am sure you have been waiting to find out how the Guardian will be covering the World Cup. Here is everything you need to know: \nI am particularly excited by the weekly Karen Carney column.\n\n\n\n\n 11.08am  \nManchester United take 'appropriate steps' over Ronaldo interview\n\nManchester United have \u2018initiated appropriate steps\u2019 after the airing of Cristiano Ronaldo\u2019s moany interview with Piers Morgan. The forward made numerous critical comments about club\u2019s coaches (past and present), the owners and the general setup. \nA club statement read: \u201cManchester United has this morning initiated appropriate steps in response to Cristiano Ronaldo\u2019s recent media interview. We will not be making further comment until this process reaches its conclusion.\u201d\n\n\n\n 11.00am  \n\nJames Maddison was again the only player to train away from the main group as England continued to gear up for their World Cup opener.\nThe Three Lions kick-off Group B against Iran on Monday, before facing the United States and neighbours Wales.\nMaddison hopes to be fit for the start of the tournament after a positive scan on the knee complaint which saw him substituted in the first half of Leicester\u2019s win at West Ham last weekend.\nThe midfielder came out for the pre-session huddle on Friday but worked away from the main group for the second straight day due to what the Football Association called load management. PA Media\n\n\n\n 10.57am  \n\nHow will your team do in the World Cup? Here is your chance to send in your views \u2026\n\n\n\n\n 10.54am  \n\nBudweiser do not seem particularly pleased by the latest beer-related events \u2026\n\n\n\n\n 10.50am  \n\nObviously, the main problem is not that alcohol sales will be banned near the stadiums, it is that the Qataris have made a last-minute U-turn on something that had been agreed. How can people have confidence in anything they have said of welcoming LGBTQ+ community when they are changing their minds on other matters? \n\n\n\n 10.48am  \n\nPhil Foden is aiming to prove what he can do on the world stage. Will Gareth Southgate\u2019s tactics help or hinder the Manchester City forward?\n\n\n\n\n 10.37am  \n\nFrance midfielder Adrien Rabiot wants Les Bleus to stick together in order to redeem themselves following their Euro 2020 failure when they lost to Switzerland in the round of 16. \n\u201cThe most important point is we have to stay united. So we don\u2019t look outside the group for things that can harm our morale. We have the potential to do better than we did in the Euro,\u201d Rabiot said ahead to their opening World Cup match against Australia. \u201cIt is true that we have a lot of luxury this time around. We live in this little bubble. In the Euro it was mid-COVID with a lot of restrictions and it made daily life difficult.\u201d\n\n\n\n 10.32am  \nQatar accused of \u2018deafening silence\u2019 over plans for migrant workers\u2019 centre\n\nThe trade union leading attempts to improve conditions for migrant workers in Qatar has warned that a positive World Cup legacy is unlikely after proposals for a migrant workers\u2019 centre and wider reform were met with \u201cdeafening silence\u201d by government officials. Paul MacInnes has the exclusive. \n\n\n\n\n 10.29am  \n\nPaul MacInnes takes a look at the fan experience in Qatar. I wouldn\u2019t fancy it myself but each to their own. \n\n\n\n\n 10.25am  \n\nTake your mind off this beer news by reading Sid Lowe\u2019s big old natter with Athletic Bilbao and Spain goalie Unai Simon. \n\n\n\n\n 10.19am  \n\nBeer will no longer be sold within the perimeters of Qatar 2022 stadiums, according to reports. The announcement is imminent and will come two days before the first match and will add to the controversy over the hosting of this tournament.\nThe decision will cause problems between Fifa and sponsor Budweiser, who we must all assume will be irked by this last-minute change of plans.\n\n\nUpdated at 10.19am GMT\n\n\n 10.06am  \n\nThere is an Englishman at the World Cup who is not part of the Three Lions setup. Canada\u2019s head coach is John Herdman, who has managed both the country\u2019s men\u2019s and women\u2019s teams.\n\n\n\n\n 9.57am  \n\nSome kind person has written about \u2018Everything you need to know\u2019 about Qatar. Fair play to them. \n\n\n\n\n 9.54am  \n\nSadio Mane is out of the tournament after requiring surgery on an injury picked up playing for Bayern Munich. It is very bad news for Senegal and the tournament as a whole, according to former Liverpool teammate Virgil van Dijk.\n\u201cI am very sorry that Sadio misses the match against us because this World Cup simply deserves the best players, Sadio is one of them,\u201d said Van Dijk. \u201cSadio is world class, he is my friend and I will miss him.\u201d \nVan Dijk agrees with his head coach, Louis van Gaal, that the Netherlands should be competing for the trophy in Qatar. \n\u201cFor me, Argentina, Brazil and France are the favourite countries,\u201d he told reporters.\u201cThe Brazilians are always there. The Argentines are strong and the French have a great selection. We have a good group, we have a very experienced trainer, but above all we have team spirit.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n 9.48am  \n\nA bit more of the imminent beer ban at stadiums. It looks like there will be announcement today on the matter. What a farce. Fifa and Budweiser will be having some heated conversations, one imagines. \n\n\n\n\n 9.42am  \n\nTwo handsome young men have written about the eight potential breakthrough stars of this tournament. Naturally, they will all now flop but you can read this and then rub it in the fancies of John and I in a few weeks.\n\n\n\n\n 9.35am  \n\nVinicius Jr is hoping to use football for the greater good. The Real Madrid forward has been impressed by his fellow athletes\u2019 approach to philanthropic causes and is hoping he can use his influence in a similar fashion.\n\u201cI believe I need to do more. I see how athletes like Lewis Hamilton and LeBron James do good and I want to do the same, help people in many ways,\u201d Vinicius said.\u201cEducation is important because not everyone can become a player. Many try, but not all succeed. So I try my best to help the people in Brazil to continue improving and evolving as a person. If they focus with the right guidance, we can get more people going to the university, more doctors, more professors... better professors.\u201d\n\n\n\n 9.31am  \n\nShould we start the day with some Karen Carney backing Brazil to do the business? I think we should.\n\n\n\n\n 9.30am  \nHello\n\nHere we are only two days away from the start of the least anticipated World Cup in history. But do not fear, we have some football to look forward to \u2026 hopefully. \nWe have already found out that a free press is frowned upon and the hospitality looks expensive and underwhelming in Qatar. Not only is the price of beer eye-watering but the Qataris now want to stop it being sold at stadiums and move the vending points to less prominent areas. \nOn the upside, many countries have arrived in the Middle East for their final preparations. Wales have already been forced to move their training sessions to later in the day due to the heat, which is not a promising sign. \nQatar v Ecuador kicks the whole thing off on Sunday and I for one can wait. Prior to that there should be some high jinx, injury news and the prospect that we all find out it is too hot to play in Qatar. \nWe will be bringing you the very latest from our correspondents in Qatar and more besides.\nThere should be no shortage of things going on today, that\u2019s for sure.\n\n"

                    "body": "This week tens of thousands of football fans will arrive in Doha for the 2022 Fifa World Cup. The city that awaits them is one that has been transformed in the 12 years since the small Gulf state won its bid to host one of the biggest sporting events in the world. The stadiums, hotels, apartment blocks and tourist attractions built in preparation for the tournament have reshaped the city\u2019s landscape forever.  They are also the legacy of the sweat and toil of the migrant worker army recruited from some of the poorest countries around the globe who worked long hours in sweltering conditions to build Qatar\u2019s World Cup dream. As the first whistle is set to blow, we have created an alternative tourist guide to the glittering landmarks that will provide the backdrop to the tournament, based on over a decade of reporting on migrant worker rights and the exploitation, debt and squalor that so many World Cup workers told us defined their working lives.   The Corniche Start your day with a brisk walk along the Corniche, the promenade which skirts the bay in the heart of Doha. Count down the last hours until the tournament kicks off by the giant red clock in the shape of the World Cup logo, or take selfies in front of banners and displays with slogans like: \u201cfabulous, connect, amazing, now is all.\u201d Here, you will meet people who have come to enjoy the tournament from all over the world. The only people you will not see are the men from India and Nepal who laboured in the ferocious summer heat to revamp the Corniche in time for your arrival. Most of them were sent home long ago. In July, they told the Guardian they had been forced to pay huge and illegal recruitment fees to agents in their own countries in return for what they believed to be two-year contracts. Yet, in the rush to wrap up construction before the World Cup, many were sent home far earlier, leaving them fearing they would be left jobless, unable to support their families and deep in debt. \u201cEveryone will be sent back because of the World Cup. It doesn\u2019t matter how long you have been here,\u201d said one. \u201cWhat can I do? I\u2019m helpless.\u201d In a statement, a Qatari official said there was no government requirement for companies to repatriate employees or reduce their workforce before the World Cup.  Hotels From the Corniche, head through the glistening towers of West Bay and north to where some of Qatar\u2019s most luxurious hotels look out over the exclusive stretch of coastline. Inside, you will find cavernous marble-lined lobbies and opulent suites. If you\u2019re lucky enough to stay in one, you may find there is even a TV installed in the bathroom, so you can watch the football from the comfort of your bathtub. A single night in a standard room at most of these hotels is more than many of the staff earn in a month. Last year, a Guardian investigation found scores of hotel workers earning a basic wage of \u00a31.25 an hour or less. Some sub-contracted security guards, were working 12-hour shifts without a day off for months. Many staff said they were unable to change jobs because their employer refused to let them leave. \u201cWe\u2019ve fallen into a trap and can\u2019t get out,\u201d said one. In response, Qatari official said the country had a zero-tolerance approach towards violating companies, issuing harsh penalties that included fines and prison sentences. If you\u2019re an England fan, and you want to see where the team hotel is located, it\u2019s on the coast in Al Wakrah. You won\u2019t get in but you can enjoy the souk and nearby beachfront. Stop by the restaurants to enjoy a plate of fresh fish or take a camel ride along the beach. As you do, spare a thought for the security guards patrolling the area. In July, they told the Guardian they endured 12-hour shifts, for 30 days a month. \u201cIf I take a day off, they cut my salary,\u201d said one. They find themselves in a bind. They know they are being exploited, but even the meagre wage they earn here is more than they can make back home, and so they are reluctant to complain. A Kenyan explained that his salary was far lower than he was promised when he left home. \u201cYou are told one thing in Kenya and another in Qatar,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing you can do. Just keep quiet and get on with it.\u201d  National Museum If you want a break from football, drop in to the National Museum. On the outside, it\u2019s made up of mind-bending interlocking discs, designed to look like a desert rose. Some of the men who worked on the inside told the Guardian in 2016 they were earning a much lower salary than they had been promised when they were recruited in Nepal; a basic wage of around \u00a3135 a month. \u201cIf I had known I would [get so little], I definitely wouldn\u2019t have come,\u201d said one. When the Guardian visited their labour camp in a rundown compound outside Doha, it found eight men sharing one room. With no lockers, their clothes were hung on lines across the wall and personal belongings stashed under their bunk beds.  Souq Waqif To end the day, why not head to Souq Waqif? It\u2019s a popular spot for people from around the world who come to shop in its bazaar or have a bite to eat. But when the Guardian visited in 2016, one group of visitors did not appear to be welcome. Whenever the police spotted young south Asian men, they were quickly intercepted and directed to the exit.  That practice has now ended, but low-wage workers in Qatar continue to live in starkly different conditions to what visitors will experience. The Qatari authorities have taken some steps to improve their living and working conditions, including introducing a minimum wage, partially dismantling the abusive kafala system and improving some worker accommodation, but for most of the men you have met on this alternative tour, it is either too little, or too late.  Lusail If you head to the north of Doha you will enter Lusail City, a new district full of outrageous towers, like the crescent-shaped building formed of two giant curved arms reaching skywards. They host two hotels; one has five stars, the other six. There\u2019s another hotel in Lusail that holds a darker secret. It was built in 2014 by North Korean workers under conditions likely to constitute forced labour. They worked so hard and for so long, the site manager built a room for them so they could take a quick rest without having to return to their labour camp. Despite this, it is likely that they only kept about 10% of their earnings, while the rest was expropriated by the North Korean regime. \u201cWe are here to earn foreign currency for our nation,\u201d one said. The site manager said, \u201cThey don\u2019t have a single rial themselves. They borrow money from us if they need small things like cigarettes.\u201d The stadiums  Al Bayt stadium Drive out of Lusail and up the five-lane highway to the stunning Al Bayt stadium, which will host the opening game of the World Cup. If England reach the semi-finals, they are likely to play four games here. The stadium is built to resemble a nomadic tent. If you need refreshments, pop into the on-site McDonalds, also decked out like a tent. Take a walk around the lush grounds that surround the stadium, brush your hand over the immaculate grass of the training pitches and enjoy the cool breeze coming off the small lake. Then consider the men who maintain this welcoming green space. In the summer, the Guardian found them living on the edge of the desert, with up to six men crammed into tiny, windowless cabins.  They said they had been forced to pay illegal fees to secure their jobs and many were still in debt months later, which they were struggling to pay off because their basic salary worked out at just \u00a31 an hour. Despite a new law giving workers the right to freely change jobs, the gardeners at Al Bayt and two other stadiums said they were unable to switch employment. \u201cIf we could change jobs, everyone would leave!\u201d said one. The local World Cup organising committee started a programme in 2017 to reimburse stadium workers who had paid recruitment fees. About \u00a320 million has been repaid so far. The Al Bayt gardeners had not received any repayments at the time the Guardian met them. Following the Guardian\u2019s revelations, the men were moved to better accommodation.  Education City stadium Now head back south to Doha and visit the Education City stadium. It\u2019s been called the \u201cdiamond in the desert\u201d on account of its shiny, angled surface.  The construction of stadiums and other World Cup-related infrastructure has created hundreds of thousands of jobs for workers from some of the poorest countries in the region. Some have positive stories to tell; of earning a decent regular wage, which they sent home to pay for a new house or their children\u2019s education. But for a few, their story has a very different ending. In June 2019, a young Nepali man named Rupchandra Rumba, who worked as a scaffolder at the stadium, woke up gasping for breath in a squalid labour camp nearby. His friends called for help, but it was too late and he died shortly afterwards. Back in Nepal, his wife, Nirmala Pakrin, has spent the last three and a half years wondering why she has never received compensation from his employer. She can\u2019t understand how a country with so much money will not help pay for her son\u2019s education. Al Janoub stadium Keep heading south and you will come to another futuristic arena, resembling a giant white spaceship. It\u2019s called Al Janoub stadium. Eight years ago, labourers preparing the ground for the stadium told the Guardian they were being paid as little as 45p an hour. They said their passports were held by their manager. In 2018, another young Nepali, Tej Narayan Tharu was carrying loads high up in the stadium, when he fell to his death through a gap in the walkway.  In Nepal, his wife, Renuka Chaudhary, was left confused and concerned about the future of their four year-old daughter. \u201cI\u2019m so worried. I have no one to earn money for the family now. How can I pay for her education and raise her?\u201d she said. Sita, Tharu\u2019s mother, said: \u201cI\u2019m heartbroken. My son has gone for ever. He\u2019s never coming back. He has a small daughter. Life is long and hard. How will she survive?\u201d Chaudhary later received compensation for her husband\u2019s death."

                    "body": "\nThe main event\nIf nothing else, you\u2019d imagine idle curiosity will probably get the better of him, but even if it doesn\u2019t he\u2019ll find out soon enough. Whether he elects to go out walking the dog, sits at home watching the ITV4 Midsomer Murders double bill or is cloistered somewhere with his Liverpool teammates sitting with ear buds in and his back to the screen all the better to studiously ignore it, Virgil van Dijk will discover who has won the World Cup at around the same time as the rest of us who have followed it.\nIt was a visibly distraught Van Dijk who, upon being asked if he thought Argentina would win following their bad-tempered quarter-final victory over the Netherlands, tersely told a reporter: \u201cI don\u2019t care, I won\u2019t watch any more.\u201d Having just missed a penalty in the preceding shootout, he was understandably wounded and could be excused his dismissive reply. More than a week later there\u2019s every chance Van Dijk still couldn\u2019t care less how Sunday\u2019s final goes or who wins it, but if that\u2019s genuinely the case he will be surely be in a very small minority of football folk.\nFor more than 12 years and counting it has been impossible not to have a view on Qatar 2022, from the moment, to a mixture of cheers and widespread gasps of astonishment, Sepp Blatter pulled the card bearing the name of the Arabian peninsula country from that infamous envelope back in December 2010. A view on whether it should take place in Qatar, a view on whether it actually would take place in Qatar and then, in more recent years, a view on the incalculable and much-disputed human cost of it taking place in Qatar when it became apparent that Qatar is where it would definitely be held.\n\nBlatter has since acknowledged what many of us already knew in saying that giving Qatar hosting rights was a \u201cmistake\u201d and a \u201cbad choice\u201d, even though his mea culpa centred on the size of the country rather than the human rights abuses perpetrated within its borders. It was indeed \u201ca mistake\u201d and a \u201cbad choice\u201d even if Gianni Infantino, Blatter\u2019s similarly self-serving successor as Fifa president, broke a near-month-long undignified silence to hail this indelible stain on world sporting history as \u201can incredible success on all fronts\u201d.\nFor all Infantino\u2019s nonsense talk, despite the unspeakable grimness surrounding this often tawdry but carefully buffed Fifa spectacle, Qatar 2022 has been an incredible success on one front, insofar as much of the football played has been undeniably sublime. Later on Sunday, the 64th and final match of a soap opera long in the making will be played, the winners crowned and the trophy hoisted triumphantly towards the sky. With so many contrasting narrative arcs and prospective plot-twists it promises to be the hugely compelling sporting spectacle its organisers hoped it would be, even if, like Van Dijk, we might all have good reasons to avoid tuning in. BG\n\nTalking points\nCroatia sign off in styleMislav Orsic\u2019s wonderful goal would have been worthy of winning the World Cup. It was certainly worthy of winning third place for Croatia. The winger\u2019s perfectly flighted curler from an angle, lifted up and over the towering frame of Yassine Bounou, aka Bono, was one of the goals of the tournament. It was the kind of effort you are unlikely to see in a final when the pressure is so much greater, the stakes so much higher. In that sense it was a good advert for the idea of a third-place playoff, and the football was attractive throughout. Morocco may not have got the result they wanted but the match was a chance for their excellent fans to celebrate, and pay tribute to the players for making them proud with their run to the semi-finals. The team\u2019s treatment of the referee was the one sour note, but that aside it was a roaring success. LMc\n\nEnd of one era for La LigaThe retirement of Sergio Busquets from international football marked the last of Spain\u2019s 2010 World Cup-winning squad to take their leave. With Lionel Messi, Luka Modric and Cristiano Ronaldo almost certainly signing off from their last World Cups, Qatar has seen the end of that era when Barcelona and Real Madrid dominated the global scene, from the late noughties onwards. Madrid may be the Champions League holders but Modric, even if his plan is to play on until 2024, is among the last of the old guard. At Barcelona, a club fallen from grace through financial mismanagement, Busquets and Jordi Alba, a survivor from Spain\u2019s Euro 2012 winners, are the last men standing. La Liga\u2019s giants have not been so dominant as in previous tournaments. Argentina have used no players from either club, though Barcelona supplied Jules Kound\u00e9 and Ousmane Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 for France, who also have Aur\u00e9lien Tchouam\u00e9ni and Eduardo Camavinga from Madrid. JB\nBeyond the football\nDavid Beckham has made his first public statement on his controversial involvement with the World Cup host nation, telling a US newspaper through a spokesperson that he \u201chas always believed that sport has the power to be a force for good in the world\u201d. \u201cWe understand that there are different and strongly held views about engagement in the Middle East but see it as positive that debate about the key issues has been stimulated directly by the first World Cup being held in the region,\u201d the statement continued. It added: \u201cWe hope that these conversations will lead to greater understanding and empathy toward all people and that progress will be achieved.\u201d\nThe statement, made to the New York Times, came in response to intense criticism that Beckham, 47, had accepted millions of pounds from Qatar to serve as an ambassador for the games in spite of the country\u2019s repressive stance on LGBTQ+ rights, its human rights record and allegations of mistreatment of migrant workers.\n\nToday\u2019s match\nArgentina v France (Final, 3pm GMT, BBC One and ITV1) Some suggest France have been lucky at this tournament, but the champions\u2019 progress to a second consecutive final has rien to do with good fortune. It is overwhelmingly down to talent, nous, teamwork \u2013 and a liberal helping of hard graft. Whether France successfully blunt Messi\u2019s threat, or Argentina find a formula to negate Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 and co, the team that lift the trophy will have earned it. Perhaps Messi and Mbapp\u00e9 will prosper against defences that have looked vulnerable at times, and we will witness a high-scoring classic? Perhaps a member of the supporting cast, such as Juli\u00e1n \u00c1lvarez or Olivier Giroud, will seize the moment. Messi\u2019s ultimate dream is tantalisingly close, and many neutrals want to see him achieve it. Formidable France, and their fiercely driven coach Didier Deschamps, stand in his way. LMc\nMan in the middle\nPoland will supply the final\u2019s referee in Szymon Marciniak, a 41-year-old from Plock, with his compatriots Pawel Sokolnicki and Tomasz Listkiewicz as his assistants, and Tomasz Kwiatkowski leading the VAR effort. Ismail Elfath, an American, will be fourth official. Marciniak officiated two games four years ago during the group stage in Russia but missed Euro 2020 due to tachycardia. \u201cNow, life gives back to me and I cannot even stop smiling because it\u2019s a great feeling,\u201d said Marciniak, who sports the same World Cup final ref hairstyle as predecessors Pierluigi Collina (2002) and Howard Webb (2010) \u2026 and Gianni Infantino himself. JB\n\nGlobal media-watch\nIn France, on the eve of the final, L\u2019\u00c9quipe drew an appropriate comparison between the great Brazilian Pel\u00e9 and the young megastar Mbapp\u00e9. The newspaper\u2019s front page placed an image of Pel\u00e9 celebrating at the 1970 World Cup, side by side with a similar shot of Mbapp\u00e9 celebrating with teammate Giroud. \u201cTheir story\u201d was the headline. \u201cWith victory tomorrow, Mbapp\u00e9\u2019s France would join Brazil, the last country to win two consecutive World Cups,\u201d read the sub-heading. \u201cMbapp\u00e9 would be the first player since Pel\u00e9 to be doubly crowned.\u201d Meanwhile, here\u2019s Sunday\u2019s front page. LMc\n\nThe internet reacts\nWho says romance is dead? A pair of Morocco fans turned up for the playoff as boyfriend and girlfriend \u2026 but left with a wedding to plan for.\n\n\nAnd finally \u2026\nThat concludes the Qatar 2022 briefing, but a joy of this World Cup\u2019s timing means it\u2019s just three and a half years until the next men\u2019s finals. The United States, Mexico and Canada will be the trio of hosts for a vast, sprawling 48-team tournament for which the format has yet to be determined. Something almost certain is that Gianni Infantino, whose Fifa presidential reign will extend to a third term as he was an unopposed candidate, will declare the North American World Cup as the \u201cbest ever\u201d. He said that for Russia 2018 and it\u2019s been his mantra for the buildup and throughout this tournament. Making $7.5bn of revenue, $1bn more than projected, accounts for some of that high praise. The next four years will see Fifa expected to take in $10bn of revenue from 2026 sponsors, TV rights and tickets.\n\nOf course, before all that, there\u2019s the 2023 Women\u2019s World Cup in Australia and New Zealand starting in July, another winter tournament. There, hopefully the actual football will do more of the talking. JB"

                    "body": "Look who we are, we are the dreamers. We make it happen. There is something seductively inane about the soundtrack to Qatar 2022, present in the slogans plastered across its surfaces, the sonic assault of the World Cup PA, the playlist of official anthems, centralised messages, approved corporate machine-feelings.\n\u201cBelieving is magic\u201d read the words across the back of the T-shirts worn by a column of men filing through the service exit of the vast fibreglass tent that is Al Bayt Stadium in the wee hours of Friday morning. The power of dreams. The power of football. The power of Football Dreams. What could ever be wrong with that?\nAcross a 12-year process that has generated so many inane slogans \u2013 so much love, so much tolerance \u2013 Football Dreams is probably the grand-daddy of them all. This was the name given to the outreach element of Qatar\u2019s Aspire Academy during the early days of the baroque procurement process for this World Cup.\n\nFootball Dreams has been slightly lost in the years since, obscured by more immediate issues. But it is worth revisiting now, viewing with the facts laid over one another like an architect\u2019s carbon drawings. A cold case, it makes for remarkable reading with what we know now. There are no smoking guns when it comes to why and how at Qatar 2022, just an endless plume of unexplained smoke. But here is a little more.\nWith hindsight Football Dreams was always a strange concept. At vast expense (is there another kind?) Qatar sent a team of elite football scouts on a series of people-hunting trips to 15 developing nations, touring villages in their column of SUVs, harvesting children for a Willy Wonka-style golden scholarship to the Aspire school and academy.\nBetween 2007 and 2014 Qatar screened more than 3.5 million 12- and 13-year-old boys. At its height Football Dreams had six thousand staff and volunteers. Out of this mass of hopeful humanity up to 20 Aspire scholarships were awarded each year, pathway to becoming a Champion In Sport or A Champion In Life (we are, and Qatar can\u2019t emphasise this enough, The Dreamers).\n\nThe point of this process was never really clear beyond the messaging. Qatar called it \u201ca humanitarian project\u201d. Pel\u00e9 lurked vaguely at the fringes. Towards the end there was some charitable work involving mosquito nets and a video that showed Lionel Messi looking worried about malaria. Some human rights bodies likened Football Dreams to people trafficking. Even Sepp Blatter called it \u201can exploitation\u201d before abruptly changing his mind.\nLooking back it seems like a strange and unworkable concept. From a blur of practice games in nations such as Guatemala and Vietnam Qatar planned to unearth star talent. Actual established professional academies spend years trying and failing to do this with endless monitoring and space to bloom late or fall away. Children are vulnerable beings. Sport is unforgiving. This thing, the footballing equivalent of game-hunting from your open helicopter bay door, was never going to work in any serious fashion.\nThe Dreams programme ran from 2007, plateaued after the winning bid and was shut down in 2014. But Aspire, its launchpad, remains key to Qatar\u2019s sporting ambition.\nThe Aspire dome is a beautiful soft blue glass curve rising up out of Doha\u2019s eastern suburbs like an igloo of the gods. Speakers pipe the sounds of birdsong across the wider Aspire Zone, which houses a full-size football pitch, accommodation, a school, an Olympic-scale swimming pool, sports science centres.\nChasing it down on foot past the vast craning Khalifa Stadium, following the line of the Italianate-themed shopping mall with indoor gondola lake, there is a familiar feeling of fruitless pursuit. That blue glass horizon peeps out through the gaps in the buildings like the sea over the crest of a hill, never really getting closer.\nIn the shadow of the Doha Torch, the dome finally reveals itself, the egg that hatched the World Cup. Witness Excitement reads a vast beige sign at the edge of the Zone. Except, there is no excitement here. On the morning after the Qatar national team\u2019s World Cup ended in limp defeat to the Netherlands, the Aspire Zone is shuttered. For now any visible sign of Qatari Aspiration is on hold.\n\nIt should be said Aspire has been a great success on its own terms. The programme to create a Qatar national team was initially under the care of Sheikh Jassim bin Hamad al-Thani, a genuine football fanatic rumoured, as John McManus writes in his wonderful book Inside Qatar, to have suffered insomnia from watching so much football on the banks of screens in his bed chamber.\nQatar does not have an ingrained outdoor sporting culture. Even its winter heat is draining, creeping under your skin like a dose of flu. So Qatar built a kinder blue sky under its dome. Every kid with any kind of talent was enrolled and ranked and rated, the emphasis always on detecting elite potential.\nIt is an extreme version of the systems rolled out by the British Olympic programmes or Premier League academies. Sport for the few. Sport as entirely outcome-based, sport as an elite level gloss on a sedentary society.\n\nBut it worked. Aspire graduates (this is misleading: every player here is an Aspire graduate. Where else are you going to train?) won age-group competitions and then the Asian Cup in 2019, sparking mass celebrations on the Corniche.\nThis process hit its outer limit in the last two weeks. Hundreds of millions of pounds in the making, every detail refined and finessed, Qatar\u2019s footballers were the most feeble World Cup hosts in men\u2019s tournament history. They had six shots on target. The players looked stunned by the glare. At times there was almost a sense of opponents going easy on them.\nIn a way it was apt. The Qatar team is essentially a construct, a slogan made flesh, an expert replica of a live sporting culture. It embodies brilliantly the question that hangs over so much at this World Cup. Is this actually real? Qatar wants a World Cup. Qatar wants a turn at the show. Today I feel like \u2026 a professional footballer.\nBut one thing is also clear. Qatar always has a plan. We are the dreamers. But we also make things happen. And this is where Football Dreams re-enters the Aspire picture. The dots have not really been joined. Let us join them here. This is no doubt unfortunate coincidence, yet another case of Qatar unfairly tainted by other people\u2019s corruption. But here are some facts. Of the 15 countries awarded the Football Dreams mission, five were also the home nations of a Fifa executive committee (exco) member. Fifa exco members decide who gets to host a World Cup.\nSome were a baffling fit for the programme. This issue floated up at the time and did not really go anywhere. It is mentioned in the Garcia report into Fifa corruption but was then largely lost in the fug. What Garcia did not know, as his report predated the key arrests and bans, is that all five of those Fifa exco members, the Football Dreams converts, have turned out to be demonstrably tainted by corruption. This fact has never really been adequately reverse-engineered into the Football Dreams puzzle. Exhuming its details now, this is what it looks like.\nWorawi Makudi was a member of the Fifa exco. Qatar\u2019s Football dreams programme came to his home nation Thailand. He voted in the Qatar World Cup bid. He was banned and fined in 2016 for forgery and falsification but the ban was overturned by Cas after the Thai\u2019s criminal conviction was quashed.\n\nRafael Salguero was a member of the Fifa exco. Qatar\u2019s football dreams programme came to his home nation Guatemala. He voted on the Qatar World Cup bid. He pleaded guilty in October 2016 to criminal conspiracy to commit bank fraud and launder money.\nAmos Adamu was a member of the Fifa exco. Qatar\u2019s Football Dream project came to his home nation Nigeria. Adamu did not even get to the start line in Zurich. He was suspended from the vote after apparently agreeing to take a bribe in a newspaper sting.\nIssa Hayatou was a member of the Fifa exco. Qatar\u2019s Football Dreams project came to his home nation Cameroon. He voted on the Qatar World Cup bid. Hayatou has been accused of, and firmly denied, allegations of corruption relating to the activities of Mohammed bin Hammam at Fifa.\nMost startling of all, Fifa exco member Nicol\u00e1s Leoz of Paraguay, who was instrumental in shepherding the South American bloc to vote for Qatar, has since been accused of taking bribes and assorted other nefarious practices, blame-loaded into the grave by his former colleagues. A Qatar Football Dreams project opened in Leoz\u2019s home country shortly before the vote.\nAt the end of which we have a \u00a3100m programme that made little practical sense installing itself in a series of locations where football administration is governed by people who are with hindsight tainted by corruption; all of whom have a say on the success of Qatar\u2019s 2022 World Cup vote.\nThere is no evidence that any of this is connected, or any undisputed evidence of unsound influence around votes cast for Qatar\u2019s bid. But Garcia was already concerned about Aspire. The report states: \u201cThere is evidence that Qatar 2022 employed an entity that at least contemplated diverting Aspire resources to countries associated with Executive Committee members or otherwise using Aspire resources to influence those members.\u201d\n\nAs Garcia notes, Football Dreams was run in its early stages by Sandro Rosell, who would later wire \u00a32m to an account held by the 10-year\u2011old daughter of Ricardo Teixeira, a discredited Fifa exco member; payment that was, the relevant parties have insisted, \u201cunrelated to Qatar\u2019s World Cup bid\u201d.\nGarcia circles around a meeting in January 2010 at Itanhang\u00e1 Golf club in Rio attended by the emir of Qatar plus Julio Grondona, Leoz, Teixeira and Jo\u00e3o Havelange, plus Aspire officials. The meeting was described by Qatar as \u201can opportunity for the charismatic and progressive Emir to meet the leaders of South American football\u201d. Garcia accepts, as Qatar contends in its defence, that \u201cthe Emir is not bound by Fifa\u2019s rules\u201d. Which sounds, on the evidence of this World Cup, about right.\n\nThe Guardian tried to talk to Qatar\u2019s Supreme Committee for Delivery &amp; Legacy about Aspire, about these issues, about the successes and future direction of the programme, but nobody was able to reply to requests. Qatar has already had its say in response to Garcia. \u201cIn the upside down world where the Qatar Bid committee finds itself, the Aspire programme is now described by some media as using its influence in countries with Executive Committee members in order to improperly influence the outcome of the bid. This allegation is disproven by a neutral version of its history.\u201d\nWhat to make of all this now, as Qatar 2022 gallops on through its winter fever dream? As ever with Qatar it is useful to apply the filter of furiously literal-minded Qatari realpolitik. How do you get your hands on a World Cup? You give the world what it wants. OK. Let\u2019s do that times a million, do it better than anyone else, do it better and more lavishly than, say, Australia, who also made entreaties towards Africa, or England, who seemed to think handbags would do the job. Lads, this is how you do it.\nQatar is like your no-filter friend who sees this stuff, the transactionalism, the commodification of human lives, the sharp edges of global capitalism, and strides straight through to its endpoint, without the elements in other cultures that soften or obscure this process. Want a World Cup? Here is a literal desert astro-turfing project, because this is how it works.\nThe Aspire dome sits at the centre of this thing, crouched behind its opaque reflective walls. The fields of its public zone are also empty. A massive frozen football screen displays a heap of broken images to no one. Wandering about this place there is a sense of the loneliness of the enterprise, the sheer force of will required to create this imagined world. Aspire will re-gear itself, will set its sights on securing the much-coveted Olympic Games. For now the deep green pitch beneath the mirrored dome is empty, the lights blazing down, a lone guard patrolling the centre, a place, still, of Football Dreams."

                    "body": "With the surrounding noise on human rights, worker deaths, image laundering and the rest, it is easy to forget what Qatar 2022 is really all about, the founding message at the very heart of this global festival of football. Which is, of course, corruption. Committee members living high on someone else\u2019s hog. Development money that never developed. The fat, wet handshake wrapped up in a TV rights deal. It is time, six weeks away from Fifa\u2019s winter World Cup, to consider the base note of this thing. An important disclaimer is required at this point. There is no chain of evidence linking Qatar itself to any kind of corruption in securing its World Cup bid success. Qatar\u2019s supreme delivery committee has always strongly denied any such involvement. And rightly so. A two-year inquiry by Fifa\u2019s ethics committee found no significant concerns. In fact both Qatar and Russia could reasonably claim to have been unfortunate, assailed on all sides by other people\u2019s corruption, and forced to operate within this nexus of bad optics and sour grapes. Even if, by happy coincidence, the decisions made within that environment have also happened to align with both their interests. Either way Qatar 2022 remains an event tainted at its outset by a great gushing spume of individual corruption among Fifa\u2019s executive committee and decisive actors outside the voting room; almost all of whom were physically present at the moment of delivery on 2 December 2010 in the Messe hall at Fifa House, Zurich, arguably the single most significant day in the history of modern football, and an occasion future historians will surely mine for colour detail while fleshing out their study of the carbon wars of the early 21st century.  There is still a sense of double\u2011take about that extraordinary tableau, with its cast of rainmakers, nabobs and grifters. Fifa\u2019s head office is strangely unrepentant in its aesthetic. What kind of organisation actively chooses matt black walls and tinted glass, a bug-proof basement boardroom, the unshakable sense of being, above all a lair? On Bid Decision Day the whole building was gripped with a sense of event glamour, buzzing with rumour and counter-rumour, talk of votes cast and promises made. The announcement deadline slipped glamorously. Eventually the world\u2019s media found themselves gathered in a zombie-horde crush, vetted and ticketed, ready to swarm into the remaining seats in the glamour\u2011studded auditorium. From the start, stuff was happening in there. The first shiver of English unease came with the sight of David Beckham up near the front shrugging and looking sad. Ironically so, some might say, given Beckham\u2019s own subsequent deep personal interest in the success of Gulf-region football: his Saudi tie-in, his one-man relaunch as a multimillion-dollar ambassador for Qatar itself (every man has his price. Beckham is at least pretty specific about his). There was the extraordinary sight of Sepp Blatter on stage, a gleaming golden super-smooth statuette of a man, pawing and stroking and fondling the trophy itself, seeming to know even in that moment that this was also a kind of goodbye.  And around the room it was a case of here-comes-everyone. Here is Bill Clinton looking politely baffled. Here is Roman Abramovich, not the kind of person to enter an envelope-opening competition when there\u2019s a chance the contents might come as a surprise. Here are Morgan Freeman, Seb Coe and Elle Macpherson. Here is Chuck Blazer, the mobility scooter Pimpernel. Post-announcement, Boris Johnson could be seen mooching about muttering sadly about deals behind the deals. Most striking was the appearance of Vladimir Putin, strolling out all alone into the centre of the stage, there to preen and shrug and drawl his answers to the gathered sports press. Putin had previously said he would not attend \u201cso that they can make a decision without any pressure from the outside\u201d, presumably an example of his famously sly sense of humour. What actually happened here? The basic outline is startling enough. In the years since, 16 of 22 voting exco members present in that hall have been implicated in or investigated over some form of alleged corruption or bad practice. The most significant event was the 2015 arrests in Switzerland and subsequent investigation. The FBI produced a 47-count indictment against assorted footballing figures. Julio Grondona, 26 years a Fifa executive, died in 2014 and has been safely loaded with blame by his old pals. Jack Warner, 79 years old and still going about his business in Trinidad, remains the key suspect for the US Department of Justice. Brazilian investigators ran Ricardo Teixeira to ground, but never found the string to unravel the rest of it. The Garcia report provided eye-popping detail, not least around the English bid team and its dealings with Warner. Other developments have arrived outside of this, through leaks, media digging and opaque Fifa investigations. With a lot of this there is a sense of clearing house, Fifa using the misdeeds of the past to weed its own executive. At times it feels like piecing together the world\u2019s most corrupt jigsaw puzzle, but always missing the central segment.  And in the end it is hard not to come back to that room. Ultimately the chief players behind this double World Cup bid spectacular were Blatter, Michel Platini, Vitali Mutko, Russia\u2019s bid supremo, Mohammed bin Hammam, the Qatari president of the Asian Football Confederation, Nicolas Sarkozy, the president of France, and Putin. Fast forward to the current timeline and Blatter, Platini and Bin Hammam have been banned from football. Sarkozy has a criminal conviction for dubious election practice. Mutko has been implicated in a state-sponsored doping scandal. Putin is waging a land war in Europe. And yet none of this has ever really touched Qatar, which remains essentially blameless, a spectator to the arraignment of others. There have been some spectacular accusations towards connected persons. In 2011 the Sunday Times printed a story alleging that Bin Hammam had made payments to football power brokers totalling $5m via 10 slush funds. Bin Hammam, it was said, hosted backslapping junkets where cash was handed out. He allegedly paid $1.6m into a bank account controlled by Warner, half of it before the vote for the World Cup. He allegedly paid the Somali Football Federation $100,000 through his daughter\u2019s bank account. And why not though, eh? Bin Hammam has been banned for life from football, then unbanned, then rebanned. He\u2019s seen as a hero in Doha. He\u2019s 73 years old. He\u2019s not talking to anyone any time soon. In 2019 there were allegations Fifa had benefited from a $400m rights deal with Al Jazeera, Qatar\u2019s state TV station, offered just 21 days before the bid decision, with an extra $100m top-up should Qatar succeed. Fifa denies this was material to any decision made. The Garcia report revealed that Sandro Rosell, who had connected dealings with Qatar, had made a payment of \u20ac1.45m to the bank account of Teixeira\u2019s then 10-year\u2011old daughter. Rosell had previously sent an email to his Qatari contact promising: \u201cThis means I\u2019ll be able to invest this money for my interest, that I hope, finally, will be yours.\u201d What does that mean? Does it mean anything? There was mention of lucrative friendly fixtures, of Qatari gas deals, of projects funded, of Michel D\u2019Hooghe, Belgian exco member, being \u201ccompromised\u201d by the offer of a job for his son at Qatar\u2019s Aspire Academy.  Plus there is the other major set piece of that bid period, the lunch at the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace in November 2010 when Sarkozy, France\u2019s president, hosted Platini and the emir of Qatar. Platini switched his vote to Qatar around this time. He denies the two events were connected. The emir\u2019s government would later buy out Paris Saint-Germain, increase its stake in a French media group and buy up the rights to French football. France has enjoyed productive commercial relations with Qatar ever since. Everybody present denies there is any connection. At the end of which there is a feeling that all we really have is the echo of something, the froth at the fringes. For all the trauma, the cost, the heat in that room in Zurich, the cutting loose of a generation of leathery old grandees has failed to derail the machine at its centre. Gianni Infantino was being investigated by the Swiss authorities over possible criminal misconduct, although this process seems to have stalled and gone cold. He lives in Qatar now, closer to the real business at hand. For the Game, For The World, as the governing body\u2019s own motto states. Fifa will end up with the usual $3bn World Cup profit. Qatar will get to stage its spectacular, to present a face to the global cameras. As ever, it is only the players that change."

                    "body": "Thousands of poorly paid migrant workers in Qatar are being forced to return home before the World Cup, leaving many fearing they will be left jobless, unable to support their families and deep in debt. In some cases, workers say they have been sent back before the end of their contracts or without receiving their full salary or allowances. The moves to send migrant workers back to their home countries before the beginning of the Fifa tournament appears to be linked to a government circular, published last year and seen by the Guardian, which ordered some contractors to complete all works by mid-September and prepare a plan for workers\u2019 leave that \u201cmaximises the reduction in the number of workers in the country\u201d in the run-up to the World Cup. On the sweeping promenade that skirts the bay in Doha, a red clock in the shape of Qatar\u2019s World Cup logo counts down the days until the tournament begins. When the Guardian visited in the summer, hundreds of migrant workers dressed in blue overalls were working in the stifling humidity to complete a revamp of a popular walkway and the road alongside it, known as the Corniche, which is expected to be a destination for thousands of tourists and football fans once the tournament begins. The Guardian interviewed 25 labourers employed on the Corniche. Most said they had expected to be in Qatar for two years but were being sent home far sooner \u2013 in some cases after just 10 months. Many of those interviewed have now returned to their own countries. Some workers who spoke to the Guardian said they had not been working long enough to repay the huge sums \u2013 equivalent to four or five months\u2019 basic salary in Qatar \u2013 that they borrowed to pay recruitment agents in their home countries to secure their jobs in Qatar.  \u201cWe don\u2019t want to go back. We\u2019re poor so we need to work,\u201d said a Nepali worker, who said he had been forced to pay the equivalent of almost \u00a31,000 in illegal recruitment fees to secure the job. \u201cI have not yet paid back the fees. I will be in loss if I\u2019m sent back.\u201d Others were in a state of confusion, saying they were being sent home but had been told they may be recalled after the World Cup. They are now facing up to six months with no salary while they wait to see if they will be able to return. All the workers interviewed said they had no choice but to leave. \u201cMany have already been sent and others are on the list. If your name is on the list, you have to go,\u201d said one. Many blamed the World Cup for the sudden end to their work. \u201cEveryone will be sent back because of the World Cup. It doesn\u2019t matter how long you have been here,\u201d said one. \u201cWhat can I do? I\u2019m helpless.\u201d Ansar Ali* said he paid an agent in India 100,000 rupees (\u00a31,050) to secure his job. To afford the fee, he borrowed money at a steep 10% interest rate, but calculated that over two years he could repay the debt and still earn enough to support his wife and two sons. But only 10 months after arriving in Qatar, he was now expecting to be sent home at any moment. \u201cI don\u2019t know when I\u2019ll be sent, but I know I\u2019ll have to go. Two or three of my friends have already been notified,\u201d he said. \u201cHow will I survive when I go back? How will I pay back my debt?\u201d he asked as he walked to a currency exchange to swap Qatari riyals for Indian rupees. The workers interviewed by the Guardian are employed by UrbaCon Trading &amp; Contracting Company (UCC) and InfraRoad, both subsidiaries of UCC Holding, on a project to upgrade the Corniche. Most of the affected workers appear to have been hired on short-term \u201cproject visas\u201d, but say they were told they would be employed for at least two years. Letters from InfraRoad offering workers jobs in August 2021 \u2013 after the government circular was published \u2013 appear to back this up. The letters promise annual leave and a return air ticket after two years, and require a two-month notice period after two or more years of service.  Some workers blamed recruitment agents in their home countries for falsely promising them a two-year contract. Others said the responsibility lay with the contractor. \u201cIt\u2019s the company\u2019s fault because they made the agreement with the agent,\u201d says one. Research by migrant-rights.org, an organisation that advocates for the rights of migrant workers in the Gulf, uncovered similar cases among workers recently sent back to Nepal by a number of Qatar\u2019s biggest construction companies. Some workers told migrant-rights.org that they had not received their full salaries, overtime pay or end-of-service benefits. Others said they had been sent home before the end of their contracts. One, who had worked in Qatar for 12 years, including on a number of World Cup stadiums, said: \u201cHow nice it would be for the workers like me to watch the games at the stadiums we ourselves made. But who cares about us? There\u2019s no value for labourers in that country. I feel like the World Cup is an event of and for only rich people.\u201d May Romanos, Gulf researcher at Amnesty International, said: \u201cIt is crucial for the Qatari government to put workers\u2019 rights at the forefront of any decisions and ensure that the very people who made Qatar\u2019s dream to host this World Cup possible do not face further abuses and violations as a result.\u201d In a statement, a Qatari official said there was no government requirement for companies to repatriate employees or reduce their workforce before the World Cup. \u201cAny independent measures by companies to reduce their workforce must be taken in accordance with the law and must not adversely impact the wellbeing of employees,\u201d it said. The statement also said employment law allowed employers and employees to terminate a contract before the end of its term as long as they adhered to the legal notice period. Foreign workers have the right to change jobs if their contract is terminated and legal procedures are in place if an employee does not receive their wages or allowances at the end of their contract, it said. The Qatari government also said a fund to support workers, including by reimbursing unpaid wages or benefits, had paid out \u00a3152.5m by last month. \u201cQatar is committed to a fair and effective labour system, and we value the indispensable role of foreign workers in our economy and wider society,\u201d the official added.

                    "body": "More than 1,300 \u201cviolent and abusive\u201d football fans in England and Wales will be banned from travelling to the World Cup in Qatar next month following a season disfigured by a dramatic surge in disorder at matches. Measures will come into force this Friday requiring 1,308 people with a history of football-related violence or disorder to surrender their passports, preventing them travelling to the Gulf state or neighbouring countries from where they could commute to games. Fans banned from football in England and Wales, along with any supporter who has \u201cpreviously caused trouble and is deemed likely to do so again\u201d will be prevented from travelling to the region from 10 days before the World Cup starts on 20 November until the tournament\u2019s conclusion a week before Christmas. \u201cWe will not let the behaviour of a minority of lawbreakers tarnish what will be an exciting tournament,\u201d said the home secretary, Suella Braverman. The crackdown follows a sharp rise in disorder and pitch invasions, with football-related arrests rising by nearly 60% last season compared with the last full year before the pandemic. Recent Home Office data reveals that incidents were reported at 1,609 of the 3,019 matches played over the course of last season \u2013 more than half of all fixtures. Yet the number of individuals banned from heading to Qatar is only slightly higher than the 1,200 Britons banned from travelling to Russia for the World Cup four years ago. That is despite Wales joining England to play at next month\u2019s tournament, though the Home Office did not provide a country-by-country breakdown of fans who will have their passports seized. For the 2014 tournament in Brazil about 2,200 England supporters received football banning orders, and around 3,200 individuals were banned from travelling to South Africa for the 2010 World Cup.  In a statement, the Home Office said it had responded to the recent disorder with a number of measures and warned that any banned supporter attempting to reach Qatar could face six months in prison and an unlimited fine. Those facing bans can seek permission to travel to other countries away from the Gulf while the World Cup is being staged, but even that will be far from straightforward as they will be subject to thorough checks. Police will also be able to stop previous offenders judged likely to cause trouble from travelling to the Gulf. As part of a targeted operation at ports, if such people are caught attempting to reach Qatar, they will face a court hearing for a football banning order within 24 hours. The Home Office added that police in Qatar would also be gathering intelligence, warning that fans considered to be \u201cposing a risk\u201d could get a football banning order on their return to the UK as well as being arrested for offences in Qatar. \u201cAs with all events of this nature, we are working closely with the host authorities on the safety of British nationals attending and on delivering a successful and enjoyable event,\u201d Braverman said. She added: \u201cViolence, abuse and disorder is not tolerated here, and this criminal behaviour will not be tolerated at the World Cup, which is why we are taking this firm approach.\u201d Sources are confident that most fans will comply with the banning orders; 99% of supporters who received one surrendered their passport before the 2018 tournament. Statistics published last month revealed that 516 new football banning orders were issued during last season after a total of 2,198 arrests. Among the new measures to tackle violence at football matches is a power to extend football banning orders to cover online hate crime linked to the game. The Home Office\u2019s statement that \u201cabusive\u201d fans will be among those prevented from travelling to Qatar suggests a number may have committed such offences. Ministers have also extended football banning orders to cover class A drugs offences at matches following reports of widespread cocaine use at games."

                    "body": "Qatari authorities have failed to give a guarantee to travelling LGBTQ+ supporters that they will be safe at the World Cup, prompting leading organisations to advocate against travel to the tournament.\nThe Guardian this week presented the Supreme Committee, the body in charge of organising the World Cup, with a series of direct questions related to LGBTQ+ fans and their concerns, but received no specific answers.\nThe questions included whether:\n\nLGBTQ+ people would be protected by Qatari authorities if threatened because of their sexuality.\nArticles of the Qatari penal code, including those which outlaw \u201cleading, instigating or seducing a male in any way to commit sodomy\u201d, would be suspended during the tournament.\nFans carrying rainbow flags would be allowed to take them into stadiums.\nThe Supreme Committee would specifically welcome LGBTQ+ people as World Cup visitors.\n\nA general reply said: \u201cEveryone will be welcome to Qatar in 2022, regardless of their race, background, religion, gender, sexual orientation or nationality. We are a relatively conservative society \u2013 for example, public displays of affection are not a part of our culture. We believe in mutual respect and so whilst everyone is welcome, what we expect in return is for everyone to respect our culture and traditions.\u201d\nThe Guardian approached a representative of Qatar\u2019s government communications office with the first two of those questions and received no response.\nFears over safety have been rising among LGBTQ+ supporter groups as dialogue with organisers has stalled. Anne Lieberman, a founding member of the LGBTIQ Human Rights Sports Coalition, said the group had been in discussion with Qatari authorities for nearly two years but had yet to receive categorical safety assurances.\n\u201cThis quite clearly suggests to us that LGBTIQ people, whatever their role, will not be protected from the state and its repressive anti-LGBTIQ legislation, or from other potential risks to their safety,\u201d Lieberman said.\nAn unwillingness on the part of Qatari authorities to address concerns directly, or even to mention the term LGBTQ+, has led to a situation where groups are effectively recommending a boycott of the tournament.\nLou Englefield of the organisation Football v Homophobia said: \u201cI know of no European LGBTIQ supporters\u2019 group, or individual supporters, who are currently planning to attend this World Cup. The position of the Supreme Committee is just not in keeping with the undertakings they must have given to Fifa. How can an international sporting event which expects millions of visitors not be open to reassuring a large minority group who have well-founded fears that they will be safe and welcome? We have never seen anything like this.\u201d\nFifa told the Guardian it believed it had received sufficient assurances from Qatari authorities regarding fan safety and the application of the law, although no specific details were shared.\nIn a letter to the Human Rights Sports Coalition seen by the Guardian, Fifa\u2019s Joyce Cook, then the chief social responsibility and education officer and now a senior adviser, said the governing body had \u201cthoroughly assessed the named legal clauses and their implementation in practice, including in particular as they pertain to LGBTIQ+ persons\u201d.\n\nShe wrote: \u201cBased on our engagement with the relevant Qatari authorities, and following existing government guarantees, and the event-specific legislation, as well as our experience of hosting other events in Qatar, Fifa is confident that persons identifying as LGBTIQ+ will not face any repercussions based on the above mentioned legal provisions.\u201d\nLGBTQ+ organisations say a lack of specifics and public communication has reinforced concerns. Even the issue of whether fans will be able to fly rainbow flags in Doha without repercussions remains unresolved.\nAccording to Lieberman: \u201cFifa has had a responsibility from the beginning to ensure the proper human rights due diligence was done, and a positive legacy for all is left, and now we are less than 150 days out still fighting for basic safety assurances.\u201d\nLast Thursday Fifa published figures showing 1.8m tickets have been sold for the World Cup, which begins on 21 November. It is an increase of a million on the previous total and remaining tickets will be available on a first come, first served basis from Tuesday. \u201cFans interested in an unforgettable trip of a lifetime to Qatar are being urged to act swiftly before the coveted seats are snapped up,\u201d Fifa said."

                    "body": "When the Wales men\u2019s team line up this evening for what will be a stirring rendition of Hen Wlad fy Nhadau at their World Cup opener, each player will know that he carries the hopes and dreams of a footballing nation. But more than that, he will know he has already helped make dreams come true.\nEnding a 64-year wait for World Cup qualification makes this a Welsh team of history makers. Yes, the march to the semi-finals of Euro 2016 still looms large in the memory of all Wales fans, but it is respect and gratitude, rather than a huge sense of expectation, that I and many other fans will be feeling tonight.\nWales fans know all about footballing dreams \u2013 and nightmares. As a child, I felt the disappointment of the team missing out on Espa\u00f1a \u201982, mercifully unaware of how often the feeling would return. Nevertheless, by then I was obsessed with the World Cup, compiling scrapbooks about the players in each team and facts about the countries involved.\nI already had some sense that this was bigger than football alone. Looking back, the tournament was a rare break from the often parochial concerns of eighties television and struck a chord with a young football-mad boy with family on three continents. Now, finally, I have the chance to indulge my passion for the World Cup and Welsh football at the same time. I\u2019ll be among hundreds at the London Welsh Centre watching Wales (population 3.1 million) take on the US (population 331 million).\n\nStill, I have mixed feelings about this tournament, as will a lot of people. Many have raised concerns for LGBTQ+ fans wishing to travel to Qatar for the tournament, given the country\u2019s draconian laws banning homosexuality and the recent homophobic comments from a Qatari ambassador for the World Cup. I\u2019ve seen far less written about the safety of gay players, however; perhaps this betrays the broader homophobia within the men\u2019s game, which is still far from an environment where players can safely be out. Many of the 22 Fifa executive committee members who awarded consecutive World Cups to Russia and Qatar have since been fined, suspended, banned or indicted. The Guardian has reported that there have been 6,500 migrant worker deaths in Qatar since that decision. The world governing body grows ever further out of touch with fans and players.\nPolitics is not new to the World Cup. Wales\u2019s 1958 qualification came about only because Egypt and and several other countries had either withdrawn or refused to play Israel, citing the latter\u2019s invasion of Egypt in 1956. Wales had no such qualms \u2013 perhaps because the UK had been part of the invasion.\n\nLike the current squad, the one in 1958 was managed by a man from the valleys with a global superstar as its talisman. But the tournament was a very different affair, with half as many teams competing and minimal media coverage back home. On returning home to Swansea, defender Mel Charles was asked if he\u2019d been away on his holidays.\nIn contrast, 2022 qualification is shaping up to be a cultural moment for Wales. The camaraderie among the players and the close bond to the Red Wall, as the fans on the stands are known, has been building for well over a decade now, helped no doubt by an unprecedented period of success on the pitch, but also by the Football Association of Wales, which often feels like an extension of the fanbase. Frequent references to Cymru indicate a newfound pride taken in Cymraeg. Bucket hats, vintage shirts, Zombie Nation, Yma O Hyd; Welsh football fandom these days comes with its own look and its own sound.\nIndeed, the FAW video that accompanies Dafydd Iwan\u2019s remastered protest song, drives home just how much Wales has changed in those intervening 64 years. Among the football clips are scenes of the 1965 flooding of Capel Celyn, the 1966 Aberfan disaster, the miners\u2019 strike of 1984-5, the 1997 devolution referendum and the Cymdeithas yr Iaith protests that led to Welsh finally being recognised as an official language in 2011.\n\nIf the events included in the video offer little to acknowledge the long presence of Black people and racial minorities in Wales, the same cannot be said of G\u0175yl Cymru, a 10-day festival that aims to strengthen the links between sports and the arts and build a cultural legacy for the World Cup. Organised by the FAW in partnership with Arts Council Wales, G\u0175yl Cymru was launched with a short film featuring Hanan Issa, the new national poet Wales, performing The Crowd Gathers, alongside Grug Muse, who translated the poem into Welsh. Issa, the first Muslim to be made national poet, writes in English and uses Welsh and Arabic phrases in the poem.\nFestival highlights include rappers Lemfreck and Mace the Great, performing in New York before the Cymru v USA game, comedians Priya Hall and Leila Navabi and new artwork from Yusuf Ismail and Shawqi Hasson of Unify, whose murals are already modern landmarks in Cardiff. There will also be events featuring the Rainbow Wall, FAW\u2019s group for LGBTQ+ supporters and allies.\nFifa should take note. It could learn much from the FAW about what the modern game could look like.\n\nDarren Chetty is a writer, teacher and researcher. He is co-editor of Welsh (Plural): Essays on the Future of Wales\n"

Not this time: the 2022 tournament has been mired in controversy since it was awarded to Qatar 12 years ago. The small but ultra-wealthy Middle Eastern state thought that hosting the world\u2019s most-watched sporting event would showcase it as a major player on the global stage. But instead Qatar has come in for severe criticism on a number of fronts, in particular for its treatment of migrant workers, anti LGBTQ+ laws, and restrictions on freedom of speech. \u201cA deflated football in the desert seemed like a perfect metaphor to capture the controversy,\u201d says illustrator Barry Downard of his cover artwork for this week\u2019s Guardian Weekly magazine. In a special report, Patrick Wintour asks whether Qatar has lost at geopolitical football before the action has even begun. The cartoonist David Squires brilliantly brings to life the plight of a migrant worker turned whistleblower and, in the final reckoning, sports writer Jonathan Liew tries to salvage some actual football from the diplomatic wreckage. On that theme, further back in the features section there\u2019s a reminder of what the game should be about as we meet some of the young people who will be cheering on their teams from afar. Another dubious global milestone was reached this week as the world\u2019s population passed 8 billion, according to UN estimates. In a the first of a series of dispatches from the frontline of population growth, Hannah Ellis-Petersen reports from India, which next year will overtake China as the planet\u2019s most populous nation, on what the shift means for the world. The US midterm elections saw the Democrats fare better than expected, retaining control of the Senate despite looking likely to lose control of the House by a small margin to the Republicans. The more consequential outcome may be for Donald Trump: Chris McGreal and David Smith ask if the former president\u2019s grip on the GOP is weakening, and if his rival Ron DeSantis\u2019s time may be coming.

                    "body": "As the World Cup approaches, Qatar is going to need at least 10,000 litres of water every day for each of its stadium pitches. Based in a region with virtually no access to fresh water, it is going to rely on desalination \u2013 the practice of debrining saltwater so it is drinkable. It seems like an elegant solution \u2013 but the problem is that desalination, which is projected to boom by 37% across the Gulf region in the next five years, has huge environmental costs, in terms of the fossils fuels used to carry out the process, and the marine environment. But without it, how can the arid region possibly quench its thirst? Forty-three per cent of the world\u2019s desalination capacity comes from Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries. Despite the scarcity of water, the GCC are among the highest consumers of it in the world, and heavily dependent on desalination plants. The United Arab Emirates has one of the highest per capita water consumption rates in the world, with people using roughly 500 litres a day \u2013 50% above the global average.  Yet many GCC countries such as the UAE are still keen to promote water-rich lifestyles through desalination efforts. Manicured lawns and waterparks are commonplace across cities, and at the Dubai fountain show, every half hour throughout the day more than 83,000 litres of water shoot up as high as a 50-storey building. But with populations rising, the region\u2019s water industry is facing increasing pressure. \u201cThese plants essentially have rivers running through them. If you look at the desalination capacity across the GCC as a whole, the volume of water flowing through that is about four times the amount of water flowing down the Thames,\u201d says Will Le Quesne, the Middle East programme director for the UK Centre for Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture Science. Maryam Rashed Al Shehhi, an assistant professor of civil infrastructure and environmental engineering at Khalifa University in the UAE, says: \u201cDesalination is our main source of fresh water. It\u2019s a very arid region, and annual rainfall has decreased. So it\u2019s very scary to think about any other sources of water.\u201d Since the 1950s the GCC have been at the vanguard of desalination. The southern coasts of the Gulf are dotted with more than 300 desalination plants \u2013 mostly in Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Kuwait and Bahrain.  Powering the world\u2019s greatest concentration of desalination requires a significant amount of energy. Saudi Arabia, the largest producer, makes up a fifth of the world\u2019s output, with roughly 30 desalination plants burning through 300,000 barrels of crude oil a day. In fact, most desalination plants are oil or gas powered, operating with either thermal processing technology, which collects steam from boiling water and condenses it, or the more modern reverse osmosis technology, which relies heavily on electricity produced using natural gas to power pumps that force water through very fine membranes, essentially straining out the salts in the water. \u201cEither way, you need quite a lot of energy. That can be derived from a lot of sources including by burning fossil fuels,\u201d says Le Quesne.  So although Qatar maintains the World Cup will be carbon-neutral, climate organisations are already expressing doubts. The water demands alone are eye-watering. The tournament will need to manage pitches across eight stadiums, and more than 130 additional training grounds. The delicate and complicated process of creating the right turf for football in the Qatar climate just as the weather begins to cool means the groundsmen have to mimic winter, expert Haitham Al Shareef told Reuters, blowing chilled air over the grass and watering the pitch with at least 10,000 litres of desalinated water. And for emergencies, \u201ca 425,000 sq metre reserve of grass \u2013 some 40 soccer pitches worth \u2013 is growing at a farm north of Doha\u201d. The water consumption of that patch is not recorded. And despite national commitments to reducing carbon emissions and meeting net zero targets, the region is expecting to do more desalination, not less, with capacity planned to expand 37% by 2027.  This could be devastating for the Gulf\u2019s marine ecosystem, says Le Quesne. Desalination is one of the worst marine pollution drivers around the world, producing brine, a highly saline waste fluid usually released into the sea as saltier, toxic and warmer seawater. It can contain chemicals such as chlorine, heavy metals, and anti-foaming agents that are added during the desalination process, which can harm coral reefs and smaller marine organisms that live on the seabed. Along with water, smaller organisms also risk getting sucked into the system and can get impinged, crashing into the screens of the intake pipes, or entrained, travelling with water reaching the plant, resulting in severe injury and death.  \u201cThe microscopic plants of the sea, things like fish eggs, will all get drawn into the system and experience very high levels of mortality. Most of them are typically destroyed on their way through the system,\u201d says Le Quesne. With growing environmental concerns, GCC countries including the UAE and Oman are exploring methods involving solar energy.  By far the most ambitious plan is Saudi Arabia\u2019s solar dome, the world\u2019s first zero-brine discharge desalination plant. Announced in 2020, the project is now being prototyped as part of Neom, the outlandish $500bn (\u00a3447bn) planned megacity. Partnering with a London-based company, Solar Water, the 20-metre high dome made from glass and steel is proposed to be surrounded by mirrors that will collect sunlight to heat up the seawater, condense it in a separate chamber, and distill it into fresh water. \u201cThe dome itself will be illuminated by this strong sunlight. It\u2019ll look like a sparkling jewel in the desert,\u201d says Christopher Sansom, a professor of concentrating solar power at the University of Derby and a director at Solar Water. But although the solar dome will, the designers say, be cheaper to build and operate than conventional plants, it will also produce significantly less water. Though Saudi Arabia has no shortage of sunlight, solar-powered desalination can have its limitations, says Sansom. Any interference with clouds or wind can stop the power from being generated. Dust is another factor that can hinder the technology. In a desert environment such as Saudi Arabia, solar panels need to be wiped clean. While promising, Al Shehhi says desalination plants running completely with solar energy is not yet practical and more research is needed into implementing more renewable energy into the desalination process. \u201cIt\u2019s a challenge. The amount of water pumped every day from the Gulf to be desalinated is huge,\u201d she says. And that is before a World Cup is added into the equation. \u2022 This article was amended on 10 October 2022. An earlier version referred incorrectly to \u201c144 pitches across eight stadiums\u201d. The headline was also changed to more accurately reflect that the Qatar World Cup is part of the water strain issues affecting the Gulf region, rather than the sole cause of it."

                    "body": "The deaths of migrant workers in Qatar in the build-up to this year\u2019s World Cup have drawn criticism across the world. While the tournament\u2019s organizers put the official count at 40, estimates by the Guardian put the figure in the thousands. Here we explore the key questions around an issue that has tarnished the World Cup for many fans.\nWhy is this World Cup so controversial?\nWorld soccer\u2019s governing body, Fifa, awarded Qatar \u2013 a country slightly smaller than Connecticut with scant soccer pedigree \u2013 the tournament in December 2010 in a bidding process that, according to American authorities, was riddled with corruption. The shock decision sparked a frenzy of construction in the wealthy nation, which this year became the planet\u2019s biggest exporter of liquefied natural gas.\nThe high profile of the tournament has drawn attention to Qatar\u2019s dubious human rights record, including its hostility towards LGBT people, and the dangerous and exploitative conditions faced by the vast numbers of migrant workers who have built the infrastructure.\n\n\u201cMigrant workers were indispensable to making the World Cup 2022 possible, but it has come at great cost for many migrant workers and their families who not only made personal sacrifices, but also faced widespread wage theft, injuries, and thousands of unexplained deaths,\u201d said Rothna Begum, senior researcher at Human Rights Watch.\n\nHow many migrant workers are in Qatar and where do they come from?\nThe population of Qatar is about three million, roughly 88% of whom are foreign citizens. The migrant workforce is estimated at two million, comprising 95% of the labor force. About a million people are employed in construction and another 100,000 are domestic workers. Mostly men, a large percentage come from the Philippines and south Asian countries including India, Pakistan, Nepal and Bangladesh.\nWhat are they building?\nThe first Middle Eastern country to host the World Cup finals, Qatar has spent anywhere from $220bn-$300bn on infrastructure projects as it uses the globe\u2019s biggest sporting event as a catalyst for nation-building.\nAt a cost of $6.5bn, Qatar has built seven new stadiums for the tournament and renovated an eighth. Other construction projects have included major upgrades to public transport and roads, and new skyscrapers, hotels and housing, as well as Lusail, a new city that will host the final.\n\nWhat is the latest death toll?\nThe official count among workers on World Cup sites is 37 non-work related deaths and only three from work-related accidents but many believe that is a vast undercount.\nThe problem is that it is hard to associate a firm figure with the tournament and to assess how many deaths were preventable given the lack of available information. Fifa and the Qatari organizers have sought to distance World Cup-related construction from more general projects, though it is likely that many of these would not have been commissioned without the tournament-inspired boom. And they have been on tight deadlines to be ready for the influx of an estimated 1.2 million soccer fans.\n\nOverall, 15,021 non-Qataris died in the country between 2010 and 2019, according to the government. A Guardian analysis in February 2021 found that more than 6,500 migrant workers from India, Pakistan, Nepal, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka had died in Qatar since the award of the tournament. The death records were not categorised by occupation or place of work. The government has said that 30,000 foreign laborers were employed to build World Cup stadiums.\nThe International Labour Organization (ILO) found that in 2020, 50 people suffered work-related deaths, 500 were seriously injured, and 37,600 sustained mild to moderate injuries.\nHow are workers dying?\nAverage high temperatures in Qatar exceed 100F (37.7C) for five months of the year. Though the tournament was moved from summer to winter for the safety and comfort of players, officials and fans, workers are at risk of accidents, heat-related illnesses and other ailments related to the physical and mental strains of working long hours in extreme heat. Suicide is also a concern. Construction workers frequently live in squalid conditions that stand in stark contrast with the opulence of many of the facilities they build.\n\nThe Qatari government has argued that \u201cthe mortality rate among these communities is within the expected range for the size and demographics of the population.\u201d But statistics show that a large number of young or middle-aged men from Nepal, who would have undergone health checks before being allowed to enter Qatar, have died from heart problems.\nFollowing on from reporting by the Guardian\u2019s Pete Pattisson, an Amnesty International report from 2021 accused Qatar of \u201croutinely [issuing] death certificates for migrant workers without conducting adequate investigations, instead attributing deaths to \u201cnatural causes\u201d or vaguely defined \u201ccardiac failures\u201d \u2013 making it impossible for bereaved families to claim compensation.\nThe organization found that as many of 70% of migrant deaths are classified imprecisely, with Guardian data suggesting that 69% of deaths among Indian, Nepali and Bangladeshi workers have been categorised as natural. The ILO report states that falls from height and road traffic accidents were the leading causes of severe injuries.\nIn 2021 the Guardian highlighted the deaths of workers such as Gangaram Mandal, a laborer from Nepal who came to Qatar in 2018 in order to support his wife and seven daughters. He borrowed money to pay a recruitment fee then earned the equivalent of a dollar a day. After two years he fell ill at the end of a shift during the summer. His death was classed as \u201cheart failure, natural causes\u201d.\n\nWhat have the Qatari authorities done?\nThe country has introduced labor law reforms in the past five years, though critics charge that these do not go far enough to protect workers and that enforcement is patchy. \u201cThousands of workers across all projects are still facing issues such as delayed or unpaid wages, denial of rest days, unsafe working conditions, barriers to changing jobs, and limited access to justice, while the deaths of thousands of workers remain uninvestigated,\u201d according to Amnesty. A minimum wage for all workers equivalent to about $275 a month came into force in 2021.\nWhat have the soccer authorities said?\nTeams such as Denmark and the Netherlands have been far more vocal in their criticism of working conditions and human rights than Fifa, which has banned players from wearing \u201cOneLove\u201d rainbow armbands. Shortly before the tournament the Fifa president, Gianni Infantino, urged teams to \u201cfocus on the football\u201d.\nInfantino later claimed Fifa deserved credit for influencing Qatar to improve standards, including abolishing its abusive \u201ckafala\u201d worker sponsorship system, and said that criticism of the country reeked of Western hypocrisy.\nConcerns about LGBT rights, forced labor and unsafe conditions also marred the previous World Cup, in Russia in 2018. A report by the Building and Wood Workers\u2019 International union group found that 21 construction workers died building stadiums in Russia, mostly as a result of falls from heights or being struck by falling equipment."

                    "body": "Peter Tatchell has warned Qatar that the world\u2019s eyes will be on the country during the World Cup, as protesters gathered outside its embassy in London to highlight the dangers faced by LGBTQ+ people, women and migrant workers. Tatchell said it was \u201coutrageous\u201d that figures including David Beckham were promoting Qatar and the tournament, in effect asking fans to ignore human rights abuses and the country\u2019s record on LGBTQ+ issues. Tatchell, 70, who was arrested in Doha in October for staging a one-man protest outside the National Museum of Qatar, was speaking at the demonstration on Saturday, in an area of London peppered with embassies and high commissions, a stone\u2019s throw from Hyde Park. Tatchell said: \u201cOur message to Qatar is that the world is watching. We are here to shine a light on the regime\u2019s abuse of women, of LGBTs and migrant workers. We are also sending a message of love and solidarity with those very brave Qataris who are struggling for democracy and human rights.\u201d On the eve of the World Cup\u2019s opening match, he called for fans to boycott games, but to share stories about the situation in the country if they were still watching them. \u201cI can understand why fans would want to watch the matches. But I\u2019d ask them to use their social media to amplify the human rights abuses in Qatar and to call out Fifa over its collusion with what is a sexist, homophobic and racist dictatorship,\u201d he said. Under the overcast skies of central London, the crowd of 50 people shouted \u201cno freedom, no football\u201d, and \u201cshame on Fifa, shame on Qatar\u201d. David Beckham\u2019s name was booed and met with a chant of \u201cshame on Beckham\u201d. Once considered a gay icon, the former England captain has taken a reported \u00a3150m deal to promote Qatar. The comedian Joe Lycett has said he will shred \u00a310,000 of his own money on Sunday if Beckham does not end the sponsorship deal before the tournament starts, in a protest over Qatar\u2019s laws \u2013 which include criminalisation of homosexuality. On Saturday Lycett tweeted a photograph of what appears to be a stack of cash with the caption \u201c24 hours to go\u2026 #benderslikeBeckham\u201d. Tatchell said: \u201cIt\u2019s outrageous that celebrities like David Beckham, who claim to be allies of the LGBTQ+ community, have described the Qatar regime as \u2018perfection\u2019, despite the fact that LGBT Qataris are subject to online entrapment, \u2018honour\u2019 killing, jailing and forced conversion therapy.\u201d Carl Fearn, the co-chair of Gay Gooners, an LGBTQ+ group for Arsenal fans, called for Fifa, Uefa and the International Olympics Committee to never hold a tournament where being LGBTQ+ is criminalised. \u201cThere should never again be a tournament held where it is possible to be executed for being LGBT+,\u201d Fearn said. \u201cOur protest is not about flying rainbow flags and holding hands. It goes deeper than that. It is about LGBT+ people\u2019s right to exist, and exist equally with other people.\u201d On Saturday morning, the Fifa president, Gianni Infantino, gave a press conference where he appeared to brush aside concerns about human rights abuses in Qatar and said that criticism over LGBT+ rights would end up \u201cclosing doors\u201d. There was unhappiness about his comments, along with those of the foreign secretary, James Cleverley, who said fans should show \u201cflex and compromise\u201d and should \u201cbe respectful of the host nation\u201d. Fearn, 59 from Barrow-in-Furness, said that the Fifa head\u2019s comments were \u201ccrass\u201d, adding: \u201cPersonally, we have a foreign secretary of colour, which is absolutely fantastic and shows progressive Britain. However, if a foreign secretary had asked someone to be \u2018less black\u2019 at a tournament or a country, imagine the response. But he asked LGBT people to do that.\u201d Amelia Graham, a 15-year-old from east London who spoke tearfully at the protest, said: \u201cI just feel so horrible for the people in Qatar who have no voice, people all around the world, and I felt it\u2019s important as someone part of the LGBT community to stand up for people who are similar to me, or the same as me, or who need help. \u201cIt\u2019s emotional because people like me are struggling and being killed and arrested, it\u2019s horrible. It\u2019s important to speak out and do whatever we can.\u201d Earlier this week Beckham said Qatar and its ambassadors were changing lives for the better. \u201cEvery one of the great players I was lucky enough to play with started exactly the same way,\u201d he told a youth festival in Doha. \u201cIn a back garden, park, or a street outside their home with just a ball and an imagination that they dared to let run wild. \u201cAlmost two decades ago, a small group of football lovers from Qatar had an equally fantastic dream: that they could bring the greatest football show on Earth to their home country and to the Middle East for the very first time. And now we are here.\u201d"

                    "body": "I must have been 10 when I went to a football match with my parents and realised that the game resonated far beyond the field of play. The game was at the Cooperage Stadium in Mumbai and we had gone to see East Bengal, a legendary Indian team, play in a cup competition. The team had been formed during the days of the Raj to represent the Hindus of East Bengal. This was where my father had grown up, amid much luxury, our family being part of the rich Hindu minority that dominated East Bengal, where most of the population was Muslim. All of this was lost in 1947 as a result of the partition of India, when East Bengal became East Pakistan, now Bangladesh, and millions of Hindus left. My father, who had made Mumbai his home, knew he could never go back. Watching the East Bengal team that Sunday afternoon was his way of connecting with the land he always regarded as home and whose loss he mourned. As East Bengal won, my father\u2019s spirits lifted. Like my father, millions will be supporting their teams during the Qatar World Cup for reasons that go far beyond 22 men kicking a ball for 90 minutes. They will do so, despite the World Cup being held in a country with a dreadful human rights record and whose treatment of migrant workers is appalling. I am under no illusions, having visited Qatar, met the migrants who built the stadiums and seen their dreadful living conditions. But, despite that, I will be in front of my television on Sunday afternoon when Qatar kicks off the competition. At every professional level, the game is no longer the pleasant weekend activity of my youth. It is now a sordid marriage between money and football\u2019s power barons, with the fans used as pawns to preserve the myth of the beautiful game. Nobody works at preserving that myth better than Fifa, the world body that controls the game. If proof were needed, it was provided on Tuesday. As the England team flew into Qatar in a jet that advertised its support for LGBT rights, Gianni Infantino, the president of Fifa, was in Bali lecturing world leaders at the G20 summit that the World Cup could be used to stop the Russian devastation of Ukraine. Infantino is not the first Fifa president to make such ridiculous claims. His predecessor, the infamous Sepp Blatter, made the idea of Fifa going where the United Nations could not go almost an art form. It reflects the fact that these leaders see themselves not as running sports bodies but managing mini-states.  In England, we can hardly claim the moral high ground, having paid our obeisance to Fifa for years. During both the England bids for the 2006 and 2018 World Cups our political leaders courted Fifa, and Blatter was received at No 10 as if he were the head of a sovereign state. At a reception for him in Downing Street, David Cameron said, \u201cOne of the first things I did when I became prime minister was to call you to reconfirm the new government\u2019s full support for England 2018\u201d, adding unctuously, \u201cMr President, you have done a huge amount for football during your whole life. The decisions you have made have been instrumental in taking the game to new heights.\u201d Such heights. On Blatter\u2019s watch, during the four decades when he was first Fifa general secretary and then president, multiple World Cup votes became the subject of corruption allegations. During the 2006 bid, the Treasury was persuaded to provide a financial guarantee to please Blatter. Manchester United wanted this before it would agree to miss the FA Cup and take part in the Fifa Club World Cup in Brazil. This was a pet Blatter project and, it was argued, necessary to help England secure crucial votes. The difference with Qatar is that, while England failed dismally in its courtship of Fifa, eliminated on both bids with only two votes, Qatar succeeded. Qatar has always denied charges of corruption. However, 16 of the 22 who chose Qatar have found themselves accused, banned or indicted over allegations of corruption or wrongdoing. Blatter has also been banned by Fifa.  What is also telling is how late the whole question of human rights in Qatar has emerged. I was in Zurich on 2 December 2010 when Qatar was chosen. The human rights issue raised related to Russia, which had won the 2018 bid. Vladimir Putin, having jetted in to celebrate, batted away my question on the subject. And when I asked him who would pay for the World Cup, he pointed to Roman Abramovich, who was sitting in the front row, saying he was a rich man. Abramovich, then owner of Chelsea, smiled, having supported his country\u2019s bid. It is such alliances between politics and business that underpin modern sport, and something we in this country happily accept.  Having covered several World Cups, I am well aware of the contrast between Fifa barons and football fans. It is common for these barons to fly in first class and stay in luxurious hotels, all expenses paid, for the meetings that precede the competition. But once these finish, most of these barons fly off before the tournament begins. For them football is business. In contrast, fans scrabble for match tickets because for them the game represents something that is increasingly rare in modern life. Why? Because football can be a source of hope and belief and a space to express extreme feelings, a sense of right and wrong, even a glimpse of another kind of existence. Supporting a team or player gives you multiple ways to put some meaning into your life and to express your identity. Your favourite player can be an imaginary family member, companion or lover. Your chosen team can put you into a community that is as big or as small as you might wish. Season ticket holders at a football club, sitting next to the same person every other week and watching their favourite team for years, develop bonds that little else in our society can create. And with religion playing an increasingly insignificant role in our lives, this gives a very special meaning to those watching football and other sports. A successful team can also have a dramatic impact, as I found during the summer. In August, immediately after England\u2019s Lionesses won the Euros, my daughter sent me a WhatsApp message, \u201cHope you are watching. We won.\u201d I was surprised as I had often taken her to watch live football but, frankly, she had never shown much interest in the game. Now, having watched the women\u2019s victory with friends, she felt elated. We cannot watch the World Cup in Qatar with that same innocence. We know how it got there. We know what it says about those involved and those exploited to bring it about. But we will watch, hoping that the humanity in the beautiful game outweighs the ugliness of the path it has taken. We love this game. We cannot do otherwise.  Mihir Bose is a writer and broadcaster whose latest book is Dreaming The Impossible: The Battle to Create a Non-Racial Sports World "

                    "body": "There are now less than 50 days to the World Cup in Qatar, which promoters have taken to describing as a tournament \u201clike no other\u201d. For once the PR hype is justified, and not only because the matches will be played during the lead-up to Christmas rather than in summer. The decision to stage the planet\u2019s biggest sporting event in a country with a notoriously poor human rights record is provoking unprecedented queasiness among competing nations. Last week, in conjunction with the kit manufacturer Hummel, the Danish football federation unveiled a plain all-black third kit for the tournament. It was designed, said Hummel, in memory of the many migrant workers who died during construction work in the years leading up to the finals. The captains of some European teams \u2013 including England\u2019s Harry Kane \u2013 aim to wear rainbow \u201cOne Love\u201d armbands, symbolising opposition to discrimination in a country where homosexual acts are illegal. The German federation invited a gay fan to use its platform at an event to address the Qatari ambassador on the subject of LGBT rights. Abdulla bin Mohammed bin Saud Al Thani reportedly responded that human rights issues were distracting from the tournament. To the extent that this is true, it is of course a good thing. High-profile gestures by companies such as Hummel are far better than nothing at all. But time is running out for the kind of action that could leave a lasting positive legacy from a World Cup that should never have been awarded to these hosts. Football is a global game and a tournament in the Middle East is desirable in principle, but this is not the way. With justification, Qatari authorities claim they have responded to pressure to reform brutally exploitative conditions for migrant workers. The hated kafala system, for example \u2013 which tied a worker to a single employer \u2013 has gone, and attempts have been made to compensate for unpaid wages and introduce minimum pay. But the latest in a series of Guardian investigations, published last month, found that, despite high-level initiatives and reassurances, abusive practices were still rife on the ground. Migrant workers at the Al Bayt stadium, where England will play the USA on 25 November, had been obliged to pay huge illegal recruitment fees and lived for months in unfit, overcrowded accommodation, earning \u00a31 an hour. Elsewhere, labourers spoke of 12-hour shifts, six days a week, without proper overtime pay. A climate of fear inhibited many from speaking out about conditions. Migrant workers who have returned home ahead of the World Cup say they were sent back before finishing their contracts or without receiving all they claim they were owed. A recent YouGov poll, commissioned by Amnesty International, found huge support for a compensation fund for migrant workers who have been mistreated, and for the relatives of those who died. Amnesty, along with other human rights groups, are campaigning for Fifa, world football\u2019s governing body, to set up such a fund using a fraction of anticipated profits of $7bn. The amount proposed is $440m \u2013 equivalent to World Cup prize money on offer. After prolonged hesitation, the English FA has now backed the principle of a fund, as have high-profile figures in football such as the Dutch national team manager, Louis van Gaal, and the Brazil coach, Tite. Fifa has said it is thinking about it. It\u2019s time to stop thinking and act."

                    "body": "It was in mid-air on the final leg to Doha that Hassan realised exactly what lay in store. He was travelling from Paris, via Istanbul, with his friends Manal and Zouhair after hours of searching for a ticket to Morocco against Spain finally paid off. \u201cI didn\u2019t understand what I was seeing and hearing,\u201d he says. \u201cThere were Egyptians, Jordanians, Iraqis, Yemenis \u2013 all of them had left their families and their jobs, just to come and support Morocco.\u201d\nHassan pulls up a video on his phone: almost every passenger is on their feet, chanting his homeland\u2019s name. It was Monday night and, within 24 hours, they would witness history. Morocco had never reached the last eight of a World Cup before; if they defeat Portugal on Saturday they will do what nobody from their continent has ever managed, breaking Africa\u2019s semi-final duck at last.\n\u201cSometimes it feels like Morocco is hosting this tournament,\u201d Hassan says. He is hardly exaggerating. The three are walking along Doha\u2019s Corniche, a few minutes from what has become the supporters\u2019 hub of Souq Waqif. Now three quarters of the teams have gone home, the huge Moroccan and Argentinian contingents have the run of the place. They were prominent all along but there is a subtle difference now. Those draped in the red flag with the five-pointed green star are almost as likely to come from other countries, speak in subtly different dialects and be steeped in variations of the same culture. Morocco carry the hopes of the Arab world and everyone is onboard.\n\nIt is a marvel that reflects one of this tournament\u2019s many parallel, sometimes awkwardly jarring dimensions: for fans from countries in the Middle East and north Africa, Qatar 2022 has been a chance for a generally underrepresented football region to be seen and heard. It is a powerful common cause, transcending national boundaries and local antagonisms. Success means something extra. The atmosphere in the Souq and at games has been loud, vivid, colourful, celebratory, but at the same time respectful and gentle.\n\u201cWe\u2019re all the same country, the same team,\u201d says Aymen, who moved to Qatar five years ago from the Tunisian city Sousse. \u201cI watched Tunisia\u2019s games at the stadium but after they were knocked out the decision was simple: get behind Morocco and see how far they can go,\u201d he says. \u201cTheir victory is a victory for every Arab.\u201d Ahmed, who is from south-west Morocco and works in Doha as a waiter, says: \u201cIt\u2019s an incredible feeling to see all our countries coming together like this.\u201d\n\nThere is a cautious sense in a few quarters that something has changed. Nourredine, who has travelled from Morocco and identifies as Arab and Berber, says he had previously felt his countrymen were looked down by Arabs from the Middle East. He has seen no sign of that in the past three weeks, only kinship, and feels encouraged; it is the same for Fadel, who is from close neighbour Mauritania and has lived in Doha for 12 years. \u201cThe passport is nothing to us,\u201d he says. \u201cI feel Arabic, and that\u2019s it: we\u2019re not asking each other where we are from.\u201d\nFadel is with Mohammed, who describes greeting several Moroccan friends who had visited for the Spain game on a round trip lasting less than one day. Hassan and his companions did not have time to tell their employers that they would be unavailable for a chunk of this week after his all-night trawl for tickets had borne fruit; they extended their trip after getting lucky again for the Portugal game. Manal\u2019s brother will join them: he is flying over from Casablanca on one of seven planes that sold out in minutes.\n\u201cWe are living a dream,\u201d says Hassan, who is still noticeably hoarse three days after Achraf Hakimi\u2019s historic shootout winner. \u201cWe had to take a risk but I don\u2019t regret coming here. One day we will be proud to tell our children that we were there in the stadium for Morocco\u2019s first quarter-final. And it\u2019s amazing to have everyone behind us.\u201d\n\nThe crowd at Al Thumama Stadium will be, if recent evidence is anything to go by, at least 80% in favour of Morocco. Many others will watch elsewhere in the city: estimates suggest well over 50,000 Moroccans could be in town. There are parallels to 2010, when all of Africa appeared to coalesce around Ghana for their tie with Uruguay. That night a different dream was scuppered by Luis Su\u00e1rez and a disastrous run of penalties; this time up to 450 million Arabs hope to go one step further. \u201cWe have a feeling we can do it,\u201d Manal says. Zouhair agrees, and adds: \u201cIf you don\u2019t believe once you\u2019re in a quarter-final, I don\u2019t know when you\u2019re going to believe.\u201d\nWill they be tempted to keep their bosses waiting a few more days if the impossible becomes real? Manal and Zouhair shake their heads: the trip of a lifetime will have to end on Sunday, come what may. Hassan cannot quite bring himself to say it. \u201cI might have the possibility, I\u2019ll have to think about it,\u201d he says, a mischievous glint crossing his eyes. There may not be much to consider if Morocco keep flying the regional flag a little longer."

                    "body": "Qatar became the first team to be knocked out of the World Cup after a humbling defeat at the hands of Senegal and Ecuador\u2019s draw with the Netherlands, but the host team\u2019s fans inside a half-full Al-Thumama stadium had at least some consolation: they got to see a goal.\nSenegal were far from impressive but still had too much for their hapless opponents who have made a strong case for the title of worst home nation of all time. For the Africa Cup of Nations champions, meanwhile, this was a shot in the arm and gives hope of qualification from Group A .\nWhat this all means for Qatar, as with so many issues off the field during this tournament, is difficult to discern. Once again the coach, F\u00e9lix S\u00e1nchez, saw his team play in front of a crowd that largely gave up, a patchy attendance falling away in the second half. If this indicated disappointment among local support, however, the Spaniard did not see it that way.\n\n\u201cWe are very happy with today\u2019s attendance and very proud of the fans who came to show their love throughout the game,\u201d S\u00e1nchez said. \u201cToday we showed what we are able to do: we were competitive and beyond the result we played well. You need to know where we\u2019re coming from. If you think [being eliminated] is a failure, then that depends on expectations.\u201d\nThe consensus among local media appeared to be that this was a stronger performance from Qatar than against Ecuador, but if so then the margins were fine. While the forward Akram Afif continued to do his best to create some kind of cutting edge for his team, most of his colleagues were not on the same wavelength, and a misplaced pass or hashed clearance was never far away. It was a reflection of the uncertainty in Senegal\u2019s play that this game was not decided much earlier.\n\nAfter the Teranga Lions\u2019 opening defeat by the Netherlands, Aliou Ciss\u00e9 changed his formation and a more assertive 4-4-2 paid dividends as both strikers got on the scoresheet. Boulaye Dia seized upon a terrible Qatar error \u2013 the defender Boualem Khoukhi not only scuffing a clearance but falling on to his behind in the bargain \u2013 to fire home with four minutes of the first half remaining. Famara Di\u00e9dhiou doubled the lead shortly after half-time with a well-executed looping header.\n\u201cWhen you want to score goals maybe you need to increase the number of forwards,\u201d Ciss\u00e9 observed wryly afterwards, and he will hope the three points will help restore confidence among a squad not only rocked by their late defeat on Monday but by the enduring absence of their talisman, Sadio Man\u00e9.\n\u201cThis is not the end of the road; our objective is to get out of the group stages and we know what needs to be done,\u201d Ciss\u00e9 said, with Ecuador their final group opponents on Tuesday. \u201cWe need to win, we need to perform like we did today. The result today has given meaning to everything we\u2019ve done and we will savour the result, even though we have to face the next game.\u201d\nHis upbeat remarks appeared to be good management from Ciss\u00e9 but the coach will surely feel there is more to come from his team in terms of approach play, and he was frustrated with the way with which \u2013 at 2-0 \u2013 they lost focus to let Qatar back in the game.\n\n\u00c9douard Mendy, the villain of the piece against the Netherlands, had to be at his athletic best to deny first Almoez Ali from distance and then Ismaeel Mohammad from point-blank range (an attempted header that came off the wing-back\u2019s knee). With 12 minutes remaining, the Chelsea man was helpless as the substitute Mohammed Muntari rose from a standing start to nod home Mohammad\u2019s impressive swirling cross.\nThe crowd got up for the goal, and cheered loudly enough, but it was not sufficient to drown out the Senegal drumming band whose unceasing rhythm drove the atmosphere in the stadium throughout. Senegal restored their two-goal advantage with six minutes of normal time remaining as Bamba Dieng swept home a cutback from Iliman Ndiaye after impressive approach play from the Sheffield United man. Small steps for Senegal here, but they are still in the tournament and Ciss\u00e9, asked whether an African team could win this thing, replied simply: \u201cYes.\u201d"

Being socially awkward, we obviously didn\u2019t want to do this, but Weird Uncle Fiver got angry and then frighteningly insistent that we should create a chat group to organise the family trip to Pontins in Prestatyn. He\u2019s got a job as a big green crocodile mascot there, you see, and can swing a discount. Once he\u2019d added all our cousins to it, he invited all 768 members to have our say on what dates would be best for everyone. Ping! Ping! Ping! Ping! Ping! After a fair bit of back and forth, we soon sorted out a weekend in August. Then he asked if anyone was interested in one of the limited number of all-inclusive wristbands for the on-site pub. Ping! Ping! Ping! Ping! Ping! Ping! Ping! Ping! Ping! Ping! Ping! Ping! Ping! Ping! Ping! Ping! Ping! Ping! Such an onslaught of information was too much for our simple senses. We needed a lie down.  We hope officials at the Human Rights World Cup are made of sterner stuff than us. They\u2019re going to be hit with a torrent of data sent from match balls \u201c500 times per second\u201d thanks to new AI-powered technology that Fifa bigwigs have signed off on. Ping! Ping! Ping! Ping! Ping! Ping! Ping! Ping! Ping! Ping! Ping! Ping! Ping! Yes, Gianni Infantino has unleashed the bots in an effort to speed up VAR decisions. It\u2019s got its own name too: Semi-automated offside technology (SAOT). Sounds well $exy doesn\u2019t it? Apparently SAOT is \u201cfaster and more accurate and offers better communication to fans.\u201d And you better believe it because those words were uttered by legendary Italian whistleblower Pierluigi Collina, the chief suit of Fifa\u2019s referees committee, who looks like he could zap any pessimists with lasers shot out of his intense, staring eyes. \u201cIt can create a new form of visualisation for supporters at home and in the ground. All tests have worked well and so [SAOT] is going into [the Human Rights] World Cup.\u201d The ball will have a well-clever sensor in it that transmits all this info to create a 3D map of the goalscoring action which*checks notes* will help officials come to an offside decision in around 25 seconds, instead of the current VAR average of 70. Collina wasn\u2019t forthcoming on what happens if the sensor gets rattled out of position by a powerful punt from Harry Maguire. Nor did he have much to say on how much time and money had been spent on this advancement, which could go haywire if technology goes rogue and develops bias towards one nation or another as top lads on Twitter will no doubt accuse it of doing. And lord knows what the new Premier League VAR overlord, Mike Dean, will do with it if it gets rolled out globally (to leagues that can afford it). The world might need Will Smith to save us if Dean uses the AI to assist in a power grab. But what The Fiver finds most interesting about all of this is how Fifa found the time and resources to \u201cimprove\u201d VAR with AI ball-bots, yet couldn\u2019t use its heft to get Qatari authorities to guarantee that LGBTQ+ fans would be safe at the HRWC.

                    "body": "When the England team arrive at Al Bayt stadium for their match against the USA in just over two months, they will be met by a stunning 60,000-seat arena built to resemble a nomadic tent. The stadium, arguably Qatar\u2019s finest, will host matches from the opening game through to the semi-finals. If England win their group and reach that far, they will play four games at the ground. Just as impressive is the pristine park surrounding the stadium. Manicured lawns are dotted with fountains, streams and a lake. Ducks play in the cool water. A running track winds its way around the stadium passing a number of immaculate training pitches with grass like a putting green.  Yet the men who labour day after day in the relentless heat and humidity to maintain this remarkable green space \u2013 watering the grounds, cutting the grass and painstakingly pulling up weeds by hand \u2013 live in very different conditions. At the end of each shift, they are driven for 40 minutes to the edge of the desert, where they are dropped off at a farm belonging to their employer, Al Sulaiteen Agricultural and Industrial Complex (SAIC). Inside, among rows of giant greenhouses, they return to their rooms in small rundown cabins. Some house three or four workers in single beds, others five or six in bunks, but all those viewed by the Guardian were windowless, cramped and dirty. Towels draped between the upper and lower bunks provide what little privacy there is. Water bottles, cooking utensils and personal belongings are crammed under the beds. Clothes hang on lines strung across the walls. The camp is as squalid as any this journalist has seen in nine years of reporting from Qatar.  Fifa and the local World Cup organising body, the Supreme Committee for Delivery and Legacy (SC), have repeatedly claimed that the tournament has been the catalyst to transform the living and working conditions of low-wage labourers, in Qatar and across the region, but the Guardian\u2019s findings expose serious shortcomings in the reform process.   Workers employed on World Cup-related projects are supposed to enjoy superior treatment in line with stringent \u201cworkers\u2019 welfare standards\u201d, but in interviews this summer with workers employed by SAIC at three World Cup stadiums \u2013 Al Bayt, Al Janoub and Ahmad Bin Ali \u2013 the Guardian heard allegations of multiple breaches of these standards. All the workers interviewed, who are from Bangladesh, Nepal and India, say they were forced to pay illegal fees to agents in their own countries to secure their jobs. \u201cI paid 300,000 [Bangladeshi taka],\u201d says one worker, the equivalent of nearly \u00a32,700, a huge sum in Bangladesh. \u201cSome pay a little more, some a little less, but everyone pays.\u201d The local organising committee of the World Cup introduced a scheme in 2017 to encourage its contractors to repay their workers\u2019 recruitment fees. The committee said SAIC participates in the scheme and has reimbursed \u00a329,000 to workers employed on contracts it has awarded SAIC. Yet SAIC workers interviewed by the Guardian, who are not working under a contract for the World Cup committee, say they have received nothing.  Most of the interviewed workers are earning a basic wage of 1,000 riyals (\u00a3225) a month, the equivalent of about \u00a31 an hour. Food and accommodation are provided by SAIC. The wage is the legal minimum in Qatar, but workers say they are struggling to repay their recruitment fees, and associated debts, and send money to their families on this salary. \u201cThe salary is very low, it\u2019s very difficult. I can earn this in India,\u201d says one worker who, after deducting his costs in Qatar, is able to send about \u00a3160 to his wife and four children each month. In the face of relentless criticism of its treatment of low-wage migrant workers, Qatar announced a new law in 2020 which promised to remove the abusive kafala system \u2013 under which workers were unable to change jobs \u2013 but the workers say SAIC refuses to release them. \u201cThe company won\u2019t give [permission to leave]. You can only change if you go home, cancel your visa and apply again,\u201d says one worker. Another laughs at the suggestion, saying: \u201cIf we could change jobs, everyone would leave!\u201d  The World Cup organising committee said: \u201cWe recognise that the SAIC workers may still face challenges from their employers.\u201d It encouraged SAIC workers to use its grievance hotline to raise concerns. During the hottest summer months, the workers get up before dawn and head out to the Al Bayt stadium \u2013 which cost \u00a3620m to build. By seven, the heat is unbearable, but Kabir* works on, watering the grass and trees. He did not know he would be working at a World Cup site when he came to Qatar, but it does not seem to interest him. \u201cI\u2019m not excited about the World Cup,\u201d he says with a shrug. \u201cI don\u2019t think we can even go inside the stadium.\u201d  The only thing that really concerns him is his salary. His family depends on his meagre income, but most of his wages go towards buying back the jewellery he gave to a moneylender as collateral so he could afford the \u00a31,170 fee for his job. \u201cQatar is a rich country, but they are paying so little for the work we do,\u201d says Kabir. \u201cYou can forget about good pay here.\u201d The SC said it had \u201cstayed true to its commitment of utilising the World Cup to deliver lasting social changes for our workers, to improve their working and living conditions\u201d. It cited a range of steps that have been taken to raise the working and living standards of workers, including improved accommodation, measures to minimise workers\u2019 exposure to heat, legislation to introduce a minimum wage and allow workers to change jobs, and a monitoring system to ensure companies comply with the law. \u201cIndividual cases of wrongdoing do not present a full and accurate picture of the changes that have taken place in Qatar, where thousands of companies have adjusted their work practices to comply with the new laws and regulations,\u201d it added. England\u2019s Football Association said: \u201cAny questions relating to the stadiums to be used during Qatar 2022 should be directed to tournament organisers Fifa.\u201d It pointed to an earlier statement in which it said: \u201cWe believe that there is evidence of substantial progress being made by Qatar in relation to workers\u2019 rights. However, we recognise there is still more to be done.\u201d Fifa said it was in contact with the SC regarding the allegations raised by SAIC employees. It added: \u201cIn addition to the extensive measures already introduced, which aim to support workers involved in the preparation and delivery of the World Cup, Fifa has actively pushed for the implementation of broader labour reforms that apply to all companies and projects across the country and benefit all workers in Qatar.\u201d SAIC did not respond to requests for comment. * Name has been changed to protect his identity Sign up for a different view with our Global Dispatch newsletter \u2013 a roundup of our top stories from around the world, recommended reads, and thoughts from our team on key development and human rights issues, delivered to your inbox every two weeks: "

                    "body": "If sportswashing was once a novel concept, it now appears standard for major international events. But the World Cup, which kicks off next Sunday, so far seems to have done more to stain the image of football than improve Qatar\u2019s. Diehard fans as well as human rights campaigners have complained that this looks more like a grubby hymn to money and power than a joyous celebration of the game \u2013 even if the drama and tension of the tournament will end up overwhelming many people\u2019s qualms. The shock decision to award Qatar the contest was controversial even in 2010. But with revelations over the treatment of migrant workers and the spotlighting of its anti-gay laws, concern has steadily mounted. Last week, a Qatar World Cup ambassador described homosexuality as \u201cdamage in the mind\u201d and Sepp Blatter, the former head of Fifa, said Qatar was a bad choice as host (though only because it was \u201ctoo small a country\u201d). Defenders of the decision say that high-profile events can be leverage for improvements in human rights. In Qatar\u2019s case, there has been modest progress, including a (very low) minimum wage. But time is running out to effect further change, and there is scepticism about whether even small gains will endure. The 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi and 2018 World Cup did not bring rights improvements in Russia. The years between the 2008 summer Games and this year\u2019s Winter Olympics saw increasing repression in China. Part of the problem is that wealthy but repressive states seem to feel they have the most to gain from hosting such events. It is no secret that Saudi Arabia, which will host the 2029 Asian Winter Games in the heart of the desert, is determined to win an Olympics. Regimes seeking kudos have gained the assistance of sports stars \u2013 from David Beckham to Pep Guardiola \u2013 and international institutions who employ high-flown rhetoric about athletic excellence and global friendship while trousering large sums. Allegations of corruption have long dogged the International Olympic Committee. Sixteen of the 22 voting members of the Fifa executive committee that handed the World Cup to Qatar have since been implicated in or investigated over alleged corruption or bad practice (though not all of them in relation to that decision). Attempts to deflect criticism only make it look worse. Fifa has told national teams that its job is not \u201chanding out moral lessons\u201d and that the game should not be \u201cdragged into every ideological or political battle\u201d. That rightly got short shrift. Ten European football associations \u2013 including those of England and Wales \u2013 replied that \u201chuman rights are universal and apply everywhere\u201d. They have also urged Fifa to deliver on two as-yet unmet promises: a compensation fund and centre for migrant workers. Several national captains will wear rainbow armbands to support the OneLove anti-discrimination campaign. But the challenge posed by sportswashing won\u2019t truly be addressed unless international governing bodies undergo fundamental changes. Though they show little sign of taking that on board, this World Cup suggests that at last some national associations may be starting to think differently. At least some players and officials are realising that football must up its game."

The moment was overwhelming. Not to mention unreal, fabricated, thin, frazzled and fringed with ghosts and waste. Welcome to the opening night of Qatar 2022, an occasion that felt, as it passed in a glaze of colour and borrowed heat, like the end point of something.\n\nThis was the global game in its final form, a private power-show for the benefit of a very small group of very rich people; all played out inside a disposable lighted hanger on a lovely, dusky winter plain 20 miles outside Doha.\nLittle wonder the Qatar players felt the moment. They were 2-0 down by half-time, playing at a level above their capacity, carrying all that weight, and exposed here, held up to the light by the fact that whereas people and presidents and slogans can lie, elite sport rarely does.\nThese players are not simply android specimens of the Qatar Aspire academy. They are, like everyone outside the elite here, essentially a group of workers, seekers of opportunity.\nQatar played poorly here. The players froze, ate the moment, and were easily beaten by Ecuador. There was a fear before this tournament that Qatar would turn out to be the worst host team the World Cup has seen. This is not the case. They are instead the worst host team at a World Cup by miles. In the moment, caught off guard, that flicker of tension felt hearteningly, reassuringly human.\n\nBecause the rest of the night was, frankly, a show with a hole in it, a performance of noisy, insistent unreality. But then, of course it was. Like so many things on this supercharged peninsula the Qatari national team is a kind of screenshot version of reality. Wandering around this place, with its gleaming generic structures, it can be hard to avoid this feeling of the unreal, of a kind of Warhol World Cup, all pastiche and glossy limitation, the fancy buildings made to look like \u201cfancy buildings\u201d, the vast lighted stadiums plonked down in an empty space because the show demands.\nThe Al Bayt is designed to resemble a massive-scale desert tent. And so it does, a vast and trunkless thing rising up out of the lone and level sands. This thing is a minor engineering miracle in its own right, a plateau of perfect green surrounded by desiccated scrub. But it is also a kind of monstrosity, constructed beyond any reasonable sense of scale, a grotesque and needless monument to human vanity.\n\nPlus, like all of these structures, it will remain a kind of lighted mausoleum for the lives lost along the way. At one point in the opening ceremony a large white ghost could be seen rising up from pitch level, spectral, sad, lost-looking. This was of course La\u2019eeb, the in-house mascot sprite, an inhabitant \u2013 it says here \u2013 of the ethereal mascot-verse. It is still hard to process this. Qatar\u2019s mascot, the spirit animal of these blood-stained structures, is a ghost.\nMore unreality. Before kick-off the area behind one goal had been filled with a specially attired troupe of Qatar ultras, who filed in as one then spent the whole game shouting and cheering with what looked like real, genuine, choreographed excitement. Or at least real fake excitement. Maybe even real real excitement. Does it actually matter? The picture looks the same.\nThere was a genuine cheer before kick-off for the former emir, who waved from his box and then shook hands with someone who looked a lot like, and in fact was, Mohammed bin Salman. Relations have warmed. Saudi is, after all, Qatar\u2019s former protector, the regional big brother. But a handshake here was a big deal.\nBefore long the great Gianni also popped up, boggle-eyed and beaming, and looking once again as surprised as anyone else to find himself at the summit. Infantino pronounced some random words referencing love and peace and everyone getting along together. The ground was flooded a deep purple shade. Dancers twirled and drums were pounded. Morgan Freeman, formerly of the US bid team, said stuff about peace and love.\nAnd almost immediately Ecuador scored, had it chalked off, then scored again though a penalty kick rolled into the corner by Enner Valencia. The yellow shirts (real) roared and sang and danced as the rest of the stadium fell silent apart from an oddly taunting disco soundtrack.\n\nQatar were terrible in that opening spell. Spooked, heavy\u2011handed, incoherent in their passing, with a goalkeeper who seemed intent on cartwheeling about in a peeled-eyeball frenzy. But then imagine, if you can, that pressure, the build towards this game over half a lifetime.\nImagine all that when you\u2019re not actually very good, when your basic existence is a hot-housed PR and soft-power project, doomed to be dead-headed at some as-yet unscheduled point. Maybe there is something to be said for building an actual living sporting culture before you stage the greatest show on earth. Expect amazing: expect amazingly bad at football.\nAnd so it rolled on. The colours were good, the purple Fifa awnings, the yellow, the red, the deep green turf. Qatar had no way back on the pitch.\nFaced with the task of scoring twice against an Ecuador team that had not conceded in five matches, they did at least produce more of a show, more of a sense of life in the middle of all that artifice."

                    "body": "It\u2019s six months before the US men\u2019s national team kicks off their World Cup campaign at the Ahmad Bin Ali Stadium in Qatar with a Group B game against Wales, Scotland or Ukraine. With the at-times torturous Concacaf qualifying slog now in the rear-view mirror, here\u2019s a run-down of where the US stands ahead of four fixtures next month, starting with the friendly visit of Morocco to Cincinnati on 1 June. A 27-man squad for the summer fixtures was named on Friday, with call-ups for the uncapped Joe Scally, Malik Tillman and Haji Wright and a return for Cameron Carter-Vickers.  Goalkeeper I Believe That We Will Worry rating 4/5 There\u2019s being composed on the ball and confident in your distribution skills. Then there\u2019s dawdling in possession inside the six-yard box as Sadio Man\u00e9 pounces like a ninja. Zack Steffen\u2019s costly mistake in Manchester City\u2019s FA Cup semi-final loss to Liverpool last month, coming after his addled displays against Panama and Costa Rica, raises concerns that it might all go Rob Green-shaped for the 27-year-old in Qatar. Matt Turner, a better shot-stopper, is just back from injury but leaving the New England Revolution for Arsenal. Neither is likely to be first choice for their club next season, so the risk is they arrive in Qatar lacking competitive action. The tournament surely comes too soon for 18-year-old Chicago Fire starlet Gaga Slonina, who committed to the US over Poland on Friday but was left off the June roster because of recent indifferent form, Berhalter told reporters. Alternatives are back-up Nottingham Forest keeper Ethan Horvath \u2013 but the 26-year-old would likely face the same rust worries as Turner and Steffen \u2013 or New York City FC stalwart Sean Johnson. He was last year\u2019s MLS Cup MVP, but head coach Gregg Berhalter isn\u2019t sold on him as a starter: the 32-year-old\u2019s last national team appearance was in 2020. All in all, a position that\u2019s traditionally a strength \u2013 think Kasey Keller, Brad Friedel, Tim Howard and Brad Guzan (who\u2019s out for the season) \u2013 is now a brow-furrower. Defense Worry rating 3/5 How will the center back pairing of Walker Zimmerman and Miles Robinson, doughty during the latter stages of qualifying but with no club-level experience higher than MLS, fare against the world\u2019s finest forwards? Sadly we\u2019re unlikely to find out now that Robinson is sidelined long-term with a ruptured Achilles tendon sustained playing for Atlanta United. That means a summer of auditions for the role of Zimmerman\u2019s new partner. Cameron Carter-Vickers, who\u2019s been on loan at Celtic from Tottenham, is set for his first opportunity in three years. Perhaps Berhalter beckons the outcast John Brooks back in to the fold, given the 29-year-old\u2019s decent end to the season with Wolfsburg. But he wasn\u2019t picked on Friday, lengthening the odds. Erik Palmer-Brown of Troyes was selected instead. More likely, Robinson\u2019s misfortune opens the door for Bayern Munich\u2019s Chris Richards or the New York Red Bulls\u2019 Aaron Long. The 22-year-old Richards spent the Bundesliga season on loan at Hoffenheim but has endured injury problems this year and didn\u2019t recover in time to make the June roster. Long, 29, impressed before suffering a ruptured Achilles tendon last May that kept him out for eight months. Provided he doesn\u2019t wilt under what\u2019s sure to be a tougher workload now that Fulham are back in the Premier League, the starting left back job is Antonee Robinson\u2019s to lose, with a few greenhorns behind him in a pretty open contest that might be won by Arminia Bielefeld\u2019s George Bello or Kevin Paredes, an uncapped 19-year-old, should he earn enough minutes at Wolfsburg. \u201cThe back-up position is still very much up for grabs,\u201d said Berhalter, who called in Scally, of Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach. In a pinch, Berhalter might prefer to switch across his no-brainer first-choice right back, Barcelona\u2019s Sergi\u00f1o Dest. Inter Miami\u2019s DeAndre Yedlin - a veteran of the 2014 World Cup yet still only 28 - can deputize for the injury-prone 21-year-old, as could Reggie Cannon of Boavista. Midfield Worry rating 2/5 Few dilemmas here, with Juventus\u2019 Weston McKennie the team\u2019s most important player - along with Christian Pulisic - and Tyler Adams (Leipzig), Yunus Musah (Valencia) and Kellyn Acosta (LAFC) virtual certainties for Qatar. The chief intrigue over the next few months will be whether Luca de la Torre of Heracles, Seattle\u2019s Cristian Rold\u00e1n and Montreal\u2019s Djordje Mihailovic continue to press their cases for a seat on the plane to Doha, while fingers are crossed that McKennie returns at full power after the broken foot he suffered in February. And now that Bayern Munich and Germany under-21s attacking midfielder Malik Tillman has switched to the US, he enters the conversation.  Attack Worry rating 3.5/5 Wingers? There are wingers. Pulisic (Chelsea), Tim Weah (Lille), Paul Arriola (Dallas), Brenden Aaronson (Salzburg), Jordan Morris (Seattle), Gio Reyna (Dortmund, when fit). What there isn\u2019t: an obvious central striker to spearhead the 4-3-3 formation - as new Hall-of-Famer Clint Dempsey noted this week. Ricardo Pepi of Augsburg is on a 24-match scoreless streak and needs a hot start to 2022-23. Jordan Pefok (Young Boys) and West Brom\u2019s Daryl Dike didn\u2019t seize their moments. Josh Sargent (Norwich) and Gyasi Zardes (Colorado) don\u2019t seem like the answer. Though he\u2019s not a conventional target man, Jes\u00fas Ferreira of Dallas is the leading MLS goalscorer so far in 2022, with nine, and the 21-year-old may have the inside track on the starting role. Tillman has also played as a striker, while in-form 24-year-old Haji Wright, who\u2019s spent the season in the Turkish league with Antalyaspor, will get a look, though he\u2019s yet to be capped at senior level. Coach Worry rating 2.5/5 No one could accuse Gregg Berhalter of skimping on the details. If anything, he\u2019s prone to over-strategizing. During a fitful qualifying campaign which saw the US finish third behind Canada and Mexico, only avoiding an intercontinental playoff on goal difference, the immortal words of DJ Khaled sprang to mind: \u201cCongratulations, you played yourself.\u201d But context is important. Since his first game in January, 2019, Berhalter has used 88 players, a blank-slate, revolving-door, trial-and-error philosophy that has taken time to pay off as he swam through the deep pool of young American talent. In recent matches there was a sense of the fog lifting, a strong team bond forming and Berhalter developing a clearer vision of his ideal tactics and line-up; finally settling on who and how. With only a half-dozen fixtures left before the World Cup, radical revisions are not desirable or feasible, as he told The Washington Post: \u201cRight now, it\u2019s not about reinventing the wheel. It\u2019s just fine-tuning. That\u2019s all it is.\u201d Reassuring words that indicate he\u2019ll focus on filling in a couple of starting-XI gaps - center back and striker - and assessing fringe players who might be impactful off the bench. Berhalter said on Friday he has a \u201ccore group\u201d in mind but \u201caround the edges there is room\u201d. He stressed that exclusion from the June roster does not doom anyone\u2019s World Cup hopes - a relief for Pepi, who was left off, Berhalter said, to give the teenager \u201ca mental and physical break\u201d. The 48-year-old went to the 2002 and 2006 World Cups as a defender but this is only his third managerial job after spells at Hammarby and Columbus. Never mind his young team, how will the coach handle the pressure and the novelty? Ultimately, what may most dictate the Americans\u2019 prospects is out of his control: whether the elite-level stars - Pulisic, McKennie, Dest, Adams and Reyna - can stay healthy."

Samir was a sole Morocco shirt on the side of the road, negotiating a dusk-lit pavement strewn with lawless bricks that will probably be used to erect another new building before the morning. He too is searching for supporters in this sanitised land of shopping malls and motorways.  He speaks very little English and me even less Arabic, but we communicate well enough to ascertain that both his national team and mine will have some trouble advancing from their groups, and that he thinks it bizarre Qatar is basically the same size as one city, his native Casablanca (for the record, its population is smaller and geography larger). Samir is headed to Souq Waqif, a marketplace near the waterfront popular with tourists. The traditional 20th-century building, which sells spices, handicrafts, clothes and souvenirs, has been restored since I was last here in 2006. In truth, most of the city has changed, the only truly familiar landmark the spiral minaret of the Doha Islamic Centre. The nation-building exercise since that fateful December day in 2010, when the world watched in collective disbelief as this oil-rich Gulf nation was awarded World Cup hosting rights, has been a turbocharged operation in infrastructure growth with questionable long-term prospects. The roads are upgraded, the architecture grand and the green spaces spick and span. At every turn are migrant labourers \u2013 both in the flesh and in the structures they have created under a kafala system repeatedly censured by human rights organisations. Thank god Gianni Infantino understands.  Many are security guards \u2013 a Guardian report found that guards at one Doha park appear to be being paid 1330 rials ($AU547/\u00a3310) a month for 348 hours on duty. Others are diligently maintaining every patch of grass in the searing heat, while more man the squeaky-clean metro system installed for a cool 130 billion riyals ($AU53bn) and featuring driverless trains which can cruise at 100km/h. And even when they are not there, they are there. One afternoon a colleague from another news outlet tripped up on a bolt in the ground in the suburb of Al Sadd, and then noticed others evenly spaced along the sidewalk. The following day, a long line of small lamp posts had materialised as if by magic. Others are employed in absurd numbers at official accredited venues, including a main media centre as big as an international airport with travelators to boot. Accreditations are cheerfully checked, directions are thorough and guileless and food is prepared politely. If someone learns your name they often remember it. So far I have met people from Bangladesh, India, Nepal, Morocco and Kenya. Today\u2019s taxi driver is from Kerala. He has been in Doha for two months, drafted in especially for the World Cup. During our trip the car\u2019s screen pops up to an audible ping: \u201cReturn to your rank,\u201d it reads. \u201cHigh volume of passengers. Do not delay.\u201d He drops me off and buzzes away into the city of skyscrapers, some emblazoned with giant images of Robert Lewandowski and Neymar, among many others \u2013 evidence this tournament is actually happening. The fans, as it turns out, are around and can be found at the corniche, the shimmering seafront esplanade where thousands have congregated in merriment. A large proportion simply meandered, their phones capturing videos of revellers and selfies with installations reading \u201cQATAR\u201d and \u201cFIFA WORLD CUP\u201d. Others danced en masse, decked out in the colours and flags of Brazil and Argentina though with a distinctly Arab influence. A group of Tunisian supporters blew horns, a little girl with her mother in tow wearing a miniature Youssef Msakni jersey \u2013 suffice to say Australian supporters will be outnumbered at the Tunisia match. Add to the mix a lot of Bangladeshis, all having loads of fun despite not having qualified. Not a single Socceroos shirt was visible in the throng, though there is a contingent coming. The latest numbers from the Australian embassy suggest 20,000 tickets have been sold to 10,000 people. Two thousand of those are expats living in Qatar, while an unconfirmed proportion of the other 8,000 will likely have been bought by the 18,000 Australians who live in the United Arab Emirates. A few hundred are also travelling with tourism groups the Green and Gold Army and the Fanatics. Socceroos superfan Pablo Bateson will be a notable absentee. The Sydneysider has attended about 90 World Cup qualifying games since 1973 but has turned down an offer to be paid as a \u201cfan guest\u201d by Qatar\u2019s Supreme Committee for Delivery and Legacy.  Last week the Fanatics\u2019 founder, Warren Livingstone, said a few factors had played a part in a downturn of travelling supporters, including Qatar\u2019s track record on workers\u2019 and LGBTQ+ rights and the local laws and customs which will impact the fan experience. They are, of course, headlined by the strict control of alcohol consumption.  That was before the stadium beer ban. Whispers ran rampant on Friday morning that it was happening. Then came the Fifa statement, which served only to reconfirm the governing body is very much at the behest of the host country it selected. The online outrage, though \u2013 which almost shut down Twitter before Elon Musk did \u2013 was non-existent on the ground apart from those who had lobbed in just for the tournament. Visitors can still buy a beer at the official Fifa fan zone, a vast, unshaded space resembling a giant concrete car park. For those wondering, you can get one elsewhere pretty easily too, though you\u2019ll have to pay for it. Yours truly shelled out 39 riyals ($AU16) for a Corona at one venue and 48 riyals ($AU19.75) for a pint of Heineken at another. In truth it\u2019s tougher to find a decent coffee, with the price of a cappuccino hovering around 24 riyal ($AU9.85). We sit at a cafe in a shopping mall which contains an ice skating rink, a theme park complete with rollercoaster and ferris wheel, and a Venice-style canal with floating gondolas for transport. The roof throughout the complex is painted sky blue, with clouds. It is all very confusing. This is nowhere near the biggest mall in this city. But this is the stuff of a nation giddy on wealth and gifted a licence, through football, to launder its reputation on the global stage. And that is the long and short of the atmosphere at this World Cup \u2013 terrifyingly resplendent and mocked up to sterilised perfection, all to woo the world into forgetting about what it has come to represent."

                    "body": "It was a different Gianni Infantino, a more pensive Gianni Infantino, a less alarmingly excited Gianni Infantino who addressed Hall 1 at the Qatar National Convention Centre on Friday morning.\nThis had been the scene of Infantino\u2019s own defining moment just a month ago, his sacking of the temple, his Woodstock, his I have (a Very Peculiar) Dream. Brusquely late, Infantino was all business this time. \u201cI am \u2026 happy \u2026 to be here,\u201d he kicked off in a descending tone as though announcing the imminent execution of a colony of wasps. \u201cHas this World Cup been a massive success?\u201d he was asked from the floor. No, Gianni demurred very sightly. It had, in fact, been \u201can incredible success\u201d.\n\nMainly he talked numbers: 3.27 million spectators; 1.7 million in the fan zone, a billion dollars in excess profits, $11bn in projected profits for next time.\nHe talked love, he talked joy, he talked (could this be a simple misunderstanding? Does he just need to look this phrase up?) about human rights. Above all Infantino was \u201cvery, very happy\u201d at the progress of his World Cup. Put your hands together and rejoice, cheer, be thankful. Rejoice, even though your name is death.\nBecause the fact is some numbers were missing from Infantino\u2019s podium notes; some usefully vague numbers that feel as if they are now on their way to being buried in plain sight.\nThe total number of migrant worker deaths during the 12-year cycle of Qatar\u2019s World Cup has oscillated from three to 6,500, from 400 to 37. The New York Times reported just before the tournament that Nepal had calculated 2,000 deaths, including 200 suicides, a genuinely heartbreaking detail, albeit one that must, as ever, be degraded by Qatar\u2019s bizarre absence of hard data.\n\nIt has been a World Cup haunted by these ghosts, with a sense always of something just out of sight. And as Infantino ploughed on at the Convention Centre there was another spectre on stage, the outline of another oleaginous, bald Swiss on another stage, 12 years apart.\nThe fact is death and suffering were the inevitable collateral to this project from the moment Sepp Blatter read out the word \u201cQatar\u201d in that weirdly strangled upbeat tone, crowded on his own stage by glad-handing power-brokers; and feeling, perhaps, through the lineups and posed smiles, that shadow already at his back, just out of shot, scythe clanking happily.\n\nDo we have to say this again? Because what we have here is still an open case. The dots have not been joined. As Infantino drenched his audience in the familiar margarine of platitudes and half-truths, there was another sound in the hall, beneath the whirr of the cameras and the battering of keyboards. There it is, hiding in the silences: the sound of someone getting away with murder.\nAnd this story will now move on. The last days of Qatar 2022 are the end of something, final notes to a cycle that began 12 years ago, bringing with it corruption, death, criminality and a building project as large as every other World Cup combined.\nLittle wonder the eyes of the world are a little glazed by now. Qatar 2022 has become an insoluble puzzle, a place where certainties collapse like sandcastles on the tide line, where nobody is really ever responsible for anything, where words stretch and lose their meaning, like the signs on the Doha fences say \u201cAMA\u2026\u2026.zing\u201d and \u201cTO\u2026.. gether\u201d.\nInfantino says this is the best World Cup ever. Mark Pougatch says the Ghanaians are colourful. Nasser al-Khalifa says stop mixing sport and politics. A rumour spread around Doha this week that the supreme delivery committee is planning to flip the tournament motto for the final weekend, from \u201cNow is All\u201d to \u201cAll is Now\u201d, and the response was a weary shrug, a sense of, yeah, that seems about right.\n\nBut there is still time for a moment of clarity. After 12 years of staring at this process one thing is undeniably clear. In the end this is all on Fifa. We can talk about Qatari law. We can discuss the Gulf war, colonialism, the decline of the west and all the other things that are bad in the world.\nBut the fact remains Fifa had choices here. And Fifa chose death and suffering. Look back with a clear line of sight and from the moment Fifa made its bid decision there was only one route from there to here. Define corporate manslaughter. What does that crime look or feel like as a chain of events? It is another question that has not been asked enough.\nAt which point the wind chimes tinkle one last time and we\u2019re back in the drowned world of September 2010. It is worth remembering the details here. Three months before the bid vote, Fifa sent its Evaluation Committee, led by its chairman Harold Mayne-Nicholls of Chile, to assess Qatar\u2019s fitness to host a World Cup. The evaluators were in Qatar from 13 to 17 September 2010, which doesn\u2019t sound very long, even less so when a portion of it seems to have been spent playing football at the Aspire academy.\n\nThe report is fascinating. It acknowledges the extent of the work Qatar has left to do, while simultaneously averting its gaze from exactly how this is supposed to happen.\n\u201cThe accommodation plan heavily depends \u2026 on significant construction \u2026 Significant development is planned for both the New Doha International Airport and the general transport infrastructure \u2026 The considerable number of infrastructure projects and volume of temporary event-time services both imply significant human resource requirements.\u201d Are we getting anywhere yet? Is a picture emerging?\n\u201cOf the 64 accommodation solutions proposed, 54 do not yet exist \u2026 Of the 64 sites proposed 39 still need to be built. The remaining 25 sites are targeted for renovation.\u201d Fifa\u2019s committee considered stadium construction was a \u201cmedium risk\u201d, team facilities \u201chigh risk (\u201cmost of the facilities do not yet exist\u201d), with concerns too over transport infrastructure (\u201cat present very little exists\u201d). This was all duly noted by Mayne-Nicholls and fed back to his executive committee, albeit without a moment\u2019s digging into who exactly was going to build all this stuff in a tiny nation.\n\nNot that any of this was a mystery. Five minutes on Google would have done the job for Fifa\u2019s experts. As early as 2006 Human Rights Watch had published a report on kafala-type working conditions in the neighbouring emirates called Building Towers, Cheating Workers.\nIt notes the deliberately poor data on deaths and working conditions (sound familiar?). It records a Construction Week investigation that found 880 migrant workers had died in the UAE in 2004 alone, and an Indian official who registered 971 death cases in 2005 (the official total that year was 39).\nTwo years before the bid vote Amnesty International described similar poor working conditions in Qatar itself, including exploitation, non-payment of wages and lack of protection under the law. No secrets here. There is an entire library of this stuff.\nAnd yet Fifa still asked Qatar to build it a World Cup, the equivalent of handing the council digger to the town\u2019s most careless cowboy builder and promising to look the other way while he constructs a new school playground.\nIn his big opening speech Infantino described Qatar as \u201ca child\u201d who needed help. OK. That\u2019s fine. But why, Fifa, did you ask a child to build you a \u20ac220bn World Cup?\n\nAt the time Mayne-Nicholls seemed, according to the Garcia report, more interested in trying to get his son and nephew a gig at the Aspire academy. But his report was also relatively damning, and he would go on to criticise publicly the Qatar decision. Fifa responded by banning him from football for seven years on some vague-looking charges which were later overturned by a baffled court of arbitration for sport.\nThis, then, was the framework for the decision. And so the touchpaper was lit. Doha tripled in size in a decade. Workers poured into the country, drawn either by higher wages or by their own poverty depending on how you want to look at it.\nQatar recruited specifically from nations worst hit by climate change, because, hey, desperation comes cheap. It set up what the New Yorker has described as \u201can ecosystem of plausible deniability\u201d, with subcontractors upon subcontractors, a wall of silence, a lack of reporting, lack of representation, the failure even to conduct proper autopsies on its dead.\nThe reforms of the past few years suggest that Qatar has been willing to bend its rules just a little to get this thing done. And yet no pressure was exerted, no conditions applied, no comeback in 10 years when you\u2019ve moved on a bit further. Instead Fifa simply set a match under this process and turned its face away.\nIt is perhaps one reason there has been no progress on the compensation of workers. Even as Infantino was crowing over his excess profits on Friday morning Amnesty International\u2019s head of economic and social justice, Stephen Cockburn, was calling on Fifa to move, finally, on the idea of a legacy fund.\n\n\u201cGianni Infantino has announced that Fifa made $7.5bn from the 2022 World Cup cycle, more than $1bn more than expected. He also forecast Fifa to make in excess of $11bn over the next four years. Yet he offered nothing new to so many workers and their families who continue to be denied compensation for stolen wages and lost lives.\u201d\nIt has been suggested part of Fifa\u2019s reluctance to commit to this could be the fear of a potential admission of implied liability. Very few things are left to chance around here. At least, not the ones that matter.\nAnd that chain of liability really does need to be tested. Fifa, with its oversight, its European address, its teams of experts and evaluators, chose this path in full knowledge of the consequences. Fifa is a corporate person. It can be called to account. It is perhaps a surprise there hasn\u2019t yet been a more concerted attempt to do so.\nInstead other events will now swim into the foreground. As of Sunday evening a news cycle will end. The cartel of ghouls and goons that drove us here, the Blatter-Blazer-Warner golden generation, will fade deeper into the past. Nobody, will ever read the Garcia report, or care about handbags and mystery Picassos.\nThey\u2019re selling discount Messi T-shirts at the Al Sadd Lulu saver centre. The strangest decade in the history of big corporate sport is coming to an end. And as things stand the real villains of this piece are still out there, wiping the blood from their palms as they stride out centre stage to preach about love and joy and spreading the message; and doing it all still in plain sight."

                    "body": "An app providing migrant workers in Qatar with information on their rights and the possibility of legal assistance has been launched by three trade unions, the first definitive legacy for workers exploited in the process of delivering the World Cup.\nWith the month-long tournament ending on Sunday when Argentina play France in the final, the failure of Fifa and football associations to deliver positive change for workers has been decried this week by a number of charities and NGOs.\nNow the international players\u2019 union Fifpro, the Building and Wood Workers\u2019 International (BWI) and the International Domestic Workers Federation (IDWF) have taken action into their own hands by developing a digital platform to provide employment support. They call it \u201cto date the only initiative made by and for the migrant workers\u201d and say it follows consultations with as many as 1,000 individuals.\n\n\u201cAs part of a shared vision over the last few years, [we] have been seeking ways to help ensure a positive and sustainable impact for communities and people involved in the delivery of major football events,\u201d the unions said in a joint statement. \u201cAs it stands [our] call for better implementation and monitoring of recent labour reforms and the establishment of a Migrant Workers\u2019 Centre in Qatar remains unanswered.\n\u201cWith the Fifa World Cup coming to a close on 18 December, International Migrants Day, Fifpro, BWI and IDWF remain committed to supporting the advancement of migrant workers\u2019 rights and conditions. The global unions encourage collaborations from all stakeholders to ensure that the working conditions and fundamental human rights of all workers involved in and around football tournaments are respected and protected.\u201d\n\nWith workers in Qatar unable to organise their labour, and information commonly denied them by employers, there is little awareness of what rights are available to workers and how recent changes in employment law, including the abolition of the kafala system, has affected them. The app will attempt to provide users with \u201ceasy-to-understand actionable information\u201d in seven languages: English, Arabic, Urdu, Bengali, Filipino, Hindi and Nepali. It will also provide migrant community groups who speak these languages with access to training content and educational resources.\nAlthough a digital resource will not provide physical sanctuary, an idea integral to the proposal for a migrant workers\u2019 centre in Doha, the app is a rare sign of a constructive approach to dealing with the issue of legacy after the World Cup moves on from Qatar.\nThe creation of a legacy fund to remedy workers for injuries, or compensate the families of those who had died, was another key demand by the international community that has not been met. This week a group of agencies, including Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch, attacked Fifa for rolling back on what had been perceived as a commitment to such an idea.\n\u201cFifa can still do the right thing by channelling the legacy fund towards workers and their families, supporting a genuinely independent workers\u2019 centre and working with Qatar to ensure that every worker can access the compensation that they deserve,\u201d said Steve Cockburn, Amnesty International\u2019s head of economic and social justice."

                    "body": "Group A South Africa in 2010 were the only World Cup hosts to fail to make it through the group stage. Assessing the form of hosts, who have not had to play in qualifiers, is never easy but Qatar\u2019s string of heavy defeats by Portugal, Ireland and Serbia last autumn, followed by a draw against Azerbaijan raises concerns. They did, though, win the Asian Cup under their Spanish coach, F\u00e9lix S\u00e1nchez, in 2019. They will begin the tournament against Ecuador, who reached their fourth World Cup despite losing six of 18 qualifiers. The best side in the group are probably the Netherlands, after they were dragged from the roiling crisis of the past seven years by the reappointment of Louis van Gaal, who led them to third in Brazil in 2014. Aliou Ciss\u00e9\u2019s well-organised and physically imposing Senegal are the African champions despite at times struggling to score the goals their attacking talent suggests they might. Group B Semi-finalists at the last World Cup, finalists at the Euros, can England go a step further and win a tournament for the first time since 1966? Certainly they should have the squad for it and in Gareth Southgate they have a clear-sighted, sober leader who has shown how a supportive environment can be created; the doubt is whether he is quick enough to react tactically when games begin to slip away from his side. The USA may be one of the less threatening of the second pot of seeds, but England have failed to beat them in two previous World Cup meetings. Iran add an element of political intrigue, and beat the USA in 1998. Their Croatian coach, Dragan Skocic, has made them solid rather than spectacular, 10 games in the third qualifying phase yielding only 15 goals for and four against. Scotland, Wales or Ukraine will make up the group after they conclude their delayed playoff. Group C The days when Lionel Messi underperformed for his country while winning everything with his club are long gone. Since inspiring Argentina to the Copa Am\u00e9rica last year he has become a player far more effective at international level. Having ended Argentina\u2019s 28-year trophy drought, could he cap a magnificent career with a World Cup? Lionel Scaloni\u2019s side might lack the star quality of some previous Argentina squads but they look much better balanced.  Argentina will come up against a former manager in Gerardo Martino, whose experienced Mexico found qualification something of a slog with only two points taken from the four games against the USA and Canada. Poland\u2019s playoff win over Sweden suggested they are rather more than just Robert Lewandowski plus 10 others. Saudi Arabia are grimly consistent under Herv\u00e9 Renard, the only coach ever to win the Africa Cup of Nations with two different countries. They conceded a single goal in their 10 third-phase group games. Group D No nation has anything approaching the depth of the world champions. The question with France really is over the wilful dourness of their coach, Didier Deschamps. It\u2019s easy, of course, for outsiders to appeal for greater entertainment and to wonder whether a crop of players this gifted might not be producing more memorable football, but the performance at the last Euros suggested that Deschamps\u2019s caution may be counterproductive. Jalel Kadri replaced Mondher Kebaier as Tunisia coach after the Cup of Nations and plenty of his squad have experience of playing in France. The bigger threat to France will come from Denmark, who won nine of their 10 qualifiers and have developed into a progressive and well-organised side with a ferocious team spirit forged in part in the aftermath of Christian Eriksen\u2019s collapse in their first game at Euro 2020. The group will be completed by the UAE, Australia or Peru. Group E There\u2019s no doubting the most immediately attractive tie of the group stage: the clash of the 2010 and 2014 champions as Spain face Germany. After two dismal World Cup performances in a row, there is a sense that Spain are building again under Luis Enrique as he has introduced a more direct style. For Germany, the last World Cup was a major embarrassment, defeat to South Korea resulting in a first round exit for the first time in 80 years. Joachim L\u00f6w, who had struggled to rejuvenate his squad, probably should have left then, but hung around for a disappointing Euros. Since he has been replaced by Hansi Flick, though, Germany have excelled. Japan, who have a wealth of European experience in their squad, can feel a little unfortunate at yet another tough draw in their seventh successive World Cup appearance. The group is rounded off by the winner of the Costa Rica v New Zealand playoff. Group F The golden generation is looking rather old now, but Belgium still qualified undefeated from their group. The biggest doubts are at the back, where Jan Vertonghen and Toby Alderweireld will have a combined age of 69 by the time the World Cup begins. Morocco are the fourth side Vahid Halilhodzic has led to the World Cup finals, but this might be the third time the famously difficult coach has lost his job before getting to the finals.  Although Morocco had looked perhaps the best attacking side in the group stage at the Cup of Nations, he is feuding with Hakim Ziyech and is wildly unpopular. Croatia benefited from a relatively straightforward qualifying group, but the runners-up of four years ago remain dangerous so long as Luka Modric defies age. Canada\u2019s only previous appearance came in 1986, but this squad is an entirely different level, led by Alphonso Davies of Bayern Munich and Jonathan David of Lille. Group G It is 20 years since Brazil were the last non-European winner of a World Cup and again they are one of perhaps two non-European sides who might realistically be considered capable of success. Passing unbeaten through Conmebol qualifying is a remarkable achievement and Tite is an impressive coach, but the last World Cup and the quarter-final exit against Belgium was a reminder of the dangers of depending too much on Neymar. The group is perhaps best described as awkward rather than intimidating. Switzerland, now under Murat Yakin, are solid but over-reliant on Breel Embolo, while Dragan Stojkovic\u2019s Serbia have attacking talent in Dusan Tadic, Aleksandar Mitrovic and Luka Jovic, but kept just one clean sheet in their eight qualifiers. Cameroon rather scrambled through, thanks to the ancient magic that means they can never lose to Algeria, and Rigobert Song\u2019s side lean heavily on the goals of Vincent Aboubakar. Group H This is perhaps the hardest group to call. It feels as if there are more questions than answers about Portugal who, despite finishing behind Serbia in the group, qualified comfortably enough, beating Turkey and North Macedonia in the playoffs. But there are doubts over Fernando Santos\u2019s cautious tactics and the best permutation of their array of attacking talent. Uruguay are resurgent, having won all four qualifiers since Diego Alonso replaced \u00d3scar Tab\u00e1rez, whose 15-year reign as coach eventually ran out of steam last year. South Korea qualified convincingly under the former Portugal coach Paulo Bento, winning seven and drawing two of 10 third-phase qualifiers. Ghana were desperately poor at the Cup of Nations and topped their qualifying group thanks only to a highly debatable penalty against South Africa before beating Nigeria in their playoff on away goals. But the arrival of Otto Addo, initially as interim coach, brought calmness and resolve even in the cauldron of Abuja."

                    "body": "In 2013, after the announcement in 2010 that the tiny but enormously wealthy Gulf state of Qatar would host the Fifa 2022 Football World Cup, the Nepal-based Guardian journalist Pete Pattisson made the first of many trips to Kathmandu\u2019s airport in Nepal to count coffins. For months, Pattisson traced the bodies of dozens of migrant workers repatriated from Qatar back to their families to try to establish why they never made it home alive. It was the start of 10 years of reporting by the Guardian into the sometimes brutal conditions faced by hundreds of thousands of migrant workers tasked with building Qatar\u2019s state-of-the-art stadiums, and the roads, hotels and infrastructure needed to host one of the biggest sporting events on Earth. With just days to go to first kick-off, we look back at how migrant rights became centre stage in arguably the most controversial World Cup in the history of the tournament. September 2013 Revealed: Qatar\u2019s World Cup \u2018slaves\u2019  The Guardian publishes a comprehensive investigation into worker deaths and abuse in Qatar, which finds that dozens of workers had died and others were suffering appalling labour abuses, which in some case could amount to forced labour, a form of modern slavery, as defined by the International Labour Organization (ILO). Workers were being forced to live in unsanitary and overcrowded accommodation and some said that they were not being paid and were unable to leave and return home. In response, the Qatari labour ministry says it has strict rules governing working in the heat, the provision of labour and the prompt payment of salaries. The Supreme Committee, the body tasked with organising the World Cup, told the Guardian it was \u201cdeeply concerned\u201d with the allegations and had been told the government authorities were conducting an investigation September 2013Qatar under pressure over migrant labour abuse The Guardian reports that Qatar is facing growing international pressure to act against the rising death toll of migrant workers preparing for the 2022 World Cup, as unions warned another 4,000 people could die in the Gulf emirate before a ball is kicked. Fifa calls for an urgent enquiry and says \u201cvery concerned about the reports presented by the media regarding labour rights\u2019 abuses and the conditions for construction workers\u201d. A spokesman for Qatar\u2019s World Cup organisers says they are \u201cappalled\u201d by the Guardian revelations and there is \u201cno excuse\u201d for the maltreatment of workers.  May 2014Qatar promises to reform labour laws after outcry over \u2018World Cup slaves\u2019 After the Guardian\u2019s 2013 investigation, Qatari officials commit to sweeping labour reforms, including replacing the country\u2019s kafala sponsorship system, which tethers workers to a single employer and prevents them from leaving their job or the country without permission. July 2014 Trapped in Qatar: the migrants who helped build the \u2018tower of football\u2019  As construction on the World Cup stadiums begins, the Guardian returns to the Qatar capital, Doha, and reports that workers assigned to build the \u201cAspire\u201d football complex \u2013 housing the headquarters of the Supreme Committee for Delivery and Legacy \u2013 claim they were not paid for months. In response to the allegations, Qatar\u2019s 2022 World Cup organising committee says it is \u201cheavily dismayed\u201d to hear of the allegations and \u201cwill continue to press for a speedy and fair conclusion to all cases\u201d. July 2014 Qatar World Cup stadium workers earn as little as 45p an hour  A follow-up investigation finds that migrant workers building the first stadium for Qatar\u2019s 2022 World Cup say they had been earning as little as 45p an hour. The pay rate appeared to be in breach of the tournament organisers\u2019 own worker welfare rules and despite the Gulf kingdom spending \u00a3134bn on infrastructure in the lead-up to the competition. November 2014Qatar\u2019s ambitious future driven on by North Korean \u2018forced labour\u2019 The Guardian finds North Korean labourers working on large construction projects in conditions that may amount to forced labour. The investigation suggests the workers may receive as little as 10% of their salary during the three years they typically work in Qatar, with the remainder expropriated by a chain of North Korean state-run bodies, overseen by Office 39, a department that reportedly controls a fund to bankroll Kim Jong-un\u2019s lifestyle. The Qatari authorities say that there are 2,800 North Korean guest workers registered in Qatar and they have no recorded complaints about their payment or treatment. \u201cQatar is determined to continually improve labour conditions for all who work in the country, and will continue to work with NGOs, businesses and other governments to achieve this,\u201d it says in a statement.  April 2016 Balfour Beatty and Interserve accused of migrant worker labour abuses in Qatar The Guardian reveals claims of labour abuses among subsidiaries of leading British construction firms. Alleged abuses include erratic or reduced payment of wages, passport confiscation, workers entering employment with high levels of debt bondage and pay levels below those agreed when workers were recruited in their home countries. The workers spoke of a culture of fear and intimidation, with threats of arrest or deportation. Both companies say they are working within the parameters of Qatari law and rigorously monitor their labour supply companies to ensure good practice. November 2018\u00a340 a week to build the World Cup stadiums  The Guardian finds World Cup stadium workers being paid \u00a35 a day \u2013 a \u00a3650 a month basic salary for eight hours of work a day, six days a week. The investigation also uncovered the plight of those who say they had paid agents for visas, but whose jobs and sponsors proved to be a mirage. The supreme committee says its contractors had been instructed to pay the advisory minimum wage and after an investigation, any problems with payment had been rectified. October 2019Revealed: hundreds of migrant workers dying of heat stress in Qatar each year Despite bid committee chief executive Hassan Al-Thawadi saying in 2010 that \u201cheat is not and will not be an issue\u201d, the Guardian reveals that hundreds of thousands of migrant workers toiled in temperatures of up to 45C for up to 10 hours a day, potentially leading to the deaths of hundreds of workers. An analysis of weather conditions finds that it is unsafe to work outside at all in Qatar. A government spokesperson acknowledges that heat stress was challenging but says the government has introduced legislation to protect workers, as well as new national heat stress guidance.  August 2020 Qatar has failed to explain up to 70% of migrant worker deaths in past 10 years \u2013 Amnesty  The human rights organisation says the majority of migrant worker deaths in Qatar are attributed to \u201cnatural causes\u201d, cardiac or respiratory failure; classifications which are \u201cmeaningless\u201d without the underlying cause of death explained, according to one expert cited. Amnesty says intense heat and humidity exposure is likely to be a significant factor and has urged the Qatari authorities to put in place better protections for workers. A government spokesperson says: \u201cQatar remains steadfast in its commitment to labour reform and will not be thrown off course by any organisation that seeks to discredit the progress we have made.\u201d September 2020New labour law ends Qatar\u2019s exploitative kafala system Qatar finally launches sweeping reforms to its labour laws, ending kafala and introducing a \u201cnon-discriminatory minimum wage\u201d, the first in the Middle East. The reforms are widely lauded by the ILO and cautiously welcomed by human rights groups. February 2021Revealed: 6,500 migrant workers have died in Qatar since World Cup awarded  A multi-country investigation by the Guardian finds at least 6,500 workers from south Asia have died in Qatar in the 10 years since it was awarded the right to host the World Cup. The findings expose Qatar\u2019s failure to protect its 2 million-strong migrant workforce, or even investigate the causes of the apparently high death rate among the largely young workers. The Qatar government says that the number of deaths \u2013 which it does not dispute \u2013 is proportionate to the size of the migrant workforce and that the figures include white-collar workers who have died naturally after living in Qatar for many years. It also says that only 20% of migrants from the countries in question are employed in construction, and that work-related deaths in this sector accounted for fewer than 10% of fatalities within this group. November 2021\u2018We have fallen into a trap\u2019: Qatar\u2019s World Cup dream is a nightmare for hotel staff  A year before the first match is due to be played, the Guardian exposes allegations of abusive working conditions in hotels included in Fifa\u2019s hospitality packages. A Qatari official said Qatar had a zero-tolerance approach towards violating companies, issuing harsh penalties that included fines and prison sentences. March 2022Revealed: migrant workers in Qatar forced to pay billions in recruitment fees We reveal how low-wage migrant workers have been forced to pay billions of dollars in recruitment fees to secure their jobs in World Cup host nation Qatar over the past decade. The Qatar government says companies involved in illegal recruitment practices have been severely punished and that 24 recruitment agencies were shut down and had their licences revoked for breaking Qatar\u2019s laws. April 2022\u2018No one should suffer like me\u2019: families of Qatar\u2019s dead migrant workers left with nothing  The Guardian travels across the southern plains of Nepal to investigate how families of workers who died in Qatar are left in debt and without compensation after a failure to investigate deaths. A spokesperson for the Qatar government says that companies in Qatar are legally required to compensate the families of all workers who lose their lives in a work-related incident. The supreme committee organising the World Cup in Qatar says in a statement that its commitment to the, \u201chealth, safety and dignity of all workers employed on our projects has remained steadfast and unwavering.\u201d September 2022Migrant workers in Qatar left in debt after being ordered home before World Cup starts With only months to go before the start of the tournament, the Guardian\u2019s Pete Pattisson travels again to Qatar to report on how migrant workers say they are being ordered home before the World Cup starts, leaving them in debt and without work. In a statement, a Qatari official says there is no government requirement for companies to repatriate employees or reduce their workforce before the World Cup. November 2022Security guards at Doha World Cup park claim they are paid just 35p an hour On the eve of the tournament, security guards at the heart of World Cup festivities claim they are paid just 35p an hour, appear to only get one day off a month and are housed in dirty camps on the edge of the desert. In response, the Qatari government says that extensive action has been taken to combat exploitative labour practices and when violations are recorded, corrective action is taken and offending companies penalised. The Al Nasr Star Group, which employs the security guards, confirms the guards work 12-hour shifts but say they get two hours\u2019 break each day and one day off a week."

                    "body": "Multiple sponsors have raised concerns or issues with Fifa about their contracts at the Qatar World Cup, the Guardian can reveal. It gives football\u2019s governing body another headache hours after it was forced to ban alcohol from stadiums by the Qatari authorities, a decision that complicated its $75m (\u00a363m) contract with the brewer of Budweiser, Anheuser-Busch InBev.\nOne representative of another major sponsor, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that many partners had felt \u201clet down by Fifa in lots of ways\u201d. They also indicated there had been informal discussions about potential contractual breaches and reneging on deliverables.\n\u201cEveryone has a gripe in some way or form,\u201d they added. \u201cThere is a lot of \u2018regrouping\u2019 going [on] to understand what the options are contractually speaking.\u201d\n\nEarlier Fifa confirmed in a terse statement that alcohol would not be sold inside or around the perimeter of World Cup stadiums.\n\u201cFollowing discussions between host country authorities and Fifa, a decision has been made to focus the sale of alcoholic beverages on the Fifa Fan Festival, other fan destinations and licensed venues, removing sales points of beer from Qatar\u2019s World Cup 2022 stadium perimeters,\u201d it said.\n\u201cThere is no impact to the sale of Bud Zero, which will remain available at all Qatar\u2019s World Cup stadiums.\u201d\nHowever it will now be looking nervously over its shoulders at the prospect of legal action from Budweiser, unless some sort of compensation can be agreed with Qatar.\nShortly before the announcement the US beer brand sent a tweet \u2013 since deleted \u2013 that said: \u201cWell, this is awkward\u2026\u201d\n\nThe sale of alcohol is strictly controlled in Qatar, a conservative Muslim nation, but organisers had promised it would be available in match venues and fan zones \u2013 and would be reasonably priced.\nHowever it has now decided that alcohol will be available at matches only in hospitality boxes, where the cheapest suites are nearly \u00a320,000 a match, and in some fan zones after 7pm, where it will cost nearly \u00a312 for 500ml of Budweiser.\nAccording to the New York Times, staff members were told the move had followed security advice but that the change had originated with Sheikh Jassim bin Hamad bin Khalifa al-Thani \u2013 the brother of Qatar\u2019s ruling emir and the royal most active in the day-to-day planning of the tournament.\nThe Guardian also understands another consideration was wanting to make sure the large number of supporters from Gulf and Asian countries, where drinking alcohol is not part of the culture, felt comfortable.\n\nUntil recently organisers had always said that they would find a way to find a middle ground between western fans\u2019 tastes and Qatar\u2019s conservative culture. That message was reiterated most recently by Fatma al-Nuaimi, head of communications for the Supreme Committee, who said: \u201cWhen it comes to alcohol, hospitality is part of our culture, even if alcohol is not. So it will be in the places where the fans will gather, but not openly on the streets.\u201d\nThe organisation\u2019s official fan guide also states that \u201cticket holders will have access to Budweiser, Budweiser Zero, and Coca-Cola products within the stadium perimeter\u201d for at least three hours before games, and for one hour afterwards.\nThe news was greeted with frustration by the Football Supporters\u2019 Association, which questioned whether the Qataris could now be trusted on their other promises.\n\u201cSome fans like a beer at a match and some don\u2019t, but the real issue is the last minute U-turn which speaks to a wider problem \u2013 the total lack of communication and clarity from the organising committee towards supporters,\u201d a spokesperson said.\n\u201cIf they can change their minds on this at a moment\u2019s notice, with no explanation, supporters will have understandable concerns about whether they will fulfil other promises relating to accommodation, transport or cultural issues.\u201d"

                    "body": "As Hope* arrived to start her cleaning shift, her eyes anxiously scanned the room. If she spotted him, her heart sank. She might spend the next eight hours dodging his requests for a date, for a kiss, for more than that. Over an 18-month period from mid-2020, Hope\u2019s male supervisor at the hotel in Qatar where she was employed repeatedly sexually propositioned her, she says. When she refused his advances, he gave her extra housekeeping work for no additional pay. \u201cI was feeling low,\u201d she says on the phone from her home in Kenya, where she returned at the start of this year after her contract in Qatar came to an end. \u201cBecause when someone tells you such things, you ask yourself: \u2018why is he taking advantage of you?\u2019\u201d The plight of the tens of thousands of men who travelled thousands of miles to help build Qatar\u2019s World Cup dream and the exploitation that many faced has been widely documented. Yet rights groups say the problems facing migrant women have not been explored or scrutinised in the same way, and their voices have been largely absent from the debate on migrant workers\u2019 rights in the lead up to the tournament. Women working in the global hospitality industry are particularly vulnerable to sexual harassment and gender based violence. A survey by the Unite union found that over half of respondents had directly experienced sexual harassment and assault in their workplaces.  The Guardian and the Fuller Project spoke with five women, including Hope, employed at different hotels in Qatar between 2017 and 2022 about their experiences. They detailed allegations of sexual harassment and physical and verbal abuse. Most of these hotels are among more than 100  now endorsed by Fifa, football\u2019s governing body and the tournament organiser. The testimonies of women interviewed for this piece, as well as those of experts who have worked extensively with female hospitality workers in Qatar, suggest few feel able to report sexual harassment should it occur. \u201cThere\u2019s been so much focus on [men working in] construction and the stadiums, as they are central to the tournament,\u201d says Isobel Archer, Gulf programme manager at the Business and Human Rights Resource Centre, a non-profit that has researched working conditions in Qatar\u2019s hotels. \u201cBut [sexual harassment] is absolutely happening in hotels.\u201d Although men dominate the country\u2019s migrant workforce, government data shows nearly 300,000 migrant women worked in Qatar as of June this year. In 2020, female migrants made up just over a fifth of hotel workers, according to the most recent government statistics, although this is probably a significant undercount as the figures exclude subcontracted workers, say rights groups. To cope with the influx of 1.3 million football fans, an additional 108 hotels were built ahead of the start of the tournament. Archer says that high-profile sporting events are linked to a rise in violence against women, further increasing the risks facing women hotel workers and anticipates the same happening during the World Cup. She says that urgent action has to be taken by hotels, which will be packed to capacity with football fans, to protect women and allow them to be able to report abuse safely without fear of repercussions. \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019ve seen any evidence that hotels are doing anything, frankly, [to support women],\u201d she says. \u201cAnd [the women] simply won\u2019t be able to speak up.\u201d Qatar representatives said the five women\u2019s stories were extreme cases which were not the reality for millions of female workers. Fifa said it took any allegations of misconduct extremely seriously and had a clear process in place for anyone who wanted to report any such incidents.  While women hotel workers across the world face a disproportionate risk of gender based violence compared to other industries, rights groups say that those working in Qatar could find it particularly difficult to report the abuse they may face. A report published this year by Equidem, a labour rights organisation, said gender-based violence and harassment are \u201ca fact of life for women\u201d at some Fifa World Cup hotel partners. Equidem\u2019s researchers contacted more than 800 migrant workers across the region, male and female, but only 10% agreed to have their experiences recorded. Some women, like Hope, dread deportation. Others might have paid illegal and exorbitant recruitment fees, forcing them to stay in jobs with abusive conditions. Despite sweeping labour reforms in 2019, with migrants now allowed to change jobs or leave the country without an employer\u2019s permission, workers say little has changed. Employers still have a huge degree of control over employees\u2019 lives and with migrant worker unions banned, there are few routes to effectively raise grievances. Migrant women who come to Qatar, mostly from Africa and Asia, are often the main breadwinner for their families. Many are reluctant to speak out because they fear losing those jobs, says Ann Abunda, founder of Sandigan, a Kuwait-based domestic worker organisation. When she asked her network to inquire about issues of harassment in Qatar\u2019s hotels, more than a dozen women replied, either directly via social media or through her contacts in Qatar. Women told her there was no point in reporting harassment because employers would not act and were angered by the complaint. \u201c[Women] just don\u2019t want to talk [publicly] about that,\u201d says Abunda. \u201cBut they are saying it\u2019s rampant.\u201d The country\u2019s penal code also criminalises sex outside marriage. Police often do not believe women who report sexual violence, instead siding with men who claim it was consensual, which can lead to the survivor facing charges, says Rothna Begum, a senior women\u2019s rights researcher at Human Rights Watch. Facing further barriers, all women in Qatar need to show they are married in order to access certain forms of sexual and reproductive healthcare, adds Begum. This can include treatment for sexually transmitted infections, HIV and pregnancy. In an attempt to tackle violations, Qatar\u2019s supreme committee has been auditing hotel working conditions, and an online platform for worker complaints was launched last year. Yet rights groups say audits often do not detect serious abuse as they only provide a snapshot of the situation and rely on input from workers. Women are also reluctant to report issues as sensitive as harassment. \u201cAre you really going to disclose a violation against your body to a complete stranger during a corporate audit?\u201d says Archer. \u201cIt\u2019s just a very unlikely scenario.\u201d The Qatari government has said it will intensify labour inspections during the tournament, including extra health and safety checks. Mustafa Qadri, the executive director of Equidem, believes the increased scrutiny over the next month will ensure a degree of protection for workers. Yet fundamental structural problems such as migrant workers being unable to organise and their lack of freedoms won\u2019t have been adequately addressed once the world\u2019s attention moves on, he says. Hotels are not creating an environment for workers to speak up, says Archer. Risk assessments need to be conducted in order to understand who their female migrant workers are and what might make them more susceptible to gender-based violence, she says. Management needs to be trained to spot signs of harassment and to communicate effectively with the entire workforce, particularly subcontracted female employees, who are often at higher risk. Hotels also need to be clear on the reporting process and next steps in terms of safeguarding as well as psychosocial and medical support.  There are reports that restrictions on consensual sex and women\u2019s access to reproductive services may be relaxed during the World Cup. Should this happen, says Begum, the Qatari authorities need to ensure it applies to all women, not just fans, inform all women about the changes and ensure they continue beyond the tournament. In response to the claims of harassment, Fifa said it was steadfast in its commitment to ensuring respect for internationally recognised human rights and takes allegations of misconduct seriously. The body also said it has a number of measures and reporting mechanisms in place for anyone wishing to make a complaint, including a workers\u2019 welfare hotline. It added that it was implementing an \u201cunprecedented due diligence process in relation to the protection of workers involved in the Fifa World Cup Qatar 2022, in line with Fifa\u2019s responsibility under the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights.\u201d A Qatari official said anyone who came forward with a complaint would be supported and their complaint fully investigated: \u201cQatari law prioritises the safety and wellbeing of all women. Assault is criminalised under the penal code, and access to justice is a guaranteed right for everyone through the Qatari court system. Female foreign residents play an important role in Qatar\u2019s economy and society, and we do not tolerate any infringement to the fundamental human rights of women or anyone in our country. As in all countries around the world, unfortunate, extreme cases do occur and unscrupulous employers are a reality. But these extreme cases are not representative of the reality of life for the millions of foreign female residents who have lived in Qatar in recent decades. Protecting the rights of all women in Qatar \u2013 including female workers \u2013 is and will continue to be at the forefront of our priorities and vision.\u201d  The cleaner\u2019s story Sally* was just trying to do her job. Her hotel cleaning shift was nearly over, tiredness was setting in, and the dirty sheets weren\u2019t going to wash themselves. But the male guest asked for a kiss, she says. When she reported the incident to her supervisor, the reply was essentially: \u201cYou\u2019re a woman, learn to handle your issues.\u201d What she experienced at the luxury hotel still affects her, says Sally. \u201cI don\u2019t like getting close to strange men because you never know their intentions. It brings back the memory,\u201d she says from her home in Kenya, her voice tearful. \u201cI never want to go back.\u201d Management often took little action or sided with guests when female workers complained about harassment, say several. Instead of dealing with harassment allegations directly, one cleaner describes a policy of swapping staff members in and out when guests behave inappropriately.  Once, when a guest tried to slap her, she alleges her supervisor responded by saying she shouldn\u2019t have been serving him in the first place. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit disheartening,\u201d she says. \u201cBesides sexual harassment, maybe a guest is mishandling you or being rude. All these things you report but nothing [is done]. So you just have to deal with it. It made me feel very small. And vulnerable. At the end of the day, \u2018the guest is always right\u2019.\u201d For Sally, her friends at the hotel were quite literally her lifeline. When they heard her arguing with the male guest who asked for a kiss, they rushed in to help, she says. Six months later, they burst in again when they heard her say: \u201cDon\u2019t get any closer.\u201d This time, a senior supervisor snapped into action. The guest reportedly sent his apologies, though Sally wasn\u2019t sure if this was true as he never said anything directly to her. Concerned about other women being sent to clean his room, she wanted the guest\u2019s stay terminated. \u201cBut they didn\u2019t do that,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s not a privilege for them to have you. It\u2019s a privilege for them to have guests.\u201d * Names have been changed or omitted to protect identities  This story was co-published with The Fuller Project "

This will continue until the end of the World Cup. I am very happy to see you, Mr President.

But one area in which Qatar has followed Russia\u2019s example is by requiring fans to sign up for a mandatory ID, known as a Hayya card, to enter the country and World Cup stadiums.\nMeanwhile Khater, asked about the armbands in an interview with Sky News, said he had read about them in the press but did not know anything official. \u201cThis is a sporting tournament that people want to come and enjoy,\u201d the chief executive of the Supreme Committee for Delivery and Legacy said.\n\u201cTurning it into a platform of political statements, I don\u2019t think is right for the sport.\u201d\n\nIn response to Khater\u2019s interview, James Cleverly, the foreign secretary, said he would \u201cabsolutely support\u201d Kane and the Football Association\u2019s stance on the armband. Fifa is yet to give its approval to the armband but it is understood England intend to use it regardless.\nIt has previously been confirmed that rainbow flags will be allowed Qatar, and Nasser also made clear that gay fans would be able to hold hands in public.\n\u201cAt the end of the day, as long as you don\u2019t do anything that harms other people, if you\u2019re not destroying public property, as long as you\u2019re behaving in a way that\u2019s not harmful, then everybody\u2019s welcome and you have nothing to worry about,\u201d he said.\nKhater was asked whether he felt criticism levelled at Qatar had been racist and replied: \u201cI\u2019m not going to get into what the intentions of other people are. I\u2019m not going to get into the minds and souls of other people. But, you know, who knows? Possibly.\u201d"

When the USMNT started to qualify for the World Cup on a regular basis in the 1990s, US internationals \u2013 and goalkeepers in particular \u2013 became a regular sight in European football. But John Harkes, Tony Meola (remember his spells at Brighton and Watford? Nope, nor did we), Paul Caligiuri, Kasey Keller and the rest weren\u2019t the first wave of American footballers to cross the pond. Niche nerds across the globe owe thanks to Tim Dockery, who has sent a list of some of the earliest Americans to have appeared in the major European leagues: Italy: Alfio Argentieri was born in New York, but raised in Italy. He played for Lazio in the 1936-37 season. Alfonso Negro was born in Brooklyn, but mostly raised in Italy. In addition to winning Olympic gold in 1936 with the Italian national team, he played for Fiorentina from 1934-38 and Napoli in 1938. England: Jim Brown was a Scotsman who became a naturalised US citizen in the mid-1930s, a few years after he represented the US at the 1930 World Cup. He played for Manchester United (1932-34) and Tottenham (1936-37). Alexander Wood was another Scotsman who became a naturalised US citizen after moving to America at 14. He also represented them at the 1930 World Cup (he was eligible by virtue of his father\u2019s citizenship) and played for Leicester City (1933-36) and Nottingham Forest (1936-37). Germany: Andy Mate, Hungarian-born, won one cap. In addition to playing the New York Cosmos\u2019 first ever game, he scored two goals during his brief stint with Hamburg in the 1964-65 season.  France: Joe Gaetjens, after famously scoring the only goal against England in the 1950 World Cup match, he went off to play four games for Racing Club de Paris (then in Ligue 1), where he scored twice. Spain: Kasey Keller seems too recent to be the first American to play professionally in Spain, but AS says his 1999-2000 season with Rayo Vallecano was the debut of an American in La Liga.  It looks like AS are right. Peter Vermes and Tab Ramos played in Spain earlier in the 1990s, both for Figueres and also for Real Betis in Ramos\u2019s case, but their teams weren\u2019t in the Primera Divis\u00edon at the time. Ramos would almost certainly have been the first American to play in La Liga were it not for one of the World Cup\u2019s most infamous assaults. Betis were promoted in 1993-94, but the Brazil left-back Leonardo fractured Ramos\u2019s skull with a vicious elbow at USA 94, which meant Ramos was unavailable when Betis returned to La Liga. In January 1995, he became the first player to sign up for the all-new Major League Soccer. We did find one other France-based player of note: John Donoghue, an American-born defender who played for Celtic, also had a spell with Excelsior Roubaix from 1932-35. They might not count as a major club \u2013 they don\u2019t exist anymore \u2013 but at the time they regularly finished in the top half of the French top flight, and they won the Coupe de France in Donoghue\u2019s first season. And Celtic are definitely a major club.  Before Donoghue and the rest, there was the tragic story of Eddy Hamel, who was born in New York to Jewish immigrants from the Netherlands in 1902. His family moved back to Amsterdam when he was a teenager. \u201cEddy, a talented right winger, joined Ajax in 1922 and became the first Jewish player and the first American to represent the club,\u201d writes Adi Zalmanowicz. \u201cDuring his eight years at Ajax he became a fan favourite, appearing in 125 games and scoring eight goals. \u201cAfter the Nazis occupied the Netherlands during the second world war, Hamel was arrested despite his American citizenship \u2013 because he was a Jew. He was sent to Auschwitz-Birkenau in late-1942, and after a few months of hard labour and torture, he was murdered in the gas chambers on 30 April 1943. He was 40 years old.\u201d There is a chapter devoted to Hamel in Simon Kuper\u2019s fine book Ajax, The Dutch, The War, which includes this memory from an elderly supporter:  Tall boy, black hair combed back. Not a product of the Jewish Quarter. He was what you might call an idol. Eddy Hamel, I can still see him before me. Quick, and he had a very good cross. Something like David Beckham now. Ach, it was all different then. The speed of Eddy Hamel is a snail\u2019s pace now.   Hamel seems to be the first American to play for one of modern football\u2019s major clubs, but Chris Matterface has an interesting story from the 19th century: \u201cIt obviously depends on how you define a \u2018major European team\u2019, but in the far-off days of the 1870s, the winners of the FA Cup would probably count by default given that so little football was being played outside the UK.  \u201cBoston-born Julian Sturgis was on the winning team for Wanderers against Oxford University in the 1873 FA Cup final. In 2004, many sources claimed that Tim Howard had become the first American to win the FA Cup when he helped Manchester United beat Millwall, but they were sadly incorrect.\u201d Which is a shame, because had they mentioned Sturgis, they would have been obliged to tell some of his extraordinary life story: Etonian, rower, barrister, novelist, poet, librettist, lyricist \u2013 and, quite possibly, the first American to play for a major European team. (NB: the globalisation of women\u2019s football occurred much later, but we think the first USWNT players to play for a major European side were Ali Krieger and Gina Lewandowski. They joined FFC Frankfurt in 2007 and won the Uefa Women\u2019s Cup \u2013 now the Champions League \u2013 in their first season.) Tight at the bottom \u201cAt the halfway stage of the Premier League season, the bottom seven clubs are separated by only two points. Has there ever been such a tight relegation battle in the Premier League?\u201d asks William Bailey. As William says, there are only two points separating Leeds in 14th (though they have a game in hand) and Southampton in 20th. That\u2019s smaller than the three-point gap between Leeds and Nottingham Forest in 13th. Often by this stage, at least one team has been cut adrift at the bottom. At the halfway stage of the 2020-21 season, for example, there were a whopping 17 points between bottom club Sheffield United and 14th-placed Wolves. That\u2019s the biggest gap in English top-flight history, never mind the Premier League era.  In lieu of a life, we\u2019ve been through every English season since the change to three points for a win in 1981-82. In 17 of the 42 seasons, the bottom seven were separated by at least 10 points at the halfway stage. And it has never been as tight at the bottom. The snuggest relegation scraps before this season were in 1986-87, 2010-11 and 2013-14, when the bottom seven were separated by five points. A couple of notes. In 2010-11, the entire bottom half \u2013 including Liverpool, who had struggled under Roy Hodgson, and Everton \u2013 were separated by those five points. And in 1986-87, the teams in the bottom seven included today\u2019s superpowers Chelsea, Newcastle and Manchester City. Manchester United had only just clambered out of that group. City were eventually relegated along with Leicester and Aston Villa. There were, for obvious reasons, some tighter tables in the era of two points for a win. But, while we\u2019d be loath to swear to this under oath, we think that even between 1888 and 1981 there was only a single example of the bottom seven being separated by two points or fewer at the halfway stage of the season. That was in 1910-11, when 20th-placed Woolwich Arsenal were only two points behind Spurs in 14th. This vague precedent gives hope to Southampton and the rest of this season\u2019s strugglers. Woolwich Arsenal and The Wednesday, the teams in the two relegation places at the halfway stage, finished in 10th and sixth, respectively. Knowledge archive \u201cDid the great and the good of football officialdom (OK, Sepp Blatter) actually ever play the game professionally?\u201d asked Andy Burrows in 2007. Not professionally, but football\u2019s then-biggest cheese did play as a striker at an amateur level for a number of years in Switzerland. Indeed, according to Fifa\u2019s official website, Blatter\u2019s career spanned a whopping 23 years from 1948 (this is presumably including youth football as he would have been 12 at that time) to 1971 \u2013 most, if not all of which, was spent with hometown side FC Visp.  \u201cI scored a lot of goals,\u201d boasted Blatter to interviewers from CNN as they filmed a documentary about him in 2006. \u201cThat\u2019s not a false modesty \u2013 it\u2019s really true, especially at the youth level.\u201d We\u2019d be inclined not to believe him about this, or the story about splitting a pair of boots (\u201cI took the left, he took the right\u201d) with a friend for his first ever game, but since he did own up to diving (\u201cI was not a perfect player, I have to say, being a striker\u201d) and having a go at referees during his playing days in the same interview, we\u2019re prepared to give him the benefit of the doubt.  Can you help? \u201cTransfer announcement videos are everywhere these days \u2013 even Romeo Beckham had one when he joined Brentford\u2019s reserve team. But who was the first player to appear in one?\u201d asks Colin Apps. \u201cShakira\u2019s epic takedown of her ex, Gerard Piqu\u00e9, has been a smash hit worldwide (certainly, in terms of YouTube views),\u201d writes Rashaad Jorden. \u201cSo I wonder \u2026 has any other footballer been the subject of a diss track?\u201d  \u201cHas anyone ever missed two penalties in the same shootout?\u201d wonders James Pollard. \u201cA goalscorer joyfully taking off their shirt has been banned since 2004, when Fifa and Ifab made such a demonstration punishable by a mandatory yellow card,\u201d notes Seb Clare. \u201cBut who was the player to start this form of celebration?\u201d  \u201cScott Sinclair scored his first Bristol Rovers goal last year, a short 6,523 days after his debut on Boxing Day 2004. Is this the record for the longest gap between a player\u2019s debut and first goal?\u201d asks Tim Woods. Mail us your questions or tweet @TheKnowledge_GU."

                    "body": "Before the biggest event the Middle East has ever hosted, few regional states seemed to share in its neighbour\u2019s excitement. As the host country, Qatar, frantically completed its plans, there were even hints of glee as finishing touches fell short. Potholed atriums, expensive rooms, an overrun airport and even the last-minute beer ban were met with knowing smirks from many Gulf citizens who refused to share in the bonhomie. But four days into football\u2019s showpiece, with Arab teams performing beyond expectations and Saudi Arabia\u2019s giant-killers in particular shining bright, the World Cup has come to life across a region that is taking a belated collective pride. From the United Arab Emirates to Morocco and most points in between, the global sporting event of the year is now being fully embraced. \u201cNot long ago, we were all foes with Qatar,\u2019\u2019 said Salah al-Oleimi, a Saudi businessman from Jeddah. \u201cTheir airspace was closed, trade was banned, and there were no diplomatic ties,\u201d he said of the three-year boycott  by four Middle Eastern countries led by Mohammed bin Salman, the crown prince of Saudi Arabia. \u201cEverything shut down. We didn\u2019t see a Qatari for five years. \u201cBut now things are in the past. Football is a great leveller.\u201d In Dubai, a 30-minute flight from Doha, there was next to no sign of the approaching World Cup just days out from the opening match. But cafes along the city\u2019s Mohammed bin Rashid Boulevard were full on Wednesday as Germany lost to Japan, and teeming with fans a day earlier after the Saudi side\u2019s memorable win over Argentina. Political rivalry had never been far away from how the Gulf states viewed Qatar\u2019s winning bid to host the World Cup and had been central to its ambivalence since. \u201cThe GCC [Gulf Cooperation Council] is a bunch of feuding cousins who don\u2019t really like each other,\u201d said an Emirati official. \u201cBut football\u2019s given us a reason to get along for a while.\u201d In Kuwait, another GCC member, there was much praise for the performances of Saudi Arabia, Morocco and Tunisia, and some satisfaction at rival Iran\u2019s drubbing by England. But there was also a touch of envy about Qatar playing host. \u201cMay God bless them and help us. We\u2019ve had no achievements to celebrate,\u201d wrote one Kuwaiti fan on Instagram. \u201cI swear we are bothered by all the Gulf countries,\u201d wrote another Kuwaiti. \u201cThey show a commitment to football and fans, and we have the biggest support base in the region.\u201d  Buoyed up by its team\u2019s 2-1 win over Argentina, Saudi Arabia is now fully behind the event. Prince Mohammed was seen praying and embracing relatives after the game, and Qatar\u2019s emir, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani, briefly draped himself in a Saudi flag \u2013 an unthinkable gesture during the former political crisis \u2013 winning broad praise across social media. \u201cIn our neighbourhood, personal dignities are paramount and gestures like this can have historical implications,\u201d said Nowf al-Saud, a Riyadh-based student. The growing embrace of the World Cup is in contrast to the reaction in the UK and in many European countries, where Qatar\u2019s record with migrant workers who built its seven stadiums and attitude to LGBTQ+ rights continues to draw scathing headlines. There is little buy-in to either criticism across the Gulf, which was largely built on migrant labour and where homosexuality remains outlawed. \u201cLet\u2019s just concentrate on sport,\u201d said a Bahraini merchant, Ahmad Fakhro. \u201cThe cultural issues are for another day. When this event was awarded, the societal stands of the host were known. The values they promote are those of this region.\u201d Qataris have framed the scrutiny their country has received as racist or part of a hostile campaign directed by foreign enemies. \u201cIt is systematically orchestrated,\u201d said a businessman in the gas industry who declined to be named. \u201cWe want to sustain our way of life, why are we hated for that? Do you think there is no abuse in Europe?\u201d Mubaraka al-Marri, a businesswoman and social activist in Doha, said: \u201cWe know the media is one of the tools which is used to affect people. It\u2019s like a war. You don\u2019t need to use guns or fight countries or harm these countries, you use the media.\u201d  Mohammad al-Qassabi, 22, a graduate from a Doha university, said: \u201cWhat I\u2019ve noticed is that many have some stereotypes about some Gulf countries and some of them are wrong.\u201d But he claimed to see an upside: \u201cWhen the European and western media is describing the World Cup as a failure, but then it happens to be a success, everyone will be impressed. If they have low expectations it\u2019s easier to impress them.\u201d Outside the region, the event has routinely been labelled the most controversial World Cup ever and organisers have been accused of ignoring Fifa directives banning discrimination and offering equal access. World football\u2019s global body has been accused of ignoring its own values. Rainbow flags and scarves have been confiscated from fans outside stadiums and guards have stopped displays of public affection. \u201cThis is a clash of values,\u201d said an Emirati fan in Dubai. \u201cLet\u2019s move past it. I hope the clash of teams is remembered more.\u201d Additional reporting by Michael Safi"

                    "body": "Imagine being a Wales fan and not going to the World Cup. It is the first time they have qualified since 1958, which was so long ago that the goal that knocked them out was scored by an unknown teenager called Pel\u00e9. Sixty-four years later and it is Gareth Bale, Aaron Ramsey and Rob Page looking to set the world on fire. What a time to be alive! Except, for some Wales fans, they are going to pass, thanks very much. Some of the same supporters who found themselves in tears of ecstasy in Zenica, on their way to Euro 2016 despite defeat by Bosnia-Herzegovina, or who phoned home to delay their return one more time as Chris Coleman\u2019s team became the sensation of the finals in France, are choosing to sit this one out. If anyone has reckoned with the complicated issues surrounding this much-maligned tournament, it is them.  Kevin Davies is a veteran of nearly 70 away trips with the Welsh national team. He has seen them lose in Montenegro and Macedonia and get thumped 5-0 by Georgia. He was also in the stadium in Bordeaux six years ago when it suddenly transpired that 25,000 had made it to the Slovakia game and were belting out the anthem in unison. \u201cIf I was English there would have been no doubt in my mind, I wouldn\u2019t have gone,\u201d he says. \u201cBut for a Welsh supporter, to decide not to go to a World Cup is a huge decision. It may never happen again in my lifetime.\u201d For Davies, his argument for staying at home begins with an ethical consideration, one that dates back to 2010. \u201cWhen Qatar were awarded the competition,\u201d he says, \u201cmy immediate reaction was: \u2018I don\u2019t want any part of that. It\u2019s not a footballing decision, it\u2019s a money decision.\u2019\u201d He was aware then of the disparity in human rights between the Gulf state and his own nation. But that in itself would not have stopped him travelling to the country. \u201cI\u2019ve been to China, I\u2019ve been to Israel, I\u2019ve been to America, places where human rights and regimes are not popular,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I looked at it in a different way: I was going there to support Wales against that country. Going to Qatar is different. It\u2019s endorsing the World Cup, it\u2019s endorsing Fifa.\u201d Another Kevin, Kevin Ashton, isn\u2019t going either. He lives in Caerphilly and banged up and down France in a camper van for a month in what he calls the time of his life. He describes the decision to award the tournament to Qatar as \u201cunfortunate\u201d and says the country\u2019s treatment of migrant workers and minorities put him off before Wales even qualified. He also says the apparent assurances that certain laws \u2013 such as those regarding displays of public affection \u2013 might be relaxed during the tournament almost make things worse. \u201cBasically they\u2019re saying they do have laws that aren\u2019t consistent with most other countries and we\u2019ll go back to it once everyone\u2019s gone,\u201d he says.  But the feeling that this tournament wasn\u2019t for either supporter extended beyond a political or moral consideration. Indeed for both the thing that seems to nag them most is a fear that it \u2026 just might not be any fun. \u201cNow we\u2019ve qualified my major reason for not going is the logistics,\u201d says Davies. \u201cHow are you going to get there, how much is it going to cost to stay in places, will it be easy to do it?\u201d He describes how most of his friends are avoiding the limitations of booking accommodation through the official World Cup portal by staying in Dubai instead. But that entails a shuttle flight before dawn on the day of a game. \u201cI know a lot of people who are going, I\u2019ve got no problem with that, but they\u2019re jumping through so many hoops.\u201d Ashton says his entire stay in France cost less than half what he anticipated 10 days and three group games in Qatar might cost him, noting that by qualifying through the playoffs (with victory over Ukraine) whatever cheaper flights or accommodation might have been available was missed by Wales fans. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to go some place and spend 5K, 6K, 7K,\u201d he says, \u201cwhen you\u2019re coming back you want people to be like: \u2019Don\u2019t bring it up, he goes on and on about it all the time!\u2019 I don\u2019t want people asking me how it was only to say: \u2018It was all right.\u2019\u201d  Both men mention their concern over recording a positive Covid test and the knock-on effect that might have on their experience. Last week Qatar dropped the requirement for a negative result upon entry, but perhaps too late for it not to have featured in travelling fans\u2019 thinking. Either way, it appears \u201chassle\u201d has played largely on both men\u2019s minds. That\u2019s not to say that there isn\u2019t the odd pang of uncertainty about their decision. \u201cPerhaps I might feel a bit differently if we achieve what we achieved in France,\u201d Davies says. \u201cI don\u2019t want us to lose games, I want us to win the World Cup! But if that happens it\u2019s going to be pretty bittersweet.\u201d The consolation for Davies, who ties his away travel to fundraising work for the football charity G\u00f4l, is that there is always another tournament round the corner. \u201cI\u2019m really looking forward to the next Euros in Germany,\u201d he says. \u201cThat will be bliss for a football fan. In my opinion, Germany is the best country to watch football. Everything from the grounds, to the culture, to the transportation. I really hope we qualify, I\u2019ll be all over that.\u201d"

                    "body": "Sunday\nNo more sleeps. And not an overwhelming sense of a country waking up with World Cup fever. The assignment is to reflect what it is like in Doha as Qatar opens the first World Cup to be staged in the Middle East with a game against Ecuador. On a two-hour walk around the city before ending up at Souq Waqif, a traditional magnet for locals and tourists, the only signs of World Cup life are an organised gathering for Qataris (100 maximum) outside Millennium Plaza, a few cars driving past waving both Qatar and Palestine flags, and two men sat outside a refrigerator repair shop with a TV propped up on a chair. Souq Waqif is livelier, although more people are gathered around a Korean technology stand than looking for the game. There is dangerous overcrowding at the Fan Festival, however, where too many people descend on the 40,000-capacity venue and are kept in a holding area for almost an hour before being herded away. An inevitable consequence, you might say, of hosting a World Cup in and around one city that offers few options for football fans.\n\nMonday\nA day at the main media centre, the football journalist\u2019s equivalent of The Terminal starring Tom Hanks. You might never leave. And that might be the point. It has a hair and beauty salon, a gym, a dry cleaners, a bar, restaurants, a vast working area, two virtual stadium \u201cexperiences\u201d (watching matches at the cinema, basically), two press conference rooms and a bus terminus from where you can travel to all the games. The France head coach, Didier Deschamps, is besieged with requests for selfies from local journalists after previewing the world champions\u2019 opener against Australia. There is standing room only for Argentina\u2019s press conference due to the appearance of Lionel Messi and there is a rush for the exits when he finishes, leaving Saudi Arabia head coach, Herv\u00e9 Renard, to address an almost deserted auditorium. The world\u2019s media will be hanging on his every word inside 24 hours.\n\nTuesday\nJackpot. Covering Messi at his last World Cup was already special but Argentina v Saudi Arabia exceeds all expectations. On the metro up to Lusail Stadium it feels like a World Cup is finally under way with carriages crammed with Argentina and Saudi supporters in full voice. The atmosphere inside the World Cup final venue is exceptional and builds as Saudi Arabia produce one of the biggest shocks in the competition\u2019s history. An unforgettable moment. Then it\u2019s off to the Fan Festival to watch France v Australia. A 500ml can of Budweiser \u2013 the only alcohol available \u2013 costs 50 Qatari riyal, roughly \u00a311.50.\nWednesday\nApartment \u2013 metro \u2013 media centre \u2013 bus \u2013 stadium \u2013 metro \u2013 apartment. This, more or less, is the daily work routine. Monotonous, yes, but you\u2019re not missing out on much in Qatar. It\u2019s the Ahmad Bin Ali Stadium tonight for Canada\u2019s first World Cup appearance in 36 years. They should beat Belgium; they lose, on account of never scoring at a World Cup. It is now four World Cup games without a goal for Canada. A record. The 10pm kick-off means getting back to the apartment at 3.15am, once everything is filed and the last metro is caught. It could be worse: the journalist next to me in the stadium opened a bottle of Coca-Cola before kick-off that exploded everywhere but mainly down into his laptop. It died.\nThursday\nWhile taking in the sights on a walk along the Corniche, Doha\u2019s seven-kilometre promenade, word comes through of a late ticket for Brazil v Serbia at Lusail Stadium. We were given a Qatar-controlled \u201clook at the safe and happy migrant labourers tour\u201d of the World Cup final venue under construction three years ago while here with Liverpool for the Club World Cup. It was a stadium in a desert. Now it is a stadium next to a growing city of glittering towers, architecturally stunning hotels, apartment blocks, boulevards and Place Vendo\u0302me mall, a French-Vegas style construction covering 1,150,000 square metres. It\u2019s taken longer for Liverpool city council to reconfigure Lime Street, as Richarlison can testify. Now he\u2019s flinging himself into World Cup superstardom.\n\nFriday\nThe power of the World Cup strikes like a bolt. The sound of the Iran national anthem being booed and whistled by Iranians before kick-off against Wales and the sight of Iranian women and men left distraught afterwards is incredibly moving. It serves as another rebuke to the pathetic appeal by Fifa president, Gianni Infantino, for everyone to \u201cstick to the football\u201d. Security guards following orders confiscate an Iran fan\u2019s football shirt that has \u201cMahsa Amini 22\u201d printed on the back, the name and age of the woman whose death in police custody sparked the ongoing protests in the country. Shame on Fifa. There are reports of fans being arrested for carrying flags opposed to the Islamic republic and for banners with the protest slogan \u2018Women, life, freedom\u2019. Shame on Qatar. Iran players somehow block out the powerful distractions to produce an emotion-charged victory.\nSaturday\nApartment \u2013 metro \u2013 media centre \u2013 bus \u2013 stadium \u2013 metro \u2013 apartment."

                    "body": "\n 1.06pm  \n\nPleased to say that Rob Smyth is helming our liveblog on the opening ceremony and the World Cup opener, starring Ecuador and hosts Qatar. \n\nI\u2019m signing off here. But give Rob\u2019s blog a click, and enjoy the rest of your Sunday. Ta ra! \n\n\n\n 12.55pm  \n\nOne of the most interesting little subplots of this World Cup is that Luis Enrique, Spain\u2019s manager, has set up his own Twitch account, streaming live and direct to the fans. This is a clip from a recent post, where he discusssed the fluidity of their attackers.\n\nOne of Luis Enrique\u2019s attackers, Ferran Torres, is dating his daughters, Sira Mart\u00ednez. Both the Barcelona forward and the former Barcelona boss have been speaking about that. This is via Reuters. \n\u201cNot at all,\u201d Torres told a news conference on Sunday when asked whether he felt pressure because of the relationship. \u201cI think the coach and I, we know how to differentiate between when it\u2019s family and when we are manager and player. I think we have to get on with it in a natural way, just that and we\u2019re getting along fine.\u201d\nTorres, 22, went public about his relationship with Sira Martinez, a Spanish show-jumper who is also 22, this year. Luis Enrique joked about it on Saturday when he was asked which of the Spain players represented an extension of him on the field of play.\n\u201cVery easy - it\u2019s Mr Ferran Torres - otherwise my daughter will come after me and chop off my head,\u201d the coach said in an online chat. \n\nUpdated at 12.57pm GMT\n\n\n 12.35pm  \n\nBack to Qatar we go. Jacob Steinberg has written this piece on Raheem Sterling, who marked the 10th anniversary of his England Debut last Monday. \n\nEven though his form for Chelsea is a concern, it would represent a major surprise if Sterling does not start against Iran.\nThe England shirt no longer weighs heavily on Sterling. This is the 27-year-old\u2019s fifth international tournament, underlining his importance to the side, and it is startling to consider how much has changed in the last decade. To put it into context, Gareth Southgate was working on the Sweden game as a pundit for ITV. Sterling was 17 and had just broken into the Liverpool side. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n 12.18pm  \n\nWhile we\u2019re on club football \u2026 Chelsea welcome Tottenham to a sold-out Stamford Bridge in the WSL\n\nand there\u2019s this \u2026\n\n\n\n\n 12.07pm  \n\nThis is a decent stat, albeit related to club football. Bale has only one trophyless season since 2012-13, his loan spell back with Spurs \u2026 \n\n\n\n\n\n 12.03pm  \n\nHello everyone. We\u2019ll start with this fine piece on Wales and Gareth Bale, who play their first World Cup match in 64 years on Monday night against the USA. Absolutely mouthwatering. \n\n\n\n\n 11.38am  \n\nThat\u2019s all from me \u2013 I\u2019ll hand over to my colleague Michael Butler for the foreseeable.\n\n\n\n 11.37am  \n\nA minor historic moment yesterday:\n\nBalloons in the national colours of Israel and Qatar festooned the departure gate for the first commercial flight between the countries on Sunday, permitted by Doha for fans of the World Cup despite the absence of formal bilateral relations.\n\n\nThe passengers\u2019 excitement was mainly at being able to attend the soccer tournament - for which Israel did not qualify - with such surprising ease. But several also voiced hope that the temporary non-stop connections would clear the way to fuller detente between the Gulf emirate and Israel.\n\n\nThey were issued contact cards for a discreet Israeli consular delegation sent ahead to provide emergency support - a reminder of their current semi-recognised status in Qatar, which is close to Iran and has hosted leaders of Palestinian Hamas.\n\n\n\u201cThere were a few concerns, I cannot deny that,\u201d said Sagi Ashkevitz, who was flying out with three friends to his second World Cup. \u201cBut in the end, the idea of watching Messi for the last time, together with the idea that we are actually making history, overcame all of the concerns, and we are happy to be a part of it.\u201d\n\n(Via Reuters)\n\n\n\n 11.32am  \n\nFile under \u2018shocking and entirely unsurprising\u2019:\n\n\n\n\n 11.25am  \n\nOne thing the Dutch have got right about their goalkeepers is the squad numbers. Their three keepers will wear numbers 1, 13 and 23 \u2013 the objectively correct formulation. Staggeringly, they are one of only three squads at this tournament to have numbered their goalies as such. The other two? England and Spain. Now that\u2019s insight.\n\nUpdated at 11.27am GMT\n\n\n 11.14am  \n\nOh dear\u2026\n\n\n\n\n 11.09am  \n\n\n\n\n\n 11.09am  \n\nAn interesting subplot from the ever-intriguing Dutch camp: who the hell is going to play in goal? Whoever gets the jersey against Senegal tomorrow will be vastly inexperienced after the shock snub of Jasper Cillessen, who most pundits assumed would be Louis van Gaal\u2019s first choice. Instead, he picked three keepers with \u2013 wait for it \u2013 eight caps between them.\nAjax\u2019s Remko Pasveer won his first cap against Poland in September. He is 39. Justin Bijlow was used by Van Gaal in his first six games in charge but not used in the nine matches since \u2013 and has only recently become Feyenoord\u2019s No 1. Uncapped Andries Noppert from Heerenveen is the other goalkeeper in the squad. \n(Info via Reuters)\n\n\n\n\nUpdated at 11.23am GMT\n\n\n 10.47am  \n\nWest Ham defender Thilo Kehrer feels vindicated in moving to the Premier League in an effort to nail down his World Cup spot. \n\u201cI wanted to have the best rhythm and be fully fit and competitive for the World Cup. That was a major reason for me,\u201d said the player who has featured in every league match since joining from PSG in the summer. \n\u201cIt has paid off so far. It was a big challenge and that\u2019s what I was looking for and it is a very good preparation for the World Cup. I feel the confidence of Hansi [Flick] and you can see that in my playing time. I will give it all to pay back this trust.\u201d\n(via Reuters)\n\n\n\n 10.42am  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n 10.35am  \n\nBad news for the Socceroos:\n\n\n\n\n 10.32am  \n\nHere\u2019s reader Michael Ohl on the Infantino speech: \u201cIt is not binary issue. Yes, the west should look at itself and our historic abuses. But just because the west behaved as bad, if not worse, it is not a good enough reason for not condemning abuses happening in all countries around the world today, including Qatar. War, colonialism, subjugation by one nation on another nation, state sanctioned killing people, torturing people, discriminating against people or abusing people for whatever reason is wrong and has always been wrong, and that applies to all eras and all countries.\u201d\nKurt Perleberg keeps things simple: \u201cIs this Fifa World Cup turning out to be the worst sporting event of all time?\u201d\n\nUpdated at 10.32am GMT\n\n\n 10.22am  \n\nFawad Azam writes in: \u201cI do find the tirade against Qatar a tad hypocritical. We all know the awarding of Russia and Qatar was riddled with issues. However I do agree that bringing the World Cup has put a spotlight on the issues in Qatar and forced some changes which wouldn\u2019t have happened otherwise, such as banning the Kafala system and minimum wage. The problems with migrant workers is still an issue in many parts of the gulf which Brits are more than happy to holiday in every year but we have no issues when taking our selfies at the pool.\n\u201cWe have had China hosting the Olympics with their human rights track record and Russia hosting the last World Cup four years after it had illegally annexed Crimea. We have Egypt currently hosting COP27 with its human rights abuses. I don\u2019t think these hosting duties go to model countries. But then again what is a model country? In UK we have migrant fruit pickers who are going back home to Indonesia after only eight weeks of work despite being offered six months\u2019 worth. They are now riddled with years of debt.\n\u201cI am not white and don\u2019t drink alcohol. I am going to the World Cup for the first time, some may mistake me as a fake fan! The \u2018fake fan\u2019 accusations brings a whole new angle into the racism of what is a \u2018true fan\u2019.\n\u201cHowever this is probably the only time I have felt safe and comfortable going to a World Cup without the fear of hooliganism and drunken behaviour. Previously would have never considered going to any other World Cup as being a brown England fan I would stick out in the wrong way from either side. So for me Qatar hosting the World Cup has opened the door to people like me who have otherwise not been able to attend.\u201d\n\n\n\n 10.10am  \n\nEl Diego klaxon! Here\u2019s an extract from Diego Maradona: The Last Interview &amp; Other Conversations \u2013 a 1992 discussion in which the crazed genius talks Baggio, Berlusconi and USA 94:\n\n\n\n\n 10.03am  \n\nRuben Neves knows which side his bread is buttered on. Here\u2019s the Portugal midfielder on You Know Who: \u201cFrom what I\u2019ve seen in training, he\u2019s in spectacular shape. He doesn\u2019t worry us at all, we as a team know perfectly well what we need to work on so that each individual stands out on gameday. If we\u2019re good as a team, Cristiano will be phenomenal.\u201d\n\n\nUpdated at 10.08am GMT\n\n\n 9.47am  \n\nAntonio Rudiger reckons Germany can go the distance. He would say that, wouldn\u2019t he?\n\n\n\nUpdated at 11.19am GMT\n\n\n 9.36am  \n\nMeanwhile, back in the Northern Premier League:\n\n\n\n\n 9.32am  \nWelsh first minister Mark Drakeford reacts to Infantino\n\nThe first signs of fallout from Infantino\u2019s speech come from the Welsh first minister, Mark Drakeford. Here\u2019s what he has to say:\n\nI had two thoughts when I heard those comments. First of all, I think there is a serious point about being prepared to review our own history. Wales is an outward-looking, inclusive nation where people\u2019s rights really matter to us. But it wasn\u2019t always like that. In our own history, we have had times when things that we have done, including things that we have done in other parts of the world, wouldn\u2019t measure up to the sorts of beliefs and standards that we hold ourselves to today. So to take a moment to reflect on our own histories, it\u2019s not a moment wasted.\nThe second thought I had listening to what was said was to remind me of Healy\u2019s first law of holes. Some people will remember Denis Healey, the great labour politician. And his first law of holes was when you\u2019re in one, stop digging.\n\n(via Reuters)\n\nUpdated at 9.41am GMT\n\n\n 9.14am  \n\nIn case you missed it last night \u2013 Karim Benzema becomes an automatic pick for the Injured World Cup XI. In fact, N\u2019Golo Kante and Paul Pogba would be part of that team, too \u2013 poor old France. Luckily they still have the adoring Mbappe-Giroud partnership up front. Fraternit\u00e9!\n\n\nUpdated at 9.48am GMT\n\n\n 8.59am  \n\nFun fact: Raheem Sterling made his England debut alongside Leon Osman, Steven Caulker and Carl Jenkinson. Ten years later, he\u2019s a senior figure in the squad and battling against younger upstarts for a place in Southgate\u2019s XI. He\u2019s out of form but I\u2019d still have him in the side tomorrow, ahead of Grealish and Rashford. You?\n\n\n\n\n 8.51am  \n\nA few have pointed out that Gianni\u2019s speech yesterday bore a striking resemblance to one made by former Governor of New York Andrew Cuomo from back in 2017. Great minds?\n\n\n\n\n 8.48am  \n\nManaging Brazil at a World Cup \u2013 the hardest job in football? Happily, their current boss seems to have a healthy perspective. \u201cWhether we win or not, I want to be at peace,\u201d says Tite. \u201cAt peace with myself. That\u2019s my big desire.\u201d\nSomething tells me that sense of inner peace might be a lot easier to find from the champions\u2019 podium on 18 December. Read the full interview here:\n\n\n\n\n 8.36am  \n\nWales\u2019s World Cup gets under way tomorrow evening. Here, former winger Terry Medwin remembers the country\u2019s first \u2013 and last \u2013 appearance at the tournament, when they were knocked out by an unknown 17-year-old called Pel\u00e9:\n\n\n\n\n 8.33am  \n\nNow then. That Infantino speech eh? \u201cToday I feel Qatari,\u201d said the 52-year-old Swiss-Italian man yesterday. \u201cToday I feel Arabic. Today I feel African. Today I feel gay. Today I feel disabled. Today I feel like a migrant worker.\u201d\nNot, apparently, a Gervais-esque send-up of modern identity politics but rather an earnest plea for open-mindedness and unity during the course of this tournament. Here\u2019s our report, here\u2019s Barney Ronay\u2019s take, and here\u2019s our in-house fact-check on what exactly was said. Are we being too harsh on Gianni, or is there a kernel of a clumsily-delivered half-decent point in there somewhere? Thoughts welcome.\n\n\n\n 8.21am  \n\nLet\u2019s kick off with some Sunday-morning listening: \n\n\n\n\n 8.17am  \nPreamble\n\n\u201cIt will be the best World Cup ever \u2013 of course.\u201d Those the words of Gianni Infantino about an event marred before a ball has been kicked by criminality, corruption and death \u2013 and yet somehow the least contentious statement of yesterday\u2019s grand address. (More on that shortly.)\nToday, at least, we\u2019ll get to put his theory to the test. That\u2019s right: 12 years after the World Cup was awarded to Qatar in a decision that left even David Beckham lost for words, the day is finally here and it looks like we\u2019re actually going through with it.\n\u201cFocus on the football\u201d is another favourite Infantino directive. We can do a bit of that this afternoon, when the hosts face Ecuador at the gleaming new Al Bayt Stadium. And if the prospect of the planet\u2019s 44th and 50th best international sides locking horns wasn\u2019t enough for you, there\u2019ll be a lavish opening ceremony beforehand featuring K-pop superstar Jeon Jungkook and nay-pop superstars the Black Eyed Peas.\nBut before then we will have an uninterrupted stream of news, previews, buildup, correspondence, interviews, debates, squabbles, quibbles, protestations, trivia, reminiscences, hopes, dreams and regrets from this strangest of World Cups \u2026 plus a bit of football, too. Got any of the above? Please send them through via email.\nSo kick back, crack open a Bud Zero, and stay tuned for live updates from day one of Qatar 2022.\n\n"

                    "body": "The camera slowly zooms in on Lionel Messi\u2019s face. And keeps zooming. And keeps zooming. The lens is steady, the focus deep and dramatic, blurring everything but the sole object of its attention. The camera keeps zooming.\nSoon Messi\u2019s shoulders are no longer visible. Then his neck disappears, then his chin. The camera keeps zooming. It is moments before Argentina and Mexico are about to step out in Lusail and the greatest player in the world is being subjected to the photographic equivalent of a nasal swab.\nSomething weird has been happening at this World Cup. Of course lots of weird things have been happening at this World Cup but this appears to be a more subtle development, a quiet shift in tone and aesthetic. You can see it in the television coverage, with its deep focuses and swooping aerial shots, a product that feels increasingly cinematic in scope and style. This process, to some extent, has been going on for a while. But perhaps the more startling development is the way the digital world is also beginning to bleed into the live experience.\n\nFor most of the last century, football has existed essentially as two parallel games. There was the game of tickets and stadiums and grass and physical seats, a world that you could see and hear and smell and touch. \nThen there was the game that came filtered through a screen, a world of buttons and pixels, mediated by commentators and TV producers, theme music and editing. Qatar 2022 is perhaps the first World Cup where the division between these two worlds is no longer clear.\nOne can sense this from the moment one climbs the steps and emerges into the arena itself, which at this tournament feels less like entering a sporting venue and more like beaming through a portal. Loud, pumping, wall-to-wall music fills every conceivable space and orifice. The tunes stop a few seconds before the game begins and kicks in a second after the whistle blows. On the big screens, adverts for crypto\u2011trading compete for attention with the booming, rib\u2011juddering din of the official pitchside announcer, jabbering away like a circus ringmaster.\n\nUp in the stands you are vaguely aware that there are thousands of fans singing and swaying around you, and yet their unlicensed noise is almost invariably drowned out by the officially licensed noise resounding from the speakers. Occasionally the announcer will stop and invite the fans to \u201cmake some noise\u201d. Which, in fairness, is what they had been doing the whole time. But at Qatar 2022 it doesn\u2019t matter how many you are or how loud you are. You will speak only when spoken to.\nEven when the real game begins, the virtual world still somehow manages to seep in. You will doubtless be familiar with the ghostly, disembodied digital mannequins of the semi-automated offside technology. But for spectators in the stadium this is just one part of a ceaseless computer-generated cyclorama being enacted on the giant screens. Animated graphics interpose every few seconds bearing live statistics (line breaks, contested possession, direction of attack). Later in the game the screens show replays of earlier incidents rendered \u2013 for some unfathomable reason \u2013 in CGI, so you can see a digital avatar of Raheem Sterling crossing for a digital avatar of Harry Kane, even though you saw the actual thing about five minutes earlier.\nAll this, of course, is if you choose solely to watch the game through the time-honoured medium of your eyes. Open the Fifa+ app, however, and a whole new panorama presents itself. Using its augmented reality mask, you can point your phone at the pitch and see it transform into a heatmap, overlay live stats on to the turf, watch the same slow\u2011motion replays being served to viewers at home. Which is, from a technological standpoint, extremely impressive. But it does raise a fundamental question: if the future of football is watching a live game through your phone screen, then what exactly is the point of being there? There is, of course, an element of \u201cold man yells at cloud\u201d about all this.\n\nDoubtless this live/digital hybrid is probably aimed at the younger end of the market: the generation that grew up consuming much of its football not in stadiums or on television but through video game consoles, and latterly through online games such as Fifa Ultimate Team. And really what we are seeing is not so much the melting of the stadium experience into the television experience but the melting of both into the gaming experience, with its regenerating soundtrack, its intuitive haptics and cinematic visuals, its perpetual scroll of data and graphics. Wherever you are, however you watch, football resembles an increasingly curated product while offering the illusion of perpetual user control.\nThis is the first Web3 World Cup and Qatar is in many ways the perfect test tube for this daring experiment: the metaverse as country, an unsettling world of layers upon layers, where you are never quite sure what is real and what is virtual, or whether it even makes sense to distinguish between the two. Sometimes you walk down the street and feel a sudden blast of cold air, with no grille or fan to offer any clue as to where it came from. At the Villaggio Mall in Doha a gondolier will take you on a tour of its replica Venetian canal system. The official attendance at many World Cup matches has been higher than the official stadium capacity.\nEverything is real. Nothing is real. If what we are watching is increasingly curated, to what extent can we trust what we are watching? When we press the button, are we actually choosing to press the button, or are we simply being funnelled around like shoppers through an infinite digital hypermarket? Is this still a sport, or simply an entertainment product being cleverly packaged as a sport? These are questions without definitive answers. After all, this is your game, and you can play it however you want."

                    "body": "\u201cWe are convinced of the power of our game.\u201d A short phrase by Gianni Infantino, the president of Fifa, from his closing press conference at this winter\u2019s World Cup. Compared with his opening speech some four weeks previously, a wild-eyed address that went viral in a manner unusual for sports administrators, it appears harmless enough. But the more you stare at the words, the more revealing the sentence becomes. The power of football has been a matter of contention for the duration of Qatar 2022. What the world\u2019s most popular spectator sport symbolises, what it can achieve, and what it can cover up have been the subject of intense debate. Tomorrow the tournament reaches its climax with a blue-chip final between France and Argentina. As the world tunes in, perhaps now is the time to draw conclusions as to the effect of such power. The first conclusion is that football had enough to persuade a tiny, inordinately wealthy Gulf state to spend a quarter of a trillion dollars. The estimated cost to Qatar of staging the World Cup is $220bn, a price that has transformed the country. It has built seven stadiums, a metro network, even a new city in the eerie, ersatz shape of Lusail, the location for the final. Everything that Qatar wanted to show to the world, either to those who visited for the tournament or \u2013 more importantly \u2013 the billions watching on television, has been brand new. The cost of building this new Qatar cannot be quantified purely by money. In the years, months, weeks and days leading up to the World Cup, consistent attention was drawn to a hidden price: the death, injury and exploitation of thousands of migrant workers lured to the Gulf. Awareness was also raised as to the absence of rights afforded LGBTQ+ people in the country, although less attention was paid to its oppressive laws on women.  A second conclusion about the power of football would be that it created the space for journalists and NGOs to highlight issues that might otherwise have remained out of sight. Ultimately, any such focus began to dissipate when the World Cup finally started. For Fifa, it was about time. Before the tournament Infantino told countries looking for guarantees on a human rights legacy to \u201clet football take the stage\u201d. On the eve of the opening match, and after declaring he felt Qatari, gay and a migrant worker in the same breath, he booted the question of football\u2019s responsibility for suffering caused by the World Cup into the indeterminate future. There would, Infantino said, be a \u201clabour excellence hub\u201d established in Doha at some point. But there would be no centre for migrant workers looking to protect their rights and no financial remedy for those who had experienced loss. Instead a legacy fund would be directed at educating children across the world. Meanwhile, and never publicly, a number of European sides were told to stop wearing armbands that showed solidarity with LGBTQ+ people in the region. Never mind the human rights, here came the football, and it arrived in unprecedented form. Never before had a World Cup been played in such a compressed geographical area; the distance between the northernmost stadium at Al Bayt and the southernmost, Al Janoub, was some 40 miles. Never before had four games been played in a single day of a World Cup, as they were through the group stage. For those in Qatar, as well as those viewing at home, it was possible to gorge on football \u2013 especially when most fixtures were far from sold out. After a typically limp performance from the hosts on opening night, Qatar losing 2-0 to Ecuador in front of an ambivalent crowd at Al Bayt, the tournament caught fire in quick order. On day two, England scored six against Iran, putting a smile back on the face of players \u2013 especially Bukayo Saka \u2013 last seen broken after the final of last year\u2019s European Championship. Day three brought the first shock \u2013 Saudi Arabia coming from a goal behind to beat Lionel Messi\u2019s Argentina. An epochal moment for football in the Gulf, it was marked by bizarre symbols: the emir of Qatar draping the flag of his country\u2019s fierce rival around his shoulders; Saudi fans marching through the streets of Doha like European ultras; Messi\u2019s face in every Qatari ad break boosting Saudi as a tourist destination. More weirdness and many more upsets were to follow. Japan beat first Germany then Spain by summoning brief, irresistible bursts of frenzied play which overran their opponents. Brazil\u2019s Richarlison scored a scissor kick against Serbia that signalled to the world jogo bonito was back, while Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 of France laid claim to the title of \u201cbest player in the world\u201d with a streak of devastating finishing. Australia knocked out Denmark with canny counterattacking, South Korea did the same to Uruguay with a perfect late breakaway against Portugal, and suddenly, for the first time, a representative of every continent had reached the knockout stages. Joining the usual phalanx of European and South American teams were the US, Australia, Japan, South Korea, Senegal and Morocco. As the knockout stages began, something like regular service was resumed. Many of the upstarts were taken care of and some in dramatic fashion, including Korea\u2019s 4-1 humbling by Brazil and Senegal\u2019s comprehensive 3-0 defeat by England. But Morocco stayed in, edging past Spain on penalties in the last 16, then beating Portugal to become the first African side to reach a semi-final \u2013 an achievement that tilted the world of football very slightly on its axis.  Relatively few fans travelled to this World Cup and official crowd statistics felt inflated or unreliable, itself a common sensation. But it was inarguable that Morocco, alongside Argentina and Saudi Arabia, were among the countries who had travelled in decent numbers. The presence of armies of supporters in red and green and lion outfits illuminated Doha and helped to give the World Cup a distinct character that all the branding, light shows and hype men of Qatar couldn\u2019t muster. On the pitch, Morocco were rigorous, unrelenting and lifted by moments of magic from Hakim Ziyech, Achraf Hakimi and the goalkeeper Yassine \u201cBono\u201d Bounou. Off the pitch they were humble and determined, respectful to opponents but not afraid to embrace the joy of their success or, in the case of the forward Sofiane Boufal, dance with their mother on the touchline. Whether they represented Africa, the Arab world or the power of diaspora, the Atlas Lions and their fans told a story that was relatable the entire world over. Ultimately, Morocco were done for by France, who, even in taking out an impressive England in the quarter-finals, seemed to play only when they had to (but knew precisely when that ought to be). On the other side of the draw, Argentina had recovered from their opening setback to grow stronger throughout, with Messi rolling back the years as they did so. His dominant performance in the semi-final against Croatia, and especially his tormenting of the star defender Jo\u0161ko Gvardiol, made comparisons to the national icon Diego Maradona no longer feel inappropriate. At last, the star of an individualistic age looked set to deliver for his country, only for the final obstacle to be Mbapp\u00e9, another superstar whose reputation has been built on bursts of solo brilliance. The final should be a fitting end to a tournament that has displayed international football at its best. Just by reeling through the highlights, the problems of this World Cup \u2013 and there were more, from actions taken against protesting Iranian fans to an effective ban on the rainbow flag \u2013 fade into the background. It is this power which Infantino says he is \u201cconvinced\u201d of. The joy of the game, he argues, is a panacea for the ills that afflict society or, at least, a screen to block them out. \u201cI believe those fans who come to the stadium and the billions of fans watching on TV \u2026 they want to spend 90 minutes without having to think about anything else, forget their problems and enjoy football,\u201d he said on Friday. Infantino has tested the effectiveness of this power in Qatar and plans to use it to extend the influence of Fifa. The men\u2019s World Cup is to expand to 48 nations in four years\u2019 time, and Fifa has plans for a 32-team men\u2019s Club World Cup from 2025. All this expansion must be enabled by money, and bringing the World Cup to the Gulf has generated $7.5bn of it. Infantino can get more from the Saudis, who want to host the tournament in 2030, or perhaps return to previous plans to welcome China into the bosom of the football family. Despite his conviction, however, perhaps Infantino is wrong. Maybe the power of football is not as the opium of the masses, but as something that glimmers beyond the machinations of power. Maybe this past month has reminded us once more that what matters about the beautiful game, what draws so many towards it, is the joy that comes from play and collective endeavour. Something which, still, remains accessible to all."

                    "body": "Dispute over the legacy of staging the men\u2019s World Cup in Qatar broke out on the floor of the Fifa Congress on Thursday, with the president of the Norwegian Football Federation calling for stronger action, only for the head of Qatar\u2019s Supreme Committee to insist she \u201ceducate\u201d herself over the issues.\nIn a tightly managed set-piece event in Doha before Friday\u2019s World Cup draw, Lise Klaveness\u2019s address upset the consensus when she said Fifa must act as a \u201crole model\u201d and called on the organisation to do more to support the families of migrant workers who had been killed and those injured working on the World Cup project.\n\n\u201cOur game can inspire dreams and break down barriers but as leaders we must do it right and to the highest standards,\u201d said Klaveness, a former Norway international. \u201cWe cannot ignore the calls for change and how Fifa runs the game has so much to say for how the game is perceived. Fifa must act as a role model.\n\u201cIn 2010 World Cups were awarded by Fifa in unacceptable ways with unacceptable consequences. Human rights, equality and democracy \u2013 the core interests of football \u2013 were not in the starting XI.. These basic rights were pressured on to the field as substitutes, mainly by outside voices. Fifa has addressed these issues but there is still a long way to go.\u201d\nKlaveness went on to call for specific reforms. \u201cMigrant workers injured or families of those who died in the buildup to the World Cup must be cared for.\u201d \nThe Norwegian FA president\u2019s speech was followed by an unexpected address from the general secretary of the Honduran FA, Jos\u00e9 Ernesto Mej\u00eda, who said it was not \u201cthe right forum or the right moment\u201d to make such remarks.\nThe secretary general of the Supreme Committee for Delivery and Legacy (SC), Hassan al-Thawadi, then gave a passionate address defending the steps Qatar has taken since winning the right to host the World Cup. He said the country had undertaken \u201c12 years of continuous work \u2026 dedicated to ensuring this tournament leaves truly transformational social, human, economic and environmental legacies to be remembered. We are acutely aware of the spotlight that comes with hosting the greatest show on earth and we have embraced it.\u201d\n\nThawadi said that the most important legacy of the World Cup would be to correct prejudices that saw the Arab world as a place of conflict. He said he also wanted to reassure those concerned over a social legacy, citing the positive reports made by international trade unions over the development of workers\u2019 rights. \u201cOur adversaries have become allies,\u201d he said \u201c[and] even our harshest critics such as Amnesty recognise our commitment.\u201d\nHe also criticised Klaveness for not speaking to the SC individually about Norwegian concerns. \u201cOn [the issue of a] social legacy, I would like to assure the Norwegian FA,\u201d he said. \u201c[But] I\u2019d like to express a disappointment. Madame president visited our country and did not request a meeting. She did not attempt a dialogue before addressing Congress today. We have always been open for dialogue, we always welcomed constructive criticism. We have always had the doors open for anybody who wants to understand the issues, who wants to educate themselves before passing any judgment.\u201d\nThe Guardian understands that Klaveness has addressed Thawadi personally over the social legacy in Qatar.\nThere was also controversy over a moment later in the Congress when Fifa\u2019s president, Gianni Infantino, presented a video documenting the progress made on workers\u2019 and human rights in Qatar since it won the World Cup.\nThe video said that the SC was instrumental in ending the kafala system in the country and featured the general secretary of the Building and Woodworkers\u2019 International, Ambet Yuson, praising improvements in worker safety. \u201cThe health and safety standards in the stadium construction sites are at the same level as the health and safety standards in Europe,\u201d Yuson said.\n\nThe video also showed Piara Powar, chief executive of the Fare network which campaigns for equality in football, talking about dialogue over the safety of LGBTQ+ supporters in Qatar, where homosexuality remains illegal. Although Powar is quoted as being positive about the process, the Guardian understands that he also expressed concerns over a continued lack of guarantees over supporter safety, remarks not in the video.\nOn Thursday 16 organisations focused on LGBTIQ+ rights called for the SC to act on supporter safety, saying that action has been slow and that \u201creassurances about the safety of LGBTIQ+ people and the mechanisms in place to ensure safety have not been adequate\u201d. The organisations said they had submitted eight requests for action to Fifa and the SC, but had yet to receive any response from the latter.\nInfantino announced he was to run for a second four-year term as president."

                    "body": "Netherlands 4-0 Argentina: 1974 second group stage\nThe first World Cup meeting between the sides is not one Argentina will remember with fondness. They are ruthlessly torn apart in Gelsenkirchen by the brilliant Johan Cruyff-inspired Oranje, whose collective vision, movement and passing patterns are complemented by steely tackling and defensive discipline. Cruyff dances around the goalkeeper, Daniel Carnevali, to roll in the first after latching on to Johan Neeskens\u2019s chipped pass; it is the defender Wim Rijsbergen\u2019s crunching challenge that sets the platform for the attack. Ruud Krol soon rockets in the second from the edge of the area after a corner. In the second half, Cruyff whips an immaculate cross to the far post where Johnny Rep\u2019s bullet header makes it 3-0. On the sidelines, the Netherlands manager, Rinus Michels, laughs, claps and rubs his hands with glee. In the last minute, after yet another fluent passing move, Wim van Hanegem\u2019s close-range shot is beaten out by Carnevali, only for Cruyff to audaciously volley in from an angle. For a proud footballing nation such as Argentina it is particularly painful to be taught a lesson in such emphatic fashion. Total football; total domination.\n\nArgentina 3-1 Netherlands: 1978 final\n\nMuch like Qatar 2022, the 1978 tournament in Argentina is seriously tarnished by concerns over human rights abuses in the host nation: in this case the murderous military dictatorship of Jorge Rafael Videla. Before the tournament there is an international campaign for a boycott. Cruyff chooses not to play, but his decision is prompted mainly by a violent kidnapping attempt on him and his family in Barcelona rather than any political sensibilities. Rijsbergen and his teammate Wim Suurbier, instructed to ride bicycles while recovering from injuries during the tournament, visit Plaza de Mayo in Buenos Aires, to witness protests by the mothers of the disappeared. By the end of the final Videla has achieved his dual goal: legitimisation of his regime by hosting the World Cup and for Argentina to be champions. In a narrower sporting sense, the victory is revenge for Argentina\u2019s thrashing four years previously. After Mario Kempes slides in the opening goal, Dirk Nanninga\u2019s header forces extra time. Another from Kempes and a third by Daniel Bertoni crush the dreams of the Netherlands, who lose a second straight World Cup final.\n\nNetherlands 2-1 Argentina: 1998 quarter-final\nPatrick Kluivert\u2019s opener in Marseille is created by a wonderfully perceptive cushioned header by Dennis Bergkamp. Five minutes later, Argentina\u2019s equaliser arrives when the Netherlands botch their offside trap and Claudio L\u00f3pez sprints through one-on-one, patiently waiting for his moment before passing the ball through Edwin van der Sar\u2019s legs. Both teams are reduced to 10 men \u2013 Arthur Numan takes a second booking after fouling Diego Simeone while Ariel Ortega is sent off after clashing with Van der Sar three minutes from full-time. In the final minute, Argentina appear to have resigned themselves to extra time. They are content to let Frank de Boer advance towards halfway, backing off and allowing him time and space. It proves a costly error. De Boer drills a long diagonal pass, left to right, aimed at his former Ajax teammate Bergkamp. The Arsenal forward requires three touches with his right boot: the first to bring the ball perfectly under control after it floats over his left shoulder, another to cut back inside the covering run of the centre-back Roberto Ayala and a third to clip an expertly executed shot into the far corner beyond the helpless Carlos Roa in goal. An iconic moment and one of the greatest World Cup goals. \u201cA dream,\u201d De Boer would later say.\n\nNetherlands 0-0 Argentina: 2006 group stage\nBoth sides have defeated Ivory Coast and Serbia &amp; Montenegro in Group C: as a result they have qualified for the knockout stages, with multiple changes made by Marco van Basten and Jos\u00e9 Pekerman. The least memorable World Cup meeting between the nations is the result, although Argentina have the better of it, Carlos Tevez hitting the woodwork and Juan Rom\u00e1n Riquelme shooting narrowly wide a couple of times. The stalemate means Argentina top the group and progress to meet Mexico, while the Netherlands book a last-16 date against Portugal. Had Van Basten and the Netherlands known what awaited in the knockouts they might have tried harder to win the group: the Slag van Neurenberg (Battle of Nuremberg) against Portugal would lead to them being eliminated by Maniche\u2019s solitary goal in a match featuring a record four red cards and 16 yellows.\n\nNetherlands 0-0 Argentina aet (2-4 pens): 2014 semi-final\n\nA renewal of a classic rivalry but far from a classic match. Defences stay in control for 120 minutes of a S\u00e3o Paulo semi-final the Guardian\u2019s match report describes as \u201cwretched\u201d, \u201cdreary\u201d and \u201ca stinker\u201d. Aside from a first-half free-kick hit straight at the goalkeeper, Jasper Cillessen, Lionel Messi is largely kept quiet and the Netherlands winger Arjen Robben is denied by an excellent sliding tackle by Javier Mascherano as full-time approaches. Rodrigo Palacio should win it with five minutes of extra time remaining but tries to head Messi\u2019s bouncing through ball rather than take it on the half-volley. In the Netherlands\u2019 quarter-final penalty shootout victory against Costa Rica Louis van Gaal replaced Cillessen with Tim Krul in the 120th minute. Krul saved two spot-kicks and the decision was recognised as a high-risk managerial masterstroke. This time, however, Van Gaal has used his three permitted substitutes. Argentina\u2019s Sergio Romero saves from Ron Vlaar and Wesley Sneijder, leaving Maxi Rodr\u00edguez to smash a shot through Cillessen\u2019s hands and send Argentina to the final. \u201cI taught Romero how to stop penalties [at AZ Alkmaar],\u201d says Van Gaal. \u201cSo that hurts.\u201d\n"

Bye.\n\n\n\n 1.30pm  \n\nMorocco haven\u2019t yet been seen \u201cat 100%\u201d, their manager, Walid Regragui, reckons. \u201cWe have already achieved great things but we feel it*s not enough, we want to go further,\u201d Regragui told a news conference on Friday.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve already proven all the data analysts wrong about Belgium*s chance and Spain too. They all thought we\u2019d lose to them.\u201d\nHowever, their key defender Nayef Aguerd is a doubt for Saturday\u2019s tie against Portugal after a hamstring injury and other key players, such as the captain, Romain Saiss, and midfielder Sofyan Amrabat, are also carrying injuries.\n\u201dWe\u2019re not going to hide it, we\u2019re tired,\u201d said the coach, who was only handed the job three months before the World Cup. \u201cBut when you go this far in the tournament you have to count on everybody in the squad. So if Nayef cannot play then someone else will have to take his place. We won*t be looking for excuses, we are here on a mission.\n\u201cYou haven\u2019t seen Morocco at 100%, but mentally we are strong,\u201d he added.\n\n\n\n 1.12pm  \n\nSome Portugal news now, from PA Media, as Fernando Santos again had to field plenty of questions about that bloke who started on the bench against Switzerland, and the Portugal manager has called for a stop to \u201cthese polemics\u201d about his selection decisions.\n\nPortugal coach Fernando Santos revealed he had a \u201cfrank conversation\u201d with Cristiano Ronaldo to explain why he was dropping him, but insisted the veteran forward did not threaten to leave the World Cup. Reports in Portugal claim Ronaldo was ready to walk out on his country after learning he would be on the bench for the last-16 clash with Switzerland \u2026 Santos revealed he told Ronaldo he would not be starting on the day of the game, and admitted international football\u2019s record goalscorer took some convincing.\nSantos said: \u201cWe did have a conversation and it would have been very bad if we did not have that conversation. Since I took the helm we needed to talk and have a close relationship with the players, that\u2019s my approach.\n\u201cHe\u2019s the captain of our squad and with what he represents for Portuguese football, for the Portuguese people and the national team, naturally I needed to talk to him. So when we had this conversation it was on match day, after lunch. The only conversation was on that day and I explained why he would not play.\n\u201cWe met and I explained why he would not be one of the starters, so he would not be surprised. In my office, I told him in terms of strategy it is better if you don\u2019t play, I would save him for the second half if need be.\n\u201cCristiano, for obvious reasons, was not very happy about it. He has always been a starting player. He said \u2018do you really think it\u2019s a good idea?\u2019 But we had a normal conversation. I explained my viewpoints, he accepted. We had a frank and normal conversation.\n\u201cHe has never told me he wanted to leave our national team. I think it\u2019s high time we stopped with this conversation and these polemics, because an example of what I just said is what he did during the match. He was warming up with the players even though wasn\u2019t starting. He celebrated all our goals. And at the end he was the one who invited his colleagues to thank the fans. It\u2019s high time to leave it alone.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n 12.59pm  \n\nAnd here\u2019s more on that Lloris presser from Ben Fisher:\n\n\n\n\n 12.54pm  \n\nFraternal pre-match festivities in full swing in Doha \u2026\n\n\n\n\n 12.45pm  \n\nHugo Lloris isn\u2019t underestimating England. The France goalkeeper says he has observed a clear improvement in tomorrow\u2019s opponents. \u201cIf we compare both sides, there were more English players in the World Cup in Russia than French players,\u201d Lloris said, \u201cand if you look at the English squad they were semi-finalists in the World Cup and runner-up at the last Euros.\n\u201cThere is a real progression and I believe this team is getting more mature and ready to compete for trophies. They were a little bit unlucky at the last Euros, they got very close but they are here to win. In our side there are a lot of changes with the new generation of players, they are ready to compete because they play for the best teams in Europe, we have a good mixture.\n\u201cWe have to make sure we will be ready to challenge England on Saturday because it is going to be a big battle.\u201d\n\n\n\n 12.37pm  \n\nThanks Martin, our world domination enterprise starts here. And because Orient\u2019s game at Crewe has been called off we\u2019ll have no choice tomorrow afternoon but to focus on Morocco v Portugal, and there\u2019ll be plenty of attention on Portugal\u2019s hat-trick hero Gon\u00e7alo Ramos. Will Unwin has written about his rise here:\n\nWhen Gon\u00e7alo Ramos moved from his childhood home in the Algarve to Lisbon to join Benfica\u2019s academy as a teenager he struggled to settle, often crying for his parents. His determination to get through the hard times ensured he would make the most of his talent and helped to mould him as a person.\n\n\n\n\n\n 12.33pm  \n\nI am going to hand you over to Tom Davies now for an hour while I take a break \u2013 from one Leyton Orient supporter to another. We are gradually conquering the whole operation.\n\n\n\n 12.24pm  \n\nWhisper it, but England\u2019s record at World Cup quarter-finals isn\u2019t actually that great. The stories in them are though, as Rob Bleaney here runs through all nine of them in a sequence that started with a 4-2 defeat to Uruguay in 1954.\nPerhaps the most telling thing about Gareth Southgate\u2019s England and the way they\u2019ve tried to take the drama out of tournament football and replace it with control, is that the 2018 quarter-final, an unremarkable and comfortable 2-0 win over a Sweden team that historically had been a nuisance to the Three Lions (they went from 1968 to 2011 without recording a single victory against the Swedes in 12 meetings) is the least interesting of the lot.\n\n\n\n\n 12.15pm  \n\nEngland have confirmed that everyone was in training today \u2013 including a returned Raheem Sterling.\n\n\n\n\n 12.13pm  \n\nThe social media bods at Conmebol must be rubbing their hands with a glee at the prospect that by the end of the day we could be in a position where there is a Brazil v Argentina semi-final on the horizon, with guaranteed South American representation in the World Cup final for only the second time in the last five tournaments. 2006, 2010 and 2018 produced all-European finals. To get in the mood, they\u2019ve posted a reminder of how Argentina progressed at the Netherlands\u2019 expense on penalties in 2014.\n\n\n\n\n 11.52am  \n\nA few more words about England from Didier Deschamps here from this morning\u2019s press briefing. \nReuters reports that Deschamps, who has won the World Cup with France as a player and coach, said he did not see many weaknesses in the England team but they did have some \u201cslightly less strong points\u201d.\n\u201cPace is often one of the keys \u2013 when you are quick then the opponents have less time to get organised. But you need more than just pace to score goals,\u201d Deschamps said.\n\u201cYou can stop a lot of things but it is very difficult to stop someone very quick, especially in transitions. England are very strong in transitions \u2013 more than half of their goals have come from quick counterattacks. But they have other qualities too \u2013 they have technical ability, the capacity to score goals and ability on set-pieces.\u201d\n\n\n\n 11.46am  \n\nWe could see some movement in the golden boot table today. Lionel Messi, Richarlison and Cody Gakpo should all feature in the matches, and they are all on three goals behind frontrunner Kylian Mbapp\u00e9, who you might fancy to score against England tomorrow. You can check out the latest table here:\n\n\n\n\n 11.18am  \n\nPhil Foden has been dragged into the Big Brother diary room in the England social media video studio, and admitted that in the past he has broken his nan\u2019s windows a couple of time playing football. He said the experience of scoring for England in a World Cup was \u201csurreal\u201d and \u201cone of the best feelings I\u2019ve ever had in my career\u201d:\n\nIust the moment that Harry [Kane] played that cross in and, you know, my eyes lit up, and I knew that I could just score the chance. Scoring in a World Cup is something I\u2019ve always dreamed of. As a kid, playing in the streets, and you know, people used to say, one day you are going to put on an England shirt and score, and I didn\u2019t really think too much of it. And then, now to say that I\u2019ve done that, is a super surreal moment.\n\nHe also said he was confident going into the match against France, urging England and his teammates to stick to the gameplan:\n\nNo matter the opponent, just stick to what you know, don\u2019t change anything, and stick to the same gameplan. And I feel like everyone\u2019s done that. We know they\u2019ve got great talents, in Mbapp\u00e9 and things, but you know on our day, when we\u2019re playing the football we play, we can hurt any team in the world. So let\u2019s stick into our gameplan and being confident in what we do.\n\n\n\n\n\n 11.07am  \n\nGareth Southgate has cast doubt on whether Raheem Sterling will play a part in England\u2019s World Cup quarter-final with France having only returned to Qatar on Friday, PA reports. It quotes the England coach saying:\n\nWe will have to assess that. He has missed a lot of training and had two long flights. That is not good preparation for a game of this standard but let\u2019s see how he is.\nHe has felt the need to support his family and to be there for his family and that is a simple decision for me \u2013 I have to support the player. I remember Fabian Delph going home, his wife was expecting in Russia. We did the same thing.\nThere are moments for every individual where family becomes most important. I\u2019m always supportive of that. Of course I want the best players available and want to win football matches. But as a manager you have to recognise there are certain moments in people\u2019s lives that are more important at that particular time.\n\n\n\n\n 11.05am  \n\nIt is just gone elevenses in the morning in the UK, so can I tempt you with the some Dutch pastries with Andries Noppert on them for some reason?\n\n\n\n\n 10.56am  \n\nFrom stadiums to markets, the presence of Palestinian flags across Qatar has been hard to miss. Although World Cup organisers have said all along the tournament should not involve politics, it seems the \u201cfree Palestine\u201d cause is being embraced by Qataris, people across the Arab world, as well as some visiting football fans.\nEncounters between Arab football fans and Israeli journalists have gone viral on social media \u2013 along with other clips of an England supporter shouting \u201cfree Palestine\u201d during TV interviews, including one with an Israeli broadcaster.\nThough neither Israel nor Palestine are playing in the tournament, support for Palestine has featured prominently at the Middle East\u2019s first World Cup, as our international correspondent Michael Safi explains in this video.\n\n\n\n\n 10.49am  \n\nFrench coach Didier Deschamps has been up in front of the media circus in Qatar this morning, where he was asked his opinion of his English counterpart Gareth Southgate. He had some rather warm words. Certainly warmer than the words between Louis van Gaal and \u00c1ngel Di Mar\u00eda which have been adding some extra spice to today\u2019s Netherlands v Argentina clash. Deschamps said:\n\nI very much like Gareth. We have met on a number of occasions and have talked about a number of things. Not everyone appreciates him so much in his own country, that isn\u2019t because he wasn\u2019t a good footballer himself \u2013 he had a long and distinguished career and he is also a very good coach. He has enabled England to get some very good results over the years and I very much like him.\n\n\nPA also reports Deschamps was inevitably asked about Kylian Mbapp\u00e9:\n\nI\u2019m sure England will have prepared to face Kylian, as our previous opponents did. But he is in a position to make the difference. Even in the last match when he didn\u2019t have his best match, he didn\u2019t show his top form compared to previous games, he was still decisive.\nWe have other players that can be dangerous as well and that helps us not to be over-dependent on Kylian. But Kylian is Kylian, and he always will be. He has that capacity to make the difference at any moment in the match.\n\n\n\n\n 10.23am  \n\nIf you\u2019d asked me \u201cWhere will the World Cup quarter-final between England and France be won and lost?\u201d I would probably have unhelpfully said \u201cAt Al Bayt Stadium in Al Khor?\u201d and left it at that, such is my tactical insight.\nFortunately, they asked Jonathan Wilson instead \u2026\n\n\n\n\n 10.11am  \n\nEngland might not be playing until tomorrow evening, but we do have some English involvement in today\u2019s quarter-finals. Michael Oliver will be the referee today for Brazil v Croatia at 3pm GMT, and alongside him running the line will be Stuart Burt and Gary Beswick. Oliver previously officiated at Japan v Costa Rica and Saudi Arabia v Mexico in the group stages.\n\n\n\n\n 10.07am  \n\nCroatia have not only bought their parked bus to Qatar, but their massive big flag as well.\n\n\n\n\n 9.49am  \n\nWith the move of the men\u2019s 2022 World Cup to the winter we are only a few months away from the next World Cup \u2013 the women\u2019s competition kicks off in Australia and New Zealand on 20 July 2023. Fifa today have put out their latest updated women\u2019s rankings. No change at the top with USWNT still the team to beat.\n\n\n\n\n 9.22am  \n\nPhilipp Lahm writes his latest column for us today, saying European culture dominates the World Cup but Argentina can teach a tactical lesson:\nFor me, Argentina are the ultimate in this World Cup. All the players have mastered the basic virtue of football: one-on-one, defensively and offensively, aggressively but fairly. These individual skills, which have been lost sight of in the debates about tactics and systems, are what count if you want to win. The Argentinian players show unconditional intensity. They form a unit with the many fans because they see that there is a team on the pitch. You can see why they play football.\nThe coach, Lionel Scaloni, has everything under control. Normally, national teams are less orderly because they rarely train together. But Argentina perform harmoniously like a club team in Champions League form. Their plan: to constantly win the ball and defend forward. It\u2019s a defensive idea, but designed to be proactive. Because Argentina can also keep the ball.\nIn addition, Scaloni has thought about how to integrate the outstanding class of the 35-year-old Lionel Messi. In an interview with the S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung, he told how he deliberately did without Messi at the beginning of his time in charge so the team could find their way without the star. Then he integrated him.\nRead more here: Philipp Lahm \u2013 European culture dominates World Cup but Argentina can teach tactical lesson\n\n\n\n\n 9.19am  \n\nIncidentally Catia emails me to complain about my constant insistence of treating Portugal as Cristiano Ronaldo+Portugal. She says:\n\nAs a Portuguese fan it\u2019s really frustrating that basically all the news reduces one the best international sides in the world to a soap opera around one man. Please stop, we have wonderful players, we have the breakout striker of the World Cup in Ramos, the greatest example of longevity at the highest level of the sport in Pepe, the best blend of creativity and hard work in the Bruno-Bernardo-Felix trio. Portugal is the highest scoring side together with England, provided the biggest thrashing in a World Cup knockout game since who knows when, and everything people talk about is Ronaldo. Enough!\n\nThat\u2019s me told. Maybe someone should tell CR7.\n\n\n\n 9.14am  \n\nThe Fifa website preview of today\u2019s Brazil v Croatia game (3pm GMT) features some quotes from Vinicius Junior. He says:\n\nIt\u2019s going to be a very tough match. They came second in the last World Cup. We\u2019re preparing ourselves to play an excellent match. We\u2019ll give our best in the game like we did against Korea by pressing them and trying to score, which is always very important to us.\n\nHe also deftly handed off the role of doing anything about Luka Modri\u0107, saying:\n\nModri\u0107 is a great player. He\u2019s taught me a lot \u2013 not just on the pitch but off it too. I\u2019m very happy that I know him and that I get to see him every day [at Real Madrid]. Playing against Modri\u0107 is going to be very special. As far as neutralising him goes, I\u2019ll leave that to Casemiro because he can do a better job than me!\n\n\n\n\n\n 8.59am  \n\nI was just having a poke around in the Argentine media ahead of tonight\u2019s clash and was interested to read in Clar\u00edn the general level of unhappiness in the media with Argentina\u2019s set-up.\nAdrian Maladesky writes that coach Lionel Scaloni\u2019s questioning of the way the press were reporting on the team called into question whether they were for Argentina or for the Netherlands \u201csuggests returning to a request for complicity with the press that not only goes against what journalism should do but also shows that the national team is unaware of how badly they handle communication.\u201d\nHe goes on to say \u201cFor a long time, the national team seems stubborn in not understanding the role of the press, which, given the closed training sessions, the lack of official information or any conferences that are not mandatory by Fifa, are pushed to seek alternative sources.\u201d\nIt all sounds a bit Fabio Capello-era England, and we know how that went.\n\n\n\n 8.36am  \n\nSean Ingle is in Doha for the Guardian and writes for us today on how England coach Gareth Southgate has included learnings from other sporting disciplines in his approach to coaching the national side:\nA key member of Southgate\u2019s setup has been the New Zealander performance coach Owen Eastwood, who has also worked with South Africa\u2019s cricketers, his homeland\u2019s rugby team and Team GB. Eastwood emphasises the concept of Whakapapa \u2013 the M\u0101ori way of explaining your place in any tribe or family. Applied to sport, it places the emphasis on creating pride in the shirt and leaving a legacy for others to follow.\nEastwood also stresses that trust and openness matter. \u201cPeople thrive when there\u2019s consistency and composure around the environment,\u201d he says. \u201cOne of the things about Gareth\u2019s leadership is he genuinely sees it as a players\u2019 game. He is there to facilitate them achieving what their potential might be. It\u2019s not about him. He\u2019s not the hero of it \u2013 the players are the heroes of it.\u201d\nIt is a philosophy similar to that of Danny Kerry, who guided the GB women\u2019s hockey team to gold at the Rio 2016 Olympics and has also spoken to Southgate. One of the team\u2019s stars, Georgie Twigg, says that there are clear parallels with what the hockey team did and what she sees with England\u2019s players in Doha.\n\u201cWe worked very closely with psychologists on what we, as a team, wanted our culture to look like: how we wanted to behave and hold each other to account,\u201d she says. \u201cWe had to because we were a group of 30 girls training day in, day out, with massively different personalities and ages.\u201d\nRead more here: Sean Ingle \u2013 Education and listening helping Southgate shape his happy England\n\n\n\n\n 8.29am  \n\nGary Lineker has clearly enjoyed this potted history of West Germany and Germany stomping through World Cup history and breaking hearts, and I suspect you will too. It has subtitles so you don\u2019t even have to put the sound up, although it is funnier if you do.\n\n\n\n\n 8.24am  \n\nYoussouf Fofana came across as very funny in France\u2019s media round yesterday, not least when he was asked about Kyle Walker\u2019s prospects of stopping Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 on Saturday evening.\nWalker had said \u201cwe respect that he is a good player in good form at the minute, but I am not going to roll out a red carpet for him and tell him to go and score.\u201d\nReuters quotes Fofana responding \u201cHats off to him. If he can stop Kylian, good for him. But there\u2019s 19 other teams in the French league that are waiting for the answer of how to stop Kylian, and the truth is on the pitch.\u201d\n\nFofana was also asked about the atmosphere in the French camp \u2013 not always traditionally the most happy of dressing rooms. \u201cThe atmosphere is tense, tense, tense,\u201d he joked.\n\u201cNo, I\u2019m joking,\u201d he went on. \u201cWe can wear headphones, so if we don\u2019t like the chosen music for the group, then we can listen to our own music.\u201d\n\n\nUpdated at 9.07am GMT\n\n\n 8.18am  \n\nHere are some very impressive behind-the-scenes drone shots of the Education City stadium where Brazil and Croatia will face each other later today.\n\nNot included in the tour, a chief executive of the Qatar World Cup saying \u201cdeath is a natural part of life \u2013 whether it\u2019s at work, whether it\u2019s in your sleep.\u201d\n\n\n\n 8.11am  \n\nLet us start with a look ahead to Morocco\u2019s historic meeting with portugal tomorrow. Ed Aarons writes for us on how they aim to break new ground after previous African heartbreaks at this stage of the tournament:\nIt is fitting the Atlas Lions will be the next to try their luck in reaching the semi-finals given Morocco became the first African side to pick up a point, at the 1970 World Cup. While Zaire \u2013 sub-Saharan Africa\u2019s first representatives \u2013 were humbled 9-0 by Yugoslavia at the next World Cup, it looked as if Pel\u00e9 might have been on to something when Tunisia became the first African side to record a victory at the tournament in 1978 with a 3-1 win over Mexico. Four years later, Algeria shocked the world by defeating West Germany.\nBut after Gary Lineker broke Cameroon\u2019s hearts at Italia 90 and despite Nigeria claiming Africa\u2019s first gold medal in men\u2019s football at the 1996 Olympics, it would be another 12 years until an African side cracked the last eight again.\nSenegal\u2019s triumph thanks to Henri Camara\u2019s golden goal in extra time in the second round against Sweden \u2013 having already seen off the reigning champions, France \u2013 meant most people expected them to defeat Turkey in the quarter-finals. But substitute Ilhan Mansiz scored another golden goal in the fourth minute of extra time \u2013 the last before the rule was scrapped by Fifa \u2013 after a drab 90 minutes to deny them a place in the last four.\nIt was Ghana\u2019s turn eight years later at the first World Cup on African soil. Had it not been for Luis Su\u00e1rez\u2019s infamous handball to deny Dominic Adiyiah\u2019s goal-bound header and Asamoah Gyan\u2019s subsequent penalty miss at Soccer City in Johannesburg then the Black Stars would have played the Netherlands in the semi-finals. And so to Qatar. Morocco\u2019s players will carry not only the hopes and dreams of Africa when they face Portugal but of the Arab world as well.\nRead more here: Ed Aarons \u2013 Morocco aim to break new ground for Africa after World Cup heartbreaks\n\n\n\n\n 8.06am  \n\nIt does seem slightly mad that we are nine days away from a World Cup final and also about twelve days away from the resumption of the top European club football season, but here we are. Paris St Germain president Nasser Al-Khelaifi has said Lionel Messi is happy at the Ligue 1 champions and they will open discussions about a possible contract extension after the World Cup, Reuters reports.\nMessi, who has 12 goals and 14 assists for PSG in all competitions this season, moved to PSG from Barcelona in 2021 on a two-year contract, which expires in the summer.\nWhen asked if the 35-year-old is interested in extending his stay in Paris, Al-Khelaifi told Sky Sports, \u201cdefinitely\u201d.\n\u201cHe performed fantastic this season for us, he\u2019s scored a lot of goals and assists for the national team and for the club,\u201d he added.\n\u201cSo what we agreed together \u2013 that after the World Cup, sit down together. But both sides \u2013 our side of the club and him \u2013 are very happy, so we will talk after the World Cup.\u201d\n\n\n\n 8.00am  \nPreamble\n\nWorld Cup football is back, back, back. Yes, after two whole days without a game, we have got two cracking quarter-finals in store.\nAt 3pm GMT, Brazil will surely go into their match with Croatia thinking they\u2019ve got more than enough of a dancing front line to progress. But the Croats are nothing if not stubborn, they\u2019ve never lost a quarter-final, and they\u2019ve taken four of their last World Cup knockout matches beyond 90 minutes and prevailed every time. Can they keep the sele\u00e7\u00e3o at bay?\nThen at 7pm GMT, evoking memories of the 1978 final and 2014 semi-final, it is one of the all-time great World Cup match ups: Netherlands v Argentina. Can Messi get closer to that elusive winner\u2019s medal, or will Louis van Gaal\u2019s wily tactics give the Dutch the upper hand?\nBy the end of the day we could be facing the mouth-watering prospect of a Brazil v Argentina semi-final. Or Croatia and the Netherlands, two teams who have reached the World Cup final before but never lifted the trophy could be marching on. I cannot wait.\nBefore then we\u2019ll have all the build up to those games, news from the Morocco, England, France and Cristiano Ronaldo camps ahead of their turn tomorrow, and time for plenty of chit-chat and idle speculation.

                    "body": "Gareth Southgate says it is vital that sections of England\u2019s support are given stronger assurances about their safety at the World Cup in Qatar, and that it will be \u201chorrible\u201d if people feel unable to travel because of human rights concerns. Among the many issues clouding this winter\u2019s tournament is the fact that homosexuality is illegal in Qatar, while there are also serious problems surrounding women\u2019s rights. While officials in the country have repeatedly stated that all supporters will be safe, there remains significant disquiet. Southgate explained that he has researched the problems that have caused alarm since Qatar was awarded hosting rights in 2010.  \u201cI think I\u2019m quite clear on the areas of concern about this tournament,\u201d he said. \u201cThe building of the stadiums was the first, and there\u2019s nothing we can do about that now. They\u2019re built. There are obviously ongoing concerns about the rights of workers and the conditions they live in and those areas. It seems universally accepted that\u2019s better than it was, but not in the position where people think it could be. And maybe policies that have been put in place are not always enforced as they might be. \u201cThen there are the issues that potentially threaten our fans when they travel: the rights of women and the rights of the LGBTQ+ community in particular. Sadly, through discussions that I\u2019ve had, I don\u2019t think some of those communities are going to go and that\u2019s a great shame. \u201cWe stand for inclusivity as a team \u2013 that\u2019s been the big driver of a lot of the stances we\u2019ve taken in the last couple of years \u2013 and it would be horrible to think some of our fans feel they can\u2019t go because they feel threatened or they\u2019re worried about their safety. So there needs to be some clarity and some better communication that they are going to be safe, because they\u2019re not feeling that.\u201d Southgate said his squad, who will face Switzerland and Ivory Coast in friendlies during the forthcoming international break, will be apprised of these issues in particular. \u201cWhat we\u2019re going to try to do with the players is highlight that we think those are going to be the key areas,\u201d he said. \u201cThere might be one or two others too.\u201d  The nature of any stand England might make to raise awareness, whether in Qatar or before, remains open to discussion. Denmark are displaying messages critical of Qatar on their training kit and reducing commercial activity around the event; Southgate said any display has to be meaningful but that there is also a limit to what he and his players can do, although talks are continuing. \u201cI\u2019m not sure that just wearing a T-shirt makes a difference,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t totally know what we can do in every aspect. I think we have to be realistic about what that might be. There are some things we\u2019re not going to be able to affect. Maybe there are some things we can affect; if we can and we think they\u2019re worthwhile, we\u2019ll try to do that. Without a doubt, one of the priorities in my mind is our own fans and how they\u2019re going to be dealt with in particular. \u201cDespite contradictory reports we are in regular contact with the NGOs. There are lots of conversations with organisations like Amnesty, so it\u2019s not correct when they say discussions aren\u2019t taking place. We\u2019re trying to do the best we can. We\u2019re going to get criticism here whatever happens. It won\u2019t be deemed enough but we have always tried to affect things in the right way.\u201d  On the pitch Southgate is heartened by the fact that Harry Kane, whose form earlier in the season was a concern, is close to his best again. The England captain has scored seven in as many games at club level, suggesting he has shaken off any malaise brought about by his failed attempt to leave Tottenham last summer. \u201cIt\u2019s been good to see Harry scoring,\u201d Southgate said. \u201cHe\u2019s always a happier animal when he comes in if he\u2019s been scoring. Physically, the way Antonio [Conte] works and trains the team, I think that will have been good for Harry, to help get the best level out of him.\u201d"

                    "body": "To celebrate Argentina\u2019s World Cup victory eight days ago, today\u2019s puzzles are set by Rodolfo Kurchan, an internationally renowned puzzle inventor and author from Buenos Aires. 1. Messi maths Replace the ten letters of the following sum with the ten digits 0,1,2, \u2026 9, such that the sum is correct. Each letter represents a unique digit. There are two solutions, so find the one with the largest MESSI.  2. A game of four parts For each of the five tasks below, you must divide a square into four parts that have the same shape, but whose sizes are determined by the following statements: i) All four shapes are the same size. ii) Only three are the same size. iii) Two are the same size, and the other two are also the same size (but a different size from the first two). iv) Two are the same size, and the other two are different sizes. v) No two parts are the same size. Here\u2019s a solution for the first one. The square is divided into four triangles that are the same shape, and the same size.  For clarification: within each solution, the four parts must have the same shape. It is only their sizes that may change. However, each solution may involve a different shape. One solution fits perfectly along the lines of a 12 x 12 square, one on a 10x10 square, and one involves triangles. Note: the fifth one is extremely difficult. Come back for the answer later. 3. Snake paths Your goal in this puzzle is to create a path of digits in a 5x5 grid that goes 1,2,3,4,5 and then repeats the digits in a loop. The path can start in any cell, and moves horizontally or vertically, but never diagonally, and cannot cross itself. Digits cannot repeat in the same row or column (just like Sudoku). Here\u2019s an example of a path of length 12.  Can you find a path that has length 19, the maximum possible? Extra challenge: What is the longest path you can make in a 7x7 grid starting with 1 and then repeating the numbers once you get to 7? I\u2019ll be back at 5pm UK with the solutions. PLEASE NO SPOILERS (although giving tips and hints is fine). UPDATE: solutions can be read here. Thanks to Rodolfo for supplying today\u2019s puzzles. To find out more about him here\u2019s his website, and if you are strolling down Buenos Aires you can visit his philately shop. Finally, festive best wishes to everyone who reads these puzzles. This year, the column received 4 million page views, almost double the amount it received in 2021. In keeping with the journalistic tradition of \u2018best of the year\u2019 lists, the three most popular posts were this one about Elon Musk, this one about engineering, and this Oxford university admissions question. Thanks to everyone who has enjoyed the puzzles, corrected my mistakes and sent in suggestions. Keep them coming, and see you in 2023! I set a puzzle here every two weeks on a Monday. I\u2019m always on the look-out for great puzzles. If you would like to suggest one, email me. I give school talks about maths and puzzles (online and in person). If your school is interested please get in touch."

                    "body": "\nPrince Andrew, Boris Johnson and the prime minister of Qatar gazed through rain-spattered glass on to the streets of London far below as they celebrated the opening of Britain\u2019s tallest building, the Shard.\nFor Johnson, then mayor of London, the unseasonably cold July day in 2012 symbolised London\u2019s resurgence after the devastation of the global financial crisis.\nPrince Andrew marked the occasion by abseiling down a section of the 310-metre tower for charity, saying afterwards that he had easily overcome the \u201cpsychobabble\u201d about fear of heights.\nBut the day was perhaps most auspicious for Hamad bin Jassim bin Jaber al-Thani, known colloquially as HBJ. The great steel-and-glass edifice that now loomed over Britain\u2019s capital had been built with nearly \u00a32bn of Qatari investment.\nThe building served as a totem for a strategy that he pioneered: Qatar \u2013 a British protectorate from 1916 to 1971 \u2013 was deploying its vast oil-and-gas wealth to buy huge chunks of the nation that once ruled over it.\nAs an Observer audit now reveals today, the Qataris\u2019 British property empire has ballooned since then into a sprawling portfolio likely to be worth in excess of \u00a310bn.\n\nQatar and the vast al-Thani clan that rules it have played a real-life game of Monopoly, scooping up trophy assets such as hotels on Mayfair and Park Lane \u2013 not to mention properties on Pall Mall, Oxford Street, Bond Street and Vine Street. Prize purchases include ultra-high-end hotels such as the Ritz and Claridge\u2019s, the international finance hub at Canary Wharf, not to mention luxury personal retreats, including rural idylls and London mansions.\nBut analysis of more than 4,000 land titles shows that Qatar and the al-Thanis\u2019 British interests are larger and more diverse than previously thought, also taking in unglamorous industrial estates, modest seaside hotels and terraced houses in Bootle and Runcorn.\nThe state of Qatar alone, not counting individual royals\u2019 personal holdings, is the 10th largest landowner in the UK, according to analysts at MSCI Real Assets. The emirate owns nearly 2.1m sq metres (23m sq feet) of property in Britain, more than 1.5 times the area of London\u2019s Hyde Park.\nMany of the properties are owned through Jersey, the British Virgin Islands or the Cayman Islands, meaning ownership is often difficult to determine via public disclosures.\nHarrods and luxury retail\nWhen Qatar won the right to host this year\u2019s World Cup, in December 2010, it was not that year\u2019s first major coup for the emirate.\nSeven months earlier, an investment arm of its sovereign wealth fund, the Qatar Investment Authority (QIA), had paid Egyptian-born billionaire Mohamed Al Fayed more than \u00a31.5bn for the world-famous Harrods department store, including the imposing two-hectare Knightsbridge premises it has occupied since 1849.\nBoth were victories for HBJ, who was three years into his tenure as prime minister and spearheading a nascent global investment spree. He did so with the blessing of his ally, the then emir, Hamad bin Khalifa (or HBK), who was developing a taste for luxury retail.\nIn the years that followed, via the Doha-based investment vehicle Mayhoola, HBK spent nearly \u00a31bn buying the European fashion houses Valentino, Balmain and Pal Zileri, including their outlets on Bond Street and Sloane Street.\nFive-star hotels\nEven these salubrious addresses pale in comparison with Qatar\u2019s portfolio of top London hotels.\nThe Ritz, the Savoy, Claridge\u2019s, the Connaught, the Berkeley, the Churchill and the InterContinental Park Lane are all either wholly, or partly owned by Qatari royals or \u2013 in the case of the Ritz \u2013 by the current emir\u2019s brother-in-law.\nThree, including Claridge\u2019s, are owned, via two Luxembourg-based entities, by Maybourne Hotel Group, whose ultimate controlling parties are registered at Companies House as HBK and HBJ.\nThe value of Maybourne is subject to a bitter legal dispute between HBJ and the hotelier Paddy McKillen, who claims the Qataris are wrongfully trying to do him out of his share of an uplift in value created by a \u00a3800m renovation he oversaw. Although the Qataris dispute the figure, McKillen argues the Maybourne clutch of hotels, thanks to his work, is worth more than \u00a35bn.\nThe emir of Qatar\u2019s brother-in-law paid \u00a3700m for the Ritz while the InterContinental was a \u00a3400m purchase for Constellation Hotels, ultimately owned by the QIA, in 2013. The value of the state-owned Katara Hospitality\u2019s 50% share in the Savoy \u2013 in partnership with Saudi billionaire Prince Alwaleed bin Talal \u2013 is undisclosed.\n\nLuxury mansions\nThe al-Thani clan also owns more than a dozen of the largest and most lavishly appointed homes in London. Observer analysis suggests their combined residential property portfolio is worth at least \u00a31.5bn.\nA sizable chunk of that is accounted for by HBJ\u2019s properties, including a \u00a3100m penthouse at the One Hyde Park development in Knightsbridge and Forbes House, a six-storey Georgian mansion in Belgravia, which HBJ reportedly paid \u00a3150m for in 2018. The former is owned by a company in the Cayman Islands, the latter by a firm in the British Virgin Islands.\nHBJ won a key breakthrough in 2020, when he defeated conservationists who opposed his plans to remove a vast double staircase in the mansion. Victory means he can go ahead and install 25 bedrooms, a cinema, a library, a sauna, a Turkish bath and parking for 32 vehicles, potentially turning the house into London\u2019s first \u00a3300m property.\nNot far away, in Mayfair, is the area known as Little Doha, after the emirate\u2019s capital, due to its concentration of multimillion-pound Qatari-owned homes and offices.\nOne of the most celebrated is Dudley House on Park Lane, a 4,000 sq metre palace that Queen Elizabeth II reportedly said made Buckingham Palace look \u201crather dull\u201d by comparison.\nIt was purchased in 2006 through a company called Bristol Isles Ltd, based in the Bahamas, and restored under the discerning eye of its resident, Hamad bin Abdullah al-Thani, a cousin of the emir.\nThe Pandora Papers leak \u2013 shared with the Guardian by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists in 2021 \u2013 revealed that Sheikha Moza bint Nasser, mother of the current emir and wife to HBK, bought two of London\u2019s most expensive properties, on Cornwall Terrace in north London, for \u00a3120m in 2013.\nDocuments from the leak also suggested that the structure of the purchase, using layers of offshore companies based in tax havens, legitimately reduced stamp duty payable on the mansions by \u00a318.5m.\nThose two properties overlook leafy Regent\u2019s Park but the quiet of the countryside appears to be appealing, too. One member of the family, Mohamed Khalifa al-Thani, has bought four plots of land at a luxury rural development in southern England that has found favour with celebrities.\nBut that is a relatively rare foray outside the capital for the Qatari royals, who own at least 30 London properties with an individual value of \u00a310m or more, including mansions dotted around Mayfair, Belgravia and Knightsbridge.\nTheir wrought iron railings and beautiful facades are a world away from the gleaming towers of the City and Canary Wharf \u2013 but Qatar owns many of those too.\nUrban developments\nIt took almost \u00a32bn of Qatari state cash to build the Shard and the emirate still owns the bulk of the Shard Quarter in London Bridge, including the nearby News Building, occupied by Rupert Murdoch\u2019s News UK, owner of the Sun, the Times and the Sunday Times.\nTwo years after the tower\u2019s completion, the QIA aimed high again, buying HSBC\u2019s headquarters at 8 Canada Square in Docklands for \u00a31.1bn. It swiftly followed that up by leading a consortium that bought Canary Wharf Group in a \u00a32.6bn takeover. The group\u2019s flagship property is One Canada Square, the UK\u2019s third-tallest building and a symbol of British high finance. In Tower Hamlets, the borough that includes Canary Wharf, the Qatari state holds 200 land titles, according to MSCI Real Assets.\nBut thousands of ordinary people, not just in London, unwittingly buy and rent property from Qatar, courtesy of its real estate development business. Qatari Diar, owned by the QIA, is a major partner in a string of massive urban regeneration projects and it jointly owns thousands of land titles as a result.\nIn London, it has already finished Chelsea Barracks, the US embassy and the Olympic village, and is in the process of transforming Elephant and Castle, with plans afoot for Lewisham Gateway.\n\nIt is also behind projects at New Maker Yards in Salford, Merchant City in Glasgow and an area of Leeds that Companies House filings suggest could be named the Holbeck Quarter.\nAll in all, Land Registry data shows that companies part-owned by Qatari Diar hold 4,000 land titles, including hundreds owned via the British Virgin Islands. Records suggest the titles cost \u00a32bn at the time of purchase but the current value is likely to be significantly higher.\nThe smaller scale\nSome Qatari investments in the UK are rather less grand, particularly those owned by lesser-known members of the sprawling al-Thani clan with their own business interests.\nMore than 20 of the properties identified by the Observer are owned by Earth Creation, a company whose controlling party is one 30-year-old Hamad Saoud al-Thani.\nIts latest accounts, for 2020, show that Earth Creation\u2019s property investments increased in value from \u00a312m to \u00a321m, apparently funded by a loan from Hamad Saoud, whose father was a prominent art collector.\nLand Registry records suggest that Hamad Saoud\u2019s portfolio of UK property includes homes bought in Runcorn, Eccles, Bootle and Liverpool for as little as \u00a365,000.\nEarth Creation is registered to an address in London\u2019s Covent Garden that also houses Messery Limited, owned by another family member, Hamad Nasser al-Thani.\nThis business owns property on industrial estates and business parks in Swindon, Rochdale, Nottingham and Wigan.\nAnd in Bournemouth, one Abdulla Qassim al-Thani owns nine properties including half a dozen hotels. Between them, Land Registry titles suggest, they are worth one twenty-fifth of the Ritz."

                    "body": "The owner of the gambling brands Ladbrokes and Coral has raised its annual profit forecast after it benefited from customers betting on the men\u2019s football World Cup. Entain said it had seen a record number of customers in the final three months of 2022, an increase of 14% compared with a year earlier. Despite the boost from the tournament, which took place in Qatar in November and December, Entain said this was slightly offset by disruption to some sports fixtures because of wintry weather. The company, which owns betting shops as well as the bwin and partypoker online brands, said its total net gaming revenues rose by 11% between October and December, compared with a year earlier. As a result, Entain said it expected to make a pre-tax profit of between \u00a3985m and \u00a3995m for the full year. This was up from a previous forecasts of between \u00a3925m and \u00a3975m, which would mean an increase in profit of about 12%, compared with a year earlier. Online net gaming revenues climbed by 12% in the final quarter, compared with a year earlier. However, the company said its full-year online net gaming revenues fell by 1% year on year as it was affected by regulatory changes in the UK and Germany. At its Ladbrokes and Coral betting shops, Entain said its retail net gaming revenues were 66% higher for the year, with volumes above pre-pandemic levels. Investors reacted positively to the trading update, with Entain shares up more than 2% on the FTSE 100 at lunchtime on Wednesday. Entain said it had been successful in its attempts to widen its appeal to customers. Jette Nygaard-Andersen, its chief executive, said the company had experienced \u201cstrong financial, operational and strategic progress\u201d in 2022. Entain said it had started 2023 with \u201cgood momentum\u201d and it was confident growth would continue. The results come less than six months after the company was told by the Gambling Commission to pay a record \u00a317m settlement over failings at its retail and online businesses to follow rules to tackle addiction and prevent money laundering."

                    "body": "At the end of the 1962-63 season George Cohen was selected for a short England Under-23 tour of eastern Europe. When it ended he had played eight out of 21 Under-23 fixtures over nearly four years, never quite establishing his place in the side, and was about to turn 24. It was, he concluded, the end of his international career. \u201cThat\u2019s me, finished,\u201d he announced. Within a year he was in the senior side. \u201cHow wrong he was,\u201d Alf Ramsey later said of the defender, who has died aged 83. \u201cHe had all the qualities required of an international player, particularly in defence. He was a serious-minded young man, dedicated to his task. Playing against him must have been a very frustrating experience.\u201d  Ramsey first called on Cohen to replace the injured captain, Jimmy Armfield, in a game against Uruguay in 1964. The Guardian reported that he \u201crecovered from a somewhat shaky start to give a creditable performance\u201d but Ramsey liked what he saw, and Armfield was to play only twice more. \u201cFrankly, if Ramsey had not been manager, I don\u2019t think I\u2019d have got a smell,\u201d said Cohen of international football. \u201cI wasn\u2019t a natural footballer. I had to work at a lot of things, but I knew my asset was my strength and speed. \u201cAlthough I used to get forward a lot, defending was my forte. I could tackle, and read the game reasonably well. Alf only asked you to do what you were capable of doing. I liked to get forward, and the lads used to tease me about my crosses being more dangerous to the crowd than our opponents, but primarily I thought I was a good defender in a back four where we all knew our jobs.\u201d Cohen had been a teenage winger, before his first Fulham manager, Dugald Livingstone, himself a former full-back, relocated him to the right side of defence. \u201cFootball is a game of movement, it\u2019s about width and depth and it was with Dugald that I learned about positional play as a defender,\u201d he said. \u201cHe taught me about things like overlaps and how to run on to balls, keeping the game fluid, rather than waiting to receive the ball. They were lessons that stayed with me.\u201d Cohen\u2019s club career lasted approximately a decade, all of it spent at Fulham, and was bookended by meetings with Liverpool \u2013 he made his debut against them in March 1957, aged 17, and it was against the same side in December 1967, in a tackle with his occasional England teammate Peter Thompson, that he sustained the knee cartilage injury that would force his retirement, 15 months and several failed comebacks later. He was unique in the 1966 England team in never winning a club honour: with him in the side Fulham won promotion to the top flight and reached two FA Cup semi-finals, but there was no trophy, and no league finish higher than 10th (tellingly within two years of Cohen\u2019s injury they had been relegated twice, and they did not return to the top flight until 2001). If he was perhaps the least illustrious member of England\u2019s most glorious team, his value was nevertheless clear. \u201cThere were so many examples of superb professionalism in the team but none of them surpassed the one presented by George Cohen,\u201d his great friend Bobby Charlton wrote. \u201cJust seeing him on the bus, always amiable, always willing to lend a helping hand on or off the field, was enough to create a wave of wellbeing.\u201d  His teammates delighted in his idiosyncrasies: the way he almost always had a book in his hands, normally open; his habit of showering before matches, and then launching into a solo warmup drill of push-ups and some enthusiastic running on the spot. \u201cI thought I was a keen trainer,\u201d said Geoff Hurst, \u201cbut George left us all cold. He was a fanatic for fitness.\u201d His commitment to both the team and his own individuality made Charlton consider him \u201cthe very essence of what Alf was trying to achieve\u201d. Alan Ball, who operated ahead of Cohen on the right side of midfield, wrote in his autobiography: \u201cI loved and adored him and still do. He was as strong as a bull and \u2026 Alf knew that, together, we would bottle up that entire side of the pitch. George was not the greatest passer of the ball, but he was a powerhouse. Nobody ever went past him, nobody could beat him for pace, but when he went off on his runs we never quite knew where the ball was going to end up.\u201d  If Cohen\u2019s playing style was characterised by power and indefatigable spirit, he needed those qualities away from the game. His parents died when he was a young man, his father of lung cancer, his mother after being run over by a truck, and his younger brother Peter, father of the rugby union World Cup winner Ben \u2013 it was not until the 2019 cricket competition that England won a World Cup in a major men\u2019s team sport without a member of the Cohen family in the side \u2013 was killed in 2000 after he was set upon by three men he was attempting to eject from a nightclub he owned in Northampton. He himself retired at 29, and in 1976, aged 36, was diagnosed with bowel cancer \u2013 the disease that was to strike his older brother Len, and to kill his World Cup-winning captain, Bobby Moore. Despite apparently successful treatment the cancer returned in 1978, and again in 1980. Aged only 41, the radiotherapy he received was so intense that he was left unable to walk without a stick. He was eventually declared cancer-free in 1990, and returned to the property development to which he had dedicated himself after football. In 1998 he sold his World Cup medal to help fund his retirement \u2013 it was bought by Fulham for \u00a380,000 \u2013 and soon after came another significant taste of misfortune when a failed property deal brought him to the brink of bankruptcy, forcing him to sell his family home. He then wrote an autobiography, which describes with equal equanimity events ranging from glory to calamity and colostomy, only for his publisher to go bust, taking much of his money with them. Through it all he remained, at least in public, permanently cheerful; his wife, Daphne, whom he met aged 19 and married at 23, was his life\u2019s other great constant. Among the things he always kept hold of was a photograph of him challenging George Best, signed by the former Manchester United winger and dedicated to \u201cthe best full-back I ever played against\u201d. But the words that perhaps summed him up best are inscribed at the foot of his statue, unveiled outside Craven Cottage in 2016: \u201cFulham player. World Cup winner. Gentleman.\u201d"

                    "body": "With six months until Senegal take on the Netherlands at the Al Thumama Stadium in the opening game, uncertainty hangs over the World Cup in Qatar. It extends beyond fears over human rights to practical concerns: how many fans will attend the tournament? And what kind of experience will they have there? The first question is the most pressing and the answer not definitive. Signs do seem to be pointing in a clear direction, however, and a carnival of global football fans in the Gulf looks unlikely. At the time of writing, Fifa has sold 800,000 match tickets to fans. This, from a capacity of 3.1m seats, is just over a quarter of the total. In Russia four years ago, 2.5m tickets were sold to fans from a capacity of slightly more than 3m. There is some way to go if organisers hope to match, or even get close to, that total.  At the end of this month Fifa will reveal the results of its second tranche of sales. The governing body publicised the fact that it received 23.5m ticket requests as part of that process but observers note it does not commit anyone to a purchase and that tickets for knockout matches can be sold several times, with ticket holders whose teams are knocked out along the way refunded. Reports from different countries seem to back up the bigger picture. England have not sold out their allocation for their group games or prospective knockout fixtures. Only the match against (potentially) Scotland or Wales has got close, with two of three ticket categories oversubscribed. Reports from France suggest their travelling support is going to be less than a quarter of what it was in Russia. For those involved, obtaining a ticket kickstarts a second period of uncertainty. Only once you have a ticket can you apply to the Qatari government for a permit to enter the country, known as a \u201cHayya Card\u201d. You cannot book a flight before then and must visit the Qatar Accommodation Agency to find a place to stay. Since it launched its online portal in March there has been confusion as to what kind of rooms are available and at what price.  The hunt for promised $80-per-night accommodation is often fruitless, unprepossessing \u201cFan Village Cabins\u201d start at $200 a night, and AirBnB-style apartments come in at about $1,000. To what extent these options will be refreshed once the second stage of sales is confirmed remains unclear. Calculations by Football Supporters Europe predict that this will be the most expensive World Cup for travelling fans by some margin. Its figures suggest a cost of \u20ac2,770 for staying for three group matches, compared with \u20ac1,000 during Russia 2018. To stay for the whole tournament will be more like \u20ac6,500, it says. \u201cIt\u2019s clearly difficult for most fans to know how expensive the World Cup is going to be for them,\u201d says FSE\u2019s CEO, Ronan Evain. \u201cTo book flights or a hotel you need the tickets first, so you need to pay to know how much it is going to cost. There is a consistent lack of information about the process and what there is is difficult to understand; nothing is written clearly on paper. It feels like Fifa and Qatar are doing their best to persuade people not to go.\u201d There is a cheap category of tickets available only to locals, and fans flying in from neighbouring countries is also a possibility, though unlikely for every fixture (and flights from Jeddah in Saudi Arabia to Doha to watch Belgium v Canada would still start at \u00a3500 return). The Qatari Supreme Committee for Delivery and Legacy, responsible for organising the tournament, remains confident of staging an event that will attract global interest. \u201cWe expect to welcome more than 1 million visitors throughout the duration of the tournament,\u201d a spokesperson said. \u201cThe host country will deliver up to 130,000 rooms, which equates to 3.6m room nights. With six months until kick-off, Qatar is on track to ensure football fans from all over the world can book a wide range of unique and affordable accommodation options. There is no concern that demand could outstrip supply.\u201d  What fans will do in Qatar is also to be confirmed. Expectations were of two grand fan parks that, crucially, would be licensed to sell alcohol. Those plans, according to the Supreme Committee, are continuing, with more information \u201cin due course\u201d. The spokesperson said: \u201cFans will be able to enjoy Qatar\u2019s world-leading museums and traditional souqs, feast on traditional street food and make the most of the beaches and desert adventures.\u201d"

Australia\u2019s first-choice right-back came off the bench for Olympique Lyonnais with her club side 5-0 up against Rodez in a French cup match over the weekend and came through the half-hour appearance unscathed.  Lyon ran out 8-0 winners and Carpenter, who sustained the injury in last season\u2019s Women\u2019s Champions League final against Barcelona, said she was glad to be back in action with just over five months to go before the Matildas kick off their World Cup campaign. \u201cVery proud and grateful to be back,\u201d she tweeted. \u201cI have learned a lot during these months about myself. The ones who have been there since day one. Thank you, my support system has been second to none. Would not be here without you guys. I\u2019m just getting started.\u201d Carpenter\u2019s return to fitness came too late to be included in Australia\u2019s squad for the upcoming Cup of Nations announced last week, but will nevertheless be a fillip for coach Tony Gustavsson. The 22-year-old is one of the first names on the Matildas team sheet and has been a mainstay in the side since making her debut as a 15-year-old in 2016. She has developed into one of the best defenders in the world but is facing a race to be fit in time for the World Cup opener against Ireland at Sydney\u2019s Accor Stadium on 20 July. Carpenter underwent surgery on her knee in May after suffering the injury 13 minutes into Lyon\u2019s 3-1 victory in Turin. She left the pitch in tears on a stretcher, but returned later in the night to celebrate with her teammates on crutches and with her leg in a brace."

                    "body": "Chelsea are lining up a move for Brighton\u2019s Mois\u00e9s Caicedo after encountering frustration in attempts to bolster their midfield by signing Benfica\u2019s Enzo Fern\u00e1ndez. With N\u2019Golo Kant\u00e9 out with a long-term hamstring injury and uncertainty over Jorginho\u2019s future, Graham Potter is prioritising a midfielder. Chelsea have been in talks with Benfica over Fern\u00e1ndez but are looking at alternatives after failing to agree a fee for the Argentina international.  The search has led to Chelsea, who added depth in attack by signing Atl\u00e9tico Madrid\u2019s Jo\u00e3o F\u00e9lix on loan this week, looking at two Brighton players. They are interested in Alexis Mac Allister, though a deal for Caicedo could be more achievable. Chelsea are big admirers of Caicedo, who was coached by Potter at Brighton, and are weighing up a bid for the Ecuadorian. There is an awareness that signing Mac Allister could be difficult given Brighton recently handed the Argentina World Cup winner a new deal. It is likely Brighton will try to keep Caicedo, who is also a target for Liverpool. Roberto De Zerbi\u2019s side are pushing for European qualification and will be keen not to lose any big players. Brighton also demonstrated they are no pushovers in the transfer market when they made Chelsea pay \u00a362m for Marc Cucurella last summer.. The left-back has struggled and that could be an argument against Chelsea trying to take another individual from Brighton \u2013 along with hiring Potter as head coach, they poached Kyle Macaulay and Paul Winstanley from the club\u2019s recruitment department. Equally, Caicedo has settled well since joining Brighton from Independiente two years ago. The 21-year-old, who is close to appointing new representatives, appeals to Chelsea because of his dynamism and technical quality. Chelsea have had a soft centre since losing Kant\u00e9 last August. They want to extend Kant\u00e9\u2019s contract beyond the end of the season but the 31-year-old\u2019s fitness problems have heightened the need for improvements in midfield. Another move for Fern\u00e1ndez, now or in the summer, has not been ruled out. Borussia Dortmund\u2019s Jude Bellingham and West Ham\u2019s Declan Rice are summer targets but Chelsea are not frontrunners for either England midfielder. There is pressure on Chelsea to act given Jorginho is increasingly likely to leave on a free this summer. Potter\u2019s other options in midfield include Mateo Kovacic, Denis Zakaria, Conor Gallagher, Mason Mount and Ruben Loftus-Cheek. Zakaria has impressed since his loan from Juventus but Kovacic and Loftus-Cheek have had injury problems this season. Chelsea have been busy this month, also signing Beno\u00eet Badiashile, Andrey Santos and David Datro Fofana. With Raheem Sterling and Christian Pulisic injured, the move for F\u00e9lix has not stopped them from considering another attacking player. Chelsea remain interested in the Shakhtar Donetsk winger Mykhailo Mudryk, who is wanted by Arsenal, and are monitoring Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach\u2019s Marcus Thuram. Shakhtar are demanding \u00a385m for Mudryk. Chelsea are also looking for cover for the injured Reece James at right-back, though suggestions they are set on hijacking Tottenham\u2019s move for Sporting Lisbon\u2019s Pedro Porro are premature."

                    "body": "\nMain event\nAnd then there were two! After one of the least predictable World Cups of all-time, we now have a final that won\u2019t surprise anyone \u2013 and what a final it should be.\nFear not, the Briefing knows its history and is extremely aware of how foolish a comment that is \u2013 and yet, and yet, and yet. In their semi-finals, both Argentina and France came up against teams with nous and organisation, but both found a way to impose their class while showing sufficient defensive perviousness to excite each other for the final.\n\nThe array of offensive talent, though, is only part of what makes Sunday\u2019s showcase so theoretically appealing. Ultimately, sport is a story, stories agitate the human psyche like nothing else, and this is a game leaden with narrative and meaning; with characters and themes.\nArgentina, already Copa Am\u00e9rica champions, are seeking to establish themselves as the finest international team on the planet. And should they win on Sunday, they will leave behind France and Uruguay, who sit on two World Cups, to tuck in behind Germany and Italy who have four, and Brazil, leading the way with five, as football\u2019s, fourth, er, \u2018winningest\u2019 nation. That\u2019s one thing.\n\nBut the other thing \u2013 a thing that\u2019s preoccupied us for the best part of a generation and has, to significant extent, defined this competition \u2013 is whether it will have the honour of being won by Lionel Messi. Whether he is the greatest player ever depends on your criteria \u2013 to the Briefing\u2019s mind Messi lacks the dangerous, intoxicating charisma of Diego Maradona at Mexico \u201886, where he played association football better than anyone before or since. But when it comes to sustained hand-over-mouth disbelief and involuntary shrieking of biological impossibilities, he\u2019s so far removed from everyone else it\u2019s hard not to wonder if he even exists. If Maradona did it like the devil, Messi plays like God.\nFrance, meanwhile, are seeking pure glory, and a place among the gallery of the immortals. Not since Brazil in 1962 has the most significant trophy in football been retained, and should they become the first side to achieve the feat in the modern era, they will rival both their own country\u2019s achievement of taking the 1998 World Cup followed by Euro 2000, and Spain\u2019s in harvesting three consecutive titles \u2013 two European Championships and one World Cup \u00ad\u2013 between 2008 and 2012.\nLike Argentina, they too have a player seeking what should be crowning glory of his career, aged just 23, Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 will be planning on winning another and another and another. Not since Maradona has there been a player of such inestimable confidence \u2013 of such justifiable certainty in the ridiculous uniqueness of his own ability \u2013 and he will expect to be the final\u2019s decisive figure. But unlike Maradona, who was all bouncing edge, and Messi, still a shuffling, unassuming magician, Mbapp\u00e9 is playful, childlike; and no less a killer, a footballing angel of death.\nHowever, Argentina and France have reached this stage not because they have the best players \u2013 though they do \u2013 but because they are the best teams, and reducing a match with so many aspects to Messi v Mbapp\u00e9 is foolish \u2013 almost as foolish as predicting a classic. But that\u2019s football for you. Bring it on! DH\nTalking points\nMorocco fall short but they have been a creditWalid Regragui could not resist the temptation to risk those who had taken Morocco to the brink of history. But adrenaline and a sense of occasion proved no substitute for physical readiness. Nayef Aguerd could not even make it past the warmup, Romain Sa\u00efss signalled his thigh could not sustain him once he was burned off by Olivier Giroud. Noussair Mazraoui did not survive past half-time. All three had been on the doubtful list. Perhaps Regragui might have shown more faith in the depth of his squad. Once rejigged into a 4-3-3, Morocco matched France to have the defending champions looking to the clock and referee for respite. Sofyan Amrabat excelled in midfield, just as against Spain and Portugal. He has been a star, just as his team\u2019s run to the last four has been the most welcome story from Qatar\u2019s World Cup. JB\n\nArgentina fans add authenticity in QatarTo those out in Qatar, the sense of jamboree found in previous World Cups has been somewhat absent. That\u2019s perhaps a byproduct of holding a tournament in a super-city constructed in the middle of a desert, an infrastructure built for the automobile rather than pedestrian. It is also suggested the cost of accommodation has been deliberately prohibitive to prevent the flood of humanity that usually swells the population of host cities. Morocco and Saudi Arabia, as Arab nations, have bucked that trend, as have Argentina. The South Americans always travel in huge numbers, doing so amid disappointment in Russia four years ago and with Rio turning into an Argentine enclave prior to the 2014 final against Germany. While questions continue to be raised over just how full stadiums have been, Argentina\u2019s wash of blue and white has added authenticity to the tournament, as do those lengthy, wordy terrace anthems their fans perform. JB\nBeyond the football\nIt has been revealed that Friday\u2019s quarter-final between the Netherlands and Argentina was the scene of a further tragedy to accompany the loss of Grant Wahl. On the day Wahl\u2019s family announced an autopsy revealed an aortic aneurysm was the cause of the celebrated journalist\u2019s sudden death, it was revealed a Kenyan migrant worker, 24-year-old John Njue Kibue, died while working as a security guard.\nKibue fell from the eighth storey of the Lusail Stadium before dying after three days in intensive care, a witness telling the Guardian that Kibue had fallen from the highest point of the concourse close to gate 30 of the stadium. \u201cQatar\u2019s tournament organisers are investigating the circumstances leading to the fall as a matter of urgency,\u201d read a statement from Qatar\u2019s Supreme Committee for Delivery and Legacy.\nAnne Wanjiru, Kibue\u2019s sister, told the Standard newspaper in Nairobi that help and an explanation are yet to be forthcoming from either the Qatari authorities or Fifa. \u201cWe want answers on the circumstances of his death,\u201d she said. \u201cThey are claiming he was intoxicated. We hear he had worked for long hours. The clarity of how he fell is not coming out.\u201d JB\n\nGlobal media-watch\nNovi list made much of Novak Djokovic sending his congratulations to Croatia on Instagram, while it was good to see that the English media doesn\u2019t have a monopoly on bemoaning refereeing decisions in the wake of an untimely exit. Jutarnji list described Italian referee Daniele Orsato\u2019s decision to award a spot kick to Argentina as \u201cthe penalty that divided the whole world\u201d.\nAntonio Juricic, the web sports editor at Slobodna Dalmacija, was having none of it. \u201cLet\u2019s concentrate on the bronze, and not on the fact that we were victims again. Because we are not,\u201d he said in a piece which also argued that \u201cthere is nothing wrong with the fact that you lost playing the kind of football that brought you to the semi-finals of the World Cup, and there is no point in spreading negativity\u201d.\n\nReaction in Argentina was, of course, rather different. In the Buenos Aires Times, Dan Edwards asked: \u201cwho would bet against Argentina now?\u201d Edwards added: \u201cagainst all expectations Lionel Scaloni turned out to be an inspired choice, carrying out Argentina\u2019s much-needed regeneration with minimal pain and forging a team abundant in both individual talent and collective spirit.\u201d\nAmong the celebrations there was a bit of defensiveness. La Naci\u00f3n devoted a whole column by Juan Manuel Trenado that attempted to refute the notion that Argentina had been favoured by refereeing decisions throughout the tournament. Trenado said that \u201cthe 10 minutes of added time that Mateu Lahoz gave and that allowed the Netherlands to draw\u201d, among other things, showed Fifa was not guiding Argentina into the final. Clar\u00edn put it simplest of all on their sports pages with the headline: \u201cFor the third World Cup\u201d. MB\nThe internet reacts\nThis pitchside view of Lionel Messi only makes you have even more sympathy for young Josko Gvardiol. GB\n\nAnd finally \u2026\nFootball has changed a lot over the decades, but an eternal pleasure is that \u2013 unlike many other team sports \u2013 quality is not directly proportionate to athleticism and physicality. For that reason the schemer exists and, though contemporary footballing vernacular has moved on there will always be a place in the game for a deft, cunning, lithe, tough, little kid who sees things that others don\u2019t, directing the big kids around the pitch according to their whims. There have been few as scheming as Luka Modric who, at 37, is coming to the end of his World Cup career. Not only a great of his generation but a great of the game, Modric is near-enough the perfect midfielder, the brains and heart behind Croatia\u2019s stunning consistency; Saturday\u2019s third-place playoff is an opportunity for us to appreciate him while we still can.

                    "body": "The groundbreaking 2031 Rugby World Cup in the USA may have to move to July and August to avoid a clash with the NFL after organisers vowed not to \u201cdo a Qatar\u201d.\nWorld Rugby\u2019s council rubber-stamped the decision to award the next five men\u2019s and women\u2019s World Cups at a meeting in Dublin on Thursday with Australia awarded the 2027 tournament, 24 years after hosting the 2003 competition in which England were crowned champions.\n\nThe USA has been awarded the men\u2019s competition in 2031 and the women\u2019s tournament in 2033 with organisers optimistic of generating $1bn in revenue from ticket sales alone. By comparison, the 2019 World Cup in Japan made around \u00a3350m from ticketing income.\nWith the NFL season traditionally beginning in early September, however, World Cup organisers are wary of failing to capture the imagination of the American public with any clash.\nCiting the Fifa men\u2019s World Cup which takes place in November and December in Qatar, in the middle of the season for the major European leagues, World Rugby confirmed a move to the summer is likely. That in turn, however, could cause problems for the dates of the 2030-31 season for domestic leagues and could see players running out in sweltering temperatures depending on the host cities.\n\u201cIf you think about the previous Rugby World Cup in Australia back in 2003, it was slightly later than what is now our World Cup window,\u201d said World Rugby\u2019s chief executive Alan Gilpin. \u201cThe US would probably ideally be slightly earlier. And again, what we now need to do with the certainty we\u2019ve got from today, is spend the time thinking about what the benefits and challenges are in that. And a lot of that will involve some really sort of grown-up discussions with professional leagues around the world and the impacts that could have on their seasons. We\u2019re not going to do a Qatar and just plonk it in the middle of a lot of other competitions. There are those considerations to have.\u201d\nThe decision to take the World Cup to the USA is bold considering they may not even qualify for the 2023 competition but the commercial opportunities have proved irresistible with the World Rugby chairman Bill Beaumont citing the \u201cgolden nugget\u201d. Organisers predict they will sell more than three million tickets \u2013 2.6m were made available for France 2023 \u2013 despite the comparatively low profile of the sport in the country. \u201cWe have 28 venues of over 60,000 and a couple of over 100,000,\u201d said USA Rugby\u2019s chief executive, Ross Young. \u201cThe tough part will be engagement. It\u2019s not going to be easy but taking 48 games around the country is eminently achievable.\u201d\n\nIndeed, Gilpin revealed that not only would organisers seek to avoid a clash with the NFL but they could partner with franchises to increase engagement. He added: \u201cWhat\u2019s been interesting in a lot of the discussions around it is the supportive nature of, for example, all the NFL franchises. So, can we be smart around that? If we can harness a little bit of a partnership with NFL franchises around hosting, the ability that gives us to really make this thing come alive quickly will be fantastic.\u201d\nWhile Australia were awarded the 2029 women\u2019s World Cup, England \u2013 the favourites for this year\u2019s competition \u2013 were confirmed as the hosts in 2025. The stated aim is to sell out Twickenham for the final and it is understood the Rugby Football Union has secured \u00a314.5m in government funding for its legacy programme. The RFU\u2019s chief operating officer, Sue Day, confirmed they will look to Euro 2022 in England this summer, for which tickets sold out in less than an hour, as a blueprint. She said: \u201cFootball is a few years ahead of us so we\u2019d be crazy not to try and learn from them. We have to learn lessons from each other, these are events that make women\u2019s sport bigger and better, we need to do it together.\u201d"

                    "body": "This article is part of the Guardian\u2019s World Cup 2022 Experts\u2019 Network, a cooperation between some of the best media organisations from the 32 countries who qualified. theguardian.com is running previews from two countries each day in the run-up to the tournament kicking off on 20 November.\nThe plan\nRecent performances and results have raised doubts about Portugal\u2019s possibilities of going far in this World Cup. In particular, the defeats by Serbia (which sent Fernando Santos\u2019s team to the World Cup qualifying playoff) and Spain (which meant they missed out on the Nations League finals).\nThe two losses exemplify the team\u2019s current inconsistency as they fluctuate between playing some splendidly attractive football and retreating in fear of conceding and defending badly. The team capable of thrashing Switzerland and the Czech Republic have also struggled in two games against Ireland.\n\nDespite the upheaval, Santos\u2019s optimism heading into the tournament seems as high as ever. In 2016 he announced that the team would not come home until after the final, and they won the Euros. This time he has only said: \u201cThe best is yet to come [from this team] and it will come this year. I can\u2019t be more concrete than that.\u201d\nThis Portugal squad have enough quality and quantity when it comes to world-class players to think about an unprecedented World Cup title, but they arrive in Qatar with huge question marks around two unavoidable figures. Pepe, who will be 40 next year, has struggled physically, and Cristiano Ronaldo has had to deal with the fact that he is not a certain starter at Manchester United, a situation that has come to a head following his extraordinary interview.\nDespite the uncertainties, Santos is likely to stick to his 4-3-3 that often turns into a 4-4-2 as Bernardo Silva moves from the right side of attack and into the middle. Rafael Le\u00e3o, who has been one of the best players in Serie A this season, is likely to be the main benefactor from Diogo Jota\u2019s injury and will start on the left side of attack.\n\nThe coach\nWinning Euro 2016 granted Fernando Santos a place in Portuguese football history but recent results have eroded some of the credit he gained. Adding the 2019 Nations League title did not hurt, of course, but elimination in the last 16 from the 2018 World Cup and, especially, Euro 2020 as well as the struggles to reach Qatar has increased criticism of the 68-year-old. Santos appears unruffled though and when asked about his future after the Nations League loss to Spain he said: \u201cThis defeat doesn\u2019t concern me at all. We conceded a goal at the end, that\u2019s it. I have a contract until 2024 and that\u2019s it.\u201d However that contract has also caused some damage to his reputation as he belatedly had to pay \u20ac4.5m in tax to the authorities after it was discovered that he was being paid through a company, rather than as an individual.\nStar player\n\u201cMy path with the national team is not over yet,\u201d Cristiano Ronaldo said when receiving an award from the Portuguese FA in September. \u201cI still feel motivated and my ambitions are as high as ever. I want to continue being part of the team for the World Cup and the 2024 European Championship.\u201d However, there were already doubts about his situation at Manchester United then and it has not got any better in the weeks leading up to the World Cup, with the early walkout against Spurs the nadir. Ronaldo apologised on social media, saying \u201csometimes the heat of the moment gets the better of you\u201d but Portugal\u2019s record goalscorer cannot possibly be in the best shape going into the tournament, even before that interview.\n\nUnsung hero\nA winner of both Euro 2016 and the Nations League in 2019, William Carvalho has now been an essential part of the Portuguese success story under Santos for longer than many people think. He has made more than 70 international appearances but Carvalho still struggles to get the recognition he deserves with the national team. True, there are more flamboyant players who hog the headlines but it feels as if \u201cSir William\u201d is going through one the most consistent periods of his career, playing at a high level for Real Betis.\nProbable lineup\n\nQatar stance\nSantos and the players had avoided talking about the controversy around the choice of Qatar to host the World Cup and the issues surrounding human rights and conditions for the construction workers at the stadiums, until Bruno Fernandes voiced his concerns on 13 November. \u201cWe know the surroundings of the World Cup,\u201d he said, \u201cabout the people who have died on the construction of the stadiums. We are not happy about that at all. We want football to be for everyone, everyone has to be included and involved in a World Cup because a World Cup is the world. It\u2019s for everyone, it doesn\u2019t matter who.\u201d\nNational anthem\nPatriotic from the start, A Portuguesa was written in 1890 (lyrics by Henrique Lopes de Mendon\u00e7a and music by Alfredo Keil), and appealed to national pride in the face of the \u201cEnglish ultimatum\u201d, which forced Portugal to withdraw from the African territories between Angola and Mozambique. It begins by talking about \u201cheroes of the sea\u201d, \u201cnoble people\u201d and a \u201cbrave nation\u201d, and ends with a combative message: \u201cFor the country, fight. Against the cannons, march, march!\u201d It only became the national anthem in 1911, a year after Portugal had become a republic.\nAll-time cult hero\nPaulo Futre is a Portuguese legend who played at the 1986 World Cup aged just 20 but had the misfortune to represent his country at the time when they often missed out on major tournaments. He still managed to enchant the country with a mesmerising left foot and played for all of the big three in Portugal, also becoming a hero at Atl\u00e9tico Madrid. Continued to create headlines after his retirement: in 2011, as a candidate to become Sporting president, he said he would sign a Chinese player and organise charter flights from the country for 400 to 500 people to watch games each week. Recently got Lionel Messi\u2019s autograph. \u201cIn my life I only asked for an autograph from one player: Diego Maradona,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd as there have been only two lefties better than me, I also wanted Messi\u2019s now.\u201d\nNuno Travassos writes for Maisfutebol.

                    "body": "At some point before the Socceroos landed in Doha, somebody \u2013 quite possibly a migrant worker \u2013 spent a not-insignificant amount of quality time with a pair of high-end hedge shears. By the start of this week, when the team started arriving at their World Cup training base, the maintenance was complete. The shrubbery in question, perfectly spaced and perched upon a neatly cultivated hill separating their two assigned training pitches, was fashioned into letters spelling out \u201cASPIRE ACADEMY\u201d.\nIn July, when the Socceroos announced they would stay here for the duration of the tournament, a brief public narrative formed that their late qualification had forced Football Australia staff to settle for second-rate dormitory accommodation while their higher-profile counterparts opted for secluded wellness resorts (Germany), uber-rich water parks (Belgium) and hotels resembling palaces (France).\n\nThis rendering of the Australian camp as subpar is not close to reality. Because the Aspire Academy does not start and end with diverting topiary. The facility is, like much of what Qatar\u2019s petrodollars produce, elite to the point of almost incomparability with anything else anywhere in the rest of the world.\nLocated on the western side of Doha, it has trained and educated thousands of young athletes, mainly in football but also in other sports including athletics, fencing, squash and table tennis. The base features eight football pitches including one in the Aspire Dome, a rather large (huge) indoor climate-controlled training complex.\nIn all, it cost $1.3bn to build. Once that was done, in 2004, it was launched by Pel\u00e9. Diego Maradona was there too. It has since been praised by Zinedine Zidane, Glenn Hoddle, Sven-G\u00f6ran Eriksson and, more recently, David Beckham. (We will come to Tim Cahill in a bit.) Suffice to say it is kind of a big deal.\n\nA crucial element of the Socceroos\u2019 arrangement is that \u2013 like Qatar\u2019s national team \u2013 they are staying on site (Ghana are also training here minus the sleepovers), eradicating a key logistical irritation for the players of having to travel between a hotel and training each day.\n\u201cIt\u2019s refreshing,\u201d midfielder Riley McGree said on Wednesday. \u201cI think those bus rides, especially after training when it\u2019s a little bit of a long one, aren\u2019t great. But being right on the training pitch you literally walk in, walk out, go back to your room, go to meals, go to physio and everything.\n\u201cIt definitely makes it a whole lot more convenient and the facilities here are second to none, so there\u2019s been no complaints. It\u2019s been awesome.\u201d\n\nIn terms of setting Australia up for the best possible chance of on-field success, it is indeed awesome. All the more because staff have furnished the place in green and gold and motivational messaging, brought their in-house chef and even flown in a barista.\nAnd yet the plush surroundings also feel somewhat uneasy. Aspire, which has been showered in state funding for the best part of two decades, is the centrepiece of Qatar\u2019s football project, a project accused of sportswashing, corruption and human rights abuses. The Garcia report of 2014, which examined the bidding process for the 2022 World Cup, states the academy\u2019s resources were used to \u201ccurry favour\u201d with Fifa executive committee members.\nAspire has also come under scrutiny for its Football Dreams project, a mass talent-scouting operation across Africa, Asia and Latin America. Launched in 2007, it is self-described as \u201ca unique humanitarian project\u201d; critics say it has been a vehicle for peddling influence in other Fifa nations as well as naturalising talented kids in time to field a credible World Cup national team.\n\nQatar denies this, but Aspire\u2019s efforts have nonetheless yielded results. In 2014, Qatar won the Asian U19 championship, and in 2018 the senior team won the Asian Cup \u2013 both times under former La Masia coach F\u00e9lix S\u00e1nchez. More than two-thirds of the squad had been trained at Aspire. Since being awarded the World Cup in 2010, the team have climbed from No 113 to No 51 in the Fifa rankings.\nHowever you spin it, Aspire\u2019s legacy is angsty, featuring both good and bad and plenty in between. Regardless, as a state-run enterprise it is difficult to think of it as anything but synonymous with Qatar\u2019s broader football agenda. It has also become synonymous with Tim Cahill, Aspire\u2019s chief sports officer, who is, in turn, synonymous with the Socceroos. That complicates Australia\u2019s place in the landscape.\n\nIn 2020, the former striker and current national treasure made the decision to become a Qatar 2022 ambassador. Several months ago he was critical in securing the Socceroos\u2019 setup here. On Tuesday the 42-year-old was announced as part of Australia\u2019s official World Cup staff under the title of \u201chead of delegation\u201d.\nHis first quote in the media release read: \u201cThe Aspire Academy is recognised as one of the world\u2019s leading sports academies and I am thrilled that we have been able to secure these facilities for our national team during this tournament.\u201d\nThis is not to say the Socceroos should not have accepted Aspire\u2019s hospitality in good faith. The players have made a strong and nuanced statement on human rights when they were not obliged to do so. It is also nigh on impossible to play at a World Cup without also having somewhere to train and sleep in the host country. More than anything, the situation is just one example of the complexities that exist within the larger, thorny web that constitutes this uncomfortable tournament and all its trappings.\nThere is a sense Australia may be treading delicately with Qatar, a fellow Asian Football Confederation member where the Socceroos not only played numerous qualifiers during the pandemic, but will undoubtedly have to return in the future."

                    "body": "Harry Kane is determined to shine a light on human rights abuses in Qatar with the help of captains from other national teams after expressing misgivings at the Gulf state hosting the World Cup this year.\nThe England captain mentioned his Tottenham teammates Hugo Lloris and Son Heung-min \u2013 who captain France and South Korea respectively \u2013 and former clubmates such as Gareth Bale \u2013 the captain of Wales, who are hoping to qualify \u2013 as he looked to rally strength in numbers to drive lasting social change.\n\nKane and his England teammates were briefed at St George\u2019s Park on Tuesday about the issues surrounding Qatar\u2019s hosting of the finals tournament \u2013 chiefly the rights of women, the LGBTQ+ community and migrant workers.\nGareth Southgate, the England manager, led the conversation, with input from other Football Association members of staff, including Mark Bullingham, the chief executive, and Edleen John, the director of international relations, corporate affairs and co-partner for equality, diversity and inclusion.\nSouthgate and Bullingham will travel to Qatar for the World Cup draw on Friday week and the FA is considering whether to give migrant workers a voice as part of any England media activity there.\nKane said: \u201cThere\u2019s a couple of other national captains at Tottenham or maybe it\u2019s talking to other national team captains to see if we can be unified, what we try and do. We haven\u2019t spoken about it yet but, over the next weeks and months, it\u2019s definitely a conversation we should have because when you are together as nations and you have that unity in terms of captains, you can send a message.\n\n\u201cIt is something I will try to do. I think that will send out a bigger and more powerful message. It is part of the responsibility of a captain. It is important to talk about these things and not just hide away from them. And I know for sure the other lads will be happy to be talking about it, too. Hopefully we can make a real impact.\u201d\nKane was asked whether it was right that the World Cup finals tournament had gone to Qatar. \u201cIt\u2019s a hard question to answer, if I am totally honest,\u201d he said. \n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t our decision, it was the decision of Fifa. \n\u201cThe World Cup is one of the greatest tournaments I have ever played in. There is definitely that excitement of being there and experiencing that again \u2013 2018 was incredible for me and the other players involved. But there are some issues that you can\u2019t hide away from. There are, of course, some conflicting emotions around it.\n\u201cFor me and our team it\u2019s about controlling what we can control and that\u2019s to make sure we do what we can and use our platforms to help in any way we can. But also still be excited about a major tournament. We will have to learn to cope with it and balance the two.\u201d\n\nKane admitted that in terms of gestures the England squad were unclear, as yet, about what they may do. Some national teams in Europe have worn T-shirts and displayed banners that have drawn attention to the human rights issues in Qatar. What Kane did say he wanted to see was action that led to change which went far beyond the four weeks of the tournament.\n\u201cAny issues that we are trying to resolve are trying to be resolved forever,\u201d Kane said. \u201cIt is not just a quick fix. The fact there is a light shining on Qatar will help the situation and help us talk about it. Having these conversations now is definitely useful. But it is important those conversations carry on.\n\n\u201cIt is similar to taking the knee [in the fight against racism]. It is not just something we did for a small amount of time. By carrying on, we keep showing our support and that has been really important. I think the same thing will happen in Qatar and, after the tournament, it will be important to keep talking about the issues and make sure anything we do help or improve is for the rest of time, not just a few months.\u201d\nEngland are preparing for Wembley friendlies against Switzerland and Ivory Coast on Saturday and next Tuesday. Bukayo Saka did not train on Wednesday because of illness, although he is not believed to be Covid\u2011positive. The goalkeeper Sam Johnstone has withdrawn and is likely to be replaced by Fraser Forster."

                    "body": "This article is part of the Guardian\u2019s World Cup 2022 Experts\u2019 Network, a cooperation between some of the best media organisations from the 32 countries who qualified. theguardian.com is running previews from two countries each day in the run-up to the tournament kicking off on 20 November.\nThe plan\nThe plan isn\u2019t much of a plan any more, more a case of \u201cit is what it is\u201d. Roberto Mart\u00ednez is simply sticking to the same tactical shape he introduced six years ago: the 3-4-3. The personnel has changed, though. Vincent Kompany has gone. Thomas Vermaelen too, with the former Arsenal defender now one of the assistant managers. Instead, when Belgium played Wales and the Netherlands in the Nations League in September, the back three featured three players from the Belgian Jupiler Pro League.\nToby Alderweireld (Antwerp) and Jan Vertonghen (Anderlecht) have recently come back home after playing in Qatar and Benfica respectively, while the promising Anderlecht teenager Zeno Debast made his debut in September. The problem is that Alderweireld and Vertonghen are not at the same level as they were at Tottenham a few years back.\n\nBelgium lost twice against the Netherlands in four months and the old, shaky defence is the main worry. The world-class goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois can\u2019t stop all the attacks on his own. The other options at the back aren\u2019t too encouraging either. Jason Denayer has not helped himself by rejecting several offers after leaving Lyon in the summer. He trained on his own for several months before signing for Shabab Al Ahli in Dubai in October.\nUp front, Romelu Lukaku had a bad season at Chelsea then injured himself upon returning to Internazionale. He only got back to full fitness in October but has reportedly aggravated it again. Eden Hazard is finally injury-free at Real Madrid after three years of misery, but is not getting many minutes.\n\u201cEden is still of great value for Belgium,\u201d Mart\u00ednez said of his captain. \u201cThe question is whether he can play 90 minutes and whether he can handle seven matches in a short period of time. No one is looking away from that reality. Eden hasn\u2019t played at a constant level for a long time and that has consequences. But he showed his worth during the last international break.\u201d\nHazard still gets the nod with Leandro Trossard used as a super sub. Otherwise Belgium rely heavily on Courtois and Kevin De Bruyne, their last remaining world-class players.\n\nThe coach\nIt is not yet known who will succeed Roberto Mart\u00ednez after the World Cup nor, in fact, who is appointing the manager. Mart\u00ednez currently combines the job of technical director and national team coach at the Belgian FA but his contract is running out at the end of the year \u2013 will he pick his own successor? After six years the patience of the Belgian public is slowly running out, although what happens in Qatar will define his legacy. Mart\u00ednez led Belgium to their best result in a World Cup, the third place in Russia in 2018, but he has not won a trophy and Euro 2020 was a disappointment as Belgium were knocked out by Italy in the quarter-finals. It may well be that the golden generation will for ever be known as the bronze generation. Mart\u00ednez is getting more and more criticism for sticking to his untouchables; the fans expect to see more experimentation and new faces. Even his \u201cMr Brightside\u201d demeanour in interviews and press conferences is starting to frustrate some supporters. He has lost a lot of credit.\nStar player\nDuring a recent game against the Netherlands Kevin De Bruyne got frustrated. At Manchester City he is playing with the best in the world. With Belgium that\u2019s a thing of the past. With Hazard and Lukaku often missing, De Bruyne has established himself even more as the leader on the pitch: the man who dictates everything. Belgium rely on his brilliance. At Euro 2020 De Bruyne suffered an ankle injury in the last-16 win against Portugal but still played \u2013 with injections \u2013 in the quarter-final. It shows his commitment to the national team. In the last 10 competitive games he has been involved in eight out of 18 goals while playing as a roaming No 10 but some of his best football has come as a box-to-box midfielder.\n\nUnsung hero\nIn what would be Mart\u00ednez\u2019s preferred lineup there is not really an unsung hero but, when Lukaku is missing, Belgium can turn to Michy Batshuayi. Inconsistent at club level for many years while he was loaned out time and again by Chelsea, he is reliable for Belgium. Lukaku has played only one international game over the past year while Batshuayi delivered in four of the past eight games and his overall record stands at 26 goals in 47 international appearances. Not a bad tally. His goalscoring is better than his overall involvement in games but that is sometimes enough against lesser opponents. A super sub.\nProbable lineup\n\nQatar stance\nBefore the World Cup qualifier against Belarus in March 2021 a second-string Belgian team walked out in shirts adorned with the slogan: \u201cFootball supports change\u201d, echoing the message of the Netherlands team around the same time. The Belgian FA also joined forces with their German, Dutch, Norwegian and Swedish counterparts, saying: \u201cWe actively stand up against racism and are not ignoring the problems in Qatar. We demand stronger action to improve working conditions and human rights.\u201d In September the Belgian FA CEO, Peter Bossaert, said: \u201cBelgium regret that Qatar won the World Cup bid\u201d \u2013 and they will join England and other countries in the One Love campaign, with the captain wearing a rainbow-coloured armband.\nNational anthem\nFor king, for freedom and for law! The Belgium national anthem is called La Braban\u00e7onne and, according to legend, the song was written in 1830 during the Belgian revolution. It has been attributed to a young revolutionary called Jenneval, a French actor working in Belgium, who apparently read the lyrics during a meeting at the Aigle d\u2019Or cafe in Brussels. The music is written by Fran\u00e7ois van Campenhout and is based on a French song called L\u2019Air des Lanciers Polonais. The lyrics were changed in 1860 to hail the kingdom and the independence from the Netherlands in 1830. They exist in the three official languages (French, Dutch, German) but the anthem is not taught in school and many Belgians do not know the words. In fact, the politician Yves Leterme once accidentally began to sing La Marseillaise, the French national anthem, when asked about the lyrics of the Belgian one.\nAll-time cult hero\nWhen Ronaldo is asked to name his best teammates, he occasionally gives Luc Nilis as an answer. \u201cWe played together at PSV,\u201d the Brazilian once said. \u201cHe always gave me great assists. Every time, every match. More than [Zinedine] Zidane. Whenever he came up against the goalkeeper he was never selfish and made sure I scored. He was incredibly generous.\u201d Nilis scored brilliant goals while playing in the Netherlands but his talent never got fully recognised in Belgium, partly as he scored only 10 goals in 56 games for the national team. At club level he scored over 300. His career ended when he suffered a double fracture of his right shin in his third league game for Aston Villa and, as the injury got infected, there were even fears he may lose a leg. Nilis, who is loved by hardcore football fans in Belgium, went through some dark times after the injury but is now managing in the lower leagues.\nKristof Terreur writes for HLN.

                    "body": "Far from the glittering towers of Doha, off a road lined with scruffy fast-food outlets and down a narrow, bumpy lane that leads to a beach, stands the hotel that will host England at the World Cup. When David Beckham and Gary Neville visited recently, their initial reaction was less than enthusiastic.\u201cWho chose this?\u201d was Neville\u2019s blunt assessment, as they stood in front of the Souq Al Wakra hotel\u2019s modest entrance. But what the hotel lacks in glamour it makes up for in privacy. High walls enclose the venue, which is built in the traditional style of the souk that surrounds it. Rooms are arranged around small courtyards to preserve guests\u2019 privacy. There are few externally facing windows; the only view of the beach is from a rooftop seating area. Once inside, Beckham was more upbeat. \u201cThe thing that you look for is tranquillity more than anything. You want to be in the middle of nowhere,\u201d he said as he strolled through the hotel\u2019s grounds. \u201cThis is the perfect set-up.\u201d  The beachfront has the feel of a rundown English seaside town, only hotter. As the heat eases in the evening, families come to swim in the sea or take a camel ride along the beach. Back inside, the staff appear excited at the prospect of hosting top footballers. \u201cDo you know the England team will be staying here? They\u2019ve booked the whole hotel. David Beckham came \u2013 I served him,\u201d an Indian waiter says eagerly. \u201cThere\u2019s no alcohol allowed. We are a dry hotel,\u201d he adds, suggesting privacy is not the only reason the England manager, Gareth Southgate, favours the hotel. For footballers used to outrageous luxury, it is a modest choice, more four-star than five. The standard rooms are small; there are few facilities, limited eating options and no swimming pool (not that December is swimming season in Qatar). Rooms are available from about \u00a370 a night. While 24 of the tournament\u2019s 32 teams will be based within 10km of each other in Doha, England\u2019s hotel is in Al Wakrah, a small town about 25 minutes\u2019 drive south of the capital. Beyond the beach and souk, there is little to see or do, but in a country as small as Qatar, nothing is very far away. England\u2019s designated training ground is a few minutes from the hotel. Al Bayt Stadium, where England could play most of their games, is the farthest away of the eight stadiums, but is still less than an hour\u2019s drive away. Sitting in the hotel\u2019s main courtyard, with fountains gurgling in the background, Beckham \u2013 who has reportedly signed a multimillion-pound deal to promote Qatar \u2013 told Neville what an \u201cincredible experience\u201d the World Cup would be. This is going to be a tournament that you\u2019re not going to want to miss.\u201d  However, while the England team may be able to escape the frenzy of fans in their beach-side hideaway, they will not be able to avoid the shadow of labour abuses that will fall on this World Cup. In the souk outside and along the beachfront promenade, security guards from places including Kenya, Nepal and Pakistan endure 12-hour shifts for just over \u00a31 an hour. They say they work 30 days a month. \u201cIf I take a day off, they cut my salary,\u201d says one. They say they have all been forced to pay extortionate fees \u2013 of up to \u00a31,360 \u2013 to agents in their home countries to secure their jobs, meaning they have to work for months just to repay the costs. Recent reforms to Qatar\u2019s labour laws \u2013 touted by Fifa\u2019s president, Gianni Infantino \u2013 should mean they are free to change jobs and look for something better, but the workers who spoke to the Guardian say it is impossible. \u201cThe company will not give us permission to leave. They tell us we have to cancel our visas, go home and then apply for another job,\u201d says one. Near the hotel, a Kenyan security guard, in the middle of another 12-hour shift, has a different take from Beckham. He explains that his salary is far lower than he was promised when he left home.  \u201cIt\u2019s a trap, because you are told one thing in Kenya and another in Qatar,\u201d he says. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing you can do. Just keep quiet and get on with it.\u201d Under Qatari employment law, foreign workers have the right to change jobs if their contract is terminated and legal procedures are in place if an employee does not receive their wages or allowances at the end of their contract. The Qatari government also said a fund to support workers, including by reimbursing unpaid wages or benefits, had paid out \u00a3152.5m by last month.

The Leicester playmaker, who has been in outstanding form in 2022, had feared he would be overlooked by a manager who has previously used him only once \u2013 as a substitute in the European Championship qualifying win over Montenegro in November 2019.\nSouthgate also recalled Marcus Rashford, rewarding the Manchester United striker for his return to form, and found room for Ben White, Callum Wilson and Conor Gallagher. White will offer an option at right-back, with Reece James ruled out because of a knee injury, and will also provide depth in central defence, where Fikayo Tomori and Marc Gu\u00e9hi have been excluded.\n\nGallagher\u2019s inclusion is something of a surprise, given he has started only seven games in all competitions for Chelsea, where he returned over the summer after a successful loan at Crystal Palace. Southgate has capped him four times, most recently last June in the dismal 4-0 home loss to Hungary in the Nations League, and said he was impressed at how Gallagher had reacted to being left out in September, including showing an excellent attitude with the Under-21s.\nMaddison had been called up in October 2018 and September 2019 without playing and was included by Southgate in October 2019 for the qualifying ties against the Czech Republic and Bulgaria only to withdraw, citing illness. He was then photographed at a casino while his teammates lost in Prague, leading to uncomfortable questions for Southgate, who nonetheless selected him for his next squad and gave Maddison his debut against Montengro before naming him as an unused substitute against Kosovo.\n\u201cThat was unfortunate from his perspective,\u201d Southgate said of the casino incident. \u201cIt was a bigger issue [for him] than it was for me. It wasn\u2019t the drama that it seemed to be for everyone else.\u201d\nMaddison has had 22 Premier League goal involvements in this calendar year, a figure bettered only by Harry Kane, Kevin De Bruyne and Son Heung-min. \u201cHe\u2019s playing really well,\u201d Southgate said of Maddison. \u201cHe\u2019s a good player; we\u2019ve always said he\u2019s a good player \u2013 he\u2019s earned the right. We think he can give us something slightly different from the other attacking players we have got.\u201d\n\nSouthgate said of breaking the news to Maddison: \u201cHe was delighted. I had some very difficult calls that were emotionally at the other end of the spectrum.\u201d The manager said he had spoken only to Maddison, Kyle Walker, Kalvin Phillips and the players he left out and that he had told those omitted: \u201cThings can still change over the weekend.\u201d\nWilson, like Rashford, has been out of the picture. The Newcastle striker won the last of his four caps in October 2019 but has been in goalscoring touch this season and has been preferred to Tammy Abraham and Ivan Toney. \u201cTammy\u2019s had a poor run of scoring form at the wrong time really,\u201d Southgate said. There is no place for the West Ham winger Jarrod Bowen, who has failed to hit his stride this season.\n\nSouthgate has selected the Manchester City pair Walker and Phillips in his 26-man squad for Qatar even though the former is recovering from groin surgery on 4 October. Phillips has barely played this season, mainly because of a shoulder operation towards the end of September, although he made his return as a second-half substitute in the Carabao Cup on Wednesday.\nSouthgate said Walker was not back in full training but would be available before the end of the group stage and that to have picked James would have been \u201cdeemed arrogant in some circles\u201d when the Chelsea player would not have been ready until the latter stages if everything went perfectly. Walker, he said, was \u201ca long way ahead of that\u201d.\nThere was further England devastation for James Ward-Prowse as he was omitted, having also been cut at the very last before the Euros in the summer of last year. \u201cJames is competing with [Jude] Bellingham and [Jordan] Henderson and to a lesser degree Conor Gallagher and he is just behind those guys,\u201d Southgate said.\n\nRashford\u2019s previous England appearance came in the Euro 2020 penalty shootout defeat against Italy, when he missed his kick. Southgate had previously counted on him at the 2018 World Cup in Russia and the player\u2019s experience helped to press his case. As expected, Trent Alexander-Arnold has been included.\nTottenham\u2019s manager, Antonio Conte, said on Wednesday that Harry Kane was \u201creally tired\u201d, prompting Southgate to respond: \u201cI\u2019m sure he is!\u201d"

I like it when they hug, I like it when they run about all pleased \u2013 if someone established a branch of mime or contemporary dance based on football players and their physical expression of joy, I would instantly prefer that to all existing mime. At the same time, if you don\u2019t care especially about the football yet the people around you do, and very deeply \u2013 let\u2019s call them your sons or daughters, your spouses, friends, those you like the look of on social media platforms \u2013 getting to this point in an international tournament is a bloody nightmare. You can get in all the Doritos you want, and nothing will change the outcome. You spent all that time hoping they would reach the quarter-finals up against someone rubbish, and it was wasted. It was illogical. Rubbish teams get knocked out! You will almost be able to taste the disappointment if England loses against France next weekend; you can map its awful progress, the grey pall it will cast over everyone in the house, even the ones who were just waiting for the TV to be free so they could watch Wednesday. Somewhere in the back of your mind, there\u2019s a voice saying: hang on, don\u2019t we always lose against France? But is that old 90s intel? It\u2019s too stressful to Google. Then, if they/we win, it\u2019s even worse, because we have to go through the whole thing again, only now the stakes are higher, the potential disappointment even keener, the team presumably better \u2013 isn\u2019t that how these things work? And, then, if we were to win that, but lose the one after, there\u2019s a good chance it will ruin Christmas. Psychotherapy, I\u2019m sure, would have something useful to say about this; something about not trying to micromanage other people\u2019s emotions, letting them sit with their impotent rage without seeking to minimise or dispel it. This is probably a useful skill to take into life post-World Cup: a bit more compassion, a bit less empathy, resilience in the face of other people\u2019s disappointment. Sure, fine, whatever. I don\u2019t want emotional learnings. I just want a team I\u2019ve only recently been able to recognise to win everything.

                    "body": "Aziz Behich\u2019s mazy run Let\u2019s start with what might have been \u2013 what would have been the goal of this tournament so far and one of the all-time great World Cup goals. \u201cIf Aziz Behich had scored that, it would have been like Lionel Messi in a yellow shirt,\u201d said coach Graham Arnold after the Argentina match. The Socceroos had just pulled one back to give themselves renewed hope when the left-back channelled his inner-Messi and went on a marauding, weaving run that carried him past one defender, in between another two, all the way into the opposition box, and then back inside a fourth man in blue and white stripes to get a clear sight of the Argentinian goal.  Behich\u2019s right foot swung at the ball; glory and a place in the annals of Australia sporting history awaited. Sadly, Lisandro Mart\u00ednez had other ideas. His brilliant last-ditch tackle blocked the effort, and Australia ultimately went home.  Garang Kuol\u2019s nearly moment Included in Graham Arnold\u2019s squad for his potential as an \u201cimpact player\u201d off the bench, the 18-year-old came within a whisker of living up to his billing on the biggest of stages. Having made his World Cup debut as a substitute in the opener against France (becoming the youngest Socceroo since Harry Kewell in 1996) Kuol was then brought on against Argentina in the last-16 game (becoming the youngest player to feature in the knockout stage of a World Cup since Pel\u00e9 in 1958). His moment arrived deep in stoppage time after a deft first touch to control Craig Goodwin\u2019s cross allowed him to roll Nicol\u00e1s Tagliafico and tee up a shooting opportunity. Score and Australia would send the match to extra-time. But, like Behich 15 minutes earlier, he was denied by an outstretched Argentine limb, this time the arm of Emiliano Mart\u00ednez. Nevertheless, it was a brilliant piece of skill and a truly memorable moment, one which alerted the world to Kuol\u2019s talents and signals a bright future. Arnold has suggested the advent of a new golden generation, and Kuol is likely at the heart of it.  Federation Square lights up Football in Australia, we are told, is a minority sport. No one cares about football any more. The domestic leagues are on a downward spiral. There\u2019s no way football can \u2013 or will \u2013 ever compete with other codes. The game, at the professional level at least, is dying a slow and painful death. And yet. And yet the Socceroos\u2019 run in Qatar captivated a nation for the past two weeks, hauled football back on to the front pages and breakfast TV, prompted Socceroos scarves to be proudly displayed in parliament, and even had the prime minister tweeting about it. Of course much of this novel interest is from once-every-four-year blow-ins, but the scenes in Melbourne for the 2am kick-off against Tunisia \u2013 with thousands in attendance in the dead of night \u2013 gave a reminder that football\u2019s heart is still beating in Australia. The question now for the game is how to harness that passion and dedication to bring a sleeping giant into the mainstream.  Four Australian goals to enjoy It took just nine minutes for the Socceroos to open their account in Qatar. Craig Goodwin\u2019s well-taken goal stunned defending world champions France and while the euphoria of leading the defending champions in a World Cup match lasted just 18 minutes, it would not be the last time Australia found the back of the net. Mitch Duke\u2019s perfectly executed header did for Tunisia before Mat Leckie\u2019s wonderful jinking solo effort secured passage from Group D by the same 1-0 scoreline. Craig Goodwin did the heavy lifting for Australia\u2019s final goal of the tournament against Argentina, although his deflected strike went down as an Enzo Fern\u00e1ndez own-goal. It was the first time Australia have scored in every game of a World Cup finals campaign, and only once have they scored more \u2013 in 2006 Tim Cahill (two), John Aloisi, Craig Moore and Harry Kewell made it five in total \u2013 and each goal in Qatar was savoured with just as much gusto as in Germany.  Graham Arnold gets his dues The coach was nearly out of a job not so long ago, having overseen a slump in form that extended the long and winding road to qualification for Qatar via the tortuous playoff route.  He might still be out of a job, despite everything achieved at the finals, given his contract is up and Football Australia has yet to confirm if he\u2019ll be offered a new deal. But what Arnold has ensured with his team\u2019s run to the last 16 is that he has proved the doubters wrong.  No one can argue with the bare fact that he guided a Socceroos side to the last 16 of a World Cup for just the second time. And he did so by getting the best out of a group of players far less feted than their predecessors in 2006. Time will tell if this latest crop will prove to be the country\u2019s next \u201cgolden generation\u201d but for now, Arnold \u2013 who gloriously said after the win over Denmark, \u201cNo celebrations, no emotion. Sleep, no social media\u201d \u2013 may now allow himself a moment to reflect on a hugely satisfying campaign."

                    "body": "Ousmane Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 is a player who drifts in and out of focus. While Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 explodes down the left flank for France, Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 is more of a gliding presence on the opposite side. Sometimes marking him is like trying to catch smoke. The France winger has this lovely way of floating up the right, a softness to the way he dips inside and out, and when he is in full flow he is a bewitching sight, so slippery as he unbalances defenders with his feints, body swerves and zigzagging dribbling.\nThose are the moments when it is easy to see why Barcelona, wounded after losing Neymar to Paris Saint-Germain, spent \u00a397m on Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 five years ago. The problem, though, is there have not been enough good times for the 25-year-old. Sometimes he looks special but he often lets games pass him by, underlining why he barely featured for France in the four years leading up to this World Cup.\nIt is a delicate balancing act. Not so long ago Demb\u00e9l\u00e9, with honourable mentions to Philippe Coutinho and Antoine Griezmann, was the symbol of Bar\u00e7a\u2019s financial excess. There were endless questions over his focus and poor timekeeping, and constant injury problems; at the start of 2022 you would have got long odds on him ending the year in France\u2019s starting lineup in the World Cup final.\n\nYet here we are. France face Argentina at the Lusail Stadium and it would be a major surprise if Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 does not start on the right wing. The comeback story, if not quite complete, is moving in the desired direction.\nWho knows how it will end? Four years ago Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 flattered to deceive when France became world champions. He was in the starting lineup when the tournament began but his performances during the group stage were disappointing and, having lost his place to Olivier Giroud before the knockout stage arrived, he was an unused substitute when France beat Croatia in the final.\n\nBut Demb\u00e9l\u00e9, who also failed to make an impact at Euro 2020, is in a better place now. When he spoke to the media on Friday he looked at ease with himself. The former Borussia Dortmund star happily talked about playing with Lionel Messi at Bar\u00e7a, recalling how the Argentina captain urged him to dribble less and focus more on team play. He did not react badly when he was asked whether his increased maturity has been key to him forcing his way into Didier Deschamps\u2019 plans.\n\u201cI feel really good,\u201d said Demb\u00e9l\u00e9, whose hopes of going to the World Cup looked slim when he was left out of France\u2019s Nations League squad in June. \u201cI\u2019m happy my image has changed.\u201d\nIt is about time the attention was on Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 for good reasons. Perhaps it will be him rather than Mbapp\u00e9 who makes the headlines against Argentina. After all, it is easy to forget how much hype surrounded him when he was a youngster. He was a wonderkid at Rennes and brilliant after moving to Thomas Tuchel\u2019s Dortmund in 2016. A year later, though, everything changed. Bar\u00e7a came calling and Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 found the pressure difficult to handle. He stagnated. He was injured. He was a scapegoat for Bar\u00e7a\u2019s decline, particularly when they lost Messi to PSG.\n\nBy the start of January this year, with his contract running down, Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 was cast as a villain in some quarters. However, although links with Chelsea offered hope of a reunion with Tuchel, he stayed at the Camp Nou. Bar\u00e7a\u2019s manager, Xavi Hern\u00e1ndez, valued the outsider, who responded by finishing last season with 13 assists in La Liga.\nXavi\u2019s faith paid off. Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 could have left on a free in the summer but after some tense negotiations he stayed at Barcelona. He has pushed on since then, his five assists and four goals lifting the club to top spot in La Liga and earning Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 a seat on the plane to Qatar.\n\nLike Xavi, Deschamps never fully lost faith. France\u2019s manager has kept plugging away at Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 in Qatar. Fit enough to last beyond the 70th minute in five of six games, he has two assists and was impressive during the early stages of France\u2019s quarter-final win against England, causing tactical problems for Luke Shaw with his movement and partnership with Griezmann.\nThe sense remains, though, that there is more to come. After starting promisingly against England Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 faded to the margins, becoming less effective when Shaw snapped in with more intensity. Then, given the chance to use his pace on the break against Morocco on Wednesday, Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 did little in attack. He had no shots and managed two successful dribbles. At one point he tried a cross and miskicked.\nBut with Mbapp\u00e9 given licence to do as he pleases on the left, the counter is that Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 is working for the collective and providing balance by being more restrained. He is tracking back, playing the Deschamps way, winning plaudits for providing Jules Kound\u00e9 with defensive cover. \u201cIt\u2019s important to help the team,\u201d Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 said. \u201cI will do what\u2019s necessary.\u201d\nThere was no dissent from Demb\u00e9l\u00e9. Equally, he still wants to be more decisive in the final third. Scoring a goal would be nice, he added. \u201cI want to be a protagonist in this World Cup,\u201d Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 said. \u201cNot a follower.\u201d The final gives him an opportunity to lead the way."

Discussing the release of the track, the pair said that although their famous refrain \u201cfootball\u2019s coming home\u201d had become redundant after victory for the England women\u2019s team earlier this year, they would give it \u201cone more go for the blokes\u201d. \u201cWe could not resist the fact that the World Cup was at Christmas, and people have said in the past that football songs are a little bit tacky, and obviously Christmas songs are a bit tacky,\u201d Skinner told the One Show on Thursday. \u201cIn maths two negatives make a positive, so we think there\u2019s so much tacky in this that it\u2019s going to be a classic.\u201d Baddiel added: \u201cThe Lionesses brought it home, football came home and some would say that\u2019s the end of the song, stop singing it. But we decided to give it one more go on the basis that the blokes have not brought it home.\u201d The men\u2019s tournament, taking place in Qatar, is due to run from 20 November until 18 December. The music video shows Skinner and Baddiel dressed in Christmas jumpers while superimposed next to their younger selves, and decorating a tree with Lioness baubles while singing. Part of the new lyrics are: \u201cThe blokes seem cursed whatever they try and I think I know why, they\u2019re just jinxed in July. \u201cBut it\u2019s December \u2026 three lions on a sleigh. With she-lions inspiration, Santa says, \u2018Let\u2019s play\u2019.\u201d Speaking about the performance of the Lionesses, who won the Euros after defeating Germany in July, Skinner said: \u201cThe fact is, the best I\u2019ve ever seen an England team play was this summer and it was the Lionesses. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t like: \u2018Oh yes we\u2019ve got to support the women\u2019s game\u2019 \u2013 no, this was brilliant football.\u201d Three Lions was first released by Skinner, Baddiel and Ian Broudie in 1996, becoming a popular British song at major international football competitions since. England\u2019s first game in the 2022 World Cup is due to take place on Monday against Iran."

While Lionel Messi was rewriting history they moved through one of Qatar\u2019s opulent shopping malls, area by area, fulfilling the cleaning tasks their employer had assigned.\nIt was not too hard to glean what was going on, and sometimes Isaac would try to make his old Nokia phone strain for updates. But football, and especially football as inaccessible as this, was really a remote concern. Walking past designer handbags, perfumes and suits every day feels like a trudge through vacant, empty space. The young Ghanaian men are in their third month here and are yet to be paid a penny.\n\n\u201cThey told us they would pay this month but they told us that the previous times too,\u201d says Isaac. \u201cI have no money. I\u2019m not happy at all. People tell you before you come here that it\u2019s better and that, with hard work, you can get everything you want. But it\u2019s just not like that.\u201d\nIt is mid-evening and company buses have just dropped them off from another potentially fruitless shift. The daily return of Doha\u2019s migrant workers is a sight few visitors will have witnessed over the past month, partly because some organisations were incentivised to keep their staff at home during the tournament in an attempt to ease congestion.\nFor several hours from about 4pm, vehicles chug along the gridded, heavily polluted capillaries of the city\u2019s remote south-west and pour employees back into their labour camps en masse. It is a bleak, unsettling scene: the men deployed to keep an entire state running are being shuttled straight from one confinement into what is, effectively, another.\nWe are in one such camp, the precise whereabouts of which will remain undisclosed. It contains a small sports facility, no more than a concrete basketball court with goals; orientation becomes difficult after nightfall but Emmanuel and Isaac offer directions before entering one of the drab, uniform three-storey blocks that occupy almost a square kilometre. The harsh glare of lights from atop each building makes five-a-side possible. Two players shudder into one another and land heavily on the rough surface. There is brief concern, inquiries quickly offered in different languages, but they are both fine. If you did not carry a certain toughness before arriving here, it helps to learn quickly.\n\u201cYou need it,\u201d says Moses*, an articulate Ugandan who is taking his turn to watch from the side. \u201cIn the end, this is just a big prison where you can work. Nobody would be here if they had any other option, and Qatar knows it. What we are seeing here is modern slavery.\u201d\n\nMoses works in security at a different mall: he has risen to a position of greater responsibility and is embarrassed when teammates who double up as colleagues shout \u201ccaptain\u201d as they run past. He has seen what happens when things get too much. A friend was taken to the edge by the combination of long hours, low pay, sometimes unsanitary living conditions and extended time away from family that are facts of everyday life here. \u201cHe was so traumatised that the only option was to send him to the bosses and insist they booked him a one-way flight home,\u201d Moses says. \u201cHe was fine when he came but Qatar changed him. Not everyone can endure it.\u201d\nThe game carries on. Lusail Stadium is 20 miles away but this is really a different universe. A young Nepali wearing an Argentina shirt arrives to offer at least something in common, scores, laughs and leaves again soon after. Play will continue for hours more with a changing cast: football after work, or before it if you are on nights, is the only physical outlet in the camp.\nThere is not always time for it. Moses usually worked 12-hour days before the World Cup, essentially becoming 14 when travel was factored in, with no extra payment. He tells of an event this year, run by a major Qatari sporting organisation, that demanded security staff work until the final guests had left. That meant finishing at about 2am every day, returning to work on the 5am bus. \u201cThose who complained had their contracts terminated,\u201d he says. \u201cYou can\u2019t do anything against our bosses here. You can only go, get up again and work the next day.\u201d\nDuring Qatar 2022, Moses\u2019s days were reduced to eight hours. The impact on his lifestyle and mental wellbeing has, he says, been marked. \u201cWe\u2019ll see whether or not it stays that way. I\u2019m sure things will change because of the World Cup, and not in a positive way. I expect things to return to how they were before. A period of 29 days cannot change what\u2019s been happening for the last five or 10 years.\u201d\nMoses is, like several others, happy to share his experiences. Some are warier and others, such as the Kenyan man sitting on a broken-down motorcycle five minutes from the pitch, say they cannot trust anyone. But there is a consensus that, while the focus diverts from Qatar\u2019s glittering carnival of football, the conversation around workers\u2019 conditions must not end.\nBeing forgotten is the worst thing that could happen to people such as Geoffrey*, a tall and deeply spoken Ghanaian who lives alongside eight compatriots in an apartment with a tiny common space and three single\u2011sized bedrooms. Each holds a three-tiered bunk bed and this is comfortable by labour camp standards, both here and elsewhere. Geoffrey knows of equally small rooms housing five or six men. Illnesses run riot in such conditions; in 2020, Amnesty International raised the alarm about the danger caused by Covid\u201119 in the area\u2019s camps.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important to remember us,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen people get to know what we are going through here, maybe bodies like the WHO or UN can help us. But the biggest thing for me is about the salaries: it\u2019s very tough.\u201d\nEach month Geoffrey, who also cleans at a mall, earns the minimum wage of 1,000 riyals (\u00a3225). It is barely enough to survive on, even when an extra subsidy for accommodation and a small allowance for food are added, when you are here to provide for your family. Social activities such as watching football in the fan zone intended for workers are off the agenda: Geoffrey and his roommates were reduced to watching World Cup games on any phone that could stream them. He describes himself as \u201clonely and bored\u201d and laughs when asked about daily life in general. Plenty is being held back.\nQatar introduced the salary threshold last year but several workers who spoke with the Guardian said it was not always adhered to and that employees routinely pay scant attention to the government\u2019s reforms. Isaac, whose example seems among the starkest, elaborates. \u201cI don\u2019t mind Qatar as a country but a lot of companies are doing bad things and the government doesn\u2019t know,\u201d he says. \u201cThey don\u2019t pay you or they treat you badly. That\u2019s the problem we are facing.\u201d\nNowadays migrant workers can report abuses such as missed wage packets to the ministry of labour, anonymously in theory, but Isaac says he knows of cases where an employee has been paid after the government\u2019s intervention only to be identified by the company and dismissed. One of the most common sanctions mentioned to the Guardian is some companies\u2019 habit of docking a worker two days\u2019 salary for missing a day\u2019s work, which is not uncommon due to physical or mental fatigue.\nIsaac may put the onus on his managers but others are more critical of Qatar. A frequent theme is alleged racism displayed towards African workers. They tend not to mix with their Asian counterparts beyond work, despite living in adjacent quarters, and believe they are regarded differently by locals. Kwame*, who lives with Geoffrey and is a carpentry assistant for a construction firm, describes the feeling of being treated as an underclass. \u201cWhat do Qataris give us?\u201d he asks. \u201cNothing. They treat us like we aren\u2019t human, like we\u2019re pieces of shit. \u2018Kachara\u2019 [\u2018garbage\u2019], they shout at us. The attitude is that we barely exist.\u201d\nMoses, in several tales of everyday life patrolling his mall, offers a similar impression. For a degree of balance he says some families bring him food from its restaurants, and suggests better-travelled locals behave more kindly. But the discrimination he sees in plain sight breeds a different worry: he is obliged to live in an all-male environment and wonders what women working in household jobs in Qatar are subjected to behind closed doors.\nThe overriding sense is that, while Qatar has bragged wildly about the success of its tournament, it has staged a show intended for anyone but the low-paid migrants who have risked their wellbeing to keep it running smoothly. \u201cThe World Cup wasn\u2019t for me,\u201d Geoffrey says. \u201cIt was about the Qataris, not us. We\u2019re the labourers. It has made history for them, they can always point to what happened. But they wanted to be famous, and we were used for that.\u201d\nFootball will have little meaning for Isaac until he has money to enjoy it in even the simplest way, but he attempts a positive note. \u201cIt\u2019s life,\u201d he says. \u201cYou just have to keep working hard.\u201d The bus will be waiting again in nine hours.\n* Names have been changed to protect their identity."

                    "body": "This article is part of the Guardian\u2019s World Cup 2022 Experts\u2019 Network, a cooperation between some of the best media organisations from the 32 countries who qualified. theguardian.com is running previews from two countries each day in the run-up to the tournament kicking off on 20 November.\nThe plan\nTwenty-six monoliths were installed across historic sites across Wales, from Cardiff Castle to Caerleon Roman Baths, to represent each player in the squad at last year\u2019s European Championship and depending on how things go at a first World Cup since 1958 the conversation could soon turn to statues. For Gareth Bale, a five-time Champions League winner, wearing the dragon on his chest and the captain\u2019s armband around his bicep at a World Cup marks the final box to tick on his footballing bucket list.\nAfter navigating nerve-shredding playoffs against Austria and Ukraine earlier this year, Wales could be forgiven for wanting to enjoy the experience. They have qualified for three of the past four major tournaments, single-handedly sparking the renaissance of the bucket hat now synonymous with the team in the process, and while expectations have undoubtedly increased they head to Qatar unfazed and unburdened. They gave Belgium and Netherlands a fright in recent Nations League encounters with their fearless approach and will quietly fancy their chances of getting out of Group B, which concludes with the small matter of a mouthwatering tie against neighbours England.\n\nWales are set to line up with a three-man defence, allowing rampant wing-backs Connor Roberts and Neco Williams to flood forward and Bale to operate from his favoured right flank. Bale insists he will arrive from stateside in peak fitness despite only playing more than 60 minutes twice since joining Los Angeles FC in the summer. Another major concern is the fitness of Joe Allen, who has been absent since September with a hamstring problem.\nThe vibrancy of this Wales squad, much of which stems from the Nottingham Forest pair Williams and Brennan Johnson, is a cause for optimism but their strength is in the collective, hence Rob Page\u2019s willingness to select players from the fourth tier such as Chris Gunter and Jonny Williams, both of whom were influential during the incredible run to the Euro 2016 semi-finals.\nRegardless of what happens this winter, Page has said his valuable core of 30-somethings \u2013 from Bale to Aaron Ramsey and Wayne Hennessey \u2013 have promised him they won\u2019t all step away from their country in one swoop. \u201cWe want Gareth to stay involved as long as he can,\u201d Page said. \u201cYou can\u2019t go from them having a big influence to a big chunk of them leaving.\u201d\n\nThe coach\nAnother World Cup \u2013 OK, a first in 64 years \u2013 and another coach that hails from the Rhondda valley. Rob Page is immensely proud of his roots in Tylorstown, a former mining village less than four miles from Pentre, the birthplace of Jimmy Murphy, who led Wales to the quarter-finals in 1958. \u201cWe were out playing kick-a-can, making games up on the street and then your mother would call you in at nine o\u2019clock for your supper,\u201d the former Watford captain recalled of his childhood. A former Port Vale and Northampton manager, Page worked with players such as Joe Rodon and Daniel James during his two years in charge of the under-21s before being promoted to Ryan Giggs\u2019s assistant in 2019. Led Wales at Euro 2020 following Giggs\u2019s arrest and signed a four-year contract after Giggs\u2019s resignation in June. Hugely respected by players and staff, Page has proved an inspirational leader.\nStar player\nWho else? As the Red Wall sings, Viva Gareth Bale. The country\u2019s all-time record goalscorer and captain is the darling of Welsh football and while they are not the one-man team often painted, Bale\u2019s influence runs deep. He was seemingly keeping his powder dry for a vintage display in victory over Austria in March, a majestic free-kick paving the way to victory, before making the difference against Ukraine in June. The big question is: could this be the last time Bale pulls on a Wales shirt? Qatar is considered the forward\u2019s footballing swansong, even if he has said he could play on until Euro 2024. \u201cI still have many years to come,\u201d the 33-year-old said after joining Los Angeles FC in July. His tendency to rise to the occasion was typified by him scoring a stoppage-time equaliser deep into extra time before LAFC beat Philadelphia Union on penalties to win the MLS Cup on 5 November. \u201cIt\u2019s always nice to score in finals, I seem to have a knack for doing that,\u201d Bale said. Was immortalised in a Cardiff mural after Wales qualified for Euro 2016.\n\nUnsung hero\nBen Davies\u2019s goal-line clearance to deny Marek Hamsik three minutes into Wales\u2019s opening game at Euro 2016 set the tone for a memorable ride to the last four of that competition but the Tottenham Hotspur defender seems to keep outdoing himself. Unafraid to put his head on the line for club or country, he delivered another heroic performance in Wales\u2019s crucial playoff final victory over Ukraine, making a box set of crucial blocks and interventions.\nProbable lineup\n\nQatar stance\nBale will be one of eight captains to wear a rainbow-coloured \u201cOneLove\u201d armband as part of an anti-discrimination initiative, though he may have to source a new one after the Football Association of Wales admitted to losing the armband in Belgium in September after Bale appeared without it against Poland four days later. Noel Mooney, the FAW\u2019s chief executive, has said they would happily take a fine on the chin for showing their support to the LGBTQ+ community if Fifa does not approve of the messaging. \u201cWe will live our values over there,\u201d Mooney said. Page held a meeting with his players on the eve of their last camp to address the importance of respecting the culture. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to unintentionally upset anyone,\u201d he said.\nNational anthem\nHearing Wales belt out Hen Wlad Fy Nhadau is one of the game\u2019s great sights and sounds. Players are versed on its meaning from a young age; in 2011 Gary Speed gave his squad both the Welsh and phonetic versions in pursuit of perfection. Written and composed by father and son Evan and James James in 1856, a statue in Ynysangharad Park in Pontypridd honours the pair. In 1977 the English FA refused to play the anthem at Wembley, leading the then Wales captain, Terry Yorath, and his teammates to link arms and sing it themselves as England\u2019s players readied for kick-off. Wales won the game 1-0.\nAll-time cult hero\nIt is difficult to look past Hal Robson-Kanu, the Acton-born former England youth forward who went to Euro 2016 a free agent and returned with a place in Welsh legend. His pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance will for ever be that giddying Cruyff turn and finish that stunned Belgium\u2019s Thomas Meunier and Marouane Fellaini in Lille to send Wales to the semi-finals. Described by Ryan Giggs as \u201can icon in Welsh football\u201d, these days Robson-Kanu, who at 33 is yet to officially retire, runs a nutrition company that sells shots of turmeric, a root from the ginger family, which he used after recovering from knee surgery as a teenager. Fans still sing his name to the tune of Salt-N-Pepa\u2019s Push It.\nBen Fishes writes for the Guardian. Follow him here on Twitter."

                    "body": "From rugby\u2019s Bledisloe Cup to netball\u2019s Constellation Cup, matches between Australia and New Zealand tend to have a bit more fire than most. As the two nations opened their campaign at the Women\u2019s T20 World Cup, even the backdrop was dramatic: the mountains of Paarl rising up behind the ground and the sunset sensing the occasion, casting deep reds and oranges over Boland Park.  But while the scene was set for drama, the Australians appeared in the mood for a light-hearted romp, taking a dominant 97-run win over their trans-Tasman rivals, despite a batting performance that will have them asking some questions before the remainder of their pool games. Australia had well and truly earned their favourites tag going into the tournament, but a shock loss to Ireland in a warm-up game \u2013 even though they tinkered with their line-up and retired batters \u2013 gave New Zealand an inkling that there were weaknesses to attack. Snaring Beth Mooney for a duck in the first over only heightened their resolve, but from there Australia settled, with Alyssa Healy and Meg Lanning seeing out a 70-run partnership. It was a good, but not clinical, batting performance from Australia. While they kept the run rate up, wickets fell regularly after Lanning was dismissed and Megan Schutt and Darcie Brown \u2013 batting at 10 and 11 \u2013 looked almost surprised to find themselves out at the crease. It was a match that demonstrated the importance of depth within a squad, and even outside of it \u2013 Australia could have assembled a second team to challenge this World Cup, with players across the Women\u2019s Big Bash League knocking down the door of selection. Every wicket New Zealand took brought on another batter with just as much determination and belief. While Brown and Schutt rarely see the middle with bat in hand for Australia, they are more than capable. With the backing of their team, they kept the run rate ticking over until the final ball.  In contrast, after New Zealand lost both their experienced openers in Suzie Bates and Sophie Devine for ducks to Schutt in the first over, they looked rattled. The Black Ferns needed to slow their scoring rate to avoid losing more wickets, and from the start nothing was going their way. A controversial call from the third umpire cost them a third wicket when a ball looked to drop short of Brown in the field, but was judged to have been caught to cost Bernadine Bezuidenhout her wicket, just as she started to build momentum. The slow scoring rate left New Zealand with a mountain of work that looked as insurmountable as those looming over the ground. They left themselves with no choice but to take risks and Australia pounced on every opportunity. Only Bezuidenhout (14), Amelia Kerr (21) and Jess Kerr (10) managed to scratch their way to double figures as Ashleigh Gardner made up for a lacklustre batting performance by excelling with the ball, taking career best figures of 5-12 from her three overs. Despite the dominance that earned her player-of-the-match honours, Gardner took the performance in her stride, crediting the work of the entire bowling unit. \u201cI think we started exactly the way we wanted to with the ball and I was just lucky enough to take those wickets at the end,\u201d she said. New Zealand captain Devine was frank in her assessment of their performance. \u201cI thought we were really poor today in all facets of the game,\u201d she said. \u201cI thought Lea Tahuhu was great with the ball, Amelia Kerr was outstanding, and 170 was always going to be a tough chase. But the way we went about it, losing the early wickets, was always going to be hard work. Really disappointing, that\u2019s probably the only way to sum it up.\u201d New Zealand now have two days before they take on South Africa, while Australia march on to play Bangladesh in pursuit of a third consecutive T20 World Cup win."

                    "body": "Graham Arnold will lead the Socceroos through to the conclusion of the 2026 World Cup campaign after the coach eschewed interest from Europe and the Middle East to sign a new contract with Football Australia. The governing body confirmed on Monday that Arnold will remain in his post for another four-year cycle during which he will attempt to guide Australia to Asian Cup success and to a sixth consecutive World Cup \u2013 where he aims to deliver an even better performance than last year. The Socceroos\u2019 thrilling run to the last 16 at the tournament in Qatar meant a new deal was always likely to be tabled. FA had not spoken to any other potential candidates while Arnold took an extended post-World Cup break and and a decision whether to stay in charge or pursue a new challenge ultimately came down to 59-year-old himself.  A sense of patriotism and the opportunity to further improve a team that has already exceeded expectations trumped any other offers Arnold received, and he outlined a clear three-stage plan for the next three-and-a-half years. Winning the Asian Cup for the second time in 2024 will be a top priority, followed by a less circuitous route to qualification for the 2026 World Cup. Progress beyond the last 16 once at the tournament in the US, Canada and Mexico would complete Arnold\u2019s wish list. \u201cEvery time I put on the shirt or am around the Socceroos, I bleed green and gold,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s always a special moment. I have so much belief in the players and the staff. Qatar was a fantastic achievement but it was just the start and there\u2019s plenty more to come.  \u201cI had interest from overseas, but I want to help Australia and Australian kids. I said to JJ [FA CEO James Johnson] if I did consider to stay on \u2013 and I want to stay on \u2013 it\u2019s not just about the Socceroos.\u201d A broader remit under the terms of his new contract will see Arnold provide mentorship to the coaches of Australia\u2019s men\u2019s youth national teams, support chief football officer Ernie Merrick with talent identification, and work with FA to ensure football at all levels has access to the best facilities and infrastructure.  He said he would also use his position to push for increased government funding, improved training facilities and a stadium the Socceroos could call home. \u201cIt\u2019s crazy to think the Socceroos don\u2019t get any high performance funding from the government,\u201d he said. \u201cThey don\u2019t have a home. How can you have a football culture if you don\u2019t have a home. Funding will help the programs but the home of football is crucial. It\u2019s something as a sport we\u2019ve missed out on. We\u2019ve got nothing, nowhere to go.\u201d The new deal completes a remarkable turnaround for the 59-year-old, whose job came under threat at one point during qualification for Qatar 2022, only for him to emerge as a national hero after taking his side to their best finish at the global showpiece event. Before the blip that threatened to derail the Socceroos\u2019 qualification hopes and led to intense scrutiny on his position, the team had made history by becoming the first to win 11 consecutive matches in a single qualification campaign \u2013 despite them playing just four of 20 qualifiers on home soil. Once in Qatar, the Socceroos won two group stage matches, including against then world No 10 side Denmark, before eventually bowing out in the last 16 with defeat to eventual champions Argentina. \u201cWhat Graham and the entire squad achieved under the most challenging of circumstances during the last Fifa World Cup campaign was exceptional, and we are delighted that we have secured his services for a further four years,\u201d FA chair Chris Nikou said. \u201cFootball Australia is ambitious, where we expect continued progress and results from our senior and youth national teams, and through our discussions with Graham over recent weeks, we know our thinking is aligned on the future direction of Australian football and the Socceroos.\u201d Arnold will retain his assistant Ren\u00e9 Meulensteen as he seeks continuity in the Socceroos set-up, with World Cup qualifiers resuming in November and the delayed 2023 Asian Cup to be confirmed to take place in Qatar in early 2024."

                    "body": "This article is part of the Guardian\u2019s World Cup 2022 Experts\u2019 Network, a cooperation between some of the best media organisations from the 32 countries who qualified. theguardian.com is running previews from two countries each day in the run-up to the tournament kicking off on 20 November.\nThe plan\nDefensive solidity and scoring goals on counterattacks have been the main characteristics of Team Melli for some time and helped Carlos Queiroz shape his unprecedented popularity during his first stint in charge between 2011 and 2019. At the 2014 and 2018 World Cups they came up against some of the great football powerhouses but lost 1-0 to Argentina in Brazil and 1-0 to Spain in Russia, where they also drew 1-1 with Portugal. The performance against Lionel Messi\u2019s Argentina impressed Iranians back home so much there were celebrations in the streets after the narrow defeat.\nThe big downside of Queiroz\u2019s tactics was that Iran struggled to score goals against so-called weaker opposition. They were not able to dominate games and when they did throw players forward the defence was vulnerable; in Queiroz\u2019s last game of his first spell Iran conceded a sloppy goal against Japan in the semi-final of the 2019 Asian Cup and when they then pressed for an equaliser, they let in a further two goals.\n\nQueiroz, of course, has not changed completely. The onus is still on a solid defence but the two games in September \u2013 a 1-0 win against against Uruguay and 1-1 draw with Senegal \u2013 showed Iran are trying to play more from the back and press the opponent higher up the pitch.\nThey are likely to play in a 4-1-4-1 formation at the World Cup and the main question concerns who plays up front. Sardar Azmoun would be the favourite but he has been injured. If he is not fit, Mehdi Taremi is likely to step in. If Azmoun can play, Taremi is likely to start as a left winger.\n\nThe coach\nCarlos Queiroz. Sir Alex Ferguson\u2019s former right-hand man is so popular among Iranian football fans that they did not have any issue with him replacing Dragan Skocic, who won 15 out of his 18 games in charge and got the country to the World Cup in record time before he was sacked earlier this year. Not even the farcical circumstances in which Queiroz returned dampened the mood. This is the third time Queiroz will lead Iran at a World Cup but this time it was Iran who got him there rather than the other way around. In fact he had failed to reach Qatar with Colombia and Egypt. If things go well he may well extend his short-term contract and stay on for next summer\u2019s Asian Cup, which is also in Qatar.\nStar player\n\u201cI regret that this boy did not go to European football much earlier. It\u2019s all my fault,\u201d Mehdi Taremi\u2019s father cried on a TV show a few months ago and his thoughts echoed those of pretty much everyone in Iran. After years of scoring in Iran and Qatar he finally made the move to Portugal in 2019, joining Rio Ave before a transfer to Porto a year later. He averages about a goal every other game in Europe, and for Iran. Taremi, 30, has come a long way since a last-minute miss for his country against Portugal at the 2018 World Cup. He appears to be getting better and takes comfort from the fact that all recent Ballon d\u2019Or winners have been 30 years or older.\n\nUnsung hero\nWhen Saeed Ezatolahi moved to Atl\u00e9tico Madrid\u2019s B side as a 17-year-old in 2014 everyone expected him to have a brilliant club career ahead of him. It may not have turned out quite like that \u2013 he is now with Vejle in Denmark having spent a considerable amount of time in Russia \u2013 but it is a different story with Team Melli. He is a certain starter for Iran, his work rate appreciated by everyone. His absence was keenly felt in Iran\u2019s first game at Russia 2018 and Queiroz will hope he won\u2019t have the same headache this time.\nProbable lineup\n\nQatar stance\nIran has had tense relationships with several Arab countries in recent years but Qatar has been a rare ally and the impact they have had on the football world is serving as a role model for Iranians. There is nothing but praise for Qatar among Iranian football figures and there are many who think the migrant worker situation is not as bad as western media paints it. Iranian fans may well have banners protesting over something in Qatar, but it won\u2019t be about the workers.\nNational anthem\nIran\u2019s current national anthem, Sorude Melliye Jomhuriye Eslamiye Iran, is the second it has had after the Islamic revolution in 1979. The first was too long so in 1990 the government decided to replace it with a shorter one. The famous poet and songwriter Sayed Bagheri wrote the lyrics and Hassan Riahi composed the music, although some accused him of copying South Korea\u2019s national anthem (to be fair they have quite a bit in common). The lyrics refer to the Islamic revolution and in the final line express the hope that the Islamic republic of Iran will survive for ever. This is something fans may protest against and try to challenge in Qatar.\nAll-time cult hero\nWho else but the man who was the top scorer in the world at international level until Cristiano Ronaldo broke his 109-goal-record last year? Nearly two decades after his last appearance for Team Melli, Ali Daei (his nickname Shahriar means \u201cThe King\u201d in farsi) is still the poster boy of Iranian football. He was one of eight Fifa legends taking part in the draw for the Qatar World Cup but has been banned from coaching for three years after an outburst against a club president. Has been supportive of the recent protests in the country and had his passport seized by the authorities for a week.\nBehnam Jafarzadeh is the deputy editor of varzesh3.com.

                    "body": "Enrique Macaya M\u00e1rquez, the legendary Argentinian broadcaster, the voice of football in his country for as long as anyone can care to remember, plots the timeline with his hands. He begins with Alfredo Di St\u00e9fano. \u201cFor me he was the best player of them all,\u201d Macaya M\u00e1rquez says. \u201cAlthough I suppose it depends on the era. I saw Johan Cruyff as being like Di St\u00e9fano \u2026 So, Di St\u00e9fano, Pel\u00e9, Cruyff, Maradona, Messi. On that timeline. They are the top five.\u201d Macaya M\u00e1rquez is impeccably placed to comment. He grew up with Di St\u00e9fano and was close enough to Diego Maradona to be invited to his wedding in 1989. \u201cMaradona used to tell me that, when he became a manager, he would take me as his assistant coach,\u201d he adds.  Macaya M\u00e1rquez has stories to tell about them all, and many, many more \u2013 gathered over an impossibly rich professional lifetime. He is here in Qatar, about to analyse Sunday\u2019s final between his country and France, having commentated at every World Cup since 1958. This is his 17th finals; no other journalist has done so many. He celebrated his 88th birthday when he covered Qatar v Ecuador on the opening day. What stands out when spending time with him is his humility and serenity. His fellow countrymen and women have come to consider him as a kind of grandparental sage, the old guy in the cafe who will tell them all about the game with unerring insight and accuracy. They will be with him when he works the final for DirecTV Sports, hoping and praying, like him, that Argentina can win the tournament for a third time. And, in the process, consecrate Lionel Messi as Maradona\u2019s equal. Macaya M\u00e1rquez remembers the second triumph as the most emotional and that is saying something given the circumstances around the first in 1978 \u2013 the political turmoil in Argentina as the team went on their victorious run on home soil. It is because the glory of Mexico 86 was also his glory, in part.  Macaya M\u00e1rquez is a comentarista by trade, but it is something of a false friend in linguistic terms for the English speaker. In Argentina, the play-by-play commentator is the relator, the narrator, while the comentarista provides the tactical analysis. Macaya M\u00e1rquez goes way back with Carlos Bilardo, the Argentina manager who steered Maradona and Co to the trophy. \u201cI worked for a radio station in La Plata when Bilardo played for Estudiantes in the late 1960s and we became good friends,\u201d he says. \u201cWe spoke about football and strategy over the years and so after the 1986 final, my colleagues in South America came to congratulate me, saying that I had a big influence on Bilardo and winning the World Cup. I just told them I didn\u2019t play. I didn\u2019t lift the trophy.\u201d Macaya M\u00e1rquez did get his hands on it when he was one of only two journalists on the team flight back to Buenos Aires. \u201cI just remember the singing,\u201d he says. \u201cBefore the World Cup, there was a conflict between the Argentine Football Association and the players and, on the way home, the players sang against them. They sang that the management were like pancakes: they flip one way and then the other.\u201d  It is not difficult to imagine who led that chant and, where Maradona was concerned, Macaya M\u00e1rquez offers the impression that arguments were inevitable. They had a classic encounter on TV in the early 1990s. \u201cArgentina had a friendly in Japan and I became aware that Maradona and the players did not want to travel,\u201d Macaya M\u00e1rquez says. \u201cI said into the camera that they had to go. Maradona was on the show and he said that Macaya M\u00e1rquez knows nothing, nada, nada. Because when Maradona got home, he did not even have the strength to lift his children, he was so tired. \u201cThe truth was that he and the players were out partying. I never asked about that sort of thing. My job was to analyse the games. But I told Maradona that they had to train more and train harder. Then maybe he would have the power to lift his kids.  \u201cMaradona did not agree. But afterwards he realised that I had a point. So he asked me for a coffee and he got a TV crew along to film him apologising to me. It was special.\u201d Macaya M\u00e1rquez became a household name through television \u2013 in particular, as the co-presenter of Futbol de Primera in the 90s, the Argentinian Sunday-night institution. It had started for him in radio. He was 23 years old when he was sent to cover the 1958 World Cup in Sweden for Radio Belgrano. At the very beginning, though, there were newspapers. Aged just seven, Macaya M\u00e1rquez had a paper round in his Buenos Aires neighbourhood of Flores. \u201cDi St\u00e9fano lived there, too,\u201d he says. \u201cHe was seven, eight years older than me but we played football together at his house. We were friends. Di St\u00e9fano would come to my newspaper kiosk and I\u2019d let him read for free.\u201d  What are Macaya M\u00e1rquez\u2019s memories of 1958? Surely Pel\u00e9 winning the final for Brazil? \u201cHonestly, it was Argentina\u2019s 6-1 defeat against Czechoslovakia,\u201d he replies. \u201cI had stopped smoking three years earlier. I started again after that. When the Argentina team got back to the airport in Buenos Aires, they were pelted with coins.\u201d An Argentina triumph on Sunday would complete a rare hat-trick for Macaya M\u00e1rquez, and the thought occurs that it could add up to a glorious swan song. Because this will be his last World Cup, right? \u201cMmm \u2026 it\u2019s possible,\u201d he says, a smile spreading across his lips. What he actually means is possibly not."

After being part of England\u2019s World Cup squad the 27-year-old was given time off but when he returned to City was not in the condition to train, according to the manager. Phillips\u2019s fellow England squad members in Qatar \u2013 Phil Foden, Jack Grealish and John Stones \u2013 all featured against Liverpool while Kyle Walker was an unused sub, but the former Leeds midfielder did not even make the matchday squad.  \u201cHe\u2019s not injured,\u201d Guardiola said. \u201cHe arrived overweight. I don\u2019t know [why]. He didn\u2019t arrive in the condition to do training sessions and to play.\u201d When asked if this was a surprise as Phillips had been with England and the national team\u2019s department of nutritionists which should have ensured he was kept in optimum shape, the manager said: \u201cAbsolutely [this should be the case]. That\u2019s why he cannot play. When he will be ready, he will play, because we need him, we need him a lot.\u201dGuardiola would not be drawn on whether he was disappointed with Phillips being out of shape, just saying that \u201cit\u2019s a private conversation with Kalvin\u201d.It is the latest setback for Phillips at City after he signed from Leeds United in the summer for an initial \u00a342m on a six-year contract. After making three substitute appearances in August and September, a recurrence of a shoulder problem he suffered at Leeds forced him to have surgery and he was subsequently ruled out for two months.Phillips made only one further City appearance \u2013 as a 50th-minute replacement in November\u2019s 2-0 Carabao Cup win over Chelsea at the Etihad Stadium \u2013 before Gareth Southgate selected him in the 26-man England squad for Qatar 2022. There he played twice, in the 3-0 group win over Wales and 3-0 last-16 win over Senegal.City\u2019s next match is Wednesday\u2019s trip to Leeds but whether he will be available for selection to face his former club is unclear. City then host Everton on New Year\u2019s Eve before playing Chelsea twice in succession \u2013 at Stamford Bridge on 5 January in the league and three days later at home in the FA Cup."

                    "body": "The United States men\u2019s national team arrived at the Estadio Nacional de Costa Rica on Wednesday having all but qualified for the 2022 Fifa World Cup. Seated in second place with 25 points with a comfortable advantage on goal difference, a win, draw or loss by anything fewer than six goals would have been enough to get them over the line. Had lightning struck, the worst-case scenario was an intercontinental playoff with New Zealand in June. Redemption for 2017\u2019s failed World Cup qualification felt imminent, but focus on the task at hand never waned in camp. \u201cWe still have a job to do\u201d was the refrain echoing from head coach Gregg Berhalter to key players Tyler Adams, Tim Weah and Deandre Yedlin throughout the run-up to Tuesday\u2019s Concacaf qualifying finale. And despite the math that weighed heavily in their favor, Berhalter and co on Wednesday put to rest speculation the team would rotate players or be happy with a draw. The task was qualification, but the manner of qualification mattered. The players conveyed a desire to win, to make a point, to leave a mark, to do what every US team before them had failed to do: win a World Cup qualifying match away in Costa Rica.  As for the hosts, the atmosphere was celebratory and hopeful. The 35,062-seat bandbox was packed and cheering. After a remarkable run of five wins and one draw in their final six matches, Los Ticos had elbowed their way into qualifying contention. They entered Wednesday\u2019s match poised to snag the fourth-place playoff spot and, no doubt looking forward strategically toward that match, they sat a number of key players, including Joel Campbell and Bryan Oviedo, to guard against potential yellow card accumulation that would sit them out of that one-off in June. The United States out-possessed the Costa Ricans ever so slightly during a scoreless first half. They eclipsed them in free kick and corner accrual, winning seven corners but converting none. They looked threatening in places and did good work getting the ball forward, especially from the right side. They held Costa Rica well defensively and were setting the pace of the match. The opening minutes of the second half saw the United States\u2019 best chance on goal. It felt like the moment the Americans would take the lead, capitalizing on the momentum built in the first half and sending the US on their way to make history in qualifying. Miles Robinson was well positioned in front of net looking threatening, where he received a cross and sent it toward net with a header that felt assured to slot in were it not for an incredible save from Keylor Navas. And with that save, the lights went out. Moments later, Costa Rica won a corner on the opposite end of the pitch. Brandon Aguilera took the attempt, sending it to Juan Pablo Vargas who catapulted it past US goalkeeper Zack Steffen, putting Costa Rica ahead in the 51st. In a match that ultimately came down to capitalizing and defending on set pieces, the United States had taken seven corners by then and came away with nothing \u2013 and Costa Rica had just converted its third corner into a goal.  The momentum shift on the pitch and in the stands was immediate. Eight minutes later, Anthony Contreras snuck in behind Antonee Robinson to tap in Costa Rica\u2019s second goal off another cross before a delirious crowd. Still fighting, still hoping, Berhalter sent in three subs immediately. Jesus Ferreira, Giovanni Reyna and Shaq Moore entered, joining Luca de la Torre who had gone in at the half as substitutions. But the USA would never quite regain the momentum or control the pace of the match. They won a handful more corners, but again failed to make anything out of them. They pushed the ball forward and kept on the attack, but were slowed by fouls and tight defending. The crowd roared behind the home team, sending the momentum their way. Los Ticos looked goal-dangerous until the last whistle. The match ended 2-0 in favor of the hosts. Despite the outcome, despite failure to grasp hold of history with their first ever qualifying win in Costa Rica, the United States completed the essential task before them, the one they set out to achieve eight months ago in El Salvador: officially punching their ticket to Qatar 2022. Canada, who secured their first World Cup trip since 1986 with a win on Sunday, finished top of the group with 28 points after a 1-0 loss at Panama. Mexico won 2-0 against El Salvador to move ahead of the US into second place and clinch their eighth straight World Cup appearance."

The former president, meanwhile, said he was \u201cnot going to partake\u201d in a possible indictment.  \u201cI\u2019m no lawyer, but I didn\u2019t realize that was one of the options,\u201d the Late Show host said. \u201cThe subject does not want to partake in the investigation \u2013 \u2018your honor, while admittedly the prosecution does have overwhelming evidence of his guilt, my client pleads: not feeling it.\u2019\u201d Over the weekend, Twitter\u2019s new owner, Elon Musk, reinstated Trump\u2019s account, which had been deactivated since January 6. \u201cNo, Elon, I won\u2019t go back!\u201d Colbert fumed. \u201cThe racism, the misspelling, the calls to violence, the dot dot dots. Remember the fucking covfefe? You know what? I am not going to partake in it.\u201d  The billionaire CEO based his decision on a public Twitter poll, in which Trump\u2019s reinstatement garnered a slim majority. \u201cSo Musk goes, based on a 1.8% majority in a completely made-up poll littered with bots, \u2018I\u2019m super cool reinstating a maniac whose last tweets celebrated a violent coup attempt on Capitol Hill,\u2019\u201d Colbert explained. \u201cAnd in return for that complete moral debasement, the former president said: no thanks,\u201d preferring instead to stick with his beleaguered social media venture Truth Social. The host then turned to the World Cup held in Qatar, \u201ca choice made by Fifa, which is, and I don\u2019t want to overstate this, the most corrupt organization in the history of the world\u201d. According to the US justice department, Fifa allegedly awarded the tournament to Qatar, a desert country with extreme heat, following a series of bribes. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I don\u2019t care who hears me \u2013 I\u2019m going to stand up here on national television and say that about Fifa every night,\u201d he said, \u201cunless it turns out that Fifa is a sponsor.\u201d Besides the heat, Qatar has an atrocious human rights record, from the persecution of LGBTQ+ people, severely curtailed rights for women and a system of forced labor by migrant workers. Fifa tried to paper over any controversy by assuring that \u201ceveryone is welcome\u201d to the World Cup, though the Qatari government warned LGBTQ+ fans against \u201cpublic displays of affection\u201d and barred fans from being shirtless during matches or in public settings. \u201cNo problem, I can\u2019t imagine anyone at a soccer game would ever go shirtless,\u201d Colbert deadpanned over a photo of a shirtless Lionel Messi. Seth Meyers  On Late Night, Seth Meyers looked into the new special counsel appointed by the attorney general, Merrick Garland, to oversee investigations into Trump. \u201cIf you\u2019re keeping track at home, we\u2019re now on our second special counsel looking into whether Donald Trump, a notoriously corrupt criminal authoritarian dipshit, broke any laws,\u201d Meyers explained. The new special counsel, Jack Smith, is \u201cby all accounts and also by his name, a no-nonsense, tough-as-nails prosecutor who will follow the facts and not be intimidated,\u201d said Meyers. \u201cWhich is the same thing they said about Robert Mueller. Which is cool, I guess, but where did that get us? \u201cI mean, Mueller outlined 10 different allegations of obstruction of justice, not to mention actual proof that Trump\u2019s campaign openly encouraged foreign interference in the election, and then all Trump had to do was lean into the mic and say, \u2018wrong,\u2019 and that was it.\u201d Trump has already begun complaining about the appointment, lamenting the \u201cegregiously corrupt\u201d Biden administration and its \u201cweaponized department of justice\u201d during a speech at Mar-a-Lago this weekend. The rambling address was aired but then dropped by C-Span. \u201cEven C-Span cut away!\u201d Meyers marveled. \u201cThis is the network famous for showing wide shots of empty chairs, and even they were like, \u2018This shit is boring.\u2019\u201d Jimmy Kimmel  And in Los Angeles, Jimmy Kimmel mocked the former president\u2019s response to the new special counsel appointee, Jack Smith, who \u201clooks like a guy who would sentence Chewbacca to death\u201d. While hosting a gala for a conservative thinktank this weekend, Trump described himself as \u201cone of the most honest and innocent people ever in our country\u201d. \u201cYou have to admit, that was funny,\u201d Kimmel laughed. Meanwhile, despite his reinstatement from Elon Musk, Trump has yet to return to Twitter. \u201cYou know how badly you have to screw up Twitter to make Donald Trump refuse to go on it?\u201d Kimmel said. Trump vowed he would not return \u2013 \u201cwhich is a promise he\u2019ll stick to until the next time he\u2019s on the toilet for more than 20 minutes\u201d, said Kimmel \u2013 but Kanye West is back following a similar reinstatement by Musk. \u201cBetween Trump and Kanye coming back, it\u2019s like Elon Musk did a reverse exorcism on us,\u201d said Kimmel. \u201cIt\u2019s like polio and measles returning at the same time.\u201d"

                    "body": "Laura Woods is just back from Qatar but has somehow managed to fit in a visit to Manchester to interview Kevin De Bruyne, her Christmas shopping and a trip to collect her dog from the dog sitters (although, she says, it was more of a training camp because Lulu can be a little bit badly behaved at times). It has been a whirlwind month for the 35-year-old presenter, who covered the World Cup on ITV with pundits such as Gary Neville and Roy Keane, an experience she says was a coming of age.  Broadcasting is brutally competitive and very few make it to the top. Woods has worked her way up after getting her first job as a runner at Sky in 2009 but says there were times when she thought she would never make it. \u201cAt one point I decided to be a producer,\u201d she says over Zoom. \u201cI gave up on the idea of it all but remember going to the gym one night and I thought: \u2018If you don\u2019t really try you are always going to be disappointed that you didn\u2019t.\u2019 I liked producing but it didn\u2019t make me spark; I didn\u2019t get overly excited about it. I knew there was something missing and I felt that I owed it to myself to have a proper go.\u201d She knuckled down and started making her own YouTube videos in the garage. \u201cIt was such brilliant practice,\u201d she says. \u201cThen I\u2019d borrow a cameraman to do more videos and interviews and in the end I went to my boss at Sky and said: \u2018Would you put this on the YouTube channel for Sky if you like it? Don\u2019t worry if you don\u2019t like it.\u2019 Luckily he did like it and I kept on doing more and then it started to snowball from there.\u201d  Woods says she enjoyed two things at school \u2013 sports and English \u2013 but found other subjects less interesting and difficult to concentrate on. Still it took her a while to realise she could combine the two in her working life. It started with writing match reports at Kingston University for the football and rugby teams before a degree in print journalism and that first job at Sky. Her journey has not always been straightforward \u2013 it never is \u2013 and she says she can still get very nervous before a game, picking out England v Senegal at the World Cup as the match at which she felt the most anxious. Confidence is a key aspect of presenting and although Woods feels comfortable now, that has not always been the case. \u201cWhen you look at broadcasting from the outside in it can look quite daunting and as if it is a very difficult nut to crack, and it is,\u201d she says. \u201cYou have to be in the right place at the right time but you also have to be ready for it and be confident as well. And confidence comes from practice, it really does. You are never going to wake up one day and be very, very good at something straight away.  \u201cThe one thing I learned is that a listener or a reader or a viewer can all smell any inauthenticity and I figured that out really quickly. It wasn\u2019t that I wasn\u2019t trying to be me; it was more that I was struggling with the confidence a bit. But eventually I kept doing it over and over again and I got much more comfortable in my own skin. And that is the only thing you have got that no one else has \u2013 your own personality, your own way of doing things. It sounds like a cliche \u2013 just be yourself \u2013 but you really have to do that.\u201d Woods says Gabby Logan, Sue Barker and Clare Balding are three presenters she has always looked up to, not because they are women but because they are so good. One performance, by Balding at the 2012 Olympics, has stuck with Woods because it was particularly impressive. A guest had pulled out at a very late notice but Balding, unfazed, just said \u201cI\u2019ve got this\u201d and produced a seven-minute fill on her own.  \u201cI just thought: \u2018What an amazing operator.\u2019 I knew there was something about it at the time \u2013 I guess because I work in telly I can spot things like that. I knew that you wouldn\u2019t normally do that for that long on your own but she held my attention and she did it word-perfectly without making a single mistake and I thought: \u2018Wow.\u2019\u201d Covering the World Cup, says Woods, was the pinnacle of her career and she felt she was part of a real team, everyone supporting each other. Apart from the final \u2013 \u201cthe obvious choice as a highlight\u201d \u2013 she picks out Argentina v Saudi Arabia as a favourite moment, because she was outside rather than in the studio and the two sets of fans were incredibly loud. \u201cIt lifts your own performance,\u201d she says. There is no time to rest for Woods, and her focus is back on the Premier League, with her team, Arsenal, enjoying a five-point gap at the top ahead of Manchester City. Speaking to De Bruyne, though, was a stark reminder that City have been there and done it before \u2013 and are up for the chase. \u201cAt the end I asked him more as a fan than an interviewer: \u2018How annoyed are you guys that Pep Guardiola has given Arsenal a coach and some brilliant players and they are now top of the league with a bit of distance between them and yourselves?\u2019 He laughed and saw the funny side of it but they have this steely resilience about them, that belief, and he basically said that they have been ahead before and they have been behind before and they have made up lots of distance so they just do their own thing and just keep going.\u201d Woods will also keep going, whether on radio with TalkSport or TV on ITV or Amazon Prime Video. Like anyone in the public eye she gets her share of criticism, especially on social media, but she has learned to be more selective. \u201cI used to read all my tweets, when I had much fewer followers, and I used that for instant feedback, whether it was good or bad, and I found it addictive. I went on it straight away after I had done something and it became a bit like a sounding board for whether or not I had made a mistake. But I once interviewed a football manager who said: \u2018You can\u2019t get too high with the highs and you can\u2019t get too low with the lows\u2019 and I now use social media in that way too. \u201cYou know, let it be. If someone has something bad to say about you, you don\u2019t actually have to let it in. I take time away from it, I don\u2019t read all of it. I find myself typing a response and then I delete it and go: \u2018Why get involved in this now?\u2019 It is a bit like seeing a fight or an argument and you don\u2019t need to get involved. You can just walk away and have a great day.\u201d Laura Woods will present Amazon Prime Video\u2019s coverage of Aston Villa v Liverpool on Boxing Day. Prime Video will be exclusively broadcasting 10 Premier League fixtures during the festive period."

                    "body": "Australian and New Zealand football\u2019s governing bodies have said they are \u201cshocked and disappointed\u201d by reports that Fifa is set to announce that Saudi Arabia\u2019s tourism authority will be an official sponsor at the 2023 Women\u2019s World Cup. Both organisations have called on Fifa to \u201curgently clarify\u201d the situation. New Zealand Football claimed it had not been consulted, nor had next summer\u2019s World Cup co-hosts Australia, and both have joined human rights groups, including Amnesty International, in criticising the potential deal as Fifa seeks to attract brands to specifically support women\u2019s football.  Visit Saudi is set to join global brands such as Adidas, Visa and Coca-Cola in sponsoring the World Cup, which is scheduled to last from 20 July for a month across 12 cities in New Zealand and Australia, with organisers estimating that around 2 billion people will watch the tournament as the popularity of the women\u2019s game continues to rise. Fifa has been approached for comment. Saudi Arabia has been criticised for its human rights record and accused of \u201csportswashing\u201d after investing heavily in global sport, with the investment in Newcastle United and the recently formed LIV Golf tour both financed by the country\u2019s Public Investment Fund. New Zealand Football said: \u201cIf these reports prove correct, we are shocked and disappointed to hear this as [we] haven\u2019t been consulted by Fifa at all on this matter. As Fifa Women\u2019s World Cup 2023 co-hosts, New Zealand Football and Football Australia have jointly written to Fifa to urgently clarify the situation.\u201d Amnesty International UK\u2019s head of priority campaigns and individuals at risk, Felix Jakens, said: \u201cThe rolling crackdown on human rights under Mohammed bin Salman has seen brave women\u2019s rights defenders like Loujain al-Hathloul jailed, tortured and then banned from speaking publicly or leaving the country, so this latest reported effort to sportswash the country\u2019s appalling human rights record is both breathtaking and yet entirely predictable.  \u201cAfter Cristiano Ronaldo\u2019s signing, the purchase of Newcastle, the LIV Golf series and the country\u2019s hosting of numerous high-profile sporting events, Saudi Arabia\u2019s use of sport to try to mask its terrible human rights record is now a depressingly well-established pattern. \u201cWomen in Saudi Arabia face serious discrimination in marriage, divorce, inheritance and child custody rights, while Saudi women who\u2019ve dared to speak out about the need for reforms in the country have received massive jail sentences.\u201d Jakens added: \u201cFifa should speak out about the need for human rights reform in Saudi Arabia and not merely allow its premier women\u2019s tournament to be used for sportswashing, while players, coaches and fans should likewise challenge this crude exploitation of their sport by Saudi Arabia.\u201d Saudi Arabia submitted a bid last month to host the 2026 Women\u2019s Asian Cup. The Saudi Arabia Football Federation has also announced a new strategy to transform the women\u2019s game in its country and targeted a top 20 Fifa ranking in time for the 2034 World Cup. In other news Saudi Arabia has been chosen as the 2027 men\u2019s Asian Cup hosts at the Asian Football Confederation (AFC) congress in Bahrain. It will be Saudi Arabia\u2019s first staging of the event, with the decision confirmed after India, Iran, Qatar and Uzbekistan had earlier withdrawn from the bidding process. The Gulf state is thought to be very interested in hosting the men\u2019s World Cup in 2030, potentially in a joint bid alongside Greece and Egypt. Delegates at the AFC congress also re-elected the incumbent president, Bahrain\u2019s Sheikh Salman bin Ebrahim Al Khalifa, for another four-year term."

                    "body": "Was it the expectations? Was it the armbands? Was it the tinkering? Or did Denmark just not have what it took to progress as expected at this World Cup? The postmortem can now begin for the team ranked 10th in the world, because Kasper Hjulmand\u2019s men are going home.\nTheir second defeat was in keeping with all but brief periods of their two other matches in Qatar: insipid. A team that had stormed their way to the semi-finals of the European Championship last year, and romped through qualification, didn\u2019t look as if they had the belief to win a game against Australia.\n\nLast year Denmark were driven by unique factors absent from this World Cup. Most important was the desire to play for their stricken playmaker Christian Eriksen, but there was also the effect of playing at home during the group stages, in front of crowds who were similarly animated. Here in the Gulf Danish fans are in short supply and they were outnumbered by Aussies at the Al Janoub stadium. Eriksen, meanwhile, is restored to the side but has proven far from the talisman of previous years.\nDenmark have also been denied a second cause to play for this year. Among the European nations who have spoken out on issues of migrant labour rights and LGBTQ+ equality, Denmark have been perhaps the most vocal. They agreed to wear the OneLove armband and produced versions of their training and playing kits that would acknowledge the deaths of migrant workers caused by this tournament. But none of the items have been worn.\n\nFifa\u2019s late, unspecified threat of sporting sanctions against players who wore the armband was accompanied by a straightforward \u201cno political messaging\u201d ban on the training gear. Unlike Australia, who concentrated on delivering their own \u2013 powerful \u2013 video message before the tournament, Denmark found themselves deprived of their plan and unable to create an alternative. After the opening draw against Tunisia, Hjulmand said the affair had disconcerted his players. On Wednesday he strongly denied it was still an issue. But regular Danish observers, watching a team so unlike themselves, said they were not so sure.\nHjulmand did admit his team had been affected mentally, acknowledging composure had been lacking against Australia. \u201cWe haven\u2019t played with the right tempo and rhythm,\u201d he said. \u201cThe structure just went out of the match and we were too emotional. The thing we shouldn\u2019t do is play with emotion in a match like this, we should play with quality. But the football sucked.\u201d\n\nThe absence of Simon Kj\u00e6r will not have helped in terms of mental resilience, the captain proving so crucial in galvanising Denmark last year. But it was surely also the case that Hjulmand made some bad decisions during the tournament.\nSpeaking after the match the coach did not stint in criticising the levels of performance. \u201cIt\u2019s a big disappointment and it\u2019s not going to be good to look back on,\u201d he said. But when he does pore over the videos \u2013 providing the Danish Football Association does not intercede first \u2013 Hjulmand may reflect on why he had clearly not settled on a preferred attacking system before the tournament, instead changing shape and personnel up front for each of the three matches, with an attendant shift in approach.\nAgainst Australia, his team needed to win but a decision to abandon the familiar back three in favour of a four did not provide a greater attacking impetus. Instead, it not only appeared to stymie the attacking forays of his wing-backs but left his team open to the counter, something exacerbated when a double substitution led to the system switching from 4-2-3-1 to 4-1-4-1 on the hour. The Socceroos finally exploited the vulnerability a minute later, breaking three on three for the winning goal.\nTactics played their part, and a lack of a sharp striking option surely cost Denmark, too. Ultimately, though, it seems that what undermined this team the most was something going on inside them and, right now, only they know what it was."

There will be 64 games played, perhaps averaging about 100 minutes per game, or roughly 6,400 minutes. Since 2010, including during the construction of the eight stadiums, more than 6,000 migrant workers are reported to have died. That amounts to roughly one migrant worker death for every minute of football played. Every minute will be a funeral lament for a worker who was forced (by circumstance or negligence and brutal greed) to sacrifice their life. How anyone can participate in such a long funeral (and have fun doing so) is a statement of how inhumane society has become.

Fifa is expected to confirm that Visit Saudi will join international brands such as Adidas, Coca-Cola and Visa in attaching its name to the 32-team tournament that will kick off in front of an expected 50,000 supporters at Auckland\u2019s Eden Park on 20 July. The deal has been agreed under Fifa\u2019s new \u201ccommercial partnership structure\u201d dedicated to developing revenues specifically for the women\u2019s game, with funds generated from the World Cup going back into the sport. There will be some scepticism over the suitability of the arrangement, owing to repression of women\u2019s freedoms in the Gulf state.  A number of legal changes have improved women\u2019s rights in Saudi Arabia in recent years, including the end of a ban on driving and amendments to the oppressive guardianship law that would allow, for the first time, women to apply for official documents such as a passport and to travel abroad independently. The guardianship law has not been abolished, however, and women still need the consent of a man to get married and obtain certain forms of healthcare. Male guardians can also bring legal action against women for \u2018disobedience\u2019 and being absent from home. Women\u2019s football in the country has seen unequivocal change. A decade ago, Saudi officials were calling for a ban on the hijab in football, which would have prevented observant women from playing the game, and in 2017 women were still banned from attending matches as spectators. Last year, however, Saudi Arabia were supported by many female fans at the men\u2019s World Cup in Qatar and the first nationwide league for women in Saudi Arabia was established in 2020.  Saudi hosted and won a four-team tournament this month, which earned the women\u2019s national team their first placing on Fifa\u2019s rankings. The Women\u2019s World Cup hopes to accelerate the growth of the women\u2019s game across the world, with an expanded number of competing nations and a tournament split over two countries for the first time. Fifa announced on Monday it had relocated the opening match in the Australian leg of the tournament to the 83,500-capacity Stadium Australia because of high demand for tickets. \u201cFifa\u2019s mission is to organise the biggest and best Women\u2019s World Cup in history this year and fans, those who bring colour, passion and atmosphere to stadiums will be such an integral part of the tournament\u2019s success,\u201d said Fifa\u2019s secretary general, Fatma Samoura. \u201cWith this in mind, we have taken a decision that will enable over 100,000 fans to attend the opening match day\u201d"

                    "body": "The 2022 World Cup was supposed to herald the arrival of Qatar, already an economic powerhouse, into the international arena as a legitimate cultural and political player. But so far, the opposite has happened. In an epic backfiring, all it seems to have achieved is focusing attention on the country\u2019s abusive treatment of migrant workers and repression of LGBTQ+ people and women. Everything in Sunday\u2019s opening ceremony \u2013 which the BBC remarkably chose not to broadcast, focusing instead on all that was wrong with Qatar 2022 \u2013 felt coloured by the buildup, precipitating an overall sense of enforced joyfulness. Even the generic welcoming words from the Qatari sovereign felt pared-back and pointed. On the face of it, the frenzy around this tournament has been the rare triumph of a human rights issue \u201ccutting through\u201d to the public. There\u2019s just something about how the bid came about that put people off: it looked like money bending the world to its will, with the event being held in winter \u2013 in the middle of the European football season \u2013 and the use of cheap, exploited labour to build the facilities. Recent headlines including a World Cup ambassador describing homosexuality as a \u201cdamage in the mind\u201d and the sight of a Danish journalist being forced off air, while broadcasting in a public space, seemed to confirm all this. High-profile footballers such as the former Bayern Munich and Germany player Philipp Lahm have said they will not be attending, while the Lionesses\u2019 captain, Leah Williamson, has said she hasn\u2019t \u201cany interest\u201d in such a compromised contest. Major European cities including Barcelona and Paris are not broadcasting matches in public places, and David Beckham, an ambassador for the event, came under intense pressure to withdraw from the proceedings. But there is something counter-productive and lopsided to the protests: the focus on the actions of sporting figures, players and even viewers seems off when Qatar only managed to manoeuvre itself into this prime position by soliciting the support of powerful states that have fast-tracked its passage into polite society. It is armed to the teeth by the UK, Europe and the US, and is a joint venturer in monumental, lucrative financial and real-estate transactions on European soil. The state of Qatar is the 10th largest landowner in Britain. Since it won the right to host the World Cup, it has been granted billions of pounds of weapons sales licences, including sophisticated surveillance equipment, by Britain. There is a special relationship with London in particular, and it can be seen in the Westminster ledger of declared gifts. In the runup to the World Cup, the value of Qatar\u2019s gifts to British MPs was greater than the amount spent by all the other 15 countries whose governments made donations to British MPs combined. The Conservative MP David Mundell, the first openly gay Tory cabinet minister, accepted hospitality worth \u00a37,473 from Qatar, and then, in a parliamentary debate a few months later, in response to concern raised by another MP about LGBTQ+ rights in Qatar, said that Qatar\u2019s critics should \u201cfocus their energies on the handling of LGBT issues in professional football in the UK\u201d.  So yes, David Beckham should know better, but he is not making a massive leap into the political fringe. Qatar is not a pariah state \u2013 it exists in a global political system of western sponsors that have forged deep alliances with Gulf monarchies and extended them immunity. The country\u2019s strong foundations are in its energy wealth, with the yield of gas exported across the world, including Europe, and its soft power is undergirded by strategically investing its surplus to forge titanium geopolitical links in and with the west. And it is the strength of those links that means the buck has passed to us; and to footballers, coaches and their organising bodies, who have to take difficult questions, or make decisions about attendance, kits, what to say and what not to say. The message from governments, meanwhile, is loud and clear. \u201cWe should not politicise sport,\u201d Emmanuel Macron said last week. What he really means is that Qatar (the recipient of French arms exports 25 times higher in 2017\u201321 than in 2012\u201316) is with the big boys. How, then, to hold any effective boycott or protest, with this sort of high-profile state protection? Further weakening the hand of those now pushed to the frontline of Qatar criticism is the fact that the last Word Cup was held, with much less scrutiny, in Russia soon after the Skripal poisonings. The relative pass Russia, a country that hunts its dissidents and passed an anti-LGBTQ \u201cgay propaganda\u201d law, was given compared with the kicking Qatar is getting, makes it hard to argue that there isn\u2019t a whiff of bias alongside the indignant good intentions. There is a sort of cultural gatekeeping at play here, where European countries with longer footballing heritages are seen as more legitimate than gauche Gulf upstarts with little historical connection to the sport. Not reckoning with past mistakes allows Qatar to position itself as a symbol of worldly progress, and hands the opportunity to cynics such as the Fifa president, Gianni Infantino, to claim that the country is being \u201cbullied\u201d.  There is also the vexing question of what constitutes a human rights violation so grave that it deserves a boycott. Is it, shall we say, running a large offshore prison that exists in a legal vacuum, where over the past 20 years, hundreds of prisoners have been dumped without a trial, and many tortured? Guant\u00e1namo Bay is not the same as systemically maltreating thousands of migrant workers \u2013 no two human rights abuses are the same. But these kind of differences are not always a matter of objective measurement, but of how successfully we have been sold narratives that inure us to some violations and sensitise us to others. How useful, then, is it really to set up moral purity tests for ourselves when our efforts are compromised by own our governments and our own unexamined prejudices and double standards? Whether you or I tune in over the next few weeks is neither here nor there. If the point is to register an objection and make a stand, then I suppose a boycott is the way to do it. But if the purpose is for some real pressure points to be squeezed so life perhaps gets better for migrant workers and LGBTQ+ people and women in Qatar, then our eyes and efforts would be better trained closer to home. Qatar and other wealthy undemocratic regimes around the world are empowered in Britain, and by extension on the global stage, by a parliamentary system open to lobbying, a lucrative weapons industry, and a real-estate economy that is geared to a global wealthy elite. Qatar may have underestimated the scrutiny that it would come under in the runup to the competition, but there is one calculation that it has surely made correctly: the anger will dissipate and attention will move on, as the football drowns out the noise. The World Cup lasts a month; grubby political alliances are for ever.  Nesrine Malik is a Guardian columnist Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The French Football Federation said in a statement that the Real Madrid forward was forced to cut short training after feeling \u201cpain in the quadriceps of his left thigh\u201d. An MRI scan later confirmed a rectus femoris tendon injury, which means the 34-year-old faces a three-week recovery period. Didier Deschamps, the France coach, said: \u201cI am extremely sad for Karim who made this World Cup a major goal. Despite this new blow for the French team, I have full confidence in my group. We will do everything to meet the huge challenge that awaits us.\u201d The injury-hit World Cup holders, already without Paul Pogba and N\u2019Golo Kant\u00e9, begin their defence against Australia on Tuesday. Deschamps has until Monday to call up a replacement for Benzema, with the Monaco striker Wissam Ben Yedder one option.  Benzema had hardly played at all in recent weeks and this was his first full training session with Les Bleus. Since winning the Ballon d\u2019Or last month he has played fewer than 30 minutes for Madrid. He was France\u2019s top scorer at the 2014 World Cup but did not play in the victorious 2018 World Cup campaign because he was still exiled from the team for his involvement in a sex tape extortion scandal that shocked French sport. He returned for last year\u2019s European Championship, and finished as France\u2019s top scorer. Deschamps has seen his squad riddled with injuries. Forward Christopher Nkunku was injured just minutes before the end of the team\u2019s last training session on Tuesday evening and replaced in the squad by Randal Kolo Muani. The coach also has an anxious wait to see if his best central defender, Rapha\u00ebl Varane, is fit to face Australia, exactly a month since he limped off for Manchester United with a hamstring injury. Fellow World Cup winner and central defender Presnel Kimpembe pulled out on Monday after failing to prove his fitness following a hamstring injury."

                    "body": "Iranian security forces on Thursday arrested one of the country\u2019s most famous footballers, accusing him of spreading propaganda against the Islamic republic and seeking to undermine the national World Cup team. Voria Ghafouri, a former member of the national football team and once a captain of the Tehran club Esteghlal, has been outspoken in his defence of Iranian Kurds, telling the government on social media to stop killing Kurdish people. He has previously been detained for criticising the former Iranian foreign minister Javad Zarif. Iran are due to play Wales on Friday. The Iranian team has already been embroiled in controversy after failing to sing the national anthem before its game against England, and Ghafouri\u2019s arrest is likely to be seen as a warning to the players not to repeat their protests. He was detained after a training session with his club, Foolad Khuzestan, on charges of having \u201ctarnished the reputation of the national team and spread propaganda against the state\u201d, the Fars new agency said. Other agencies said he was being charged with \u201cinsulting and intending to destroy the national football team and speaking against the regime\u201d. Ministers in recent days have accused Ghafouri of being a Kurdish separatist, but he replied that he would give his life for Iran. Earlier this year, the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, said: \u201cSome people, who benefit from the country\u2019s peace and security, enjoying their jobs and their favourite sports, bite the hand that feeds them,\u201d a reference many thought was to Ghafouri. The footballer, 35, was a member of Iran\u2019s 2018 World Cup squad, but was surprisingly not named in the final lineup for this year\u2019s World Cup in Qatar. Originally from the Kurdish-populated city of Sanandaj in western Iran, Ghafouri had posted a photo on Instagram of himself in traditional Kurdish dress in the mountains of Kurdistan, but is a cult hero beyond Iran\u2019s north-west. Sanandaj endured some of the most violent crackdowns in the protests that followed the death in custody of Mahsa Amini, a 22-year-old Iranian Kurd, and Ghafouri had visited some of those injured in the protests in Mahabad. In 2019, he distributed blue jerseys in honour of Sahar Khodayari, a woman who self-immolated after being sentenced to prison for attempting to watch an Esteghlal match at Azadi stadium. After another incident of violence against female football fans in 2021, Ghafouri wrote on Instagram: \u201cAs a soccer player, I\u2019ve indeed become humiliated when I play in an era when our mothers and sisters are prohibited from entering stadiums.\u201d Many fans suggested his career at Esteghlal, a championship winning team, was cut short in June as punishment for speaking out. Others argued that in his mid-30s, Ghafouri was too old for the Iranian top flight. He recently tweeted: \u201cStop killing Kurdish people!!! Kurds are Iran itself \u2026 Killing Kurds is equal to killing Iran. If you are indifferent to the killing of people, you are not an Iranian and you are not even a human being \u2026 All tribes are from Iran. Do not kill people!!!\u201d"

Beaten by the little genius before \u00c1lvarez\u2019s second goal. 5 Borna Sosa (LB) Produced disappointing deliveries from some promising positions. Uncomfortable when Messi moved over to his side. Replaced at half-time. 5 Marcelo Brozovic (CM) Poor on the second goal. Slow to the loose ball and left his defence exposed when Messi found \u00c1lvarez. 5 Luka Modric (CM) Dominated midfield at first, producing one delightful nutmeg. But he lost the ball when Argentina broke for the penalty. 6 Mateo Kovacic (CM) His driving runs had Argentina worried at 0-0. Unfortunately he lacks ideas when he reaches the final third. 6 Mario Pasalic (RW) Failed to assert himself against Tagliafico, who won their duel. He could not complain about being taken off during the interval. 4 Andrej Kramaric (CF) Croatia had nothing up front.

                    "body": "Alexi Lalas succinctly described the setting surrounding the US national team\u2019s first camp since the World Cup in Qatar. \u201cJanuary camps are always kind of strange,\u201d the player turned broadcaster told Sirius XM satellite radio, \u201cbut this is even more so because of the circumstances.\u201d In the midst of those circumstances, a young squad without the vast majority of its World Cup representatives lost its first match since returning from Qatar. An inexperienced Serbia side rallied for a 2-1 victory in a friendly Wednesday night in front of 11,475 spectators at BMO Stadium, the former Banc of California Stadium. The circumstances involve the World Cup team\u2019s coach, a talented young player, their respective families, physical abuse, possible blackmail and an ongoing investigation. Taken together, all those factors could play a pivotal role in determining the squad\u2019s future.  As a refresher: Gregg Berhalter, who guided the Americans in Qatar, told Gio Reyna, Borussia Dortmund\u2019s 20-year-old midfielder, that he would have a minimal role during the tournament. Reyna\u2019s parents, Claudio and Danielle, represented the United States internationally, with Claudio playing in three World Cups and for first-division clubs in England, Scotland and Germany. Both families had been close. The husbands were high-school and World Cup teammates, and the wives were college roommates. But during the World Cup, Berhalter received a message from someone who claimed to have information that would \u201ctake me down,\u201d he said. After the World Cup, Berhalter spoke 6 December at a leadership conference and described how he and the squad disciplined a player for poor effort in training. Though Berhalter mentioned no names, Gio Reyna was that player. Five days later, Danielle Reyna called US Soccer, the national federation, to disclose that Berhalter kicked his future wife in the legs outside a bar in 1991, when Berhalter was a freshman at North Carolina. US Soccer is now investigating Berhalter, who admitted the incident and whose contract expired after the World Cup. Gio Reyna propelled the controversy Sunday with a goal celebration that seemed to be directed at his parents, or US Soccer, or Berhalter \u2026 or all three. (He came off the bench to score another stoppage-time winner for Dortmund on Wednesday.) Into this morass stepped Anthony Hudson, one of Berhalter\u2019s assistants. The son of former Stoke City, Chelsea and England midfielder Alan Hudson became the acting manager for this week\u2019s friendlies against Serbia and Colombia.\u201cReally, there\u2019s no coaching course or anything to guide you in moments like this,\u201d said Hudson, who managed New Zealand\u2019s and Bahrain\u2019s national teams before joining Berhalter. \u201cThis is a really different situation.\u201d Complicating the situation is Hudson\u2019s relationship with Berhalter. \u201cListen, I\u2019m close with Gregg,\u201d Hudson said. \u201cIt\u2019s not been easy for me. We\u2019ve been involved in scouting. We did a lot of projects during that time. I have a lot of respect for Gregg. I have a lot to be grateful for to Gregg for giving me the opportunity. He\u2019s still a good man.\u201d Hudson\u2019s friendship with Berhalter accentuates the anguish permeating the squad. \u201cI think we all share the same sadness,\u201d Hudson said. \u201cEveryone is affected by it. You know, this is a real shame because so much good work was done. It\u2019s a shame for everyone who is involved: players, staff, Gregg. It\u2019s not a nice situation. When all this happened, all the attention has gone away from all the good work and has been shifted in another direction.\u201d But in preparing for a camp without most of those World Cup veterans, Hudson had to redirect focus. The roster composition intensified the challenge: 13 members never played in a senior international match, and six were 20 or younger.  The squad, however, included five players from the World Cup team: defenders Walker Zimmerman and Aaron Long, midfielder Kellyn Acosta, forward Jesus Ferreira and goalkeeper Sean Johnson. Another veteran, forward Paul Arriola, joined them. \u201cWhen they came in, we had a meeting with the leadership group.\u201d Hudson said. \u201cI shared my personal view of the situation a little bit. I tried to be very honest. We talked about what the camp would look like. Then I said, \u2018I\u2019m going to lean on you even more in this camp. We\u2019ve got a younger squad and we rely on you to keep the standards high, help the younger players, help the culture of the team, help teach some of the guys some of the little nuances of how we play.\u2019\u201d The result?\u201cThe vibe in the locker room is great,\u201d forward Brandon Vasquez said. \u201cEverybody gets along really well. Every time we step on the field, you can see that. The team chemistry is really there even though we have a lot of new faces. Everybody watching the US national team knows exactly their style of play and we\u2019re stepping in and doing exactly that.\u201d \u201cI think the vibes, the atmosphere, the energy of the group has been amazing, like it\u2019s not even a thing,\u201d added Eintracht Frankfurt midfielder Paxten Aaronson. \u201cA lot of it goes to the core guys, the guys who have been experienced here, like Walker, Aaron, Paul. They\u2019ve done a great job of keeping the standards set high and telling the new guys what you have to hit, what you have to achieve.\u201d Hudson expressed no surprise. \u201cThat\u2019s why we chose them to come in,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause we know the character of these guys.\u201d In Serbia, the United States faced an opponent with only three players who competed for the national team, with the most experienced making only two appearances. None of the 18 played in the World Cup.The United States took a 1-0 lead in the 29th minute on Vazquez\u2019s glancing nine-yard header off Julian Gressel\u2019s right-wing cross. But Serbia\u2019s Luca Ilic converted a 21-yard free kick in the 43rd minute, then in the 46th minute Veljko Simic scored from 13 yards after receiving a ball from Nikola Stulic, who dispossessed the Americans\u2019 Jalen Neal. \u201cI\u2019m disappointed with the result, obviously, but I was really pleased with the performance,\u201d Hudson said. \u201cWe created a lot of good chances. Individually, there were some really, really big performances. When we got a goal behind. I thought we showed a lot of bravery. I loved the fact that players were really driving to get forward and attack the backline.\u201d The United States will end this month\u2019s camp Saturday with its friendly against Colombia in nearby Carson. Beyond that ... \u201cUltimately, it\u2019s out of our hands,\u201d midfielder Paxton Pomykal said, \u201cand there\u2019s nothing we can really say about it.\u201d Hudson expressed the same sentiment with a bit of personal eloquence. \u201cWe play these two games,\u201d he said. \u201cThen, I\u2019m going to go home and see my dogs and see what comes after that.\u201d"

                    "body": "Welcome to Moving the Goalposts, the Guardian\u2019s free women\u2019s football newsletter. Here\u2019s an extract from this week\u2019s edition. To receive the full version once a week, just pop your email in below:  Welcome, 2023. Women\u2019s football fans, this is our time to count the seconds until New Zealand v Norway kicks off the World Cup on 20 July. Expectations are high for the tournament and there is an expectation it will increase interest in the women\u2019s game in Australia and New Zealand, the host countries that will be the centre of the football world for a month. \u201cI dream of a cultural shift from the World Cup,\u201d says Moya Dodd, chair of Common Goal, and a former Matildas vice-captain who was a member of the Fifa Council until 2017. \u201c[I hope] that women can enjoy gender equality in sports and all roles in society, that football is fully embraced as a truly Australian sport and that football becomes a holistic and inclusive game where everybody belongs.\u201d  Legacy plans for the host nations discuss the importance of achieving gender parity in football, supporting future generations of girls who want to play. Dodd says that although she is excited to see the game growing, it is bittersweet to think that for decades women were banned and shunned. \u201cWhy couldn\u2019t our mothers have been professionals or at least players?\u201d she says. \u201cWhy couldn\u2019t I grow up seeing women\u2019s football in the media?\u201d She hopes Australia hosting the World Cup will lead more people in her country to realise the importance of \u2013 and potential for \u2013 the growth of the women\u2019s game and be reflected in participation numbers. \u201c2023 is a once-in-a-generation chance to make up a lot of ground,\u201d she says. \u201cWe have to seize the moment.\u201d  Dodd also highlights the importance of promoting the A-League Women, Australian\u2019s top division. Wellington Phoenix, a New Zealand professional team, are one of 11 clubs in the competition. \u201cJust as the Euros gave a lift to the WSL, I want to see the World Cup deliver new audiences to the league here in Australia and to all pro leagues around the world. \u201cThese competitions create jobs for women in the game, show week in, week out entertainment to fans and elevate role models for aspiring players. The leagues and the national team competitions uplift each other.\u201d  For fans travelling to Australia for the World Cup there are many opportunities for sightseeing \u2013 Dodd particularly recommends the central market and Rundle Street in her home town Adelaide and Sydney Harbour Bridge. She also identifies the opportunity to learn how to speak Australian \u2013 \u201ceven if you\u2019re flat-out like a lizard drinking\u201d (for non-Australians it means \u201ceven if you\u2019re extremely busy\u201d). Dodd says the World Cup is also a chance for visitors and tourists to understand Australia\u2019s culture. \u201cI hope they can appreciate that Australia is home to the oldest continuous civilisation in the world. They have been custodians of this land for 65,000 years.\u201d  She also points out the importance of traditions such as Welcome to Country, a ceremony performed by a traditional owner or custodian to welcome visitors to their ancestral land, usually at the beginning of an event. \u201cTake time to understand and appreciate it,\u201d Dodd says. Both World Cup legacy plans aim to support the inclusion of Indigenous girls and women in football. M\u0101ori and Indigenous Australians will have opportunities and programmes developed for these communities. Football Australia\u2019s participation pillar seeks to introduce a national Indigenous programme and New Zealand Football aims to have more M\u0101ori making meaningful connections throughout the game. \u201cThe Matildas are a hugely popular team and their presence is very tangible,\u201d Dodd says. \u201cMy only wish is that each Matilda be the best she is capable of, so that the team collectively can be at its best. Nothing could be better than that and nobody could ask for more.\u201d Talking point It was 1991. The first Women\u2019s World Cup took place in China and, in the stands, the greatest men\u2019s footballer of all time was impressed by what the players were doing on the pitch. \u201cNo one should be ashamed to give a football to a girl,\u201d said Pel\u00e9. During the Tokyo Olympics, 30 years later, he congratulated Marta when she became the first woman to score in five consecutive Games. \u201cHow many dreams do you think you inspired today?\u201d he wrote. After Pel\u00e9\u2019s death last Thursday, it feels important to remember him and his influence on the game. As Marta said: \u201cThrough your feet, we were and will be blessed by your art.\u201d Rest in peace, Pel\u00e9.  Quote of the week \u201cYou get to a certain age when you actually say: \u2018This is a really big fucking problem.\u2019 I\u2019m pretty sure if men had periods we would have figured out a way to stop them by now without doing any damage\u201d \u2013 Leah Williamson on living with endometriosis in Women\u2019s Health.

                    "body": "Gio Reyna admitted on Monday that he sulked after being told he would have a limited role at the World Cup. I know, I know. This is what passes for scandal in Gregg Berhalter\u2019s America. Come back to me if your players butt or bite an opponent, get kicked out of the tournament for drugs, arrested for theft or indulge in a naked pool party. As player-coach spats go, it\u2019s not in the same league as the feu d\u2019artifice that saw France\u2019s Nicolas Anelka sent home during the 2010 tournament amid internal fissures so deep that the 2006 finalists finished bottom of their group. It\u2019s not even as significant as the incident that led to Weston McKennie being sent home for violating squad protocols in Nashville last year, given the midfielder\u2019s value to the team and the negative effects that would have dogged the rest of the qualifying campaign if the incident had bred lingering rancor.  But now we have an explanation for why Jordan Morris rather than Reyna came off the bench in the 1-1 draw with Wales, and support for Guardian columnist and former US forward Eric Wynalda\u2019s claim ahead of the Iran match that there was a \u201crift\u201d between coach and player.  For why Berhalter talked about being cautious with Reyna because of \u201ca little bit of tightness\u201d in training, only for the player to assert that he felt \u201cgreat\u201d. For the slightly weird vibes, the vague sense of the uncanny around the Berhalter-Reyna dynamic in Qatar in what otherwise appeared to be a harmonious and happy camp. Berhalter\u2019s collection of T-shirts and limited-edition sneakers were more eye-catching than the 20-year-old Borussia Dortmund playmaker. But it\u2019s strange that Reyna was so shocked and offended to be a member of the supporting cast. It would have been irrational to make him a foundation of the team given his frequent muscle injuries, including the tightness that saw him exit the US\u2019s final pre-tournament friendly against Saudi Arabia after 30 minutes. He featured only four times during Concacaf World Cup qualifying, starting just once, in the opener against El Salvador in September last year. (He got injured.) It would have been extraordinary for Berhalter to reshape his tactics and lineup in Qatar to integrate Reyna as a key player.  Maybe the team\u2019s tepid performances and lack of attacking threat in the run-up to the tournament might have convinced some coaches to deal their wild card. But Berhalter opted against picking his maverick and went with the more conservative choices, the surer things, perspiration above inspiration. And that was understandable given what figured to be a hard grind against more experienced opponents. Starting Reyna would have felt like hiring a ballet dancer for a factory shift. No one doubts his potential, but at this point in his international career he\u2019s a nice bonus, an optional extra. If the US team were a car, Tyler Adams would be the engine, Christian Pulisic would be the accelerator and Reyna would be a fancy touchscreen. He didn\u2019t, and doesn\u2019t, have the leverage to step out of line and expect to get away with it. Besides, the midfield trio of McKennie, Adams and Yunus Musah and the wingers Christian Pulisic and Tim Weah fully justified their places in the starting XI, weakening Reyna\u2019s case even more. And the industrious and in-form Brenden Aaronson, who made four substitute appearances, deserved to be ahead of Reyna in the queue. Perhaps Berhalter could have moved Weah to a central position to make room for Reyna on the right wing, which may have helped solve the lack of production at striker. But given Weah\u2019s effectiveness on the flank, it\u2019s not necessarily fair to second-guess the coach in this respect. The 2026 World Cup is too distant and Reyna\u2019s simply not enough of a star \u2013 yet \u2013 to justify hyperbolic columns attempting to set up a showdown scenario in which this team ain\u2019t big enough for the both of them and it\u2019s Berhalter who\u2019s chased out. Especially when Reyna was so obviously in the wrong. A player\u2019s unprofessionalism \u2013 a lack of effort at the World Cup, of all places \u2013 is somehow the coach\u2019s fault? Who does Reyna think he is? Cristiano Ronaldo? There is, admittedly, an irony to savor in Berhalter\u2019s leadership skills being questioned as a result of comments he made as a guest expert at a summit on leadership skills. It was naive to expect that newsworthy remarks in front of an audience would not become public. (Unless Berhalter has made up his mind to resign and so feels relaxed about speaking freely.) There\u2019s a different level of scrutiny and interest in this US team, in a much-altered media environment compared to 1998, when Steve Sampson dropped John Harkes from the squad two months before the tournament in France for \u201cconduct issues\u201d but it took 12 years for the full story to emerge. However, from Berhalter\u2019s point of view the episode was a successful piece of man-management: he mentioned it as an example of tackling a difficult decision head-on. He, his staff and squad members addressed a conduct problem, resolved it and moved forward. Clearly it was serious, since Reyna was at risk of being sent home. Yet it did not become public until after the tournament, averting potentially destabilising scrutiny from media and fans when it really might have mattered. Notably, despite the irritation at the leaks that Reyna conveys in his statement, Berhalter did not publicly call out the winger in Qatar despite having ample opportunities to do so, nor did he name him during the summit interview; MLSSoccer.com and The Athletic broke the news. Reyna made two appearances in Qatar: as an 83rd-minute substitute in the goalless draw with England and then coming on at half-time in the 3-1 round of sixteen loss to the Netherlands. He made scant impact during his sole extended opportunity in a match that saw the Americans knocked out because they committed individual defensive errors against clinical opponents. The idea that Reyna\u2019s presence from the first whistle might have made all the difference as the US sought a quarter-final berth is highly dubious. Evidence-based arguments, though, are not the point. Reyna isn\u2019t yet an integral part of the team but he\u2019s one of its most potent symbols: an avatar of the US\u2019s young talent and bright future, and a useful tool here and now for Berhalter\u2019s legion of critics."

Danni Wyatt is back in the zone, Katherine Sciver-Brunt has refound her mo-jo, Nat Sciver-Brunt is flying. But perhaps the last word should go to Nasser Hussain, who speaks words of warning, and wisdom. The big three \u2013 India, Australia and England \u2013 are dominating women\u2019s cricket much as they are dominating the men\u2019s game. \u201cThis is a World Cup,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to make sure the haves and the have-nots can play together.\u201d  Updated at 4.36pm GMT    4.21pm    A hugely impressive win for England, who move smoothly into the semi-finals either against South Africa or New Zealand [to be decided in the South Africa v Bangladesh game which starts in half an hour). The emphatic win leaves India to take on Australia in the other semi-final.       4.18pm    Captain chat: Nida Dar: \u201cIt was not the result we wanted. We know we are lacking strength in our batting line up and we have to learn from these type of matches and we\u2019ve taken some positive from the matches. Wev\u2019e played two very good matches\u2026I think time for the new girls to come forward and take the challenge and move forward.\u201d Heather Knight: \u201cWe talked about trying to take some momentum into the semis .. really top day. Really pleased with Danni, the way she\u2019d been batting in the nets wasn\u2019t too far away from a score like that. She was really disappointed when she got out which is nice to see as a captain. Bit more pace and carry than we\u2019re used to [at Newlands], Kathering used that brilliantly, bit of turn for the leg spinners too, good to get used to it.\u201d     4.11pm   Nat Sciver-Brunt is the player of the match!  The most expensive overseas player in the WPL proves her worth with a stunning innings and a wicket too:  \u201cTheir spinners bowled a little slower than ours. We thought the wicket was pretty good. The start from Wyatt was so important, Sophia and Alice have been batting so well so far, and it\u2019s so crucial. We\u2019d been building well into this tournament, we hadn\u2019t been bowling that well. This was a really good performance.\u201d     4.08pm   England beat Pakistan by 114 runs  20th over: Pakistan 99-9 (Fatima 16) Four byes slip past Amy Jones as both she and Fatima let the ball pass them by. Pakistan knock Ecclestone for three singles before the last wicket. Happy England, glum Pakistan, but handshakes all round.     4.05pm   WICKET!  Nashra Sandhu st Jones b Ecclestone 1 (Pakistan 99-9)  A wicket from the final ball in what is the biggest win in a women\u2019s T20 World Cup \u2013 by a whopping 114 runs. Sandhu misses Ecclestone\u2019s final ball and Jones makes no mistake with the gloves.     4.02pm    19th over: Pakistan 97-8 (Fatima 14) Freya Davies bowls the penultimate over and send downs a slow full toss which Tuba slaps to the rope. Emboldened, she then shovels the ball high and into the hands of KSB who catches the ball over over the boundary. Alas, the scrambled egg run out follows.     4.01pm   WICKET! Tuba run out (Capsey-Davies) 28 (Pakistan 91-8)   A horlicks of a run-out spoils Tuba\u2019s cameo after she jogs a run half-heartedly thinking the ball has crossed the rope, ambles back and even as she sees the ball being returned moves in slow motion and is out by a stride      3.54pm    18th over: Pakistan 80-7 (Fatima 13, Tuba 17) A one-handed slap by Fatima off collar-bone high full toss from Ecclestone, and a no-ball is called. The shadows sweep around the boundary edges. Two overs left, 134 needed.      3.50pm    17th over: Pakistan 77-7 (Fatima 12, Tuba 16) Davies, jaunty pony tail, bounces in. Nearly another run-out as Tuba goes for a quick single before changing her mind. Wyatt\u2019s somewhat lugubrious throw doesn\u2019t beat the diving batter \u2013 though the third umpire takes their time on the decision.      3.47pm    15th over: Pakistan 74-7 (Fatima 10, Tuba 15) Tuba tucks into a full toss from Dean and shimmies it through the covers for four. Fatima loses her feet to manoeuvre the ball round the field and Tuba\u2019s dab over mi-off brings two more past Ecclestone running in slow-mo. A double figure over for Pakistan!     3.44pm    15th over: Pakistan 64-7 (Fatima 9, Tuba 6) A mixture of flight and flat-ones by Glenn, as Knight encourages her charges to stay on the job.     3.41pm    14th over: Pakistan 62-7 (Fatima 8, Tuba 5) Charlie Dean approaches with her rapid run out. Pakistan pick her off for six relatively easy runs. The camera pans to Nida Dar, sitting alone on the concrete step outside the dressing room, hand on chin.     3.38pm    13th over: Pakistan 56-7 (Fatima 7, Tuba 1 ) On the grassy banks of Newlands, the fans loll back and applaud Pakistan\u2019s fifty. Twenty-one year old Fatima off-drives KSB beautifully for four before losing her partner in a fuzzy run-out.      3.37pm   WICKET! Sidra run out (Nat Sciver-Brunt) 12 (Pakistan 54-7)  Mishap follows mix-up as Sidra Amin tries to scurry a run from the non-striker\u2019s end, rapdily rethinks \u2013 but too slowly \u2013 and NSB throws down the stumps.   Updated at 4.02pm GMT    3.33pm    12th over: Pakistan 49-6 (Fatima 2,Sidra 1 ) Ecclestone not the light relief Pakistan were hoping for \u2013 they manage a single.       3.31pm    11th over: Pakistan 48-6 (Fatima 2,Sidra 1 ) Heather Knight ringing the changes, beckons KSB back on. She drops a couple of wides into the mix before sending Aliya on her way. Not long for this tournament, a brow-beaten Pakistan.     3.29pm   WICKET! Aliya c Knight b KSB 5 (Pakistan 47-6)  Aliya launches into an off cutter, tips it into the heavens and Knight grabs on with both hands at cover. Happy captain, happy team.   Updated at 4.01pm GMT    3.24pm    10th over: Pakistan 44-4 (Aliya 5, Fatima 1) Nine from the wicket-taking over, after Aliya Riaz gets a lucky thick edge down which rattles along to the boundary.     3.21pm   WICKET! Sidra Ameen c KSB b Dean 12 (Pakistan 39-5)  Pakistan crumbling in the face of England\u2019s huge total. Sidra Ameen plays an ugly spatular shot to Katherine Sciver-Brunt who collects at long on. And we take DRINKS!   Updated at 3.37pm GMT    3.19pm    9th over: Pakistan 35-4 ( Sidra Ameen 8, Aliya 1) And England will avoid Australia in the semi-final! A match against the hosts or New Zealand \u2013 depending on the result of the match later today \u2013 awaits. Huge applause from the knowledgeable England fans.     3.16pm   WICKET! Dar st Jones b Glenn 11 (Pakistan 33-4)  The stand-in captain\u2019s miserable match gets worse when she skips down the wicket, tries to smack Glenn into the shady sheets and is neatly stumped.   Updated at 3.25pm GMT    3.13pm    8th over: Pakistan 31-3 (Nida Dar 10, Sidra Ameen 6) Ecclestone in her raspberry boots, takes the first over at the end of the power play. Pakistan aren\u2019t fazed though, picking off runs \u2013 including a reverse sweep for two.     3.11pm    7th over: Pakistan 27-3 (Nida Dar 9 , Sidra Ameen 3) No rest for Pakistan as Sarah Glenn takes her first over. The flags are limp \u2013 and the smoke from the braais rises vertically. Three singles and three dots \u2013 with Pakistan needing over 14 an over for a miracle.  Updated at 3.12pm GMT    3.07pm    6th over: Pakistan 20-3 (Nida Dar 8, Sidra Ameen 1) A quiet over for Pakistan until Dar helps Davies over fine leg for four.     3.06pm    5th over: Pakistan 19-3 (Nida Dar 4, Sidra Ameen 0) A timely/consolation boundary for Pakistan as Nida Dar dabs to the fine leg rope.     3.04pm   WICKET! Omaima Sohail c Davies b N Sciver-Brunt 9 (Pakistan 15-3)  Ooof, there goes another as Omaima eyes up the rope but can only screech it to Davies at fine leg who runs and gathers. Not a bad afternoon\u2019s work for NSB.   Updated at 3.09pm GMT    3.00pm    4th over: Pakistan 15-21 (Omaima 9) Charlie Dean gets the nod for the third over of the day \u2013 starts with a wide and finishes with a wicket.  Updated at 3.04pm GMT    2.59pm   WICKET! Muneeba c Jones b Dean 3 (Pakistan 15-2)   The century maker against Pakistan has to plod off, bat up by her ears, sweeping one that wasn\u2019t for sweeping and top edging high and into the gloves of the strolling Amy Jones.     2.55pm    3rd over: Pakistan 11-1 (Omaima 7, Muneeba 2) On the money today, KSB, zoning in at the stumps, the sun high over Table Mountain. Just a single from the over. And, in pleasing news for England fans, Pakistan would have to chase England\u2019s total down in nine overs for England to have to face Australia in the semi-finals.      2.51pm    2nd over: Pakistan 10-1 (Omaima 6, Muneeba 2) Davies\u2019 first two balls are a wide and a no-ball with her foot too wide on the return crease. A beautiful cover drive from Omaima races to the rope.       2.47pm    1st over: Pakistan 2-1 (Omaima 1, Muneeba 1) Katherine Sciver-Brunt puts the nightmare of the last game to rest with a wicket with her second ball.      2.44pm   WICKET! Sadaf Shamas c Jones b  K Sciver-Brunt 0 (Pakistan 0-1)  Not the ideal start for Pakistan, as Sadaf Shamas goes neither soft nor hard, but leaden-footed, and top edges to the keeper.   Updated at 3.06pm GMT    2.42pm   Pakistan to chase 214 to win  I take that back, no time for tea, just toast and peanut butter. Anyway, here we are, Katherine Sciver-Brunt with the ball and Pakistan ready to start their record-breaking chase\u2026     2.37pm    20th over: England 213-5 (N Sciver-Brunt 81) Wow! The highest score ever in a women\u2019s T20 World Cup. Pakistan had no answer to the power hitting and precision of England, of Wyatt and NSB in particular. A couple of boundaries from Fatima\u2019s final over \u2013 bringing up the hundred partnership between Jones and Nat Sciver-Brunt in just 46 balls. Mumbai Indians will be delighted with their costly purchase.  Time for a quick cup of tea before we restart with Pakistan chasing 214.     2.32pm   WICKET! Jones c Tuba b Fatima  (England 213-5)  Slams the last ball of the innings \u2013 a slower one \u2013 into the stratosphere and down into the hands of deep midwicket \u2013 who drops it on the first take but saves her blushes with a timely grab with her right hand.   Updated at 2.38pm GMT    2.29pm    19th over: England 202-4 (N Sciver-Brunt 76, Jones 41) Amy Jones slams Nashra Sandu for six over square leg as England pass two hundred \u2013 the first time a team has passed 200 in a Women\u2019s T20 World Cup. A possible stumping of Jones from the last ball \u2013 which the replay actually shows was out. \u201cWhat with \u2018pancaking\u2019 a shot or passing a \u2018pudding basin\u2019 fielder, we can guess what impact Shrove Tuesday is having on your screed,\u201d writes John Starbuck. \u201cAs the designated cook for today\u2019s dessert in our household I can sympathise, but really it should just look after itself if you keep it simple.\u201d I wish I had your confidence\u2026 \u201cIncidentally, I see the earlier reference to your email address still includes \u2018guardian.co.uk\u2018, but in my address box it shows up as \u2018theguardian.com\u2018. Perhaps there\u2019s a glitch in your system?\u201d Ah \u2013 yes, the guardian.com, my mistake.     2.24pm    18th over: England 192-4 (N Sciver-Brunt 75, Jones 32) Sadia can\u2019t stop the run leaks.. Three for Amy Jones, then NSB drops to the off side and sweeps four. And another sweep and another boundary. A single brings Jones to the strike and she pulls four again legside, before picking up three past backward point. And Pakistan\u2019s fielders kindly contribute by diving over the ball and slipping on banana skins.      2.19pm    17th over: England 173-4 (N Sciver-Brunt 66, Jones 22) Nida Dar rolls up for her last over and in an attempt to contain NSB. It doesn\u2019t work, as she sweep her first ball for four. Then Jones joins in, reverse-sweeping to the rope before powering another. Runs on runs \u2013 and NSB now has the largest collection in this World Cup with 161 and counting.     2.15pm   Fifty for Nat Sciver-Brunt!  16th over: England 159-4 (N Sciver-Brunt 61, Jones 13) Nat Sciver-Brunt effortless out there, reaching fifty down on one knee, and following that boundary with two more \u2013 a pull and a meaty drive over cover for six.   Updated at 2.40pm GMT    2.12pm    15th over: England 143-4 (N Sciver-Brunt 46, Jones 11) Events! Pakistan\u2019s bowlers are not being helped by their fielders out there today \u2013 Nat Sciver Brunt turns the ball to short fine leg where the fielder kneels performatively but somehow misses the ball. Jones gets hit in the guts by a full toss from Fatima which cuts her in half and is called no ball. Then \u2013 and this is so unlucky for Pakistan, the keeper whips off her gloves to take a return \u2013 and the ball hits the grounded glove. Finally, another waist-high full toss \u2013 and chat about whether Fatima should be removed from the attack. Answer: no.      2.03pm    14th over: England 125-4 (N Sciver-Brunt 41, Jones 6) A fumble on the boundary by Dar, brings Jones her first boundary.      2.02pm    13th over: England 119-4 (N Sciver-Brunt 40, Jones 1) Dar becomes the leading wicket-taker in T20s with the wicket of Knight, and nearly sweeps up a second when Jones top-edges first ball, just past a pudding basin fine leg who doesn\u2019t pick up the ball in time. Unpeturbed, Nat SB, shovels square for four.     1.57pm   WICKET! Knight c Nashra b Dar 3 (England  113-4)  A slog-sweep, but there isn\u2019t enough power on it to reach the long boundaries at Newlands. Nicely taken by Nashra who is mindful of her feet placings.      1.55pm    12th over: England 111-3 (N Sciver-Brunt 34, Knight 3) Just six off the over and a vital wicket for Pakistan as Wyatt and N Sciver-Brunt needed little oil to grease their gears in a threatening partnership.     1.52pm   WICKET! Wyatt c S Amin  b Tuba 59 (England 107-3)  Dances down the pitch, lofts the ball to long off where a be-sunglassed Amin takes the ball at chest height, peddling backwards. She\u2019s frustrated with herself but it has been a cracking knock and hopefull bedded a few daemons.     1.49pm   Fifty for Danni Wyatt!  11th over: England 105-2 (N Sciver-Brunt 34, Wyatt 57) Newlands looking a picture \u2013 a scattered crowd making a good noise, with more expected later when South Africa take on Bangladesh. Those beautiful trees \u2013 that beautiful mountain\u2026 anyway, the cricket \u2013 wham bam 16 off Nashra\u2019s over. Wyatt reaches fifty with a sweep and celebrates next ball by pancaking a full toss over square leg. It\u2019s her first fifty in a T20 World Cup.     1.44pm    10th over: England 89-2 (N Sciver-Brunt 31, Wyatt 44) The fifty partnership comes up with a beauty from Nat Sciver-Brunt, who skips, angles and thuds Tuba Hassan through the covers for four. She and Wyatt continue to gobble up singles, taking risks but falling safe.  John Starbuck, hello!  \u201cNot that I wish the Kiwis any ill-will but it would be better for the tournament if South Africa feature in the semi-final. A more engaged crowd always provides improved excitement.\u201d Always hoping for home side involvement for a long as possible in a tournament.     1.39pm    9th over: England 80-2 (N Sciver-Brunt 23, Wyatt 43) Nashra with her slinging left arm restores some sanity. On comms they were commenting on Wyatt having a point to prove. A week ago, here was her heartbroken reaction to not being picked up in the IPL.      1.36pm    8th over: England 75-2 (N Sciver-Brunt 20, Wyatt 41) Awww that\u2019s gorgeous, Sciver Brunt drives through the covers and finishes on one leg just to prove her perfect balance. If I had to place her, I\u2019d plonk her exactly in the zone. And there goes Wyatt on the sweep, stretching forward to make the most of her little frame, and picking up another four. Pakistan struggling to contain these two.  Updated at 1.37pm GMT    1.33pm    7th over: England 63-2 (N Sciver-Brunt 13, Wyatt 36) Thanks very much says N Sciver-Brunt to Nashra Sandhu, stepping past off-stump, kneeling deep to sweep, and powering the ball to the rope. A handful of singles and another hearty over for England.     1.28pm    6th over: England 55-2 (N Sciver-Brunt 7, Wyatt 34) Full length outside off and Danni Wyatt launches into the stand-in Pakistan captain with a flourishing lofted drive. A boundary for Sciver-Brunt too, 13 from Dar\u2019s first over and a hearty total, with extra roast potatoes, at the end of the power play.     1.25pm    5th over: England 42-2 (N Sciver-Brunt 1, Wyatt 27) Wyatt holding the innings together, with two banging fours from Sadia\u2019s last two balls after another wicket in the power play for Pakistan.  Updated at 1.25pm GMT    1.23pm   WICKET! Capsey b Sadia Iqbal 6 (England 33-2)  Capsey plumps for a sweep but misses \u2013 and looks as fed up as her now disjointed off stump.   Updated at 1.40pm GMT    1.21pm    4th over: England 33-1 (Capsey 6, Wyatt 19) Fatima, black headband slipping down her forehead, skids into Wyatt who is squinting under the brim of her helmet. She steers the ball behind her boots and down to backward point for four \u2013 very nicely done. That\u2019s 12 off the over after a thudding four from Capsey.     1.16pm    3rd over: England 21-1 (Capsey 1, Wyatt 12) The tall Sadia troubles Capsey, who nearly gets a leading edge and then lobs just short of long on. A quick single to switch the strike \u2013 but just three from it.  You aren\u2019t the only one to be asking this question Duncan Mcminn. Lauren Bell has officially been rested \u2013 perhaps for the semi \u2013 and I assume Knight just believes in and wants Brunt\u2019s experience \u2013 she\u2019s pulled England out of so many holes in the past.     1.11pm    2nd over: England 18-1 (Capsey 0, Wyatt 10) Fatima opens with a boomeranging ball that flies past the diving keeper and down to the rope. A no ball follows \u2013 and a free hit which reaches mid-off for no run. Dar doesn\u2019t look that impressed but is soon smiling when Dunkley dobs straight to the fielder.     1.10pm   WICKET! Dunkley c Nashra  b Fatima 2 (England 18-1)   Dunkley leans back, looks unbalanced, and thuds the ball straight to mid on. After a troubled over, Fatima leaps in delight.     1.04pm    1st over: England 10-0 (Dunkley 0, Wyatt 10) After a wait for the clock to tick round, Sadia Iqbal opens the bowling with her gentle looking left arm spin. Wyatt watches the first three obediently before driving the fourth through point for four and lumping the fifth for six.     12.58pm    Our Raf is perturbed:      12.57pm    Do send me your thoughts, idle or otherwise, either via twitter: @tjaldred or email me on tanya.aldred.freelance@guardian.co.uk.     12.55pm    The teams march out, under perfect bluebell skies, holding hands with the mascots. Now for the anthems: Pakistan sing along with hands on their hearts and suncream on their faces. England, arms over each others shoulders, sunglasses free, belt along to an operatic version of God Save the King.     12.47pm    All roads lead to Australia, but the aim is to put that off as long as possible. If England beat Pakistan, they will avoid the Aussies in the semis and play either South Africa or New Zealand depending on if South Africa beat Bangladesh later.      12.42pm   Pakistan XI  Sadaf Shamas, Muneeba Ali Siddiqui, Omaima Sohail, Nida Dar (c), Aliya Riaz, Sidra Amin, Fatima Sana Khan, Sidra Nawaz (wk), Nashra Sandhu, Tuba Hassan, Sadia Iqbal.     12.41pm   England XI   Danni Wyatt, Sophia Dunkley, Alice Capsey, Nat Sciver-Brunt, Heather Knight (c), Amy Jones (wk), Katherine Sciver-Brunt, Sophie Ecclestone, Sarah Glenn, Charlie Dean, Freya Davies.     12.40pm    Nida Dar, in her first outing as Pakistan captain, and with an impressively elaborate sweeping hairstyle, speaks to Nasser Hussain. Two changes for Pakistan: Bismah Mahroof and Aamin Anwer miss out replaced by Sadaf Shamas and Sidra Nawaz.     12.35pm   England win the toss and will bat!  Knight calls heads and chooses to bat on a lovely looking pitch. There is one change from the last game \u2013 but it isn\u2019t Brunt who sits out but Lauren Bell. Davies replaces her.     12.31pm    News from the ground is that Freya Davies is warming up \u2013 perhaps no room for Brunt today after that tricky time in the last game.      12.27pm     All change at the top for Pakistan, after captain Bismah Mahroof sits out after picking up a strain during the game against West Indies last week. Nida Dar wears the captain\u2019s armband today.     12.23pm   Preamble  Good morning! Here we are already at match 19 in a competition that is speeding on into the knock-out stages, as England take on Pakistan. Favourites Australia have already topped Group A, winning all of their games. Hot on their tails England qualified for the semi-finals when Pakistan lost to West Indies, with India claiming second spot in the group after beating Ireland. England will finish top of Group B unless they are thrashed by Pakistan today at a cloudless Newlands \u2013 unlikely, as England have won 13 of the last 14 ODIs between the two sides. England\u2019s nine-match winning streak \u2013 topped off by an 11-run victory over India last Saturday - has been done with much elbow grease from Sophie Ecclestone and Sarah Glenn in particular ,and a decent hand from the batters. Pakistan are looking for a second consolation victory before they head home. The action starts at 1pm GMT.   Updated at 12.28pm GMT "

                    "body": "USA midfielder Gio Reyna has responded to reports that he was almost sent home from Qatar for a perceived lack of effort during the team\u2019s preparations for their World Cup opener against Wales. The Athletic reported that Reyna was \u201cwalking around\u201d while the rest of the team trained intensely in one session a few days before the Wales match, USA\u2019s first game at a World Cup since 2014. It was not clear whether the 20-year-old\u2019s performance was due to injury or disappointment that he was unlikely to start against Wales. The Athletic said senior US players spoke to Reyna about the situation several times before he eventually apologized to his teammates, and the matter was considered to be settled. Reyna himself appeared to corroborate some aspects of the story in an Instagram post on Monday, while calling parts of the coverage \u201chighly fictionalized versions of events\u201d.  \u201cJust before the World Cup [USA coach Gregg] Berhalter told me that my role at the tournament would be very limited,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI was devastated. I am someone who plays with pride and passion. Soccer is my life, and I believe in my abilities \u2026 I am also a very emotional person, and I fully acknowledge that I let my emotions get the best of me and affect my training and behavior for a few days after learning about my limited role. I apologized to my teammates and coach for this, and I was told I was forgiven. Thereafter, I shook off my disappointment and gave everything I had on and off the field.\u201d Berhalter was criticized by some fans for not starting the Wales match with Reyna, who has impressed during his time with Borussia Dortmund. At the time, Berhalter said Reyna was suffering from \u201ca little bit of tightness\u201d.  Reyna, however, told the media after the Wales match that: \u201cI feel really good. I feel great. I feel fine. [Berhalter] doesn\u2019t have to tell me why he didn\u2019t put me in or why he does.\u201d ESPN reports that teammates and coaches spoke to Reyna after those comments and he issued his apology shortly afterwards. Last week, Berhalter appeared to be talking about Reyna in a speech to the HOW Institute for Society\u2019s Summit on Moral Leadership in New York. \u201c[We] had a player [in Qatar] that was clearly not meeting expectations on and off the field. One of 26 players, so it stood out. As a staff, we sat together for hours deliberating what we were going to do with this player. We were ready to book a plane ticket home, that\u2019s how extreme it was,\u201d Berhalter said. He added that the player subsequently apologized and \u201creally took ownership of that process. And from that day on there were no issues with this player.\u201d Berhalter told ESPN that last week\u2019s speech was supposed to be off the record and he did not wish to identify the player in question. \u201cIt\u2019s not really important who it was,\u201d Berhalter told ESPN on Sunday. \u201cThe important thing is that the group had very clear standards and they were prepared to communicate if the standards weren\u2019t being met. Sometimes that communication leads to positive change and a clear pathway forward.\u201d Reyna\u2019s agent, Dan Segal, issued a statement to The Athletic on Sunday. \u201cGio obviously did not have the experience anyone hoped for at the World Cup. The situation, relationships and interactions among parties are far more complicated than what has been reported. It is disappointing and disrespectful for certain parties to be commenting on private team matters publicly, especially when some do so without full knowledge of the facts and others do so in a self-serving manner,\u201d he said in the statement. Reyna appeared to reference Berhalter\u2019s speech in Monday\u2019s Instagram post. \u201cI am disappointed that there is continuing coverage of this matter \u2026 and extremely surprised that anyone on the US men\u2019s team staff would contribute to it,\u201d he wrote. \u201cCoach Berhalter has always said that issues that arise with the team will stay \u2018in house\u2019 so we can focus on team unity and progress \u2026 I hope that going forward each person involved in US Soccer focuses on what is in the best interest of the men\u2019s national team so we can enjoy great success at the World Cup in 2026.\u201d Reyna came on a substitute for seven minutes in the draw with England and for the second-half in USA\u2019s last-16 defeat to the Netherlands. He played no part in their final group match, against Iran."
