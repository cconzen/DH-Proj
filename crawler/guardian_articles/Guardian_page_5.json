                    "body": "Some of Brazil\u2019s best-known footballers have faced a furious backlash as fans and pundits questioned why they had failed to attend ceremonies bidding farewell to Pel\u00e9.\n\nHundreds of thousands of people waited for hours under a burning sun on Monday to file past the recently deceased soccer legend\u2019s coffin at Santos\u2019 Vila Belmiro ground.\nBut only a handful of Brazil\u2019s World Cup winners made the trip 50 miles down the coast from S\u00e3o Paulo to pay homage, with Ricardo Kak\u00e1, Neymar da Silva Santos J\u00fanior and Ronaldo Nazario among those singled out for criticism.\n\u201cPel\u00e9 is a citizen of the world, at the same level as Nelson Mandela or Mahatma Gandhi, but Brazilians don\u2019t know how to recognise that,\u201d said Jos\u00e9 Ferreira Neto, once a former Brazil midfielder and now one of Brazil\u2019s most outspoken TV presenters.\n\u201cIf they were World Cup winners and didn\u2019t come to see Pel\u00e9, what can I say to them? At the very least it shows a lack of respect.\u201d\nNeto, who played for Santos\u2019 archrivals Corinthians, appeared early on Tuesday morning at the 24-hour wake and was preceded by a host of dignitaries, including FIFA president Gianni Infantino; Alejandro Dom\u00ednguez, head of the South American Football Confederation CONMEBOL; and S\u00e3o Paulo governor Tarc\u00edsio de Freitas.\nLuiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva also flew in from Brasilia less than 48 hours after being inaugurated for a third term as president.\n\nMany of Pel\u00e9\u2019s teammates in the all-conquering Santos teams of the 1960s have died and others are well into their 80s and in poor health.\nHowever, several of those who played alongside him were there, including Clodoaldo Tavares de Santana, who was the only one of the legendary 1970 Brazil team to appear. Tost\u00e3o (Eduardo Gon\u00e7alves de Andrade), Jairzinho (Jair Ventura Filho), Roberto Rivellino, G\u00e9rson de Oliveira Nunes and Wilson Piazza were all conspicuous by their absence.\nNone of those who played in the Brazil team that won their fifth and most recent World Cup title in 2002 were present and only one of the victorious 1994 side turned up, Mauro Silva, who is now vice-president of the S\u00e3o Paulo football federation.\nOne of the most controversial absences was Kak\u00e1.\nThe FIFA World Player of the Year in 2007 said in December that Brazilians did not show enough respect for their national heroes, citing regular criticism of Neymar and Ronaldo.\nKak\u00e1 did not appear in Santos and his absence was noted.\n\u201cWhere is Kak\u00e1, who said Brazilians don\u2019t recognise their heroes?\u201d wrote Walter Casagrande J\u00fanior, an outspoken Brazilian columnist. \u201cWell, Kak\u00e1, after what we saw at Pel\u00e9\u2019s wake, it\u2019s clear that it is you who don\u2019t recognise major heroes.\u201d\nNeymar, who came through the ranks at Santos before leaving for Barcelona and becoming the world\u2019s most expensive footballer in 2017, was another who did not appear, with his father saying his son had asked him to represent him.\nCasagrande hinted that Kak\u00e1 and other millionaire footballers were used to getting paid for public appearances and he also suggested that Brazil\u2019s World Cup winners did not go because Pel\u00e9, who sometimes worked as a TV analyst, had criticised some of their past performances.\nWhatever the reason, the lack of star power jarred. One observer noted that David Beckham queued for hours to see the queen while Brazilian players did not avail themselves of special access through Santos\u2019 historic marble salon to see the man known universally as the King.\nThe contrast was especially dissonant given the massive outpouring of popular support shown to the local star.\n\nPel\u00e9\u2019s coffin was driven through Santos on Tuesday morning, from the stadium to the mausoleum where he was buried, and huge crowds turned out to accompany the procession.\n\u201cNone of us are ever going to forget this,\u201d Neto said in a message directed to the absent stars.\n\u201cAnyone can put a photo of Pel\u00e9 on their Instagram,\u201d he said about one easy tribute. \u201cWould it cost you to have given up two days of your holidays?\u201d"

                    "body": "Jordan Henderson has described Qatar\u2019s record of human rights abuses as \u201cshocking, disappointing and horrendous\u201d after he and his fellow England players received a detailed briefing on the situation in the Gulf state. It seems certain that Gareth Southgate\u2019s squad will issue a collective message challenging the stance taken by this year\u2019s World Cup host country towards the rights of women, the LGBTQ+ community and the migrant workers responsible for building the stadiums on show at Qatar 2022 among much other infrastructure.  \u201cWhen we were given the briefing, which was really important, it was quite shocking and disappointing,\u201d said the Liverpool captain as he prepared for a role in Southgate\u2019s midfield against Switzerland at Wembley on Saturday. \u201cIt\u2019s horrendous really when you look at some of the issues that are currently happening and have been happening over there. \u201cAs a team we\u2019re just sort of digesting that, coming up with ideas of what we want to do going forward because it\u2019s an opportunity to maybe shine a light on the issues and use our platforms to make change for the better.\u201d Southgate was joined by Mark Bullingham, the FA\u2019s chief executive, and Edleen John, its director of international relations, on Tuesday as they spent 30 minutes relaying detailed information from, among other sources, Amnesty to the squad at St George\u2019s Park. \u201cIt\u2019s provoked a lot of conversations among the players,\u201d England\u2019s manager said. \u201cThe FA have never stopped anybody speaking about these matters \u2026 And it would be dangerous for us to be telling them what to do on something like this; they have their own thoughts, their own minds, they\u2019re bright people.\u201d Despite his evident concerns about the human rights landscape in Doha and beyond, Southgate is adamant that boycotting the Middle East\u2019s first World Cup would have been pointless. \u201cI don\u2019t really know what that achieves,\u201d he said. \u201cIt would be a big story but the tournament would go ahead. \u201cThere are some things that are religious and cultural that are going to be very difficult to change but there\u2019s still an opportunity to use our voices and our platform in a positive way.\u201d In contrast, an England boycott would have achieved nothing, he said. \u201cUnfortunately the biggest issue that\u2019s non-religious and non-cultural is what happened with the building of the stadiums,\u201d said Southgate. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing we can do about that either, sadly.\u201d Globalisation and geopolitical reality also come into play. \u201cIs the stance against Qatar as a country?\u201d he queried. \u201cShould we protest against a country or a specific issue? If it\u2019s Qatar as a country we\u2019re intertwined. Are we going to stop shopping at Sainsbury\u2019s [whose largest shareholder is Qatar Holdings LLC] as a protest? Then there\u2019s the Shard; there\u2019s all sorts of Qatari property investment here. We\u2019re in such a complex world of deals, as we\u2019ve seen with Saudi Arabia. \u201cOn one hand people are questioning their investment in Newcastle and on the other hand we\u2019re going to Saudi and asking them to reduce the oil prices so we can get our petrol cheaper. It\u2019s extremely complicated.\u201d  After pointing out that the time to talk potential boycotts was the moment Qatar was awarded the tournament in 2010, Southgate advocated the benefits of engagement. \u201cIt [a boycott] is possible,\u201d he said. \u201cBut that\u2019s not a decision the players and myself can make. I hear various versions of this but my understanding is the discussions the FA had with organisations like Amnesty is that they feel there would be more change if we go and these things are highlighted.\u201d England\u2019s manager knows he cannot please everybody. \u201cWhatever we do we\u2019re going to be criticised,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we\u2019re going to do our best. There\u2019s power in us being able to do something \u2013 and maybe even with other European nations. Conversations are going on all the time.\u201d Henderson is at the heart of many such chats with teammates and international counterparts. \u201cAs a senior player I do take a lot of responsibility and I\u2019ll speak to as many lads as I can, as will other senior members of the team, and come up with something we all think\u2019s right,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd, as the gaffer said, there\u2019s the possibility of doing something with other European countries. \u201cWhatever we decide to do will be criticised and will never be enough but we do it to try and make a difference in the world. I think everybody knows we stand for no discrimination. Football\u2019s for everyone.\u201d"

Updated at 1.32pm GMT    1.26pm    \u201cRe Rob Wolf Peterson (12.33),\u201d emails Steve Wiles. \u201cI live in Bali too and I\u2019m glad to see our local team being repped on the MBM (HBH? Not sure what to call a warm up blog). I think you you should ask Rob to send a photo of the Bali United shirt though, the Proper Football Men in the UK who bemoan the amount of advertising on modern shirts would be apoplectic.\u201d     1.23pm    More on Brazil\u2019s injury news.      1.06pm    Reports in Brazil say Pele has been moved to palliative care at Albert Einstein Hospital in S\u00e3o Paulo, after he stopped responding to cancer treatment.      1.03pm    Ed Aarons on Senegal and how they plan to beat England.      12.53pm    In addition to Gabriel Jesus, Alex Telles is also out of the World Cup. Dani Alves is the only fit full-back available to Tite for the last-16 match. It\u2019s a good job they have plenty of people who can score goals.      12.49pm    Some big penalty statistics from the good folk at Opta.      12.45pm    Didier Deschamps knows France will not be able to breeze past Poland in their last-16 tie.  \u201cWill there be other surprises? I only believe what I see. Today, even a great nation, if she is not ready, can have unpleasant situations. All the games are difficult, last night too. All the teams are good and prepared. The players all play in good leagues. \u201cThis team (Poland) has had to defend in the first three games, defend a lot, and they defend very well. They love it. They have a hardcore of players with good experience. There is (Wojciech) Szczesny, (Kamil) Glik, (Robert) Lewandowski and you have to respect what this team does, they deserve to be there. Szczesny was decisive. \u201cMy players know that there will be a response. They have a lot of attacking options to cause problems for the opponent.\u201d     12.41pm    \u201cI don\u2019t know why anyone would pick the USA to win,\u201d says Joshua Reynolds. \u201cThey have trouble scoring goals against teams that don\u2019t even feature VVD. The Dutch might not be amazing but they will comfortably see off the USA.\u201d It\u2019s a big test for USA, that\u2019s for sure.     12.39pm    Senegal not too keen on the press.       12.33pm    \u201cAfternoon Will,\u201d afternoon Rob Wolf Petersen. \u201cCan\u2019t say I\u2019ve personally received many niche football gifts but my brother co-directed the original Next Goal Wins and I live in Bali, so his oldest owns both an American Samoa kit and a Bali United top. A fairly unusual one-two punch.\u201d That is good stuff.      12.24pm    England trained today. The remaining 25 players in the squad all featured and will be fit for tomorrow. Ben White, who left the camp earlier in the week due to personal reasons, is the only absentee.       12.16pm    Can Poland overcome France? Luke McLaughlin looks at the mood in Warsaw.       12.12pm    In relation to niche football gifts, Duncan Edwards emails: \u201cShortly after hearing the song \u201cDynamos versus Tornadoes\u201d by the Real Sounds of Africa, my sister happened to be visiting Zimbabwe and i managed to persuade her to bring back a couple of football shirts. Sadly not a prized Dynamos shirt (in honour of their midfield great Moses Chunga, commemorated by the Real Sounds), but I think maybe Black Rhinos and CAPS FC. That was a good niche present.\u201d Incredible stuff.      12.03pm    How can Germany bounce back from their World Cup failure? Philipp Lahm has a plan.      12.00pm    Nedum on Luis.      11.53am    \u201cPortugal\u2019s Cristiano Ronaldo became the first man to score at five different World Cups.\u201d Whatever you think of the man, it is an impressive sporting achievement.      11.49am    Cold War Steve is now my colleague. What a world.      11.35am    If you can\u2019t wait for Netherlands v USA later, Will Magee is on WSL duty. He has live updates from Manchester United v Aston Villa.      11.30am    Bad news for Brazil.       11.29am    \u201cBrazil did not face a shot on target until first-half stoppage time in their final game against Cameroon.\u201d Quite an impressive stat.     11.24am    As the United States prepare for Saturday\u2019s match with the Netherlands and an opportunity to reach the last eight of the World Cup for the first time in two decades, no single player has made a bigger impact than Adams, the Leeds United midfielder who has been the team\u2019s brightest star across three matches in Qatar, both on and off the pitch.      11.17am    Thanks for coming Uruguay.      11.03am    The great John Brewin revisits England\u2019s last knockout stage game against African opposition back in 1990.      10.46am    Kurt Perleberg asks a big question: \u201cWill the USMNT ever win the FIFA World Cup?\u201d I will say yes.     10.42am    The many emotions of a Didier Deschamps press conference.        10.37am    Switzerland boss Murat Yakin denied any assertions that politics were at the heart of two tense encounters in his side\u2019s 3-2 win over Serbia, insisting any rumours to the contrary were \u201cjust speculation\u201d. The Swiss\u2019 victory in a rematch of the 2018 group stage clash between the two sides propelled them into the last 16 as Group G runners-up in Qatar. That previous win in Russia stirred up controversy when Granit Xhaka and Xherdan Shaqiri, both of Albanian-Kosovan heritage, were fined for their goal celebrations \u2013 hand gestures imitating a double-headed eagle symbol similar to the one on the Albanian flag. Yakin, whose side will face Group H winners Portugal on Tuesday, shut down rumours any exchanges were politically charged, saying: \u201cWhat I saw was a Granit Xhaka who focused fully on football today and who performed very well. \u201cI don\u2019t know exactly what happened on the pitch. I just saw the players from Serbia crossing the sidelines, and I think other players tried to calm them down. \u201cI think that was just a very normal exchange, as it happens in football. You know, emotions are involved with such a game. Without emotions, I think that would be too much to expect. \u201cBut I think overall, we were in control. They challenged us to the last minute. We had to really push our limits. But yes, again, I don\u2019t know what happened exactly.\u201d He added: \u201cWe\u2019re very happy that we\u2019re now moving onto the round of 16, and I think everything else is just speculation and we\u2019ll have to wait and see.\u201d PA Media      10.19am    Jordan Henderson remembers the bad times.      10.01am    I received a Werder Bremen woolly hat so I could show my support for Niclas Fullkrug for the remainder of the tournament. Admittedly, Germany are out, so it doesn\u2019t help much. Maybe they can bring Fullkrug back as a pundit. What\u2019s the most niche football gift you\u2019ve received?      9.56am    After witnessing the group stage, who are you backing to win the tournament? I can\u2019t look past Brazil\u2019s arsenal of attackers. They have so many options up top, they will be very hard to stop.      9.44am    Son Heung-min described South Korea\u2019s agonising wait for confirmation of their place in World Cup knockout rounds \u201cthe longest six minutes of my life\u201d after their 2-1 win over Portugal on Friday saw them advance to the last 16.The Korean captain set up Hwang Hee-chan to score a 91st-minute winner against Fernando Santos\u2019 side and leave the Taeguk Warriors hoping Uruguay would be unable to add to their two-goal lead over Ghana in the other Group H match.Another goal would have taken Uruguay into the last 16 at Korea\u2019s expense on goal-difference and the squad huddled together on the Education City Stadium pitch watching on digital devices as the South Americans ultimately fell short.\u201cIt was the longest six minutes of my life, but in the circle we were really positive,\u201d said Son, who will be playing in the World Cup knockout rounds for the first time in his career.\u201cI said: if Uruguay score one more goal, I\u2019m very proud of this team and very happy that you gave it everything and we will see what\u2019s going to happen. We were just waiting, but it was a long wait.\u201d Reuters.       9.41am    Louis van Gaal has been linked with the vacant Belgium national team job but he has more immediate matters to deal with, starting today against USA. \u201cWe want to become world champions so we\u2019ve got another four matches ahead of us and then we\u2019ll see whether there are any offers on the table,\u201d Van Gaal said through a translator. \u201cIf we become world champions, everybody is so opportunistic in this football world that there will be offers. I know that full well. \u201cBut for the moment we are not world champions. And if I have to believe the Dutch media, we will never become world champions.\u201d     9.27am    It is Australia v Argentina later. Graham Arnold has played in the fixture before. A certain D Maradona was playing that day.       9.17am    Due to the World Cup, there were a few League One and Two games last night.       9.14am    The great Karen Carney on England v Senegal.      9.10am    Kurt Perleberg is backing the Americans: \u201cThe USMNT will defeat the Netherlands today.\u201d Conclusive.      9.06am    Nedum Onuoha has been on Sky Sports News backing USA to overcome Netherlands. Is anyone else in the same boat? There is plenty of attacking talent in the USMNT squad but I fear their defence is a touch suspect.      8.57am    England are four matches away from winning the World Cup. Jonathan Wilson asks \u2018but are they any good at football?\u2019.      8.47am    Naturally, while my colleagues are off galavanting in Doha, I have been speaking to the former manager of a non-league team. Do not worry, it is very much World Cup-related. Two Senegal players have represented non-league teams in England. Can you name the other?      8.40am    We should remind ourselves of yesterday\u2019s action.  Starting with Serbia v Switzerland.  Barney Ronay\u2019s analysis.   The match report.   And Cameroon v Brazil.      8.36am    Barney Ronay has been looking at the Aspire project and how it\u2019s influence.       8.30am   Preamble  The group stages are over, so it is time to relax. Oh, the knockout stages begin today. The action kicks off with Netherlands v USA at 3pm and concludes with Argentina v Australia in the evening. Betting folk would back the Dutch and Argentinians to progress but this tournament has not been a simple one. Elsewhere, there is plenty to build up to in the coming days, including England\u2019s match tomorrow night against Senegal. Gareth Southgate\u2019s side are back to get to the quarters but their opponents will be desperate to cause an upset. As well as looking forward, I suspect there will be some fallout from yesterday. Uruguay\u2019s upset with the officials and TV monitors might cause a few problems for them and Granit Xhaka\u2019s alleged naughtiness might be assessed by Fifa.  "

Although England\u2019s exit in the quarter-finals meant this year\u2019s World Cup did not reach record-breaking audience levels, the contest between France and Argentina shows there is still an enormous live television audience for free-to-air football. The promise of a showdown between Lionel Messi and Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 \u2013 and cold weather keeping Britons inside \u2013 meant the British audience was substantially up on the 2018 World Cup final between France and Croatia. The overnight television audience figures, produced by data provider Digital-i, do not include the millions of Britons likely to have watched the match on streaming services such as iPlayer and ITVX, or in communal places such as pubs.  While the BBC was praised for its coverage \u2013 including a stunning closing montage set to Frankie Goes to Hollywood\u2019s The Power of Love \u2013 ITV is likely to have been pleased with relatively strong ratings for the one match it shared with its rival broadcaster. Among those watching ITV\u2019s coverage were staff at the Daily Mail, who led Monday\u2019s print newspaper with a criticism of Neville\u2019s comments comparing the treatment of Qatari migrant workers to striking staff in the UK. The newspaper used its front page to declare that Neville had \u201csparked fury\u201d with his comments, where he said the world should detest low pay, poor accommodation, and poor working conditions regardless of where they are in the world. Neville, who received criticism before the tournament after taking work with Qatari broadcaster BeIN sports, said he saw parallels with the treatment of British NHS staff. \u201cIt shouldn\u2019t happen here,\u201d he said, from his seat in Doha. \u201cBut it shouldn\u2019t happen with the nurses in our country either where our nurses are having to fight for an extra pound or two pounds.\u201d"

It\u2019s not true, what can I say? I have the feeling he is incredibly happy here and we will try to make him happy.\n\u201cYou cannot worry about the rumours, we have to worry about what we can control.\u201d\nHaaland was substituted at half\u2011time to preserve him for a hectic fixture period in the buildup to the World Cup, which starts in six weeks. But it appears Walker\u2019s availability for England is in doubt after Guardiola said he was unsure whether the injury which forced the defender from the field during the first half of the Manchester derby on Sunday could result in him missing the tournament.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Guardiola said when asked about the extent of Walker\u2019s injury. \u201cIt\u2019s something abdominal, it may be a while. I know how important the World Cup is for the players but he has an abdominal injury. It will be weeks.\u201d\nThe news would be a major setback for Gareth Southgate, with Walker almost certain to start for England in Qatar if fit and available. England begin their World Cup campaign with a group\u2011stage clash against Iran on 21 November, before subsequent games against USA and Wales. Walker\u2019s absence would leave Southgate with a significant hole in his defence to fill."

                    "body": "Shortly after Adam Smith\u2019s own goal gave Newcastle the lead, the Gallowgate End broke into a brief chorus of \u201cWe\u2019re going to Wemberlee\u201d but it was strangely half-hearted and soon died in the cool Tyneside night air.\nBy the final whistle Eddie Howe\u2019s side had made it to the quarter-finals but the overall stodginess of the performance explained their fans\u2019 unusual lack of animation. It seems there is still some considerable warming up to be done before they visit Leicester on Premier League business on Boxing Day.\n\n\u201cWe weren\u2019t at our fluent best but we\u2019ll be better for that game,\u201d said Howe. \u201cWe needed competitive action. Bournemouth made it difficult for us, they were very deep and compact and, to a certain extent we played into their hands but part of the reason we struggled to break them down was simply due to not playing together for a while. We know there\u2019s a lot more to come from our team.\u201d\nOne Newcastle player exempt from ring rustiness was Sven Botman who excelled at centre-half, handling Bournemouth\u2019s dangerous Wales striker Kieffer Moore superbly throughout.\nAvoiding relegation remains Gary O\u2019Neil\u2019s priority but that did not prevent him marking his first game as Bournemouth\u2019s permanent manager by naming a strong side. O\u2019Neil\u2019s only problem was that Howe\u2019s starting XI was similarly packed with regular first choices including a quintet of players recently returned from the World Cup.\nWhile Callum Wilson, Kieran Trippier, Nick Pope, Bruno Guimar\u00e3es and Fabian Sch\u00e4r spent part of the last five weeks in Qatar the rest of Newcastle\u2019s squad have recently returned from a warm weather training camp in Saudi Arabia. Maybe their sluggish start had something to do with the shock of being plunged back into a chill north-east winter? Perhaps everyone was simply defrosting?\nThe excitement fuelled by Newcastle\u2019s rise to third in the top tier allied to a rare cup run, dictated that the \u201csold out\u201d signs went up at St James\u2019 Park three weeks ago but a near full house had little to cheer until the 26th minute when Wilson\u2019s shot evaded Mark Travers.\nWith a very late linesman\u2019s flag signalling a contentious offside against a prone Joe Willock the applause proved shortlived as that effort was disallowed.\n\nWilson\u2019s attacking partner Miguel Almir\u00f3n should have scored as half-time beckoned but a forward who could not stop scoring before the World Cup somehow missed from close range following Dan Burn\u2019s stellar overlap.\nHowe\u2019s side at least succeeded in upping the second-half tempo. Maybe the virus which had ripped through O\u2019Neil\u2019s squad was taking its toll but, with Botman consistently second-guessing Moore and company, Bournemouth ran out of ideas.\nYet for all Newcastle\u2019s possession they lacked penalty-area sharpness and very nearly paid for it as Moore\u2019s menacing diving header swerved narrowly wide following Smith\u2019s fine cross.\nShortly afterwards Smith\u2019s head sunk into his hands after his own goal changed the narrative. It originated with a typically impressive right-wing cross whipped in by Trippier and, although that delivery was intended for Wilson, Bournemouth\u2019s captain ended up doing the striker\u2019s job for him.\n\nWith Newcastle\u2019s No 9 seemingly thawing out nicely, Smith was placed under considerable pressure as they jumped for the ball and merely succeeded in heading into his own net.\nThere was still time for Pope to save brilliantly from Dominic Solanke but Howe\u2019s side \u2013 who arguably should have had a penalty following Chris Mepham\u2019s apparent handball \u2013 had done enough to eliminate his old employers.\n\u201cI was pleased with our resilience,\u201d said O\u2019Neil. \u201cThe boys were competitive against a top side.\u201d"

                    "body": "Saud Abdulhamid\nSaudi Arabia and Al Hilal\nThere was plenty to analyse when Saudi Arabia shocked Argentina in their opening game. A lot of focus was put on the lacklustre efforts of the Argentinians, who were beaten by the better team on the day. One of the key giantkillers was the right-back Abdulhamid, who has 26 caps \u2013 not bad for a 23-year-old. His hero is Brazil\u2019s Dani Alves, which explains the marauding nature of his play up and down the flank. He brings speed, pinpoint tackling and is comfortable in possession, as well as being a set-piece specialist and having the adaptability to operate in midfield. Clubs in Europe have taken note after his impressive efforts, with Sevilla, Milan and Juventus scouts monitoring his progress. He has captained his country, a sign of his importance for Saudi Arabia, and is tipped to lead them in the years to come. WU\nYassine \u2018Bono\u2019 Bounou\nMorocco and Sevilla\nSevilla\u2019s status as a foremost club in polishing talent continued in Qatar through the brilliance of Morocco\u2019s goalkeeper, though perhaps his status as a Europa League winner who played a crucial part in their 2020 final win over Inter ought not to have made him such a breakout star. Those two penalty saves against Spain, the country where he has played for the past decade, and his command of Morocco\u2019s excellent, tightly drilled defence mark him out as one of the World Cup\u2019s major talents. Canada-born and multilingual, the 31-year-old will be on any list for scouts looking for an experienced, organising goalkeeper who has shown himself to be adaptable. And Sevilla always have a price for their talent. JB\n\nRitsu Doan\nJapan and Freiburg\nJapan\u2019s defeats of Germany and Spain will live long in national memory and followed a similar pattern. Once Doan came on the field, everything changed. Four minutes after his arrival in the first game, Doan equalised against the country where he has played his football, first for Arminia Bielefeld and, since the summer, Freiburg. Then, against Spain, Doan came on at half-time and scored within three minutes. That his team lost both games Doan started does, though, throw questions up against a player occasionally referred to as \u201cJapan\u2019s Messi\u201d. He previously struggled to make an impact at PSV Eindhoven but after five years in European football anyone who can harness a winger of withering speed and a latent goal threat running beyond the strikers will have a serious asset to call upon. In this era of five substitutes, impact players have increased in premium. JB\nA\u00efssa La\u00efdouni\nTunisia and Ferencvaros\nAmong the litany of goalless draws at the start of the tournament came a classic of the genre in Denmark v Tunisia. La\u00efdouni excelled in a game played in high heat and dominated a talented, experienced Denmark midfield with his energy and devilment, making one lung-bursting run after another. In that game, and against Australia, he was substituted when he could give no more, but his capacity for putting himself about was hugely striking. When Tunisia completed a historic win over France in their final group game, La\u00efdouni was again in the vanguard. The Ferencvaros player, lately linked with Celtic, would seem ideal for a high-pressing team. Born in France, and after starting his career with Angers, he has played in Romania and now Hungary, this season competing in the Europa League for that country\u2019s champions. JB\n\nDominik Livakovic\nCroatia and Dinamo Zagreb\nThe goalkeeper made himself a shootout hero in Croatia\u2019s wins over Japan and Brazil but his consistency as well as his penalty saves have made him the tournament\u2019s standout goalkeeper, despite giving away a spot-kick in the semi-final defeat by Argentina. Livakovic has spent his entire career in Zagreb, first at NK before moving to Dinamo, where he has won five domestic titles. He was part of the Croatia squad that finished runners-up four years ago, but watched from the bench as understudy to one of his heroes, Danijel Subasic. Since then, the 27-year-old has become his country\u2019s No 1 thanks to his reflexes and imposing nature in the box. He has been linked with Bayern Munich in recent weeks and could attract plenty more interest in the winter transfer window. WU\nAzzedine Ounahi\nMorocco and Angers\nAfter Morocco had seen off Spain in a shootout, Luis Enrique could have been forgiven for feeling disappointed, but he took time to praise his opponents, singling out Ounahi. The midfielder made his international debut in January at the Africa Cup of Nations and was playing in the French third tier 18 months ago. He is now with Ligue 1\u2019s bottom club, Angers, but has the confidence of a man playing at a higher level. Ounahi has spent the tournament breaking the lines in midfield, providing constant energy, while also being key in a Morocco setup that was hard to break down. He has a contract until 2025 at Angers, who would be smart to sell the 22-year-old in January with his price rightly high thanks to helping his country to the semi\u2011finals. WU\n\nHarry Souttar\nAustralia and Stoke\nAustralia\u2019s success derived much from an alliance of A-League graduates and players of Scottish origin. Souttar, whose older brother, John, plays for Rangers and Scotland, is an Aberdonian with a Western Australian mother. His dreadnought defending laid foundations for famous wins over Tunisia and Denmark as the Socceroos reached the last 16. Three seasons ago, he was on loan at Fleetwood. Stoke, who signed him from Dundee United in 2016, had been denied his services for the past year by a cruciate injury. He had played one club game this season, against Luton on 8 November, before flying out to become an Australian national hero. At 6ft 6in, he dominated the air traffic and Graham Arnold, his national manager, has been only too happy to recommend him to Premier League suitors: \u201cI\u2019d be banging on his door real quick. He\u2019s that good.\u201d He was quickly back in action with Stoke at home to Cardiff last Saturday and is in line to feature at Bristol City on Saturday. JB"

Thanks for your company and emails \u2013 goodnight.      5.13pm    I\u2019m trying to think of strikers who have had an equivalent shocker to Lukaku at the World Cup. Even poor old Serginho didn\u2019t miss that many chances. Football is a strange game; if that first shot had been an inch to the left, Lukaku would probably be the hero right now.  Updated at 5.14pm GMT    5.10pm    \u201cAfternoon Rob,\u201d says Stephen Carr. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing revelatory in the following statement but it\u2019s one worth making nonetheless - Croatia\u2019s midfield is bloody brilliant.\u201d Just lovely, aren\u2019t they. Mateo Kovacic is such a good footballer.     5.07pm   Roberto Martinez speaks   We didn\u2019t play well in the first two games but today we were ready, we created many, many opportunities. There are no regrets about today \u2013 we can leave with our head held high. [Is the golden generation over?] No, no. You\u2019ve got players like [Tielemans, Doku, Onana]\u2026 the golden generation can be carried on by these young players. We wanted to go all the way, we couldn\u2019t go out of the group. Today is a way to lose that you can accept. [Do you want to stay as Belgium coach?] Now is not the moment.      5.05pm    Before this game, Lukaku had played only 38 minutes since August, and the BBC panel \u2013 Gary Lineker, Alan Shearer, Didier Drogba \u2013 all agree that his performance was full of rust. He also punched a perspex screen in the dugout on the way off the field; you can\u2019t really blame him.  Updated at 5.20pm GMT    5.02pm         5.00pm    \u201cPoor Lukaku,\u201d says Jeffrey Lilly, \u201cFour years, at least, of nightmares and what-ifs ahead. I wouldn\u2019t wish that on anyone.\u201d The cruellest thing is that he was finally about to score when Gvardiol made that incredible tackle.     4.59pm    It\u2019s not certain, but the likeliest scenario is that Morocco will meet Germany or Japan in the last 16, with Croatia facing Spain in a repeat of the Euro 2020 quarter-final triller. Then again, Costa Rica might surprise us all and win the group like they did in 2014.      4.58pm    Group F  Morocco 7pts Croatia 5 Belgium 4 Canada 0      4.57pm    Belgium, don\u2019t forget, are second in the world rankings. I don\u2019t think many people expected them to win it, but even fewer thought they would go out in the group stage. Toby Alderweireld is also in tears, and Thierry Henry is going round consoling a few of the players.   Updated at 5.03pm GMT    4.56pm    Morocco win the group, Croatia finish second \u2013 but the story of this game is Belgium, whose golden age is over. Poor Romelu Lukaku, who missed some unbelievable chances, is in tears. Most of the other players are sitting down, trying to process this crushing failure.      4.55pm   Full time: Croatia 0-0 Belgium  And Belgium are out of the World Cup!   Updated at 4.57pm GMT    4.54pm    90+4 min Belgium have 20 seconds to comply.     4.54pm    90+3 min Gvardiol is 20 years old. Spoiler alert: he\u2019s not going to be at RB Leipzig next season.   Updated at 4.56pm GMT    4.53pm    90+2 min: Amazing defending from Gvardiol! A deep cross from the left ricochets back across the area towards Lukaku, who is about to leather it into the net from four yards when Gvardiol stretches to make a stunning tackle. Absolutely brilliant!  Updated at 4.53pm GMT    4.52pm    90+1 min Four minutes of added time. Croatia bring on Lovro Majer for Mateo Kovacic. On that Lukaku chance, Dejan Lovren is so lucky because he made a Horlicks of a fairly routine defensive header.     4.51pm    90 min: Another chance for Lukaku! This is astonishing. Thorgan Hazard\u2019s brilliant cross beats the leaping Livakovic at the near post; Lovren misses his header and the ball hits Lukaku, five yards out in front of a completely open goal, before rolling miserably into the arms of Livakovic.   Updated at 4.54pm GMT    4.49pm    89 min \u201cWhen did the term \u2018golden generation\u2019 start getting so liberally applied?\u201d wonders David Wall. \u201cI first remember it used about that group of Portuguese players including Rui Costa and Figo, almost all of whom had played together in winning (I think) one of the World Cups at youth level.  \u201cThat makes sense, that specific group had actually won something, and then continued as a group into the senior side. But since then it just gets applied to any group of good players all around the same age, whether they progress through the age group teams together, and whether they ever win anything. All it does is create unjustified expectations.\u201d Funnily enough I\u2019m researching this for the Knowledge. I also think it started with that Portugal game. I have a vague memory of Adam Crozier being the first person to use it in reference to England. All will be revealed in a future Knowledge. Wait, come back\u2026     4.48pm    88 min That Lukaku chance was probably a bit harder than it looked. Even so, he has had two, maybe three, terrific opportunities since coming on at half-time.     4.48pm    85 min: Belgium substition The former artist known as Eden Hazard replaces Thomas Meunier.     4.47pm    87 min: Lukaku misses from four yards! Unbelievable. A cross from the left is headed up in the air and drops to Meunier on the right side of the area. He cushions it towards Lukaku, who can\u2019t sort his feet out quickly enough and shins the ball this far wide.   Updated at 5.03pm GMT    4.46pm    86 min Nothing comes of the corner.      4.46pm    85 min After a mix-up between Gvardiola and Livakovic, De Bruyne\u2019s cross deflects into the side netting. Corner to Belgium\u2026     4.45pm    84 min Doku beats Juranovic with thrilling ease on the left, but his cutback is poor and Brozovic heads clear.     4.44pm    83 min Gvardiol\u2019s inadvertent backpass is saved comfortably by Livakovic. Belgium want an indirect free-kick but it wasn\u2019t deliberate.     4.43pm    82 min Croatia have kept Belgium at arm\u2019s length for most of the second half. There have been one or two moments, most notably when Lukaku hit the post, but on balance Croatia deserve at least a draw.     4.42pm    81 min Kovacic wanders infield from the left and plays a superb pass to release Juranovic on the right side of the area. His cutback, alas, is dreadful, straight to Witsel.     4.40pm    79 min Perisic\u2019s teasing cross is headed away crucially by Castagne at the far post. This is terrific stuff.   Updated at 4.45pm GMT    4.39pm    78 min Thorgan Hazard\u2019s corner is headed off Pasalic and over the bar by Vertonghen. Anthony Taylor gives a goalkick, a decision with which Vertonghen is not entirely enamoured.     4.38pm    77 min A neat lay-off from Petkovic releases Perisic on the halfway line. He runs all the way to the edge of the Belgium penalty area but then dithers and it was tackled by Vertonghen. That was unusually indecisive from Perisic.     4.37pm    77 min \u201cCommentators being very harsh on Lukaku on the TV,\u201d says Richard Hirst. \u201cHe was on the half turn and had to keep the ball away from the reach of goalkeeper and defender; I reckon he did as well as he could.\u201d I mean, Gerd Muller would have scored it, but I know what you mean. It wasn\u2019t an open goal.     4.37pm    77 min \u201cCroatia might want to consider scoring and putting Belgium to bed,\u201d says Mary Waltz. \u201cCroatia is the better team but KDB and a real target striker is a scary thing.\u201d      4.36pm    76 min Perisic does absurdly well to win the ball near the byline and find Petkovic, but his shot is blocked.     4.35pm    75 min Croatia look reasonably comfortable just now, though the mood can change very quickly in a match like this.     4.35pm    74 min What a time this would be for Kevin De Bruyne to assert his greatness. Though there are exceptions, most notably against Brazil in 2018, he hasn\u2019t always been brilliant in the stratospheric matches.   Updated at 4.37pm GMT    4.32pm    72 min: Double substitution for Belgium Youri Tielemans and Jeremy Doku replace Leander Dendoncker and Yannick Carrasco.     4.32pm    71 min Croatia\u2019s midfield three have kept the ball beautifully at times in the second half.      4.31pm    70 min Romelu Lukaku is a strange mix of the unstoppable and the vulnerable. At his best he\u2019s frightening, but most of Belgium\u2019s exits from major tournaments have involved him missing a sitter.      4.29pm    69 min De Bruyne clips a rising drive on the run from an absurd angle. Livakovic\u2019s positioning is good and he saves comfortably.     4.28pm    68 min Courtois leaps to his left to make a comfortable save from Modric, who did well to improvise a flicked shot from just inside the area.     4.27pm    67 min Dendoncker is booked for a foul on the increasingly influential Kovacic.     4.27pm    67 min Here\u2019s Big Rom\u2019s first chance.      4.26pm    66 min \u201cA 104-game World Cup,\u201d muses Chris Ward. \u201cWhy not just go the whole hog and turn it into a Swiss league format?\u201d     4.26pm    65 min The first half was almost entirely malodorous, but it\u2019s a cracking game now.     4.25pm    64 min: Double substitution for Croatia Mario Pasalic and Bruno Petkovic replace Andrej Kramaric and Marko Livaja.     4.24pm    62 min: Another chance for Lukaku! De Bruyne\u2019s cross from the left nicks off the head of Lovren, taking Livakovic out of the game in the process, and is headed over an open goal by Lukaku. That really was a sitter, although I\u2019m not sure it would have counted \u2013 it looked like the ball was out of play before De Bruyne crossed it.   Updated at 4.26pm GMT    4.22pm    61 min: Lukaku hits the post! What a chance for Belgium! De Bruyne put Carrasco through on goal with a subtle, angled through pass. His shot was blocked brilliantly by Juranovic, stretching just in front of the goalkeeper, and Lukaku slapped the loose ball off the inside of the near post! It wasn\u2019t an open goal \u2013 the keeper Livakovic was back on his feet and there was a defender nearby as well \u2013 but it was still a helluva chance.   Updated at 4.24pm GMT    4.20pm    60 min \u201cI certainly understand the logic behind keeping the World Cup at 32 teams,\u201d says Matt Burtz. \u201cHowever, I do think its expansion to 48 is beneficial. There are currently 211 FIFA member nations, so even with the expansion not even a quarter of nations will qualify. It\u2019s not like the Faroe Islands are going to be up against Brazil. \u201cAlso, if this World Cup has shown anything, it\u2019s that so-called lightweights can certainly mix it up with the big boys. Almost everyone agrees that Africa is underrepresented, and South America could absolutely merit another team or two coming in. Throw in a few more from Europe and I say you have a pretty good mix.\u201d One hundred and four games though. I\u2019m still in therapy for the 2007 cricket World Cup, which went on forever.   Updated at 4.33pm GMT    4.19pm    59 min: Belgium substitution Leandro Trossard is replaced by Thorgan Hazard.     4.18pm    57 min Croatia are much the better team at the moment. They work the ball nicely through midfield again, but then Sosa overhits his cross.     4.17pm    57 min \u201cRight idea to ditch the pointless groups of three bonfire of a plan,\u201d says Steve Murray. \u201cBut wrong to put the best eight third-placed teams into a knockout round of 32. Far better to send the top two from each group through but to give the top eight a bye. The remaining 16 would play off to reach the last 16 proper against the best eight. Would mean no second strings for the final group games as they\u2019d be playing for a few extra days\u2019 rest.\u201d Though I like the logic, that sounds a bit too much like the IPL. Then again I suppose you could say that about the best third-placed teams going through. I\u2019m sure we agree on one thing: 104 games is no way to treat your golden goose.  Updated at 4.19pm GMT    4.15pm    54 min: Two more good saves from Courtois! This is a decent game now. Brozovic curls a low shot from 20 yards that is shovelled away by Courtois, plunging to his right. Moments later he makes his third good save of the half, again diving low to his right to push away Modric\u2019s left-footed shot.  Updated at 4.16pm GMT    4.12pm    51 min After good hold-up play from Lukaku, who looks sharp and up for it, De Bruyne shoots over from 20 yards with his left foot.     4.11pm    50 min The corner is taken short and half cleared to Sosa, who blisters a half volley over the bar from distance.     4.11pm    50 min: Good save from Courtois! They were almost two goals away. Gvardiol rumbled forward and stabbed a pass to Kovacic just inside the area. He took a touch and spanked a rising drive that was pawed over the bar by Courtois. A good save, though one he\u2019d expect to make.  Updated at 4.11pm GMT    4.10pm    50 min For all the doom, gloom and ageism, Belgium are one goal away from the last 16.     4.09pm    49 min De Bruyne stands up a deep cross that is headed straight at Livakovic by Lukaku. To be honest he did well just to win the header.   Updated at 4.14pm GMT    4.09pm    48 min De Bruyne makes just another space to put in a wicked cross from the right. Gvardiol leaps to shin it behind for a corner, an important interception with Lukaku waiting behind him.     4.06pm    46 min Peep peep! Belgium have made a half-time substitution: Romelu Lukaku replaces Dries Mertens.     3.53pm    \u201cThis is drek,\u201d says Joe Pearson. \u201cOn this evidence I don\u2019t want either of these teams to progress.\u201d I don\u2019t really blame Croatia, as they only need a draw, although they\u2019ll regret their passivity if Big Rom scores a 114th-minute winner.  Updated at 4.06pm GMT    3.52pm   Half time: Croatia 0-0 Belgium  As things stand, Belgium are going of the World Cup with a whimper. They created only one clear chance, missed by Dries Mertens, in a bloodless first half. Still, it could have been worse: Anthony Taylor award Croatia a penalty for a foul by Yannick Carrasco, only to change his mind after a VAR intervention.  Updated at 3.52pm GMT    3.52pm    Half-time reading I mean, it\u2019s probably preferable to groups of three, but it still reeks of avarice, fatigue and mismatches. One hundred and four games.   Updated at 3.53pm GMT    3.51pm    45+4 min Juranovic smashes a volley wide from the edge of the area, the last touch of the kind of half that gives 0-0s a bad name.     3.47pm    45+2 min \u201cAs the mind wanders during the first half, I got to thinking that when you see close-ups of Luka Modri\u0107 you get the sense that he\u2019s the most haggard-looking 16-year-old the world has ever seen,\u201d says Charles Antaki. \u201cLuis Enrique has the same fleshless look, but seems a good 50 years older, and also somehow much fitter. Oh and now a shot on, or at least near, goal.\u201d   Updated at 3.55pm GMT    3.47pm    45 min Four minutes of added time.     3.47pm    45 min At the other end, Sosa has a pop from distance, and unwittingly homages his namesake.      3.46pm    44 min A lovely low cross from De Bruyne is well claimed by the diving Livakovic. That was crying out for someone like Romelu Lukaku at the near post, but Mertens was slightly on his heels.     3.44pm    43 min It\u2019s Croatia 0-0 Belgium, and that\u2019s the shots on target.     3.43pm    42 min Better from Belgium. Dendoncker beats a defender in the area, gets to the byline and cuts the ball back towards Mertens in the six-yard box. He can\u2019t quite there and the ball runs across the area to safety.     3.42pm    41 min Canada have pulled one back against Morocco. If they get five more, Belgium will go through.      3.41pm    41 min A reminder that the winner of this game will play Spain, Germany, Japan or Costa Rica. As things stand it would be Spain but that is entirely irrelevant so I\u2019m not sure why I posted it.  Updated at 3.42pm GMT    3.40pm    40 min A precis of the excitement in the last 20 minutes:   Updated at 3.47pm GMT    3.40pm    39 min \u201cPoor Belgium really need a mate to tell them that flames on your clothes don\u2019t make you look cool,\u201d says Josse McMahon. You say that, but Japan managed it.      3.37pm    37 min I wonder how fit Romelu Lukaku is. We might see him at half-time, because playing Leandro Trossard as a No9 hasn\u2019t worked so far.   Updated at 3.40pm GMT    3.36pm    37 min \u201cWhatever the outcome of this exciting encounter, I\u2019m delighted that Dries Mertens (a former Napoli player who enjoyed cult status in Naples and a special relationship with the fans, earning the nickname Ciro) has been chosen ahead of the mighty Eden Hazard,\u201d says Colum Fordham. \u201cAt the age of 35, I think we can safely say it is Mertens\u2019 last iteration in this tournament and he deserves his chance. A fast, quick-witted player who became Napoli\u2019s top goalscorer (148), ahead of one Diego Armando Maradona (115).\u201d     3.36pm    36 min Belgium are having a lot of the ball, but their passing has been so slow.      3.35pm    34 min \u201cIn fairness to Croatia,\u201d says Justin Kavanagh, \u201cI\u2019m sure all Liverpool fans will agree that it\u2019s not often Lovren is caught interfering with play.\u201d     3.34pm    33 min Sosa\u2019s deep cross is headed just over by the backpedalling Livaja, a decent effort in the circumstances. He did well to loop it back across goal but couldn\u2019t drop it under the bar.     3.32pm    31 min This is really dull. I blame Dejan Lovren for being a micrometre offside.      3.30pm    29 min \u201cHas anyone done the math (as they say here in the US of A) on the number of caps on display here?\u201d says Chris Willimer. \u201cModric has 157, Vertinghon on 144, Alderweireld 126, Perisic 118. De Bruyne has 97, even Lovren has 74. Is this the most decorated match ever?\u201d Good question. I might nick that for next week\u2019s Knowledge. I know that all seven Belgian players with 100 caps are in their squad, though Lukaku and Eden Hazard are on the bench.     3.28pm    27 min Modric\u2019s corner is headed away by Witsel. The game hasn\u2019t got going at all since Anthony Taylor reversed his penalty decision.     3.27pm         3.26pm    25 min As things stand Morocco will win the group, and probably avoid Spain in the second round. They could well have a 1986 rematch with Germany.     3.26pm    25 min \u201cRules are rules and all that, but in that move, essentially what happened was one player fouled another in the area,\u201d says Ant Ashworth. \u201cPenalty. He gained no advantage from being that offside position, really. All this is sucking much of the joy out of football.\u201d Yes, there is a concern that VAR has made us even more pedantic. I think I preferred it when you had to touch the ball, or invading the goalkeeper\u2019s personal space, to be offside.     3.25pm    24 min Morocco are now 2-0 up against Canada. That means this game is a fight to the death. Belgium need a win, Croatia will go through with a draw.      3.25pm    23 min That VAR delay has taken the heat out of a game that was warming up nicely.     3.22pm    21 min Anyway, as you were. It was Lovren who was adjudged offside. Croatia might argue that Vertonghen won the header anyway, so Lovren didn\u2019t impact the play. I can see both sides! It was also a spandex-tight offside, so I can understand why Croatia are hacked off.  Updated at 3.23pm GMT    3.20pm    NO PENALTY! It\u2019s offside! It wasn\u2019t Kramaric, it was another player, possibly Lovren. He didn\u2019t touch the ball but he did challenge with Vertonghen. The BBC commentators don\u2019t understand why Anthony Taylor went to the monitor, when offsides are supposed to be automated, but it\u2019s pretty clear \u2013 they wanted him to decide whether Lovren (or whoever it was) was interfering with play. I\u2019d happily put VAR in a shallow grave but the procedure there was perfectly fine.     Updated at 3.26pm GMT    3.18pm    Vertonghen originally headed Modric\u2019s free-kick away, under pressure from Kramaric, who was in an offside position when the free-kick was taken. Anthony Taylor is going to the monitor to decide whether Kramaric was interfering with play.  Updated at 3.21pm GMT    3.17pm    VAR check I think this might be offside you know.     3.17pm    Modric\u2019s free-kick wasn\u2019t properly cleared, and Carrasco dangled a lazy leg in the direction of Kramaric. He felt the contact and went down, and Anthony Taylor had no choice.  Updated at 3.17pm GMT    3.16pm    15 min: PENALTY TO CROATIA! Oh dear.     3.15pm    13 min: Chance for Mertens! Belgium are playing well here. De Bruyne leads a counter-attack, running 50 yards before angling a through pass to Mertens. He runs round the ball, just inside the area, but curls high and wide. That was a terrific chance.     3.13pm    12 min: Good save! Mertens gets round the back on the right and slides a low cross beyond the far post. Carrasco controls it and whacks a shot from a tight angle that is kicked behind by the keeper Livakovic. I\u2019m not certain the shot was going in, though Livakovic didn\u2019t know that.     3.12pm    11 min \u201cFeels a bit harsh on Lukaku and Brozovic to say this is their last ever World Cup - both will still be 33 when the next iteration comes around,\u201d says Ben Blatch-Hanlon. I also imagine Kevin De Bruyne may well have something to say about being ruled out of playing in the next one when he\u2019s just about to turn 35 - if Modric can do it...!\u201d I didn\u2019t say it would be, only that it might. You make fair points on De Bruyne and Brozovic. I\u2019m not sure about Lukaku, though \u2013 he started very young and has a lot of miles on the clock.      3.11pm    10 min Carrasco cuts inside from the left and has a shot blocked, then Alderweireld almost puts Mertens through on goal with a long, driven pass.     3.09pm    9 min \u201cConsidering Bobby M\u2019s managerial career so far and his Boris Johnson-esque talent for failing upwards,\u201d begins Shaun Wilkinson, \u201cI fully expect him to lose his job after this tournament, and then be managing Spain by the next Euros.\u201d     3.09pm    8 min Belgium have settled down after that nervous start. In fact, nothing much has happened in the last five minutes.     3.08pm    6 min Belgium\u2019s formation is indeed a 4-2-3-1, with Mertens playing behind Trossard and occasionally swapping positions. De Bruyne is roaming from the right and Carrasco is on the left.  Updated at 3.09pm GMT    3.07pm    5 min There\u2019s been an early goal in the other game, and it\u2019s bad news for both Belgium and Croatia.      3.05pm    4 min \u201cOh, we\u2019re carrying on with the World Cup, are we?\u201d says Matt Dony. \u201cI figured it had finished on Tuesday evening. I don\u2019t pay much attention to the Belgium media, but is it full of people wondering whether their Golden Generation is being ruined by De Bruyne and Witsel not being able to play with each other, and a foreign coach in thrall to star players?\u201d Arf, very good.   Updated at 3.12pm GMT    3.04pm    2 min This is a seriously shaky start from Belgium, who have already had to make a couple of desperate challenges in their own area. The formation looks like 4-2-3-1 by the way, with Dendoncker and Witsel in midfield.  Updated at 3.05pm GMT    3.02pm    Just wide from Perisic! Croatia almost score after eight seconds! Straight from the kick-off, Modric flipped an insouciant pass forward towards Perisic, who cut inside Meunier on the edge of the area and whistled the bouncing ball just wide.   Updated at 3.57pm GMT    3.01pm    1 min Peep peep! Croatia kick off from left to right as we watch.     3.00pm    There has been so much talk about Belgium that we\u2019ve almost forgotten that this is an equally vital game for Croatia. If they lose and Morocco avoid defeat against Canada, they\u2019re out.     2.58pm    \u201cThe 2014-2022 iteration of Belgium hasn\u2019t underachieved,\u201d writes P\u00e1draig McAuliffe. \u201cIt played some great attacking football in World Cup 2014, and got knocked out by finalists Argentina in a squeaker. In 2016, they got done by Wales and that was a gross-underachievement. They were by far the most entertaining team at World Cup 2018, and lost a squeaker to the winners in the semis. \u201cThey beat Denmark, Portugal and Russia in Euro 2021 before losing to the overall winners in the tournament\u2019s best game. I\u2019ve really enjoyed watching this flawed-but-fun team down the years - Naingolan, de Bruyne, Carrasco-as-full-back, Hazard, Lukaku, Mertens and a range of ball-playing centre-halves. Wonderful.\u201d Yes, the Wales game is the only time you could really say they blew it, and even that\u2019s a bit disrespectful to Hal Robson-Kanu.     2.58pm    Apologies for the radio silence, I had an intestinal emergency. All is fine now and I\u2019m back just in time for the anthems. Let\u2019s play!   Updated at 3.02pm GMT    2.34pm    Sign up for our rebranded daily football email, Football Daily!      2.27pm    Belgium\u2019s tactics (II) Guillaume Pirard writes to say the Belgian media think Roberto Martinez will play a 3-4-3 \u2013 but with Kevin De Bruyne alongside Axel Witsel in midfield. He doesn\u2019t often play in a midfield two. Then again, these are desperate times for Belgium. Belgium (possible 3-4-3) Courtois; Alderweireld, Dendoncker, Vertonghen; Meunier, De Bruyne, Witsel, Castagne; Trossard, Mertens, Carrasco.     2.24pm    Belgium haven\u2019t underachieved: discuss.      2.09pm    Belgium\u2019s tactics Wait, hang on. There are some suggestions that Belgium will revert to a back three, but with Timothy Castagne rather than Leander Dendoncker in the defence. Belgium (possible 3-4-3) Courtois; Alderweireld, Vertonghen, Castagne; Meunier, Dendoncker, Witsel, Carrasco; De Bruyne, Mertens, Trossard.   Updated at 2.32pm GMT    2.06pm    Canada v Morocco This game is inextricably linked with events at the Al Thumama Stadium in Doha. You can follow that one with Our Baz.      2.05pm    \u201cFollowing the release of the line-ups, is the Bobby Martinez\u2019s \u2018Please, please give me a pay-off\u2019 plea?\u201d asks Ryan Grimward. I quite like the team he\u2019s picked. Eden Hazard is a shadow of the player who was in the Team of the Tournament at the last World Cup, and Trossard\u2019s selection is overdue.   Updated at 2.31pm GMT    1.54pm   Team news: Eden Hazard dropped  Croatia are unchanged; Belgium are not. Roberto Martinez has made four changes to the side that lost to Morocco on Sunday. The Hazard brothers and Michy Batshuayi are dropped; Amadou Onana is suspended. In come Dries Mertens, Yannick Carrasco, Leander Dendoncker and Brighton\u2019s Leandro Trossard. Kevin De Bruyne replaces Eden Hazard as captain.  The inclusion of Dendoncker means Belgium could line up with a back three or a back four. I suspect it\u2019s 4-2-3-1 with Dries Mertens as a false nine, but as Roberto Martinez won\u2019t answer my DMs, I can\u2019t speak with any authority. Croatia (4-3-3) Livakovic; Juranovic, Lovren, Gvardiol, Sosa; Modric, Brozovic, Kovacic; Kramaric, Livaja, Perisic.Substitutes: Grbic, Ivusic, Stanisic, Erlic, Majer, Vlasic, Pasalic, Petkovic, Budimir, Orsic, Vida, Sutalo, Sucic, Jakic. Belgium (possible 4-2-3-1) Courtois; Meunier, Alderweireld, Vertonghen, Castagne; Dendoncker, Witsel; Carrasco, De Bruyne, Trossard; Mertens.Substitutes: Mignolet, Casteels, Theate, Faes, Tielemans, Lukaku, Batshuayi, T Hazard, E Hazard, Doku, Vanaken, De Ketelaere, Openda, Debast.  Updated at 2.32pm GMT    1.30pm   The story so far  Croatia drew 0-0 with Morocco and then put Canada over their knee, coming from behind to win 4-1. Belgium followed a slightly unconvincing 1-0 win over Canada with an exceedingly unconvincing 2-0 defeat to Morocco on Sunday, after which the players reportedly had a row over which of them was farthest down the hill. I say \u2018reportedly\u2019, because Roberto Martinez has borrowed Donald Trump\u2019s favourite phrase, and I don\u2019t mean Make Belgium Great Again.      1.30pm   Permutations corner  This has been culled unashamedly from Martin Belam\u2019s excellent guide, which is linked below. Also, if it\u2019s wrong, blame him*. Croatia A draw is enough for Croatia to qualify. They may still qualify if they lose, if Canada beat Morocco, depending on the margins of the respective victories. Belgium Belgium need to win to be assured qualification. A draw may be enough, but only if Canada beat Morocco, and even then it will come down to goal difference. * It\u2019s not      1.30pm   Preamble  The problem with a golden generation is that one day it turns into base metal. In a few hours\u2019 time, either Croatia or Belgium \u2013 both on the podium at the last World Cup \u2013 will be lamenting the end of an era. Barring a defeat for Morocco against Canada, one of these two teams will be going home. Belgium are the most imperilled. They need to win to be sure of qualifying for the last 16, whereas a draw is enough for Croatia. There is a way Belgium could go through with a draw, or Croatia with a defeat, but we\u2019ll come to that in permutations corner. These are two of the oldest teams in the competition, and some of these legendary footballers are about to appear in a World Cup game for the final time: Kevin De Bruyne, Luka Modric, Romelu Lukaku, Ivan Perisic, Eden Hazard, Marcelo Brozovic, Toby Alderweireld, Dejan Lovren. And yet. While one of these teams will almost certainly be apologising earnestly to the nation after the final whistle, if either of them top the group they have the chance to go a long way in the tournament. The winners of Group F shouldn\u2019t meet Brazil, Spain, France, Argentina or England \u2013 the five favourites for the tournament - until at least the semi-final stage. Two golden generations duking it out, with everything at stake. As final group games go, this is a humglistener. Kick off 3pm GMT, 6pm in Al Rayyan, 4pm in Brussels and Zagreb.  "

                    "body": "The next month promises to be a busy time for Jude Bellingham watchers. After reminding everyone of why he\u2019s one of the most sought-after midfielders in the world with his performances for England in Qatar, he looks likely to be the subject of unprecedented levels of tittle-tattle this winter. According to AS in Spain, the Borussia Dortmund hierarchy have called an imminent meeting with Bellingham to discuss his future. He is expected to express his desire for a transfer at the end of the season, with Real Madrid, Liverpool, Chelsea, Manchester City and no doubt pretty much every other club in Europe keen on signing him.  Dortmund want more than \u00a3120m for Bellingham all in, however, which puts him out of many clubs\u2019 reach. Given the competition for his signature, Liverpool have run the rule over alternative options, including Matheus Nunes. Despite Nunes\u2019s slow start to life at Wolves, J\u00fcrgen Klopp is still interested in a player he was close to signing last summer. Pep Guardiola called the 24-year-old \u201cone of the best players in the world\u201d after Manchester City faced his then club Sporting in the Champions League last term, so he must be worth a punt. Harry Maguire and Scott McTominay have been given a reprieve at Manchester United despite limited game time recently because Erik ten Hag wants to keep them as cover. Having admitted that United need to improve their attacking options this month, Ten Hag continues to be linked with a move for Atl\u00e9tico Madrid\u2019s Jo\u00e3o F\u00e9lix. He could cost \u00a318.6m just to bring in on loan, though, which could prove to be a proverbial stumbling block. At the other end of the table, Nottingham Forest appear to be ready to move Emmanuel Dennis on. One of 22 signings brought in last summer, he has underwhelmed with one goal in all competitions. There could be a sticking point in that having played for Watford and Forest this season he can only sign for a club overseas or return to Vicarage Road. Forest are also open to offers for Harry Arter, Lo\u00efc Mbe Soh, Caf\u00fa and Lyle Taylor. Chelsea find themselves deep in negotiations over the structure of a potential \u00a3112m deal for Enzo Fern\u00e1ndez, a standout performer at the World Cup with Argentina. While Chelsea are keen to pay the fee in three annual instalments, Benfica aren\u2019t entirely convinced. If negotiations for Fern\u00e1ndez fall through, Graham Potter has his eye on Alexis Mac Allister, a player he knows well from their time together at Brighton, and Edson \u00c1lvarez, who has excelled at Ajax in recent seasons. Chelsea are also close to completing a move for Andrey Santos, Vasco da Gama\u2019s 18-year-old midfielder. He was previously linked with Liverpool, but such are the twists and turns of the transfer window."

                    "body": "If France are the new West Germany \u2013 unflinching under pressure, unconcerned with claiming neutral hearts \u2013 then perhaps time has spun back to 1986. If so then it is good news for Argentina. It has been 36 years since the South Americans edged past the West Germans in a thrilling final and, by the time this most unsettling of World Cups comes to an end at the Lusail Stadium, most football romantics will hope that Lionel Messi has finally claimed his place alongside Diego Maradona in Argentinian folklore.\nDestiny awaits. Messi in 2022 has been the equivalent of Maradona at Mexico 86, making an ordinary team believe they are capable of winning the greatest prize of all. This is surely his time. Unless, of course, France overcome the virus sweeping through their camp and pull off their latest heist. \u201cI know that Argentinian people, many people around the world, maybe even some French people hope Messi will win the World Cup,\u201d Didier Deschamps acknowledged. \u201cBut we will do everything to achieve our objective.\u201d\nThe message from Deschamps was that France are as ready as any flu-ridden team can be. \u201cWe know what Lionel Messi means in the history of football,\u201d France\u2019s captain, Hugo Lloris, added. \u201cBut we will try to find the key to success.\u201d\n\nAs Lloris pointed out this is a clash between two big nations. In the brief moments when the focus drifts from Messi and Kylian Mbapp\u00e9, France\u2019s bullet train of a forward, the attention falls on two sides whose realism has given both hope of adding a third star to their badge.\nBoth show how pragmatism has become the dominant force in international football. Four years ago Deschamps, whose restrained approach has attracted criticism, led France to glory with counterpunching football. Right now he is winning the argument. Even defeat at the final hurdle would be a victory of sorts given that Argentina\u2019s coach, Lionel Scaloni, has hardly sent his team out to play fantasy football. \u201cA very well organised side,\u201d was Lloris\u2019s verdict on Argentina. \u201cThey are strong defensively and have a very aggressive press on whoever has the ball. They are very good on the break.\u201d\n\nOn that note it was interesting to hear Ars\u00e8ne Wenger and J\u00fcrgen Klinsmann deliver their findings from the tournament at a Fifa technical briefing. Compactness in the central areas has been \u201cthe dominant way to play and defend\u201d. It has forced teams into the wide areas, which has led to 45 goals from crosses (up from 24 in 2018) and underlined the renewed importance of the traditional No 9. Think Antoine Griezmann\u2019s whipped delivery for Olivier Giroud to head home the winner during France\u2019s quarter-final win over England. Think Messi wriggling down the outside against Croatia, beating Josko Gvardiol and pulling the ball back for Juli\u00e1n \u00c1lvarez to score.\nThat was an example of the beauty of having forwards who can dribble past defenders. \u201cYou had a lot of teams with a lot of possession but no result,\u201d Wenger said, no doubt thinking of Spain. It was also pointed out that, with defensive lines pushing slightly higher, there have been a lot of balls over the top. France, with the pace of Mbapp\u00e9 and Ousmane Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 on the wings, threaten in that way.\nBut France do not set the pulse racing. They had 43% possession against England and 37% during their semi-final against Morocco. \u201cIn the second half we dropped back too much but that was also due to a good performance by the Moroccans,\u201d Lloris said. Good, but not enough. France are survivors. They ration their periods of dominance and maintain their shape when in front. Sometimes, though, it resembles a high-wire act. Morocco hit the post after going behind. England were a Harry Kane penalty away from making it 2-2.\n\nBut it works for the world champions. Away from Mbapp\u00e9, Giroud has performed selflessly in the absence of the injured Karim Benzema. Griezmann, excelling in his new role as an elusive No 10, a worthy contender for player of the tournament. Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 has been disciplined on the right. In midfield Aur\u00e9lien Tchouam\u00e9ni and Adrien Rabiot could have important jobs shutting down Messi\u2019s space. Rapha\u00ebl Varane, accompanied by either Ibrahima Konat\u00e9 or Dayot Upamecano, exudes calm in central defence.\nThis is a gnarly side, summed up by the possibility of Lloris becoming the first captain to win two World Cups. Only France could survive losing Benzema, Lucas Hernandez, Paul Pogba, N\u2019Golo Kant\u00e9, Presnel Kimpembe and Christopher Nkunku to injury and still make it this far. Even now, with illness disrupting their preparations, they will back themselves to beat Argentina.\nNot that it will be straightforward. Argentina, who were outplayed by France in the last 16 in Russia, are a shapeshifting proposition under Scaloni. They surprised the Netherlands with a back five in the quarter-finals, have quality attackers such as Paulo Dybala, \u00c1ngel Di Mar\u00eda and Lautaro Mart\u00ednez in reserve and have treated every game as a final since losing their opener to Saudi Arabia.\n\nArgentinian fervour is growing. They will command most of the support inside the Lusail. If it is to be a compact and energetic midfield four of Rodrigo De Paul, Enzo Fern\u00e1ndez, Alexis Mac Allister and Leandro Paredes they will look to outnumber France. Cristian Romero and Nicol\u00e1s Otamendi are warriors at the back.\nLike Giroud, \u00c1lvarez has emerged from the shadows to impress up front. There is more to the Manchester City forward than goals, even though he has four of them. \u00c1lvarez\u2019s movement and willingness to run in behind defences has also lightened the physical load on Messi, who has made the most of running less by scoring five goals and making three. Everything is geared towards keeping Messi happy. It will be a worry for Deschamps if the little genius works out ways to expose France\u2019s attack-minded left-back, Theo Hernandez.\n\u201cArgentina are a strong team with a young generation,\u201d Lloris said. \u201cThey are all dedicated to Leo Messi.\u201d But there was no waving of the white flag from France. They have Mbapp\u00e9, who has five goals and the chance to the become the owner of two winners\u2019 medals at the age of 23. They have an unshakeable team spirit and were boosted by Kingsley Coman, Theo Hernandez, Varane, Konat\u00e9 and Tchouam\u00e9ni returning to training last night.\n\u201cIt is going to be a tremendous occasion,\u201d Lloris continued. He was giving it the big sell. Argentina hope history is about to be made. France refuse to be swept away by sentiment. They believe they can deny Messi his romantic ending."

Fifa officials assured the AJFSF that a World Cup was \u201con the table\u201d, the Guardian understands. Fifa had committed to launching a \u201cwomen\u2019s futsal competition\u201d as part of its first strategy for women\u2019s football in 2018.\n\n\u201cWe need a real commitment once and for all,\u201d says the players\u2019 video statement, released on Wednesday. \u201cGender equality will not be achieved with empty promises. If they [Fifa] didn\u2019t want to listen to us before \u2026 they will see us now.\u201d\nTen of the world\u2019s best female players appear in the footage. \u201cYear after year they promise us a World Cup,\u201d says Italy\u2019s captain, Ersilia D\u2019Incecco. \u201cEquality can\u2019t be a promise,\u201d adds Argentina\u2019s Julia Paz Dupuy. They are joined by Amandinha, the Brazilian seven-times winner of best player in the world award \u2013 organised by the independent futsal planet website, not Fifa. The other leading players include Spain\u2019s double Uefa Euros-winning captain, Anita Luj\u00e1n, Iran\u2019s goalkeeper Zahra Lotfabadi, Portugal\u2019s Janice da Silva, Uruguay\u2019s F\u00e1tima Villar, Nancy Loth from the Netherlands, Chikage Kichibayashi from Japan, and Ukraine\u2019s Vika Kyslova.\n\u201cWe\u2019re really disappointed,\u201d said Natalia Orive, president of the AJFSF, which was formed in 2010 to represent players in Spain and relaunched last week as a global voice. She told the Guardian women\u2019s futsal was suffering from \u201cdouble discrimination\u201d within Fifa, losing out to men\u2019s futsal and women\u2019s 11-a-side.\n\u201cFifa has a strategy for women\u2019s football, gender equality and inclusion,\u201d said Orive. \u201cIf they\u2019re investing in women playing football, a percentage of that money should go towards futsal because we are also women and we have the right to play and opportunities to develop. The way that all women have felt abandoned inside these [Fifa] committees for many years, now they\u2019re doing the same with us futsal women.\n\u201cWe\u2019re not trying to compete with football. We just want our own space to develop. It\u2019s not right. It\u2019s not fair. What are we waiting for?\u201d\nAnita Luj\u00e1n, the veteran Spain captain and record caps holder, told the Guardian she felt \u201cangry, frustrated and disappointed\u201d at Fifa\u2019s approach. \u201cI wish I had the answer to why our World Cup and our sport is not important to Fifa,\u201d she said. \u201cBeing futsal, I think we are always in the shade of everything. And being a female futsal player it\u2019s even worse.\u201d\n\nThe indoor five-a-side sport, born in South America in the 1930s, is recognised as essential to the development of skill and game intelligence at youth level in Spain and other nations such as Brazil, Portugal, Russia and Iran, where it is the dominant game in schools and a professional sport.\nFifa took control of the sport in the 1980s after ousting the South America-based International Futsal Federation (Fifusa). A successor organisation to Fifusa, the Asociaci\u00f3n Mundial de Futsal, runs rival competitions but is dwarfed by the Fifa game.\nA Fifa spokesperson declined to comment on the accusation of \u201cdouble discrimination\u201d but confirmed that a World Cup was under consideration. \u201cFifa is still undergoing its consultation with confederations and stakeholders on the concept of a women\u2019s futsal World Cup within an overarching strategic approach to women\u2019s football,\u201d the spokesperson said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a big, important step \u2026 there is no definitive timeline for a decision, but rather, a commitment to an elaborate consultation process.\u201d\nUefa introduced a women\u2019s Euros in 2019."

                    "body": "1) Guardiola has some thinking to do For Pep Guardiola the World Cup may have arrived at an apposite moment. Manchester City could have beaten Brentford at the weekend but they lost, something they narrowly avoided when finding a way to beat Brighton, Leicester and Fulham in their previous Premier League outings. A six-week break for Qatar allows the manager to examine the team forensically and understand what is required to refresh a mode of play that is lacking the usual relentless pass-and-move sequences. \u201cPeople go to their national team, they will be focused, it is a dream for them, it\u2019s a World Cup. [The staff] have time to reflect: what we are doing well, what we could do better. After the first [league] game back \u2013 we will see,\u201d said Guardiola. \u201cThe Premier League is difficult but we are going to try to come back good and fight for that.\u201d Jamie Jackson  Match report: Man City 1-2 Brentford  2) United\u2019s old boys prove their worth Three vital points for Manchester United were won in thrillingly unconvincing fashion, with a starting XI that looked promising on paper providing as many questions as answers. An ostensibly riveting front three of Marcus Rashford, Anthony Elanga and Anthony Martial amounted to notably less than the sum of its parts, while a high-pedigree midfield trio was kept at arm\u2019s length by the superb Jo\u00e3o Palhinha. United\u2019s win was secured by a fearless young talent but over the course of the game it was less glamorous senior figures who gave United a platform for the win. Luke Shaw put in an industrious shift from left-back, covering the flank on his own and sparking numerous attacks with assured passing and clipped early crosses. Next to him, Victor Lindel\u00f6f stood firm when the visitors were firmly under the cosh at 1-1, repelling balls in the air and on the ground with zero margin for error. Much has been made of the need for a mass-clearout at Old Trafford \u2013 but not all the unfashionable old guard need to face the purge. Alex Hess  Match report: Fulham 1-2 Manchester United   3) Willock the best of Newcastle\u2019s in-form starlets If Joe Willock keeps playing like this, Gareth Southgate \u2013 or his successor \u2013 will surely offer the Newcastle midfielder a senior international cap. Willock not only scored a sublime winner against Chelsea on Saturday evening but thoroughly eclipsed the Qatar-bound Mason Mount and Conor Gallagher, dominating his first-half duel with the latter before Gallagher\u2019s relocation to right wing-back. As Eddie Howe\u2019s side registered a sixth straight victory, Chelsea lost a third successive Premier League game for the first time since Jos\u00e9 Mourinho\u2019s tenure seven years ago. While the Londoners looked enervated, Newcastle proved a study in streetwise efficiency, keeping a fourth clean sheet in six league games. That has much to do with not only Nick Pope\u2019s exceptional goalkeeping but Sven Botman\u2019s excellence at centre-half, Dan Burn\u2019s intelligent interpretation of an unfamiliar left-back role and Howe\u2019s exceptional coaching. Louise Taylor  Match report: Newcastle 1-0 Chelsea  4) Arsenal reaping the benefits of squad unity There was a moment in second-half stoppage time at Molineux on Saturday when, with the game long won and Wolves in a harmless position, three Arsenal players set about harrying Nathan Collins from different directions. On the sidelines, Mikel Arteta encouraged the press, and not for the first time. It was a snapshot of a team in a really good place. Arteta has said he will use the World Cup break to reflect on the strides his side have made but the togetherness in the table-topping squad seems priceless. \u201cI think everyone can see the spirit of the team and the way we love each other,\u201d Gabriel Jesus said. \u201cThe way we want to help each other on the pitch. That is what happens when you are in another family. We spend more time here [with Arsenal] than home. That is why it is working outside.\u201d Ben Fisher  Match report: Wolves 0-2 Arsenal  5) Fearsome N\u00fa\u00f1ez is finding his feet It has been an awkward start for Darwin N\u00fa\u00f1ez and Liverpool to say the least but as he signed off with a brace, a rampant display and a standing ovation against Southampton, the Uruguay international offered further evidence of why J\u00fcrgen Klopp expects his team to be more like their former selves after the World Cup. The 23-year-old, signed for an initial \u00a364m in the summer from Benfica, now has an impressive nine goals in 18 appearances for his new club. His understanding with Andy Robertson down the left and awareness of what those around him expect, encapsulated by a delightful backheel to set up Roberto Firmino following a superb move, also demonstrated how things are falling into place for N\u00fa\u00f1ez at Liverpool. \u201cHe has all the qualities for a modern-day striker,\u201d said Virgil van Dijk. \u201cThere is a reason why we bought him and he\u2019s maturing, he\u2019s stayed patient, kept his head down, and that\u2019s a credit to him. It is a new team, new environment, new country, new language so it is absolutely normal to take a little bit more time but there is no doubt the qualities are there and the goals will follow.\u201d Andy Hunter  Match report: Liverpool 3-1 Southampton  6) Kulusevski has made himself Conte\u2019s key man Dejan Kulusevski is not a flashy player but that does not matter one bit. He is devastatingly effective and if Tottenham had not been deprived of him since mid-September perhaps they would be putting more pressure on second-placed Manchester City, if not Arsenal. The Swedish forward is strong, quick, crisp, full of energy, carries the ball dynamically and makes exceptional decisions: it is some package for a 22-year-old and it says plenty that, in such a broken-up season, his clever assist for Rodrigo Bentancur\u2019s winner against Leeds was his fifth of the campaign. He was on song from the start against Jesse Marsch\u2019s team and seemed to get even stronger as the game continued; angst over the availability of Son Heung-min and Harry Kane is nothing new at Spurs but there is a strong argument that Kulusevski should not be considered any less important. Nick Ames  Match report: Tottenham 4-3 Leeds Utd   7) Listless Lampard is running out of time It\u2019s not easy to come up with reasons as to why Frank Lampard should remain manager of Everton \u2026 but then it wasn\u2019t easy to come up with reasons as to why Lampard should have been appointed as manager of Everton. So perhaps the board, who decided he was the man for the job then allowed him to splurge not far off \u00a3100m in transfer fees \u2013 never mind wages \u2013 will stick with him. They may rationalise that he kept them up last season, but the reality is that he took over in January so was partially responsible for their surprise presence in a relegation battle, and the wild atmosphere in which the players saved themselves was created by the club\u2019s support. Lampard can claim as a triumph the central-midfield redeployment of Alex Iwobi \u2013 probably the least dreadful Everton player at Bournemouth. But it is far from enough, and there is zero evidence to suggest Lampard has the chops to tidy his mess. Daniel Harris  Match report: Bournemouth 3-0 Everton  8) Brilliant Barnes lights up east London The attention was inevitably on James Maddison, who gave England a brief injury scare when he hobbled off at the London Stadium, but he was not the only bright young attacker who caught the eye during Leicester\u2019s win over West Ham. Harvey Barnes had a big part to play in Maddison\u2019s early goal, running away from Thilo Kehrer before combining with Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall and Patson Daka, and he finished West Ham by scoring his side\u2019s second with 12 minutes left. It was a clinical finish from Barnes, who has four goals in his last six games. He appears to be over his injury problems. Tricky, speedy and direct, Barnes is looking sharp. He is not going to the World Cup, but his current form is a reminder of why Gareth Southgate had him in the England squad two years ago. If he keeps it up Barnes could yet be playing alongside Maddison for England. Jacob Steinberg  Match report: West Ham 0-2 Leicester  9) Emery provides new manager bounce off the bench Six points (albeit alongside a disappointing cup exit) in his opening fortnight suggest Unai Emery\u2019s initial impressions of his Aston Villa squad have been spot on. And while Sunday\u2019s victory at Brighton was very different to their win against Manchester United seven days prior, Emery\u2019s game management was equally impressive. Five second-half changes at the Amex were all designed to frustrate Brighton and allow his side to absorb pressure. Emery has used all 15 of the substitutions available to him so far. Whereas his predecessor hesitated to make alterations, the Spaniard has done so swiftly. Emery will now use the break to study his squad\u2019s strengths. He probably ought not say it aloud, but the fact that so few are heading to Qatar may just be a blessing. Sam Dalling  Match report: Brighton 1-2 Aston Villa  10) Is Cooper\u2019s plan finally coming together? You probably won\u2019t be aware of this, but last summer Nottingham Forest made 22 signings! I know! For a while, it looked like Steve Cooper was lost in the larder, unsure of who to use or when to use them. After the dispiriting defeat to Wolves, Forest were bottom of the table with five points from 10 games, but they drew two and won two of their next five, then in midweek they comprehensively ejected Spurs from the League Cup. If you add that many to your squad, the law of averages says that some of them have to be good, and for Forest it looks like Morgan Gibbs-White and Jesse Lingard might be the difference-makers. There\u2019s plenty of work still to be done, but there\u2019s nothing more important in football than the ability to score. Lingard, whose commitment was being questioned only recently, certainly has that, while Gibbs-White just might be in the process of adding the numbers that elevate him from talent into player.

                    "body": "\u201cI thought I was in Bali, I\u2019d been kidnapped, drugged and people had stolen all my stuff because I couldn\u2019t find anything,\u201d says Ryan Campbell. In reality, the former Australia wicketkeeper was in a Stoke hospital and awake after a week spent in a coma. On a family visit to England last April, Campbell had been playing with his two young children in a Cheshire playground when he suffered a cardiac arrest. Another parent present came to his aid before Campbell was treated at Royal Stoke University Hospital. For the recently turned 50-year-old, the events formed part of a \u201cseven-day window of nothing\u201d, his memory only going as far as getting on the flight he took from Schiphol airport to arrive in the country. His friends and family can remember, and it\u2019s their experiences he reflects on.  \u201cIt\u2019s horrific what they had to endure,\u201d says Campbell. \u201cI\u2019ve read articles where my wife and a great friend of mine, Simon Millington, spoke about their time sitting by my bed and what they went through. That\u2019s the moments where you go: \u2018Jeez, I\u2019m a lucky man.\u2019\u201d A near-death experience still offers space for a light touch. \u201cI can\u2019t confess that I\u2019m a religious man, but I kind of thought someone was looking over my shoulder at some point. He obviously didn\u2019t want to catch up with me upstairs because I never saw any lights or any white tunnels.\u201d Fortunately, even through a Zoom screen, Campbell is looking in good nick: healthy, smiling and happy to squeeze in a chat between all the other tasks that occupy him as Durham\u2019s new head coach. It\u2019s another country ticked off in a career that\u2019s moved through multiple continents. A swashbuckling keeper-batter for Western Australia at the turn of the century, Campbell won two Sheffield Shield titles and a couple of ODI caps too. He only caught the early days of T20 cricket but was playing the scoop shot in the one-day game long before it became a modern staple. \u201cBack in those days the game was very simple. At the death, you needed to bowl yorkers. You would have fine-leg up, mid-on, mid-off back. I\u2019m thinking, I know where everything\u2019s going, surely if I get down and get it on the full, I can just nip it over my shoulder and it\u2019s away. \u201cThat was the theory behind it, of course I needed the courage to do it in a game. It\u2019s a bit of a joke now but [Victoria\u2019s] Darren Berry was the wicketkeeper, up to the stumps. And I thought: \u2018Right, I don\u2019t like you very much.\u2019 I joke with Darren nowadays about it, but I tried to pretty much hit him in the face but kept missing him and it kept going for four. I thought to myself: \u2018Gee, I\u2019m on to something here.\u2019\u201d Coaching would take Campbell to Hong Kong where he made an unlikely return to international cricket in his forties, playing for his adopted home at the 2016 World T20. He then went on to coach the Netherlands, eventually signing off as a consultant at last year\u2019s men\u2019s T20 World Cup, his final act including an upset over South Africa. \u201cI know in sport you\u2019re not supposed to have fairytale finishes, but that was totally it.\u201d And now to Durham, where Campbell\u2019s job is to lift a side that finished third-bottom in Division Two last year and had a torrid time with the white ball. Yet there\u2019s still some decent pedigree in these parts. \u201cMy first week in, I\u2019m walking in and suddenly I\u2019m throwing balls to Ben Stokes and that just takes you to another level. As Aussies, it\u2019s drummed into us from the start on how to beat England. But we also have drummed into us a great respect for the county game.\u201d  Having already worked with England\u2019s Test captain, will he try to replicate the national side\u2019s new approach? \u201cI\u2019m not here to replicate anything, because they\u2019re on a different level. They\u2019ve taken it to a whole different way of playing. The one thing I will say \u2013 I don\u2019t want to sound like I\u2019m jumping on anyone\u2019s wagon \u2013 but that was the way I was taught to play the game. Rod Marsh was my academy coach and the first thing he said to me was: \u2018You as a batter have to be an entertainer, and your job is to give the bowlers enough time to take 20 wickets to win a game of cricket. So hurry up and get on with it.\u2019 \u201cEngland have got two very positive people in charge in Ben and [Brendon] McCullum, and it\u2019s exciting to see what they\u2019re going to do with it. I can\u2019t wait to see what\u2019s going to happen in the Ashes. For the first time in a long time, I don\u2019t think I can pick a winner. And I think that\u2019s where it\u2019s exciting, because Australian cricket are going to sit there and say: \u2018They can\u2019t do that to our bowlers.\u2019 England\u2019s going to sit there and go: \u2018Oh, yes, we can. We\u2019re going to go and we\u2019re going to meet them head-on.\u2019\u201d While he won\u2019t copy Stokes\u2019s homework, Campbell\u2019s view on how he wants his side to play does sound familiar. \u201cDon\u2019t have any fear and go for it. We\u2019ve got nothing to lose, we\u2019re here to win games of cricket, not just to draw and not just to survive.\u201d It\u2019s a style that sees things as they are; that this is all a game. That\u2019s not to say it doesn\u2019t matter, particularly after what Campbell experienced last year. \u201cOne thing that\u2019s become very clear to me after what I\u2019ve been through is, I love this game. I love everything about it. \u201cIf you\u2019re a part of it, you should enjoy it. It\u2019s going to be tough. It\u2019s going to break your heart sometimes, but I think we need to enjoy it for what it is. It\u2019s a wonderful game to be a part of.\u201d  This is an extract from the Guardian\u2019s weekly cricket email, The Spin. To subscribe, just visit this page and follow the instructions. "

                    "body": "Good morning. Pel\u00e9, the Brazilian virtuoso whose captivating skill and athleticism ensured he was universally regarded as one of football\u2019s greatest players, has died at the age of 82. Pel\u00e9, who had a colon tumour removed in 2021, was readmitted to Albert Einstein hospital in S\u00e3o Paulo in November due to deteriorating health. A hospital statement yesterday confirmed the death of \u201cour dear King of Football\u201d at 3.27pm local time, \u201cdue to the failure of multiple organs, a result of the progression of cancer of the colon associated with his previous clinical condition\u201d. A statement from Pel\u00e9\u2019s official Instagram page said: \u201cInspiration and love marked the journey of King Pel\u00e9, who peacefully passed away today. On his journey, Edson enchanted the world with his genius in sport, stopped a war, carried out social works all over the world and spread what he most believed to be the cure for all our problems: love. \u201cHis message today becomes a legacy for future generations. Love, love and love, for ever.\u201d  \u2018A golden glow\u2019. Pel\u00e9 radiated a simpler special quality than the handful of footballers generally thought of as his peers \u2013 and one which made a more instant appeal to the eye and the heart: the quality of joy. \u2018A non-exportable national treasure\u2019. After 1970 he was probably the most famous man in world sport, with only Muhammad Ali as instantly recognisable and universally idolised.  FDA under fire for approval of Alzheimer\u2019s drug Aduhelm  US drug regulators failed to follow their own guidance and practices when they approved the controversial Alzheimer\u2019s drug Aduhelm, a congressional report said yesterday. The US Food and Drug Administration\u2019s (FDA) process of approval, it said, had been \u201crife with irregularities\u201d, and the FDA\u2019s interactions with maker Biogen had been \u201catypical\u201d. Biogen, the report found, had set an \u201cunjustifiably high\u201d price by initially pricing Aduhelm at $56,000 a year. The pricing was established despite a lack of demonstrated clinical benefit in a broad patient population. Aduhelm\u2019s authorization was based on evidence that it could reduce brain plaques \u2013 considered a probable contributor to Alzheimer\u2019s \u2013 but not on proof that it slowed the progression of the disease.  \u2018Corporate greed\u2019. The report \u201cdocuments the atypical FDA review process and corporate greed that preceded FDA\u2019s controversial decision to grant accelerated approval\u201d, said a statement from one senior Democratic congressman.  Andrew Tate: influencer detained in Romania on organised crime and rape charges  The controversial online influencer and self-described misogynist Andrew Tate has been detained in Romania on charges of human trafficking, rape and forming an organised crime group, authorities confirmed. The former kickboxer and reality TV star, who has been banned from a number of social media platforms for misogynistic comments and hate speech, was arrested alongside his brother and two other suspects. They would be detained for 24 hours, prosecutors from the anti organised-crime unit said in a statement after raiding their properties in Bucharest. The Tate brothers have been under criminal investigation since April. A spokesperson said they would cooperate with the Romanian authorities.  The charges. Prosecutors accuse them of \u201crecruiting, housing and exploiting women by forcing them to create pornographic content meant to be seen on specialized websites for a cost. They would have gained important sums of money.\u201d  New York\u2019s first legal dispensary for recreational marijuana opens doors  New York\u2019s first legal dispensary for recreational marijuana opened yesterday at 4.20pm. Housing Works Cannabis Company is rolling out retail adult-use weed sales at a shop in Lower Manhattan \u2013 a former Gap outpost. All proceeds from these pot purchases \u201cgo back to fund our services and advocacy, which include housing, healthcare, and people living with HIV and chronic illness\u201d, the creative director of the non-profit Housing Works, Elizabeth Koke, told reporters. New York City\u2019s mayor, Eric Adams, added: \u201cToday marks a major milestone in our efforts to create the most equitable cannabis industry in the nation. The opening \u2026 represents a new chapter for those most harmed by the failed policies of the past.\u201d The opening of Housing Works\u2019 4,400-square-foot weed shop comes after fits and starts in New York\u2019s cannabis industry. In 2019, possession of the psychoactive plant was largely decriminalized before legalization last year.  An equitable rollout. When state lawmakers greenlit legal, adult-use cannabis, they prioritized equity in determining license recipients and reserved many for applicants who had past marijuana-related convictions as well as some non-profits.

Don\u2019t miss this: Chuck D: \u2018Bringing rap to the UK was our British invasion\u2019  The founder of Public Enemy answers questions from Guardian readers on the future of hip-hop, police harassment and whether he has ever ridden on an ostrich. \u201cThe English language had taken over the world, so we thought: why not plug hip-hop into it? The British had beaten the English language into so many cultures; bringing rap music back to the UK was our British invasion.\u201d On why US hip-hop seldom explicitly address the political nature of African-American oppression in the US, he says: \u201cBecause the revolution can\u2019t be sold. It can\u2019t be marketed the way other music is marketed; it has to be given to the people. We had the blessing of right age, right place, right time. I was the right person with the right thing going on: Black music in New York.\u201d \u2026 or this: \u2018In 2022, I walked away from the greatest love of my life so far\u2019  \u201cLockdown, the scale of loss and the long tail of Covid-19 problems have left us with a more urgent understanding of how transient life really is,\u201d writes Moya Lothian-McLean. \u201cWants and needs came into sharp focus. Priorities changed \u2013 including the importance placed on long-term romantic love.\u201d This goes some way to explaining the headline of the piece. \u201cI believe objectively we had mileage left in our relationship. There were cracks, yes, but at other points in time, these may have been surmountable. Broadly, we were happy enough \u2013 but in 2022, that itself became a faultline for us.\u201d Climate check: UK study adds to evidence of air pollution link to long-term illness A new study, the largest of its kind, found that people living in polluted areas were more likely to have more than one long-term illness. Researchers found greater chances of multiple neurological, respiratory, cardiovascular and common mental health conditions such as depression and anxiety, even having allowed for differences in income. Dr Ioannis Bakolis, from King\u2019s College London, who led the study, said: \u201cIf air pollution exposure indeed affects risk, it presents an opportunity to shape the epidemic of multiple long-term illness using environmental policy such as expanding low-emission zones or avoiding building care homes in pollution hotspots.\u201d Last thing: France leading way in alcohol-free drinks boom  France is one of the fastest-growing markets in the global boom in alcohol-free drinks. The rush of startups creating alcohol-free spirits, wines, cocktails and beers marks a departure in a country with a vast alcohol industry and a president, Emmanuel Macron, who is so supportive of wine that he was voted person of the year by the nation\u2019s wine review, and hailed for saying: \u201cI drink wine every day, at lunchtime and in the evening.\u201d Karima Lounis, from the French no-alcohol brand JNPR, said the no-alcohol drive was also a no-sugar drive: \u201cPeople don\u2019t want sugar in their drinks, and they\u2019re surprised to learn we can create these drinks without sugar. I\u2019ve been surprised at end of year tastings by how many young people, between 19 and 30, want to stop drinking alcohol.\u201d Sign up  First Thing is delivered to thousands of inboxes every weekday.

Fans from around the world swapped memories of the player online on Saturday and debated his position in the pantheon of football icons.\nFor most of his career Pel\u00e9 was widely held to be the greatest player of all time, a status that was hotly contested with the arrival of Argentina\u2019s Diego Maradona in the 1980s. Recent performances by Argentina\u2019s Lionel Messi, most notably in securing his first World Cup title last weekend, have also elevated his status.\nPel\u00e9\u2019s fans, however, point to his three World Cup winner\u2019s medals in 1958, 1962 and 1970, the first of which he won as a 17-year-old by scoring six goals across the quarter-final, semi-final and final.\nHe then went on to make Brazil\u2019s Santos one of the greatest club sides that ever played, winning every title possible. He retired in 1974 but returned to play for the New York Cosmos in what was then the nascent North American soccer league.\nHis record of 1,281 goals in 1,363 games is still unsurpassed."

                    "body": "Leftwing Brazilians are hoping to use their country\u2019s first World Cup match to reclaim its well-known yellow and green football jersey from Jair Bolsonaro\u2019s far-right movement. The canarinho (little canary) shirt has become the most potent symbol of support for Brazil\u2019s nationalist leader, who won power in 2018 but had his hopes of a second term dashed last month after leftwing former president Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva won the presidential election. Lula, who will take power on 1 January, is spearheading efforts to wrest back control of the football shirt, as well as other Brazilian symbols such as the national anthem and flag.  The 77-year-old has announced that he will watch Thursday\u2019s match against Serbia wearing a canarinho with the number 13 \u2013 which represents his Workers\u2019 party (PT) \u2013 emblazoned on the back. Leftwing football fanatics can download the design from Lula\u2019s official website and make a shirt of their own. \u201cWe can\u2019t be ashamed of wearing our green and yellow shirt,\u201d Lula told reporters recently. \u201c[It] doesn\u2019t belong to one particular candidate. It doesn\u2019t belong to one particular party. Green and yellow are the colours of 213 million citizens who love this country.\u201d Marcelo Freixo, another prominent leftwing politician and football aficionado, said he would watch Brazil\u2019s Qatar debut wearing a yellow and green shirt paying tribute to his local team, Flamengo, as well as the storied Sele\u00e7\u00e3o. \u201cFascist movements have always expropriated national symbols, [but] \u2026 we won the election and it\u2019s now time to reclaim all of our national symbols, which belong to all of us,\u201d Freixo said. \u201cThe Brazilian flag, the Brazilian team and the national anthem have never belonged to the far right.\u201d  Reginaldo Lopes, a PT congressman and Lula ally, sported the canarinho during a recent interview with the Guardian \u2013 a look that would once have instantly marked him out as a Bolsonarista. \u201cIt\u2019s supposed to send the message that we are recovering democracy and that symbols such as our flag and our jersey belong to everyone, and not just to one political faction,\u201d said Lopes. \u201cIt\u2019s wrong for one \u2026 political faction to try and appropriate something which is a symbol for all Brazilians.\u201d Not all leftwing Brazilians are finding it easy to re-embrace a jersey that has come to represent an extremist president who devastated the Amazon and whose calamitous Covid response led to nearly 700,000 citizens dying. The reconciliation has been further complicated by the fact that several leading Brazil players \u2013 including star striker Neymar \u2013 are Bolsonaro backers. \u201cI\u2019m not ready to wear the shirt yet,\u201d said Priscila Motta, a 43-year-old publicist, as she dropped her son off at school on Thursday wearing Brazil\u2019s blue away shirt. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be confused with a Bolsonarista.\u201d Andr\u00e9 Porcaro, a 41-year-old engineer from the city of Eugen\u00f3polis, said he planned to pull on his yellow shirt for the first time since the 2018 World Cup on Thursday.  \u201cI think that today \u2013 specifically today \u2013 the yellow shirt isn\u2019t linked to politics. Today, if someone sees me wearing the shirt on the street, they won\u2019t automatically assume I\u2019m a Bolsominion,\u201d Porcaro said, using one of the derogatory names for followers of the outgoing president. But would Porcaro still be wearing yellow on Friday? \u201cI don\u2019t think so,\u201d he said. \u201cPerhaps I\u2019ll just wear it during the World Cup \u2026 I think it\u2019s almost impossible to dissociate the yellow shirt from this political movement.\u201d Freixo believed the time had come to mount a counterattack against Bolsonaro\u2019s authoritarian bid to kidnap the canarinho. \u201cWe must reclaim these symbols and democratise them,\u201d he said, as Brazil\u2019s players prepared to launch their quest for a sixth World Cup title."

                    "body": "In the final seconds of the 1958 World Cup final, with Brazil already 4-2 ahead, Pel\u00e9, then just 17 years old, received a long ball near the Swedish penalty area. He caught it on his chest, stunning it so smartly that the ball dropped at his feet. He stepped over the ball and effortlessly back-heeled it to a teammate. With the crowd still cheering this, the ball was lobbed back into the area and, insouciantly, Pel\u00e9 flicked it with the side of his head into the goal. Within moments, Brazil had won their first World Cup, making the nation\u2019s identity, then better known for coffee, synonymous with football. Pel\u00e9, reduced to floods of tears on the pitch, began his life as the embodiment of Brazilian football. It is worth recalling how much was riding on this moment for Brazil. The country\u2019s scintillating Afro-Brazilian stars, such as Le\u00f4nidas, first caught the world\u2019s attention at the 1938 World Cup. Commentators at the time suggested that the country\u2019s hybrid Afro-Indian-European demography was the greatest strength behind its football and culture. The 1950 World Cup, held in Brazil, was meant to cement this notion, but the shock defeat to Uruguay in the final game \u2013 the Maracanazo \u2013 was read as a failure of the country\u2019s modernisation and its pathological miscegenation; the black players were made scapegoats for the defeat and racist stereotypes were reactivated. In 1958 the curse was lifted. Brazil\u2019s super-diverse squad had become champions playing in their own unique style; Pel\u00e9 was the star, and the world took notice. He was, of course, a supremely talented athlete who would have shone in any age, but his career coincided with a golden age of Brazilian football \u2013 when the game really was the very centre of cultural life \u2013 and the explosive spread of television, which massively amplified his presence everywhere. Consequently, Pel\u00e9 was the first Brazilian footballer whose cultural impact exceeded the game, and football\u2019s first global celebrity. Two moments illustrate this.  First was Pel\u00e9\u2019s 1,000th goal, a marker concocted by the Brazilian media that in late 1969 turned into a gigantic circus, a made-for-TV spectacle that saw journalists and cameras track his every move as the milestone came into view. When he finally scored it, live on TV,the next day, in Brazil, it was considered just as important as the Apollo 12 moon landings. Second, the 1970 World Cup final, in which Pel\u00e9\u2019s Brazil beat Italy 4-1, is often thought to have been the finest performance by any team, ever. The gold standard \u2013 what Pel\u00e9 himself termed o jogo bonito, the beautiful game. Good as the game was, what fixed the moment in the global imagination was that it was the first World Cup final to be broadcast live across the world by satellite, and the first to be available in colour \u2013 Brazil\u2019s canary-yellow shirts, for the first time, were shown in all their chromatic glory, shimmering in the Mexican sun. TV aside, Pel\u00e9 was the first truly multimedia football star. He was celebrated in song by many of Brazil\u2019s leading popular musicians, from Jackson do Pandeiro to Chico Buarque. Brazil\u2019s most august poets, such as Jo\u00e3o Cabral Melo Neto, did likewise. For a time, he had his own radio show, he released a number of hit records, starred in telenovelas and was the subject of five film biographies. His own acting career, essentially playing Pel\u00e9, included the cult Escape to Victory and a turn as a private-eye-cum-social-worker in Os Trombadhinas. Before retiring from the game, Pel\u00e9 relaunched football in the United States during his five years at the New York Cosmos. In retirement he served briefly as President Fernando Henrique Cardoso\u2019s minister of sport, before settling into his metier \u2013 being Pel\u00e9. He was the first footballer to trademark his nickname and was the face of global brands, from Pepsi to Viagra, long before anyone else.  There will, no doubt, be much discussion as to whether he was the greatest and most celebrated football player of all time, or whether that crown, having already been lost to Argentina and Maradona in the 1980s, has now passed to Lionel Messi. Perhaps this is true. A player can only be as good as their historical moment allows. Compared to Pel\u00e9\u2019s era, players\u2019 levels of training, fitness and medical support are immeasurably higher. Equipment is lighter and better, boots are more like ballet shoes, nutrition is much improved. Either way, for all of Maradona\u2019s bombastic presence and Messi\u2019s brilliance in an era of unprecedented media globalisation, both followed paths that were first forged by Pel\u00e9.

                    "body": "In one village, dozens of houses have been painted white and blue. In another, vast 10-metre statues of football star Lionel Messi have been erected in rivers and along roadsides. But this is not Argentina proudly supporting their national team ahead of Sunday\u2019s World Cup final, where Argentina will face France, but instead is India\u2019s southernmost state of Kerala.  India, and the south Asia region, is known more for its love of cricket and the countries have never participated in major international football tournaments. But every four years, in corners of India and across Bangladesh, football fever comes alive with the arrival of the World Cup. Without their own national squads to support, fans instead have developed decades-long allegiances to other teams; none more so than an enduring love for Argentina, the team of football icons Messi and Maradona. MB Rajesh, a Kerala minister, told the Guardian his heart \u201ccarries the blue and white stripes\u201d. \u201cThat country and its football team symbolises the irresistible urge of humanity to liberate themselves from oppression,\u2019 said Rajesh. \u201cI relate to their fights with justice and survival.\u201d The football obsession in Indian states such as Kerala and West Bengal dates hundreds of years, to the times of British colonial rule when it was played among soldiers. Though it has never qualified for a World Cup, India is home to some of the oldest football clubs in the world. In Kerala, India\u2019s most leftwing state which has been ruled by a socialist government for decades, the widespread love of Argentina\u2019s national team was partly credited to the revolutionary legacy of the Latin American country, which has fierce support in the Indian state.  \u201cArgentina is the land of Messi and Che Guevara. Whether it wins or not in the final, I will continue to be a diehard fan,\u201d said TM Thomas Issac, an economist and member of Kerala\u2019s ruling Communist Party of India (Marxist). Ahead of Sunday\u2019s final, the state has descended into a blue-and-white frenzy, and public screenings, where thousands will attend, are being arranged by fans and local authorities. After a clash erupted between Argentina and Brazil fans during the beginning of the World Cup, police said they had beefed up security for Sunday. In Mallappuzhassery village, local Argentina fan S Abhijith collected donations so they could buy 3,000 Argentina football shirts to distribute for free ahead of the final, and decorate the area with blue and white streamers. \u201cFor us, this is the biggest celebration,\u201d he said. \u201cOur team will definitely win the cup.\u201d In football-obsessed Pullavoor village in Kerala\u2019s Kozhikode district, competing fans of Portugal, Brazil and Argentina had all installed cutouts of their favourite players in the middle of the local river at the beginning of the tournament. But as the others were knocked out, cutouts of Brazil\u2019s Neymar and Portugal\u2019s Ronaldo were removed; now only Messi remains.  Such was the dedication to the tournament for a group of 17 Argentina-supporting friends in Kerala\u2019s city of Kochi, they spent 2.3m rupees (\u00a322,807) to purchase a house specifically just to watch the World Cup together. Ahead of the final, the house has been decorated with Argentina flags and huge screens will be arranged so everyone can squeeze in. \u201cNow we can sit together and can see the World Cup together,\u201d PA Shefeer, who is one of the group who bought the house. \u201cAll our family members and friends will gather here to watch the final.\u201d A similar Argentina fever has gripped Kolkata, the capital city of India\u2019s state of West Bengal. The city has had a football club since 1872, the first in the country, and the World Cup is still widely followed. After Argentina qualified for the World Cup, the streets erupted in cheering and celebration. Vendors said they were now running out of Argentina football shirts to sell before the final and tea-sellers were giving out free chai to Argentina supporters.  Pragnan Saha, 17, is a member of Kolkata\u2019s Argentina football fanclub, which was established by his father Uttam Saha in 2002, who is such a huge fan he has travelled to Qatar in the hope of seeing Messi finally lift the World Cup. \u201cFor us diehard fans, watching every match of the Argentina national team fills us with great joy and excitement,\u201d said Saha.  Saha said it was because of Messi and Maradona that his family were so dedicated to the Argentina team. When Maradona visited Kolkata in 2008, they built an almost 10-metre  statue of the footballer and on Maradona\u2019s 50th birthday in 2010, they made a 1.67-metre (5.5ft) long cake, matching Maradona\u2019s height, and distributed it among the local community. For the World Cup this year, the Saha family and their Argentina fan club said they had \u201ctaken things up a notch\u201d and covered their whole neighbourhood in Argentina flags, colours and huge photos and cutouts of Messi and other members of the team as well as customising their car in blue and white. They have also set up a \u201cfan park\u201d where they and other football devotees have been watching all the matches. \u201cI am extremely excited about this match as I am sure that Lionel Messi-led Argentina is set to win the World Cup this time and prove to the world once and for all that he is the greatest of all time\u201d said Saha.  Just across the border in Bangladesh, where Argentina has a deep-rooted fan base, their qualification for the final was met with celebration across the country. Fans \u2013 many painted in Argentina\u2019s colours \u2013 poured on to the streets of Dhaka and other big cities, waving Argentina flags, loudly singing and dancing and hugging each other as they cheered Messi\u2019s name. The Argentina World Cup fever was so palpable that it even caught the attention of Argentina\u2019s national football team\u2019s official Twitter account, who recently tweeted at Bangladesh fans: \u201cThank you for supporting our team!! They are crazy like us!\u201d Tamjidul Hoque, 22, a law student in the Bangladeshi city of Chittagong and a fierce Argentina fan, said that Bangladesh\u2019s long-running love of Argentina dated back to the 1986 World Cup. It was the first World Cup that people in a newly developing Bangladesh could watch on colour televisions, and people were enraptured by the performance of Maradona, who led the triumph over teams such as England to lift the World Cup. \u201cThat won people over and Maradona became a massively iconic figure here in the 1980s,\u201d said Hoque.  The World Cup has recently enabled a bond to develop between Bangladesh and Argentina fans. After some in Argentina got wind of their fanbase in Bangladesh, they repaid the support by setting up a Facebook fan group for the Bangladesh national cricket team, which now has hundreds of Argentine members even though cricket is barely followed there. \u201cIt was incredible, it shows how football can unite people even though we are separated by thousands of miles,\u201d said Hoque. Hoque has been a lifelong fan of Argentina and recalls crying himself to sleep as a child in 2006 when they were knocked out of the World Cup. \u201cIt would be my dream to see Messi lift the World Cup at last,\u201d he said.

                    "body": "  9.17pm    That\u2019s all for today. Thanks for following along with us and be sure to check out the match report here.      9.07pm   Berhalter: \u2018In general, it\u2019s nervy times\u2019  \u201cI still think we\u2019re not as confident as I\u2019d like,\u201d Berhalter says. \u201cWe\u2019re playing tentative and you see the connections are just, they\u2019re not there like we\u2019d want. The effort was great today. The intensity was great, especially at the end of the game. We kept pushing, kept trying to score. I can\u2019t fault the effort, but we need to keep improving.\u201d He adds: \u201cI think in general, it\u2019s nervy times. People are worried about being on the roster or not, and it\u2019s a difficult moment. But having said that, we just need to go out and play together. Still the confidence isn\u2019t there yet, but we\u2019ll get there.\u201d Asked whether tonight answered any of his questions about the No 9 position, Berhalter says: \u201cIt was tough. Jesus [Ferreira] came on and got a couple chances. It was tough for Ricardo [Pepi]. He didn\u2019t get much service. He didn\u2019t get many chances. So it\u2019s really hard to evaluate players when they\u2019re not getting opportunities.\u201d What is his message to the guys in the locker room after their final tune-up before Qatar? \u201cThis camp is done and when we get to Qatar, you know, be at ease,\u201d he says. \u201cThis is the team. The team\u2019s not changing after that. We need to play our game. Play with confidence.\u201d     8.55pm   Full-time: Saudi Arabia 0-0 USA  Well, yikes seems appropriate. The United States have drawn Saudi Arabia in their final match before the Qatar World Cup. This one will do nothing to quiet the swirling concerns around Berhalter\u2019s side with the kickoff of their opening match against Wales all of 54 days and 22 hours from now.   Updated at 9.35pm BST    8.51pm    90 min+1: Adams fouls Alabid from behind and is shown yellow. Free kick forthcoming for Saudi Arabia ... and it\u2019s headed away by Zimmerman. The US try to counter but they\u2019re dispossessed and Almuwallad fires another shot from distance in the general vicinity of the American goal that sails over the crossbar.  Updated at 8.52pm BST    8.48pm    90 min: The fourth official signals for three added minutes.     8.48pm    88 min: Arriola hacks down Kanno but Saudi Arabia can\u2019t create anything out of the ensuing free kick in their attacking half.     8.47pm    86 min: Arriola\u2019s left-footed shot from the right side of the box misses the target.     8.44pm    82 min: Alabid tries a through ball to Asiri, but the flag goes up for offside.     8.43pm    81 min: Two more subs for Saudi Arabia: Altambakti in for Bahbir and Bamasaud in for Alghanam.     8.38pm    80 min: Saudi Arabia win their third corner. It\u2019s played short before an entry pass bounces out off Aaronson for a fourth. This time it\u2019s played into the six-yard box on a dangerous tack but Alamri can\u2019t convert it.     8.36pm    77 min: Almuwallad wins a free kick on a Zimmerman foul but nothing comes of it. Moments later, the US win a corner conceded by Alghanam. It\u2019s knocked down by the near post and Saudi Arabia break out into a counter.  Updated at 8.45pm BST    8.34pm    75 min: Tillman and Aaronson enter the game for McKennie and Pulisic. Tillman is playing out on the left side and Aaronson is playing closer toward the middle.     8.32pm    73 min: Alabid\u2019s left-footed shot from just outside the box misses the target. Brenden Aaronson and Malik Tillman appear to be coming on for the United States shortly.     8.30pm    70 min: A poor giveaway by McKenzie leads to a golden chance for Saudi Arabia. Asiri\u2019s well-struck attempt from outside the area is parried away by Turner, however. Yikes. A trio of subs for Saudi Arabia: Almuwallad, Kanoo and Alabid are on for Aldawsari, Alhassan and Alburaikan.  Updated at 8.40pm BST    8.24pm    65 min: The US win a corner and it\u2019s played deep to the far post. Zimmerman rises up but can\u2019t get a head on it and McKennie fails to keep it in, leading it a Saudi Arabia goal kick.     8.21pm    61 min: Ferreira fires a shot off the setup by Arriola but it\u2019s sent directly at Alyami, who makes the elementary save.     8.18pm    60 min: Pulisic takes the free kick off the Yedlin foul and it\u2019s cleared harmlessly from danger.     8.18pm    59 min: On comes Joe Scally, the 19-year-old from Long Island, in place of Yedlin. It\u2019s his third international appearance. Two more substitutions for Berhalter: McKenzie on for Long and Ferreira on for Pepi (who finished with a scant 13 touches).  Updated at 8.26pm BST    8.16pm    57 min: Yedlin makes a cross into the middle but he\u2019s brought down by Abdulhamid in a heap. A very late tackle above the ankle. Abdulhamid is shown yellow for his efforts.     8.14pm    56 min: Saudi Arabia are dispossessed by Arriola in a dangerous area, but his immediate cross into the box is intercepted and Saudi Arabia are on the attack again.     8.11pm    51 min: Saudi Arabia win a free kick near the halfway line. Moments later Aldawsari crosses into the box, but Turner is there to punch it away. A toothless start for the United States to start this second half.     8.07pm    48 min: The corner is cleared from the box past the touchline for a Saudi Arabia throw-in. Nothing comes of it and the US take over possession.     8.06pm    47 min: Saudi Arabia win their first corner of a match. VAR is briefly consulted to determine if Yedlin touched the ball with his hand, but the appeals for a free kick are denied.     8.03pm    \u201cIt is obviously not the greatest playing surface,\u201d says former USMNT defender turned pundit Alexi Lalas over on Fox. Other than that, Mrs Lincoln, how was the play? The players are back on the pitch for the second half. No substitutions for the United States or Saudi Arabia. Additionally, Berhalter has confirmed that Reyna\u2019s exit was precautionary and for no reason in particular.  Updated at 8.12pm BST    7.52pm   Half-time: Saudi Arabia 0-0 USA  It\u2019s better than Friday\u2019s showing against Japan, just. But the US will need to show a lot more than they have so far today to quell the mounting concerns around this side with their World Cup opener against Wales only 54 days away.     7.47pm    45 min: The fourth official signals for one minute of stoppage time.     7.46pm    42 min: The US win another corner but nothing comes from it. As the first half winds down, the Americans\u2019 offensive strategy has essentially boiled down to: play offside balls over the top.     7.45pm    40 min: Pulisic appeared to be fouled by Abdulhamid just inside the area near the goal line but nothing from the referee.     7.42pm    37 min: Pulisic takes a hard foul off the ball, shortly after a late tackle on McKennie. The referee doesn\u2019t issue a yellow for either. It\u2019s also being reported that Gio Reyna\u2019s substitution at the half-hour mark was not planned. Not great.  Updated at 8.33pm BST    7.39pm    34 min: The Yedlin-Acosta-Arriola side of the field won\u2019t have Saudi Arabia shaking in their boots. Woof.     7.32pm    30 min: A pair of substitutions at the half-hour mark. For the United States, Reyna is coming off for Paul Arriola. For Saudi Arabia, Alnajei exits in place of Asiri. Remember: Six substitutions are allowed in three different moments under today\u2019s rules (half-time does not count as a substitution moment).  Updated at 7.33pm BST    7.30pm    28 min: Babhir\u2019s free kick sails harmlessly over the crossbar and the Americans are on the attack again.  Updated at 8.44pm BST    7.29pm    27 min: The US win a free kick and Reyna\u2019s effort sails right over his target amid complaints from the Americsans of a foul. Saudi Arabia are quick on the counter-attack and a foul by Acosta gives the Green Falcons a free kick of their own from a dangerous area about 25 yards from the goal.     7.25pm    24 min: Poor clearance by Saudi Arabia after a failed US attack and the ball pops out to Tyler Adams, whose shot from about 20 yards skids just wide left of the post.     7.21pm    19 min: A nifty give-and-go from Pulisic to McKennie and back up the left flank. Pulisic then tries to pick out Pepi in the center, but the entry pass is blocked backwards and he dummies it out for a corner. Nothing comes of it, but Saudi Arabia can\u2019t maintain possession and the US will try to build again from the middle third.     7.18pm    16 min: Yedlin picks out a wide-open Pulisic with a long ball to the top of the area, but he\u2019s quickly swarmed by a gaggle of Saudi Arabia defenders and dispossessed. The United States are still trying to crack this high press, but generally look sharper and more organized than the Japan match.     7.15pm    13 min: A very poor giveaway by Adams in the back gives Saudi Arabia a clear opportunity on the goal, but the shot is fired wide left of the target.     7.11pm    9 min: Alyami makes his first save of the night, easily corralling a right-footed shot by McKennie from the top of the area. That\u2019s the third time the Juventus man has made a deep run into the final third.     7.09pm    6 min: Some nice combination passing up the left flank involving Pulisic and Pepi creates another chance for the United States, but McKennie is just a whisker offside. Saudi Arabia are playing an extremely high line, which should offer opportunity for the American front line.     7.06pm    4 min: The US have been doing a lot of defending in the opening minutes. Then suddenly Saudi Arabia are dispossessed and Reyna sends a long ball to Pepi, who is alone on goal. But he\u2019s just a step offside.     7.03pm    1 min: And we\u2019re off! Saudi Arabia kick off and attack from left to right wearing their all-white kicks, the United States from right to left in their all-white strips. And it takes only 25 seconds for US goalkeeper Matt Turner to be tested. Alghanam fires a shot through traffic on goal but the Arsenal backup parries it away.  Updated at 8.45pm BST    6.58pm    The players have emerged from the tunnel to a nearly empty Estadio Nueva Condomina. Big lockdown atmosphere! First a recording of the Star-Spangled Banner, then a recording of Saudi Arabia\u2019s national anthem. We should be under way momentarily and we\u2019ll pick it up with minute-by-minute coverage from there.     6.52pm    Berhalter\u2019s XI for today\u2019s friendly (average age: 25 years, 73 days) is an experienced one by this cycle\u2019s standards. The starters have averaged 33 international appearances, the highest for a US lineup in nearly three years. A couple of other newsy notes: \u2022 Yedlin will make his 75th appearance, moving into a tie with Mike Burns for 31st on the team\u2019s all-time caps list. But he\u2019s the first to reach the milestone since Jozy Altidore in 2014. \u2022 Pepi earns his first appearance since starting the final World Cup qualifier at Costa Rica on 30 March. The 19-year-old from El Paso, who was recently loaned to Dutch side Groningen and scored his first goal in nearly a year, gets the call in front alongside Pulisic, who missed the Japan match on Friday due to an injury picked up in training. \u2022 The United States have played six times all-time against Saudi Arabia, winning three, losing two and drawing one. But this is their first meeting since the third-place match of the 1999 Confederations Cup, when the US won 2-0 behind goals from Paul Bravo and Brian McBride (and Berhalter started at center back).  \u2022 Interestingly enough (or not), Berhalter also made his international debut against Saudi Arabia in a friendly on 19 October 1994 in Dharan. \u2022 Matt Turner becomes the ninth USMNT goalkeeper to earn 20 caps. The 27-year-old Arsenal backup holds a record of 14 wins, three losses and two draws, keeping 13 clean sheets in his previous 19 appearances. \u2022 Acosta, Adams and McKennie line up together in a three-man midfield for the first time. It\u2019s also the first time Pepi, Pulisic and Reyna will play alongside each other up front.  Updated at 6.54pm BST    6.31pm   The teams!  Berhalter has made four changes to the lineup from Friday\u2019s match against Japan. DeAndre Yedlin is in on the back line, Kellyn Acosta joins the midfield while Ricardo Pepi and Christian Pulisic are up top. Saudi Arabia XI: M Alyami, S Abdulhamid, A Albulayhi (C), A Alamri, S Alghanam, N Aldawsari, R Sharahili, A Alhassan, H Babhir, F Alburaikan, S Alnajei Subs: F Alqarni, N Alaqidi, A Madu, H Altambakti, A Bamasaud, A Alnashri, M Kanoo, N Alabid, F Almuwallad, H Asiri, H Camara Manager: Gregg Berhalter USA XI: M Turner, S Dest, W Zimmerman, T Adams, A Long, W McKennie, C Pulisic (C), R Pepi, G Reyna, D Yedlin, K Acosta Subs: E Horvath, S Johnson, S Vines, P Arriola, J Ferreira, B Aaronson, E Palmer-Brown, J Morris, L De La Torre, J Cardoso, M McKenzie, M Tillman, J Sargent, J Scally Manager: Herve Renard Referee: Ivan Bebek (Croatia)  Updated at 8.45pm BST    6.27pm   Preamble  Hello and welcome to Murcia as the United States meet Saudi Arabia in their last friendly before Qatar 2022. Gregg Berhalter\u2019s side enter today\u2019s final tune-up coming off an underwhelming 2-0 defeat against Japan on Friday in which they failed to record a shot on target and in need of a far more positive showing today at the Estadio Nueva Condomina to allay fears with the World Cup less than eight weeks away. Kickoff is just over a half hour away. We\u2019ll be back with the team sheets directly.  Updated at 6.30pm BST    6.00pm    Bryan will be here shortly. In the meantime, here\u2019s how the US got on in their previous game: Daichi Kamada scored following Weston McKennie\u2019s giveaway in the 24th minute, Kaoru Mitoma added a goal in the 88th, and Japan beat a lackluster and injury-depleted United States 2-0 on Friday in D\u00fcsseldorf, Germany, in the Americans\u2019 next-to-last World Cup warmup. The Americans failed to get a single shot on goal, playing a dismal first half and showing only slightly more initiative after four changes at halftime. They have one win, five losses and four draws in 10 road games since a victory at Northern Ireland in March 2021, and just one goal in their last five away games. US star Christian Pulisic did not dress because of an unspecified injury. The 14th-ranked Americans already were without Tim Weah, Yunus Musah, Chris Richards, Antonee Robinson and Zack Steffen, and Miles Robinson will miss the World Cup because of a torn achilles. A series of defensive breakdowns plagued the US in the first half and put pressure on goalkeeper Matt Turner, who has played just one match this season for Arsenal. Turner made a pair of diving saves in the second half, on Junya Ito in the 55th and Kamada in the 65th.  "

                    "body": "If there was ever a game for Garang Kuol, this was it \u2013 and it very nearly was his. With injury-time ticking down, a (very) young substitute was in the box, twisting into space and approaching goal. When he shot on the turn there was every chance the Socceroos might have pushed Argentina to 120 minutes. Had Emiliano Martinez possessed slightly shorter arms, anything was possible. It took a dive and a stretch to deny Kuol, but his 25 or so minutes on the pitch at the Ahmad bin Ali Stadium was a landmark moment, not just for the teenager himself but also for the World Cup. At 18 years and 79 days, Kuol became the youngest player to play in the knockout stages at a finals since Pel\u00e9 in 1958.  In the lead-up to the tournament, when expectations around Australia\u2019s campaign were non-existent, there was a sense that the country at least had a secret X-factor, a kid who could maybe do something wondrous to shock an opponent and show off to the world. A lot has happened since then, and quite a few X-factors have made themselves known. But Kuol\u2019s almost-equaliser felt like a fine way to finish \u2013 a sort of hat-tip to the future. Liked what you saw there? You just wait \u2018til 2026. Kuol talks with his feet more than his mouth, in short, no-nonsense statements. \u201cTo be honest, I didn\u2019t really see much,\u201d he says of his late chance. \u201cJust tried to turn around and shoot, but on the replay I can see the keeper rushed out. Just a learning curve. Pretty tough it didn\u2019t go in. Good save.\u201d Before he was subbed on, he had told himself he would score. Arnold had told him the same thing. \u201cBoth had the same expectations,\u201d he says. \u201cSo when I wasn\u2019t able to score I was very disappointed. Just got to move on.\u201d It is the mention of Lionel Messi that lights up something on his face. \u201cGoing one on one with Messi for a bit, like a dream,\u201d he says, before turning his attention to what this Socceroos team can become. \u201cI think in the future you\u2019ll see a team at the level of Brazil and Argentina. People think [players] in Europe can fly or something. All humans, all with two feet. It\u2019s just about the passion and the heart.\u201d Kuol knows all about that. He is yet to start a senior football match, selected by Arnold on form off the bench for the Central Coast Mariners. That\u2019s kind of also how he was selected by Newcastle United, a surreal leap reserved for only the most promising talent who turned heads playing for the A-League All-Stars against Barcelona in May. When he signed with Newcastle at the end of September, Eddie Howe preached patience in the face of excitement, prefaced a loan move with a view to develop a future Premier League player. At which club that development will take place remains an unanswered question, though somewhere in Portugal is a reported possibility. \u201cNot too sure yet, exciting,\u201d Kuol says, before being stopped mid-sentence by a Socceroos media handler who promptly moved him on and told journalists only to ask questions about the World Cup. Before he goes anywhere, he will return to the Mariners for a final few games, and to see the community which had watched their young star in Qatar from a distance. Kuol, the youngest Socceroo since Harry Kewell in 1996, has been followed closely and en masse from his home town of Shepparton in northern Victoria, where his family moved as refugees after fleeing South Sudan via his birthplace, Egypt. \u201cHe makes us so happy,\u201d Kuol\u2019s aunty, Agoness, said last week. \u201cIt makes us feel like we can fly, watching him play at the World Cup. And [we\u2019re] so happy for his parents, who worked so hard for this.\u201d"

                    "body": "This time, there would be no Andrea Pirlo masterclass. Thomas M\u00fcller and Mesut \u00d6zil did not cut England to ribbons. Nobody got a red card. No classic shootout malaise. There was not an Icelandic player in sight at Al Bayt Stadium on Saturday night, unless one of them had somehow managed to buy a ticket. No familiar second-half regression, no midfield collapse.\nIn short, there are no easy targets here, no effigies to burn. The common consensus, indeed, is that England played well. Which is nice. It\u2019s lovely that England played well. England have been playing well for a few years now. And yet the result was the same that Roy Hodgson\u2019s side achieved in 2012, the same as three Sven-G\u00f6ran Eriksson sides, the same as Diego Maradona\u2019s Argentina in 2010 and Germany in 1994. Which leads to a pointed and open-ended question: does any of the above really matter?\nIn essence, this is a question about what sort of footballing nation England wants to be these days. How much do England really need to win one of these tournaments? How should we want to measure success and failure? Where should we be pitching our expectations?\n\nI use the first person here because really these are questions for all of us to answer: not just players and coaches and administrators and the media but fans and the public. There is a common view out there which seems to be that this time we can spare ourselves the finger-pointing and vindictiveness, set aside the lust for purgation and new blood, and simply applaud a fine performance by a fine team against slightly better opponents. This, in itself, probably represents progress. Top eight in the world: this is not a bad thing. Perhaps this is enough. Perhaps this is fine.\nThis is why the defeat by France was so interesting on so many levels. If you were predisposed to giving England the benefit of the doubt, you have pretty much every escape clause in the book available to you. A top-tier opposition, perhaps even the best in the world. The right team selection. A brave, forward-oriented system and a good performance. A strong run of results to get there in the first place. No misdemeanours or avoidable blunders or squad rifts or off\u2011field disgrace. A certain degree of misfortune in the refereeing decisions that went against England. Even the key passage of play came from a genuine unicorn event: Harry Kane missing a pressure penalty.\n\nEngland ticked all the boxes here, and in so doing generated about as palatable a tournament defeat as it is possible to conceive. But of course these expectations and judgments do not occur in a vacuum. They create the emotional weather around a team, who can sense on some deep subconscious level what the reaction to success or failure will be. England players of the past have talked of playing in tournament games and being able to envision the public and media uproar even before it happened.\nAnd so is it possible that on some deeply unconscious level, the very concept of a palatable defeat can somehow self-prophesy it? Or, put more bluntly: did England\u2019s players and Gareth Southgate need to win this World Cup enough? Did they need to win it like Lionel Messi so clearly needs to win it? Wanting it, striving for it, trying your hardest, is one thing. But should England be more than simply proud and disappointed? Because if the goal of Southgate\u2019s England is to win a trophy at any cost, then quite clearly it is not working.\n\nBut of course there are other perfectly noble and legitimate aims for a national football team. Connection with the fans and the broader public. Self-expression and pride. Making the journey as worthwhile as the destination. Indeed for about 95% of the world\u2019s nations the goal is simply to challenge, to give it everything, to keep improving.\nThe debate over Southgate\u2019s future seems to encapsulate this. Take Morocco, for example, who have just reached the semi-finals with a coach they hired four months ago. Not everything has to be a holistic process of growth, learning and empowerment. Sometimes you really just do need to get some talented guys in a room, shout a few things and play like the hounds of hell for four weeks.\nMaybe Southgate is the guy to do this. Maybe he isn\u2019t. Maybe the next step is to take a leaf out of the Lionesses\u2019 book and recognise when a longstanding mental block requires an outside influence. For all the improvements made by Mark Sampson and Phil Neville, it took Sarina Wiegman, a coach who had been to the top step of the podium before, to get them over the line.\nWhat is more important by far is a group of players able to make their own decisions on the pitch, able to recognise the kill when it is in their sights. Perhaps it is worth noting that the dominant coaching influence in the France squad is Carlo Ancelotti, the king of the knockout competition. Six of them have played for him at Paris or Madrid (seven if you include Karim Benzema, originally named before injury).\nBy contrast the dominant influence in the England squad is Pep Guardiola, the king of the process. That dynamic was in evidence again here: like a Guardiola side, England simply carried on their work, in the conviction that eventually the balance of play would reward them. If England v France were played over a 38-game league season, England would probably be champions. But France, like Ancelotti, grasp that actually you only get to play it once.\nIf you are a five-time champion such as Brazil or a smaller nation such as Wales, perhaps this is an easier call to make. But for England, whose self-image is wrapped up in all sorts of contradictory motifs \u2013 colonial heritage and postcolonial angst, nationalism and internationalism, Premier League wealth and local tribalism \u2013 it has often been the very source of their confusion.\nPerhaps this all strikes you as slightly nebulous, a little pseudo\u2011psychological. In fact it is the one fundamental question that every national sporting team must address before all others: what do we actually want?"

                    "body": "Most of Valencia\u2019s fans didn\u2019t see the goal that momentarily pulled them clear of the relegation zone but they did see the goals that pushed them back in again. They were at Mestalla on Saturday night but not in Mestalla when Samu Castillejo\u2019s 16th-minute shot put them one up against Athletic Club. Instead, they were still outside, desperate to escape the abyss. Beyond the wall, Castillejo\u2019s first goal since September came to a backdrop of empty seats and packed streets, yellow everywhere, but at least offered brief hope of a first win in three months; when those fans finally headed in, it was taken away again, a 2-1 defeat deepening their desperation.\nWith Valencia winless since the World Cup, their 15th coach in nine years on the verge of replacement two games into his eighth stint in charge and relations between supporters and owners broken, the crisis deeper than just defeats, a protest had been called. Valencia faced Athletic on Saturday and more than 50 supporters\u2019 groups and thousands of fans had agreed not to go into the ground until minute 19, the year of the club\u2019s foundation. One local paper, long lined up in vociferous opposition, claimed survival was on the line, on and off the pitch, and so they gathered on Avenida Suecia with banners and balloons, the street jammed all the way along the main facade of the stadium, a sea of people demanding the departure of Peter Lim.\n\nThere have been other protests, from art, to mariachi bands following directors, marches and endless hankie waves, that classic symbol of disapproval, but this was the image the club most wanted to avoid \u2013 president Layhoon Chan had admitted that last time supporters had left the team playing before empty seats it had hurt and this time security guards tried to stop pictures being taken from the balcony overlooking the street \u2013 which is why they did it.\nYellow cards everywhere declared \u201cLim, go home.\u201d There were \u2018For Sale\u2019 signs. A banner spelled it out in a list of languages: Sell. Others declared the club \u201cour passion, your business\u201d and declared themselves \u201cagainst Mendes\u2019s Mafia\u201d. There were calls to action from local politicians. A couple of others were darker, threatening even. Protest songs pleaded with the owners to leave. \u201cPeter, go now!\u201d they sang, over and over. The whistles had ears smoking along with the flares. When the PA announcer inside shouted \u201cCome on, fans!\u201d before kick off the volume rose but not the way he planned, the response coming from outside.\n\n\u201cIt was strange,\u201d Athletic coach Ernesto Valverde said. He was right: this was a surreal experience. In here, the game; out there, the people. At one point, the brass band began to play, soon overwhelmed from the sound of the street. Some supporters argued that the team needed their support but if there were maybe 7,ooo or 8,000 inside at kick off, there could have been three times that on Avenida Suecia. By the time Castillejo gave Valencia the lead there might have been 10,000 in Mestalla yet many more celebrated outside, a tiny delay in cheering a goal they wanted so badly but had not witnessed.\nWhen Singaporean billionaire Peter Lim took over in 2014, there was relief. Celebration, even. Valencia had two stadiums \u2013 one they couldn\u2019t build and another they couldn\u2019t sell \u2013 and millions of euros of debt. They had had bad owners and worse owners; by then they had a bank owner, calling in debt. One former president tried to kidnap another. The best players left, one after another: David Villa, David Silva, Juan Mata, Jordi Alba, Roberto Soldado and the rest. Statistically the world\u2019s best team in 2004, twice league champions, Uefa Cup winners, twice Champions league finalists, Valencia should be a huge club \u2013 they are a huge club \u2013 but they were in crisis.\n\nThis was their way out, so it goes. Set up by the then president Amadeo Salvo and agent Jorge Mendes, Lim paid \u20ac22m and loaned a further \u20ac72m for a 70% share which has since gone beyond 80% with his total outlay now above \u20ac200m. But at worse, fans wonder about his motivation; at best, they think he doesn\u2019t care. The money is real, Lim continuing to inject cash to keep the club going, and others before failed, but he hasn\u2019t been at Mestalla in almost five years. The breakdown is complete, the hostility not hidden, the damage done. Relegation, a real possibility, might make it irreversible.\nOne front page from 2014 shows Lim with a headline calling him scary: Valencia were going to be big again, opponents would should be frightened Instead, it is their own supporters who are. \nWhen Castillejo scored on Saturday night, it lifted Valencia from the relegation zone where they had started that morning following C\u00e1diz\u2019s win on Friday, but it didn\u2019t last. By the time fans left again, they had seen Nico Williams and Oihan Sancet score twice and Unai Sim\u00f3n save Athletic to condemn them to a 2-1 defeat, the \u201cgreen shoots\u201d their coach had grabbed at gone.\nThis is the first time that Valencia have been in a relegation position this late in a season since 1986 \u2013 the only time they have gone down. Out of the Copa del Rey, they have not won in La Liga since November and have collected just one of 21 points. Four consecutive defeats makes this the second worst run in their history.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t supposed to be this way. In the summer, Valencia brought in Gennaro Gattuso as coach. If it has not always ended well before, it needn\u2019t have been the same with Gattusso, and certainly his departure would end up being his responsibility, not theirs. The club needed to sell \u2013 Gon\u00e7alo Guedes, Carlos Soler and Maxi G\u00f3mez were among nine players leaving \u2013 but Edison Cavani came with seven others. The squad, given the financial limitations, looked good, and there was something about Gattuso that felt like it fit, energy and optimism after the tension with Jos\u00e9 Bordal\u00e1s and the gloom of Javi Gracia\u2019s time.\nFull of lines to make people laugh and an approach to the game to make them enjoy it, he came to lift the pressure. He said that Toni Lato was the perfect boyfriend for his 18-year-old daughter and insisted that \u201csignings are not something to worry about; being told you have weeks to live is something to worry about.\u201d\n\nThere was, he said, \u201cno fear\u201d, a message he repeated to a talented but young team. When he arrived he declared he was a lion, not a pussy cat. \u201cIn two, three months we\u2019ll have a coffee and you\u2019ll see,\u201d he vowed. But when it came to it, they did see. Which was at least partly because by then, so did he.\nValencia had lost 1-0 to Athletic, 1-0 to Atl\u00e9tico and 2-1 at Rayo but eight weeks in, Valencia were in a European place, just three points from the Champions League. They had scored five against Getafe, three at Celta, two against Espanyol, Osasuna and Elche. They could play, and fans took to him. But he began to witness vulnerability too \u2013 \u201cyou can\u2019t just go down to the super market and buy \u20ac20 of Gattuso Experience\u201d, he said \u2013 and an 86th-minute goal cost them a win at Sevilla, an 83rd-minute goal saw them lose to Mallorca, and Robert Lewandowski\u2019s 93rd-minute strike beat them at Barcelona. That was followed by a 1-1 at Real Sociedad and a 3-0 win over Betis.\nValencia didn\u2019t win again, elimination in the cup bringing a furious response from fans and the risk of relegation becoming more real. On first-half scores, Valencia would be seventh; instead they are 18th and that is inescapable. Gattuso went to Singapore to see Lim \u2013 \u201cmy wife doesn\u2019t like it, but I have to go\u201d, he said \u2013 and decided to walk away, a familiar emergency replacement taking over. There have been 15 coaches in nine years and six are Salvador Gonz\u00e1lez Marco, \u2018Voro\u2019, always there to help for a bit before returning to his job as match-day delegate. Thing is, you can\u2019t help wondering at what point he says \u201cI love Valencia but this is can\u2019t go on,\u201d whether his service really helps any more. This time even their Winston Wolf hasn\u2019t solved anything.\n\nIn fact, by the time you read this, that figure might be 16. Despite being publicly told he had until the end of the season, Voro has overseen three consecutive defeats, admitting that Valencia could be the worst team in primera, which they really shouldn\u2019t be, and, much like Gattuso, sounding like a man who can see and fears where this might be going.\nOn Monday the club\u2019s technical secretary and corporate director landed in Singapore to discuss another replacement and perhaps the protests that went around the ground and the globe, that glimmer of hope only heard by most fans. \u201cI am called Salvador [saviour] but it doesn\u2019t work like that,\u201d Voro said on Saturday night after another defeat was confirmed, the abyss opening before them all."

                    "body": "A few individuals have caught the eye in the World Cup\u2019s first week. Gavi, for instance, the 18-year-old prodigy pulling the strings in Spain\u2019s midfield; Olivier Giroud, at 36, France\u2019s elder statesman of intelligent forward play.\nIn the eyes of many, though, the stand-out performances have come from Roy Keane, ITV\u2019s brooding, bearded and belligerent pundit. Never previously known for being reluctant to offer his opinion, the former Manchester United midfield general seems, if anything, to be growing ever more trenchant. If something clear and obvious needs saying, Keane is your man.\n\nHis assessment of England\u2019s display in the dire stalemate against the US? \u201cThey looked leggy, they looked one-paced, they looked short of ideas ... Actually a terrible performance.\u201d\nThus Keane, sporting a tasteful multi-tone pastel shirt and the kind of luxuriant facial hair favoured by craft lager devotees everywhere, summed up the emotions of millions of England fans.\nIt was before Argentina\u2019s shock defeat by Saudi Arabia last Tuesday, though, when Keane nailed the ethical quandary experienced by many regarding this most controversial of tournaments.\n\u201cThe World Cup shouldn\u2019t be here,\u201d he said. \u201cJust to dismiss human rights flippantly because of a football tournament ... it\u2019s not right. The bottom line is, we are talking about common decency, how you treat people.\u201d\n\nIt was impossible to disagree. Keane referenced Fifa corruption, while forcefully drawing attention to the fact that same-sex relationships are illegal in the Gulf state. He pithily highlighted exploitation of migrant workers, many of whom paid with their lives to get this show on the road. It needed saying.\nIs it hypocritical of Keane to voice such disgust while being employed at the tournament? Perhaps, but if he hadn\u2019t got on the plane who would be taking it upon themselves to state the bleedin\u2019 obvious on daytime television?\n\nIt is 20 years since Keane infamously snapped in Saipan and stormed out of Ireland\u2019s 2002 World Cup camp, in protest at what he felt were inadequate training facilities. He has not mellowed with age.\nIn Qatar, the possibility of Keane and fellow pundit Graeme Souness coming to blows remains real, judging by that Argentina v Saudi Arabia broadcast. \u201cI\u2019m here to give my opinion. That\u2019s not a penalty in my eyes,\u201d an increasingly agitated Keane said in a clash with the Scot, traditionally not someone to shirk a tackle or a heated debate.\n\u201cI\u2019ve heard you say it 10 times,\u201d Souness responded. \u201cLet someone else speak, you\u2019ll learn a lot more.\u201d If Keane has a blind spot, it is surely his former Old Trafford teammate Cristiano Ronaldo. Despite the Portuguese\u2019s fading powers, and recent attempts to redefine the term prima donna, Keane won\u2019t hear a word against him. Manchester United lost patience, and Keane would surely not have tolerated Ronaldo\u2019s recent antics, either as a player or a manager.\nBut perhaps that\u2019s the point. We are all hypocrites in this to some degree. Nobody\u2019s perfect but, as a pundit paid to give an opinion, Keane is getting there."

                    "body": "Renato Carvalho was 11 years old when he met Pel\u00e9 for the first and only time. It was 1958 and he was a schoolboy in a small city called Po\u00e7os de Caldas. To the amazement of him and his friends, the Brazilian team were preparing for the World Cup on his school pitch. \u201cPel\u00e9 was so thin, he was just a young boy of 17,\u201d Carvalho recalled. \u201cBut I\u2019ll never forget it.\u201d Pel\u00e9 died on Thursday aged 82, 65 years after that skinny 17-year-old guided Brazil to their first World Cup title in Sweden. Pel\u00e9 scored six goals in the quarter-final, semi-final and final, and set Brazil on a march that led to three World Cup wins in 12 years. He remains the only player to hold three World Cup winner\u2019s medals. \u201cPel\u00e9 was the greatest advertisement Brazil ever had,\u201d Carvalho, now 76 and a retired businessman, said shortly after hearing that Pel\u00e9 had died. \u201cBrazil hit the headlines because of Pel\u00e9. \u201cIt was Pel\u00e9, with his art and his football, who spread the name of Brazil around the world.\u201d  The former Santos and New York Cosmos star died at S\u00e3o Paulo\u2019s Alberto Einstein hospital at 3.27pm on Thursday, the consequence of what the hospital said was \u201cmultiple organ failure\u201d. He had been in and out of the hospital for more than a year, after doctors found a tumour in his colon. His body stopped responding to the treatment weeks ago but even though his death was expected, there was still a huge outpouring of goodwill. The Brazilian government led the tributes, tweeting: \u201cFootball perfection; the King was almost synonymous with his homeland. Generations to come will remember him as a gentleman off the field, and a magician on it.\u201d Brazil\u2019s incoming president, Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, said he believed Pel\u00e9 would join a heavenly kickabout with football greats such as Garrincha, Socrates and Maradona. \u201cFew Brazilians carried our country\u2019s name so far,\u201d Lula tweeted. \u201cHowever different their language was to Portuguese, foreigners from all over the planet always found a way of pronouncing the magic word: \u2018Pel\u00e9\u2019.\u201d Carvalho agreed, remembering that Pel\u00e9\u2019s victorious side, the team that won three out of four World Cups, put the country on the map. Before 1958, many people knew next to nothing about Brazil. After 1970, it was forever the nation of football. \u201cBrazil in 1958 hadn\u2019t achieved the glory they achieved soon after,\u201d Carvalho said. \u201cThere was no TV, we used to listen to games on a radio that stood on a stand in the corner. We had no idea who Pel\u00e9 was or who he\u2019d become.\u201d Carvalho\u2019s memories of playtimes with legends remain vivid. He remembers Pel\u00e9 as quiet; Gylmar, a brooding goalkeeper; Zagallo the wingback who would become the first man to win a World Cup as a player and manager, the latter when he coached his old pal Pel\u00e9 to success in Mexico City in 1970. \u201cThey trained taking penalties and we used to stand behind the goals,\u201d Carvalho said. \u201cThere was a player called Mazzola and he had a powerful shot. We were terrified. They said that if Mazzola\u2019s shot hit you, it would kill you, and so when he ran up to strike the ball we all lay on the ground because we didn\u2019t want to die.\u201d Pel\u00e9 was famously humble and many others have personal stories to tell. But Pel\u00e9\u2019s time was long ago and football has changed. The sadness is real but most people believe there won\u2019t be millions on the street to see his coffin go by, as happened when Diego Maradona died in Argentina in 2020. \u201cWhen Ayrton Senna died [in 1994] the whole world came to a halt,\u201d said Donyy Alves, a 41-year-old receptionist. \u201cThat won\u2019t happen with Pel\u00e9. Football is so corrupt that people just don\u2019t believe in it any more. They don\u2019t love the national team like they used to. They\u2019re tired of it all.\u201d Carvalho agreed. \u201cI think people will take his death more naturally,\u201d he said. \u201cPel\u00e9\u2019s success was a long time ago. People obviously know who he is but they don\u2019t know him that well, so his death is a more natural thing.\u201d"

                    "body": "Only Aureli\u00e9n Tchouam\u00e9ni knows for certain whether Emiliano Mart\u00ednez got into his head. With France on the back foot after the Argentina goalkeeper had saved from Kingsley Coman, it was the 22-year-old midfielder\u2019s turn in the shootout to determine the winners of the World Cup.\nAlone with his thoughts, Tchouam\u00e9ni made the long walk from the centre-circle while Mart\u00ednez stood in wait, ball in hand as he whipped the crowd behind the goal into a frenzy. Rather than hand the ball to Tchouam\u00e9ni, he tossed it to one side, forcing the youngster into an unwanted detour as he reached the penalty spot. As if to say: \u201cI\u2019m calling the shots here but you have to take one.\u201d\n\nTchouam\u00e9ni\u2019s spot-kick was poor, pulled wide to leave France needing snookers they would not get. In the spirit of the unfair play that had preceded it, Mart\u00ednez riffed on his opponent\u2019s obvious pain with a celebratory sashay across his six-yard box, rolling his shoulders in an exaggerated manner reminiscent of that famous Harry Enfield sketch in which truculent teenager Kevin\u2019s best friend Perry returns from Manchester having morphed into a mini-Liam Gallagher.\nThe World Cup finally won, the man they call \u201cDibu\u201d would later provoke more controversy with his lewd celebration involving the aesthetically hideous Golden Glove award and his crotch, while standing alongside a Qatari dignitary who looked deeply disappointed. Mart\u00ednez was clearly playing to the gallery for yuks but, as visual metaphors for this stained tournament went, one could argue it could scarcely have been more inappropriately appropriate.\n\nArgentina\u2019s goalkeeper has no shortage of previous in the field of gamesmanship and it could be seen on Sunday even before he tried to mess with Tchouam\u00e9ni\u2019s mind. As first Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 then Coman placed the ball for their kicks, Mart\u00ednez brazenly attempted to disrupt their preparations by insisting the referee, Szymon Marciniak, check each one was definitely on the spot.\nLast year, during his side\u2019s semi-final shootout against Colombia at the Copa Am\u00e9rica, a tournament Argentina would go on to win, Mart\u00ednez subjected each opposition penalty taker to a barrage of trash talk, the kind of taunting that almost certainly played a part in three Colombians missing.\n\nA couple of months later Mart\u00ednez played a crucial role in helping Aston Villa to a rare victory over Manchester United at Old Trafford, repeatedly begging Cristiano Ronaldo to take a spot-kick the home side had been awarded in added tim e as the designated penalty taker, Bruno Fernandes, was forced to stand and wait. It was Fernandes, not Ronaldo, who sent the ball sailing high over the bar, prompting an inflammatory Mart\u00ednez jig in front of the Stretford End.\nAfter Argentina\u2019s shootout win over the Netherlands in the World Cup quarter-final, Mart\u00ednez was at it again, celebrating wildly in front of his own fans after saving from Steven Berghuis and giving Louis van Gaal and the referee both barrels in a post-match interview that somehow did not earn him a semi-final ban.\nFor all Mart\u00ednez\u2019s gamesmanship, it has not gone unobserved that Tchouam\u00e9ni could have been spared any potential torment if his own side\u2019s goalkeeper and captain, Hugo Lloris, had retrieved the ball after each Argentina penalty and handed it to whichever of his teammates was next up.\n\nAlthough a subsequent attempt by Mart\u00ednez to put off Randal Kolo Muani earned a booking, the yellow card was produced too late, long after the psychological damage had been done. Kolo Muani, despite scoring, would end up being the losing side\u2019s final penalty taker. \u201cI did my thing, what I dreamed of,\u201d Mart\u00ednez said of his shootout chicanery. \u201cThere could not have been a World Cup that I have dreamed of like this. I was calm during the penalties.\u201d\nOne man\u2019s dream, another nation\u2019s nightmare. It will be intriguing to see whether football\u2019s lawmakers crack down on the kind of shenanigans for which the name \u201cMart\u00ednez\u201d has in recent years become a byword. Although his antics during these deciders may not be to everyone\u2019s taste, it is worth remembering that we got to witness them on Sunday only because of his remarkable save from Kolo Muani in the final minute of extra time. While he is an undeniably massive shithouse, Argentina\u2019s goalkeeper can certainly play."

                    "body": "It was a sure thing. Unanimous. England would beat France and reach their second successive World Cup semi-final. The meerkats at a Sussex zoo declared it, via the medium of clambering into an England flag-decorated bucket of whatever it is meerkats eat. Not a single meerkat put his faith in Olivier Giroud, there was no meerkat foresight when it came to Aur\u00e9lien Tchouam\u00e9ni firing a low, long-distance shot into the corner of Jordan Pickford\u2019s goal. We should have known. World Cup psychic animals have burnt us before, their competence often hovering somewhere around the level of Derek Acorah. As my colleague Marina Hyde notes, this shouldn\u2019t be surprising, given that, y\u2019know, they are animals. And yet, those meerkats did previously predict the Lionesses\u2019 European Championship triumph and when Paul the Octopus repeatedly called results correctly during the 2010 World Cup the world watched. Octopuses are, after all, a very intelligent species. Here are some others who have tried their hand \u2013 or tentacle \u2013 this year and in the past. Paul the octopus  The aforementioned Paul \u2013 nicknamed the \u201coctopus oracle\u201d is the most well-known and successful of his profession. Paul managed an impressive 87% success rate over the course of his career. During Euro 2008, Paul correctly predicted four out of six Germany results (Paul resided in Oberhausen), and in the 2010 World Cup, he accurately called all seven of their matches, including a surprise defeat to Serbia in the group stage. Proving he wasn\u2019t just a German-hit wonder, Paul even predicted Spain\u2019s victory over the Netherlands in the final. Paul\u2019s method would be to open a box decorated with a flag to claim a mussel or oyster inside. Some tried to undermine Paul\u2019s obvious genius by speculating that he was just choosing the brightest flag, a theory undermined by the fact that octopuses are colourblind. Paul\u2019s fame was such that another zoo offered a \u20ac30,000 transfer fee (which was rejected) and Iran\u2019s then-president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad called Paul \u201call that is wrong with the Western world\u201d. Which is bold, given that babyccinos exist. Paul died three months after the World Cup, probably of old age (he was two and a half) and he\u2019s since been memorialised with his own Google doodle and statue. But the kicker? This German hero was born in Weymouth, England. Mani the parakeet Sticking with the 2010 World Cup, another animal seer was Mani, the Malaysia-born, Singapore-resident parakeet. Mani correctly predicted all four quarter-final results (including the Netherlands\u2019 win over Brazil) by choosing from cards. But he called the semi-final wrong and in the final he plumped for the Netherlands over Spain. Cue headlines about a Mani versus Paul showdown. Mani and the Netherlands lost. Paul and Spain won. Mani was, nevertheless, profiled in Vanity Fair. After his World Cup era he went back to working for his 80-year-old fortuneteller owner, continuing the tradition of \u201cparrot astrology\u201d popular in Singapore. Achilles the cat  Before Qatar came along and took the title of World Cup host with most dubious human rights record, Russia was a strong contender. Harry Kane won the Golden Boot in 2018 but the real star of the tournament was Achilles, a beautiful, white deaf cat who acted as the official tournament feline forecaster. I was already a fan of Achilles. I used to live in Russia and he is one of the Hermitage museum\u2019s mousers. I didn\u2019t see his career switch coming, but he acquitted himself admirably. By which I mean he acquitted himself with heavy bias, picking Russia every single time. \u201cHe loves his motherland and couldn\u2019t vote otherwise,\u201d said the Hermitage\u2019s in-house vet. And if you are wondering why the Hermitage has an in-house vet, there are about 70 cats living there. Taiyo the otter  Japan beating Germany 2-1 in the group stages of this year\u2019s tournament was a shock, huh? Not to Taiyo the Japanese otter, who, though presumably biased, called it. Taiyo is perhaps my favourite animal oracle because he didn\u2019t need any edible incentive. Instead, he clutched a tiny little football between his tiny little paws and dropped it into one of three buckets (there was the option for a draw, which makes it more impressive). Olivia the grey parrot, who has been predicting results in the men\u2019s and women\u2019s game for eight years, did not fare so well. Like most human pundits, she predicted a win for Germany. Naturally, she was abused online. \u201cOlivia\u2019s a fraud\u201d was a typical Twitter comment. Oobi-Ooobi the koala  A Leipzig-based ostensible clairvoyant marsupial, Oobi-Ooobi utterly failed to deliver. Oobi-Ooobi made his picks via eucalyptus leaves, but he was \u2013 how to put it \u2013 awful, getting every single prediction wrong. Heartbreakingly, Oobi-Ooobi genuinely looked quite sad about this. But perhaps he was just fed up about being filmed all the time as part of this PR charade \u2013 or was a tennis fan all along. Either way, he was benched by his keepers. The best of the rest  Believe it or not, this isn\u2019t an exhaustive list of football animal oracles. Fans of furry fortunetellers or scaly soothsayers can also check out Alfie the alpaca (Chipping Norton\u2019s finest), Leon the porcupine, Flopsy the kangaroo, Geda the monkey (who also predicted, alas, Donald Trump\u2019s presidential victory), Boy the white lion, Anton the tamari, Yunona the tiger, Madame Shiva the Swiss guinea pig, Big Head the sea turtle, Dirty Harry the crocodile, Camilla the camel and, rather unoriginally, Nelly the elephant (who also predicts Champions League matches). And finally \u2026 Pele the piranha."

The 22-year-old, who arrived from River Plate in the summer, has made only two Premier League starts for City, Haaland having scored 17 times in the competition. He is, though, expected to line up alongside Messi for his nation at the Qatar World Cup this month.  \u00c1lvarez is in line to start City\u2019s final Champions League group game, at home to Sevilla on Wednesday, with Haaland still out with a foot injury. City have qualified for the last 16 as group winners and Pep Guardiola said Haaland was \u201cstill not 100%\u201d and that he would use squad members who do not play regularly. Of competing with Haaland, \u00c1lvarez said: \u201cIt\u2019s a privilege playing with him and it is always great to play alongside the best in the world. I think we can learn from each other both ways. I like how he always wants to bring the best to the team.\u201d Of Messi he said: \u201cYou always learn just by watching him [though] it\u2019s difficult to copy what he does. We all know what he\u2019s done over the years, best player in the world obviously. I\u2019m lucky to be able to share a pitch with him and now I have a chance to play alongside him.\u201d \u00c1lvarez also played with Sergio Ag\u00fcero, City\u2019s record goalscorer, for Argentina before the latter\u2019s retirement, and drew on his advice. \u201cWhen I knew I might be coming here I had a chat with him,\u201d he said. \u201cI had regular contact over a six-month period with Ag\u00fcero and other [Argentina] players: what is the place like, what is the city like, what is the club like? It\u2019s always good to have information when you go somewhere for the first time. \u201cWe all know what Kun [Ag\u00fcero] did here. He had a fantastic time and did some amazing performances, lots of goals, great goals but all the Argentines here have performed well. From the moment I arrived I wanted to have him as a reference; everyone remembers him with great affection.\u201d Guardiola stated he would not attend the World Cup. \u201cThe best way to enjoy the matches is at home with red wine,\u201d said City\u2019s manager. \u201cWe will have one or two weeks off and then we will maybe go to Abu Dhabi [for training], organise a friendly game.\u201d"

Welcome @Cristiano to your new home.\u201d The picture and statement were also posted on Ronaldo\u2019s Instagram account.\nRonaldo\u2019s contract will run for two-and-a-half years until June 2025, with a total salary of \u20ac200m (\u00a3177m) per year once commercial agreements are included.

Having become clubless during the tournament, he was dropped from the starting XI for the knockout rounds and came off the bench as Portugal lost 1-0 to Morocco in the quarter-finals."

                    "body": "Graham Arnold has expressed \u201cmassive concerns\u201d over the state of football development in Australia, putting the onus on the national governing body on the eve of the Socceroos\u2019 decisive World Cup group match with Denmark.\nIn what could be the final pre-match press conference of his four-and-a-half-year tenure, Arnold put forward his views on the state of the nation and called on Football Australia to conduct a thorough review.\nWhen the 59-year-old replaced the interim coach Bert van Marwijk after the 2018 World Cup, he and his assistant, Ren\u00e9 Meulensteen, also took charge of the national under-23s team with a view to breaking the Olyroos\u2019 12-year-old Olympics drought and transitioning those younger players into the national team.\n\n\u201cIt was a quick fix and it\u2019s not right,\u201d Arnold said on Wednesday. \u201cWhatever happens with this World Cup, I think the organisation needs a review of what\u2019s going on in junior development. Because when I went to Russia in 2018, when I first got appointed to the job, and I watched the them play, I could see straight away that Cahill, Jedinak, Milligan, Kruse \u2013 an ageing squad was there.\n\u201cI\u2019d already taken the job and I needed to find players, and then when I started looking there was nothing coming through. And when you\u2019re ringing A-League coaches \u2013 and you are talking about two players per club \u2013 I could barely put a squad together to go to [Olympic qualifiers in] Thailand and even to Cambodia.\u201d\n\nNine of the under-23 players who competed in the Tokyo 2020 Games last year are in the 26-man senior squad in Qatar \u2013 the faces of a new generation exceeding expectations.\nBut Arnold said the stopgap salve \u2013 which also includes selecting players born and bred overseas, particularly in Scotland \u2013 would not stand the test of time if resourcing is not increased and existing infrastructure not reformed.\nHaving spent years coaching in the A-League with Sydney FC and Central Coast, he has spoken repeatedly about the lack of sufficient game time for young players in Australia\u2019s 26-round top-tier competition and the yawning gap in resources between that and the semi-professional second-tier National Premier Leagues.\nFurther down still, children\u2019s development at the grassroots is often blocked because of exorbitant registration costs and academies not always harnessing the best young talent.\n\u201cYou need more kids to give an opportunity in Australia,\u201d Arnold said. \u201cFor me there\u2019s massive concerns for the future, moving forward, unless it\u2019s fixed. It was a quick fix, and that\u2019s why I did the Olympic thing for nothing. I asked the organisation: \u2018What\u2019s the Olympic program?\u2019 \u2013 and it\u2019s 10 days\u2019 preparation and they didn\u2019t even have a coach two months before.\n\u201cAt least now Tony Vidmar\u2019s in charge of that. The Socceroos are just the icing on the cake and whatever that icing, whether it tastes good or bad, the most important thing is the ingredients. The ingredients are junior development and junior national teams, and if that\u2019s not right and the icing will not taste very good.\u201d\nArnold said he would \u201chire about 150 people\u201d if hypothetically given the reins to make meaningful change but clarified his future remains undecided \u2013 whether Football Australia offers him a new contract or not.\n\u201cAt this moment I\u2019m focused on this, then I\u2019m focused on having a break,\u201d he said. \u201cThe game is growing and growing right across the world, and Asia is growing so quickly.\n\u201cPeople can sit back at home and their opinion is maybe Saudi and Japan are not that good, but look what they\u2019ve done \u2013 they\u2019ve beaten Argentina and they\u2019ve beaten Germany. Asia is throwing a lot of money into football and we need to catch up and do the same thing.\u201d"

                    "body": "Gareth Bale is adamant he is on a \u201cgood path\u201d to be in prime condition to lead Wales at their first World Cup finals tournament in 64 years, despite not completing a full game since signing for Los Angeles FC. Bale has started two matches and made nine substitute appearances since moving to the US in June. He joined the Major League Soccer club after leaving Real Madrid. The 33-year-old forward\u2019s most recent appearance was as a 63rd-minute substitute in LAFC\u2019s 3-1 win against Houston on Monday.  The Wales captain arrived in Cardiff on Tuesday evening and trained on Wednesday morning with the squad. He continues to work to a tailored fitness programme and believes he is slowly building towards Wales\u2019s World Cup Group B opener against USA on 21 November in Qatar. \u201cI haven\u2019t played 90 minutes yet, which is what I\u2019m building up to,\u201d Bale said. \u201cWe\u2019re on a good path to where I want to be. I want to play 90 minutes as much as I can but I understand I need to build up to that because I haven\u2019t done it an awful lot in the last few years. \u201cThe most important thing for me is to take each week as it comes and hopefully that will be good enough for me to help LAFC and, ultimately, be ready for the World Cup. We have a plan in LA with what we\u2019re doing. We\u2019re not doing too much straight away. Every footballer wants to play as much as they can but we\u2019re being clever and building myself up for the last important part of the season. Hopefully, that should put me in great shape for the World Cup.\u201d The Wales manager, Rob Page, said he was \u201csurprised with how fresh\u201d Bale looked on arrival. The 18-year-old Birmingham midfielder Jordan James has received his first Wales senior call-up after Joe Allen and Ben Davies withdrew because of hamstring and knee injuries respectively. Wales play in Belgium on Thursday before hosting Poland on Sunday in Cardiff."

                    "body": "The Matildas will test their World Cup credentials in a four-team mini-tournament involving Spain, Czech Republic and Jamaica next month as preparations ramp up ahead of the global showpiece event on home soil later this year. The upcoming Cup of Nations was announced on Thursday, with world No 7 Spain in particular presenting coach Tony Gustavsson an opportunity to run the rule over his side against top-class opposition ahead of the Women\u2019s World Cup, which starts on 20 July in Australia and New Zealand.  Spain are considered serious contenders for the World Cup title and have a team packed with talent, despite missing two-times Ballon d\u2019Or winner Alexia Putellas, who is recovering from a knee injury. The meeting will give Australia a chance to avenge a 7-0 drubbing the last time the two sides met in June, when several Matildas stars were rested and Gustavsson saw his side fall to their biggest defeat this century. Australia, led by captain Sam Kerr, will kick off against the Czech Republic on 16 February at Central Coast Stadium in Gosford before meeting Spain three days later at Parramatta\u2019s CommBank Stadium. They round off the tournament against Jamaica at McDonald Jones Stadium in Newcastle on 22 February. All match days will be double-headers featuring all four teams. Gustavsson, whose team are on a four-match winning streak, said his side have moved on from that heavy defeat in Huelva and is expecting a much tighter contest in Sydney this time around. \u201cI actually think the players have already parked that one. We\u2019re so much further ahead in our planning and our preparation,\u201d he said. \u201cIt will be a very different game because when we played them last time, we had more than 10 players away. \u201cNow we\u2019re playing Spain on home soil with a full-strength team hopefully. What\u2019s interesting is we\u2019re one of the best pressing teams in the world, [and] they\u2019re one of the best passing teams in the world. Is pressing or passing going to win that game? That\u2019s going to be a really interesting challenge for us.\u201d While the Czechs, ranked 28th in the world by Fifa, have not qualified for the World Cup, FA chief executive James Johnson said he expected a high quality tournament. \u201cThree of the four sides will be aiming for success at the Fifa Women\u2019s World Cup, and we expect the quality of the six matches to be world-class,\u201d he said. The Matildas are slated to kick off their World Cup campaign against Ireland at Sydney\u2019s 45,000-capacity Allianz Stadium on 20 July, but given high demand for tickets there is growing support to have the game moved to the 83,500-capacity Stadium Australia at Homebush. FA is in favour of the venue switch, but any move would need to be first given the green light by Fifa. Australia\u2019s remaining games in a tough Group B are against Nigeria at Brisbane\u2019s Suncorp Stadium and Olympic champions Canada at AAMI Park in Melbourne."

Grealish had met Finlay, a Manchester City supporter, this year after he had written to the City player inspired by Grealish speaking about his younger sister, Hollie, who also has cerebral palsy.\nGrealish had promised the 11-year-old that he would do the special celebration dance next time he scored, and kept his word. The midfielder came on as a substitute and scored England\u2019s sixth goal as they swept past Iran 6-2 in their opening fixture on Monday.\n\nFinlay also received a signed City shirt from his hero, who had negotiated about the celebration. The young boy had initially requested Grealish do a hip-hop move called the worm, but the pair settled on a dance with wavy arms that involved a little less physical exertion and risk of injury.\nHollie has featured frequently on Grealish\u2019s Instagram feed, notably in August this year when she celebrated her 19th birthday. \u201cI love her so much,\u201d Grealish had said in a video.\n\n\u201cWe are so close. She was born three months premature and they said she would not be able to talk, walk. And here we are today, and she can do everything.\u201d\nFinlay wrote to Grealish after hearing the comments to tell him: \u201cIt makes me really happy when I see that you, a famous footballer, knows what it\u2019s like to live with people with cerebral palsy,\u201d and asked to meet.\n\nGrealish said the letter had made him smile and told Finlay, who spoke in the letter of his difficulties trying to play football with cerebral palsy: \u201cThere is no need to get frustrated as long as you play with a smile on your face. That is all that matters.\u201d"

                    "body": "From Birmingham to Borussia Dortmund, it has been an incredible couple of years for Jude Bellingham. Now the boy from Stourbridge is taking centre stage at the World Cup and even though it is increasingly difficult to remember the rangy midfielder is still a teenager, few are surprised he has already made an imprint in Qatar.\n\u201cI watched every game last year and it was an evolution, he would learn little things game by game and start to develop and get better,\u201d says Gio Reyna, his best friend at Dortmund who has witnessed Bellingham\u2019s development at close quarters, paying particular interest when sidelined through injury last season. \u201cIt is awesome to see. We have both had our struggles at times but to see him and the role he has taken in our team, it is great.\u201d\n\nOnly on Friday, when England do battle with the USA, the pair will be on opposing sides. Bellingham, who opened the scoring against Iran, is certain to keep his place and Reyna could make his first appearance at the finals. \u201cHe has been really great with me over the past year. He has been the one reaching out the most and making sure things are all good. When the group [for the World Cup] was announced we were the first ones to text each other, probably 30 seconds after we found out. We have been talking some \u2018smack\u2019, but I love him. We sit next to each other on the bus, and when we fly we normally sit very close. It is just a really good relationship. We really feed off each other on and off the field. He is a really good player and we will both be ready to battle.\u201d\nReyna is not the only member of the USA squad with links to England. The Leeds pair of Tyler Adams and Brenden Aaronson, plus Christian Pulisic of Chelsea, are three of seven USA players contracted to English clubs. Cameron Carter-Vickers, now of Celtic, began his career in earnest at Tottenham aged 11 and Yunus Musah, who was born in New York to Ghanaian parents but moved to England from Italy aged nine, started across north London at Arsenal, where he played alongside Bukayo Saka, and with Bellingham for England\u2019s youth teams, which he captained at under-15s, -16s and -17s. \u201cTo share a field with them will be very special,\u201d Musah says.\n\nEligible to play for Ghana, Italy and the USA, Musah made 32 appearances up to and including under-18 level for England. He recalls a talk from Gareth Southgate. \u201cIt was great to have the England manager speak to you,\u201d Musah says. \u201cI was hoping that one day I would be selected by him.\u201d How did he come to pin his colours to the USA last year, then? \u201cWith England I had a great time, I had nothing to complain about. I had an amazing time, great coaches, a great experience and it got to the time where I had to make a decision for my professional career and I was at that young age. I had an opportunity to play with a great team in the US and on that camp I just had a great feeling.\u201d\n\nMusah joined Valencia in 2019 after seven years at Arsenal, where he was coached by Greg Lincoln, now of the Football Association, and Freddie Ljungberg. \u201cHe really helped me out as well with details,\u201d Musah says of Ljungberg. \u201cWe were on tour in Germany and one day he got us to watch the Invincibles movie [about Arsenal\u2019s unbeaten season when they won the Premier League in 2003-04] and it was incredible to see what they achieved and the talented players they had. It was inspiring. I was like: \u2018One day I would like to do that as well.\u2019\u201d\nMusah\u2019s Ghanaian parents still live in east London but are in Qatar for the tournament. Since being in Doha, Musah, a Muslim, has been able to practise his faith. \u201cI am enjoying it. I was out at a shopping centre and it was time to pray and I was able to go across the road to the mosque opposite the shopping centre to pray,\u201d Musah says. \u201cIt\u2019s not nice when you have to be waiting a long time to pray.\u201d\nThere was a moment six minutes before half-time in England\u2019s victory over Iran when Bellingham\u2019s desire to keep the ball in play led him off the pitch for a split-second before head-butting the corner flag in frustration as he eventually admitted defeat.\nIn fairness, at the moment it feels as though the 19-year-old is in such a good spot he is capable of the impossible. \u201cWhat separates him is his ability to be able to do everything,\u201d Reyna says. \u201cThere aren\u2019t many things you can point at that he cannot do. He is a competitor. He can do everything. [If you] ask him to play left wing or left-back, he could probably do both.\u201d Even in goal? \u201cYeah,\u201d Reyna smiles."

                    "body": "Football is rarely just football and footballers are rarely just footballers. Pel\u00e9 was a brilliant forward, a player of grace and imagination, of explosive pace and extraordinary balance, but that is not why his death on Thursday caused such a widespread sense of loss. Nor is it the three World Cups or the two Copa Libertadores he won. To respond to the question of why Pel\u00e9 mattered with a list of attributes or medals is to miss the point: he mattered because of what he represented. But to define what he represented is almost impossible, not least because, particularly once his playing career was over, his capacity to represent almost anything made him an advertiser\u2019s dream. He existed in a perfect commercial space, somebody of stature and charisma who was somehow also a blank canvas, capable of promoting almost anything, from Puma to Pepsi, Viagra to diamonds made by heating his own hair under extreme pressure.  That quality means Pel\u00e9 meant almost whatever anybody needed him to mean. For my generation, slightly too young to have seen him play, he was always the benchmark, the name that defined footballing greatness. \u201cPel\u00e9\u201d was the player your gran who never watched football had heard of, the inevitable hero of Escape to Victory, the name that would be shouted across the schoolyard if anybody did anything especially brilliant. And of course the name itself in that regard is hugely significant. Would we have been so keen to shout his name had he remained Edson? \u201cPel\u00e9\u201d is memorable. It may be a corruption of \u201cBil\u00e9\u201d, a goalkeeper Pel\u00e9 idolised when he was a child (his own name supposedly derived of an incantation used by the wise women of his village as they gathered around his crib by moonlight, trying to draw him from muteness) but it is perfect branding. Pel\u00e9 sounds like a more exotic form of \u201cplay\u201d. It begins with an eruption of energy before moving swiftly into something more lithe and seductive. Perhaps it is too much to say that with his death went also a lingering fragment of childhood innocence, but the passing of such a constant, of the first global football superstar, of the earliest of what, post-Qatar, it seems appropriate to think of as the Great Trinity, is a milestone to mortality.  But you didn\u2019t have to be born as his career was winding down at New York Cosmos to see Pel\u00e9 as representative of something purer. He was probably at his greatest in the two-legged final of the 1963 Libertadores, when he overcame brutal tackling to inspire Santos\u2019s 5-3 aggregate victory over Boca Juniors. But his most memorable performances, the displays that confirmed him in the affections of the world, came in the 1970 World Cup, a tournament that itself occupies a mythic zone in football\u2019s collective memory. The Pel\u00e9 legend needed that tournament. In 1958, he had been a 17-year-old coming into the team in the third group game and scoring six goals over the remainder of the World Cup, including two in the final. He was youth, he was joy, he was wondrous promise, but Didi and Vav\u00e1 were the stars. In 1962 he was injured out of the tournament in the second game. He may have helped win two World Cups, but neither had been his World Cup. In 1966, the footage of him being led away from the Goodison Park pitch, an overcoat draped over his shoulders, battered and beaten, kicked out of the World Cup by first Bulgaria and then Portugal, became emblematic of the turn football had taken. After the individualism that had characterised Brazil\u2019s successes of 1958 and 1962 (underpinned by the radical innovations of zonal marking and a back four as it was), England\u2019s victory was rooted in physicality and systematisation. The age of pressing had dawned. Mexico in 1970 stood against that. It was the first World Cup broadcast by satellite and in colour. There was a magic to the yellow shirts and cobalt shorts, shimmering in the Mexican heat. Everything felt thrillingly modern: the ball, the Telstar, was named after the satellite, its black and white panels still the default for generic representations of a football.  Brazil had prepared by undertaking a Nasa training course. But tactically, Mexico was a throwback. The heat and altitude meant the constant running demanded by pressing had to be tempered. Individualism, a team in effect comprising five No 10s, the greatest of them the one actually wearing 10, for the final time, could thrive. 1970 was Pel\u00e9\u2019s tournament. The sense of innocence wasn\u2019t just tactical. By 1974, Jo\u00e3o Havelange had succeeded Stanley Rous as president of Fifa and football was entering its era of commercialism. There was a naivety about 1970, when little was slick and not everything was up for sale, that would come to seem increasingly attractive. But it was a strange kind of innocence. The Observer\u2019s Hugh McIlvanney wrote of Brazil\u2019s performance late on against Italy in the 1970 final as representing \u201ca distillation of their football, its beauty and \u00e9lan and almost undiluted joy \u2026 It was not hard to believe they were anxious to say something about the game as well as themselves.\u201d  Yet here was a Brazil side that, though no real fault of its own, came to be used for propaganda purposes by the dictatorship of General Em\u00edlio M\u00e9dici. \u201cMexico 1970\u201d has become a shorthand for that ideal of football, yet Mexico in 1970 was run by the Partido Revolucionario Institucional, which practised torture and extrajudicial killing as a matter of course, and perpetrated massacres of student demonstrators in 1968 and 1971. The dark backdrop was largely ignored; there was an innocence even in the coverage. And at the heart of those contradictions stood Pel\u00e9, the greatest player of perhaps the greatest World Cup, an emblem of something wholesome yet otherworldly, a powerful brand who would himself become in effect a walking billboard, for both products and, less volitionally, for a dictatorship. The real Pel\u00e9? As his 1970 teammate Tost\u00e3o observed, the real Pel\u00e9 was the public Pel\u00e9, the private Edson long since refined out of existence. He was many things to many people but most of all, perhaps, Pel\u00e9 represents innocence lost."

                    "body": "Gareth Southgate has been backed to continue as England manager by Declan Rice and Harry Maguire as the squad attempted to look forward after the 2-1 World Cup quarter-final defeat against France.\nThe feeling in the dressing room was that England were the better team and deserved to progress to a semi-final against Morocco but that the key moments went against them \u2013 most obviously Harry Kane\u2019s missed penalty in the 84th minute for 2-2.\nSouthgate\u2019s future is unclear after a little over six years in the job, despite him being under contract until December 2024. He intends to take stock over the coming days before deciding on whether to continue.\n\n\u201cI hope he stays,\u201d Rice said. \u201cObviously, I don\u2019t know. There\u2019s a lot of talk around that. He\u2019s been brilliant for us. There\u2019s a lot of criticism that\u2019s not deserved. He\u2019s taken us so, so far, further than what people can expect.\n\u201cHe got everything spot on again [against France]. It\u2019s not on him at all. We played the right way. I really hope he stays because the core group that we\u2019ve got and what he\u2019s made for us \u2013 it\u2019s so special to be a part of. I love playing under him and I love playing for England.\u201d\nThe Football Association remains firmly behind Southgate. The chief executive, Mark Bullingham, released a statement on Sunday morning, praising Southgate and his assistant, Steve Holland, for preparing the team \u201cexceptionally well throughout the tournament\u201d. Bullingham made the point that it was a young side, suggesting that the future was bright.\n\u201cWe are incredibly proud of Gareth, the players, the coaches and the support team and appreciate all the hard work they put in,\u201d Bullingham said.\nMaguire warmed to the theme. The central defender has always felt the support of Southgate, particularly over the past 18 months or so when he has struggled for form.\n\n\u201cGareth has been amazing with myself,\u201d Maguire said. \u201cAmazing with every player. I\u2019m sure if you asked every player \u2026 they wouldn\u2019t be able to speak highly enough of him. His man-management. The way that this team has been built and developed over a period of time. He handles everything really well and tactically he gets all the big decisions right. He has proven that again in this tournament.\u201d\nRice said: \u201cI think sometimes the negativity surrounding us will go away once we have won something again \u2026 there will always be that pressure on us. But I feel like it\u2019s starting to sway that way; we\u2019re getting back to a level where people are believing in us and the country is backing us.\u201d\nMaguire described a desolate dressing\u2011room scene after the game, heavy on introspection. \u201cIt was pretty quiet,\u201d he said. \u201cA lot of lads sat there, reflecting, disappointed. Gareth said a few words, Steve Holland said a few words and that was it, really. Gareth mentioned how proud he was of us.\n\u201cIt\u2019s the most disappointed I\u2019ve been and it\u2019s because we believed we would win the tournament. It\u2019s the first tournament I\u2019ve come to where going through and losing in a semi-final or a final would not have been good enough for us.\n\u201cIt\u2019s good for the long term that the mentality has changed in the group. This squad is really talented and there will be other opportunities for them and for us.\u201d\nRice said England had \u201cdominated the game\u201d, restricting France to a few clear chances. \u201cIn my opinion, the better team lost and that shows how far we have come,\u201d he said.\nMaguire said: \u201cWe created the most chances, we had more pressure, we dominated the ball. It\u2019s about big moments at big times. We didn\u2019t take ours, they took theirs. They are the world champions for a reason. And the reason is that they are clinical, they are ruthless, they\u2019ve got experience.\n\u201cI know we\u2019ve lost but it\u2019s probably the best performance we\u2019ve had against a big team. I feel like France will go on to lift the cup. And, if we are being totally honest, we were a lot better than them in a lot of areas. The one thing I\u2019d say about this group of lads, which has been proven again, is that we belong on this stage now.\u201d"

                    "body": "Son Heung-min\u2019s spectacular 13-minute hat-trick against Leicester on Saturday ended his eight-game barren run, or \u2018silence\u2019 as it was called in South Korea. As those Tottenham matches came and went without a goal, the mood back in east Asia grew ever gloomier, becoming darkest just before the Seoul dawn last week when the forward was substituted in the 2-0 defeat against Sporting in Lisbon. However much was said in England about a dry patch that felt longer because it stretched from the start of the season, the conversation was louder in the Land of the Morning Calm. With the Taeguk Warriors\u2019 hopes of a place in the knockout stages in Qatar looking to depend largely on Son\u2019s form and fitness, worries were understandable but it could be that some bench time for the megastar would not have been the worst thing for South Korea\u2019s World Cup hopes.  The last time the 30-year-old arrived at Incheon International Airport was in May when he held the Premier League golden boot aloft for adoring fans and excited photographers. The three goals at the weekend mean that, when he steps off the plane from London to play in warm-ups against Costa Rica on Friday and Cameroon four days later, it is less likely that he will receive the kind of questions that were fielded by the national team coach, Paulo Bento, last week when the Portuguese was asked about his captain. \u201cThere is no concern and I feel the same as when he\u2019s scoring a lot,\u201d Bento said. \u201cWe will focus on what we must do in these two games and I have all the confidence in him as usual. I do not intend to talk to him about it.\u201d Perhaps there should be a conversation in South Korea. These past few weeks have highlighted how one player dominates the national team landscape to an extent that may not be healthy for a country that has long wrestled with the challenge of how to bridge the gap between being an Asian powerhouse and becoming an established global player. For the first time in years, since perhaps 2015 when he signed for Spurs from Bayer Leverkusen, Son was not looking like Son and nobody knew what to make of it. The sight of the forward on the bench as the game started on Saturday made headlines in north London and South Korea. The forward has, over the last four-year cycle, played more than most and travelled more than pretty much anyone. For his club there have been punishing English and European commitments as well as the occasional north American and east Asian tour but he has really racked up the air miles for his country. There was the 2018 World Cup in Russia, the 2018 Asian Games in Indonesia (where he helped the team win gold and himself get exemption from military service, though he still had to spend three weeks training in 2020) and the 2019 Asian Cup in the United Arab Emirates. Add qualification for Qatar with games all over Asia, plenty of home friendlies (the London-Seoul round trip is a punishing one that Park Ji-sung ended up struggling with when at Manchester United) and a wide range of commercial activities \u2013 it is almost easier to ask what South Korean companies he doesn\u2019t advertise \u2013 and there have been a few whispers of late wondering whether he has taken on too much, off the pitch \u2013 from a hugely marketable star then it would be a surprise if Son had not been feeling a little sluggish.  The hat-trick probably means less bench time for Spurs in the lead up to South Korea\u2019s 10th successive World Cup with group games against Uruguay, Ghana and Portugal. It is unlikely there will be any rest for his country because he has been selected by Bento whenever the opportunity has allowed, whether it be competitive or friendly. There have been a few criticisms of the coach\u2019s four years in charge and a big one is that he does not seem to have found, or even tried to find, a way to win games that does not depend on Son. That could perhaps explain why there have been times in the past when Son has shone brightly for Spurs but looked less happy when wearing the red, or whatever shade of the colour Nike insists on manufacturing, of the 2002 World Cup semi-finalists. The burden of expectations of an entire nation can be heavy and the 30 year-old often tries to do too much himself. Media in South Korea breathed a sigh of relief on Saturday but it would have been fascinating had Son not played or scored against Leicester, to see how all sides would have handled this international break. The Chuncheon native has usually come home full of smiles and goals, only to look laboured for South Korea. So perhaps club troubles and a spell on the bench could have produced something different at national team level. Given his weekend heroics, we will probably never know."

                    "body": "Now that teams, fans and sponsors have left Qatar, Fifa is turning its attention to the Women\u2019s World Cup in Australia and New Zealand in July. World football\u2019s governing body is hoping for a smoother event, where people can watch matches and \u201chave a moment where we don\u2019t have to think about this\u201d, as its president, Gianni Infantino, said, referring to the uproar over human rights abuses and player protests in Doha.\nPerhaps that\u2019s why Fifa has so far ignored pleas from the Afghan women\u2019s national team to officially recognise their players. Since August 2021, the athletes and coaches have been living as refugees after a harrowing escape from their country, where they feared they would be arrested or killed as members of a well-known women\u2019s team in Afghanistan.\n\nThey were right to be afraid. The Taliban quickly forbade women and girls from playing sports and, weeks after they came to power, reportedly beheaded a member of the national volleyball team. In November, they banned women from all gyms and parks, even those designated as single-sex spaces.\nThe Taliban\u2019s war on women goes beyond sports and recreation. They have prohibited adolescent girls from going to school for more than a year and less than two weeks ago kicked women out of all universities across the country. A few days later, they decreed that women were not allowed to work in local and international humanitarian organisations.\nAs the Taliban erases women from all public life, the Afghan women\u2019s football team players remain symbols of courage and resistance for their country. Most of the team now live in Australia, where they train for an uncertain future. After losing their homes, livelihoods, and many friends and relatives, the women are determined to keep their team together.\nThe trauma of their escape from Afghanistan and the struggle of adjusting to an unfamiliar country, learning a new language and finding jobs weigh on them. Players have experienced recurring nightmares, trouble sleeping and depression. On the pitch, however, they smile, shout and celebrate every goal with wild enthusiasm.\n\nThough they\u2019ve missed the qualification rounds for this year\u2019s World Cup, the team hope to continue to develop their skills and one day play alongside the world\u2019s best again. Most of all, they want to give hope to women and girls living under Afghanistan\u2019s oppressive, patriarchal regime.\nBut without formal recognition from Fifa, the team cannot represent their country, compete in professional matches or receive the funding they need to support their players and staff. Despite filing multiple reports with Fifa detailing breaches to the organisation\u2019s code of ethics and citing rules that should allow the women to play in exile, they have received no response.\nFor the past year, human rights advocates have been calling on world leaders to refuse to negotiate with the Taliban or recognise their government until they end their discrimination against women and let girls go back to school; many countries have agreed to these terms. Aid groups have been working in Afghanistan to support starving families in the midst of a massive humanitarian crisis and economic collapse. People around the world helped evacuate at-risk Afghans and opened their homes to refugees.\nNow, Fifa must use its power to send a message to the Taliban as well: women belong at work, in the classroom and on the football pitch. Afghanistan\u2019s female footballers love their sport and their country. They know what it means to Afghan girls and women living under the Taliban\u2019s oppression to see them in their kits, representing their home. They understand the diplomatic power of sports; that organisations such as Fifa can serve as a check on discrimination against women and defend equality for female athletes.\nFifa\u2019s code of ethics prohibits gender discrimination; its statutes proclaim that the organisation must \u201cstrive to promote the protection\u201d of human rights. If it wants to set its own record straight, Fifa can start by recognising the Afghan women\u2019s national team.\nKhalida Popal is the founder and former coach of the Afghanistan women\u2019s national football team. Malala Yousafzai is a Nobel Peace Prize laureate."

                    "body": "United States coach Gregg Berhalter named Tyler Adams as the team\u2019s captain for the World Cup on Sunday afternoon, one day before the Americans face off with Wales in their opening match of the tournament. The 23-year-old Leeds United midfielder, the last of the 32 skippers announced for this year\u2019s competition, will become the youngest player to wear the captain\u2019s armband for a US team at the World Cup since Walter Bahr in 1950. Adams has captained the Americans nine times in his 32 international appearances, including seven of his 12 caps during World Cup qualifying. He is one of 14 different players to have worn the armband in the 56 matches since Berhalter assumed managerial duties in December 2018, but was elected to marshal the team in Qatar by a players\u2019 vote held in September. \u201cWe think he has great leadership capabilities and he leads by his actions and his words.\u201d Berhalter said at a press conference on Sunday. \u201cTyler\u2019s a guy that\u2019s just mature beyond his years, and you notice it from the minute you start talking to him. He\u2019s a guy that teammates know exactly what they\u2019re going to get from him. They know that he\u2019s going to go out on the field and compete.\u201d Adams, who has thrived in the Premier League this year after three promising seasons with RB Leipzig in the Bundesliga, will become the youngest skipper at this year\u2019s tournament by some distance.   \u201cIt\u2019s a huge honor for me,\u201d said Adams. \u201cIt\u2019s a very young team but a lot of credit to my teammates because anyone throughout our leadership council can wear that armband and represent us with pride and represent us in the right way.\u201d Berhalter, while refusing to tip his hand, indicated that his team selection was \u201cpretty much done\u201d for Monday\u2019s Group B opener at Ahmad bin Ali Stadium, a renovated 44,000-seat venue roughly 10 miles west of Doha. After describing Wales as an \u201cunderrated\u201d team with a wealth of difference-making players and experience in international competitions, he also intimated that his choices will reflect a proactive desire to play for the result, aware that only eight of 73 teams that lost their opening match at the previous six World Cups have gone on to reach the knockout stage. \u201cWe\u2019re looking at the game in its entirety and thinking about how we can be successful,\u201d Berhalter said. \u201cWe want to be an aggressive team in this game. We want to be able to hurt them, but we also know that they have strengths and they have threats and we want to be able to take them away. \u201cSo when picking a lineup, we\u2019ve focused on guys that we think can execute it from the onset, but also keeping in mind that our [substitutions] are going to be really important in this game and throughout the World Cup. We know that it\u2019s not just the 11 on the field, we\u2019re going to need the solutions to come into the field and help this group get the win.\u201d Beyond Monday\u2019s match, Berhalter also was asked about his reaction to Gianni Infantino\u2019s headline-grabbing diatribe on Saturday, in which the Fifa president accused the tournament\u2019s Western detractors of hypocrisy. \u201cYou know, he\u2019s obviously the president of Fifa and he expresses his opinions as he sees fit,\u201d Berhalter said. \u201cWe\u2019re here to play soccer. We\u2019re here to represent the United States. And we don\u2019t necessarily represent the views of Infantino. That\u2019s just the way it goes. He has the right to express that, and we have the right to have our opinions.\u201d Shortly before the Americans went through one final training session on Sunday night at their Al-Gharrafa Stadium headquarters, the US Soccer Federation revealed that US president Joe Biden called the team on Friday to wish them good luck ahead of the tournament. \u201cI know you\u2019re the underdogs, but I\u2019ll tell you what, man: you\u2019ve got some of the best players in the world on your team, you\u2019re representing this country and I know you\u2019re going to play your hearts out,\u201d Biden said in a video of the call shared by US Soccer. \u201cSo let\u2019s go shock \u2018em all. Keep trusting in one another, play as hard as you can, for you and your families and your teammates. The whole country\u2019s rooting for you.\u201d"

                    "body": "RED LETTER DAY Manchester United takeover stories aren\u2019t what they once were. Time was when they were all about glittering, outlandish promises made by \u201ccharacters\u201d. Michael Knighton juggling footballs before a half-rapturous, half-bemused Stretford End for example, promising to spend \u00a310m (ask your grandad what that meant in 1989 money) on doing up the ground. Admittedly Knighton\u2019s bid failed and he slunk off to Carlisle, where he had fun sort-of claiming he had seen a UFO and falling out spectacularly with local media and fans.  Knighton got a few mentions in passing when Sir Jim Ratcliffe\u2019s interest in the club first began being talked up last summer, the former claiming to have started the ball rolling by touting his own putative \u201cconsortium\u201d to rid United of the Glazer family. Lo and behold, Ratcliffe is now a frontrunner in the race to succeed the reviled American debt-manufacturers at the Old Trafford helm, which will take another step forward with Friday\u2019s \u201csoft deadline\u201d for bids. But unlike Knighton\u2019s glitzy if implausible promises, Ratcliffe is centring his bid on what he\u2019s not going to do. So low is the bar under the Glazers that the most important promise a potential owner has to make is to not do bad things, rather than do anything good. Thus it was that Ratcliffe stressed above all on Thursday that he would not burden the club with debt if his bid succeeds, and there would be none of the leveraged buyout jiggery-pokery that so besmirched the Glazers\u2019 takeover. \u201cThe pain will stop\u201d rather than \u201clet\u2019s have more shiny things\u201d being the essential message. On a similar note, rival bidders Qatar will doubtless be along soon to stress that they are absolutely definitely not directly connected to a reactionary government accused of multiple human rights abuses. That said, their bid is more likely to gain the support of the Shiny Things tendency among the fanbase. Given that the Glazers\u2019 cash-siphoning ways have not prevented United from splurging huge sums on players in the past decade without much reward, it makes a certain sense for the Ineos head honcho to start with prudent no-nonsense promises. That\u2019s also how an ardent proponent of fracking can haul himself on to a moral high ground from which the Emir of Qatar can be seen somewhere in the valley below. Just as well Rupert Murdoch and Sky\u2019s interest was seen off all those years ago, eh? QUOTE OF THE DAY \u201cI\u2019m not going to associate Kylian\u2019s statement with [Neymar]\u2019s picture in a fast-food restaurant. He has the right, on his day off, to play poker, which he is passionate about. I told him what I thought about the photo. There\u2019s no need to mix things up\u201d \u2013 with the stakes raised after the 1-0 Big Cup first-leg defeat to Bayern Munich, and Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 calling out unnamed teammates over their pre-game prep, PSG coach Christophe Galthier quickly folds at the first sign of dressing-room mutiny.  FOOTBALL DAILY LETTERS  I\u2019d like to thank Niall Ruddy (Thursday\u2019s letters) for providing me with the template for my first (and I hope last) missive to this newsletter. In 2002, I was on a KLM evening flight from Milan to Amsterdam. A few seats in front of me in economy class (!), I spotted Edgar Davids. I asked for an autograph, and he kindly obliged. A few minutes before takeoff, a flight attendant came by. \u201cSir, I need to inform you about the safety procedures, do you speak Dutch?\u201d Visibly annoyed, he replied: \u201cSpeak Dutch? I\u2019m Edgar Davids!\u201d \u2013 Marcello Barisonzi.   I can confirm that ninth-tier Fisher FC, currently playing in the SCEFL Premier Division, also have a Norwegian supporters\u2019 group. When they come to London, they plan to attend a Fisher home game in Bermondsey \u2013 Steve Carroll.   Re Mike Smith\u2019s email concerning Chippenham Town and their Norwegian supporters\u2019 club, can I be the 1,056th person to nosily enquire if Hiim and Herdal are a couple?\u201d \u2013 Harry Piano (and no others).   Will the next manager of Chelsea be ChatGPT? \u2013 Krishna Moorthy.  Send your letters to the.boss@theguardian.com. Today\u2019s winner of our prizeless letter o\u2019 the day is \u2026 Harry Piano.  This is an extract from our daily football email \u2026 Football Daily.

                    "body": "England secured top spot in Group B with a resounding 114-run victory against Pakistan at Newlands on Tuesday, reaching a mammoth 213 for five \u2013 the highest total in Women\u2019s T20 World Cup history \u2013 before restricting Pakistan to 99 for nine. Nat Sciver-Brunt \u2013 the tournament\u2019s leading run-scorer \u2013 hit an unbeaten 81 from 40 balls, while Danni Wyatt (59 off 33) and Amy Jones (47 off 31) also shared in the onslaught. South Africa\u2019s 10-wicket win against Bangladesh in the second game of Tuesday\u2019s double header means that England will face the tournament hosts in their semi-final on Friday. The other semi-final will be contested by Australia and India on Thursday.  \u201cWe\u2019ve been building up to a performance like this,\u201d Sciver-Brunt said. \u201cWe targeted this game as a chance to show everyone as a team what we\u2019re about, and to show off a bit.\u201d Wyatt has suffered a frustratingly quiet tournament, with scores of 11, 16 and 0 before Tuesday\u2019s game, but came out swinging: she smacked Sadia Iqbal\u2019s fourth ball of the day through the covers, slogged the next over long on for six, and took a mere 29 balls to reach her half-century. She miscued leg-spinner Tuba Hassan to long-off in the 12th over, while Heather Knight was caught in the deep seven balls later. But Jones then joined Sciver-Brunt in a 100-run partnership brought up off just 46 balls, as the pair deftly found the gaps, and twice cleared the boundary rope. It was Sciver-Brunt who coined the term \u201cJonball\u201d in a post-match press conference at the start of this World Cup; here she epitomised the philosophy (named after England head coach Jon Lewis), facing just three dot balls in her innings. \u201cIt\u2019s important for us to be pushing ourselves and pushing our standards higher and higher,\u201d Sciver-Brunt said. \u201cEveryone has bought into and believes that the way we\u2019re playing will win us this tournament. If we can do this consistently, the world is ours.\u201d The Pakistan captain, Bismah Mahroof, who sustained a groin injury in their match against West Indies on Sunday, had to look on from the sidelines as her team crumbled without her guidance. Pakistan looked clueless in the field, leaking runs and failing to appeal for a stumping against Jones in the 19th over despite the batter clearly being out of her ground. They also had five penalty runs awarded against them, when a throw-in hit a glove discarded by keeper Sidra Nawaz. Jones was hit square on the chest in the 15th over by a Fatima Sana no-ball, but seemed largely unaffected. She followed up her innings with some neat glove work, snaffling two catches and stumping Pakistan\u2019s stand-in captain Nida Dar, as they sunk to 33 for four within the opening nine overs of their chase. Muneeba Ali, who a week ago became Pakistan\u2019s first centurion in women\u2019s T20 internationals, was one of Jones\u2019s victims; while Katherine Sciver-Brunt (two for 14) picked up a couple of easy scalps to regain some pride, after her hammering at the hands of Richa Ghosh on Saturday. Hassan managed a quickfire 28 from 20 balls at the back end, but was run out in the 19th over after a bizarrely half-hearted attempted to make her ground. A second stumping from Jones off the final ball of the match wrapped up one of the most one-sided World Cup matches you will ever see."

                    "body": "There have been points this week when it has seemed that England were not about to face a team in the World Cup quarter-final on Saturday, but a single player. Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 has dominated the plotline like Diego Maradona did in the past and Cristiano Ronaldo wished he could do in the present.\nThe France forward already has five goals to his credit in this World Cup, to add to the four he scored in Russia four years ago. Nine in total \u2013 that\u2019s one more than Maradona and the same as Ballon d\u2019Or winners Eus\u00e9bio and Paolo Rossi. He could still be on his way to becoming a double world champion before reaching his 24th birthday.\nNone of France\u2019s opponents in Qatar has found an answer to his speed, technique and strength. Australia, Denmark and Poland have succumbed in turn, only Tunisia being spared in Les Bleus\u2019 march to the quarter-finals \u2013 when Didier Deschamps decided his star forward should be preserved and used only as a substitute. On Saturday it is Kyle Walker\u2019s turn to try to snuff out that candle which keeps lighting up every time it seems as though it has been blown out. The France midfielder Youssouf Fofana has wished the England defender luck while his international teammate Dayot Upamecano recommended an early night on Friday in preparation for facing the forward.\n\nMbapp\u00e9 will take it all in as he always has and it seems always will, not as an obstacle but as another milestone in his irresistible rise to the very top of world football, now that we\u2019re nearing the end of the Ronaldo-Messi era. And if he gets there (some would say he already has), it won\u2019t be by accident. The grand plan was always to turn him into a superstar footballer.\nIf, in order to succeed, you first need to be born in the right place at the right time, the stars could not have aligned in a more propitious fashion for the young Mbapp\u00e9. His local club, AS Bondy, where Mbapp\u00e9\u2019s father Wilfried used to coach the under-15s, has trained more than a dozen top professionals. Among them are striker Jonathan Ikon\u00e9, a French champion with Lille, now with Fiorentina; and most recently Arsenal defender William Saliba, a member of Didier Deschamps\u2019 squad in Qatar.\nWhat\u2019s more, the sporting prowess of this modest banlieue is reflected in the quality of the infrastructure and the coaching to which the local youth has free access. The young Mbapp\u00e9 could hardly have wished for a more favourable environment if he had wanted to become an elite athlete, which is exactly what he desired, from a very young age. Similarly his parents, Cameroon-born Wilfried and Fayza Lamari, of Algerian Kabyle heritage and a former professional handball player with the Bondy\u2019s club, realised that the elder of their two sons possessed a unique gift which deserved to be given every chance to blossom. The Mbapp\u00e9 project was born.\n\nThe prodigy had a role model close at hand. Wilfried and Fayza had come to the assistance of Congolese friends and provided shelter to Jir\u00e8s Kembo Ekoko, a nine-year-old who had been sent from Kinshasa to France to escape a problematic family situation. Jir\u00e8s, Kylian\u2019s senior by more than a decade, was a promising winger who went straight from Bondy\u2019s under-11s team to the Clairefontaine academy and progressed to France\u2019s junior and Espoirs international team and later played for Rennes in Ligue 1. Kylian\u2019s first treasured shirt was the one that the man he considers his \u201cbig brother\u201d gave him after scoring two goals against Estonia in his first match for France Under-23s. As Mbapp\u00e9 would later put it in an animated film he made in 2020, Je m\u2019appelle Kylian, whose first frames show him emerging into the world from the shell of a football-shaped egg, \u201cI was born into football.\u201d\nHis gift was such that Nike provided him with free shoes from the age of 10 and offered him a proper contract two years later. There again, growing up in Bondy, where Europe\u2019s biggest clubs were known to regularly send their observers, had been a blessing. Whoever shone there was bound to get noticed, and early. As one of the assistants of the famed Sevilla scout Monchi once told me: \u201cBy the time Kylian was 12, all of Europe knew about him, and it was too late for a club like ours to make a move.\u201d Sevilla, at the time, had just won the Spanish Cup and the Uefa Cup twice each in five years.\nThe most remarkable aspect of his ascent is not its smoothness, however. It is how, from the outset, it was framed within a plan devised by parents for whom their child was not an asset to develop and exploit, but a fully aware and responsible participant who was involved in the decision-making process. The precocious child had made up his mind at an extraordinarily young age. \u201cHe could sing La Marseillaise when he was six,\u201d says one of his first coaches, Antonio Riccardi. When asked why he\u2019d learned it, the \u201clittle frog\u201d, as another of his teachers called him, explained that \u201cone day, I\u2019ll play in the World Cup for France\u201d. So better be prepared.\n\nAt the same age, Mbapp\u00e9 would also watch interviews of his heroes \u2013 Cristiano Ronaldo and Thierry Henry in particular \u2013 and pretend he was giving a press conference, putting the questions to himself. This perhaps laid the foundation for the quite extraordinary verbal fluency and the naturel of his media persona. As if somehow the young adult is still enjoying the \u201clet\u2019s pretend\u201d games of his childhood, which he can play in three languages: his native French, English and Spanish; his mother tongue and the foreign languages he studied at school and perfected taking weekly tuition from 2019 onward. Again, better be prepared when the time comes to respond positively to Liverpool\u2019s or, more to the point, Real Madrid\u2019s insistent calls.\nRemarkably, and unlike what so many young gifted footballers have to endure, the plan Wilfried and Fayza had devised for their son involved no coercion, just gentle adjustments if and when needed. The more he could be himself, the better he would become, provided he kept a level head. When did not, Fayza, in particular, did not shy away from telling him off. Such as when he was overheard calling Neymar \u201ca tramp\u201d when he hadn\u2019t passed the ball to him, one of the myriad storms to have stirred and shaken Paris Saint-Germain\u2019s teacup since the Qatari sovereign fund QSI took control of the club. Prospective agents were given short shrift: to this day, the world\u2019s most valuable footballer doesn\u2019t have one.\nEven though Kylian\u2019s parents separated in 2021, Team Mbapp\u00e9 remained united. Wilfried still deals with the footballing side of his son\u2019s career. Fayza looks after his image, his community work and his communication strategy, working (since 2015, when Kylian was only 16) with the Paris-based lawyer Delphine Verheyden. Her VVIP client list reads like a Who\u2019s Who of France\u2019s greatest modern Olympians, including decathlete Kevin Mayer, judoka Teddy Riner, pole vaulter Renaud Lavillenie \u2013 and very few others. Wilfried, Fayza, Verheyden (who is played a flat hourly fee and receives no commission on the deals she brokers for her star customer) are the three bases of the triangle at the heart of which is the 23-year-old Mbapp\u00e9.\n\nWhile other football megastars can directly or indirectly employ hundreds of people, Team Mbapp\u00e9 consists of 30 individuals at the most, the majority of whom are peripheral figures who only intervene when their help is needed. Given the size of the Mbapp\u00e9 business this is a low number compared to the bloated entourage which other marquee footballers surround themselves with in 2022.\nThis may be the secret of the Mbapp\u00e9 project, which contrasts with what was put in place for another outlandishly gifted superstar, his PSG teammate Neymar, whose career has been masterminded from the beginning by his father, Neymar Santos Sr. A long-term strategy was devised in both cases, which included avoiding the trap of signing for a huge club too early, and focused on game time instead.\n\nIn 2013, when 14 years old, Mbapp\u00e9 ignored the advances of Chelsea and Real Madrid and went to Monaco instead. Neymar chose to stay at Santos for at least one extra season, enabling his advisers to expand a lucrative local sponsorship portfolio, before joining Barcelona for the kind of fee which guaranteed it would be almost impossible to leave the recruit on the bench. But there the similitudes end. In Mbapp\u00e9\u2019s case, it was a decision which the player was involved in. In Neymar\u2019s, even if he was happy enough to go along with his father\u2019s decision, that decision was taken for him.\nThis might explain the reason why a world champion can still exude the impishness of the slightly built youngster who exulted in his dribbling ability in Bondy. Why, when he celebrates his goals by crossing his arms as if posing for a photograph, there\u2019s always the shadow of a smile on his lips (\u201cit\u2019s just for fun, guys\u201d) and none of the increasingly tone-deaf machismo of Cristiano Ronaldo\u2019s spin and pose on similar, now rarer, occasions.\nWhy one of the first images that come to mind when thinking of Mbapp\u00e9 remains him zooming away from Barcelona\u2019s G\u00e9rard Piqu\u00e9 in a famous PSG victory, arms and legs a blur, the hapless defender desperately trying to get hold of the speed merchant\u2019s coattails. Why Mbapp\u00e9 can be invited for dinner by the president, Emmanuel Macron (who advised him to stay at PSG when Real Madrid came calling earlier this year), on the rare occasions when duties allow the head of state to organise private gatherings at the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace, and take it in his stride, his credibility untouched.\nTo him, it\u2019s all a game, a game he set the rules for from the beginning. In this respect too, he is a player apart."

                    "body": "Chelsea will be without N\u2019Golo Kant\u00e9 for four months after the midfielder underwent surgery on a hamstring injury on Tuesday.\nKant\u00e9, whose hopes of representing France at the World Cup next month are over, has not played since limping off against Tottenham on 14 August. The 31-year-old has struggled with injuries since 2019 and his latest setback will heighten doubts over whether Chelsea intend to offer him a new contract before his deal expires next June.\n\nThe issue for Chelsea is whether they can rely on Kant\u00e9, even though he is one of their most important players when fit. There have been indications that the club will consider his fitness record during negotiations. That could lead to Chelsea offering a shorter, less lucrative deal.\nRival clubs could look to capitalise, with Kant\u00e9 free to talk to foreign sides about a pre-contract from 1 January. Paris Saint-Germain have repeatedly been linked with him.\nGraham Potter, Chelsea\u2019s head coach, had hoped to have Kant\u00e9 in action by now but the former Leicester player had a setback in training last week.\nPotter can still call upon Jorginho, Mason Mount, Ruben Loftus-Cheek, Conor Gallagher, Denis Zakaria and Mateo Kovacic in midfield. However, Chelsea, who visit Brentford on Wednesday evening, have planning issues in midfield. Jorginho is also out of contract next summer and is yet to agree an extension despite holding talks with the club\u2019s hierarchy.\n\nZakaria is yet to feature for Chelsea since joining on loan from Juventus last month. The Switzerland international will hold talks over his future this week and could cut short his loan in January.\nKant\u00e9\u2019s absence is a major blow for Potter, who must cope without a trio of influential players. Reece James, who has been outstanding at right wing-back, is out for eight weeks after damaging knee ligaments and is a huge doubt to play for England at the World Cup finals starting next month. The France defender Wesley Fofana is unlikely to play before the Qatar tournament after sustaining a knee injury this month."

                    "body": "C\u00e9sar Azpilicueta\u2019s year started with him winning the World Cup and could end with him winning the World Cup, too. \u201cAnd in the middle,\u201d he says, \u201ceverything happened.\u201d The Spain defender is laughing but he hasn\u2019t always over the past 11 months. The way he describes 2022, his 16th year in elite football and the most surreal, difficult and potentially successful, everything really does sound like everything. \u201cIt feels like three years and we\u2019re still in December. We started as world champions with Chelsea, the only [club] title I didn\u2019t have. Then: the war, the sanctions, the personal situation \u2026\u201d And now the World Cup again, this time with his country: a series of meetings with friends and the hope of the perfect close to the longest year. That\u2019s what he wants, and also what he has gone for in the Spanish players\u2019 predictions league. Azpilicueta settles into a chair in at their university training base on the eve of the last-16 tie with Morocco. There is a lot to get through so let\u2019s start in the middle. With the moments when it started to fall apart, Azpilicueta not just unsure whether he would stay at Chelsea but whether there would be a Chelsea to stay at.  Two weeks after winning the Club World Cup in Abu Dhabi, with the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Roman Abramovich announced that he was handing over control of the club. By mid-March, his assets had been frozen and spending limits imposed, doubts appearing about Chelsea\u2019s capacity to continue. Buyers were sought, a sale eventually secured in May. New owners with new ideas, not tied to what had been decided before \u2013 including promises over Azpilicueta\u2019s future. Which is why the captain remains one of the few constants. \u201cIt\u2019s hard, a situation we hadn\u2019t lived before: we changed owners, manager, some of the medical staff \u2026\u201d Azpilicueta begins, describing a void into which the players stepped, taking responsibility and reaching into their pockets: someone had to put petrol in the team bus. He grins at the idea of him standing on the forecourt, nozzle in hand. \u201cNot everything said is true,\u201d he says, but him paying for fuel is one of those stories that is. \u201cLook, many people leant a hand, not just me: staff, people with a passion for the club, who helped in difficult moments. We did what we had to. \u201cThere were some things we did have to pay for among us. Players, staff, and employees never had any problems in terms of getting paid, but there were things we helped with. That\u2019s where you really see people, who they are. Being captain isn\u2019t only about the lovely moments when you lift the trophy but being there in hard times, too. It\u2019s not about your personal situation, but the people around you. And where you feel fulfilled is when those people say: \u2018Thanks.\u2019\u201d For Azpilicueta, there was an added layer, in the final year of his contract and contemplating a return to Spain after 12 years away, a decade in London. There were family reasons to head back as well as football ones. Chelsea initially offered a single-year extension; Barcelona offered a longer, more secure deal and Xavi Hern\u00e1ndez was insistent. According to his contract, Azpilicueta renewed automatically at Stamford Bridge if he played 30 games, but had been promised he would not be held to that: he had earned the right to choose. The change of administration, though, meant those assurances no longer applied.  \u201cI had an unusual situation, because I\u2019d never been in the final year of my contract before. I had the 30-game clause. The club was frozen. We didn\u2019t know who was coming, if they would want me. Everything had changed. What I could do was what I had always done since arriving in 2012: give commitment. The club is my home, I\u2019m the captain. What I could do was be available, play as much as I could.\u201d That proved decisive. Azpilicueta gave himself no way out just as he had decided it was time to head home; commitment counted against him. Antonio R\u00fcdiger went to Madrid, Andreas Christensen and Marcos Alonso joined Barcelona. Many players would discover a convenient injury. Some would stop at 29, refuse. \u201cYes,\u201d he says softly. So why didn\u2019t you? \u201cI couldn\u2019t. I wouldn\u2019t have been comfortable. That\u2019s not me.\u201d But it rebounds on you. \u201cWell, that\u2019s life. I couldn\u2019t do something like that, it didn\u2019t fit. I\u2019ve always been honest, committed: not just in words but in deeds. \u201cI had that clause and the extra year was maybe worse conditions than elsewhere. But that wouldn\u2019t have made me happy. Happiness for me is being there in the hard moments at Chelsea, something we had never, ever experienced before. Those months were a strange situation. The new owners came, trusted in me, saw me as an important part of the new project. I decided to stay. I\u2019m very happy. \u201cIt\u2019s my home. I\u2019m Spanish of course, but my daughters were born there. When we went to Marseille years ago, it was just me and my wife; now there are three kids. We\u2019re delighted there. People at my kids\u2019 school, my wife\u2019s friends, those you see daily, people at the club, are happy you\u2019re still with them. That gives you satisfaction.\u201d If the captain stayed, the coach was soon gone. Now there are suggestions that Thomas Tuchel is a candidate for the Germany job. \u201cWe spent 18 months working together and I learned loads,\u201d Azpilicueta says. \u201cHe had a tremendous impact: European champions in four months, the Super Cup, the Club World Cup. He trusted in me when I wasn\u2019t playing much with the previous coach. I had the best months of my career, returned to the national team, went to the Euros.\u201d When Azpilicueta played in Spain\u2019s 5-0 win against Slovakia at Euro 2020 in June 2021, it was his first game for the selecci\u00f3n since 2018. Now, he is at his third World Cup, even if it almost ended early. Withdrawn with a knock that will not prevent him facing Morocco, he watched Japan come back to win 2-1. For a few minutes in the second half, Spain were out \u2013 \u201cthere were a lot of nerves,\u201d Azpilicueta says \u2013 but Kai Havertz led Germany\u2019s response against Costa Rica, rescuing Spain and sending them through to play Morocco. Time to say thanks, then?  \u201cI spoke to Kai,\u201d Azpilicueta says. \u201cWe have a great relationship. There\u2019s not much you can say: that you\u2019ve been through it, you know it\u2019s hard and hopefully he has another chance in four years.\u201d There was relief but Spain\u2019s passage didn\u2019t wash away the pessimism, given their defeat \u2013 and the nature of it. \u201cI understand it\u2019s hard for fans to be optimistic after that, but on the inside it\u2019s different. You have to keep that balance: winning 7-0 doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019ll win the World Cup and losing doesn\u2019t mean its over. Now it\u2019s do or die.\u201d If they do die, it will be their way, although Azpilicueta advises against slipping into easy cliche as debate begins over whether Spain have to change having apparently been victims of their style. Takefusa Kubo said the Japanese took advantage of Spain\u2019s refusal to just \u201cboot the fucking thing\u201d. \u201cSometimes you have to,\u201d Azpilicueta says. \u201cBut the manager is the first to tell us to whack it if we have to. It\u2019s not like we\u2019re there dribbling around, doing things we shouldn\u2019t. There\u2019s a clear philosophy [but] for a reason, not just playing. It\u2019s the culture we\u2019ve had since I joined the national [youth] team at 15, a way of being the best we can. I watch videos, learn spaces. It\u2019s a calculated risk. We do it with an objective. \u201cMorocco are very difficult to create chances against. Clear ideas, strong up front, quality in midfield, full-backs who are offensive, with ability. They got seven points in the group; no one got more and not many got seven [only the Netherlands and England]. They only let in one goal and allowed five shots, beat Belgium, drew with Croatia. And they have Hakim Ziyech, who has a left foot of incredible quality. He\u2019s in a great moment, confident. We\u2019ll have to ensure he\u2019s in the game as little as possible.\u201d  Azpilicueta hasn\u2019t spoken to him. Maybe after, a second clubmate to console? \u201cLet\u2019s hope so,\u201d he laughs. It could become a habit. Mason Mount next? \u201cThat would be good.\u201d Another laugh. \u201cHe\u2019s a fantastic player. England have so many good players, an infinite range of choices.\u201d And so here he is, back where it all began. It was at the ground where Spain played their last game, the Khalifa Stadium, that Azpilicueta played his first for the national team in 2013. \u201cOnly Sergio Busquets and Jordi Alba are left,\u201d he says. \u201cI shared a dressing room with the generation that won two Euros and a World Cup, learned from them. There\u2019s a transition now and hopefully this can be the place we\u2019re champions again. This is a new generation. There are times you help but the kids now have such confidence. Take Gavi\u2019s debut. They were telling me: \u2018Keep him calm.\u2019 Normally you have to get them going, push them. No, no, not him: there he was kicking people. I was like: there\u2019s no way I could have done that at 17.\u201d Azpilicueta is 33 now. Nine years have passed since his first game for Spain, 10 since his debut for Chelsea, but none quite like 2022. And it\u2019s not even over yet."

                    "body": "It is instructive that six weeks ago, when Ajdin Hrustic injured his ankle playing for his club in Italy, Australia\u2019s World Cup aspirations seemingly suffered a significant setback. Out with the 26-year-old\u2019s damaged ligament went the team\u2019s attacking x-factor, the main man who could be relied upon to create against tough group opposition.\nThe fact that the Socceroos are already on the verge of the round of 16 and did it all without him (and injured winger Martin Boyle), says a lot about the squad\u2019s output in Qatar in comparison to the expectations. But that does not mean Hrustic cannot still have a substantial say against Denmark on Wednesday night (Thursday 2am AEDT).\n\nThe versatile left-footer did not feature at all in Australia\u2019s opening loss to France, but was given a cameo off the bench against Tunisia. The question now is whether coach Graham Arnold deems him fit to start in a match that will decide his side\u2019s fate.\n\u201cAjdin, you saw that he came on the last 15-20 minutes [against Tunisia], so he is in consideration,\u201d Arnold said on Tuesday. \u201cBut this will probably be the first time in four years I won\u2019t name the starting line-up tonight, because we need that extra bit of time to see how the boys pulled up after the game.\u201d\nHrustic injured his knee in mid-October playing for his Serie A club Hellas Verona against AC Milan, and initially jumped to the worst possible conclusions.\n\u201cWhen it first happened, I actually tore the grass up with my hands,\u201d Hrustic said this week. \u201cAnd then I was going \u2018please, please no\u2019. I thought it was going to be worse than what it was, and thank god it wasn\u2019t.\n\u201cIt took me a week for it to calm down a bit, and then I just started hitting the gym and doing my exercises and, getting my heart pumping just so I didn\u2019t lose fitness.\u201d\n\nThe aim was to get on the plane to Doha, and with that came some intense rehab. After two and a half weeks of gym work he was able to start running in the pool. Then he got onto a pitch.\nArnold saw enough to select him, in the knowledge that his training load would be lighter but he had access to world-renowned orthopaedic and sports medicine hospital, Aspetar, which is right next door to the Aspire Academy where they train and stay.\n\u201cI\u2019ve been doing everything I can to be ready for this World Cup,\u201d Hrustic said. \u201cThat all made me realise how much I love football. You realise how special football, and a tournament like this, is. It has been difficult, but this has made me stronger.\n\u201cI was happy to get through half an hour against Tunisia with no injuries, thank god, and I feel good.\u201d\n\nHrustic has been in and around the Socceroos since the Ange Postecoglou era. But he really made a name for himself in a 2021 World Cup qualifier against Kuwait, scoring a terrific free-kick and named man of the match. At the time Arnold said he would \u201cbe one of the stars of the future\u201d.\nIn 2022, with Eintracht Frankfurt, he became the first Australian player to win a Europa League and later that year sealed a move to Italy\u2019s top flight. But his time at Frankfurt may have offered some crucial intel on Danish midfielder and former teammate, Jesper Lindstr\u00f8m.\n\u201cHe\u2019s a great player and a very good kid,\u201d Hrustic said. \u201cHe became a good friend of mine and we actually spoke the other day and I wished him all the best. I\u2019m happy for him because he\u2019s a very humble person.\u201d"

                    "body": "The publisher of the Mirror and the Express is to cut 200 roles in a \u00a330m cost-cutting drive, after advertisers failed to spend heavily through the World Cup, Black Friday and Christmas season. Reach, which also owns hundreds of regional titles including the Manchester Evening News, Birmingham Mail and Liverpool Echo, reported a slump of 20.2% in print advertising and 5.9% in digital ads in the traditionally strong fourth quarter. The newspaper group said this was largely because of a significantly lower than anticipated benefit from traditionally stronger ad spending around Black Friday and Christmas, which has affected the whole sector. It added: \u201cMore broadly, we have also seen the continued impact of macroeconomic and consumer uncertainty, reflected in slowing market demand for advertising.\u201d Shares in Reach plunged by more than a fifth as the company also warned it would miss the annual consensus of profits of \u00a3112.8m in a range of \u201cmid-single-digit percentage\u201d. The publisher told staff the job and cost cuts would be achieved through measures including \u201csimplification of central support functions, supply chain efficiencies in print and distribution, and accelerated removal of editorial duplication\u201d. The company said the programme, which additionally includes withdrawing advertised vacancies, would allow it to continue to shift to a more digital-led and profitable future. \u201cUnder the proposals we\u2019re announcing today we anticipate that, regrettably, around 200 roles of current employees will be made redundant,\u201d the company told staff in an internal email on Wednesday, before a staff town hall meeting. Reach, which employs about 4,000 permanent staff, is also investing heavily in a digital operation to tap into the US market. Jim Mullen, the chief executive of Reach, said the business had been hit by a \u201cdouble whammy\u201d of plunging ad spend and soaring costs, making the situation worse than the impact on the business at the height of the coronavirus. Mullen said the cost of newsprint had soared by 60% over the last year and the business also had about \u00a370m to pay each year in pension deficit obligations and historical legal issues relating to allegations of phone hacking. \u201cAll of this puts us in an extremely challenging position,\u201d said Mullen, in an email to staff. \u201cWe\u2019re not alone in facing these challenges, and we have a way through this, but I want to be honest with you now about the fact that it will mean us taking some very tough operational decisions and strong actions on costs.\u201d In an email to staff, the company said it could not rule out further rounds of redundancies, and that hiring would continue for \u201ca number of strategically critical roles\u201d. The publisher also did not rule out paying a dividend to shareholders despite the profits plunge and staff cuts. \u201cDividends remain a critical part of the investor proposition and key to maintaining the support of our shareholders, many of whom are invested in Reach as part of their pensions,\u201d the company said. \u201cDividend policy is ultimately set by the board and will be decided, as normal, before we announce our full-year results.\u201d More than 1,000 journalists at Reach went on strike for one day in August last year over pay. Further strike action, as well as a \u201cwork-to-rule\u201d order, was averted when unions accepted a revised pay offer. In July 2020, Reach cut 550 staff, about 12% of its workforce at the time, in response to the Covid pandemic. In November, the Independent, where the Russian-British businessman Evgeny Lebedev is a shareholder, placed more than a fifth of its staff at risk of redundancy as a decline in the digital ad market and worsening economic conditions forced the online-only publisher to seek to cut costs."

                    "body": "When Gabriel Jesus limped from the Lusail Stadium field on 2 December, having played 64 minutes for Brazil in a game against Cameroon they could afford to lose \u2013 and eventually did \u2013 the effect on his club bordered on catastrophic. Thursday brought the regrettable sight of Jesus on crutches at Arsenal\u2019s London Colney training ground. \u201cProgressing\u201d, followed by a series of motivational emojis, was the one-word social media message. After Mikel Arteta said he was unwilling to set a timescale on a return from mangled medial knee ligaments, the Arsenal manager next veered into the dangerous territory of attempting to take the positives.  \u201cIf you\u2019re going to be at the top there\u2019s going to be those challenges,\u201d said Arteta, for whom the Christmas restart brings a series of anniversaries. It was three years ago on Boxing Day that his tenure began, a 1-1 draw at Bournemouth from which only three starters remain in Granit Xhaka, Reiss Nelson and Bukayo Saka, who was then playing left-back. Two years ago, Arsenal entered the Christmas period in 15th, doubts circling a manager whose competitive career had begun with that aforementioned Bournemouth game. This time last year, a 5-0 win at Norwich, in which Saka scored twice for fourth-placed Arsenal, signalled 12 months of decent progress and doubts dissipating. Another year on, topping the league at Christmas, five points clear of Manchester City and even allowing for a truncated schedule of just 14 matches, counts as unexpected \u2013 though deserved \u2013 progress. For it to continue, starting with West Ham on Boxing Day and then a New Year\u2019s Eve trip to Brighton, Arteta must locate the means to replace Jesus. Although Jesus headed to Qatar after 10 games without scoring, his leading of the press had done so much to dictate Arsenal\u2019s tempo and forge their adventurous attacking style. Arteta has brought out a side of Jesus rarely apparent at Manchester City. He has been their yard dog, forever snapping at the heels of opposing defenders, an irritant of a level perhaps not seen in the Premier League since Jamie Vardy was in his snarling Leicester prime. Arsenal gave so much to be top when the World Cup came around, with nine players reaching more than 1,000 Premier League minutes \u2013 the joint most of any squad, along with Newcastle. And yet Manchester City can welcome back Kevin De Bruyne to feed Erling Haaland, the Belgian seeking redemption after his country\u2019s dreadful World Cup, the Norwegian goal machine rested and hungry. Newcastle in third can be thankful that Bruno Guimar\u00e3es, who played in that same Brazil v Cameroon game, is back amid their midfield. All while Arteta carries the heaviest collateral damage from the mid-season interruption; Arsenal have also been dealing with the fallout from Ben White\u2019s premature exit from the England camp.  \u201cWe have done everything that we could to support him to again give him an environment that he is comfortable in,\u201d said Arteta. White was able to join his clubmates in their Dubai training camp during the hiatus. \u201cHe has been exceptional with us and that is what we expect for him.\u201d If such issues eat at Arteta, he will not be letting any rivals know. His team\u2019s clear, impressive evolution has gone significant distance to burying any previous idea he was little more than Pep Guardiola-lite after three years at City, with a smattering of Ars\u00e8ne Wenger\u2019s high ideals drawn from the later Arsenal years of his playing career.  This week\u2019s public declaration that \u201cthis squad still doesn\u2019t have the luxury of not maximising every single window\u201d was a reminder to the club\u2019s owners, the Kroenke family, with whom he described \u201ca very special relationship\u201d, that he will not settle for second best in the transfer market. Wenger rarely spoke so explicitly on that subject.  In the West Ham manager, David Moyes, Arteta will face another key, probably overlooked influence. He played some of this best football under Moyes at Everton, often as a winger within a team playing hard, direct football. \u201cI had to adapt or die, basically,\u201d he recalled. \u201cIt was very challenging but for my own education and development as a player, I think it was really rich. Every manager gives you some marks and some moments that build the beliefs you have in you what you want to do.\u201d There is much of Moyes\u2019 stern determination in Arteta, and adapting his own team\u2019s forward line looks the strongest suit in coping without Jesus. Eddie Nketiah, for all the manager\u2019s affection for the young south Londoner, has not started or scored in the Premier League this season. That suggests one of Saka, the 21-year-old \u201cveteran\u201d coming off a fine World Cup, or Gabriel Martinelli, the same age but having struggled to make much impact with Brazil, will be asked to lead the line. \u201cI feel a really good energy around the place,\u201d said Arteta in welcoming his World Cup contingent home, though without Jesus to take up the cudgels, it will have to be a different Arsenal that make their return to action."

                    "body": "Virgil van Dijk has said World Cup disappointment will fuel his desire for success with Liverpool and the Netherlands in 2023, claiming anything is possible in what could prove \u201ca very crazy\u201d Premier League season. An encouraging World Cup ended sourly for the Netherlands and their captain when they were beaten on penalties in a fractious quarter-final by Argentina. Van Dijk\u2019s penalty was saved by Emiliano Mart\u00ednez in the shootout, which the eventual champions won 4-3, causing the Liverpool defender several sleepless nights in the aftermath. Van Dijk, however, believes he can channel the setback into a fruitful year for club and country, and suggested Liverpool\u2019s sights are set higher than finishing in the top four after an inconsistent first part of the season. J\u00fcrgen Klopp\u2019s team have won four successive Premier League games to close the gap on the Champions League contenders going into Monday\u2019s trip to Brentford. The Netherlands captain said: \u201cI had time to reflect. It was a great experience to lead the boys out there and it comes with a lot of responsibility. The whole world is watching, which is something that I really enjoyed. \u201cThings were disappointing in the end for us, that is also part of football. It was a tough couple of days but then it was about switching back towards the most important things in life; my wife and kids.  \u201cIt fuels me because I want to be successful with the Netherlands. I feel like we have a fantastic squad and new era with Ronald Koeman coming back and young players coming through, like Cody [Gakpo] for example. He can make big steps with his transfer and then become more important for us. \u201cHopefully we can do something nice in the summer with the Nations League finals, that is something I really want to win, even though it is the end of the season when you are absolutely shattered. \u201cIt has also motivated me here. We are quite some points behind Arsenal but the season could be a very crazy one, a very strange one. But we have to be realistic and we\u2019re not thinking about the title at the moment. We have to focus on the game ahead of us, win games and then we\u2019ll see.\u201d The World Cup quarter-final was acrimonious throughout and ended with Argentina players taunting the Netherlands\u2019 after the penalty shootout. Van Dijk said: \u201cIt was a very intense game from start to finish for both sides. You saw me doing things that I normally don\u2019t do. [The shove on Leandro Paredes] was something I don\u2019t normally do but it was the heat of the moment and we are all human beings. They won, we lost through penalties, and that is the hard reality.\u201d France\u2019s Ibrahima Konat\u00e9 should be available for the Brentford game after a post-World Cup final break while Roberto Firmino, James Milner and Curtis Jones could return from injury. The new signing Gakpo could feature if registered in time but is more likely to make his debut against Wolves in the FA Cup on Saturday. Klopp reiterated that there was not an endless supply of money for transfers. \u201cI am now here seven years and it is every window is pretty much the same; we talk about these things as though money didn\u2019t play a role,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is never like this. We sign an outstanding player like Cody Gakpo and then you read about the next player. We cannot play like Monopoly. Of course we cannot just spend and never could.\u201d"

                    "body": "Mitchell Duke knew he was going to score against Tunisia. He\u2019d told his family as much before the game, and also let his coach know he would soon join the small group of Socceroos to score at a World Cup. Just to be sure, he did some prep work with his son, Jaxson, teaching him how to make a letter J with his fingers. When the striker fulfilled his prophecy on Saturday, netting the winner to resuscitate Australia\u2019s campaign, he turned to where his family sat in the Al Janoub Stadium stands and made the J sign they had practised. He didn\u2019t know it at the time but Jaxson, who was wearing his dad\u2019s No 15 jersey, made the same signal right back. It was a cute moment during a heated 90 minutes that, in the context of Duke\u2019s personal sacrifice, became one to cherish.  \u201cI spoke to my son as I got selected in the World Cup, and as a striker you need to have that confidence and believe that you\u2019re gonna score in every match,\u201d Duke said. \u201cI was actually messaging some of my family saying that I was going to score today, and I told my son that I was going to be able to share this moment with him and get that celebration. \u201cThe gesture was a letter J for the first letter of his name. I haven\u2019t seen it yet, but apparently he did it back to me from the stadium, which was a really special moment I will treasure for the rest of my life.\u201d Duke\u2019s career has not always been smooth sailing. Something of a journeyman, the 31-year-old from western Sydney started his professional career under current Australia manager Graham Arnold at the Central Coast Mariners before spending three years in Japan with Shimizu S-Pulse. In 2019 he returned to the A-League with the Western Sydney Wanderers before a short-lived stint in Saudi Arabia and loan back to the Wanderers. Last August he returned to Japan with second-tier club Fagiano Okayama, but his wife and two kids, Jaxson and Chloe, live in the UK.  Even in Qatar he has only seen them briefly, during an organised squad trip to the designated family hotel squeezed in between training sessions. The emotion of it all spilled over in his post-match interview. \u201cThere has been a lot of sacrifice for family, being on my own a lot of the time in the last couple years, it hasn\u2019t been easy,\u201d Duke said. \u201cThese kinds of moments make those sacrifices worth it, and that\u2019s the mentality you need to have. \u201cThe moment I scored was pure ecstasy. It was just, it was a crazy moment for me, knowing that Craig Goodwin was only the seventh Australian player to scored at a World Cup. I actually said to Arnie a couple days ago that I was going to be the eighth or ninth, so I\u2019m very happy to be the eighth.\u201d Duke\u2019s international career has been similarly on and off. He made his Socceroos debut in 2013 but spent the next six years in the wilderness, before earning a recall just in time for the start of the team\u2019s qualification journey in 2019. He has been a regular fixture since, and also went to the Tokyo Olympics with the under-23s as one of the permitted overage players. But his consistent selection has been a source of annoyance for some Socceroos fans who have doubted what he brings to the attack. After an underwhelming outing against France, the overriding theory was he might be left on the bench for the Tunisia match in favour of Jamie Maclaren or Jason Cummings. However, as Maclaren said afterwards, he more than played his role. \u201cHe\u2019s a hard-working guy who\u2019s probably done it tough moving around clubs, and had some bad luck in Saudi Arabia and stuff,\u201d Maclaren said. \u201cBut he\u2019s always found a way to get what he deserves, and tonight he showed that.  \u201cDukey is a different piece to the puzzle, like myself,\u201d Maclaren said. \u201cHe brings that physicality. You saw how he rattled those centre-backs early on and they probably didn\u2019t like that side of the game. \u201cHe really held his own and scored a cracking goal. He really gambled on the mistake and the deflection \u2013 it was very instinctual, something that us strikers have. I\u2019m really, really happy for him.\u201d Arnold, who has selected Duke consistently throughout his tenure, said he has \u201cgot a lot of faith in the kid\u201d. \u201cPeople talk about where he plays [club football],\u201d Arnold said. \u201cBut I always know when he walks over that white line he will give more than 100% for the team, but also for the jersey and the nation.\u201d"

                    "body": "Thiago Silva is acutely aware of what is to come. The World Cup is the ultimate obsession for every Brazil player but for a senior figure like him, somebody with so much history, the man who is expected to wear the captain\u2019s armband in Qatar, the intensity is ratcheted up even further. It is no exaggeration to say that Silva has felt the countdown to the finals, which will get under way on 20 November, since his nation was knocked out of the 2018 tournament by Belgium in that epic quarter-final. It has certainly been the case since he joined Chelsea in the summer of 2020, the sense at the club pretty clear that everything has been building to this point for him. The Chelsea manager, Graham Potter, is not kidding himself. \u201cEveryone has got half an eye on the World Cup,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019d be fooling ourselves if we didn\u2019t think that was the case, no matter what country. But it\u2019ll be his fourth one for Brazil so there\u2019s a half an eye, definitely.\u201d And yet one of the things that elevates Silva is his ability to compartmentalise, to retain that aura of control. It was stamped across his performance in Wednesday\u2019s 3-0 Champions League win at Stamford Bridge over his former club Milan \u2013 a display that had the home crowd purring, jumping out of their seats and singing his name.  Potter has a decision to make on Silva for Saturday\u2019s home game with Wolves, even though he will be without another of his central defenders, Wesley Fofana. Silva played the 90 minutes of last Saturday\u2019s 2-1 win at Crystal Palace and he came through the full match on Wednesday, too. At 38, he surely needs a breather here and there. Potter has ruled out Fofana for a \u201cfew weeks\u201d after the Frenchman damaged a knee against Milan. But if Silva plays, there would be no Chelsea fan who did not expect to see that trademark icy smoothness, which stands to be more pronounced against the fire of Diego Costa. The former Chelsea striker hopes to feature after his free agent move back to the Premier League last month. Silva against Milan was broadly in keeping with what he has produced this season and there were a couple of moments defensively that not only energised his team but seemed to deflate the visitors. First, the tackle on Rafael Le\u00e3o in the 19th minute with the score 0-0 and Chelsea still to ignite. Le\u00e3o was Milan\u2019s dangerman, an explosive presence, but Silva snapped in to defuse him with impeccable timing. Then, before half-time, as Rade Krunic looked to release Olivier Giroud, there was Silva stretching to intercept.  Between times he popped up at the other end to threaten on set pieces, helping to force the breakthrough goal for Fofana with a powerful header. At full-time, Silva made a bowing gesture in front of the Matthew Harding Stand as he took the acclaim of the support. \u201cHe was outstanding,\u201d Potter said. \u201cHe\u2019s 38 years old, 38 years young and, when he\u2019s playing like that, he\u2019s an impressive person. He\u2019s a character, a proper guy, who\u2019s got a fantastic experience but has a humility to just do the job.\u201d If it is half about what is around the corner for Silva, Potter made the point that it was all about what was most immediate \u2013 in other words, the preparation for Wolves. \u201cHe\u2019s competing in the Champions League and the Premier League \u2013 you don\u2019t get that by thinking about something that\u2019s six weeks away,\u201d Potter said. \u201cYou get it by being in the moment. It\u2019s how he prepares, recovers, rests and focuses. It\u2019s why he\u2019s so good and why he is going to play in the World Cup.\u201d Silva was an unused squad member at the finals in 2010 but, four years later when Brazil hosted, he was the captain and there were times when he seemed overwhelmed by the emotion \u2013 most notoriously when he sat alone after the last-16 tie against Chile had finished 1-1 and, with penalties looming, sobbed his heart out.  Silva, who was suspended for the 7-1 semi-final humbling against Germany, lost the captaincy to Neymar after the World Cup and Tite, who took over from Dunga in 2016, has passed the armband around, rotating it among his key players at the 2018 tournament. It is an approach he could continue in Qatar. That said, Silva is regarded as the regular captain \u2013 more than Casemiro and Marquinhos, although it will be interesting to see what happens if Tite names Dani Alves in his squad. Silva was the captain at the 2021 Copa Am\u00e9rica and he has worn the armband in 15 of his past 18 starts. Either way, Silva \u2013 with 108 caps \u2013 is a leader and the pressure will come for him. How is he wearing it at present? \u201cWith responsibility, pride and respect,\u201d Potter said. \u201cAll the things you\u2019d expect because he\u2019s so professional. That\u2019s the impressive thing. It gives him a chance to be in the games now and be ready for the World Cup.\u201d Potter revealed that the Chelsea co-owner Todd Boehly had watched training on Friday and the pair had a catch-up chat in the afternoon. The club are close to appointing Christopher Vivell, who has been sacked by RB Leipzig, as their technical director. There was a time when the presence of the owner on the touchline at Cobham would have been a major news story. Not now. This is a new era. Silva remains a constant."

                    "body": "This went exactly how Brendan Rodgers planned it. Thirty-eight days after their last competitive fixture, Leicester made light work of an MK Dons side with bigger battles to fight as they eased into the quarter-finals of the Carabao Cup courtesy of goals from Youri Tielemens, Ayoze P\u00e9rez and Jamie Vardy.\nAn emphatic victory over a League One team struggling against relegation may not be the most significant of his managerial career but after their terrible start to the season, Rodgers will understand its importance. A sizeable contingent of away fans who had made the short journey down the M1 and packed out their end here certainly went home feeling happy, with some even predicting Leicester could be on their way to Wembley again after their FA Cup triumph 18 months ago. \u201cWe go into all the cup competitions thinking we have got a chance,\u201d admitted Leicester\u2019s assistant manager, Chris Davies. \u201cIt\u2019s a case of trying to build momentum now before the next round.\u201d\nWith four victories from their last five matches before the break, Rodgers was clearly hoping that his players could pick up where they had left off by selecting a strong side that featured five who represented their countries at the World Cup in his starting line-up, although there was no sign of England\u2019s James Maddison.\n\nIn the absence of caretaker Dean Lewington as he had surgery on a hamstring injury, it was Bradley Johnson in the opposing dugout instead as the former Leeds and Norwich midfielder dropped himself from the team that beat Portsmouth 2-0 at the weekend.\nMK Dons\u2019 five-man defence managed to stand firm for almost 20 minutes in the face of concerted pressure from Leicester straight from the kick-off. However, Tielemens was on hand to slot home after Jamie Cumming\u2019s save to deny a clever flick from Vardy following a cross from Harvey Barnes, the loose ball fell straight to the Belgian. A momentary lapse in concentration from his compatriot Wout Faes almost gifted the hosts an equaliser when the defender miscued his clearance and then seemed to bring down Daniel Harvey, only for referee Andre Marriner to wave away the appeals.\n\nLess than 60 seconds later and the ball was in the net at the other end after a sumptuous piece of control to bring down a cross from Luke Thomas followed by a brilliant curling finish from P\u00e9rez. Tennai Watson then wasted a golden opportunity to pull one back on the stroke of half-time when he ballooned his shot over the bar.\nYet any faint hopes of a comeback were immediately extinguished after the break when Vardy finished off a brilliant cross from Timothy Castagne with a deft header.\nHaving so far only managed one in the Premier Leaguethis campaign, it was a welcome return to form for the 35-year-old who signed a contract extension for an extra season in August. Whether that may take in another European tour will depend on Rodgers\u2019 side maintaining this kind of form. But, as all Leicester fans will tell you, stranger things have happened"

                    "body": "Sanne Troelsgaard is, by her own admission, \u201cnot a normal professional football player\u201d. Instead of winding down after training \u2013 perhaps by watching some Netflix, like her teammates \u2013 the Reading midfielder gets straight back to work on what she describes as her \u201conline coaching universe\u201d: that is her own company, Troelsgaard Fitness, set up during the pandemic.  As well as being a professional footballer, Troelsgaard is an online coach, providing tailored nutritional plans and exercise programmes to her clients, now more than 30 people. \u201cAll my teammates always say: \u2018How can you just go home and then still work?\u2019  \u201cBut I\u2019m not that kind of person. I always have different kinds of things to do \u2026 for me, it\u2019s also important that you have something out[side] of football.\u201d Her coaching work, she says, gives her a sense of \u201cfreedom, for me, to help people\u201d. It has helped in her playing career, too, because she makes her own nutrition plans (\u201cI always have carrots with me.\u201d). \u201cIt\u2019s given me a lot of structure, that I have to be prepared; I\u2019m a really prepared person,\u201d she says. Born and raised in Vejen, Denmark, Troelsgaard recalls being part of a \u201cnice little family\u201d, playing football with her two older brothers and twin sister in the garden. Aged five, she joined a boys\u2019 team with her sister \u2013 all that was available then \u2013 before signing up to a girls\u2019 team at about 12. Her sister, Lotte, has been with her on much of her journey, playing alongside her for her country.  Sanne played for the municipality of Vejen in her youth and in 2009 joined the top-flight side Br\u00f8ndby IF, having made her senior international debut the year before. Being fully professional wasn\u2019t yet an option: She juggled her playing career with working in a sports shop and later as a teacher. The top-tier Danish Women\u2019s League remains semi-professional. In 2013, her father, one of her biggest supporters, was diagnosed with cancer. \u201cAt that time, my world was just broken down,\u201d she says. Despite being selected for Denmark\u2019s squad in the 2013 Euros, she dropped out before the tournament so she could be at her father\u2019s bedside when he died.  \u201cFamily is much, much more important than football,\u201d she says. \u201cI stopped [playing] for three months because I couldn\u2019t go on the pitch without my dad.\u201d Troelsgaard has since worn the No 51 shirt as a tribute to her father, his year of birth. \u201cEvery time I go on the pitch, I think about my dad.\u201d Troelsgaard moved back home for a few years, living with her family and playing for Kolding IF. Then came an offer she couldn\u2019t refuse: the chance to play for the professional Swedish side FC Roseng\u00e5rd, where she stayed until 2021. \u201cBefore that, I just had been a full-time worker in a school in Denmark,\u201d she says. \u201cThen, after two weeks, I was standing in the Mini Camp Nou in Spain playing against Barcelona [in the Champions League].\u201d It was, she says, a \u201ccrazy two weeks for me\u201d. For years, Troelsgaard had her sights set on the Women\u2019s Super League, signing with Reading in 2021. She made her debut for the club four days after moving to the country, while living in a hotel. \u201cIt was huge for me that I\u2019d just come on the team and then I was in the starting XI,.\u201d  Looking back on her career, Troelsgaard, 34, puts her success down to sheer graft: \u201cWorking hard is my talent,\u201d she says. She describes one of her biggest achievements as making her debut for Denmark in 2008, having initially not made the Under-19s squad. \u201cI think that\u2019s one of the highlights in my career, that if you just believe in yourself, then you can dream big.\u201d She went on to win Denmark\u2019s player of the year award in 2011 and has 171 caps. Her next major goal is to make the Denmark squad for the World Cup this year, while maintaining her form at Reading. \u201cI have more responsibility on the pitch, I have scored some of the goals, of course I want to continue it that way,\u201d she says. Troelsgaard is aware she is at the tail end of her career, but she isn\u2019t ready to give up playing, despite various job offers. She says: \u201cI just tell the people: \u2018I\u2019m not finished yet so just come back in a couple of years and we\u2019ll see.\u2019 But, hopefully I can be something in football \u2013 that\u2019s my dream.\u201d Naturally, she hopes to keep up her online coaching, too. Troelsgaard says she has a lot left to give. \u201cI still develop as a football player each day and also as a person.\u201d With a smile, she adds: \u201cMy body still thinks I\u2019m 20 years old, so I think that\u2019s a good sign.\u201d Get to know the players in England\u2019s top flight better with our WSL player in focus series.

A menace across the pitch, and it was sad to watch her hobble off injured with minutes left. 9  Theresa Fitzpatrick Great work with ball on the boot opened England\u2019s defence. Read of play was spot on throughout. More impressive in attack than defence. 7 Portia Woodman Winger was forced off at 18 minutes after Lydia Thompson put in a dangerous tackle with head-on-head contact. She went off on a cart but was OK to pick up her medal. N/A Ruahei Demant (capt) Player of the final. Pressured a Harrison kick to go out on the full which led to winning try. Dependable and inspirational leader. 9 Kendra Cocksedge Last game in a New Zealand shirt with her retirement announcement coming before tournament. Ever solid at nine with fairytale ending to boot. 7 Phillipa Love Hooked off before 50 minutes after being pushed around by England\u2019s front row at the scrum, had more control when replacements came on. 6 Georgia Ponsonby Same as Love, had issues at the set piece with both scrum and line-out but scored from a driving maul. 6 Amy Rule Scored a really good try, spotting Amy Cokayne had moved to defend the driving maul and peeling off to go over. 8 Maia Roos Knock-on under a high ball led to England\u2019s third try but balanced it out with good work at maul time. 7 Chelsea Bremner Scrum sloppy in the first 40 but back on track in the second. Good defensive effort from a player who worked well in the background. 7 Alana Bremner Similar to her sister in toiling away to get the little things right. Scrum not always functioning, an issue in the first half. 7 Sarah Hirini Was not mentioned much in commentary but ever present in attack and defence, heart of team celebrations. Could have better set piece. 8 Charmaine McMenamin Had a good game after starting for injured teammate Liana Mikaele-Tu\u2019u, replaced early.

England Ellie Kildunne Great under high ball, scored opening try with great pace and had to work hard in defence after Lydia Thompson red card. 8 Lydia Thompson Completely misjudged tackle on Woodman saw her off under 20 minutes \u2013 a reckless, dangerous manoeuvre and the right decision by referee Hollie Davidson. 2 Emily Scarratt Missed a few kicks but instrumental in first try. Good offloading and won breakdown penalty, decided to go for corner with last play of the game. 7 Holly Aitchison Kick charged down but a good distributor alongside Zoe Harrison, didn\u2019t have a real impact on the match defensively but solid. 6 Abby Dow Did not get enough ball to display her skill, made great break in second half but could not shine as she did in the semi-final. 6 Zoe Harrison Mostly good kicks but a few went out on the full, most notably one that led to New Zealand\u2019s winning try. 7 Lucy Packer Thrown in at the deep end, not initially named in starting 23 but late call-up played well. Controlled the ball, great England future ahead. 7 Vickii Cornborough Solid scrum skills winning valuable penalties and defensive work good. Huge stint to play almost 80 minutes, same for rest of front row. 8 Amy Cokayne Hat-trick hooker and brilliant at line-out time. Set piece was sloppy after she was replaced, massive player for her team. 9  Sarah Bern Put in crunching tackles, big carries and made some desperate metres. Great scrummaging and mauling kept England in the game. 8 Zoe Aldcroft Forced off just under half an hour into match with a HIA which she subsequently failed, played well while on. 6 Abbie Ward Ever the menace at the line-out but lost a few, including the last which sealed their defeat, great in the maul. 7 Alex Matthews Knocked on in an unlucky position, titan in defence, scrummaging skills top notch. 11 years in the shirt, dependable as always. 7 Marlie Packer Scored her sixth try of the tournament, turned over the ball at the breakdown. Stunned to see her replaced so early, good performance. 8 Sarah Hunter (capt) Replaced at half-time after what had been an impressive performance, mainly through her captaincy. Down to 14 but ahead at the break. 7 Replacements: Lark Davies (for Cokayne, 74) 5; Maud Muir (for Cornborough, 74) 5; Shaunagh Brown (for Bern, 74) 5; Cath O\u2019Donnell (for Aldcroft, 28) 6; Poppy Cleall (for Hunter, 40) 6; Sadia Kabeya (for M Packer, 51) Huge potential for future 7; Claudia MacDonald (for L Packer) 7; Tatyana Heard (for Dow, 67) hooked off after Dow passed HIA at 78 minutes 5."

                    "body": "Reece James has been ruled out for eight weeks with a knee injury, leaving the Chelsea and England wing-back\u2019s hopes of going to the World Cup hanging by a thread. James went off during Chelsea\u2019s 2-0 win over Milan at San Siro last Tuesday and the initial signs were that he had not suffered serious damage. However the 22-year-old received bad news after undergoing further tests on Thursday and is expected to be out for a significant period.  James visited a consultant on Saturday and the decision has been taken for him not to have surgery. But the right-sided player, who has been in outstanding form for club and country this season, still looks highly unlikely to go to Qatar. England\u2019s opening group game is against Iran on 21 November. The fact James stayed in Milan for an extra day and flew back to England on an easyJet flight on Wednesday night suggests he was not worried about the injury at first. He paid for extra legroom and it is understood that taking a budget flight did not cause any further damage. But James is still facing up to the prospect of not going to the World Cup. Losing him would be a major blow for Gareth Southgate, who finds himself with a selection headache on the right of his defence. Manchester City\u2019s Kyle Walker, who can play at right centre-back and right back, is a major doubt after undergoing groin surgery, and Liverpool\u2019s Trent Alexander-Arnold has an ankle problem. As it stands Kieran Trippier would be in line to start on the right against Iran. The hope for James will be that he is able to prove he will be fit in time for the knockout stage. Having a 26-man squad gives Southgate extra wriggle room with injuries. Southgate took Harry Maguire to Euro 2020 despite him being injured for England\u2019s first two games. James\u2019s absence is also a blow for Chelsea, who visit Aston Villa on Sunday. Graham Potter\u2019s side have also lost N\u2019Golo Kant\u00e9 and Wesley Fofana to injury. A hamstring injury is set to keep Kante out for the rest of the year, meaning that the France international is out of the World Cup. France are also likely to be out without Fofana. The \u00a369.5m defender suffered a knee injury against Milan earlier this month. In better news for Chelsea, Mason Mount is expected to be available against Villa after a scan on a thigh problem revealed nothing serious. "

However, this mistake aside, the 30-year-old Ryan has been in superb form all tournament.\nGrabara, who is part of Poland\u2019s World Cup squad as an injury replacement but has not played a single minute, was quick to jump on Ryan\u2019s heavy touch that allowed Juli\u00e1n \u00c1lvarez to score in the second half of the 2-1 round-of-16 loss.\n\u201cMust have been politics, for sure,\u201d he tweeted, followed by a smirk emoji intimating Ryan had lost his club starting spot because of his lack of ability.\nRyan learned about the tweet after the game and told media: \u201cI\u2019m not surprised with you to be honest. But, yeah, his opinion doesn\u2019t really concern me.\u201d\nSocceroos teammates and coach Graham Arnold were quick to support Ryan after the loss, which ended their World Cup campaign, though the player himself conceded \u201cit hurts a lot\u201d.\nRyan said the backline had been told to play out from the back with the view it would help them \u201cpenetrate [Argentina] further down the field\u201d, though they emerged from half-time with increased impetus and \u201ctactically put a bit more together in terms of how they wanted to come and press us\u201d.\n\u201cI tried to adjust as quick as I could and copped a little bump there,\u201d he said. \u201cMaybe I could have tried and milked a foul there or something in hindsight, or put my foot through it. The modern way of playing, and playing out from the back, you\u2019ve still got to find the right balance of doing that and knowing when to get yourself out of danger.\n\u201cI haven\u2019t seen a replay but I\u2019ll analyse it and I can only learn from it. We learn from our hardships in life and it\u2019s definitely one for me. It hurts a lot, but I won\u2019t let it get the better of me or define me. I\u2019ll come back stronger for it.\u201d\n\nRyan recovered and went on to make a number of saves in a frenzied final 20 minutes, during which Australia scored after Craig Goodwin\u2019s shot took a heavy deflection off Enzo Fern\u00e1ndez.\nArnold leapt to Ryan\u2019s defence post-match, saying \u201ceveryone makes mistakes, he\u2019s been a fantastic captain and fantastic player\u201d, and was joined by teammates.\n\u201cMaty has saved our bacon more times than I can think,\u201d said defender Kye Rowles, who could be seen comforting Ryan after full-time. \u201cAnd he did it after [the mistake] as well, making multiple saves that kept us in the game so we could keep fighting.\u201d"

                    "body": "Brazil 2-0 USSR, 1958 The young Pel\u00e9 knew how to make a first impression. He scored four goals on his unofficial debut for Santos. He scored one on his official club debut, his goal-tending victim very much looking at his fate through the prism of a glass half full, later making a business card announcing his status as the keeper who conceded Pel\u00e9\u2019s first. He scored within minutes of coming on for his first Brazil cap. But the true harbinger came in Brazil\u2019s third group game of the 1958 World Cup. Thought too callow by some of Brazil\u2019s coaching staff, Pel\u00e9 and Garrincha sat on the sidelines as they watched the team beat Austria and draw 0-0 with England, the latter the first time the Sele\u00e7\u00e3o had failed to score in a World Cup game. That relative failure was enough to force the hand of the coach, Vicente Feola. He threw in the inexperienced duo and after 40 seconds Garrincha hit a post. One minute later, so did Pel\u00e9. The woodwork wasn\u2019t the only thing rattled: the USSR team, one of the pre-tournament favourites, were so discombobulated they shipped a goal to Vav\u00e1 another 60 seconds later. \u201cThe greatest three minutes of football ever played,\u201d said the L\u2019\u00c9quipe journalist Gabriel Hanot, the founder of the European Cup. The most epochal, too, given what Pel\u00e9 and Brazil would get up to during the next dozen years.  Brazil 5-2 Sweden, 1958 Pel\u00e9 didn\u2019t go on to win the 1958 World Cup for Brazil singlehanded \u2013 Vav\u00e1, Didi and Garrincha would have had something to say about that \u2013 but the legend has become fact, and it stands up well enough in its own right anyway. He scored the only goal of the quarters with a blistering chest-and-volley against Wales. He notched a hat-trick in the semis against France, the pick of the bunch a juggle-and-volley into the bottom corner. He scored two in the final against Sweden, including a precocious flick-and-volley over the confused head of Bengt Gustavsson. Had another shot not hit a post, he\u2019d have been celebrating another hat-trick. The young man, overwhelmed at the final whistle, wept tears of joy. At 17 years and 249 days, he is still the youngest player to win a World Cup and to score in the final, 19-year-old Kylian Mbapp\u00e9, France\u2019s emerging hero of 2018, positively geriatric by comparison. He\u2019s still the last man to score a hat-trick for Brazil at a finals, too.  Benfica 2-5 Santos, 1962 Pel\u00e9 wasted no time in making a mark on the 1962 World Cup. In Brazil\u2019s first game, against Mexico, taking a straight line between the point at which he took receipt of the ball and the goal, he beat six Mexicans plus the keeper before scoring, showcasing a combination of speed, power and skill that was so unusual back then. Sadly his groin gave way in the second match, against Czechoslovakia, and his tournament was over. But 1962 would still provide him with a career highlight. After the first leg of the Intercontinental Cup, his Santos side, the South American champions, held a slim 3-2 lead over their European counterparts, Eus\u00e9bio\u2019s Benfica. With the second leg in Lisbon, Benfica were confident of getting the job done and when Santos came to town they found banners proclaiming the hosts as \u201cWorld champions!\u201d (shades of Brazil\u2019s hubris before the 1950 World Cup decider against Uruguay, a fiasco little Pel\u00e9 would promise his distraught father to one day avenge), Fired up with pique, Pel\u00e9 scored another big-game hat-trick, one a tap-in, the other two breathtaking slaloms of grace and pace, as Santos routed their hosts 5-2. Pel\u00e9 would remember this performance as \u201cthe best game of my career\u201d and \u201ca piece of footballing art I\u2019ll never forget\u201d. Admittedly in his autobiography he laboured under the impression he\u2019d scored four, but he\u2019d more than earned the creative licence and the overall point stands. Brazil 1-3 Portugal, 1966 \u2026 in which our hero was kicked around Goodison Park like an old sock. Pel\u00e9\u2019s knee was mangled by the absurdly combative Portugal defender Jo\u00e3o Morais, the champions were out in the groups, and Pel\u00e9 announced his retirement from the international game. \u201cThere is a new style of play coming into favour in Europe,\u201d noted Brazil\u2019s medical adviser, Dr Hilton Gosling. \u201cI do not think it will give as much pleasure to the public as we have tried over the last eight years. It seems inevitable now that we shall have to put more emphasis on the physical side of the game and concentrate rather less on technique.\u201d A career low, but what happened next wouldn\u2019t be half the story without it.  Brazil 4-1 Italy, 1970 Pel\u00e9 quickly recanted but was considered a busted flush going into Mexico 70. By the team coach Jo\u00e3o Saldanha, anyway. A former player turned journalist, Saldanha was a leftfield appointment and somewhat eccentric: he announced that Pel\u00e9 was going blind and should be dropped, got into a row over selection with the country\u2019s despotic president, Emilio M\u00e9dici, and when criticised in the press by his predecessor, Dorival Yustrich, went looking for him in a hotel lobby armed with a loaded pistol. Saldanha, having pushed his luck in spectacular style, was quickly replaced by M\u00e1rio Zagallo, Pel\u00e9 was reinstated, and the rest \u2013 the near miss against Czechoslovakia from the halfway line, the embrace with Bobby Moore, the circumvention of Uruguay\u2019s keeper, Ladislao Mazurkiewicz, in the semi \u2013 is elegant history. The pi\u00e8ce de resistance was, naturally, the final against Italy, the 5ft 8in Pel\u00e9 leaping into the thin Azteca air to head the opening goal, then the greatest assist in history, a blind pass rolled into the path of the in-flight Carlos Alberto just so. The very moment that football exploded into a riot of brash technicolour and still the greatest World Cup moment of all. Brazil 4, New European Style 1.  New York Cosmos 2-1 Santos, 1977 \u2026 in which our hero goes to the land of opportunity, becomes the world\u2019s first true global superstar, wins the 1977 NASL Championship for the New York Cosmos, preaches \u201clove love love\u201d live on ABC television after scoring a valedictory 30-yard free-kick against his old team in his final match, and hangs around Studio 54 in a white suit. All hail the King. Love, love, love. "

                    "body": "All it took was one little slip. After five minutes Rapha\u00ebl Varane moved out of defence, scanning for options, and rolled the ball down the inside-right channel, luring Jawad El Yamiq forward, pulling the Morocco defender out of position and kidding him into thinking that he could snuff the danger out.\nThere was a problem. Clarity arrived quickly, a realisation that something bad was about to happen, a sense of dread falling over Morocco as it became apparent that El Yamiq had made the error of gambling and losing track of Antoine Griezmann.\nIt was not ideal. Suddenly, before they had settled into their first World Cup semi-final, Morocco were in the Griezmann zone, scrambling to cover as the France No 7 turned and found Kylian Mbapp\u00e9, Achraf Hakimi made a block and the ball looped to the left for Th\u00e9o Hernandez to fire the opening goal past Yassine \u201cBono\u201d Bounou.\n\nAh. In a stadium packed out with their supporters, Morocco found themselves in unfamiliar territory: picking the ball out of their own net, behind for the first time in this World Cup. For France, it seemed the perfect scenario: an opportunity to lure desperate opponents in and then run riot with the pace of Mbapp\u00e9 and Ousmane Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 on the break.\nOnly, the longer the game progressed, the harder it became to work out how France keep getting away with what, to the naked eye, looks like the bare minimum. Within minutes of going behind Morocco were hitting back, Azzedine Ounahi nipping in behind the inexperienced French midfield and drawing a fine save from Hugo Lloris. Moments later Olivier Giroud was giving the ball away in midfield, then spraying an easy pass out for a throw. Over on the right, Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 simply looked lost and forlorn.\n\nAnd at times it was even tempting to ask a ridiculous question: are France, defending world champions, slight favourites going into Sunday\u2019s final with Lionel Messi\u2019s Argentina, actually any good? Is someone going to work them out? Is Lionel Scaloni going to expose Didier Deschamps as a pragmatic fraud?\nThere is certainly encouragement for Argentina to take from how Morocco attacked France. Walid Regragui\u2019s side were fearless, fierce and rather brilliant. Before the game much had been made of whether Hakimi could win his duel with Mbapp\u00e9, his friend and Paris Saint\u2011Germain teammate. In Regragui\u2019s view, though, there is little point in building a bespoke anti-Mbapp\u00e9 plan. There was no special attention paid to France\u2019s star man, no tripling up on him (at times there was barely any doubling up), and after a while it became clear that Hakimi was determined to show why he is regarded as one of the best attacking right-backs in the world.\nWorking in tandem down the right flank with Hakim Ziyech, such a wonderful gliding presence, it was as if Hakimi had observed how conservatively England\u2019s Kyle Walker had played against Mbapp\u00e9 on Saturday and decided there was no point staying in his own half. Better to go for it. Better to charge forward, better to find the spaces behind Hernandez, better to make France worry about him.\n\nOf course, it meant taking risks. Midway through the first half Morocco left themselves exposed, Mbapp\u00e9 tearing into space vacated by Hakimi, Giroud shanking wide.\nMostly, though, the underdogs had France worried. There were surges from Hakimi, dribbles from Sofiane Boufal, Youssef En-Nesyri almost running beyond Ibrahima Konat\u00e9. With Adrien Rabiot unwell, the youthful midfield partnership of Aur\u00e9lien Tchouam\u00e9ni and Youssouf Fofana looked raw in the company of Sofyan Amrabat, who could be seen racing back at one stage to produce a thunderous challenge just as Mbapp\u00e9 looked ready to hit turbo speed.\nMuch like England, though, Morocco could not land any telling blows. El Yamiq hit a post with an overhead kick. In the second half, with France looking increasingly frazzled, crosses flashed across the box without anyone applying the final touch. There was also the moment Tchouam\u00e9ni dawdled in a dangerous position and lost possession to Abderrazak Hamdallah, who was unable to get his shot away.\n\nAt that point it was tempting to dwell on Morocco\u2019s lack of killer instinct. Or perhaps France had better players, more class, far more experience of competing at this level. They had Griezmann dropping back on the cover, Lloris\u2019s handling relieving pressure and Varane, so cool in central defence, helping Konat\u00e9 out of some tight spots.\nIt never quite felt that France would crack. There was no panic. They survived the sticky spells, held their shape and kept Morocco at bay, and they pulled clear with a goal that owed more to good fortune than skill, Randal Kolo Muani tapping in after Mbapp\u00e9\u2019s deflected shot ran into the substitute\u2019s path.\nIt was another flash of French ruthlessness. They are an odd side, content to play in bursts, happy to do just about enough and leave you wanting more.\nOn the other hand, barring another Messi masterclass, they are about to become the first country since Brazil in 1962 to successfully defend the World Cup. Are France any good? Does Deschamps know what he\u2019s doing? The eyes sometimes say no; the results say otherwise."

                    "body": "Graham Arnold praised the Socceroos for winning Australia\u2019s first World Cup match in 12 years but put a lid on celebrations, stating they had \u201cdone nothing\u201d yet before Wednesday\u2019s decisive final group fixture against Denmark.\nThe coach also bit back at critics, including former national team players, who have repeatedly questioned his selections and tactics, saying \u201cthey have no effect on my life\u201d.\nAustralia recovered from their opening 4-1 loss to France in emphatic fashion on Saturday, scoring early against Tunisia and protecting the 1-0 lead until the end. It was their first finals victory since defeating Serbia in 2010 and only the third after the 3-1 win against Japan in 2006.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the first clean sheet we\u2019ve held at a World Cup since 1974, which is crazy,\u201d Arnold said. \u201cBut it\u2019s just one game. Today obviously the opposition wasn\u2019t as good as the world champions but I felt that our performance, our fight and our grit and determination \u2013 the old Aussie way \u2013 was very important.\u201d\nAustralia outplayed Tunisia in a frenetic and physical first half in front of 40,000 mainly Tunisian supporters, outmuscling the same team that held 10th-ranked Denmark to a scoreless draw on Tuesday.\nThe grit paid off in the 23rd minute when Mitchell Duke headed home a cross from Craig Goodwin, before the defender Harry Souttar led the desperate second-half defence. The Tunisia coach, Jalel Kadri, said: \u201cDuring the first half, we did not perform the way we wanted to, Australia led us into playing a style we did not like. They dominated the game, created one chance and scored and unfortunately we could not equalise.\n\u201cWe changed tactics two or three times in the second half and created four or five chances but we were not clinical enough. They were very efficient in converting their chance.\u201d\nThe result keeps the Socceroos in the hunt to reach the last 16 for the first time since the golden generation did so in 2006. But Arnold, while acknowledging the historic achievement, said all the focus was on Denmark. \u201cI just said to them that the nation is extremely proud, but we\u2019ve done nothing,\u201d Arnold said. \u201cYou\u2019ve achieved something we can talk about after the tournament, but we are here to go as far as we can go.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want any celebration. Just enjoy this couple of minutes with the Australian fans here in the stadium then get yourself in the dressing room, ice baths, recover, and get ready for the next one. I don\u2019t want them sitting up all night looking at social media. It\u2019s about getting sleep, recovering well and being ready in the morning.\u201d\nThe win doubled as a statement for Arnold, who has polarised the nation since he took over from Bert van Marwijk after Russia 2018. The 59-year-old has previously put on a casual public front in the face of his critics, who include some former Australia players, but this time there was a bite to his tone. \u201cWho cares? They\u2019ve never coached,\u201d Arnold said. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen who was critical. Some of them have never even been to a World Cup. I don\u2019t listen to them. They have no effect on my life.\u201d"

                    "body": "And just like that, there\u2019s calm. For a perfect example of not judging a book by its cover \u2013 and, in this case, not forging your opinions based purely on results \u2013 have a look at Borussia Dortmund\u2019s start to 2023. Statistically it\u2019s been perfect but as with so many other trajectories BVB have mapped in the past, it hasn\u2019t been a straight line.\nThree weeks ago we might have expected their Champions League last-16 tie against Chelsea, which begins with at Signal Iduna Park on Wednesday, to be two well-heeled bald men scrapping over a comb. Yet if Graham Potter might need to draw consistent results from the mass of expensive talent assembled in the January transfer window, there are no such clouds darkening the Westfalen sky. Stability has always been what Edin Terzic has sough and now he seems to be finding it. Saturday\u2019s hard-fought victory at Werder Bremen was a sixth win out of six since German football resumed following the World Cup.\n\nThe mood has lifted and was further enhanced by this win in the north, chiselled out with a resolve that has not always been there. \u201cWe don\u2019t get stuck in negative things anymore,\u201d said Julian Brandt, after his stylish second goal sealed the deal. \u201cWe just keep going.\u201d There were moments that needed to be toughed out here, but BVB never looked like crumbling.\nIt\u2019s all such a difference not just to before Christmas \u2013 when they signed off for the World Cup break with successive deflating defeats by Wolfsburg and Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach that dropped them to sixth place \u2013 but to the resumption in January. The opening two wins of the current sequence, the 4-3 win against Augsburg and the late victory at Mainz were all but stolen, classic Dortmund manifestations of flashing moments of quality dragging their heads above the chaos.\nThat skittishness has given way to the beginnings of genuine resolve. This was a game they could have easily lost just a few months (and even weeks) back, against a home team boosted by successive wins who had already pulled the rug from under their opponents this season. Werder took their first three points since returning to the top flight in extraordinary circumstances in Dortmund back in August. Having trailed 2-0 as late as the 89th minute, Ole Werner\u2019s team pulled out a win for the ages, emerging 3-2 victors.\nIt was the mishap to outdo them all, and one which threatened to define Dortmund\u2019s season, another wasted campaign of promise undone by disorganisation. Yet recent results and performances have suggested a penny dropping. Terzic, a beloved and valued part of the club who many felt was simply not up to the job as the haphazard displays unfolded, is showing his teeth. His coaching is coming to the fore and it did again in Bremen, when he threw on Salih \u00d6zcan and Jamie Bynoe-Gittins midway through the second half, to simultaneously shield his defence and provide a touch of extra incision. Seventy-one seconds after his introduction, Bynoe-Gittins smashed in a left-footed shot at Jiri Pavlenka\u2019s near post and BVB were finally in business.\n\nMore than a lucky break, it showed Terzi\u0107\u2019s increasing comfort with taking tough decisions, replacing skipper Marco Reus \u2013 who had scored a first goal since September to win the DfB Pokal tie at Bochum in the week \u2013 with \u00d6zcan in a move that would have been deemed over-defensive had his team not used it as a platform to grab the game so instantly. To have Brandt, a player who has clearly been coached to a higher level by Terzi\u0107 having been thought of as a relative flop for much of the time since he arrived from Leverkusen in 2019, cap things off only underlined the point.\n\u201cJule has developed so much,\u201d said Terzic. \u201cHe is very fit, always one of our best runners and, at the moment, our most consistent player.\u201d Brandt has changed his diet, going gluten and dairy-free, and looks more durable and athletic, but he is also full of confidence and desire to take on responsibility. His flourishing in something akin to a No 10 role has even suggested that Reus, a club legend who is out of contract in the summer, may find himself squeezed out.\nIt isn\u2019t just Brandt who is excelling under the demands for higher standards. Emre Can, often cited as part of the club\u2019s problem in harbouring highly-paid, underperforming veterans, has been excellent since returning to the XI in place of \u00d6zcan, a talented holder who has been made to understand of late that inconsistency in his role just cannot fly - especially since that defensive midfield spot is vital in giving Jude Bellingham, the side\u2019s undisputed star, freedom to roam and bring his attacking gifts to bear.\nBVB do have a few issues ahead of the Blues\u2019 visit, not least the fitness of Youssoufa Moukoko, who limped off in the first half after being on the end of a heavy challenge from Leonardo Bittencourt and whose ankle injury \u201cdoesn\u2019t look too good\u201d according to Terzic. Meanwhile, Terzic must continue to use S\u00e9bastien Haller, so bright since his triumphant return from cancer treatment, sensibly, as the programme becomes more demanding.\n\nWhat bodes well for this week, though, is that Dortmund seem to be moving past their tendency to \u201cdo a Dortmund\u201d. Though they are only three points behind Bayern, nobody is talking about a title push \u2013 and those feet on the ground are exactly what Terzic and his team need to flourish.\n\nTalking points\n\nBetween Bayern \u2013 who cruised past Bochum 3-0 without setting the world on fire \u2013 and Dortmund \u2013 \u201cthe madness continues\u201d, in the words of Urs Fischer, his Union team in second place after a rousing comeback from a goal down to win in Leipzig. It was fired by Janik Haberer\u2019s rocket from outside the area to equalise Benny Henrichs\u2019 opener, setting Union on the way to a fourth comeback win in 2023. It is also worth noting that their total of 42 points from 20 games matches the total of Bayern\u2019s champion teams from 2019 and 2020.\n\n\n\nRemarkably it was joy all round in Berlin, with Hertha coming from a goal down to beat Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach 4-1 at Olympiastadion with three Berlin boys \u2013 Jessic Ngankam, birthday boy Marton Dardai and Derry Scherhant \u2013 all on the scoresheet to lift them out of the bottom two. The president Kay Bernstein talking of Hertha\u2019s youth being the future is one thing, but this was it made flesh.\n\n\nK\u00f6ln got Karneval season started in style, turning up the heat in the second half to beat Champions League high-fliers Eintracht Frankfurt 3-0 in a buoyant atmosphere. The outstanding Ellyes Skhiri, whose contract is running down and who turned down a move to Lyon in winter, scored twice, making him the Bundesliga\u2019s top scorer in 2023 and prompting a brief, terse exchange in the frosty press conference between coaches Steffen Baumgart and Oliver Glasner.\n\n"

                    "body": "I arrived in Europe with a sore tooth and World Cup fever. I left with a half-completed root canal and the unpleasant memory of shitting myself in a Barcelona club. The holiday had been planned for months: my family\u2019s \u201cboys tour\u201d through Russia for the 2018 World Cup, followed by a wedding in the sunny south of France. I had given myself a month after wisdom teeth removal before travel, expecting that I would have made a full recovery. What I hadn\u2019t counted on was the development of a dry socket \u2013 a horrendously painful condition when the clot that develops after a tooth removal is dislodged, exposing underlying bone and nerves. I was told it would be fine in a few days \u2013 a hilarious lie. Unable to drink booze, I spent the first night in Moscow hazy on codeine, miserably sipping borscht and watching crowds burst into nationalistic cheers. On my second day, I visited a dentist \u2013 the first of six. My then-boyfriend and I spent a sunny morning wandering the streets, helplessly refreshing Google Maps and entering random offices until we found our destination in a near-deserted shopping centre. I gave them $70. They packed my mouth with a medicated gel and gave me a script for drugs. We flew to Kazan, an old city on the banks of the Volga, to watch Australia lose to France. I vomited on the plane, sick from antibiotics and strange painkillers. Our apartment looked like a crime scene but there was a kind dentist a few doors down who I visited a couple of times, showing them a useful screenshot I had saved on my phone which translated from English to Russian. \u201cHello,\u201d it read, \u201cI have a dry socket after wisdom teeth removal. Can you please help me?\u201d The third dentist was in nearby Samara, during the second week of the World Cup. A woman in heels ushered me up four flights of stairs, gazed into my mouth, told me I had \u201cvery bad gum\u201d and gave me a script for painkillers banned in almost every country on Earth. Australia drew with Denmark. We flew to Nice, France. I was ecstatic to leave Russia, where my brother had downed shots of vodka and sung The Horses on pub tables with boozed-up locals while I spent hours Googling \u201cpainful dry socket forever\u201d, more acutely sober than I had ever felt in my life.  The dentist in France was a lovely guy with a charming accent, who didn\u2019t charge and told me it was OK to have a \u201cglass or two\u201d while on antibiotics, which I translated to \u201cget absolutely blind at the wedding\u201d. My then-boyfriend spilled red wine on my white dress, we toasted the bride and drove to Barcelona. I was, frustratingly, still in pain, which led to dentist number five. Dentist #5 wore a confronting red uniform and had a teenage receptionist on crutches. They told me I didn\u2019t have a dry socket, but needed a root canal. An hour later, I had a sheet pinned to my mouth and a dentist chipping gleefully away at my gums while chatting about football, as if I had capacity to reply beyond a vague moan. After weeks of antibiotics, I was more constipated than I\u2019d ever been in my life. But finally being off medication meant I could drink, so I took a laxative and celebrated with a few glasses of champagne. By midnight, I was standing in a club off La Rambla, unaware I had quite literally shat my pants, dancing like nobody was watching. But no longer constipated. We flew to Berlin. Dentist #6. They completed my root canal and cleaned my gums for good measure. It cost several hundred euros, but she gave me her card so I could \u201cvisit her next time I\u2019m in Berlin\u201d.  My trip\u2019s ending was on-brand. Our flight was delayed, which meant we missed our connection home from Munich. I arrived back in Australia just in time to make the dentist on Monday morning."

                    "body": "The Uruguay coach, Diego Alonso, blamed the penalty given to Portugal in their second group game for his side\u2019s exit from the World Cup. A 2-0 win over Ghana on Friday was not enough to take second place in the group, South Korea\u2019s victory over Portugal meaning they finished above Uruguay on goals scored. There was penalty controversy \u2013 again \u2013 in the game against Ghana, with two strong Uruguay appeals ruled out by the German official, Daniel Siebert, in the second half.  Uruguay\u2019s players furiously surrounded the referee at the end, continuing their protests on the way to the tunnel. Edinson Cavani, who was denied a late penalty, was booked for remonstrating with Siebert, and later shoved the VAR monitor to the floor on the way back to the dressing room. During the game, Federico Valverde had run up to Siebert to celebrate after Andr\u00e9 Ayew had a first-half penalty saved for Ghana, while there were also protests after Darwin N\u00fa\u00f1ez was brought down by Daniel Amartey in the box. Afterwards, though, Alonso was more exercised about an incident in the previous game, which Uruguay lost 2-0 to Portugal. Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Gim\u00e9nez fell in challenging Bruno Fernandes, the ball striking his hand as he did so. Ifab\u2019s guidelines specifically state that that should not be given as a foul but the VAR official, Abdullah al-Marri of Qatar, instructed the Iranian referee, Alireza Faghani, to review the decision. Faghani gave the penalty from which Fernandes made it 2-0; had that game finished 1-0, Uruguay would have gone through. \u201cWe are out because of the penalty for Portugal and what it did to the goal difference,\u201d Alonso said. \u201cThat was awarded but according to Fifa was not a penalty.\u201d Exactly what communication there has been remains unclear.  Cavani could face further action from Fifa after a clip emerged on social media on Friday, showing the forward striking out at the pitchside VAR monitor on his way back to the dressing room. Several Uruguay players had earlier followed Siebert down the tunnel at full-time, before returning to the pitch to applaud their supporters and reflect on a disappointing early exit. \u201cI would have liked to see this version of Uruguay before but this is what happened,\u201d Alonso went on. \u201cI don\u2019t have anything to say to my players: they broke their backs and gave their best selves. Everyone can see what happened in previous match.\u201d He said it was too early to talk about his future, but the Ghana coach, Otto Addo, is leaving the national team. \u201cWhen I started last year,\u201d he said, \u201cit was clear that I would stop after the World Cup. My family and I see my future in Germany. We are very happy there. I said when we qualified that I would resign after.\u201d Addo urged fans not to blame Ayew for missing the penalty. \u201cThere is nobody who hasn\u2019t missed a penalty,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople who don\u2019t know much about football will give that person the blame.\u201d"

                    "body": "\u201cYou\u2019re going home in the morning,\u201d came the chorus from the England supporters after Marcus Rashford fired in an early second-half free\u2011kick and again, a little bit louder, when Phil Foden doubled their advantage 98 seconds later. It was salt into the wound for the bank of Wales fans at the other end \u2013 six\u2011and-a-bit blocks of the Red Wall \u2013 for whom a first World Cup finals in 64 years has turned out to be a rather dispiriting and demoralising experience. Was it really worth the wait? Gareth Bale will no doubt ponder the same question in the coming days.\n\nBale, who appeared to alert medical staff to a hamstring problem with about 10 minutes of the first half to play, was substituted at the break. Three weeks ago, on the day Rob Page announced his squad, the Wales manager conceded that whether Bale could handle three games in quick succession was the million\u2011dollar question, for which we now have a resounding answer: 256 minutes across eight days was simply too much for a player who has played such little football over the past few years. The painful truth is Bale\u2019s three World Cup appearances comprise three duds. At the final whistle Bale limped on to the pitch, embraced Page and then Gareth Southgate.\nBale had seven forgettable touches and completed one pass in 50 first-half minutes \u2013 and that was back towards his own defender about 10 yards from the Wales goal-line. Despite starting in his favoured position on the right flank, Bale again appeared to be running on empty, immobile and somehow, despite all of his past grandeur, reduced to a pawn on a chessboard of kings and queens in a dull first half, in which Kieffer Moore had Wales\u2019s only shot on target. At one point Page quickly fed Bale the ball on halfway. Bale took a long throw in search of Moore, who flicked the ball on in the hope of locating Aaron Ramsey, who would wear the captain\u2019s armband in the second half.\n\nPage said if Bale returned for the second half he would have been playing at about 70%. Quite what percentage he was operating at in the first half is anyone\u2019s guess, with Page\u2019s hollow insistence Bale \u201cput in a big shift\u201d hard to comprehend.\nThings did not improve. But for 38 minutes, believe it or not, Wales were actually only one goal away from reaching the last 16. But then Christian Pulisic scored against Iran and half an hour later Wales\u2019s ludicrously slim hopes of advancing to the knockout stage were in tatters. By the time Ben Davies was forced off through injury approaching the hour, Wales were in a real mess.\nConnor Roberts was exposed at left-back, Ethan Ampadu, arguably the best of a bad bunch as far as Wales performances in Qatar go, filling in at right-back. Joe Morrell, hardly a regular for Portsmouth in League One, joined the midfield alongside Joe Allen, who started his first game since September.\nEngland, meanwhile, introduced starters from Manchester City, Liverpool and Newcastle.\n\nBale\u2019s withdrawal brought the arrival of Brennan Johnson and within seconds the 21\u2011year\u2011old Nottingham Forest forward provided Wales with a welcome thrust. Finally, there was some intent, even if it came to nothing. Johnson gave Luke Shaw a bump as he set off to race on to a lofted pass and the referee, Slavko Vincic, awarded a free-kick. A few minutes later Johnson\u2019s neat back\u2011heel flick close to halfway helped the ball on to Ramsey for a lesser-spotted Wales attack.\nThe Wales centre-back Chris Mepham acknowledged his side would have to take the handbrake off if they were to have any chance of recording a first win against England since 1984, and Page took the decision to switch system, ditching the three-man defence for the first time since September last year.\nPage even seemed determined to keep Southgate and the England staff guessing, with Joe Rodon, Davies and Mepham warming up as a back three, while Neco Williams and Daniel James lined up as wing-backs.\n\nTo say Wales were suddenly free of all inhibitions here would be pushing it, mind. Davies shifted to left\u2011back and Ramsey and Bale roamed behind Moore \u2013 often nowhere near the striker \u2013 but the England goalkeeper Jordan Pickford was a spectator throughout. James, reduced to a 5ft 7in trier, was also totally lost. Before dropping a shot wide of a post in the second half, his main contribution was giving John Stones a whack on the shins.\nWales exit with Bale\u2019s penalty, which salvaged an unlikely draw against the USA, their only goal and after bruising defeats by Iran and England. The Wales fans who made it to all three of their games here must be sick of the sight of the Ahmad bin Ali Stadium.\nWhere do Wales go from here, and with whom exactly? Page has said his senior players have promised him they will not all retire in one swoop and Bale insists he will stick around for the Euro 2024 campaign. Ramsey, too, will seemingly carry on. A few minutes after the final whistle the 2,500 or so Wales supporters launched into a stirring, a capella version of Hen Wlad Fy Nhadau, with Bale, Allen and the rest of the squad visibly moved, but that represented one of few moments from Qatar to cherish."

                    "body": "The UK\u2019s high court has denied a request by Qatar Airways to force Airbus to keep building A321neo jetliners for the airline as part of a wider public $1bn (\u00a3786m) bust-up that has implications for other future multibillion-dollar jet deals. The preliminary ruling by a UK judge means the European plane manufacturer is free to market the popular smaller jets to other carriers, while the two sides remain locked in a separate disagreement over the safety of larger A350 jets. The 16-month dispute stems from claims made by Qatar Airways that peeling and cracking paint on the A350 aircraft made by Airbus poses safety issues in the event of a lightning strike. Airbus argues it is a maintenance rather than a safety issue.  In January, the Toulouse-based aircraft manufacturer revoked a $6bn deal for 50 single-aisle, short-haul A321neo jets in retaliation for Qatar\u2019s refusal to take A350s. This prompted the airline to take the case to the high court, arguing that the cancellation of the A321neo jet order was a breach of contract. The planemaker said it was pleased with the \u201ccourt\u2019s decision in recognising Airbus\u2019s position that a transparent and trustful cooperation is essential in our industry\u201d. It added: \u201cThe litigation is about the misrepresentation on the safety and airworthiness of the A350, which we will continue to defend, as well as the reputation of its operators and the rules governing aviation safety in the face of unjustified claims.\u201d It said it would monitor the court\u2019s decisions for the timetable on Tuesday. The court will set out a schedule that could lead to the case coming to trial, possibly during the football World Cup in Doha in November. Qatar Airways declined to comment. Airbus\u2019s decision to cancel the A321neo deal has alarmed some airlines, with the head of the industry body the International Air Transport Association, Willie Walsh, describing it as a \u201cworrying\u201d development. Walsh, the former chief executive of the British Airways owner IAG, said in January: \u201cI would hate to think that one of the suppliers is taking advantage of their current market strength to exploit their position, and that is something we are watching very closely.\u201d The chairman of Dubai\u2019s Emirates, Tim Clark, has said he is \u201cnot unsympathetic\u201d to its main Gulf rival, Qatar Airways, over the A321neo fallout. Airbus argues that the two contracts are connected by a \u201ccross-default\u201d clause that allows it to pull the plug on one deal when an airline refuses to honour the other. It has accused Qatar Airways, the A350\u2019s biggest customer, of airing invalid safety concerns over damage to the surface of the larger jets to avoid taking them at a time of weak demand, and to file a $1bn compensation claim. Qatar, for its part, says it was right to stop taking A350 deliveries over what it describes as genuine safety concerns. The concerns were raised by Doha\u2019s regulator over gaps or corrosion in a sub-layer of lightning protection exposed by cratered paint, which led the airline to ground 23 of its A350 fleet. It argues that the cross-default clause does not apply. Officials worry the A321neo case may set a worrying precedent, allowing disputes to ricochet from one contract to another, tightening the grip of aircraft makers Airbus and its US rival Boeing. \u201cPeople will look at this and take extra care to resist such cross-default clauses,\u201d the head of a large airline fleet told Reuters. Backed by European regulators, Airbus denies any A350 safety flaws, though it has acknowledged that paint peeling is a feature of modern carbon jets, which require repainting more often.  The problem has also affected other carriers, but Qatar is the only airline to have grounded the planes. Airbus says the planes have backup protections and the affected areas would have to be much larger to pose a hazard. Qatar Airways has said it cannot rule out such risks without deeper analysis from Airbus, and is unwilling to take any more A350s until the issue is resolved. Several industry sources say it is not in either side\u2019s interest to spark a full-scale public trial, which could produce a flood of further disclosures and test relations between France and Qatar at a time when Europe urgently seeks new gas supplies."

                    "body": "When it comes to analysing the loss to Italy in the final of Euro 2020, it is hard to get past the way England were forced to retreat as the game wore on and the battle for midfield supremacy began to tilt in the direction of Jorginho and Marco Verratti.\nIt is a familiar tale of woe. Ten years ago it was Andrea Pirlo completing more passes than the England midfield when Italy knocked them out of Euro 2012. The flaws were clear but little changed.\nThis is a tournament tradition \u2013 a thread that runs from Pirlo\u2019s masterclass in Kyiv to Ivan Rakitic and Luka Modric taking back control for Croatia in the semi-final of the 2018 World Cup \u2013 and it could trip up England again if they reach the later stages in Qatar.\n\nThe challenge is not lost on the players. There was no attempt from Declan Rice to hide away from the topic on Thursday. He remembers England losing their Nations League semi-final to the Netherlands three years ago. It was Rice\u2019s third cap and he has not forgotten Frenkie de Jong dominating midfield for the Dutch, who fought back from a goal down to win in extra time.\n\u201cMy time against De Jong, I was really young,\u201d Rice said. \u201cI was only 19. I said at the time he was a really special player. If I want to be one of the best I need to test myself against the best. And as a central midfield group in England, if we want to be one of the best we need to win midfield battles.\u201d\n\nRice has developed since facing De Jong. West Ham\u2019s captain is one of the most commanding midfielders in the Premier League and has become an automatic starter for England, who meet Senegal in the last 16 on Sunday. It is not a surprise Chelsea, Manchester City and Manchester United will battle to sign him next summer.\nEven so, it was tough for Rice and Kalvin Phillips when they took on Jorginho and Verratti last year. Are England geared to take on that kind of deep-lying playmaker? They made a fast start in that final, taking an early lead through Luke Shaw, but Roberto Mancini\u2019s tactical tweaks changed the game.\n\u201cWhen you play against the better nations they are always going to have top midfield players,\u201d Rice said. \u201cThey are going to have players that control games and it\u2019s about how we can counteract that.\n\u201cItaly had an extra man in midfield because we set up with a back five, so it was hard to get pressure on the ball. It was hard to get up to the ball because they would pop it off and get you out of your slot. It\u2019s about learning and being that coach on the pitch yourself.\u201d\n\nThe hope is that England will be more prepared if they face Adrien Rabiot and Aur\u00e9lien Tchouam\u00e9ni of France in the last eight, or the Spanish midfield of Gavi, Pedri and Sergio Busquets later down the line. The quality is there. Rice offers power and poise in front of the back four. He was excellent when England drew with Germany in September \u2013 Joshua Kimmich and Ilkay G\u00fcndogan were second-best that night \u2013 and has developed a solid understanding with Jude Bellingham, who has made the midfield less predictable.\n\u201cWe\u2019re learning really well together,\u201d Rice said of his partnership with Bellingham. \u201cThere\u2019s been a lot of goals he\u2019s scored this year where he\u2019s made that late run into the box. He\u2019s really added that to his game. [Frank] Lampard was the best at it, arriving really late. He\u2019s really starting to show that now.\u201d\nListening to Rice, it was clear why he is regarded as a leader. No question fazed him. He raved about Marcus Rashford \u2013 \u201chis speed, his eye for goal, the way he hits the ball, it\u2019s really special\u201d \u2013 and took on Mason Mount\u2019s social media critics.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t need to talk too much about Mase,\u201d he said. \u201cHe just doesn\u2019t fit the agenda of what people want an attacking midfield player to look like. He is one of the best players I\u2019ve played with. He is such a team player, such a hard-working, honest guy.\n\u201cSometimes people online just don\u2019t like him. For what reason, I honestly don\u2019t know. His numbers for Chelsea are incredible.\u201d\nThe spirit in the camp is good. Rice spoke about the camaraderie in the squad and laughed about adopting Chesney Hawkes as a lucky mascot after the singer\u2019s half-time performance during England\u2019s win over Wales.\nBut it was not all fun and games. This is a big moment for Rice. He pushes forward for West Ham but he is England\u2019s anchorman. It is on him to win the ball, set the tempo and plug the gaps when Harry Maguire steps out of defence; to perform the kind of job Busquets still does so well for Spain. Above all, it is on Rice to learn from past failures. England cannot afford to lose another midfield battle."

                    "body": "The saga of the OneLove armbands that were going to be worn by a number of team captains has been annoying and frustrating from start to limp finish. In many ways, the clamp down by Fifa on the wearing of them is ironic, too, because everyone within the federations who put together this show of support has worked hard to build a new OneLove brand almost to detach from the rainbow, to dilute and depoliticise an issue that is unavoidably political.\nThe whole episode was disappointing because even the most watered-down attempt to show that football should be an inclusive and welcoming space was too much. For Fifa to threaten players and the federations for trying to promote a symbolic message of unity, togetherness, tolerance and inclusion goes against all the values and principles that it says it stands for and wants to promote as the global governing body of the game.\nThere have been plenty who have argued that players, fans and federations should \u201cstick to football\u201d and that \u201cwe should respect the culture\u201d of the host nation, but this shows a fundamental misunderstanding of the issues. If we accepted segregation as part of the culture of a place or time then we would still be living with anti-interracial marriage laws and who knows what else.\n\nArguing this is the liberal west trying to impose its values and principles on a country and a competition that don\u2019t want it also hugely negates the lived experiences of any LGBTQ+ players competing in the tournament, as well as the LGBTQ+ fans in the stands. Perhaps most criminally, it also lets down representatives of the LGBTQ+ communities within Qatar, who need global support and the platform of the World Cup to have a voice about what\u2019s going on for them and the freedoms they\u2019re fighting for.\nThe accusation that it is racist to discuss these issues because it shows a lack of respect for Qatari or Islamic culture is wrong, but there has been a tinge of racism regarding discussions. In many forums the narrative becomes that this is the uncultured Middle East v the progressive west, but that undermines the issues and leads to whataboutery. We should not be coming across as holier than thou but acknowledging that problems can exist all over the world, in all societies, at the same time.\nIn Britain we have a lot of issues. I would argue that rising homelessness and people not being able to afford energy is also a human rights abuse, that people should not have to be suffering in the way they are because of the negligence of the government.\nAll of these things can exist at the same time. I can be critical of our government, our country and the way things are operating here as well as being critical of other countries. Human rights abuses and discrimination should not even be up for debate. It should be a given that you take an ethical and moral position on these issues, but at the first sign of a pushback from Fifa the federations folded.\n\nThere are huge pressures on players. Many don\u2019t just support themselves financially but their extended families, too. And there is a real feeling of powerlessness. There is a feeling that whatever they do, nothing will change. That is why federations need to take a stand, as governing bodies but also in supporting their players\u2019 voices.\nIf everyone gave up at the first hurdle in the fight for freedoms and equality, then where would be today? Look at John Carlos, Tommie Smith and Peter Norman, who stood on the 200m podium at the 1968 Olympics and risked everything \u2013 Smith and Carlos raised their fists in support of the Black Power movement, with all three donning badges in support for the Olympic Project for Human Rights.\nIt\u2019s a sacrifice, and sometimes it is a personal sacrifice, but the long\u2011term effect and the impact that acts of solidarity or protest can have are far reaching. We should be taking pride in the position we want to stand on and should be reflecting on how we want to be seen in the next 100 years.\nThe decision to set the armbands aside in the face of sporting sanctions is incredibly weak and stands in stark contrast to the actions of the players of Iran. They have risked being disowned by their own nation, their own government and put themselves, their families and their friends in potential danger by not singing the national anthem before the game against England in support of the protests back home. They understand, though, that the World Cup is a platform and an opportunity to bring global attention to a very important and critical issue within their own country. That shows courage and strength and it should empower others.\n\nIf a women\u2019s team had been put in the position of the teams involved and been threatened with sporting sanctions, I feel like the response would have been different. Why? Because as women we\u2019ve been used to having to sacrifice and make difficult choices just to be able to play football, even when we know there\u2019s a consequence. Indeed, the two people to wear the armband despite Fifa\u2019s condemnation have been women \u2013 the former England international Alex Scott and Germany\u2019s interior minister, Nancy Faeser.\nThe Germany players covering their mouths in protest against the threat of sanctions and a number of federations and players speaking out strongly against the pressure to not wear the armband should be applauded, but it\u2019s not enough. Every day, migrant workers, women and LGBTQ+ people put their lives on the line just by existing in Qatar. Not being able to stomach sporting sanctions in that context is incredibly weak."

                    "body": "Paul Tierney blew his whistle, the ball dropped out of the sky and was grabbed by Tim Ream, and history was made as the Premier League, for the first time ever, broke for the World Cup. The final game before the six-week shutdown was an enjoyable romp that culminated with that most familiar of tropes, a last-minute Manchester United winner, slid in by the 18-year-old substitute Alejandro Garnacho. A crisp evening by the Thames. The bells of All Saints welcoming the throng through Bishops Park. Smoke rising from the fast-food vans into the chill, clear air. The trees an autumnal gold. In the morning, a gentle mist had hung over the river, perfect for the old maids to cycle through on their way to holy communion. It was the sort of November day that has made trips to Craven Cottage so evocative since it first became the home of Fulham in 1896. It certainly was not the sort of day to make you feel as though, a week less half an hour after kick-off, the World Cup would be getting under way.  Of all the issues raised by this World Cup, perhaps the least important is the way it has disrupted the rhythm of European seasons. There have even been suggestions that some teams may not be taking the Carabao Cup entirely seriously. Yet it has had an impact, as the number of players already ruled out of or in danger of missing out on the World Cup makes clear. There has never before been a gap of fewer than 16 days between the Champions League/European Cup final and the start of the World Cup; for there to be less than seven days between the end of domestic action and the start of the tournament inevitably augments the sense of football as a remorseless treadmill, fixture after fixture following in endless, accelerating succession, and can only increase the issue of fatigue. The result was a distinct last day of term feel about Fulham, of this somehow lacking the dread earnestness of most match days. Uniform guidelines were perhaps relaxed, some of the younger classes brought in games, there were squabbles in the staff-room over the one working video recorder and the tape of the Tom Hanks film Big, and nobody really bothered too much with the boring stuff, like defensive structure or playing the safe pass. The result was a very open and thoroughly engaging game that swept from end to end with exhausting intensity. There was certainly no obvious sign of players holding back. Nor was there any suggestion that the absences of five players who could have major roles to play at the World Cup \u2013 Cristiano Ronaldo, Rapha\u00ebl Varane, Antony and the suspended Diogo Dalot for United and Aleksandar Mitrovic for Fulham \u2013 were down to anything other than bona fide issues, but the shadows they left contributed to the air of vague abandon. Harry Maguire, lionheart of the England back three, at least should be fully rested, having spent the evening on the bench; he has played just 90 minutes of Premier League football in the past two months. Yet this was a game of consequence. The win took United to within three points of fourth-placed Tottenham with a game in hand; the gap to Champions League qualification looks manageable. The absence of Ronaldo is of increasingly little concern to United. United have lost half the Premier League games he has started this season, averaging just a point a game, as opposed to 2.2 per game without him. United\u2019s opener was finely constructed, evidence of the sort of football Erik ten Hag is looking to instil \u2013 and the reason why he eschews Brazil\u2019s first-choice holding midfield pair to deploy Christian Eriksen alongside Casemiro. The Brazilian dispossessed Tom Cairney after 14 minutes, Eriksen then setting Anthony Martial running before advancing to slide in Bruno Fernandes\u2019s cross at the back post. The player who was missed was Dalot, the combination of Willian and Antonee Robinson repeatedly troubling his stand-in Tyrell Malacia down the Fulham left. Sure enough, that was where the Fulham equaliser originated, the duo combining to lay in Cairney to cross for the United old boy Dan James, who had been on the pitch just three minutes, to turn in.  There was still almost half an hour plus injury time to play at that point and, for a time, until the introduction of Garnacho restored some thrust to the United attack, Fulham looked the likelier to score. But it was United who, in the third minute of three minutes added time, grabbed the winner, the Argentinian drifting in from the left, exchanging passes with Eriksen and nudging his finish past Bernd Leno. And then, poof, it was gone, the excitement doused, the stands emptied, the floodlights turned off to make way for Fifa\u2019s shameful folly in Qatar, not to be reignited until Boxing Day."

                    "body": "At 76, Sir Graham Henry says the final whistle has now sounded. One of the most decorated coaches in rugby history has hung up his tracksuit and is heading into the retirement sunset on the idyllic Waiheke Island. His last hurrah was last Saturday\u2019s women\u2019s World Cup final across the bay in Auckland where, as a consultant with the Black Ferns, he duly signed off with another momentous victory. If it feels like the end of an era that is exactly what it is. Henry coached the All Blacks to 88 wins in 103 Tests \u2013 his record against England read played nine, won nine \u2013 and guided them to the 2011 World Cup title. He was World Coach of the Year five times and also coached Wales and the British &amp; Irish Lions. If anyone is qualified to discuss the health \u2013 or otherwise \u2013 of modern rugby union he is very much the man.  Which is why everyone should sit up and listen when he suggests the game has an increasing problem. \u201cI think the rolling maul has got out of hand, personally,\u201d he says, taking a contemplative sip of his mocha. \u201cIt\u2019s becoming such a significant part of the game that teams are working to get penalties just so they can drive a five metre lineout and score. That\u2019s probably not a very appealing part of the game for the spectator.\u201d Henry has been involved in top-level coaching for 30 years \u2013 having coached in schools for two decades before that \u2013 and needs no reminding that rugby is a contact sport that can be approached in myriad ways. His issue is that some sides are starting to do little else and are causing neutrals to lose interest. \u201cPerhaps in England the number of spectators looks after itself because of the size of the population but in this part of the world it doesn\u2019t.  \u201cThey\u2019re struggling to get people along to watch the games. I think the rolling maul is a negative part of the game from a viewing point of view. It\u2019s very hard for the defensive side to stop it. I think it\u2019s a part of the game we could look at and say, \u2018Can we make this a greater contest?\u2019\u201d It is also his belief that encouraging players to tackle slightly lower is crucial to the game\u2019s future popularity, not least at community level. \u201cI would drop the tackle height below the sternum. It will free up the ball and there\u2019ll be a lot more offloads, which will make it a better game to watch. I think the focus on tackle height has already been a real positive.\u201d Henry\u2019s perspective has been sharpened by his time with the Black Ferns, who beat England 34-31 to retain the world title at Eden Park. \u201cPeople have enjoyed the women\u2019s game because it\u2019s a bit slower and they can appreciate more what people are trying to achieve. The men\u2019s game today is brutal, isn\u2019t it? It\u2019s so bloody quick, you\u2019ve got so many big, strong athletes and the field hasn\u2019t got any bigger. People have actually said to me, \u2018I\u2019ve really enjoyed the women\u2019s games because I can see what\u2019s going on.\u2019\u201d It has also made him wonder if the men are taking themselves too seriously. \u201cWhat I like about the Black Ferns is that they\u2019re so passionate about the game. Women\u2019s rugby is about enjoyment. The result is important but it\u2019s not the be-all and end-all. It\u2019s important we maintain that and don\u2019t make it like the men where it becomes a job.\u201d His recent insights into gender psychology \u2013 \u201cthe girls need to feel good to play and the boys need to win to feel good\u201d \u2013 has also confirmed his view that he made a few misjudgments early in his Test coaching career, not least in delivering earnest team talks that his players did not need.  Footage of the septuagenarian dancing with the Black Ferns at training \u2013 \u201cNo, it hasn\u2019t improved my dancing \u2026 mine has to be wind assisted\u201d \u2013 is conclusive proof that good coaches can still learn new tricks. \u201cWomen are very self-critical. They knock themselves a lot and they want to get it right. As a coach it became more of a job of building their confidence and being really positive. Perhaps I should have learned that when I was coaching the men.\u201d From now on, though, the departing guru will follow big games such as Saturday\u2019s Test at Twickenham mostly from afar. \u201cI watched Wales play the All Blacks in Cardiff. I\u2019ve got so many fond memories of that place. It\u2019s my second home and I really loved my time there.\u201d He also senses Europe\u2019s leading teams are on the march. \u201cThe game in Europe has improved immensely. When I watched France last year I thought they were bloody scary. Ireland? They\u2019re probably the most organised side in the world and they embarrassed our fellas in July. They played bloody good football and deserved to win. \u201cThis could be one of the most competitive World Cups. There\u2019s half a dozen sides who could do well in 2023. Ireland, France, England, New Zealand, South Africa \u2026 and I think Australia too. But Ireland have been very impressive and I\u2019m sure by the time the World Cup comes around that England will be knocking on the door. \u201cI\u2019d imagine, like any World Cup team, they\u2019ll be trying to finalise their team and develop some new strategies. Originality is important. You\u2019ve got some great brains in the game these days and they\u2019re all thinking about how to get an edge. You can\u2019t do what everybody else is doing. You\u2019ve got to think and maybe not show too much yet. But I think France are the favourites. They just need to play a bit more rugby together.\u201d Henry may be walking away but lifelong rugby coaches never entirely switch off."

                    "body": "There\u2019s a perception that working in the media is glamorous, especially when it comes to covering massive cultural and sporting events. Well, my first involvement with Glastonbury as a journalist was live-blogging it from an office, and it\u2019s an absolute pleasure to be bringing you coverage of the World Cup from my kitchen. As someone who is, according to Qatari World Cup ambassador Khalid Salman, \u201cdamaged in the mind\u201d, this is probably for the best.\nUsually, watching the home nations from the home nations during big tournaments means bagsying pub\u2011garden tables alongside fans with England flag face-paint sweated off into strawberry swirls. The Tartan Army teaming tracksuit tops with kilts. Wales supporters quoting Michael Sheen\u2019s rousing speech from A League of Their Own. And, though we\u2019ve collectively tried to forget, observing men with flares up their arses.\nNot this time. This time, despite being indoors, I am watching the football wearing a beanie hat. It is dark outside. In Doha it is 28C; here it\u2019s 7C. But, though much about this tournament is unfamiliar, one thing will never change: the great BBC versus ITV debate. Which has the better title credits? Who are the best pundits? Will a co-commentator butcher a player\u2019s name to levels not seen since John Travolta called Idina Menzel \u201cAdele Dazeem\u201d? It\u2019s a competition in itself. The ad-free Beeb often routs its commercial rival, but Euros 2020 (aka Euros 2021) saw a standout ITV performance \u2013 though was thumped in the viewing figures when the broadcasters went head-to-head in the final.\n\nOn Monday afternoon the BBC brought us England\u2019s debut against Iran, although the channel\u2019s coverage had kicked off on Sunday with the tournament\u2019s opening ceremony. Or rather, not with the tournament\u2019s opening ceremony \u2013 which was relegated to iPlayer.\nInstead Gary Lineker, Alan Shearer, Alex Scott and Ashley Williams focused on criticism of the host nation. The rife corruption surrounding its bid; the abhorrent treatment of migrant workers who built the stadiums; LGBTQ and women\u2019s rights, or lack thereof. Lineker\u2019s will probably be the most shared opening monologue since Emily Maitlis\u2019s Newsnight evisceration of the government\u2019s handling of the pandemic. Naturally, many on Twitter bemoaned that Lineker and co, employed by the British Broadcasting Corporation, were hypocrites for \u201ctaking the Qataris\u2019 money\u201d. Which once again makes me consider that universal franchise should be replaced with some kind of basic aptitude test.\nFor the England game it was Rio Ferdinand and Micah Richards who joined Lineker and Shearer on the tournament\u2019s muted set, decorated white and what I would describe as burgundy but people will email in to say is maroon. A complete contrast, then, to the title credits produced by Edinburgh-based Studio Something who presumably were all off their face on drugs at the time. I quite like them. They\u2019re raucous and boldly coloured, and a grinding chant of HERE WE GO means that every single grandparent in the country will mute them instantly. Speaking of noise, thankfully the squeaky chair issue of the previous evening had been fixed.\n\nThe big talking point of the day was how Fifa had threatened teams who had planned to wear the OneLove armband with a booking \u2013 clearly Gianni Infantino no longer felt gay. The teams backed down. Scott displayed class when she wore the armband pitchside at half\u2011time, talking to Kelly Somers. (Never mind that the OneLove armband is quite crap \u2013 just wear an actual full-rainbow armband if you want to show solidarity; but to then not wear it because it might be punitive, which is literally how sticking to principles work, is quite something)\nGuy Mowbray and, in my opinion, the unfairly maligned Jermaine Jenas were in the commentary booth, and did well given the game was stopped for approximately 94 hours when the Iran keeper Alireza Beiranvand was left prone on the turf after a horrific clash of heads with his defender. Mowbray winced and declared: \u201cI don\u2019t think we need to see that again\u201d, as the director replayed it from four angles. The rest of their job \u2013 and that of the in-studio gang \u2013 was a doddle, given that England scored an excellent six goals and put in a good performance all round.\nITV made its bow with the day\u2019s second fixture: Senegal against Louis van Gaal\u2019s Netherlands. I watched on ITVHub which \u2013 along with people who write \u201cthank you\u201d as one word \u2013 has served as the bane of my existence. I don\u2019t really know about the sort of torture metered out to dissenters in various autocratic countries around the world, but forcing them to watch ITVHub would be a good shout. This time, however, it worked fine for me, and a source tells me (ie, my friend Josh) that the newer, sleeker ITV X also behaved.\n\nITV\u2019s titles were kind of sweet, if a bit random. An animated sequence of teams making their way to the desert, variously via rowing boat (England), super\u2011yacht (Cristiano Ronaldo, obviously), horses, hot air balloons etc. In reality, it has been private jets flying to an event which has a carbon footprint of 3.6 million tons. The studio set design had continuity from the titles, bringing over the hot air balloons to its backdrop. But the balloons over undulating sand dunes was giving Windows screensaver vibes, or the pre-set photos on a Canon.\nLaura Woods, hosting, was joined by Nigel de Jong, Ian Wright and Gary Neville (who has had criticism for taking actual Qatari money for his work with BeIn Sports). All were proficient analysers before kick\u2011off and at half\u2011time, but the real treat was the commentary. On duty were champion duo Jon Champion (sorry) and Ally McCoist. Champion and McCoist team up for the odd Premier League game on Amazon Prime, and they are an indefatigable joy. McCoist is so enthusiastic about everything, has such golden retriever energy, that, during what was objectively a game drier than the Khor Al Adaid, Champion ventured so tentatively: \u201cI know you\u2019re enjoying the nuances, but am I allowed to say it\u2019s been slightly pedestrian?\u201d McCoist conceded that it had been.\nTo wrap up, and sticking with ITV, Gareth Bale led the charge for Wales against USA. Two teams who had also broken their pledge to wear the OneLove armbands. Bravo for Eni Aluko\u2019s pro-take on the armband, and for Roy Keane who, when asked by the host Mark Pougatch about the situation, said: \u201cI think the players could have worn it for the first game, that would have been a great statement.\u201d Also in the studio was the former Welsh international Hal Robson-Kanu, with Clive Tyldesley and John Hartson on comms. Perfectly serviceable on an evening which brought a 1-1 draw for Rob Page\u2019s men, but a bit of a comedown after the exuberance of McCoist.\n\nIf this World Cup feels weird and uncomfortable enough as it is \u2013 and here it should be made clear that Qatar isn\u2019t the only nation that treats migrants appallingly, hello to Southampton fan Rishi Sunak \u2013 the experience of watching on the sofa with a hot water bottle and an Earl Grey tea, instead of a deck chair and a cool glass of something clinking with ice, just isn\u2019t the same. McCoist would still be happy, though.\n\u2022 This article was amended on 23 November 2022. Michael Sheen gave his rousing speech for the Welsh football team on A League of Their Own, not The Last Leg as an earlier version said."

                    "body": "In a combative press conference performance reflecting the tensions of Belgium\u2019s troubled World Cup campaign, Roberto Mart\u00ednez accused the French media of dirty tricks and the Belgian press of seeking to divide their country before the must\u2011win match against Croatia.\nBelgium, third at the last World Cup and second in the world rankings, must beat the 2018 finalists on Thursday to avoid a humiliating early exit from Qatar. Their preparations have been shrouded in acrimony. L\u2019Equipe claimed Kevin De Bruyne and Jan Vertonghen clashed in the dressing room after Sunday\u2019s 2-0 loss to Morocco, with the veteran defender taking exception to the Manchester City playmaker\u2019s claim in the Guardian that Belgium are too old to win the World Cup.\nEden Hazard was reportedly also involved in the incident and Romelu Lukaku stepped in as peacemaker. \u201cI guess we attack badly because we are also too old up front,\u201d Vertonghen allegedly said.\n\nTimothy Castagne, the Belgium and Leicester full-back, said De Bruyne\u2019s comments were discussed during a team meeting on Monday but denied they had contributed to two poor performances and that the meeting constituted crisis talks. Belgian media had reported the meeting in those terms, along with claims that several big-name players are not on speaking terms.\nThibaut Courtois, who will make his 100th appearance for Belgium on Thursday, described the stories as \u201cinvented lies\u201d to destabilise the squad. However, the Real Madrid goalkeeper also claimed that if the identity of the dressing room mole is discovered \u201cit\u2019s his last day in the national team\u201d.\nMart\u00ednez continued with the siege mentality approach, accusing Belgian media of doubling down on \u201cfake news\u201d emerging from France. \u201cWe were not happy with the two performances,\u201d said Belgium\u2019s head coach. \u201cThen you see the storm on the outside and realise that maybe we were listening too much to the outside noise before the tournament.\n\n\u201cNow we have some outlets in Belgium that are quite happy to jump on fake news. That\u2019s quite astonishing.\n\u201cA World Cup is the biggest sporting event in the world and you could see maybe a country like France did a very good job with a story that became the main topic of conversation in Belgium. It showed there is maybe more desire to find negative news around this team than to really get this nation together and support this team and enjoy the talent of the best generation we have ever had in Belgium football.\n\u201cThat was probably a lesson for all of us \u2013 that we are here on our own and we are here to fight for what we believe is the way we want to play and hopefully the fans \u2013 the real fans \u2013 of the Red Devils can enjoy the process.\u201d\n\nMart\u00ednez believes the bust-up story will fuel Belgium\u2019s motivation against Croatia, who require a point to progress to the last 16. \u201cWhoever has done it has scored a great own goal for Belgium,\u201d he said. \u201cIf I could weaken opponents as a journalist I would do that. Whoever has done it is a genius.\u201d\nCastagne gave a brutally honest assessment of their performances at the World Cup, admitting they played with fear against Canada and Morocco and had lost confidence. \u201cIt\u2019s true we let the criticism affect us to a certain extent,\u201d he said. \u201cMaybe we heard people saying we weren\u2019t a golden generation and we started asking questions and doubting ourselves. Perhaps lost some of the confidence we had. That\u2019s why the meeting was important.\u201d\nThe defender described Monday\u2019s meeting as \u201cgetting things off our chest\u201d and not a slanging match. De Bruyne\u2019s ageing comments were on the agenda. Castagne said: \u201cWe had a meeting to thrash these issues out. I don\u2019t think Kevin meant anything bad by what he said.\n\u201cItaly won the Euros last year with [Leonardo] Bonucci and [Giorgio] Chiellini in defence, so age is not always a factor. I don\u2019t think we should target one or two who maybe are not playing to the best of their ability. If we look in the mirror we all know we could have played better. I don\u2019t think age is a factor and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s because of what Kevin said that we played badly. We\u2019ve sorted out those issues and everything is fine now within the camp.\u201d\nCroatia\u2019s head coach, Zlatko Dalic, said his team would not play for the draw they need and expect to meet a side that lives up to its lofty reputation, complete with Lukaku starting his first game of the tournament.\n\u201cBelgium are a great team and in truth I would not have chosen this to be our last, decisive game of the group,\u201d Dalic said. \u201cThe game will not be fought by media stories or rumours. We will be playing a top team with phenomenal players. You don\u2019t become a bad team overnight. It will be more difficult than Morocco and Canada. We respect Morocco and Canada but Belgium are a class above them.\u201d"

                    "body": "\nThe main event\nIt took a while for an Asian team to make a mark at the World Cup. Indonesia were the first to compete at the tournament, trading as the Dutch East Indies in 1938, and were battered 6-0 by eventual losing finalists Hungary. The next Asian side to make it fared even worse. In 1954, South Korea were mauled 9-0 by the Hungary side of Pusk\u00e1s, Kocsis and Czibor, then belted 7-0 by a Turkey team that would go on to lose 7-2 against West Germany, who in turn were thumped 8-3 by Hungary in the groups before beating them 3-2 in the final. Strange old tournament, 1954.\nBut when Asia finally did hit, they hit big in 1966. North Korea started their campaign in what was then considered the trademark Asian style, going down meekly 3-0 to the USSR. They were as good as out before Pak Seung-zin became the first Asian to score a World Cup goal, salvaging a draw with a couple of minutes to spare against Chile. At which point all hell broke loose. The Koreans saw off pre-tournament favourites Italy at Ayresome Park \u2013 Pak Doo-ik going down in history \u2013 then went three up in 24 minutes against Portugal, before Eus\u00e9bio restored the old old-world order. England, Eus\u00e9bio, North Korea: the three big takeaways from 1966, and good luck getting everyone to agree which story was the greatest ever told.\nSince that big breakthrough, it\u2019s been slim pickings for Asian sides. A plethora of group-stage exits and the occasional visit to the round of 16 \u2026 with one notable exception: co-hosts South Korea\u2019s planetary-axis-bothering run to the semi-finals in 2002, the highlight surely Ahn Jung-hwan getting the better of Paolo Maldini to score the golden goal in the very last act of the great defender\u2019s international career. Probably for the best that VAR wasn\u2019t about for the Spain game, but fourth place is fourth place, whichever way you turn it.\n\nThis time, however, it feels like tectonic plates are shifting. The Asian federation sent six representatives to this World Cup, a total boosted by Qatar\u2019s host status and Australia (yes, yes, but administrators gotta administrate) seeing off Peru in a qualification playoff. The continent has collectively seized its chance to shine. With Qatar the miserable exception, everyone has chipped in. Iran\u2019s defeat of Wales was one borne of pride, verve and bravery, sporting and political. Saudi Arabia pulled off an all-ages stunner against Lionel Messi and Argentina. South Korea eased dark horses Uruguay out of the running with a dramatic never-say-die winner against Portugal. Japan did pretty much all they could to double-whammy both Germany and Spain out in the groups; for three or four minutes back there, it was on.\nAfter all that, another couple of brave last-16 exits would be something of a damp squib. For those taking history as their guide, Croatia and Brazil will end Asian resistance later today, the same old, same old. But factor in the here and now \u2013 that Croatia\u2019s superannuated side, \u201cknackered\u201d by their own admission, may be no match for Japan\u2019s hard press; that in Son Heung-min, South Korea have an attacker as dangerous and productive as anyone Brazil can field \u2013 and nothing is beyond the realms. Seismic shocks if the five-times winners and 2018 finalists are dispatched? Ignore the concomitant hoo-hah; they\u2019d be medium tremors at best.\nAlso consider that none of the big teams have performed consistently in Qatar, never mind proved themselves infallible. Should Japan and South Korea make it through today, they\u2019ll play each other in the quarters. And then what? Well, why not. It\u2019s been a long time coming, but the World Cup could finally be Asia\u2019s oyster. SM\nTalking points\nCash\u2019s position-change was on the money\u201cI remember being told I was playing right-back in a pre-season friendly and I didn\u2019t want to do it,\u201d Matty Cash said after Sabri Lamouchi moved the player from central midfield to defence at Nottingham Forest. The Frenchman had seen something in the youngster than meant he could excel on the right-hand side. Cash had looked a competent midfielder in the Championship but never a certainty for Premier League football. His fitness and commitment makes him a wonderful right-back, possessing both attacking and defensive qualities, attributes Aston Villa paid \u00a316m for. No one could have predicted a few years ago that Cash would be going toe-to-toe with Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 at a World Cup playing for Poland. In the last-16 defeat he impressed with his industry and reading of the game. It just goes to show that young players should be open-minded about their futures, regardless where they have played throughout their youth. WU\n\nBellingham shows why he is most wantedThere is almost certainly no team in world football who would not wish to have Jude Bellingham in their midfield. His arrival as an England player has helped release the handbrake that Gareth Southgate\u2019s critics frequently speak of, his cruising speed through midfield turning a punishing first half \u2013 in which Senegal had been the better team \u2013 into a 2-0 half-time lead. Bellingham has long been linked with Liverpool, and were they to find the funds to buy him from Dortmund, would surely supplant Jordan Henderson. For now, the two are international teammates and Bellingham laid on the Liverpool captain\u2019s opener. Their face-to-face shared celebration resembled stags locking horns, and Henderson\u2019s part in it resembled some kind of transfer-window mating ritual to tempt the young tyro to Merseyside. How Liverpool fans must hope they will see the pair celebrate together in a red shirt. JB\n\nBeyond the football\nFor the past quarter-century or so, if you wanted to hear a thoughtful voice discuss the intricacies of football\u2019s place in the wider world you couldn\u2019t go far wrong with Ars\u00e8ne Wenger. These days, though, Fifa\u2019s chief of global football development seems to adopted a rather less nuanced outlook. Talking about the teams to have suffered shock early exits, Wenger diagnosed the common problem: they were distracted by politics. \u201cThe teams [who went through] were mentally ready and had the mindset to focus on the competition and not on political demonstrations,\u201d he said. Disappointed in the great man? You and us both.\n\nMeanwhile, where\u2019s Doha\u2019s best party at this World Cup? Go underground, on the bustling concourses and carriages of the city\u2019s Metro system. It\u2019s where fans congregate in a strange world of gleaming metal, driverless trains and gold-class lounges. But it comes with a hidden dark side. The $36bn project is blighted by the 2016 death of labourer Juanito B Pardillowho according to reports had been helping to excavate a tunnel while it was raining when it collapsed, something that went against safety rules. Four others were injured. They were part of an estimated 18,000 workers working for a construction contractor on the project at the time. AH\nGlobal media-watch\nIn Argentina, former international Diego Latorre wrote in La Naci\u00f3n that Lionel Messi\u2019s performance against Australia \u201cwas his best ever\u201d in a World Cup and without him the win \u201cwould not have been possible\u201d. The former Boca Juniors forward said, unsurprisingly, that Messi was the difference in a tough last-16 tie. Messi was helped by his teammates playing to his strengths to make up for their own inadequacies. They will be hoping he can do the same in the quarter final against Netherlands on Friday.\nThere was success for Netherlands as they defeated USA on Saturday, although the Dutch press has some concerns about the team. Telegraaf warns we have seen \u201cnot a shadow of the Frankie de Jong we know\u201d about the central midfielder. There was more positive news for the Dutch team with Louis van Goal being titled \u201cthe World Cup counter king\u201d, thanks to his team\u2019s attacking style that saw them rip through the USA at times. WU\n\nThe internet reacts\nLionel Messi is a pavement artist who sees shapes before others, according to Barney Ronay, but surely even he didn\u2019t paint this picture of the UK in his head while leading Australia\u2019s defenders a merry dance \u2026\n\n\nAnd Arsenal fans have been an untimely blow by the news Gabriel Jesus has been ruled out of the tournament. Despite their team being five points clear at the top of the Premier League, Gunners supporters were notably dismissive of their side\u2019s chances of winning a first title since 2003, even before this. RB\n\n\nToday\u2019s matches\nJapan v Croatia (Round of 16, 3pm GMT, BBC1)Japan have surprised everyone at this World Cup \u2013 perhaps even themselves \u2013 and their tussle with Croatia presents an intriguing clash of styles. At their best, Hajime Moriyasu\u2019s men play an intense, expansive, hyperactive brand of football, doing everything quickly, and it is this which has made them such difficult opponents. Croatia are a more studied affair, slowly strangling opponents thanks to one of the world\u2019s best midfields, with Luka Modric\u2019s genius ably supported by the all-round excellence of Marcelo Brozovic and Mateo Kovacic. What the teams share, though, is an indefatigable mentality: Japan have come from behind to beat both Germany and Spain, finishing above both \u2013 an absolutely ludicrous effort \u2013 while Croatia are now a staple of tournament knockout stages. Chances are, Croatia shade a close one \u2013 but they\u2019ll be wary of Japan, who\u2019ve proved yet again the old adage that speed kills. DH\n\nBrazil v South Korea (Round of 16, 7pm GMT, ITV1)Though few predicted victories for South Korea against Portugal or Cameroon against Brazil, both came over much-changed teams. While momentum is hard to obtain and easy to lose, Brazil are favourites for a reason: they are a settled, cohesive outfit with options on the bench. Most likely, South Korea will defend deep to try and stay in the game while hoping to finagle a goal from somewhere \u2013 most likely a counter \u2013 or hang on for penalties. Brazil, though have the knowhow and composure to keep at it should they not score early, and one way or another, class should eventually tell. DH\nPlayer to watch\nCasemiro It feels slightly odd \u2013 slightly wrong, even \u2013 to look at a team with as much attacking talent as Brazil and pick out a defensive midfielder. However, while Casemiro is a defensive midfielder and not just one of the best in the world but one of the best of the generation, he is also so much more than that. Though we don\u2019t always see it, we certainly have in this competition \u2013 he was one of the stars of the group stages, as much for his passing and shooting as for his tackling and running \u2013 and it is no coincidence that Brazil\u2019s defeat to Cameroon came in his absence. But he will be back for the knockouts, and if he maintains his current form, his team will be very hard to stop. DH\n\nAnd finally \u2026\nDuring the latter period of Louis van Gaal\u2019s career, his teams have been famously unentertaining. But inspired by their manager\u2019s recently recovery from cancer, the Netherlands are improving \u2013 Memphis Depay\u2019s opening goal against USA was a thing of beauty. And even if they revert to more staid type against Argentina, Van Gaal remains as fun and engaging a personality as ever \u2013 as this video, taken when his squad returned to their hotel after their last-16 victory, encapsulates beautifully.\n"

                    "body": "It was hard to put your finger on it but there was a different feel to this year\u2019s Six Nations launch. Perhaps it was the Netflix cameras around every corner seeking to project rugby to a wider global audience. Maybe it had something to do with Eddie Jones no longer being around to stir the media pot. There was even a solo acoustic guitarist serenading the hacks as they munched their lunch, which was unquestionably a first. Or maybe, just maybe, it was a sign of a professional sport making a concerted effort to raise its game. One by one the head coaches of the competing nations stepped up to the microphone and spoke with intelligence and candour. Contentious subjects such as the new waist-high tackle trial in England were openly addressed rather than swerved. And the next few weeks, everyone agreed, would be unmissable.  The unspoken reality is that this is rugby\u2019s big chance to shine. With a huge World Cup looming in France this year, the game has never had a better chance to capture floating voters or the uninitiated. Of course there are sobering player welfare issues to resolve but, equally, there could hardly be a more enticing championship in store. Get things right now and the future could soon be much brighter. The new England head coach, Steve Borthwick, spoke particularly well, not least about his desire for his players to have no regrets. \u201cAs a player I was privileged to play 57 times for England. I had the great honour of captaining my country on 21 occasions. Now I look back and I regret a lot of the things I didn\u2019t do. I always put the effort in but did I ever feel I put all my strengths on the pitch? Did I ever feel I gave the absolute best of myself? Would I like to rewind the clock and try and do it again? Yes, I would.\u201d As a direct consequence, he wants his England players to make a conscious effort to seize the moment. \u201cI want to help these young guys not make the mistakes I made. When they\u2019re old and have no hair like me, I want them to not have regrets. I don\u2019t want them looking back thinking: \u2018I wish I\u2019d done that.\u2019 Let\u2019s do it. One thing I\u2019ll promise you is we\u2019re going to make mistakes. But whether we win or lose I want us to be better the next week. I\u2019m going to be authentic and not play mind games. I\u2019ll leave that to other coaches.\u201d Borthwick, though, did concede that transforming England might not happen overnight given the strength of many of their rivals. While his side kick off with two home games against Scotland and Italy, Jones\u2019s abrupt departure has left his successor little time in which to reinvent the wheel. \u201cThe reality is we\u2019re a little bit behind. You saw that in the autumn. Every English supporter wants this England team to perform better than they did then. I also sense a hunger among the players to get back out and put some things right.\u201d Warren Gatland, who won a grand slam in his first season in charge of Wales in 2008, also suspects there could be a \u201cnew coach bounce\u201d for England given the depth of resources at their disposal. \u201cI always think England should be one of the top two or three teams in the world,\u201d Gatland suggested. In almost the same breath, though, he made clear his view that Wales, with some senior players back, can also improve markedly on their own November struggles. \u201cIf you ask them to run through a brick wall the question they\u2019ll ask is: \u2018What do you want us to do when we get to the other side?\u2019\u201d  There will be no shortage of motivation, either, as far as France are concerned. The defending grand slam champions have some injury absentees but their head coach Fabien Galthi\u00e9, rocking a strong white trainers and dark glasses vibe for the cameras outside County Hall in London, is adamant his side will not be resting on their laurels in the coming weeks. \u201cAre we defending a trophy or going for a trophy?\u201d he asked rhetorically. \u201cThat\u2019s the question we\u2019re asking ourselves.\u201d The visit of Les Bleus to Dublin in round two could well be a pivotal fixture but Ireland\u2019s Andy Farrell and Johnny Sexton are already challenging their team to embrace the hype attached to their official ranking as the world\u2019s best team. \u201cThe pressure\u2019s more internal than anything but if the pressure from outside starts to seep in it\u2019s good for us to have to deal with that,\u201d said Farrell. \u201cWe want to get better for what\u2019s down the track, for obvious reasons.\u201d Sexton, who will be fit to lead the side against Wales in the opening game in Cardiff, is also approaching his final Championship as a player with extra eagerness. \u201cIt\u2019s such a special tournament and so hard to win.\u201d Scotland, without a title since the final year of the Five Nations in 1999, are in similarly determined mood while Italy, the supposed also-rans, have defeated both Australia and Wales inside the past 11 months. Whoever wins this season\u2019s Guinness-sponsored tournament, it should be compelling viewing.  This is an extract from our weekly rugby union email, the Breakdown.

                    "body": "\u201cI\u2019m going to reach out to Panadol as my new sponsor because I\u2019m going to have quite a number of headaches to fit into a 26-man squad,\u201d Socceroos coach Graham Arnold said in the aftermath of his side\u2019s 2-0 win over New Zealand on Sunday afternoon. Delivered with a wry smile, it was a rehearsed gag that spoke to one of the biggest challenges the 58-year-old \u2013 and every other coach heading to Qatar 2022 \u2013 will face in the coming months.  Between now and 14 November, Arnold faces the mammoth task of weighing up a complex set of factors including, but not limited to, form, fitness, team chemistry, complementary skill sets and adaptability, to determine which players will realise the ultimate honour of representing their nation at a World Cup \u2013 and which will have their dreams dashed. And inevitably, even with squads extended to 26, instead of the normal 23, there\u2019s going to be more of the latter than the former. Forty-eight players were called up during the Socceroos\u2019 campaign to qualify for a fifth straight finals, without considering Sundays debutants Harrison Delbridge, Ryan Strain, Cameron Devlin, Keanu Baccus, Jason Cummings and Garang Kuol.  \u201cToday is not the last day for the players to get chosen,\u201d Arnold said. \u201cI want to make that clear. The boys have to go back to their clubs for seven weeks and they\u2019ve got to play and they\u2019ve got to be fit. They\u2019ve probably got to be the fittest they\u2019ve ever been.\u201d With his assistant Ren\u00e9 Meulensteen based in Europe, Arnold\u2019s next step will be to return to Australia for the start of the A-League Men season on 7 October, with domestically based players \u2013 behind the eight ball compared to their compatriots whose European leagues are already under way \u2013 to get six games to prove their worth before the squad is named.   It is in these fixtures that the two players with seemingly the most fan sentiment, Cummings and Kuol, will need to shine. The duo were unlikely to have secured a ticket to Qatar based on the New Zealand series alone, but they certainly could have ruled themselves out had they not put in head-turning cameos in the second half of Sunday\u2019s win. With Adam Taggart, Mitch Duke, and Jamie Maclaren seemingly entrenched, Cummings must excel in what appear a very manageable six games for the Central Coast Mariners to convince Arnold he needs four centre-forwards in Qatar. Kuol, meanwhile, may find himself up against Maclaren\u2019s Melbourne City teammate Marco Tilio for a place on the plane. Tilio, for his part, will need to fight for opportunities to impress as part of a crowded City attack in which he played only 53.6% of available match minutes last season. Daniel Arzani has endured a horror stretch since becoming 2018\u2019s bolter de jour, but his skill set means the now-Macarthur winger retains the tools to make a late run. In Japan, Thomas Deng, after arguably being the Socceroos\u2019 best on Sunday, will return to promotion-bound J2 League side Albirex Niigata with four games to impress. Able to play right- and centre-back, the 25-year-old\u2019s versatility will not only boost his late push even in the event Harry Souttar and Kye Rowles, ostensibly locks for selection if fit, return from injury, but will also add a wrinkle in the battle between Strain, Fran Karacic, and Nathaniel Atkinson on the flank. In Europe, a logjam of players shaping as the squad\u2019s future core will fight for a chance to provide depth to the already-crowded midfield of the present. Denis Genreau, Riley McGree, Connor Metcalfe, Cameron Devlin, and Baccus all need to seize their chance to go from Olympians to World Cup seniors under Arnold. Of course, for all this excitement and speculation, that is not to say some players are not \u2013 barring injury \u2013 all but formally locked in.  Arnold, speaking to AAP ahead of Sunday, said \u201c15 or 16 players\u201d had already cemented themselves in his plans and it is not too difficult to guess who some of these individuals are; mainstays Aziz Behich, Ajdin Hrustic, Jackson Irvine, Karacic, Awer Mabil, Maclaren, Aaron Mooy, Mat Ryan, Trent Sainsbury and Taggart were all given leave to depart camp after Thursday\u2019s game in Brisbane and return to their clubs.  But then there\u2019s another mainstay. Or, at least, a player who would normally be considered a mainstay: Tom Rogic. After seemingly falling off the face of the earth after withdrawing from the Socceroos squad ahead of their June play-offs, the mercurial attacker earlier this month resurfaced at West Bromwich Albion, signing at the Hawthorns until the end of the season.  When fit, Rogic \u2013 alongside Hrustic \u2013 is arguably Australia\u2019s most important reference point in possession, and Arnold has signalled he\u2019s ready to welcome him back into the fold, should he find form and fitness. If he can, Arnold\u2019s local pharmacy might need to stock up."

Wales, who salvaged a late draw against the USA on Monday, again struggled to stamp their authority and had Wayne Hennessey sent off on 86 minutes after he inadvertently wiped out the Iran striker Mehdi Taremi when attempting to clear the ball.\nPage said he would lift his players, many of whom crashed to the floor at full time, before Tuesday\u2019s final Group B match against England. \u201cWe can\u2019t sit and cry about it,\u201d the manager said. \u201cWe want to give our supporters something to cheer about. They have shown massive commitment to come over [to Qatar] and it really disappoints me that we\u2019ve given them that. We\u2019ll bounce back. We\u2019ll pick them up and go again.\u201d\n\nGareth Bale and Aaron Ramsey were among the Wales players who seemed to wilt in the intense afternoon heat before Iran prospered. \u201cWe weren\u2019t in the game at all,\u201d Page said. \u201cEven in the first half, before the sending-off \u2026 you can carry one or two players if there are off-days but, when the majority of the team are not quite at it, there is only going to be one outcome, unfortunately. It [qualifying] is out of our hands now.\u201d\nHennessey was initially booked for clattering Taremi as the striker latched on to a through ball before a VAR review led to his caution being upgraded. Page acknowledged his side were second-best.\n\n\u201cBefore the sending-off I wasn\u2019t happy with the performance,\u201d he said. \u201cThey hit the post twice, they had a goal ruled out for offside, which was marginal. We just couldn\u2019t get going in the game and that disappoints me the most. We fell well below the standards that over recent months have given us the success to qualify for the World Cup \u2026 when you do that in top competitions you get punished.\u201d\nCarlos Queiroz, Iran\u2019s head coach, said he was delighted with the way his players responded from their 6-2 thrashing by England. Queiroz dedicated the victory to Iran\u2019s fans, many of whom inside the stadium jeered his players singing the national anthem after they had remained silent during Monday\u2019s anthem.\n\u201cIt was very emotional but special because we rebounded from a difficult situation,\u201d Queiroz said. \u201cNobody likes to lose and, when you lose with those numbers, it is always a tough job. We went back to our roots. I think we played brilliantly. We wanted to give this gift to Iran fans. This game was a gift to the fans from the north, south, east, west \u2013 it\u2019s a gift to all of them.\u201d"

                    "body": "These, Gianni Infantino said earlier this week, have been the greatest group stages of all time. Unusually, he might be right (although his claim this was the most diverse last 16 is debatable at best). The football is only a small part of this World Cup but it has been largely excellent.\nThere have been some shocks, some favourites went home early, some played up to their pre-tournament billing and every group produced tension and intrigue. Infantino was conducting an in-house interview, hiding from journalists and accountability as he has since his bizarre address the day before the tournament began, which meant that nobody could ask the obvious question: if these group stages have been so good, why is he getting rid of them?\n\nThe 2026 World Cup in the USA, Mexico and Canada will have 48 teams. Initially, the plan had been for 16 groups of three with the top two going into a 32-team knockout, a terrible idea that invites collusion in the final group game, but Fifa has, thankfully, begun to reconsider.\nThe problem is that 48 teams is a bad number. It does not reduce easily to a power of two. Given eight groups of six would make the World Cup interminable, the likelihood is 12 groups of four, with the top two and eight best third-placed teams going through, a dismal compromise that leads inevitably to dead rubbers, doubly penalises teams in tough groups and advantages later groups whose potential third-place sides will know what they need to progress.\n\nIt is almost as if Infantino didn\u2019t take the decision for footballing reasons, but to play to his power base in Africa, Asia and Central America, who will now be allocated an increased proportion of World Cup slots.\nThe number of slots each confederation is granted is a matter of understandable debate. Delegates for the Confederation of African Football (Caf), for instance, insist it is unfair they have five slots for 54 members while Uefa, with 55 members, has 13. To which the response is that at the past five World Cups, including this one, only six of 26 African entrants (23%) have made it through the group while 40 of 67 European teams (60%) have. Why dilute the quality with teams who make little impact?\nYou can get into all kinds of abstruse arguments about whether it is a benefit to have more than one team from a confederation in the same group, but the argument \u2013 at least from a football rather than a political point of view \u2013 essentially boils down to the same thing: finding the balance between spreading the game and making the World Cup a battle between the very best sides (for what it\u2019s worth, if the World Cup was contested by the top 32 sides in the Fifa world rankings there would be 16 teams from Uefa and four from Caf).\nThe 48-team World Cup will, at least, give more opportunity to sides from outside the traditional elites. But there is a way of offering opportunity, providing a measure of fairness and development, while retaining the eight groups of four structure that works so well \u2013 and that is to globalise the final round of qualifying.\n\nFor the sake of argument, imagine a pair of hosts. Then have regional pre-qualifying to get down to 80 nations: 30 from Uefa, 20 from the Americas (Conmebol and Concacaf considered as one to avoid the issue of there being 10 South American nations), 15 from Africa and 15 from Asia and Oceania.\nThey can then compete in 20 groups of four \u2013 10 groups would have two Uefa nations \u2013 but otherwise teams from the same continent would be kept apart. Play home and away with the 20 top sides qualifying as of right and the 20 runners-up playing off for the 10 remaining places. Maybe you end up with 25 Uefa teams at the finals; or maybe you end up with only a handful. But the point is that a far greater spread of countries would have had a chance.\nIt would also mean three big home games for every side, offering fans in, say, Ghana or Honduras a far greater chance of seeing their country take on a Brazil or a France than if matches were being played on the other side of the world. Fifa may have to help fund infrastructure development in some places, but improving a stadium to international standards would be specific and direct development, which is surely better than the nebulous plans it often funds today.\nGlobalised qualifying also offers variety, so there wouldn\u2019t be the same sense of fatigue of Wales playing Belgium or the Republic of Ireland playing Denmark twice a year \u2013 and that, presumably, would be attractive to sponsors, advertisers and broadcasters.\n\nThe only real argument against is the carbon footprint \u2013 and that is an undeniable problem. But it is a huge problem generally for football and one to which it has not really faced up. It is certainly not a bigger issue than 48 teams flying across the US, Mexico and Canada for six weeks in 2026.\nFully globalised qualifying won\u2019t happen because football\u2019s leaders are more concerned with entrenching their own positions and incomes than with what is actually good for the game. But if we did somehow enter a brave new world when football was placed front and centre in football administration, this is what a future World Cup might look like:\nImagine 2030 is staged by Spain and Portugal (although Ukraine is part of their bid, a return to 32 teams makes a third host nation unnecessary). They both qualify as of right. Taking the other 20 highest-ranked sides in the Fifa rankings, you end up with 11 European seeds, six from the Americas, two from Africa and one from Asia. Placing one of them in each pot, using the rankings to determine who qualifies from each continent, assuming Russia remain suspended and with a tweak to include New Zealand as an Oceanian representative, a qualifying draw might look like this:\nA: Serbia, Austria, Canada, Ghana\nB: Argentina, Slovenia, UAE, Gabon\nC: Morocco, Iceland, El Salvador, Uzbekistan\nD: USA, Finland, Syria, Ivory Coast\nE: Uruguay, Norway, Jordan, Algeria\nF: Croatia, Poland, Ecuador, South Africa\nG: Wales, Czech Republic, Haiti, Nigeria\nH: England, Turkey, Panama, Japan\nI: Denmark, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Honduras, China\nJ: Italy, Hungary, Bolivia, Australia\nK: Germany, Sweden, Cura\u00e7ao, Iraq\nL: Iran, Romania, Jamaica, Mali\nM: Belgium, Costa Rica, New Zealand, DR Congo\nN: Netherlands, Ukraine, Venezuela, Cape Verde\nO: Colombia, Albania, Qatar, Cameroon\nP: France, Slovakia, Peru, Oman\nQ: Switzerland, Northern Ireland, Chile, Tunisia\nR: Brazil, Greece, Bahrain, Egypt\nS: Mexico, Republic of Ireland, South Korea, Burkina Faso\nT: Senegal, Scotland, Paraguay, Saudi Arabia"

                    "body": "\u201cI\u2019ll be watching it of course, at home, because I like football,\u201d Carlo Ancelotti said. \u201cMy teams will be the teams where my players play: Brazil, Spain, France, Uruguay, Croatia, Germany, lots of teams. I\u2019ll follow the World Cup as a fan, and may the best team win it. Unfortunately, Italy can\u2019t.\u201d There was a smile, a goodbye and with that he was gone. They all were. Just before midnight on a Thursday in early November and the Real Madrid coach was the last man to leave. La Liga was finished, everyone out of here for 50 days. Mentally, some had gone already.\nThis weekend is the first round of the Copa del Rey, but none of the Super Cup teams will be in it \u2013 no Madrid, Barcelona, Valencia or Betis \u2013 and not many of the World Cup players will be either. If they have got this far injury-free, and not all of them have, few will take one last risk against a team they\u2019ve never heard of; in fact, while no one admits it, the calendar was drawn up this way for this reason, to gain a little room, however tiny. Spain\u2019s squad has just been announced and some footballers have already flown, this final midweek round of games is a watershed no one wanted \u2013 even if for some teams stopping is the best thing they could do right now.\n\nFor others, it is the worst. For many players, meanwhile, getting here unscathed is all that matters. \u201cWe would rather not stop now; everything\u2019s coming off, even when we don\u2019t mean it to,\u201d said Real Mallorca manager Javier Aguirre on Wednesday, and no wonder: one of only three teams to have won their last two games, along with Barcelona and Girona, Mallorca had just racked up a third win in four, and against Atl\u00e9tico Madrid. Vedat Muriqi, a kind of Kosovar Andy Carroll, \u201ca big bastard with a big heart\u201d in his manager\u2019s words, \u201can ugly beast who plays really well\u201d, had just scored for the fifth game running, leaving the side that survived on the final day last season up in 11th, eight points from relegation.\nOn the other side, Diego Simeone just wanted it to end. Atl\u00e9tico have not won in five \u2013 a draw with Leverkusen, defeat at C\u00e1diz, defeat in Porto, a 1-1 against 10-man Espanyol and now this. Since their European elimination, it has taken them 71 shots to score four, two \u00c1lvaro Morata misses in Mallorca a portrait of something for which captain Koke insisted \u201cthere is no explanation\u201d. Which was understandable, if not entirely true. Jan Oblak has talked about a team \u201cpsychologically not right\u201d, the doubts around their identity have resurfaced and all is not well internally. The CEO, Miguel \u00c1ngel Gil Mar\u00edn, says that part of it is the World Cup itself, an \u201catypical season affecting the squad\u201d \u2013 even if Simeone then disagreed.\n\nThat of course is the case for many teams, even if only at some subconscious level. Sevilla\u2019s Papu G\u00f3mez admitted that in the final weeks, the World Cup would be on players\u2019 minds, some reluctant to put their foot in. In the Madrid media meanwhile, a new illness has been discovered, one that doesn\u2019t only affect them even if, like the Fifa virus, it\u2019s inevitably presented that way: worldcupitis. Defeated 3-2 at Rayo on Monday, where the last chance fell to Fede Valverde and ended up in someone\u2019s front room, they had drawn the previous game with Girona 1-1, and on Thursday night defeated second-bottom C\u00e1diz 2-1, relieved to see a clear chance for the visitors slip away in the last minute.\nThat said, they needn\u2019t have reached that point. Toni Kroos \u2013 who is not going to Qatar but playing better than ever \u2013 scored an outrageous volley to put them 2-0 up and Luka Modric should have made it three but somehow missed a sitter from six yards. \u201cIt\u2019s a good job Croatia have already picked their squad,\u201d Ancelotti joked. They have been without Karim Benzema and at the end of this game, Vin\u00edcius tweeted: \u201cAnother game without an injury, thank God.\u201d That was directed at the treatment from opponents \u2013 he is the most fouled player in La Liga \u2013 but the significance, the relief, comes from what\u2019s next.\n\nAsk Villarreal\u2019s Gio Lo Celso, a footballer Argentina manager Lionel Scaloni says could play at any club in the world but won\u2019t now play for his country. The good news is that Vin\u00edcius, like the rest, will not have to get through another club game without injury now. After an opening 14 weeks which have occasionally felt a little like they weren\u2019t real, like they were in the way of the World Cup \u2013 preparation for some, a risk for others \u2013 La Liga stops now. Which does at least give everyone a chance to work out where they are and what they need, the last matchday delivering a league table that will last six weeks.\nIt\u2019s not always good reading. Just one place and one point off the relegation zone, Celta\u2019s second manager, Carlos Carvalhal, started by leaving Iago Aspas on the bench and making the most fun place in Spanish football anything but, though at least he got a 0-0 draw at normally rampant Rayo. \u201cThis can\u2019t be; we can\u2019t have four coaches in 14 weeks, bloody hell,\u201d said Pere Milla after Elche were beaten again. Bottom of the table, they have not won a match \u2013 already the fifth longest winless start ever. And Villarreal could yet be heading for a third manager, although a 1-0 win over Espanyol might have saved Quique Seti\u00e9n \u2013 less than two weeks after taking over. \u201cI\u2019ve never watched a game so nervous,\u201d said his former assistant, and friend, Eder Sarabia.\nThey were grateful to Espanyol, the team that bring to mind a line from Alfredo Di St\u00e9fano: \u201cI don\u2019t ask the goalkeeper to stop the shots that are going in; it\u2019s enough for me that they don\u2019t put in the shots that are going wide.\u201d Both Benjamin Lecomte and \u00c1lvaro Fern\u00e1ndez have done that \u2013 this time it was the former who accidentally finished off an Alberto Moreno cross.\n\nFor Sevilla, it is even worse: down to nine men, the Pizjuan stood to applaud at the end, appreciating that they had even managed to make a game of it against a side who played superbly, but they were beaten again. Those fans have not seen them win at home all season, and Sevilla slipped back into the relegation zone.\nLife looks looks better for Valladolid, Almer\u00eda and Girona, the promoted teams lined up in 12th, 13th and 14th; Osasuna and Rayo, seventh and eighth; and just look at Athletic and Real Sociedad in the Champions League places. Then, above all, there\u2019s Barcelona, who came back from a man down and a goal down to defeat Osasuna, Raphinha lobbing in a lovely late header from an even lovelier Frenkie de Jong pass.\nIt was perfect for Gerard Piqu\u00e9, who lived the dream once more. How many times have you fantasised about finally sticking it to the man on your last ever day at work? Well Piqu\u00e9 did. Although he claims he didn\u2019t tell the referee to eff off (literally, \u201cI shit on your prostitute mother\u201d), despite that being what the official reported \u2013 which is a pity because they would be very famous last words \u2013 he did approach Jes\u00fas Gil Manzano at half-time, finger poking, following him down the tunnel and telling him that over the years he had been the ref that \u201cmost fucked us over by far\u201d. Sent off, unable to play his last game, Piqu\u00e9 did though spark a reaction and leave Barcelona top, the players dancing round the dressing room.\n\nWhatever happens next they will be there for a while. Primera won\u2019t be back until 31 December. So now what? \u201cWatch a lot of football,\u201d says Real Sociedad\u2019s Imanol Alguacil. Another first division coach says he\u2019ll be tuning into Real Oviedo\u2019s games in the second division, although he might have been slightly playing to his audience. One thing is true: clubs are in unknown territory and managers didn\u2019t know what impact the World Cup would have until now and or how it will play out from here on.\nOne coach says they have consulted with basketball and handball clubs, more accustomed to long breaks midseason, but admits the sports are too different for the conclusions and lessons to be beyond tentative. A fitness coach says one of the essential lessons from the pandemic is that you can\u2019t really plan, because you don\u2019t know what\u2019s coming; instead you have to be \u201cchameleonic\u201d.\nThe players\u2019 union guarantees a 10-day break, which non-World Cup players will get after the weekend\u2019s cup games, sessions restarting around 24 November, and World Cup players will have later, depending on when they arrive. Most clubs are preparing mini-preseasons, then there are friendlies: Betis play Manchester United and Villarreal play Arsenal. Many clubs are travelling abroad, others admit they haven\u2019t organised theirs yet, and the league is promoting tours. The teams that travel won\u2019t look much like those that played this week, even the smaller clubs having at least a couple of players Qatar-bound.\n\u201cRight now, no one can complain,\u201d said Sevilla coach Jorge Sampaoli. \u201cThis should have been fixed long ago. Because it\u2019s a huge business everything else is pushed to one side, and the consequences are paid by other people below them. Stopping the competition now to go and play there, is done. Everyone accepted it. Fifa decided it would be played in a place it shouldn\u2019t be played in and on dates it shouldn\u2019t be played on, and all for the \u2018silver\u2019.\u201d\n"

                    "body": "Gareth Southgate delivered the line with a smile. \u201cWe\u2019ve had to get through Qatari politics, Iranian politics \u2026 and a bit of tactical work on the pitch.\u201d What the England manager wanted to say more explicitly was obvious.\nAfter all the controversies which have overshadowed this World Cup it was time for him and his players to embrace the reason why they are here. And while sensitive to the various issues, none of them ought to be embarrassed or conflicted about feeling a surge of excitement before Monday\u2019s tournament opener against Iran.\n\nIf there is a recognition that Iran could be a tough nut to crack \u2013 Carlos Queiroz\u2019s team will be compact and difficult to break down \u2013 Southgate is confident that England are ready. That is because of the psychological work he has prioritised since getting his players together. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to make sure we know what our intent is, what our mindset is \u2013 we\u2019ve focused on that as much as we have the tactical and technical,\u201d Southgate said, and by that he meant a drive on three specific fronts.\nThere is the one to compartmentalise the negativity around these finals; another to banish that which has dogged his team since the summer, when a testing and potentially demoralising Nations League campaign began. And, finally, it has been vital to reset after the pause in the European club season.\n\u201cOur challenge was we were coming off the back of league matches last weekend with a lot going on, loads of games in a short period of time, lots of tactical meetings for them at their clubs, so we took the first couple of days to clear the brain as much as anything,\u201d Southgate said.\n\u201cTo be able to park whatever has been going well with a club or not so well \u2026 there are lots of different individuals in different spaces. And then to get a real focus on our group, getting them back together to enjoy the first couple of days.\u201d\nEnjoyment has been the watchword. The environment at the team hotel in Al Wakrah has been tailored to help the players relax. The Football Association hopes that the small details will make the difference, such as putting photographs of the players\u2019 loved ones in their bedrooms.\n\nSouthgate\u2019s training was calibrated to be light upon arrival, then briefly harder for heat acclimatisation purposes before he eased off again allowing the players, in his words, to \u201ctaper for the game\u201d. Everything has been condensed, boiled down for this most unusual of buildups.\nThe manager has told his squad that it is not their fault that the tournament is in Qatar, making it pretty clear what he thinks of the decision. What he has wanted to play up is the rare position in which they find themselves: representing England at a major tournament, the fulfilment of boyhood dreams.\nSouthgate has stressed that message, as his assistant Steve Holland has done as well. Indeed Prince William did likewise in an address to the squad at St George\u2019s Park before their departure. There have been other speeches and video presentations, with Southgate saying: \u201cYou have to remind yourself of this moment in time.\u201d Performance will come with freedom and awareness.\n\u201cTournament football is different,\u201d Southgate said. \u201cGermany have always been one of the prime examples of that. That\u2019s how we need to be, really.\u201d\nThe Germans have been on Southgate\u2019s mind, partly because of the Nations League and also because of their outstanding tournament record. \u201cWe want to be a Germany,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen I was looking at their Wikipedia page, it was four golds, four silvers, four bronzes at World Cups. European Championships: three golds, three silvers, three bronzes. Our page didn\u2019t quite look like that but we\u2019d love it if it did in 40 years\u2019 time and that should be our aim, to be consistently challenging.\u201d\nTo this end Southgate has tried to draw a veil over the quartet of Nations League fixtures in June, which brought draws with Germany and Italy and two defeats by Hungary. And surely the same goes for the Italy loss in September, when he was booed by the travelling England fans.\nThe final Nations League tie against Germany in September was better \u2013 the 3-3 draw at Wembley. England had rallied from 2-0 down to lead 3-2 before a late sucker punch.\n\u201cThere were 40 minutes of apprehension [in that game],\u201d Southgate said. \u201cI understood that, given the noise that was around the group. The players learned a lot from that. They can\u2019t affect that but they\u2019ve got to make sure they block that out. They know it has changed now. There is the excitement about a tournament and we want that intent and mindset that we saw in the last half an hour at Wembley. That has to be the start point for us.\n\u201cIt is also my responsibility to remind the players that actually there is a lot they\u2019ve done well and coming into this tournament they shouldn\u2019t be focusing on the recent past.\u201d\n\nSouthgate did not want to become embroiled in a discussion over his use of a back three or back four, although he knows that he will be judged more harshly if he plays the former against Iran and does not win. What he wants to find is the best way to apply pressure all over the pitch against a specific opponent, whether that is with a three, a four or even an in-game blend of the two.\nPatience stands to be vital. In 100 games under Queiroz, Iran have conceded two or more goals on only 15 occasions and have never come from behind to win. An attritional battle looms and England would do well to remember that it is often the case at this level.\n\u201cI played in a team [England] at Euro 96,\u201d Southgate said. \u201cEverybody will remember the Holland game but there was also a Switzerland game, a Spain game and half a Scotland game. I also remember watching the rerun of [the] 66 [World Cup final]. We were [leading] against [West] Germany, the team passed backwards and the crowd were booing. Plus \u00e7a change.\u201d Southgate is determined to chart fresh territory."

                    "body": "Elon Musk said on Tuesday that he will not step down as chief executive of the company until he can find a suitable replacement, citing the state of the company\u2019s finances as a reason to delay his promised departure. \u201cI will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job! After that, I will just run the software &amp; servers teams,\u201d Musk tweeted, before joining a Twitter livestream to discuss the company\u2019s situation with a former intern. It was the first time Musk had mentioned leaving the role as chief of the social media platform since Twitter users voted decisively in a poll for him to step down, which the billionaire launched on Sunday evening. But the acknowledgement was far from a firm commitment to keep to his promise.  In the broadcast, Musk chatted with audience members about his experience at the company, and emphasised the necessity of cutting costs. Under his watch, Twitter is down to \u201ca little over 2,000 people\u201d, he said, having been facing a \u201cnegative cash flow situation of $3bn [\u00a32.48bn] a year\u201d until he arrived, describing the situation as \u201cnet dead\u201d. \u201cThat\u2019s why I spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy,\u201d he said, to ensure that Twitter would be \u201croughly cash flow breakeven\u201d by 2023. Even now, running the company is as though \u201cyou\u2019re in a plane heading to the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don\u2019t work\u201d. Some of the company\u2019s costs, he acknowledged, were a result of his own acquisition, which saddled the company with $12.5bn of debt that it has to pay out of its revenues. But \u201cwith the changes we are making here on massively reducing the burn rate, and building subscriber revenue, I now think that Twitter will, in fact, be OK next year.\u201d This week\u2019s Twitter poll, sent in the wake of watching the World Cup final in Doha with Trump\u2019s son-in-law Jared Kushner, is not the first time Musk has said he will not run the company in the long term. In November, the second-richest person in the world told a court in Delaware he would reduce his time at Twitter and eventually find someone to run it in his place. Calls on Wall Street for Musk to step down had been growing for weeks, and recently Tesla investors have questioned whether his focus on the social media platform is distracting him from properly steering the electric vehicle business. Musk admitted in the court hearing that he had too much on his plate. He said on Sunday, though, that there was no successor and \u201cno one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive\u201d. Prior to Tuesday\u2019s tweet, Musk\u2019s only response to the poll was to tweet claims that the results had been skewed by fake accounts. He also responded to a tweet suggesting only users who were paying $8 or $11 (for iOS subscribers) for a Twitter Blue subscription should be able to vote in the polls by saying Twitter would \u201cmake that change.\u201d The poll calling for him to stand down followed a series of highly criticised decisions by Twitter\u2019s new owner. He first banned an account that tracked the location of his private jet, and followed it up with a mass suspension of critical journalists who reported on the ban. After users responded by announcing plans to leave to other platforms, Musk implemented a new policy banning all links to other social networks, including Mastodon, Instagram and Facebook. The change was made during the Fifa World Cup final in Qatar, where Musk was spotted in attendance with Kushner. By the end of the day, the policy had been abandoned, with Musk saying all major policy changes in the future would be decided by a vote. Reuters contributed to this report."

                    "body": "The Wallabies have been told to strap themselves in for the ride after Eddie Jones made a sensational return as Australia coach following the sacking of Dave Rennie just months before the Rugby World Cup begins in France. Jones, who has been without a job since being dismissed by England at the end of last year, was given the role after Rennie\u2019s tenure was ended with immediate effect by Rugby Australia on Monday following a string of disappointing results that saw the team slump to eighth in the world.  Jones was sacked in December despite boasting the highest win ratio of any England coach, but has not had to wait long for another opportunity to arrive, with a five-year deal signed with RA that will see him oversee the next two men\u2019s World Cup campaigns. In a \u201cworld-first\u201d role structure, he will also take charge of the Wallaroos program as Rugby Australia pushes forward towards a professional future for the women\u2019s game. Wallabies great Tim Horan said handing Jones the reins was a risky move, but one that could pay off for RA if he was able to quickly turn around results on the field. \u201cEddie Jones as new Wallabies coach ... brave and has some risk,\u201d Horan tweeted. \u201cBut maybe a risk worth taking considering the Wallabies current win/loss ratio. We need a Bledisloe Cup within two years and RWC semi and Lions win to justify the decision. Strap yourself in for the ride.\u201d The Australian returns to the job he held from 2001 to 2005, during which he took his team to the 2003 Rugby World Cup final in Sydney. He said the chance to again coach his country at the global showpiece event was too good to turn down. \u201cIt is going to be an immense period for Australian rugby \u2013 as a proud Australian, it is a great honour to be able to come home and lead the national team during these years,\u201d Jones said. \u201cThe Wallabies squad is a really talented group of players with good depth \u2013 if we can have everyone fit and healthy going into the World Cup this year, I am confident that we can go to France and break the 24-year drought of winning the Rugby World Cup. \u201cI saw how gutsy the Wallaroos were in the Rugby World Cup in New Zealand last year \u2013 it looks like there is a real spirit in that group that will drive the women\u2019s program forward ahead of their next World Cup in 2025. \u201cI am really looking forward to getting back home and getting stuck in.\u201d Rugby Australia chairman Hamish McLennan said securing Jones\u2019s services was a \u201cmajor coup\u201d and labelled the 62-year-old \u201cthe best coach in the world\u201d. \u201cEddie\u2019s deep understanding of our rugby system and knowledge of our player group and pathways will lift the team to the next level,\u201d McLennan said. \u201cEddie instinctively understands the Australian way of playing rugby \u2013 this represents an opportunity to secure a coach of immense expertise and experience at the biggest competitions, and we did not want to miss it.\u201d Rennie paid the price for a poor run of results over the last calendar year: just five wins from 14 Test matches saw the New Zealander finish with a win percentage of 38 \u2013 the lowest of any Wallabies coach in charge of at least 30 Tests and in stark contrast to Jones\u2019s 73% as England coach. RA CEO Andy Marinos said he was grateful for Rennie\u2019s work and thanked him for his services over the past three years. \u201cDave has been instrumental in developing much of the depth that we see in and around the current Wallabies squad; there are a number of players that are genuine World Cup possibilities because of opportunities that Dave has provided,\u201d Marinos said.  \u201cThe work ethic, the spirit within the group, and the way the team carries itself are all a direct result of Dave\u2019s input \u2013 he has made a real mark on this group of players.\u201d Former Wallabies player Matt Giteau backed Jones to have the desired impact on the squad. \u201cI feel for Rennie but at the same time if anyone can turn things around quickly it\u2019s Eddie,\u201d he tweeted. \u201cSome of the boys won\u2019t know what\u2019s hit them.\u201d Jones will take up his role in an official capacity on 28 January, just under eight months before the start of the 2023 Rugby World Cup in France."

                    "body": "Everton confirmed Sean Dyche as their manager on Monday and set about trying to strengthen his squad by making a bid worth up to \u00a345m for Chelsea\u2019s Conor Gallagher and pursuing the Rennes winger Kamaldeen Sulemana.\nOther clubs are interested in Gallagher, who was part of England\u2019s World Cup squad in Qatar and has started nine Premier League games this season, including the past two against Crystal Palace and Liverpool. Everton\u2019s offer is \u00a340m with the rest in add-ons. It is unlikely the 22-year-old will want a move to Goodison Park.\n\nEverton have not made a signing this month but Anthony Gordon\u2019s sale to Newcastle has released funds and the 20-year-old Sulemana, a member of Ghana\u2019s World Cup squad, is another target.\nDyche has said Everton need everybody aligned in their fight for Premier League survival after being appointed on a two-and-a-half-year contract.\nHe was confirmed as Frank Lampard\u2019s replacement having emerged as the frontrunner when talks with Marcelo Bielsa, the first choice of the owner, Farhad Moshiri, broke down. The 51-year-old takes over a team who have won once in 12 Premier League games and are joint-bottom. He also takes over a divided club, where supporters are calling for Moshiri to sack his board after years of mismanagement.\nDyche, the eighth permanent manager of the Moshiri era, has called for all parties to work together to help preserve the club\u2019s 69-year top flight status. He said: \u201cIt is tougher times. All I can ask for is a bit of a breather because I know there is a lot going on but we need the fans, we need unity and we need to be aligned from right the way through the ownership, right the way through me, the staff, into the team and out to the people. \n\n\u201cAnyone can take the wheel of a ship in calm waters, but it\u2019s not calm waters at the minute. You have to earn the right and it\u2019s my job to earn the right. It is not a given. We have to make sure people are getting something.\u201d\nThe former Burnley manager, who has been out of work for nine months, added: \u201cHopefully, with hard work from myself, my staff and the players we can reignite the passion of the fans. It is still there. You have seen it. We need a chance to find that alignment, that\u2019s a really important thing, and that starts with the team and me as the manager. \n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to give the fans something so they can start regripping hold of the club through the team. That\u2019s what I\u2019m going to be working to. It starts with hard graft. The connection with the fans can grow very quickly because they are very passionate, but we\u2019ve got to give them something to be passionate about.\n\n\u201cWe want to change the shape of this club going forward, remodel it in our style, but in a way that we can win. That\u2019s the task in front of us \u2013 make sure we\u2019re building, tactically and technically, giving players organisation, allow them the freedom to play, to go and enjoy their football because it\u2019s brilliant when the team\u2019s playing with a smile, but we\u2019ve got to win.\u201d\nDyche has been joined by his former Burnley backroom team of assistant manager Ian Woan, first-team coach Steve Stone and sports scientist Mark Howard. His first game will be against the league leaders, Arsenal, at Goodison Park on Saturday\n\u201cThere is quality in this squad, but we have to make them shine,\u201d he said. \u201cI have played against these players and I know some of them personally. There is quality. There is not that much wrong, not as much as you think. Sometimes, the lines between success and failure in football seem massive, but there are some good things here and now it is about adapting to what is already here and how I think we can make it work better than it has been.\u201d\nDyche held talks with Everton\u2019s director of football, Kevin Thelwell, last week and visited the club\u2019s Finch Farm training ground over the weekend while his contract was being finalised.\nEverton\u2019s chairman, Bill Kenwright, a target for the fans\u2019 protests, said: \u201cKevin and I spent some valuable time with Sean over the past few days and he quickly convinced me that he has exactly the right attributes to make himself a great Everton manager \u2013 and a man who could inspire our fanbase. And Farhad felt the same when he met him, too.\u201d"

Die Turniermannschaft \u2013 the \u201ctournament team\u201d who, as Germany or West Germany, have also been World Cup runners-up four times and in European Championships been winners three times and runners-up three times, too? Or the rabble whose World Cup defence in 2018 ended in the ignominy of a group-stage exit as the bottom nation after defeats by Mexico and South Korea and who were beaten 2-0 by England in the last 16 at last year\u2019s Euros?\nJoshua Kimmich, who is expected to line up at Khalifa International Stadium in midfield, was the right-back in Germany\u2019s dismal title defence four years ago. \u201cThe motivation is huge,\u201d he said. \u201cWe know that was nothing, that was terrible what happened. We\u2019ve had quite the wait \u2013 four and a half years.\n\n\u201cThe first game is very important; we\u2019ve seen that in previous tournaments. At the Euros we lost the first game and didn\u2019t win [the title].\u201d\nManuel Neuer and Thomas M\u00fcller were in the triumphant side of 2014 but Kimmich and other potential starters who include Antonio R\u00fcdiger, Serge Gnabry, Kai Havertz, Ilkay G\u00fcndogan and Jamal Musiala have never won an international title. \nHansi Flick, the head coach, cited being Joachim L\u00f6w\u2019s assistant eight years ago. \u201cI was part of the team in 2014 \u2013 with [Lukas] Podolski, [Mats] Hummels, [Philipp] Lahm,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was the same: before the tournament people were saying they haven\u2019t won big titles yet. You can\u2019t compare the generations.\n\n\u201cThis generation is characterised by the fact they are very focused on the game and always push their limits. They are players who always try to get better every time they step on the pitch. It\u2019s wonderful to see as a coach. \n\u201cWe know the competition is strong. Look at Argentina and Saudi Arabia \u2013 everything is possible. But that\u2019s what makes football beautiful. Never underestimate your opponent.\n\u201cOver the past couple of days we had great practice, we had a very satisfying last practice, we have very good conditions now to go into the game. We can have a very positive outlook going into this game but also tackling this tournament as a whole.\u201d\nFlick and Kimmich attempted to brush off Germany\u2019s part in the collective decision by seven European nations to perform a U-turn regarding their captains wearing a OneLove armband. \u201cThe German team wanted to do this and to take a stand,\u201d Flick said. \u201cBut now Fifa have threatened us basically with sanctions [a yellow card]. If you want to run a campaign like this together, you should stick to your decisions.\u201d\n\nIf the last comment poses the question why Germany did not go ahead with the plan, Kimmich asked to be allowed to enjoy the competition. \u201cIt\u2019s every little boy\u2019s dream to participate in a World Cup,\u201d he said. \u201cA lot of people have tried to convince us that we shouldn\u2019t be looking forward to this. At home lots of people aren\u2019t as excited. But I feel I should be looking forward to this, even if it\u2019s being hosted here.\u201d\nJapan, coached by Hajime Moriyasu, have seven squad members at Bundesliga clubs. They include the centre-back Maya Yoshida, who played 154 Premier League games for Southampton and was in the Schalke side that lost 2-0 against a Bayern Munich featuring Gnabry, Musiala, Kimmich, Neuer, and Leroy San\u00e9 (who is unavailable for this game because of a knee injury) in the last match before this tournament.\nYoshida said: \u201cPlaying against them is better analysis than watching the video \u2013 it was a great experience. One of the reasons I came to the Bundesliga was to experience German football. The key is we have to defend well. In football there is the game we should win, but there never exists a game where we should lose. So we believe we have a chance.\u201d"

                    "body": "There is a special corner of Twitter which spends much of its time lamenting the flaws of football in this country. It is referred to \u2013 in equal parts affection and frustration \u2013 as #SokkahTwitter. This inebriating sphere of pandemonium is a silent-but-deafening concoction of joy, rage, intellectual acuity and utter nonsense. But it is also, almost unanimously, in agreement on one core belief: player development pathways in Australia are fundamentally flawed.  This online conversation would barely register for the many Australians who tune in only to watch the national team play the big games \u2013 the matches trumpeted as those that matter. So they buy a ticket or turn on the TV and then, in a flash, are hit with it, overcome by the heat of an oven opened in their faces. As it stands, after Thursday night\u2019s 2-0 defeat to Japan, the Socceroos are hurtling inexorably towards some place other than the World Cup. They are on the road not to Qatar 2022 but an arid oblivion not experienced since the finals in South Korea and Japan 20 years ago. They have just lost a home World Cup qualifier with a result riding on it for the first time since 1981. The casual fan may not hear or read the stream of analyses \u2013 #SokkahTwitter or otherwise \u2013 dissecting Australia\u2019s performances in many a Fifa window. They come away with only what they have seen in front of them. And perhaps this is not an entirely irrelevant lens through which to consider the Socceroos\u2019 predicament \u2013 a mortifying mess which is also confusing because this team which symbolises so much to so many people now looks like bric-a-brac of a past era. There were a couple of positives to appreciate, such as the classy Ajdin Hrustic and, for the most part, Mat Ryan. Viewers certainly would have sighted the hosts\u2019 disallowed first-half goal and deduced that, had it stood, the complexion of the contest might have shifted. Mostly, though, they would have seen Takumi Minamino rip through Australia\u2019s defence and Kaoru Mitoma score a brace in the final minutes. Of course, there are caveats \u2013 Australian football loves a caveat. Key players were unavailable for this match and the ones who were played in a manner befitting an XI which has spent little time together on a pitch. There are also viable questions around tactical and selection missteps. There will be further debate about Graham Arnold\u2019s future. Separately, there have already been queries about the wisdom of a Covid-positive head coach walking his dog at the beach instead of isolating at home. Then there is Covid in general \u2013 travel restrictions enforced by the pandemic have ensured an even more mentally and physically arduous qualifying route. But at the crux of what has gone awry over the past 15 or so years is the bottleneck of player development. The paucity of opportunities for young, talented footballers to fulfil their potential and a resulting lack of national-team depth. This problem is evident at all levels of the domestic game but it is the most perceptible at the top of the inverted pyramid.  The A-League Men has been heavily relied upon to produce high-quality players and yet there remains no solid, collective plan in place for this to occur. The coaches, understandably, prioritise their own teams, an issue compounded by a policy of not breaking for international windows. In 2018, when Arnold was managing Sydney FC, he said \u201cI don\u2019t see the A-League as a development league\u201d. In 2019, after he was appointed Socceroos head coach, he called for the urgent establishment of a national second division or A-League reserves competition so players between the key development ages of 17 and 22 had somewhere to play. Still there is no second division, nor promotion and relegation. The FFA Centre of Excellence, a talent factory for the golden generation, has long been shut down. And it is worth asking whether those golden-generation players, that class of 2006 against whom every performance since has been measured, may have laboured just to break through in this iteration of the domestic league. Would a young Mark Viduka have been given a game? The same goes for Harry Kewell and John Aloisi. Yes, these are examples of attacking players, but the development of local talent in front-third positions has become particularly problematic given clubs are increasingly signing imports as their regular starters in these sexier roles.  Primarily because of this, the Socceroos are in a state of paralysis. For years many believed they were punching above their weight, achieving wonderful things against the odds. Years later they should be accomplishing wonderful things but are instead falling demonstrably short as a rapidly developing Asian confederation ploughs full steam ahead. Much of the focus around Australia\u2019s upcoming playoffs has been around the formidable South American tie which now looms as the final hurdle to Qatar. We are getting well ahead of ourselves. Before that is even a consideration Australia must beat the other third-placed team from Group A in a sudden-death playoff. At this stage that is likely to be the United Arab Emirates, who knocked the Socceroos out of the 2019 Asian Cup. And this should be cause for serious introspection. Japan have built a very good team on the back of three decades of development through the J. League. Its model ensures most players have a sound technical foundation at a young age and progress systematically through a pyramid of underage teams, from which J. League sides select their senior squads. The country has set the benchmark for youth development in Asia. Australia\u2019s loss was predictable, and for that it has much to learn."

                    "body": "Liverpool and Juventus are keeping track of the growing uncertainty around Mason Mount\u2019s future after Chelsea\u2019s talks with the England midfielder over a new deal were put on hold until after the World Cup. Mount\u2019s deal expires in just over 18 months and his situation has prompted clubs to check whether he could be lured away from Stamford Bridge. The 23-year-old has been in discussions with Chelsea since the summer and, with no sign of a breakthrough, negotiations are not expected to resume until January.  Chelsea\u2019s owners have no desire to lose Mount, who has been attached to the club for his entire career, and remain optimistic that he will stay. Mount has been talked up as a future Chelsea captain and the hierarchy want to reward his performances with an improved deal. However there have been indications that an agreement is not guaranteed. Mount is one of the lowest earners in the first-team squad and wants a new deal to reflect his status as one of Graham Potter\u2019s most important players. Chelsea\u2019s initial proposals have fallen below his expectations. Mount has established himself as one of the brightest young talents in the Premier League in the past three years and is attracting interest from Juventus and Liverpool, who need to freshen up their midfield options. Manchester City have previously been linked with Mount, who has been valued by his managers for his ability on the ball, versatility, pressing and tactical intelligence. Whether Mount would see moving to Juventus, who are having a disappointing season, as a good move at this stage of his career remains to be seen. The prospect of some of Europe\u2019s top sides targeting Mount could lead to greater urgency from Chelsea. Their owners, Todd Boehly and Clearlake Capital, will be keen to avoid a repeat of the messy situation they inherited. Chelsea lost Antonio R\u00fcdiger and Andreas Christensen on free transfers last summer and Thiago Silva, N\u2019Golo Kant\u00e9 and Jorginho\u2019s deals run out at the end of this season.  Chelsea, who have promoted their academy director, Neil Bath, to director of football development and operations, have shown a willingness to reward their young talents. Reece James and Armando Broja signed new long-term deals recently. Meanwhile, \u00c9douard Mendy is considering his future after losing his place as Chelsea\u2019s No 1 to Kepa Arrizabalaga. Mendy, who will be Senegal\u2019s first-choice goalkeeper at the World Cup, could seek assurances after a difficult start to the season. The 30-year-old\u2019s deal runs out in 2024 and he is also one of the squad\u2019s lower earners. He has so far been reluctant to sign an extension. Potter has favoured Arrizabalaga since replacing Thomas Tuchel in September. Mendy got back in the team after Arrizabalaga was injured against Brighton last month, but there is no guarantee he will be a starter after Qatar."

                    "body": "In Dubai on Friday night, at a frenetic last-minute ruck, the US prop Jack Iscaro conceded the penalty Portugal kicked for a 16-16 draw, enough to secure a place at the Rugby World Cup in France and condemn the Eagles to watch from home.  The Americans were in the final qualification tournament because in Colorado in July they lost a similarly tight game to Chile. Then, a last-minute penalty that might\u2019ve saved the game was reversed, because the prop Chance Wenglewski made an illegal clear-out. Wenglewski, 25, is a product of Lindenwood University in Missouri who plays for New York, the champions of Major League Rugby. Iscaro, 22, played at California Berkeley and now props for Old Glory DC. Both have come through top college programmes to play for pay at home. Neither is experienced in Test rugby, Wenglewski with 10 caps, Iscaro just two. Now is perhaps their darkest hour but such misadventures can befall any player and are there to be learned from. Wenglewski and Iscaro could be key members of Eagles squads through to the 2031 World Cup, eight years from now, which will take place on American soil. At 33 and 30, injuries and form allowing, they could be in their propping prime. There isn\u2019t a prop in world rugby who hasn\u2019t experienced his or her fair share of horrible things. It\u2019s the whole point. They like it. Another Eagles prop, David Ainu\u2019u, spoke to reporters after the Portugal game. Born in American Samoa, he is also just 22 but has seen a bit more of the world, with 20 caps and a contract with Toulouse. Ainu\u2019u said: \u201cIf we were in a situation where I didn\u2019t feel like the boys gave every bit of effort, every bit of grit and blood, sweat and tears on that field, I think I would feel something else. But I think right now, it\u2019s just the game. It came down to a small decision and I can\u2019t blame the boys. Every single one of those guys that stepped on that field gave all they could and we were just the unlucky ones at the end of the day.\u201d The huge lock Greg Peterson, who plays for Newcastle, rumbled a bit about the penalty against the Eagles at an attacking five-metre scrum, at 16-13, which allowed Portugal to race upfield. \u201cI think they\u2019ve matched our scrum and our maul really well so credit to them,\u201d he said. \u201cThey really made leaps and bounds from their previous games. We were quite good in terms of penalty count except probably the last 20 minutes. And yeah, it just came down to a few things in that last couple of minutes \u2026 the ref gave it to the other side at the scrum five but that\u2019s just sport, isn\u2019t it.\u201d It\u2019s also just sport that the Eagles\u2019 coaching may change. Gary Gold, once a South Africa assistant, later of London Irish, Newcastle and Worcester, oversaw results including a first win over a tier-one team, Scotland in 2018. But since Covid wrecked 2020, nothing has been straightforward. Through qualifying losses to Uruguay and Chile, a 100-point hiding from New Zealand and on to Dubai, there has been a sense of a team unable to escape their fate. In Dubai, Gold was assisted by Mario Ledesma, once an Argentina hooker and head coach, John Plumtree, recently on the All Blacks staff, and another well-traveled New Zealander, Stephen Brett. Despite all that experience, it wasn\u2019t to be. Congratulating Portugal on a \u201cwell-fought game\u201d, Gold said: \u201cThere aren\u2019t many words for how gutted this group feels right now. Both teams played an intense 80 minutes with high emotions. This one just didn\u2019t fall our way. \u201cI can\u2019t overstate how proud I am of the players and staff, regardless of result. We\u2019ve learned a lot about ourselves and our capabilities over the last year when the qualification journey first began, and these harsh lessons are ones we\u2019ll lean on going forward.  \u201cThis last tour was special as we had a number of new players put their hand up, debut on the world stage and provide some promise for the future. We definitely left some point opportunities on the field tonight, which is always a tough reflection in a close game. However, there was no effort spared and from that we can walk away knowing we gave it our all.\u201d Teams who have won the Rugby World Cup are of course of an entirely different order to this American squad, who will watch France 2023 on TV. But there is something in common: crushing disappointment often precedes success.  Many of the England players who lifted the Webb Ellis Cup in Sydney in 2003 lost a quarter-final to South Africa four years before. Plenty of New Zealanders who won in Auckland in 2011 (and London four years later) were in Cardiff in 2007 when France ran away with the game. Many of the Springboks who won the final in Tokyo four years ago lost a semi to New Zealand in 2015. Undoubtedly, American rugby faces dark days. MLR is unsettled, contracts abroad hard to find and tricky to keep. There are no prizes for coming second. The road to 2031 will be brutally tough. But immediately after the deadly draw in Dubai, the Eagles\u2019 captain, the Bristol fly-half AJ MacGinty, suggested all is not necessarily lost. \u201cIt was seconds away from us,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s our second time tasting that sort of defeat. It\u2019s sore, but we gave it our best shot \u2026 I\u2019m really proud of the squad, the group, all the coaches for the amount of time that\u2019s gone into putting us in the best position for this. It was almost there.\u201d"

                    "body": "Two games of football \u2013 that is what it will take for Papua New Guinea to make history. As they take the field in New Zealand this week for the World Cup intercontinental playoffs, two wins would see the Pacific island nation reach its first World Cup. The journey has been far from easy. The national team did not play a match from July 2019 until April 2022 but with New Zealand co-hosting the tournament this July and August, PNG seized the opportunity to qualify by winning the Oceania Nations Cup last July. Since then, results have slid, with Nicola Demaine losing her job as manager and little to no football played over almost three months. This was the context into which Spencer Prior arrived in November. The 51-year-old brings a wealth of management experience with Australia, Young Matildas and Thailand women\u2019s team. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to do in four months what other teams have spent four years preparing for,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s been a real whirlwind trying to get them fit, trying to get them some tactical understanding of what we want to do \u2026 I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve wasted a single minute.\u201d Prior brought in his own staff, including assistant Nicola Williams after she left Leicester City. They have added local PNG coaches, to help them develop and because of their knowledge of the players. The team have been based in Sydney and New Zealand, tapping into top-class facilities and participating in three-week training blocks to prepare. \u201cThe positive is that it\u2019s a blank canvas,\u201d Prior says. \u201cI think part of the reason that I was put in was because of my experience with Thailand\u2019s women\u2019s team; going into a programme and getting an understanding of the culture, first and foremost. To earn the players\u2019 trust and then start to put stuff into place, it needed to be done very quickly.  \u201cThe players are keen to learn. It\u2019s been hard work and we\u2019ve really pushed them. The most exciting thing is that I don\u2019t think the team understands the potential that they have. We took them to the Sydney Football Stadium where they will play their first game [against France] if they qualify. That got some excitement going in terms of what can happen if they win these next two games.\u201d In PNG, women face significant inequality and gender-based violence is high. This context has meant Prior and his staff have been keen to keep them in camp where they can ensure their safety and look after their needs and nutrition. \u201cPort Moresby [PNG\u2019s capital] isn\u2019t safe for girls to be going out on their own,\u201d Prior says. \u201cRugby league is the national sport so when you factor in that these girls play football, and that they\u2019re girls, they\u2019re pretty much treated as second-class citizens. Also, the fact that they get to come to Australia and travel \u2013 there\u2019s very much a tall poppy syndrome not just within communities but families as well.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s tough. We\u2019ve got five or six mums in the squad. They miss family and they make huge sacrifices \u2026 Making sure that they\u2019re relaxed and comfortable off the pitch has been key. [We have surrounded] ourselves with good local support staff \u2013 good player welfare officers who understand the girls.\u201d The challenge is reflected in the national programme. PNG hosted the 2016 Under-20 Women\u2019s World Cup but has struggled to develop since. \u201cThere\u2019s a chance to build and focus on getting more players through,\u201d Prior says. \u201cWe\u2019ve got players here who haven\u2019t been in the national team before. They\u2019re young; they\u2019ve got engines; they\u2019re enthusiastic and reasonably technical \u2026 If they qualify for the World Cup and they get the $5m, it will be interesting to make sure it all goes into the women\u2019s programme. That\u2019s genuine legacy.\u201d  The first hurdle is Panama on Sunday, opponents Prior anticipates will be \u201cpredictably unpredictable\u201d. If PNG win, Chinese Taipei or Paraguay stand between them and the World Cup. Prior was a little coy when asked what to expect. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you what we won\u2019t do,\u201d he says. \u201cWe won\u2019t get rid of their natural attributes, which are to be strong and to fight \u2026 I\u2019ll let everybody else be the judge of it. Who knows? It might be enough. At least we\u2019ve had a bit of a fun and we\u2019ve all had a good time working hard together.\u201d One thing is certain: the opportunity PNG have over the next 10 days is significant. \u201cThey might never get such a great chance again,\u201d says Prior. \u201cThe OFC [Oceania Football Confederation] have been incredibly supportive. It\u2019s a real challenge down here. I think to get there would be ridiculously overachieving, but it is a possibility, right? It\u2019s two games of football. That\u2019s it. If they are successful, I\u2019m sure there would be a couple of glasses of red wine shared amongst the staff and then it would be looking at what is next on their journey.\u201d Recommended viewing Beth England\u2019s driving run from halfway before cutting inside and sweeping a shot into the far corner against United showed why Spurs paid big money to sign the striker from Chelsea last month.

                    "body": "1) Argentina\nFour years ago Argentina went home from Russia in a mess. Now they look in the best shape of all the contenders and what a story it would be if Lionel Messi crowned his final World Cup with the trophy. Lionel Scaloni\u2019s team were unbeaten in qualifying \u2013 although they must contest one more replayed dead rubber against Brazil, who they defeated last year to win a first Copa Am\u00e9rica since 1993 \u2013 and overwhelmed Italy in the \u201cFinalissima\u201d. Is a 36-year duck ready to be broken?\n\n2) Brazil\nThe perennial favourites have been in excellent form as usual having thrashed South Korea 5-1 this month before Neymar\u2019s penalty secured a 1-0 win over Japan. But with Argentina having gained the upper hand over Tite\u2019s side in recent meetings, including in the Copa Am\u00e9rica final at the Maracan\u00e3 last year, will Brazil be able to turn the tables and end their 20-year wait for a sixth World Cup win?\n3) Spain\nLuis Enrique\u2019s side steadily improved in the Nations League, drawing with Portugal and the Czech Republic before beating Switzerland and the Czechs to take control of their group. The lack of a top-class striker is the main issue for the 2010 winners but the potential of the new generation led by Pedri and Gavi is clear.\n\n4) Netherlands\nThe eye-catching 4-1 win over Belgium in Brussels will have raised expectations among Oranje supporters as they prepare for their first World Cup since 2014. Louis van Gaal, who led them to the semi-finals in Brazil that year, is back and will fancy his chances of a similar run with a youthful side that got the better of Wales with stoppage-time winners twice in the space of seven days.\n5) Germany\nBattered and broken last summer, Germany have quickly discovered a clear identity under Hansi Flick. The transition between generations is being cleverly managed and they are producing the kind of slick football that largely went missing at Euro 2020. Tuesday\u2019s demolition of Italy suggested things are coming together after a run of draws and, as the adage goes, they cannot be written off.\n6) France\nTwo home defeats and two away draws were not the June results France wanted. The world champions are struggling to convince despite the depth of talent at their disposal; there is a reliance on Karim Benzema and Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 for goals and the hangover from last summer\u2019s Euro 2020 exit to Switzerland has not properly cleared. Something needs to click in Qatar.\n\n7) Denmark\nAlthough the emotion of Christian Eriksen\u2019s collapse and recovery undoubtedly helped fuel their run to the Euro 2020 semi-finals, Denmark have proved without doubt that they are among the world\u2019s top international teams. They stormed through the qualifiers, recently won away against Group D opponents France and, best of all, Eriksen is pulling the strings once again. A good bet to go far.\n8) Belgium\nAn embarrassing 4-1 home defeat to the Netherlands this month laid bare an uncomfortable truth: that Belgium\u2019s golden generation may have had their time. Given they responded with a six-goal demolition of Poland it would be premature to write the obituaries but an ageing defence and spluttery attack do not feel, at this point, like potential winners in Qatar.\n9) Portugal\nA star-studded squad has struggled to reach its potential since winning Euro 2016. Defeat by Switzerland last week was their first in the Nations League and after the disappointing last-16 exit to Uruguay in Russia, Fernando Santos and Cristiano Ronaldo will be keen to make amends in what could be a last major international tournament for both.\n10) England\nAs a disbelieving Gareth Southgate observed after the 4-0 home defeat to Hungary, the mood around those watching England has turned within a mere 11 days. There was already unease after a narrow loss in Budapest and unremarkable draws against Germany and Italy; that turned to outright revolt at Molineux and it is no way to set a tone five months out from Qatar. England remain favoured to reach the latter stages but a previously serene ship has begun listing dangerously.\n\n11) Senegal\nAfter winning the Africa Cup of Nations and squeaking past Egypt again to earn their spot, Senegal are on a high. They were unlucky to exit the group stage on the fair play tiebreaker in 2018 but will feel confident of a knockout spot this time. Aliou Ciss\u00e9 has them superbly drilled but questions about creativity remain and they will hope Sadio Man\u00e9 settles at Bayern Munich if that move goes through.\n12) Uruguay\nLuis Su\u00e1rez and Edinson Cavani may be waning but the rise of Darwin N\u00fa\u00f1ez is perfectly timed for Uruguay, who have a habit of showcasing gladiatorial strikers at World Cups. Diego Alonso\u2019s appointment has revitalised La Celeste, who wobbled badly towards the end of \u00d3scar Tab\u00e1rez\u2019s 15-year reign; they have won six games and drawn another this year, rarely concede, and look ready to compete fiercely once again.\n13) Croatia\nThey had dipped since 2018 but set a marker this month with eye-catching wins in Denmark and France. Such is the quality available to Zlatko Dalic that his canny, technically excellent side will always have a chance of going far; the issue is that so much still hinges on players like Luka Modric, 36, and the 33-year-old Ivan Perisic. The heroes from a remarkable generation may be running on fumes in Qatar.\n14) Switzerland\nLast summer the Swiss showed they can be better than last-16 makeweights. They have been inconsistent since under their new coach Murat Yakin but Sunday\u2019s win against Portugal reiterated that an experienced side will be formidable opponents when functioning fully. A tricky group-stage draw, pitting them against Brazil and Serbia, means they will need to hit the ground running in Qatar.\n15) Serbia\nA team that tends to arrive at tournaments high on promise but ends up short on delivery. It could be different this time: Dusan Tadic is better than ever at 33 and, if he picks opponents\u2019 locks, Dusan Vlahovic leads a set of exciting centre-forward options. Sergej Milinkovic-Savic is now in his prime and an impressive win in Sweden suggests a once-brittle side may have toughened up.\n\n16) Canada\nA little-known quantity at this level having previously qualified in 1986, Canada will fancy letting their clutch of top-class talent loose on ageing Belgium and Croatia sides in Qatar. Alphonso Davies, Jonathan David and Cyle Larin are capable of troubling anyone. A dispute about prize money has caused ructions this month and John Herdman, their excellent English manager, will hope distractions are kept to a minimum.\n17) Wales\nThe Welsh qualified for their first World Cup since 1958 amid a now familiar cocktail of emotion and high spirits. Now they must ensure their quality players, particularly Gareth Bale, are receiving regular club minutes at a decent level in the runup to Qatar. A tight-knit, highly motivated squad have become accustomed to eking out results against elite opposition and will feel a knockout spot is there for the taking.\n18) Poland\nPoland tend to be thrown in among the dark horses but recent results, which include a thrashing by Belgium and a creditable draw in Rotterdam, suggest it is hard to know which side will turn up. They did well to beat Sweden in the playoffs and troubled England twice but much, as always, hangs on Robert Lewandowski. At almost 34 the captain remarkably gets better with age but could do with sorting out his club situation quickly.\n19) Mexico\nA comprehensive 3-0 defeat by Uruguay in a recent friendly was an example of how El Tri have struggled in recent months despite qualifying for their 17th World Cup with relative ease. Gerardo Martino\u2019s side did beat Nigeria late last month but were held to a 1-1 draw by Jamaica in the Concacaf Nations League on Tuesday.\n20) USA\nGrateful for an injury-time equaliser against El Salvador in their Nations League match on Tuesday night, Gregg Berhalter will have been encouraged by the performances in beating Morocco 3-0 at the start of the month and then drawing with Uruguay. The USA coach has some big calls to make before naming his squad, notably in attack.\n\n21) Morocco\nVahid Halilhodzic\u2019s position is under growing pressure despite two victories in Morocco\u2019s Africa Cup of Nations qualifiers against South Africa and Liberia. The coach\u2019s decision to exclude high-profile players such as Chelsea\u2019s Hakim Ziyech has not been popular with supporters and the Bosnian could, for the second time, find himself out of a job after qualifying for the World Cup, having experienced the same fate with Ivory Coast in 2010.\n22) Cameroon\nThe Indomitable Lions have played only once in this international break because of the cancellation of their fixtures against Kenya: a 1-0 win in Burundi in their Afcon qualifier. The new coach, Rigobert Song, a veteran of four World Cups as a player, has a chance of guiding a talented squad into the knockout stages, which Cameroon have not reached since 1990.\n23) Iran\nOptimism is not especially high that Iran, who will face England and Wales, are on track to cause a stir. They topped their qualifying group by seeing off the lesser sides, losing to South Korea, and look more solid than spectacular under Dragan Skocic. A friendly defeat by Algeria was underwhelming; they do, though, have dangerous forwards in Sardar Azmoun and Mehdi Taremi if opponents doze off.\n24) Tunisia\nThe Carthage Eagles have not conceded a goal in six matches since being knocked out of the Africa Cup of Nations in January and they swept aside Japan impressively on Tuesday to win the Kirin Cup in Osaka. But they will need to be at their very best to trouble France and Denmark in Group D having never made it past the group stages in five previous appearances at the World Cup.\n\n25) Japan\nThe surprise 3-0 defeat by Tunisia in Tuesday\u2019s Kirin Cup final was a worrying sign for the Blue Samurai after a run of eight wins from their previous 10 matches. But Hajime Moriyasu\u2019s side showed what they are capable of in last week\u2019s impressive 4-1 win over Ghana and the narrow loss to Brazil.\n26) Ecuador\nUnbeaten in this month\u2019s friendlies having reached their fourth World Cup, Ecuador were relieved to hear that Fifa had dismissed claims by Chile that they had fielded an ineligible player in the qualifiers. \u201cWe celebrate it more because we felt humiliated,\u201d said the federation president, Francisco Egas. \u201cWe felt trampled by the great media campaign from the Chilean federation.\u201d\n27) Ghana\nBlack Stars supporters will be salivating over the prospect of gaining revenge over Uruguay in their World Cup group after the bad memories of the 2010 quarter-final. But the heavy defeat by Japan last week was a reminder that Ghana have their work cut out to make it into the last 16 in Qatar despite their heroics in beating Nigeria to qualification.\n28) South Korea\nA mixed bag of results from recent friendlies that included a 5-1 thrashing by Brazil before they beat 10-man Chile and drew with Paraguay. Not fancied by most to progress through a difficult-looking group that contains Portugal, Uruguay and Ghana but with Son Heung-min on their side, don\u2019t put it past them.\n29) Costa Rica\nLos Ticos\u2019s priceless third-minute goal in the playoff against New Zealand from the former Arsenal forward Joel Campbell was enough to secure their place in Qatar after missing out to the US on goal difference during qualifying. A traditionally miserly defence that has helped Costa Rica win nine of 10 matches since last November will have its hands full trying to contain Germany and Spain in Group E, however.\n\n30) Qatar\nGiven the resources piled into preparing Qatar\u2019s national team, expectations \u2013 such as they are in a country with scant football culture \u2013 should be relatively high. They will hope guest appearances at the 2019 Copa Am\u00e9rica and last year\u2019s Concacaf Gold Cup, along with various prestige friendlies around the globe, were not for nothing. Given they won the Asian Cup three years ago F\u00e9lix S\u00e1nchez\u2019s side should not be written off but they have a difficult draw.\n31) Australia\nShowed great fortitude to come through playoffs against the United Arab Emirates and Peru, beating the South American side thanks to an inspired performance from the substitute goalkeeper Andrew Redmayne in the penalty shootout. The coach, Graham Arnold, will hope they can maintain that momentum after a disappointing qualification campaign that saw the Socceroos struggle for consistency.\n32) Saudi Arabia\nTwo 1-0 defeats by Colombia and Venezuela this month will not inspire much confidence as Saudi Arabia prepare to face the might of Argentina in their opening match.

The global media company agreed a 12-year deal with rugby league\u2019s powerbrokers in May in an attempt to revolutionise the game on and off the field, with a licensing system set to replace conventional promotion and relegation for Super League by 2025. IMG\u2019s vice president for sports management, Matt Dwyer, says that capturing the attention of people in London and developing the sport in the city is firmly among their priorities after their research showed it ranks better than traditional rugby league cities in areas such as participation and interest. The belief that London can become a success was heightened by England\u2019s World Cup semi-final against Samoa at the Emirates Stadium in November, when the majority of those in attendance came from the capital. Dwyer stressed that while the plans will take time, London has the potential to become a rugby league powerhouse in the years ahead. \u201cThe thing that surprised us is when we looked at all the data, you took the names off the cities and looked at participation, interest and a few other metrics, London was at the top and I don\u2019t think anyone would have guessed that,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re all sitting there thinking there\u2019s a sleeping giant here: we\u2019re not saying London for the sake of it because it\u2019s London. We\u2019re saying it because there\u2019s a future here and the metrics we\u2019ve seen suggest it.\u201d Rugby league has tried to have a strong professional presence in London before. While London Broncos were a fixture in Super League for a prolonged period, they are now a part-time club playing in the sport\u2019s second tier, the Championship. London Skolars play in the level below, League 1. Dwyer appeared to rule out creating a new London club but warned rugby league must learn from its past failings when it comes to the capital.  \u201cThe demographic from both participation and interest is very positive but we are going to need a club that\u2019s competitive,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m keen to work with both clubs. But the step we\u2019re at now is revisiting the past and working out what we can learn from that. \u201cIt\u2019s still very early days. It\u2019s a long-term project, we\u2019re not going to be able to click our fingers and 20,000 people will turn up to watch the Broncos. But it\u2019s got the right foundations.\u201d"

                    "body": "At least Rob Green can laugh about it now. \u201cI was doing the school run when I found out England had drawn USA in their group at the World Cup,\u201d the former goalkeeper wrote in the Mail on Sunday this week. \u201cI had just enough time to send one tweet, with one emoji, a pair of eyes. As if to say: \u2018Well this is awkward.\u2019\u201d\nBut despite his blunder that helped the United States hold Fabio Capello\u2019s side to a 1-1 draw in their opening match in 2010, Green \u2013 who is working as a pundit for BBC radio in Qatar \u2013 is not the only England goalkeeper to have bitter memories of facing them at a World Cup.\nA few months before that last meeting at a World Cup, Bert Williams, who conceded the only goal of the game when the two countries met in Brazil in 1950, said: \u201cIt\u2019s been 60 years. It\u2019s taken a lot of forgetting as far as I am concerned.\u201d\n\nDespite being more than 72 years in the past, that victory in Belo Horizonte is acknowledged as one of the biggest shocks in the tournament\u2019s history. Stanley Matthews later said: \u201cI thanked my lucky stars I hadn\u2019t been a part of it,\u201d having been controversially left out of the starting lineup after missing England\u2019s opening game against Chile.\nEven though they reached the semi-finals of the inaugural World Cup in 1930, it was the first time the United States had faced England, who were highly fancied as they featured Billy Wright, Tom Finney and Stan Mortensen. By contrast, all of the US team were amateurs while their goalkeeper, Frank Borghi, was a former baseball player who needed his defenders to take the goal-kicks because he never kicked the ball.\nHowever, an inspired performance from Borghi \u2013 who drove a hearse for his day job \u2013 somehow managed to keep England at bay. \u201cFor the first 20 minutes, England were all over us. I think they hit the woodwork,\u201d said the USA\u2019s Walter Bahr in an interview with the Guardian in 2010. \u201cAs the game went on, England began to get desperate.\u201d\n\nThe winning goal, in the 38th minute, was scored by Joe Gaetjens \u2013 a Haiti-born dishwasher from New York who went on to play professionally in France \u2013 even if there remains a debate if he meant it. \u201cIt should have been 10-1,\u201d Williams said in 2009. \u201cThe American team turned up wearing sombreros, smoking cigars and they only had about six kicks of the ball in 90 minutes. Unfortunately, one of them took a big deflection and wrongfooted me for the winning goal.\u201d\nHis memory has been disputed by several American players, including Bahr, who took the shot. \u201cHe didn\u2019t get a clean head at it, but he definitely made a concerted effort,\u201d Bahr said. \u201cJoe was a guy who had a nose for the goal. He scored goals where you didn\u2019t know how he got to the ball, let alone scored the goals.\u201d\nGaetjens\u2019s life ended in tragedy after being arrested in Haiti, in July 1964, by the Tonton Macoute, the militia of the dictator Fran\u00e7ois \u201cPapa Doc\u201d Duvalier. He was never seen again.\n\nOnly two members of the American side \u2013 Bahr and the defender Harry Keough \u2013 faced England in their next meeting, three years later in a friendly at Yankee Stadium in New York. A few months before they suffered defeat by the same scoreline against Hungary, two goals from Nat Lofthouse sealed a 6-3 win for the visitors. It was the start of a series of one-sided contests including a 10-0 thumping in 1964 as the United States struggled on the international stage.\nThe two countries did not meet again until 1985 in Los Angeles, when two goals apiece from Gary Lineker and Kerry Dixon sealed a 5-0 win for England. But with the USA having failed until 1990 to qualify for the World Cup after their exploits in Brazil, the 2-0 win over Graham Taylor\u2019s side in the US Cup a year before the 1994 tournament on home soil was the springboard for making it through the group stages for the first time since 1930.\nThe match in Boston also included Paul Ince becoming England\u2019s first black captain, a significant moment the midfielder later said led to him being sent \u201cletters from people who weren\u2019t even into football\u201d. \u201cThey\u2019d written to me saying, \u2018We have got kids who come from the kind of background you\u2019ve come from. You captaining the country is a shining light for our children.\u2019\u201d\nAlan Shearer\u2019s double did for Bora Milutinovic\u2019s side on their first visit to Wembley in September 1994 and the United States have still to score in three visits to London \u2013 most recently in a 3-0 defeat in November 2018. But after Clint Dempsey\u2019s goal in Rustenburg embarrassed Green and the story of Belo Horizonte, Jordan Pickford should be wary of taking anything for granted this time around."

                    "body": "Argentinian television is calling it La Copa de Batacazos: a World Cup of bumps, surprises and the unforeseeable. They\u2019ve come thick and fast on this tiny Gulf peninsula over the past two weeks, with a record seven teams ranked in the top 20 of Fifa\u2019s world rankings, including Germany, crashing out at the group stage. The United States entered Saturday night\u2019s knockout match with the Netherlands confident they could deliver the latest plot twist in a competition where outsiders have consistently punched above their weight. Instead, their dream is over in disappointingly predictable fashion thanks to shortcomings that have become all too familiar. It was the same old story for the Americans, who finished with more shots (17 to 11), more shots on target (eight to six), more passes (564 to 412) and a greater share of possession (58% to 42%), but lacked the ruthlessness and professional edge of the Dutch, who improved to 19 matches unbeaten since Louis van Gaal took over after last year\u2019s European Championship.  The Americans\u2019 profligacy from promising attacking positions, their imprecision in building chances from possession and their consistently poor set-pieces all came under a harsh glare on the world stage after persisting through an often-rocky World Cup qualifying campaign. For three matches in Qatar they were able to make up the difference with closely knit team play fueled by boundless energy in midfield. But when the reserves ran dry on Saturday night, their defects finally caught up with them. The controlled and efficient presence of the Tyler Adams-Weston McKennie-Yunus Musah midfield that embodied the Americans\u2019 biggest strength and source of optimism against the favored Dutch was badly misfiring. Any concerns that they had left it all on the field during the group stage were confirmed in the first quarter-hour. Adams was nowhere near Memphis Depay on the first goal, McKennie was replaced before the hour mark and Musah looked spent from the word go, making poor giveaways that led to a number of Dutch chances. Physical and mental fatigue were working hand in hand.  That troubling collaboration was in full view early on, when the Dutch midfielder Frenkie de Jong dropped in between two center-backs to collect the ball before starting a sequence of 20 uninterrupted passes over 114 seconds, leaving the American press in ribbons before Depay finished crisply from a Denzel Dumfries cross to punctuate a pass-and-move masterclass. Suddenly the only team to not concede from open play in the group stage was trailing for the first time in their tournament. At times they looked tactically overwhelmed against a Dutch side pressing insanely high, daring the Americans to make them pay. \u201cWhen you look at the difference between the two teams, to me, there was some offensive finishing quality that Holland had that we\u2019re lacking a little bit,\u201d Berhalter said. \u201cWe have a very young group. We have players that are beginning their careers and they\u2019re going to catch up to that. They\u2019re going to get the same thing.\u201d The Americans did well to get their feet under them. But when Daley Blind found acres of space at the post after eluding Sergi\u00f1o Dest, the Ajax midfielder scored to effectively close the show against opponents who have wanted mightily for goals against world-class sides. The US didn\u2019t make a whole lot of mistakes on Saturday. But when they did, the Netherlands punished them. \u201cThe first half was a great indication of the game being about moments. We were on top for a lot of the first half and two moments come and all of a sudden we\u2019re 2-0 down. The message was soccer can be cruel sometimes,\u201d said Berhalter. \u201cIt\u2019s just moments that the players were [switched] off a little bit here and there and it ends up in the back of the net. When you play at this level, against high quality opponents, that\u2019s what happens. It\u2019s unfortunate that it happens in the knockout game, but it did and we\u2019ve got to learn from it.\u201d Now for the good news. At a time when more young US players than ever before are spending their teenage years in Europe, more than half of Berhalter\u2019s 26-man squad compete in the world\u2019s top five leagues, including Pulisic (Chelsea), Dest (Milan), McKennie (Juventus) and Adams (Leeds United), who departs as one of the revelations of the tournament. Nineteen of them made their World Cup debuts over the past fortnight \u2013 a record for a US team by some distance \u2013 and all of them got a taste of the knockout cauldron.  They started three of the youngest starting XIs in this tournament and four of the youngest five. Eight of Berhalter\u2019s choices for the Netherlands match were 25 or younger. For once the breathless chatter over an American golden generation doesn\u2019t feel like promotional bluster. And the next time they play a World Cup match will be on home soil. Even though Berhalter resisted the notion that his youth movement was designed at least in part with 2026 in mind, the fact remains that today\u2019s core players will be in their presumptive primes when the US will be co-hosts. \u201cI think this group is closer,\u201d Berhalter said. \u201cCan we win against top teams? Can we perform well against top teams well enough to win? Today is a strange type of outcome in a game like this when we perform really well, especially in the first half. But to be fielding the youngest lineups in the World Cup four times in a row and still be able to play the way we are, the American public should be optimistic.\u201d"

                    "body": "Serbia supporters displayed fascist slogans and aimed racist chants towards ethnic Albanians during their side\u2019s match against Switzerland on Friday night, according to an eyewitness account given to the Observer.\nThe scenes at Stadium 974 in Doha, where Switzerland won 3-2 to secure a last-16 place in a match that spilled over during the second half, raise questions about Fifa\u2019s stewarding and in particular its apparent tolerance of offensive insignia. Hasan Rrahmani arrived at the match wearing an Albanian flag around his neck but says he had it confiscated at the entrance while derogatory nationalist symbols were allowed through. He says he was shown a WhatsApp message that Fifa had sent to security staff containing pictures of items, pictures and phrases that were not allowed.\n\u201cI was completely dumbfounded to see the number of fascist slogans, T-shirts and flags,\u201d Rrahmani said. He has shown the Observer photographic evidence of a supporter wearing a green hat closely associated with atrocities committed in the Kosovan and Bosnian wars, and says the man was part of a group in the same attire. Among other items of clothing worn freely around the stadium, he says, were T-shirts reading \u201cFrom Serbia to Tokyo\u201d, a nationalist slogan employed by Serbian football fans invoked during the wars of the 90s. Rrahmani says police were not interested in complaints relating to the items, or to three-fingered gestures considered offensive in many contexts.\n\nFifa may find the supporters\u2019 chants more straightforward to deal with, having issued a public address message in the 77th minute asking for \u201cdiscriminatory chants and gestures\u201d to cease. Rrahmani says those were audible from an early stage of the evening. \u201cI was shocked at the vitriol, absolutely dumbfounded,\u201d he says. \u201cThey were singing the most vile racist chants.\u201d\nAmong those he says he heard were songs involving the word \u201c\u0160iptar\u201d, a well-known derogatory term used against Albanians, and a call-and-response routine of \u201cKill, kill, kill the Albanians\u201d. Fans also sang \u201cKosovo is the heart of Serbia\u201d, related to their country\u2019s refusal to recognise Kosovan independence, he says. \u201cIt would start in one corner and the rest of the fans would pick it up,\u201d Rrahmani said. Such songs are not unfamiliar at matches where tensions between Serbia and Albania have ignited, including the infamous \u201cdrone\u201d game in October 2014 when a Euro 2016 qualifier in Belgrade spiralled into chaos.\nRrahmani describes retrieving his flag from a collection point after the game, and also seeing Serbs being handed back some confiscated items. He describes being set upon by \u201cseven or eight\u201d Serbia supporters upon exiting the stadium area. \u201cThey shoved me, saying: \u2018Go fuck yourself \u0160iptar,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cThey threw water at me. I tried to walk away but seven or eight big blokes followed me. In the end I ran towards the police, who didn\u2019t do anything. Everything that happened around the evening was just frightening. What I expected to be a good night rekindled all those memories of the past that I thought had gone.\u201d He says the police were polite and reassuring but let the group walk away.\nSerbia are already under investigation by Fifa for displaying a flag showing Kosovo as part of their territory, along with the words \u201cWe do not surrender\u201d, in their dressing room before facing Brazil last week. Rrahmani says similar flags were visible inside the ground.\n\u201cFifa\u2019s inconsistency shocks me,\u201d he says. \u201cHow on earth, in 2022, can you allow fans in a World Cup stadium to shout about killing another nation? I came away feeling marginalised and not welcomed by Fifa.\u201d\nRrahmani emphasises that this was an anomaly in an otherwise enjoyable experience at World Cup stadiums. He was born in Kosovo and lives in London; he has been following England and Wales in Qatar but attended Friday\u2019s match to support Xherdan Shaqiri and Granit Xhaka, Switzerland players who have Kosovan roots. Their goal celebrations in the same fixture at Russia 2018, forming Albanian \u201ceagle\u201d symbols with their hands, caused controversy and set much of the context for the second-half scenes in Doha.\nXhaka could face investigation for grabbing his genitals in front of the Serbia bench and other figures from both camps may fear censure. An Albania fan was seen being escorted from the stadium during the second half after making the eagle gesture.\nFifa declined to comment about the prospects of disciplinary action or on the issues described by Rrahmani."

                    "body": "How do you stop a force such as Kylian Mbapp\u00e9? It is the question that will have been whirring around the mind of Gareth Southgate since England teed up a quarter-final date with France and will no doubt consume Kyle Walker, who is likely to have the thankless task of trying to contain the forward on Saturday. Mbapp\u00e9\u2019s touch maps and goals tally at this tournament suggest Walker is going to be in for a busy evening.\nIt is a conundrum Matty Cash no longer has to concern himself with but one he spent a good while thinking about before Poland\u2019s last-16 defeat by France on Sunday. \u201cI spent the afternoon watching his clips and I knew it was going to be a tough test, but when he gets the ball, stops and moves, he\u2019s the quickest thing I\u2019ve ever seen,\u201d the Aston Villa defender, says. \u201cI said to him at the end: \u2018Can I have your shirt?\u2019 and he gave me his match-worn shirt so I\u2019m delighted with that.\u201d\nWhat is the difference between mapping out how to halt Mbapp\u00e9 while studying footage of him and trying to stifle the real thing on the pitch? \u201cI\u2019m watching the videos while lying in bed,\u201d Cash says, laughing. \u201cIn real life he\u2019s burning my legs \u2013that\u2019s the difference. It\u2019s a massive difference. When he stands you up and moves he does it really well. He drops the shoulder, goes short then long. I got into a couple of races with him and I did all right. You look over your shoulder and he\u2019s there.\u201d\n\nMbapp\u00e9 is enjoying himself in Qatar, where a beaming smile is seemingly permanently etched across his face. He is on track to win the Golden Boot, clocking up speeds of 35kmh and generally tormenting defenders. He rattled in two goals against Poland to take his tally at this tournament to five and to nine in 11 World Cup appearances, surpassing Pel\u00e9\u2019s 57-year record for the most World Cup goals before the age of 24, a birthday Mbapp\u00e9 celebrates two days after the final. He has scored as many World Cup goals as Lionel Messi and one more than Cristiano Ronaldo, who have played at five finals. It is why Hugo Lloris says limits do not apply to Mbapp\u00e9, a player \u201ccapable of breaking all records\u201d.\nOlivier Giroud, who broke France\u2019s goalscoring record in victory against Poland, said some of England\u2019s players predicted meeting France in the quarter-finals. In the coming days Cash says he will probably speak to Jack Grealish, his former Villa teammate, and Declan Rice about getting to grips with Mbapp\u00e9.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t need any tips,\u201d he says. \u201cThey\u2019ve got Kyle Walker who can play right-back and he\u2019s probably just as quick as Mbapp\u00e9. He knows Mbapp\u00e9 is amazing but Kyle is England\u2019s best right-back. So if anyone\u2019s going to stop Mbapp\u00e9, Kyle is the man to stop him. I said before that [Raheem] Sterling was my toughest opponent \u2013 when we faced Manchester City, he was brilliant. Sterling\u2019s rapid, but Mbapp\u00e9 is electric.\u201d\nMbapp\u00e9, understandably, left Cash in a quandary at times and he quickly discovered there is often no right answer. \u201cI didn\u2019t know whether to drop off or go tight and when I went tight he just spun in behind. I did everything I could. \n\u201cWhen it was one v one I thought I\u2019d done OK against him, he didn\u2019t really run me once. There were times where he got space on the counterattack, which is where he scored the second goal, and that\u2019s where he hurts teams.\u201d\nFor Walker and England, the task is clear and when Cash gets home his first job will be to clear some space on his walls. Four days before duelling with Mbapp\u00e9 and departing with his No 10 shirt, Cash snaffled another memento. Emiliano Mart\u00ednez, the Argentina goalkeeper and Cash\u2019s Villa clubmate, arranged for Cash to get Messi\u2019s shirt after Poland\u2019s defeat by Argentina. \n\u201cPlaying against Messi and Mbapp\u00e9 in the space of four days is a learning curve,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s a boy\u2019s dream to play in a major tournament against these types of players, and to get their shirts.\u201d"

                    "body": "Who says Scotland aren\u2019t going to the World Cup? The country\u2019s World Cup drought might have extended to 24 years when they failed to qualify for the 2022 edition, but that doesn\u2019t mean Scotland isn\u2019t being represented at football\u2019s global showpiece in Qatar. Instead of their navy blue, Scotland\u2019s representation will come with a green and gold hue. The Socceroos\u2019 current squad not only reflects the changing face of Australian society and more recent migration patterns through the likes of Thomas Deng, Garang Kuol, Awer Mabil and Keanu Baccus, it also strongly reflects those of a previous era with a more Anglo-Celtic persuasion.  In Scotland-born trio Harry Souttar, Martin Boyle and Jason Cummings \u2013 all eligible for the Socceroos through their parents \u2013 there are three players who are probably more Scottish than they are Australian. In fact, neither Souttar nor Boyle had stepped foot on Australian soil before pulling on a green and gold shirt. There has always been a strong connection between the two countries, given the deep colonial roots of modern Australia, especially when it comes to football. Poetically, as Australia\u2019s celebrates the centenary of its national team, there were three Scotland-born players in Australia\u2019s first ever national team squad in 1922 \u2013 William McBride and Dave and Jock Cumberford (although when you include Australia\u2019s first captain, Alec Gibb, born in Ireland but Scottish, there were four). A century later, as the Socceroos prepare for their sixth World Cup appearance, there is another strong Scottish presence in Graham Arnold\u2019s 26-man squad. The more things change the more they stay the same.  Further, across the 100-year history of the Socceroos there have been 115 Scotland-born players out of 954 to have received a cap. That number becomes even more significant when you consider there have been 392 overseas-born Socceroos. Almost one-third of them are from Scotland.  Some of them are the nation\u2019s most iconic football figures, such as Jimmy Mackay who scored the winning goal against South Korea in 1973 to send Australia to their first ever World Cup. There were three Scotland-born players in that 1974 World Cup squad, including legendary goalkeeper Jack Reilly. Fast forward to 1985 and the two nations met in a World Cup playoff, with the Scotland team sheet featuring names such as Kenny Dalglish, Gordon Strachan, Alex McLeish, Graeme Souness and Steve Nicol, with Alex Ferguson as coach. Australia, meanwhile, had Scotland-born players in strikers David Mitchell and Kenny Murphy, defender Robbie Dunn and Hakoah midfielder Joe Watson. The Scots won to qualify for Mexico 1986 despite a 0-0 draw in Melbourne. In fact, a year later in Watson\u2019s final appearance for the Socceroos, he was replaced by a Ange Postecoglou, then just 20 years old. Which brings us to the modern-day connection between the two nations at a professional level. Postecoglou is the most notable and high-profile example of the recent football exchange, even if he did land in Scotland via Japan. Australian players have always plied their trade in Scotland \u2013 think of the likes of Craig Moore, Kevin Muscat, Scott McDonald and Tony Vidmar \u2013 but there has been a boom in the past 12 months with a growing number choosing Scotland as their entry point to European football. Aside from Boyle, there are a further six in the World Cup squad who are currently playing in Scotland \u2013 Aziz Behich, Nathaniel Atkinson, Kye Rowles, Aaron Mooy, Keanu Baccus and Cameron Devlin.  Meanwhile Jackson Irvine and Jamie Maclaren have Scottish fathers and have both previously played professionally in Scotland. Maclaren even turned out for Scotland\u2019s youth national teams before declaring his allegiance to Australia. That is almost half of the 26-man squad with a Scottish connection. And there are more, such as Ryan Strain, Dylan McGowan, Phillip Cancar, Lewis Miller and Mark Birighitti who call the Scottish Premiership home. It\u2019s a trend that will only continue, according to one of the finest Socceroos to play in Scotland, former Rangers hero Craig Moore. \u201cI\u2019m reconnecting with a lot of clubs here,\u201d Moore told the Keepup website earlier this year. \u201cA lot of them now are starting to look at Australia again, which is fantastic to hear because I feel as if this is a really good platform for the Australian players. \u201cIt\u2019s a competitive league. It doesn\u2019t matter whether you\u2019ve got 5,000 or you got 60,000, there\u2019s an atmosphere, you\u2019re tested, there\u2019s the pressure, the culture. For me, it is a really good platform to take your game to the next level.\u201d With Brexit forcing clubs to change the way they recruit, and with the success of the existing Scotland-based Socceroos doing wonders for the reputation of Australian players, the Scottish-Australian connection is expected to live long into the future."

                    "body": "If the next evolutionary phase of Gareth Southgate\u2019s football is truly upon us then it is Jude Bellingham who is making it possible. At Euro 2020 England lined up with two deep midfielders, Declan Rice and Kalvin Phillips, sitting and protecting the defence.\nIn Qatar, it is different. Rice is still there, giving others the chance to shine with his efficient passing and positional discipline, but partnering him now is a teenage sensation with the potential to shatter all the accusations of Southgate as too cautious and pragmatic.\nBellingham is a gamechanger for England\u2019s coach. The 19\u2011year\u2011old was astonishingly good when England opened their World Cup by crushing Iran 6-2 on Monday. It was Bellingham\u2019s first start in a tournament, but it was impossible to detect any nerves. This is a young talent who knows that he belongs.\nBellingham is starring for Borussia Dortmund in the Champions League and his brilliance against Iran suggested he has every intention of taking this World Cup by storm.\n\nDortmund\u2019s latest whiz\u2011kid does not really do doubts. He has scored big Champions League goals and was everywhere against Iran. His first touch, a crossfield pass to the right for Kieran Trippier, was a sign of easy confidence. His maturity was evident in the way he tracked back to halt counterattacks. The quality was there when he speared a pass through to Callum Wilson to set up Jack Grealish for England\u2019s sixth goal.\n\u201cWe have played together four or five times now,\u201d Rice said of his midfield partner. \u201cI said to him in the tunnel: \u2018This is your stage, go and flourish. I\u2019ll be there behind you to sweep up and give you the ball for you to go and do your thing.\u2019 I know my role. I am there to stand in front of the back four, protect, get on the ball and move it around.\u201d\nYet it is not the case that Bellingham wanders off and leaves Rice isolated at the base of midfield. He may be a kid, but he understands the game. It is not an exaggeration to say England have a complete and very modern box-to\u2011box midfielder. Bellingham is part of the collective. He was perfectly happy dropping back to defend against Iran and perfectly capable of stepping in to win the ball back.\nEqually it is what he did in Iran\u2019s half that grabbed the attention. Everyone had anticipated a slog. After the anxieties of a fraught Nations League campaign, would it be a repeat of that deathly goalless draw with Algeria at the 2010 World Cup?\n\nNot with Bellingham around. He gives England\u2019s midfield new angles and possibilities. The idea of Southgate as a defensive manager has always felt reductive \u2013 he wants control and believes clean sheets win international tournaments \u2013 but the emergence of Bellingham has made England less predictable. Take the opening goal against Iran. At the risk of stating the obvious, it would not have happened if Phillips had started instead of Bellingham. That willingness to burst into the box, to drive through the lines and disrupt Iran\u2019s organisation, would not have come from Phillips, who is goalless in his 23 appearances for England.\nThis is not to argue that Phillips, who has been excellent for England, will not have a role to play during this tournament. But Bellingham is on another level. There are so many facets to his game and the way he met Luke Shaw\u2019s cross to give England the lead with a looping header was a clear example of his potential to make Southgate\u2019s approach far more effective against negative opponents.\n\nNow there will be comparisons to former English greats. There is the hunger for goals that marked out Frank Lampard, the insistent power of Paul Ince, the technical ability of Paul Scholes and the imagination of Paul Gascoigne. Older fans will think of Bryan Robson\u2019s bravery. Then there is the athleticism of Steven Gerrard, though the former Liverpool captain never quite had the discipline, or indeed the managers, to be truly effective at international level.\n\nSo perhaps we have to look further afield. And if we are talking about the complete box-to-box midfielders, then perhaps the player who really comes to mind is the former Germany captain Michael Ballack. The leap for the first goal was very Ballack. But so was Bellingham\u2019s command of the position, the way he puffed out his chest, won his tackles, got around the pitch and played with his head up, ensuring that Iran had no way of containing England.\nWith Mason Mount counter-pressing and linking play further forward, there was a nice balance to Southgate\u2019s midfield. Bellingham grew in stature after he became England\u2019s second-youngest scorer at a World Cup and was soon rolling through the challenges to combine with Harry Kane when the captain set up Raheem Sterling for the third goal.\nIt is all good news for Kane. Southgate has often relied on him and Sterling for goals, but there is another threat for defenders to think about now. They know Bellingham will be coming at some point. They will try to stop him but in this instance the hype looks justified. Bellingham is a star, a marketing dream, who will be coveted by every top club in Europe next summer, and his emergence has given Southgate every reason to dream."

                    "body": "Listen, mortals, the sacred cry. Freedom, freedom, freedom. Suddenly, there it was, there he was, and it was all let out. In a moment, a flash of that left boot, Lionel Messi was liberated and so were they, released with a single shot. All around this place, thousands of Argentinians absolutely lost it. Below them, so did Argentina\u2019s captain, clinging hard to his last chance. He wasn\u2019t going to let this end yet. Not just this game, not just this World Cup, but all of it.\nIt was too early for that, even as it started to feel late at Lusail, time slipping away. Perhaps the greatest career football has ever seen was drawing to a close, and like that. Quietly, sadly, no last dance, a failure to finish. Argentina knew that they needed to beat Mexico to continue and at times it felt like football needed them to win too, but an hour had gone and nothing had happened until it happened. The response, the bloody roar, felt like the world had willed it.\n\nGiven the ball and a yard of grass, Messi controlled and struck it low into the far corner. The shot was superb, but seen a thousand times; what followed may not have been seen once, perhaps comparable only to the Copa Am\u00e9rica final. He sprinted off wildly, a hint of Marco Tardelli to him, teammates chasing, leapt into \u00c1ngel Di Mar\u00eda\u2019s arms, then disappeared beneath the bodies. On the bench, Pablo Aimar, the assistant coach who is Messi\u2019s idol, covered his face and cried.\n\nBy the time Messi appeared again, those looked like tears reaching for the surface of his eyes, which were gone. He stood arms wide, blowing kisses, shouting, out of it. This was a moment unlike any other and it lingered. Then he looked to the sky and spoke. To Maradona perhaps? Or Cecilia, the grandmother to whom almost all of his 788 goals have been dedicated.\nThey have not always held him like they did with Diego Maradona, who passed away two years and one day ago, but now they could not love him any more.\nThose three consecutive finals lost have at last been understood as a reason to embrace him, not reject him. Argentina\u2019s success at the 2021 Copa Am\u00e9rica was celebrated not just as their first trophy in 28 years, but almost an act of justice.\nWhen the final whistle had gone then, Messi slipped to his knees and sobbed, teammates running to him, as if what mattered was not so much the country as their captain.\n\u201cHalf the world would have run to hug him,\u201d the manager, Lionel Scaloni, said and there was something in that which was played out in Qatar: there are countless Argentinians here but there are more Argentina fans; they came from everywhere to see him. They came to see this.\n\nAfter that Copa Am\u00e9rica, Messi felt liberated, the coach said. And yet that embrace carried a hint of regret still, the desire for the ultimate story and the belief now that it could be told: winning this World Cup, his last.\nIt hadn\u2019t started well. Argentina arrived unbeaten in 36 and then lost. It was not just that they might not win after all; they might not get through the first round. They had lost to Saudi Arabia, for goodness sake. It would be, it was suggested, the greatest catastrophe in their World Cup history. And maybe that wasn\u2019t as absurd as it may have sounded. For Messi, it would have felt like it. That probably sounds ridiculous too, but go out here, and there would be nothing left, ever. The sun will come up tomorrow, Scaloni is fond of saying, but for Messi the footballer, it would not.\n\nAnd as the night that could be his last went on, that felt increasingly plausible. Scaloni has always sought to remove the fear, remind them football is a game, there to be enjoyed, not endured. But how could they?\nThere were too few signs of life, until Messi started to drive from deep early in the second half. Until, at last, the first shot came, and it was his. The second, Enzo Fern\u00e1ndez\u2019s brilliant curler, finally released the tension. For four days at least. There was relief, a shot at redemption still. Before the game, Argentina\u2019s players had sung the national anthem: listen, mortals, the sacred cry; freedom, freedom, freedom. Then they stood for a photo, the tension on their faces captured forever. Behind them, staff wheeled away a giant inflatable World Cup. Messi wouldn\u2019t let them take the real one, not yet."

                    "body": "Good morning. The Democratic incumbent, Raphael Warnock, has fended off a challenge from Republican Herschel Walker and won the Georgia Senate runoff, securing his first full term and delivering a 51st seat to bolster his party\u2019s majority in the chamber. The Associated Press called the race about three-and-a-half hours after polls closed in Georgia, as Warnock led Walker, by approximately 40,000 votes. Shortly after that, Warnock took the stage at his campaign\u2019s victory party to thank his supporters. A pastor at the Atlanta church where Martin Luther King Jr once preached, Warnock has held one of Georgia\u2019s two Senate seats since winning a special election in 2021. As he began his remarks in Atlanta, supporters chanted: \u201cSix more years!\u201d Warnock told the crowd: \u201cAfter a hard-fought campaign \u2013 or should I say campaigns \u2013 it is my honor to utter the four most powerful words ever spoken in a democracy: the people have spoken.\u201d  How did Walker respond? Walker conceded, acknowledging that his campaign had fallen short and expressing gratitude to his team. The Republican explicitly thanked election officials who ensured the runoff was managed effectively, quelling concerns he might refuse to accept the result. Is Walker\u2019s loss a bad omen for Trumpism? In a normal political universe, David Smith writes, Walker\u2019s defeat would be the final nail in Trump\u2019s political coffin. The former American football star was the ultimate Trumpian candidate. Trump, however, arguably remains the favourite for the Republican nomination in 2024. The next election could spell the rebirth or the death of Trumpism.  Trump Organization guilty of tax fraud, New York jury finds  A jury in New York has convicted the Trump Organization of criminal tax fraud in a stinging rebuke of the former US president\u2019s company. Although Donald Trump was not personally on trial, prosecutors in the case brought by the Manhattan district attorney insisted he was fully aware of the long-running scheme in which they said executives were enriched by off-the-books perks to make up for lower salaries, reducing the company\u2019s tax liabilities. \u201cThis was a case about greed and cheating,\u201d Alvin Bragg, the Manhattan district attorney, said in a statement celebrating the guilty verdict. \u201cIn Manhattan, no corporation is above the law.\u201d The 12-person jury in New York\u2019s state court was sent out to deliberate on Monday morning after a six-week trial in which Trump Organization lawyers pinned blame for the fraud solely on the greed of longtime chief financial officer Allen Weisselberg.  How has Trump responded? In a statement yesterday, the Trump Organization denounced the verdict, which could carry a fine of up to $1.6m, a relatively negligible sum for such a large company though it could affect future business dealings. A lawyer for the Trump Organization vowed to appeal.  German police raids target far-right extremists \u2018seeking to overthrow state\u2019  Twenty-five people including a 71-year-old German aristocrat, a retired military commander and former MP for the far-right Alternative f\u00fcr Deutschland (AfD) have been detained in Germany on suspicion of a terrorist plan to overthrow the state and re-negotiate the country\u2019s post-second world war settlement. Thousands of police carried out a series of raids across Germany on Wednesday morning in connection with the far-right ring. Federal prosecutors said 3,000 officers had conducted searches at 130 sites in 11 of Germany\u2019s 16 states against the group, whose members it said adhered to a \u201cconglomerate of conspiracy theories\u201d including the QAnon cult and the so-called Reich Citizens movement. Prosecutors said 22 German citizens had been detained on suspicion of \u201cmembership in a terrorist organisation\u201d. Three other detainees, including a female Russian citizen, were suspected of supporting the organisation, they said.  Who is behind the ring? German media have identified as the group\u2019s ringleaders as Heinrich XIII, 71, a descendant of the noble Reu\u00df family that used to rule over parts of eastern Germany in the 12th century, and a former senior field officer at the German army\u2019s paratrooper battalion named only as R\u00fcdiger von P.

A US judge has dismissed a lawsuit against Saudi Arabia\u2019s Mohammed bin Salman that claimed he conspired to kill the journalist Jamal Khashoggi, saying the crown prince was entitled to sovereign immunity despite \u201ccredible allegations\u201d that he was involved in the murder. China\u2019s government has said people with Covid-19 who have mild or no symptoms can quarantine at home, in a significant shift towards living with the virus.

World Cup 2022: A beautiful day for Morocco as the quarter-final ties are set  The round of 16 in Qatar had progressed smoothly and with a distinct lack of upsets until Tuesday. That all changed when Morocco knocked out 2010 champions Spain in a penalty shootout, in which the visibly nervous Spanish players failed to convert a single kick. Spain are making a habit of this: they went out at this stage in the last World Cup on penalties, too. Morocco are only the fourth African team to reach the quarter-finals of the World Cup and the first since Ghana in 2010. Their fans were understandably ecstatic. The day\u2019s other game was slightly less tense as Portugal thrashed Switzerland 6-1. It was a formidable performance from the Portuguese and all the more remarkable given that Cristiano Ronaldo, who has dominated the team for nearly two decades, was benched before the game. How did his replacement, 21-year-old Gon\u00e7alo Ramos, fare? He scored a brilliant hat-trick. Elsewhere at the World Cup  There are two soccer-free days in Qatar now before the quarter-finals, which take place on Friday and Saturday. First up on Friday is Croatia v Brazil (10am ET) followed by Netherlands v Argentina (2pm ET). Saturday\u2019s first game is Morocco v Portugal (10am) before England v France (2pm ET) rounds things off. There\u2019s been a minor storm around Brazil\u2019s samba-inspired celebrations against South Korea on Monday. The former Ireland midfielder turned TV pundit Roy Keane thought the dancing was disrespectful to the Koreans. That has made Keane very unpopular in Brazil. The Guardian\u2019s Ed Aarons breaks down the intertwined history of soccer and samba in Brazilian life.  Stat of the day: Is Facebook losing its $100bn gamble on virtual reality?  What a difference a year makes. Last October, Facebook supremo Mark Zuckerberg could barely wait to show the world what he was up to as he guided us through his vision for the virtual-reality future. This month, we saw a more subdued Zuckerberg on display: \u201cI wanna say upfront that I take full responsibility for this decision,\u201d he told employees morosely. Meta was laying off 11,000 people \u2013 13% of its workforce. After poor third-quarter results Meta\u2019s share price dropped by 25%, wiping $80bn off the company\u2019s value. Reality Labs, Meta\u2019s metaverse division, has lost $3.7bn in the past three months, with worse expected to come. Don\u2019t miss this: Kirstie Alley was celebrated not because she was flawless \u2013 but because her flaws were so visible  Kirstie Alley was so widely celebrated not because she was flawless but because her flaws were so visible, writes Veronica Esposito \u2013 she was among those celebrities who are compelling because they eschew the carefully managed image of the famous in favour of offering something that feels completely unfiltered and thus far more intimate. Alley achieved prominence at a time when actors such as Roseanne Barr and Rosie O\u2019Donnell courted controversy in large part by defying sexist expectations of how a female celebrity should come off in public life, and how she should portray characters in film and TV.

                    "body": "\nThe main event\nWhile everyone relives the lurid outrage of Luis Su\u00e1rez\u2019s handball against Ghana, the ghost of a different World Cup controversy haunts the other fixture in Group H. South Korea have met Portugal only once before: at the 2002 World Cup, which they co-hosted with Japan. While most expect Fernando Santos\u2019s team to triumph and top the group, the one previous meeting between the two sides ended with the opposite outcome.\nSouth Korea won 1-0 thanks to a goal from Park Ji-sung, the future Manchester United midfielder, which confirmed their status as group winners. Park\u2019s goal was a heartbreaker for the Portuguese: clinging on with nine men, S\u00e9rgio Concei\u00e7\u00e3o was beaten by a clever flick at the near post and V\u00edtor Ba\u00eda allowed Park\u2019s low shot to squirm between his legs to send Incheon into raptures.\nThere was nothing wrong with the goal, while Portugal fully deserved their two red cards. Jo\u00e3o Pinto had been shown a straight red after 27 minutes after leaping into Park two-footed in one of the least ambiguous sending-off offences imaginable, while Beto got a second yellow midway through the second half for scything down Young-pyo Lee out wide. Lu\u00eds Figo, one of the biggest names at the tournament, was going home, but it was hard to begrudge South Korea their victory. The real controversy came later: in securing top spot in the group, the co-hosts ended up on a collision course with Italy and, later, Spain.\n\nWhat followed were two upsets which sent European football into meltdown. Against Italy, South Korea benefitted from a series of contentious decisions from Byron Moreno, the referee, including Francesco Totti being harshly sent off for diving and Damiano Tommasi having a good goal ruled out for offside. The Italian media reacted magnanimously after the hosts won via golden goal: \u201cLADRI\u201d (\u201cTHIEVES\u201d) read the front page of Corriere dello Sport. When South Korea beat Spain on penalties in the quarter-finals after two goals for their opponents had been controversially disallowed, the conspiracy theories \u2013 with Fifa accused of favouring the host nation \u2013 took on a life of their own. \u201cI don\u2019t want to think that the referee went out to rob either team but the pictures speak for themselves,\u201d said Carles Puyol. \u201cIt\u2019s clear the referee was not in our favour.\u201d\nSouth Korea\u2019s wild run came to an end against Germany in the semi-finals, halted by a goal from Michael Ballack. It remains their strongest ever showing at a World Cup, with their progression to the last 16 in South Africa \u2013 where they lost 2-1 to Uruguay, with Su\u00e1rez scoring twice to set up that fateful quarter-final against Ghana \u2013 their only foray into the knockout rounds since. They can only hope to resurrect the spirit of 2002 against Portugal, with a few delicious VAR controversies thrown in for good measure. Technology may have come on over the last 20 years, but football\u2019s penchant for absurdity, acrimony and melodrama remains much the same. WM\nTalking points\nBelgium\u2019s problems ran deeper than Lukaku\u2019s sittersMisfiring No 9\u2019s make easy scapegoats and Romelu Lukaku has often found himself excessively lambasted for perceived square peg/round hole tendencies, even when the people designing the holes might warrant a tad more criticism. And so it was for Lukaku against Croatia. His introduction at half-time did give Belgium more menace but when your purpose is to score goals you need to put away at least one of the three notably gilt-edged chances that came Lukaku\u2019s way, even if two of them weren\u2019t quite as easy as they looked. If you\u2019re into that kind of thing, Lukaku\u2019s xG for that cameo alone (1.7) was higher than any other player\u2019s in the tournament. But Belgium aren\u2019t out because of one striker\u2019s profligacy, but for the entire team looking a disjointed, pallid mess all tournament. A rebuild is needed for an ageing side. TD\n\nMorocco have momentum and resilienceCanada have been huge fun at this tournament, and one of the few teams of whom you could say all of their group games were eminently watchable, but they\u2019ve had the weakest and most erratic back line, and they were given a lesson in defensive organisation by Morocco, who richly deserved to win Group F. The Atlas Lions should have been out of sight at half-time but, marshalled by Achraf Hakimi, had to show their defensive mettle in the second half when Canada sought to go out with a flourish. With Hakim Ziyech and Youssef En-Nesyri looking sprightly up front and one of the tournament\u2019s most numerous and vociferous fan followings, Morocco must fancy their chances of being the first African side in 12 years to reach the last eight. They would be worthy, and popular, quarter-finalists. TD\nBeyond the football\nChart-topping pop star Dua Lipa made waves before the World Cup by denying reports she would perform at the opening ceremony, explaining that she looked forward \u201cto visiting Qatar when it has fulfilled all the human rights pledges it made when it won the right to host the World Cup.\u201d Lipa eloquently expanded on that sentiment on Thursday: \u201cThe World Cup is a really unique opportunity to hold Qatar to account,\u201d she told Variety magazine. \u201cThey made pledges on human rights when they signed the deal for the World Cup that have not been satisfactorily met on migrant workers\u2019 rights, women\u2019s rights, LGBTQ rights and freedom of expression \u2014 what kind of message does it send if these pledges mean nothing?\u201d MBu\nGlobal media-watch\nBrazil\u2019s press feels confident the Sele\u00e7\u00e3o are on their way to a historic sixth title. They don\u2019t need psychic alpacas or octopi, as they have got Michael Bruno, 39, from Para\u00edba. The elementary school teacher claims to have predicted Spain, Germany and France as champions in 2010, 2014 and 2018, and now in Globo he says it is Brazil\u2019s turn. He pinpoints political factors as one of the key ingredients in his predictions. \u201cBrazil has been going through several turbulences in politics and in the economy, and nothing recovers morale more than a World Cup victory, a social phenomenon capable of reuniting and bringing together families and disaffections\u201d. He also says Portugal are going to win in 2026 if you want to get in early.\n\nIn Folha, they\u2019ve adopted a more scientific approach, with a mathematical model showing the trophy is more likely to be destined for CBF HQ in Rio de Janeiro than to any other single country. Scientists have run a prediction algorithm that takes into account the relative strengths of teams and the cost of the players making up the squads more than one million times, and Brazil end up champions 15% of the time \u2013 surpassing anybody else. Paulo Henrique Trentin, a professor at the mathematics department at Centro Universit\u00e1rio FEI, also cautions that models have some limitations \u2013 they can\u2019t predict crucial psychological factors or injuries. Sports publication Lance!, meanwhile, has focused on the path ahead, writing that fans in Brazil are already excited on social media at the prospect that if they get the point against Cameroon that they need to top the group on Friday, they will set up a potential World Cup \u201cSupercl\u00e1sico de las Am\u00e9ricas\u201d semi-final against Argentina. However, Lance! does concede that, to get there, \u201cArgentina will face modest Australia in the round of 16, [but] Brazil will face teams like Portugal, Ghana, Uruguay or South Korea.\u201d MBe\nThe internet reacts\nIt\u2019s not quite Melbourne-at-3am vibes but still an impressive show of support by Morocco fans at one of Qatar\u2019s \u2018fan festivals\u2019, as the Atlas Lions celebrate reaching the knockout stages of the World Cup for the first time since 1986.\n\nMeanwhile, in London, Morocco fans in London make themselves heard. A police officer is overheard saying: \u201cthey are so much more genial than the West Ham fans I normally have to deal with\u201d.\n\nToday\u2019s matches\nGhana v Uruguay (Group H, 3pm GMT, BBC2) The re-match of that contentious 2010 quarter-final starts with advantage Ghana. A win will put them through regardless of what happens elsewhere. A draw will be enough unless South Korea can conjure a win against Portugal. Up against them is Uruguay\u2019s ageing (and so far toothless) attack. No goals so far, but a win here \u2013 with a Portugal victory \u2013 could still see them progress. Villain of the piece Luis Su\u00e1rez says: \u201cWe are going to put our lives and soul into this match. We know them, we have beaten them before, we know how to beat them again.\u201d MBe\n\nSouth Korea v Portugal (Group H, 3pm GMT, BBC1) The emotional scenes at the end of South Korea\u2019s defeat to Ghana \u2013 coach Paulo Bento was sent off after the final whistle and will sit this one out in the stands \u2013 suggested the team knew the gig was up. They have to beat a supremely confident Portugal side well, and pray other results go their way. Portugal have motivation of their own. They have already qualified, but a point will manoeuvre them away from meeting Brazil next. \u201cIf we had to face each other, it would be a game between two great teams,\u201d Portugal coach Fernando Santos said. \u201cBut our wish, and Brazil\u2019s, is that we meet later on\u201d. MBe\nCameroon v Brazil (Group G, 7pm GMT, ITV1) Having already qualified, Tite is expected to field an entire reserve team for Brazil. The 39-year-old Dani Alves will become the oldest Brazilian to play at a World Cup, and a point will ensure Brazil win their group for the 11th straight finals. The Indomitable Lions\u2019 stunning comeback against Serbia leaves them needing to a win \u2013 a feat they managed once at the 2003 Confederations Cup \u2013 and hope results go their way. MBe\nSerbia v Switzerland (Group G, 7pm GMT, ITV4) This could be a corker and is probably the one to watch, as it has a grudge match element \u2013 Xherdan Shaqiri and Granit Xhaka picked up fines for pro-Kosovo celebrations when the sides met in the group stages at the last tournament \u2013 and it acts as effectively a knockout match. Assuming Cameroon won\u2019t get points against that second-string Brazil, Serbia can overhaul Switzerland and qualify with a win. The Swiss know a draw will almost certainly be enough to see them through. MBe\n\nPlayer to watch\nCameroon are potentially one win away from reaching the knockout stages for the first time since 1990. The thing is, they must beat some team called Brazil, hope Switzerland draw with Serbia and do it all with their second-choice goalkeeper. With experienced Inter keeper Andr\u00e9 Onana sensationally suspended by Cameroon\u2019s football federation \u201cfor disciplinary reasons\u201d, his replacement, Devis Epassy, conceded three goals in the thrilling draw with Serbia. Despite making a great stop to deny Aleksandar Mitrovic, the prospect of facing Vin\u00edcius Junior and co must be a daunting one for Epassy. Still, these are the storylines that create heroes. The French-born journeyman, currently with Saudi Arabian club Abha, has his chance to be one. MBu\nAnd finally \u2026\nIf you thought the end of Tunisia v France was confusing on Wednesday, spare a thought for TV producers around the globe. In what appears to have been a breach of the VAR protocol, referee Matthew Conger blew the final whistle without waiting for the signal that the check on Antoine Griezmann\u2019s seemingly last-minute equaliser was over. Consequently he was sent to the pitchside monitor to adjudge Griezmann offside \u2013 itself a messy decision \u2013 before blowing to restart the game for the final 40 seconds. None of which was seen by viewers in France, as broadcaster TF1 had cut to an advert break after Griezmann\u2019s shot crossed the line, believing the final whistle had sounded, prompting millions of viewers to switch off thinking France had salvaged a draw. TF1 issued an apology for its hasty exit on social media, and on the Mag show journalist Gr\u00e9goire Margotton was forced to explain the channel\u2019s error to the viewers that remained. MBe"

A virus had stretched an already depleted squad, with three players missing the semi-final against Morocco and at least two others affected in the subsequent days. All involved were passed fit for the match on Sunday but Deschamps highlighted a flatness that noticeably dogged his team for much of the game.\n\n\u201cThe whole squad has been facing a tricky situation for a while now,\u201d he said. \u201cMaybe that had a physical or psychological impact. But I had no concerns about the players who started the match: they were 100% fit.\n\u201cWe only had four days since the last match so there was some tiredness, perhaps. That\u2019s not an excuse, we just didn\u2019t have the same energy as in the previous match and that\u2019s why, for the first hour or so, we weren\u2019t in the match.\u201d\nDeschamps revealed he had spoken to the referee, Szymon Marciniak, after the game but would not elaborate on the reason. He distanced himself from any idea the officiating had helped Argentina to win while making clear that, in his view, they had been let off lightly earlier in the tournament.\n\u201cI need to be careful \u2013 you saw it as well as I did,\u201d he said of Marciniak\u2019s performance. \u201cIt could have been worse, it could have been better. Before this match Argentina had been a little bit lucky but I don\u2019t want to take anything away from them; they fully deserve the title. It is not because we suffered from any decisions that they came out victorious. I just discussed this with the referee after the game but don\u2019t want to go into details.\u201d\n\nThere is a considerable question around Deschamps\u2019s future. He has been in the job 10 years but his deal was due to expire after Qatar 2022.\n\u201cEven if we had won I wouldn\u2019t have replied [on that topic] tonight,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m very sad for my players and staff. I will have a meeting with the president [of the French Football Federation] at the beginning of next year and then you will find out.\u201d\nOn Mbapp\u00e9, who finished on the losing side despite being the first hat\u2011trick scorer in a men\u2019s final since 1966, he said: \u201cKylian has really left his mark on this final. Unfortunately he didn\u2019t end in the way he would have liked and that\u2019s why he was disappointed at the end of the match like all the players.\u201d"

We don\u2019t do well with dichotomies, and ambiguity is a bad word \u2013 it makes us worried.\u201d\nAt a packed-out English bar Dog &amp; Bone on Manhattan\u2019s Third Avenue many said the game, in which an England win would have guaranteed a place in the second round while a loss for the US would have made further progress in Qatar difficult, inspired mixed feelings \u2013 but only to a degree.\n\n\u201cEvery team always needs to win. You can\u2019t go into this with a mixed mindset because qualification is more assured,\u201d said Kevin Clarke, a Chelsea supporter from London, who said he had seen the domestic game becoming more popular in the US.\n\nAs in any match-up between two countries with closely intertwined histories, historical score-settling beneath expressions of competitive goodwill could also be inferred.\n\u201cI\u2019d like to see England lose more than I\u2019d like to America win,\u201d said Leicester City fan Jordan Fox, 19, before the 90 minutes was up. \u201cIt\u2019s the whole tea party, colonies thing. You guys never said sorry, so I\u2019d be pleased if it never \u2018comes home\u2019 again.\u201d\n\u201cIt felt like a loss after the 6-2 win [against Iran],\u201d said Scott Robertson, proprietor of the Dog &amp; Bone. Southgate\u2019s team, he added, didn\u2019t play to win, \u201che played not to lose\u201d. But at least it had been good for trade. \u201cAs a business owner, as long as we both go through, I\u2019m happy.\u201d\nA win for the US would have established that the game is called soccer, not football, said Kamila Bergaliyeva, a medical student from Kazakhstan. Bergaliyeva had not expected a USA victory.\n\u201cWe\u2019re here knowing we\u2019re probably going to lose. But if we win we want to be here for it,\u201d she said, adding that it was fun to see so many British fans dropping their reputation for emotional reserve. \u201cVery out of character,\u201d Bergaliyeva noted.\n\nNext door, at Fitzgerald\u2019s Pub, patrons were almost exclusively pro-US. As the scoreless half-time whiskey approached Dunbar said the outcome of the game matters more to the US \u201cbecause you guys have been doing it for so long \u2013 it\u2019s your national game\u201d.\nDunbar\u2019s father had played for the American team in the year the US last beat England in the World Cup. And that was in 1950. \u201cThe subculture of soccer in America is now permanent,\u201d he added. \u201cThe US played well, and we\u2019re a young team that\u2019s trying to establish itself for the future. We\u2019re looking four years ahead.\u201d\nA win now against Iran is essential for the USA to get through \u2013 a match that will come with its own historical and political complications."

                    "body": "In the town of Bondy in Paris\u2019s northern suburbs, where Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 grew up and trained, Ismail Gencel was preparing his bar and pizzeria for the crowds who would come to watch Saturday\u2019s France-England World Cup match. \u201cMbapp\u00e9 is our idol, our heritage, he\u2019s put Bondy on the map,\u201d said the 53-year-old, who once provided an upstairs room for Mbapp\u00e9\u2019s seventh birthday party \u2013 \u201ca very active, smiling child,\u201d he recalled, \u201cwho I now wish I\u2019d taken a photo with\u201d. \u201cThe football is bringing some cheer to France,\u201d Gencel added. \u201cWith Covid, the war in Ukraine and rising inflation, morale has been low. The World Cup is getting people out again, putting a smile on their face.\u201d Amid the cost of living crisis, wholesale prices of eggs and boxes for takeaway pizzas have more than doubled, and Gencel is reluctant to increase his own prices for customers, so margins are shrinking at an alarming rate. \u201cFootball is there to lift the mood,\u201d he said.  France, which won the World Cup four years ago, is in a football frenzy, hoping to become the first team to retain the title since Brazil in 1962. TV viewing figures for France\u2019s matches in Qatar have been higher than for the 2018 tournament. On top of this, Morocco\u2019s historic success in reaching the quarter-final this Saturday has enthralled the large numbers of French people of Moroccan heritage. If Morocco and France win their matches on Saturday, Paris is expecting an outpouring of celebration on the Champs-Elys\u00e9es. Mbapp\u00e9, hailed on the front page of France\u2019s top-selling sports paper, L\u2019\u00c9quipe, under the headline \u201cGod save our king\u201d, has cemented his status as a national treasure. He has also once again shone a spotlight on young talent in Bondy and the low-income, ethnically diverse suburbs north of Paris where young people have often been unfairly stigmatised and discriminated against. Mbapp\u00e9 was born in 1998, the year that France\u2019s World Cup-winning team starring Zinedine Zidane was mythologised as \u201cBlack-Blanc-Beur\u201d (Black-White-Arab) and presented by politicians as able to solve France\u2019s deep-seated identity issues through their triumph. Mbapp\u00e9 has spent the last four years since his first World Cup win at the age of 19 working to dismantle the stereotypes too often applied to Paris\u2019s banlieue, which is now a centre not just for football talent but for young entrepreneurship and business. Bondy has a population of about 53,000, extending either side of a motorway linking Paris to Charles de Gaulle airport. It is part of the d\u00e9partement of Seine-Saint-Denis, which is the poorest area in France, with the youngest population. Mbapp\u00e9 is not the only Bondy player in the World Cup squad \u2013 the defender William Saliba started at the local club, AS Bondy.  Mbapp\u00e9, who regularly returns to meet children in Bondy, has gone beyond funding youth charities, donating match winnings and creating a new pitch for the area. His father, Wilfried, who has Cameroonian roots, was a local football player and a respected coach and youth worker in Bondy. His mother, Fayza, of Algerian origin, was a professional handball player and youth worker, and the family are well known.  In a heartfelt open letter to the \u201ckids in Bondy\u201d and the \u201ckids in the banlieue\u201d in 2020, Mbapp\u00e9 wrote: \u201cOur neighbourhood is an incredible melting pot of different cultures \u2013 French, African, Asian, Arab, every part of the world. People from outside of France always talk about the banlieues in a bad light, but if you\u2019re not from here, you can\u2019t really understand what it\u2019s like. People talk about \u2018thugs\u2019 like they were invented here. But there are thugs everywhere in the world. There are people who are struggling everywhere in the world \u2026 When I was a kid I used to watch some of the toughest guys in the neighbourhood carry groceries for my grandmother. You never see those parts of our culture on the news. You only hear about the bad, never the good.\u201d Mbapp\u00e9 told Sports Illustrated last month that he had learned \u201cvalues\u201d and \u201crespect\u201d in the banlieue, saying that he once spotted Jos\u00e9 Mourinho in a group of people at an awards ceremony and went up and shook not only Mourinho\u2019s hand but everyone else\u2019s, saying it was a form of politeness he learned in Bondy. Aya, a Bondy teenager, walks to high school each day past a giant mural of Mbapp\u00e9 that dominates the side of a block of flats. She wants to study law and sees Mbapp\u00e9 as an inspiration. \u201cHe\u2019s shown that if you work hard, you don\u2019t have to come from a rich neighbourhood to succeed,\u201d she said. She would watch Saturday\u2019s match with her parents, who work as a security guard and a supermarket cashier, and she was looking forward to Mbapp\u00e9\u2019s promised visit to her school after the tournament.  Omar Bouakline, a youth worker and sports coach, said: \u201cThere is a great atmosphere here ahead of the France-England match, Mbapp\u00e9 is an example to so many children.\u201d Bouakline, 32, was coached by Mbapp\u00e9\u2019s father, as was his younger brother Mohamed Achi, who at 20 is one of Bondy\u2019s rising young stars, playing for Nantes. \u201cWilfried Mbapp\u00e9 was frankly one of the best youth workers I\u2019ve ever met, extremely human off the pitch. He taught us to work hard at school and respect others. Mbapp\u00e9\u2019s mother was the same. That\u2019s why their son is so well brought up.\u201d Jean-Pierre, 57, a groundskeeper who looks after the pitches at AS Bondy, Mbapp\u00e9\u2019s childhood club, said: \u201cThe match is all everyone is talking about.\u201d His one concern if France win the World Cup was politics. \u201cThe only dampener is that Emmanuel Macron could put himself at the centre of a win and that would spoil the party. There\u2019s a lot of tension right now, over salaries, strikes, protecting pensions and social rights that our grandparents fought for,\u201d he said. He felt that Macron \u2013 who could see his second World Cup win as president \u2013 might use the mood of festivity to push his plans to roll back the pension age. Macron, who accurately predicted the result and scorers of the France-Poland match, told a French radio station he \u201cdidn\u2019t really have a doubt\u201d that France would beat England, but has not yet forecast an exact score. At Harry\u2019s cafe, near Bondy\u2019s Mbapp\u00e9 mural, Assia, a staff member, was gearing up for Saturday. \u201cPeople always stop to take photos of the mural,\u201d she said. \u201cIt symbolises our town and it symbolises France.\u201d This article was produced in collaboration with Bondy Blog."

                    "body": "Back in 1984, when Sa\u00efd Aouita and Nawal El Moutawakel returned to Morocco having won gold at the Los Angeles Olympics, King Hassan II is said to have told both athletes they had put Morocco on the world map. The King, in fact, was so proud of their achievements that he recommended that all girls born in the remainder of that year be called \u201cNawal\u201d in homage of the then 22-year-old 400m hurdler who became a hero for every female athlete in Morocco and in the Arab region.\nI was only two years old at the time and do not remember the elation in the country and I do not have any clear memories of two years later when the football team made history by reaching the last 16 of the World Cup, the first African country to do so; just a blur of everyone being happy and cheerful in the middle of a summer night.\nMy first actual memory of Morocco at a World Cup was the disappointment of USA 94 when they lost all three group games, followed by the emotional rollercoaster of France four years later when not even a 3-0 victory against Scotland was enough to get out of the group. \n\nI was sad and jealous. I was envious of those who were able to remember clearly what had happened in Mexico in 1986 but also of what Cameroon had achieved in Italy in 1990 when they got to the quarter\u2011finals, even if I supported them and tried to imitate the famous Roger Milla dance every time I was scoring a goal while playing with my classmates or friends.\nIn 2004 the Atlas Lions reached the Africa Cup of Nations final but lost against the hosts Tunisia. \u201cI think what we always lacked was faith and self-confidence,\u201d says Khalid Fouhami, one of the key players of that Tunisian journey. \u201cValues of solidarity \u2013 all for one and one for all \u2013 are really important,\u201d the goalkeeper adds. \u201cAnd that precisely is what we had back in 2004.\u201d\nIn front of Fouhami on the right side of the defence, Morocco had a warrior called Walid Regragui. At the time he made the pledge to one day become the country\u2019s national team manager and take them to the World Cup. \n\nBut after that run to the final in 2004 there was \u2026 nothing. The Atlas Lions turned into toothless cats and it took them 18 years to find their lost glory. And how they have found a way to roar again. It was only three months ago that Regragui got the call to take over the team and fulfil his destiny. He has already become a legend together with the 26 players in the squad. Those men have brought a feeling of pride to the country, a feeling that was completely absent a decade or so ago.\n\u201cOf course, we feel proud,\u201d says Fouhami. \u201cBut above that, we feel uninhibited in the face of teams that are stronger than us.\u201d Fouhami, part of a side that came close to qualifying for the 2002 World Cup, is happy for his former teammate and friend. \u201cWalid\u2019s achievement gives credit to Moroccan managers and the work that has been done for a couple of years now.\u201d He also believes the Moroccan team\u2019s performance is opening a \u201cnew era\u201d for players and coaches around the world, where underdogs can dream of achieving big things.\n\nFor me the Moroccan journey in Qatar is renewing the feeling of pride among the people of my country. When the referee Facundo Tello blew the final whistle that ensured Morocco had beaten Portugal in the quarter-final there were eight players on the pitch who grew up in Morocco and learned their football in the country\u2019s academies and clubs.\nIt showed that the talk about there being a difference between those born and trained abroad and those not was simply not true. The players have all been as one and they have all been legendary. This also sends a strong message to everybody in the kingdom, that no matter what hurdles and difficulties you face, if you put your heart and soul in your dreams, they might just come true.\nAnd that message, of course, is far more important than any sporting achievement, including a World Cup semi\u2011final. When I first started as a journalist, a little over 10 years ago, my aim was to share my passion with a wider public to show just how much football, and sports in general, can transform the lives of not only the active stakeholders but literally everyone.\nThere were times I had to ask myself: \u201cIs that even true? Isn\u2019t this about my ego and my desire to thrive for success?\u201d And I had to be honest and admit that at times it was. At other times I was thinking that it was not worth it. But then an inspiring moment would come along and rejuvenate the faith that first drove me into this field of work. People would come up to me in the streets and encourage me and say what I had written made sense to them and we would share our stories and common memories around football.\n\nWhen Morocco beat Belgium in the group stage of this World Cup I knew my beliefs and the motivation behind my football passion was not only about performance. It was about life. Victory against Spain and then Portugal made it even more tangible. In life, you won\u2019t always be the best, nor will you be the one with many options. But you have to adapt to every situation and use whatever fair means and an awful lot of hard work and dedication to make it. The Atlas Lions have done just that and showed the world, themselves included, that faith and belief are the starting point to every journey and that, by working hard on it, you might just make your wildest dreams come true.\nMorocco is back on the world map again and, 38 years after Aouita and Moutawakel\u2019s achievements, 26 Lions and their managing team have became a source of inspiration for many generations to come, whatever happens in the next few days.\nAmine El Amri is a sports journalist working for Le Matin in Morocco"

                    "body": "The defender Neco Williams has revealed he played in Wales\u2019s stirring opening World Cup match against the US the day after his grandfather died. Williams, 21, said he managed to get though the 1-1 draw thanks to the support of his teammates and family. He paid tribute to his grandfather Kelvin Jones, himself a good footballer, for providing guidance and advice that had inspired him to become a professional player and represent his country. Posting on Instagram after the match \u2013 Wales\u2019s first appearance in the World Cup finals since 1958 \u2013 Williams said his mother breaking the news that Jones had died was \u201cthe toughest news I\u2019ve ever had to face\u201d. Williams continued: \u201cHe\u2019s been everywhere around the world to watch me play football from when I first started playing at Liverpool at six years old. He\u2019d never tell me if I had a good game because he always said I have to get better and better each day and that\u2019s why I am where I am now. \u201cSo I dedicate this game all to him because I know he\u2019s up there watching down on me very proudly. For everyone please cherish [what] you have with loved ones because you never know when it can get taken away from you.\u201d On Twitter he added: \u201cTo go from crying all day to start in a World Cup game was extremely tough but I got through it from the support of my team mates and family.\u201d  Like all his teammates Williams belted out the Welsh national anthem at the start of the game, a rousing moment that has won praise around the world. After the game Williams, who now plays for Nottingham Forest, looked red-eyed. He pointed to the sky and said: \u201cThat was for you, grandad.\u201d He was comforted by several of his teammates. Wales drew thanks to a Gareth Bale penalty, a result that was celebrated across the country and gives Wales a good platform from which to progress to the knockout stage. Williams is from the village of Cefn Mawr, near Wrexham in north Wales. In an open letter to him published in the Athletic last year his family suggested he got his talent from his grandfather, whose own promising career was cut short by injuries. They wrote: \u201cEveryone always talks about what an amazing footballer your grandad was and how he could have made it to the top if it wasn\u2019t for breaking his ankle twice. He is so proud of you for living a dream that was taken from him. \u201cDo you remember he used to always tell you \u2026 to make sure you were practising on your left foot as well as your right?\u201d"

                    "body": "\u201cI need a good jacuzzi,\u201d Carlos Queiroz said, breaking into a smile as he reflected on one of the more eccentric Iran celebrations inside this thudding stadium.\nWhen the final whistle sounded in the 102nd minute, the Iran striker Sardar Azmoun grabbed Queiroz by the throat in unbridled joy before quickly recalibrating, instead pinching his manager\u2019s cheeks. Then in the unfettered aftermath he attempted to take a piggyback on the Portuguese coach. By this point Azmoun, wearing a substitute\u2019s bib having been replaced, had long been lost in the delirium of two second-half stoppage-time goals propelling his country to a warranted and yet unfathomably late win over Wales.\nThis was not how Wales envisaged a first World Cup since 1958 mapping out. For so long it seemed they would somehow avoid losing a match that had become the epitome of living dangerously well before Wayne Hennessey was sent off for inadvertently poleaxing Mehdi Taremi on 86 minutes, a moment that had shades of Harald Schumacher\u2019s wild clotheslining of Patrick Battiston at the 1982 World Cup in Spain.\nAli Gholizadeh had a first-half goal disallowed for offside and in the second half Azmoun and Gholizadeh rattled opposite posts within seconds of one another. The fourth official, Maguette Ndiaye, indicated nine minutes of stoppage time and in the penultimate minute Wales eventually cracked.\n\nThe substitute Roozbeh Cheshmi roamed forward and curled a powerful right-foot shot into the far corner from the edge of the box and Ramin Rezaeian put the gloss on a victory three minutes later. Defeat all but kills Wales\u2019s hopes of progressing to the last 16.\nAs Iran\u2019s players rejoiced, Gareth Bale stood forlorn in an empty half vacated by Queiroz\u2019s players, Kieffer Moore kicked at his heels and the substitute Brennan Johnson crouched on his haunches. The restart was a formality. Iran soon set off on a victory lap as Wales\u2019s players lay floored. Wales have waited 64 years for this World Cup and although it pained Rob Page to admit the Red Wall have had little to shout about in Qatar their fans offered Iran\u2019s players a warm reception as they went full circle. \u201cI love this game when things are this way,\u201d Queiroz said.\n\nThis was always going to be a fraught occasion and emotions were amplified before kick-off when Iran\u2019s players broke their silence by singing their national anthem. Taremi had said that none of the squad were under pressure to sing despite the threat of reprisals at home but the anguish on the faces of some players as they mumbled the words half-heartedly spoke volumes. In the stands, Iran\u2019s boisterous support made clear their disdain for their government, jeering their own players. Tears streamed down one woman\u2019s cheeks and a man carrying an Iran flag appeared inconsolable.\nQueiroz\u2019s warning that Iran\u2019s World Cup would begin in earnest against Wales after a humiliating start against England no longer looks quite such a sanguine take and, when Cheshmi struck, Wales could not argue it had not been coming. They had been clinging on and Bale\u2019s hands were clasped behind his back in the box, frantically trying to prevent the possibility of giving away a penalty as Iran peppered the Wales goal after Hennessey\u2019s dismissal. Iran made five changes from Monday and were unrecognisable; Wales painfully disjointed.\n\nWales avoided going a goal down when Gholizadeh\u2019s first-half goal was ruled offside but Wales wilted in the heat of battle. They were overrun in midfield and failed to stop the bleeding. Time and again Ethan Ampadu was exposed at the base of midfield, with Aaron Ramsey and Harry Wilson offering little support. Moore forced Hossein Hosseini into an instinctive save with a dozen minutes on the clock after meeting Connor Roberts\u2019 perfect cross but, that aside, Wales\u2019s attacks were forgettable. Ben Davies drew gasps after driving a shot over via the hand of Hosseini, who was deputising for Alireza Beiranvand after the No 1 was ruled out under Fifa concussion protocols.\nThings went from bad to worse when Hennessey rushed out to confront Taremi as the forward latched on to an incisive through ball and left him in a heap. The referee, Mario Escobar, initially handed Hennessey a yellow card but a VAR review upgraded the punishment to a red. Moments earlier Hennessey had gone low to his right to superbly deny Saeid Ezatolahi but the 35-year-old will remember this game for the wrong reasons. He became only the third goalkeeper to be sent off at a World Cup. Tony Roberts, the Wales goalkeeper coach, booted a water bottle in frustration as Escobar delved into his back pocket.\nJoe Allen entered as a late substitute for his first World Cup appearance but his attempt to block Cheshmi\u2019s shot was in vain after his poor clearance as the substitute\u2019s right-foot shot, via the substitute goalkeeper Danny Ward\u2019s fingertips, nestled in the bottom corner. On the touchline Page, arms folded, was unmoved.\nIran\u2019s bench emptied on to the pitch \u2013 a mass outpouring of emotion \u2013 and a repeat of those scenes soon followed. Allen failed to trap the ball and Iran shifted the ball infield with purpose, presenting Rezaeian with the chance to beat Ward. Davies, perhaps Wales\u2019s best performer, made a desperate attempt to intervene but Rezaeian displayed great composure to lift the ball over Ward. It may take some time for Wales to get back up again."

                    "body": "\u201cI was never scared to look for challenges,\u201d Thilo Kehrer says as he thinks about leaving Kylian Mbapp\u00e9, Lionel Messi and Neymar behind for a fight for Premier League survival. The defender is in a thoughtful but confident mood. He has not had an easy time since moving to England last summer and yet, as he prepares to face Tottenham this afternoon, there is no sign the Germany international regrets swapping dominance at Paris Saint\u2011Germain for a season of unease at West Ham.  \u201cI was always open to things that would challenge me in a way that might risk struggling,\u201d Kehrer says. \u201cBut I always knew that overcoming this would make me better as a player and grow as a person. It has been the absolute right step. The Premier League is different to Ligue 1 or the Bundesliga. It was exciting to watch the league. It\u2019s even more exciting to play in it.\u201d The belief is good to hear because things have not gone to plan for Kehrer so far. He conceded a penalty on his Premier League debut, scored an unfortunate own goal when West Ham drew with Spurs in August and has been beaten too easily on a few occasions. He could be forgiven for wondering if he was made for English football. Yet Kehrer is calm. He started when PSG lost the Champions League final to Bayern Munich in 2020; perhaps he just needs time to show why West Ham bought him. \u201cWhen I came in I had a long pre\u2011season,\u201d Kehrer says. \u201cI was thrown straight in and I needed a feel for the team first. The fastest way you get that is by playing. There is a possibility of things not going the way you want and we had a difficult start. We had the performances, but couldn\u2019t get the results. \u201cWe had players coming into a system which had worked for two years, changing the balance of the team. Sometimes it takes a bit of time for players to adapt to each other and in the last few weeks we are stabilising. The cogs are becoming more fluid. You never know how long it will take players to connect: sometimes instantly, sometimes a little bit longer.\u201d  West Ham have slipped into a relegation battle but their form has picked up. David Moyes has switched to a back three and Kehrer, who can play centrally or as a full-back, had a good game in last weekend\u2019s 1-1 draw with Chelsea. The 26-year-old\u2019s mentality is strong. He talks about opening a foundation in Burundi, his mother\u2019s homeland, and is forthright when it comes to discussing whether there was too much pressure on footballers to protest against Qatar\u2019s human rights record at the World Cup. Kehrer has perspective. His mother is a nurse. His father, who is German, worked as a carpenter for NGOs in Africa. The work was valuable. Kehrer\u2019s parents lived in Burundi and Rwanda. It was the 90s and they saw civil war in both countries. \u201cThey had to be evacuated multiple times to neighbouring countries,\u201d Kehrer says. \u201cIf not, they would not have survived.\u201d Kehrer was three when his family moved to Germany but he feels a connection with Burundi. \u201cThis tragedy of almost 30 years ago is still affecting the country,\u201d he says. \u201cRwanda a little less because there has been more political stability after the war. Burundi is a few years behind. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to give back with the foundation. I feel very privileged in the position I am in today and in the opportunities I had in my youth. Going to school, being able to do sports like football, basketball, track and field \u2013 in Burundi there are so many young kids who are as talented or even more talented than I was at that age, but they don\u2019t have the same opportunities.\u201d Kehrer has his feet on the ground. He came through Schalke\u2019s vaunted academy and speaks fondly of the club\u2019s under-19s coach, Norbert Elgert, who helped launch the careers of Mesut \u00d6zil, Julian Draxler and Leroy San\u00e9. \u201cYou get taught fundamental things that are important in football but in life as well,\u201d Kehrer says. \u201cIt\u2019s about respect. It is about equality. It is about discipline. It\u2019s about hard work. It\u2019s about humbleness. I think that\u2019s why so many players have made it into professional football from that academy.\u201d It was different at PSG, who signed Kehrer in 2018. He joined one of the best teams in the world and would end up in the same dressing room as Messi, Mbapp\u00e9 and Neymar. \u201cThe quality was huge, immense,\u201d he says. \u201cYou have to be on the spot every day.\u201d Could Kehrer live with Mbapp\u00e9\u2019s pace? \u201cI don\u2019t think anyone can keep up with Mbapp\u00e9,\u201d he says. \u201cBut by being smart and having help from the team, you can stop him.\u201d  Kehrer thought his understanding of the game grew when Thomas Tuchel managed PSG. Tuchel\u2019s coaching helped him become a Germany international. Hansi Flick has given him opportunities and took him to Qatar for the World Cup but Germany\u2019s campaign ended in failure. Kehrer started one game \u2013 the 1-1 draw with Spain \u2013 and Germany suffered their second consecutive group stage exit. \u201cA few days after going out of the tournament we went to analyse the things that didn\u2019t go right,\u201d Kehrer says. \u201cWe said we need to draw a line and focus on what\u2019s coming. We\u2019ve got the Euros in Germany next year. There are things we need to do better. Things that can\u2019t happen again.\u201d Kehrer considers the noise before Germany lost their opening game to Japan. The focus was on Fifa barring captains from European teams from supporting LGBTQ+ rights by wearing the \u201cOneLove\u201d rainbow armband. Qatar\u2019s human rights record was under the spotlight and Germany\u2019s players responded to Fifa\u2019s edict by covering their mouths when they were photographed before kick-off against Japan. Inevitably some people argued that Germany lost because they were too focused on political issues. \u201cIt would be too easy to put it on that,\u201d Kehrer says. \u201cBut you also can\u2019t deny that some of the things around the game affected the preparation. I\u2019m not saying that in the game things went wrong because of that. But I don\u2019t think they helped. We analysed all of that and it\u2019s definitely something to look out for in the future. \u201cOver the last few years as a national team we are standing for human rights. I just think during the World Cup there are some things as players we are happy to do and we think are our responsibility. But there were also things being put on players. \u201c[J\u00fcrgen] Klopp said it \u2013 the players should mainly focus on competing in this tournament. Having a World Cup every four years, nobody knows how many times you\u2019re going to get there. It can be discussed. But there was maybe too much pressure on players.\u201d Kehrer tries to find the right balance. He wants to help the less fortunate but he cares about his football. He needs to stop Harry Kane on Sunday afternoon. \u201cHe is a very intelligent striker,\u201d Kehrer says. \u201cHe is like [Karim] Benzema. You need to be so awake against him.\u201d"

                    "body": "Gary Lineker is no longer right. Football is no longer a game in which Germany win in the end. In Qatar, the big nations have succeeded so far. Only not us; as in the two previous major tournaments, Germany were eliminated early.\nA pattern can be discerned in the failures of the past four or five years. Germany have lost defensive stability \u2013 the team cannot keep anyone away from their goal. Every opponent creates chances, even Costa Rica and (in the only preparation match) Oman. Germany\u2019s game always suffers a break.\nIn all three group matches Germany showed passion, commitment and aggression. The opponents sensed there were players with quality. But there was a lack of strategy and order; it was never clear who would take on which role. Hansi Flick\u2019s team were not not well organised in Qatar.\n\nAs a counter-example let\u2019s take Argentina, who also lost to an outsider. Saudi Arabia scored twice and three Argentina \u201cgoals\u201d could be recognised as offside only with new technology. Luck and bad luck are part of the game. But even in that defeat, you could see that Lionel Scaloni\u2019s team were dominant because they were well organised. They then locked Mexico and Poland in their half at some point to score goals. The superior boxer sets up the knockout.\nGermany were not able to do that. They failed to control the game. To control a game you have to develop play from the defence and from the centre. That is a law of football. These positions \u2013 in the jargon 4, 5, 6, 8 and 10 \u2013 must complement each other, pay attention to each other, develop a blind understanding.\nStability comes from continuity. For a long time, however, it was not clear who would defend in the centre for Germany. The midfield didn\u2019t find itself, although the right players were available. I was sure that Joshua Kimmich, Leon Goretzka and Ilkay G\u00fcndogan would complement each other to form a strong unit if left together for three or four games. That was not the case.\nAnother problem: it wasn\u2019t clear which of our fast wing-backs should contribute to the game and how, and nor was an approach apparent in our offensive play. Germany have four attackers with very good skills in Serge Gnabry, Jamal Musiala, Kai Havertz and Leroy San\u00e9, as well as the alternatives Thomas M\u00fcller and Niclas F\u00fcllkrug. I would have settled on that much earlier.\n\nFootball is all about the details. For attacking that means, for example: how do I penetrate the box without giving up everything? How do I reduce the danger of a counterattack if I lose the ball while dribbling? A team can only solve risk management problems together, in coordination with each other. Argentina are strong at it. Germany lack the structure to do this or to play a game that suffocates the opponent, which inevitably results in conceding goals.\nIt will be a challenging task to form a team with a view to the European Championship at home in a year and a half. Germany must reinvent themselves so that Lineker is right again.\nEvery country has its difficulties in this tournament, even the favourites and former world champions. France have convinced me the most. Their team are complete: they have physicality, structure and technique. The defence is stable, the midfield thinks defensively. The attack around the outstanding Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 has power and creativity. But because the team love to demonstrate their superiority, I wonder what will happen when things don\u2019t go well. Then it becomes difficult to flip the switch. Mbapp\u00e9 still has to prove that he has the maturity to always do the right thing at the right moment.\n\nSpain are celebrating their culture of pass-dominated possession in Qatar. It\u2019s always nice to watch and smaller nations such as Costa Rica hardly ever get the ball against Spain. Sometimes, though, Spain overdo it. They even pass across the penalty area, even the goalkeeper, although he is always the weakest footballer in a team. Then the idea becomes an ideology. This makes Spain particularly vulnerable because they no longer have Carles Puyol, Sergio Ramos, Xavi and Andr\u00e9s Iniesta. They also don\u2019t defend standard situations well.\nBrazil have an excellent individual lineup, in the forwards, in defence, in goal. The team are no longer as dependent on Neymar. But it has been a long time since they played against a top European team. You don\u2019t know how they will react to the opposition and whether the stars will bring all their qualities to the pitch. Brazil are the great unpredictable after Germany\u2019s exit.\nEngland are a physically strong team with the toughness of the Premier League and a lot of attacking options. This accumulation of quality can be an advantage. But guiding them into a powerful team is not easy. Phil Foden started only the third game and everyone immediately saw why he should always do so. Only when the best \u2013 besides Foden, that\u2019s Harry Kane \u2013 are regularly involved does a pattern emerge in the team. Another England concern: the defensive centre is struggling to get the ball into the other half quickly. If the opponent stands deep, time is lost in the development of the game.\nHow a team come to success is well illustrated by Croatia. They are still built around the 37-year-old Luka Modric. Always available, he is impressively good at creating balance with strategic passes, taking pressure off his team and transferring it to the opponents. Josko Gvardiol is also one of the best defenders of the tournament. Croatia again look convincing but the nation is limited in its player selection due to its size.\nI am curious to see how all the teams that have reached the last 16 deal with their shortcomings. That\u2019s what makes a World Cup so interesting and exciting.\nPhilipp Lahm\u2019s column was produced in partnership with Oliver Fritsch at Zeit Online, the German online magazine, and is being published in several European countries"

That decision was taken out of my hands today. I turned up to the stadium with the armband that I wore and I was told I had to wear that [the official Fifa one]. It\u2019s out of our control as players. I\u2019m sure the FA and Fifa will continue those discussions but most importantly today we focused on the game and got a great result.\u201d\nKane said England, who took the knee before facing Iran, will continue to do their best to speak out against injustice. \u201cYou\u2019ve seen over the last five years we\u2019ve made a stand as a squad and we\u2019ll continue to do that as much as we can. We took the knee today as well but sometimes these decisions aren\u2019t up to us and that\u2019s the bottom line.\u201d\nSouthgate refused to condemn Fifa\u2019s behaviour and said teams should be allowed to focus on their performances. \u201cThe armband, it\u2019s not something myself or the players have been involved in over the last 24 hours,\u201d England\u2019s head coach said.\n\u201cThese discussions have been ongoing between several European nations and Fifa.\n\u201cI actually do understand Fifa\u2019s situation, in that you can set a precedent and then it\u2019s very difficult where you draw the line. So I think in an ideal world that would have been a much clearer situation earlier but it\u2019s not something that\u2019s been a distraction.\n\n\u201cWe said yesterday we need to focus on the football. People know this group of players are taking the knee because it\u2019s something we feel we can make a difference with. There are some things I\u2019m not sure we are going to be able to make a difference with and therefore we should channel our energies in the right direction.\n\u201cI think every coach now deserves the right to be able to focus on the football. We understand there are issues that people want us to speak about. We\u2019ve done that for the last 12 months. But this is a World Cup. We won\u2019t refuse to answer any questions. But the predominant part of our energy has to be on preparing the team. There are other people at our federation who have to deal with those issues because it\u2019s not the responsibility of the players. They didn\u2019t decide where we are.\u201d, while Iranian fans booed it in response to the brutal actions of their country\u2019s regime.

                    "body": "On 57 minutes Marcus Rashford showed the finest way to return from a World Cup. The No 10 collected inside Manchester United\u2019s half and, after turning the afterburners on, propelled himself at Jordan Beyer along the right. The centre-back kept backpedalling and Rashford kept coming until slick footwork bedazzled the Burnley man and in a flash, Bailey Peacock-Farrell was beaten by a laser of a finish, on the angle, from inside the area.\nFor Rashford, a star turn for England at Qatar 2022 with three goals, this was a ninth United goal this season \u2013 perhaps his finest for the club \u2013 and ensured Erik ten Hag\u2019s side are in the quarter-finals. Against Vincent Kompany\u2019s Championship leaders they managed to be dominant and undercooked, the latter characteristic no surprise given their five-week layoff.\n\nOf Rashford\u2019s display, the manager said: \u201cHe was great, a constant threat playing on the backline and was dangerous with his dribbling and movement. He runs so much. Eventually you get the benefit.\u201dThe 25-year-old offered his own take: \u201cThere is space in front of you and you\u2019re almost waiting for the right time to get a pass off but the gap opened and thankfully it went in.\u201dBurnley\u2019s manager had declared his men content to run for the ball when out of possession yet this was what they initially made United do as one break illustrated, with Ashley Barnes flicking a Johann Gudmundsson cross wide. When Bruno Fernandes slipped in Alejandro Garnacho the youngster failed to beat an advancing Peacock-Farrell but United were coming to life. Further pressure ensued via a corner volleyed into a crowd of players by the lurking Rashford.After United\u2019s last action \u2013 a 2-1 league win at Fulham \u2013 and before a reduced 62,000 capacity due to the ambulance strikes, Ten Hag had sent out five World Cup returnees in Christian Eriksen, Casemiro, Rashford, Tyrell Malacia and Fernandes, though illness ruled out Harry Maguire, who remains a doubt for Tuesday\u2019s league visit of Nottingham Forest.\n\nPerhaps rust was why Garnacho\u2019s touch was clumsy when Anthony Martial poked the ball beyond Burnley\u2019s defence and the winger hit it too far ahead of him as he drove towards Peacock-Farrell. United searched for their best rhythm and it was scintillating when found.Fernandes received in a central area and hooked the ball towards Aaron Wan-Bissaka whose leap was followed by the sweetest of volleyed crosses from the right, which was smashed home by Eriksen. Ten Hag said: \u201cThe players are hungry after the World Cup break and it was great to see this team goal.\u201dUnited had a swagger and were in firm ball-hogging mode, sapping the energy of those in blue as they had to keep chasing them. But, now, came a mini-fightback. One counterattack had Barnes feeding Manuel Benson but he could only find Martin Dubravka\u2019s side-netting. The same player did better with an arrowed effort that had the Slovakian flying left to save and when, seconds later, Benson crossed, the keeper missed a regulation punch, the ball ricocheted off Rashford and, as it veered towards goal, Casemiro scrambled clear.\n\nThis, too, was what the hapless Dubravka had to do when miscontrolling the Brazilian\u2019s back pass: he managed to stop the ball rolling in but these were not confident contributions. United, perhaps deeming it wiser to operate at the other end, soon had Martial twisting and shooting, the No 9 drawing an acrobatic stop from Peacock-Farrell.The tie was still in the balance and so when Rashford found Scott McTominay and his attempt missed, here was a chance gone to all but kill off Kompany\u2019s men. Benson then should have equalised after McTominay passed straight to him but he blazed wide.Now came Rashford\u2019s superb solo goal yet still Burnley refused to fold. Barnes was teed up by Gudmunsson but with Dubravka\u2019s goal begging the striker missed badly \u2013 to the delight of the home faithful. Antony, on as a replacement, went close to emulating Rashford when skating through but after cutting inside to his favoured left foot he steered straight at Peacock-Farrell.Towards the end Brandon Williams, who has the feisty attitude desired by Ten Hag, entered for a first appearance for United since May 2021, a loan spell at Norwich last season and injury in this one the reasons for his long break.The Dutchman will rate this competition as a definite route to breaking the club\u2019s trophy drought that stretches back to 2017 so progress here was a classic case of the job well done."

By contrast, last year was dominated by Olympic-themed choices after Tokyo hosted the summer Games in the middle of the Covid-19 pandemic.  \u201cThe invasion of Ukraine by Russia, the shooting of former prime minister Abe, and the rapid yen depreciation and inflation faced in daily life have caused anxiety for many people,\u201d the foundation said in a statement. Abe, Japan\u2019s longest-serving prime minister, was shot dead while making an election campaign speech in July, allegedly by a man who resented his connections to the Unification church. Live TV broadcasts of this week\u2019s announcement showed Seihan Mori, head priest at Kiyomizu temple in Kyoto, write the character on a large piece of washi paper with an ink-soaked calligraphy brush. \u201cI hope the \u2018war\u2019 ends next year and people can live in peace,\u201d Mori said. The character, which is pronounced as sen in words such as senso (war) and ikusa (battle) when it appears on its own, was the kanji of choice in 10,804 of the 223,768 entries. While many people cited Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, others said their choice had been influenced by North Korean missile launches and the daily struggle posed by rising food prices. Some said they had been moved to select the kanji by sporting drama, including the Winter Olympics in Beijing, Japanese professional baseball and the World Cup in Qatar. \u201cI was surprised, frustrated, angry and sad by the war in Ukraine. I am also angry at myself for not being able to do anything about it,\u201d said one voter who picked the character. This year\u2019s poll, now in its 28th year, was not entirely gloomy, however. The kanji for contentment came second, followed by the character for enjoyment. But the inclusion, in fourth and fifth place, of the ideograms for expensive and strife suggested that many will be glad to see the back of 2022. The kanji for kin, meaning gold or money, won last year\u2019s vote after Japan won a record 27 gold medals at the Tokyo Games. The 2020 winner was mitsu, meaning dense, crowded and close: three situations people in Japan were urged to avoid to prevent the spread of Covid-19. The sen character last topped the poll in 2001, the year of the 9/11 attacks. With Agence France-Presse"

                    "body": "Every four years, the district of Cai\u00e7ara in Belo Horizonte transforms itself. Rows of Brazilian flags dance from lamp-posts and telephone poles; the roads and pavements are slathered in blue, green and yellow paint by an army of volunteers.\nIt is a tradition that goes back to the 1994 World Cup, and until now has taken place entirely without objection. This time, however, the local community felt it necessary to issue a caveat. And so, in among the bunting and the balloons, a banner reads: \u201cN\u00c3O \u00c9 POL\u00cdTICA, \u00c9 COPA.\u201d It\u2019s not politics, it\u2019s the cup.\nAs J\u00falio C\u00e9sar Silva Freitas, one of the organisers of the display, explained to the local news website BHAZ: \u201cWhen we started painting we suffered a lot, on both sides. Some passed by shouting: \u2018Yeah, Bolsonaro!\u2019 Others said it was absurd. We tried to explain; some accepted it, others didn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nWelcome to the political minefield that is Brazilian football in 2022. And of course, the two have never really been separate. From the moment the game began to catch hold in South America, Brazil\u2019s rulers saw football as an indispensable lever of power, a means not simply of harnessing popular sentiment but articulating their own particular vision of nationhood.\nA century ago, the president Epit\u00e1cio Pessoa sought to ban black players from the national team. The 1970 World Cup win was enthusiastically hijacked by the military government for propaganda purposes. More recently, the rise of the populist Jair Bolsonaro has reanimated the debate over the meaning of Brazil\u2019s national symbols, including the treasured yellow national team shirt.\nThe president of Brazil since 2018 but the loser in last month\u2019s general election, Bolsonaro and his supporters would often wear the shirt at rallies, an attempt to appropriate it as an emblem of their patriotic far-right movement. To an extent it worked: many progressive Brazilians now spurn the yellow shirt because of its political connotations, or choose the blue change strip instead.\n\nBolsonaro\u2019s successor-elect, the left-wing Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, has instead tried to detoxify the shirt, declaring he would wear it during the World Cup. \u201cThe green and yellow is not a candidate, it\u2019s not a party,\u201d he said. \u201cGreen and yellow are the colours for 213 million inhabitants who love this country.\u201d\nAnd really this is a discussion that goes much deeper than one breathable garment. Under Bolsonaro, Brazil has become more divided and politicised than at any point in its democratic era. The nebulous hope is that a sixth World Cup victory \u2013 O Hexa \u2013 might go some way towards healing some of those rifts, rallying a hurt nation around a single common cause, perhaps even reclaiming the national shirt from the reactionaries and the racists. The harsh reality, of course, is that these days football is simply another arena of the political battlefield, however much those in the setup would prefer it otherwise.\nThe man with the unenviable task of negotiating this fractured inheritance is Tite, who in his six years as Brazil coach has striven to avoid engaging with politics, with only partial success. Many leftists spy a certain veiled allyship in his measured pronouncements on \u201csocial responsibility\u201d and \u201cgreater equality\u201d and warnings against the politicisation of the national team.\n\nThree years ago, when Brazil won the Copa Am\u00e9rica on home soil, Tite\u2019s brusque and cursory acknowledgment of Bolsonaro during the victory ceremony was interpreted as its own small act of resistance. Unlike previous coaches, he has pledged not to visit the president in Bras\u00edlia if he wins the World Cup, breaking a tradition that stretches back to their first victory in 1958. Still, he has understandably refused to expand on his own political allegiances. \u201cI\u2019m not going to carry this battle,\u201d he said in Folha de S\u00e3o Paulo in October. \u201cI will vote secretly and I have my ideas very clear.\u201d\nThe problem is not all of his players feel the same way. One of Bolsonaro\u2019s most fervent supporters during the election campaign was Neymar, who as well as offering his endorsement promised to dedicate his first World Cup goal to the incumbent president. The veteran defenders Thiago Silva and Dani Alves have also offered their backing to Bolsonaro in the past, along with the former players Rom\u00e1rio, Ronaldinho and Rivaldo. Meanwhile, the Tottenham winger Richarlison has been vocal on a number of social justice causes in recent months, although he has thus far refrained from aligning with any particular candidate.\n\nThe rich irony is that on talent and form, this Brazil team goes to Qatar asare one of the favourites. Since the last World Cup they have lost three out of 50 matches, all of them by a single goal. Their forward line \u2013 which boasts not only Richarlison and Neymar but Vin\u00edcius J\u00fanior, Rodrygo, Antony, Gabriel Jesus, Gabriel Martinelli, Pedro and Raphinha \u2013 would be the envy of any team in the world. And yet the question remains: can a side this fundamentally divided ever truly unite?\nTite has already announced that he will step down as coach after the tournament, and has scotched rumours of a ban on discussing politics within the camp. \u201cIt does not exist,\u201d he said. \u201cOr else we have democracy only when you agree with me. Democratically, we must respect each other\u2019s positions.\u201d\nYet for a nation feeling exhausted, anxious and bruised by years of political bickering, this World Cup represents perhaps the last realistic attempt at expressing a common vision of what it means to be Brazilian. In victory, the vision of a single unified Brazil may just hold. Defeat, on the other hand, risks opening up old wounds, old divisions, old uncertainties."

                    "body": "Battle for England World Cup places In the January transfer window, several players have engineered moves in search of regular playing time before the World Cup in July. Beth England\u2019s decision to leave Chelsea for Tottenham, for a record fee between two WSL clubs, will not have been made lightly, but with her game time squeezed at Chelsea and competition for places up front in Sarina Wiegman\u2019s England squad for the World Cup increasing, the move makes sense. England\u2019s move was followed by that of her international teammate Jordan Nobbs, whose career has been blighted by injury to the extent that she has played only one match at a major tournament for England, at the World Cup in 2015. At 30, her move to Aston Villa after 12 years at Arsenal is likely one more roll of the dice. Lucy Staniforth\u2019s switch from Manchester United to Villa is another example of the Villa manager Carla Ward\u2019s astute plan to capitalise on the stacked squads of the top WSL sides. The season resumes on Saturday lunchtime with Villa\u2019s home game against Spurs.  Four into three won\u2019t go Chelsea, Arsenal, Manchester United and Manchester City are in the hunt for three spots in the Champions League. Arsenal host Chelsea on Sunday in a game that will probably see the winner labelled title favourites, but the season is far from over. Arsenal have been the busiest of the four teams in the transfer window, having lost Vivianne Miedema and Beth Mead to ACL injuries, and made the Canada goalkeeper Sabrina D\u2019Angelo their latest signing on Friday, but Jonas Eidevall\u2019s side have to play the three teams around them five times in the second half of the WSL campaign while competing in three cup competitions. Chelsea and City play four games each against the other top-four sides. The dark horse to win a trophy \u2013 a cup or even the league \u2013 could be United. Marc Skinner\u2019s side host City and Arsenal and face a tricky trip to Chelsea but they took four points from the three reverse fixtures and don\u2019t have Champions League games stretching the squad like Arsenal and Chelsea. Kirk eyes miracle recovery At the bottom things are far less tight. Leicester\u2019s manager, Willie Kirk, who replaced Lydia Bedford in November, has the unenviable or nigh-on impossible job of saving the pointless Foxes from relegation. Leicester have scored two league goals and conceded 25 but put an 8-0 defeat by Chelsea behind them to beat Sunderland 5-0 before the winter break in the League Cup group stage. The Midlands side are seven points below Brighton and Reading, the former having played a game fewer and the latter a game more. Why is a fairly nonexistent relegation battle worth keeping an eye on? Because if Kirk lifts Leicester off bottom it will be one of the most remarkable achievements in the league\u2019s history.  Will all the managers survive? We saw two managerial changes in the first half of the campaign, with Hope Powell leaving Brighton after a disappointing start and Bedford ditched, but could there be more? The managerial merry-go-round in women\u2019s football is a relatively new phenomenon; more money in the game means results matter more and so the pressure is greater. More change is unlikely but if Tottenham do not shift out of their goalscoring slump after signing England then Rehanne Skinner could find herself under the microscope. Spurs have injuries aplenty, with Ria Percival, Kyah Simon, Ellie Brazil and Kit Graham out with ACL ruptures, which may ease the pressure a little, but they have gone into the January window armed with that knowledge. Is England\u2019s arrival and the recall of Esther Morgan enough or will we see more action? Young players impressing A number of young players made a mark before the break. Most notably, Chelsea\u2019s Lauren James has impressed when unleashed more regularly by Emma Hayes. The forward has often been touted as one of the most naturally gifted English players around, and now we are seeing that talent tested against the best. Manchester United\u2019s centre-back Maya Le Tissier received her first senior England call-up before Christmas and has become an instant mainstay at her club after moving from Brighton. Surprisingly, she has chipped in with some goals too."

                    "body": "Morocco With one delightful chip, Moroccan right-back Achraf Hakimi knocked Spain out of the World Cup, but more importantly, united the Arab and African diaspora behind his side, making them both the default home team and the only team left to support.  This team of underdogs have lit up the competition and ignited a region that has suffered through decades of pain and violence. They play now for hope, for pride, and for all migrant communities who left their homes for better lives. Often the most intoxicatingly enjoyable part of a World Cup is knowing you are witnessing history. After winning their penalty shootout Morocco players bowed in prostration before their ecstatic fans, an instantly iconic World Cup moment, and a picture shared around the planet, in group chats across the world. Watching them is watching the region finally find something to cheer for. It\u2019s a chance to witness joyous history. How could you say no? Mostafa Rachwani  Argentina Although I will be supporting the ultimate underdogs, Morocco, there is no doubt that if ever there was a player that deserved to win this trophy it would be Lionel Messi. For many football fans like myself, the Argentina great has been the epitome of football for the entirety of our waking lives. Whether it is putting Jerome Boateng on his backside to send Bayern Munich packing in a Champions League semi-final, or single-handedly dismantling Real Madrid\u2019s entire team, time and time again Messi has sent us into complete ecstasy. In my mind there is no doubt that he is the greatest to ever play. I have watched his highlight reel at least once a week for the last decade and it still brings me joy and inspiration every time I see his greatness in action. Now in his last World Cup, there is one chance left for the magic man to finally ascend to his rightful place on the footballing throne.  A win for Argentina is a win for football.  Khaled Al Khawaldeh  England It feels deeply unnatural to suggest anyone support the England national team. After all, a key prerequisite for selection in the England team is Englishness, something I am usually opposed to. But despite that, I am unable to dislike its current crop of players. Marcus Rashford, the Manchester United forward, not only helped to feed millions of hungry children during the pandemic but also shamed a reluctant Tory government into doing the same. His teammates are similarly likable. Jack Grealish\u2019s goal celebration at the World Cup was a tribute to a young fan with cerebral palsy. He also has incredible calf muscle definition. Harry Kane is a vocal mental health advocate. This general sense of England being a team of non-dickheads has been widely noted. At times in recent years the squad, and manager Gareth Southgate, have appeared to be the only sane people left in Britain. But they are also just very fun to watch; from the pure joy of seeing Bukayo Saka dribble at defenders to witnessing 19-year-old Jude Bellingham\u2019s generational talent unfold, and Harry Maguire\u2019s enormous head. They are also playing France in the quarter-finals, a country whose disappointment and heartache should they lose is something the whole world can surely unite around. Michael McGowan  France When it comes to backing a World Cup winner, there\u2019s no favourite like the defending champs. Take it from me, someone who has next to zero knowledge about football. No team has won back-to-back since Brazil in 1958 and 1962, so the improbability of France winning again this year makes them all the more worthy of barracking for.  How do teams like to celebrate after winning the World Cup? With champagne showers. What would that be impossible without? France, obviously. What else do the French love? Striking, of course. For the uninitiated (me, before some recent Googling), the team refused to train during the 2010 World Cup after Nicolas Anelka was dropped from the squad. Solidarit\u00e9! Speaking of strikers, it would be remiss (according to a better informed friend) not to mention the bromance between Olivier Giroud (beautiful man, all-time top scorer for France) and the forward Kylian Mbapp\u00e9. At 23, Mbapp\u00e9 has scored more World Cup goals than anyone his age or younger ever has! He cites Albert Camus in notes! He\u2019s the frontrunner for the Golden Boot and Golden Ball, whatever they are! Which is all to say: Allez, les bleus! Donna Lu  Portugal At recent big tournaments Portugal have often been boring (for neutral fans) or intensely frustrating (if you support them like me). But with exciting youngsters (Rafael Le\u00e3o, Jo\u00e3o Felix), established top players (Bernardo Silva, Bruno Fernandes) and, finally, a more attacking style of play, a makeover is under way. Like an indie band that has always shown flashes of brilliance, it feels like Portugal are about to bring out a critically acclaimed third album. It\u2019s best to jump onboard now. But what about You Know Who? For many, captain and (arguable) \u201cGoat\u201d Cristiano Ronaldo is as good a reason as any not to support Portugal. Fernando Santos\u2019 dramatic decision to bench him in the first knockout game against Switzerland was monumental. More stunning was his replacement, 21-year-old Gon\u00e7alo Ramos, who repaid the faith with a stunning hat-trick in his first international start. To casual fans (and the football purists who like to go on about the other guy from Argentina) this Portugal is undoubtedly more likable. Forget everything you once knew, Portugal 2.0 is here. And you have permission to like them. Luke Henriques-Gomes  Brazil The first World Cup final I can recall was France 1998. Brazil had already won it four times, were raging favourites \u2013 and yet still seemed to have the rest of the world cheering for them. I bristled and wore a beret to school. Since then, I\u2019ve cheered for anyone but Brazil. Now, after a lifetime of resisting, I\u2019ve finally been seduced by the samba kings. In this era of hyper-professionalism in sport, when football leagues are described as \u201cindustries\u201d and styles of play are \u201cbrands\u201d, there is something pure about the unbridled joy the Sele\u00e7\u00e3o bring to the pitch. It seems they alone remember that team sport is about having fun with your mates. And look, they\u2019ve got a bloke who literally tries to dance like a pigeon and still manages to be sexy. As someone who ends up flapping about like a feral bird on the dancefloor despite my best efforts, I can only applaud. Joe Hinchliffe  The Netherlands As a sport devotee who has a particular penchant for suffering, I am putting my allegiance behind the Netherlands this World Cup. Any lover of the underdog should do the same. Why? The Netherlands hold the record for being in the most World Cup finals without ever having taken home the title. In the 10 tournaments they have qualified for, they have reached the quarter-final stage six times, and have never failed to make it to at least the last 16. They have been runners up three times \u2013 in 1974 to West Germany, in 1978 to Argentina and most recently to Spain in 2010. The Dutch have also never lost a World Cup match \u2013 without going to extra time \u2013 by more than a single goal. It\u2019s heartbreaking, to get so close and yet still be so far. To perform so well, with no reward. It\u2019s exactly why I love football \u2013 the pain, the unfairness of it all. And I lived in Amsterdam for all of a year, so I am basically Dutch. Caitlin Cassidy  Croatia Ask a football fan (and I did) why you should back Croatia, and they might tell you that they were perhaps the least-fancied among the remaining sides to progress, but nonetheless have a sort of unkillable quality. That they are an assembly of grizzled, hard-working veterans capable of suffocating the life out of the more expansive nations, that they are the football purist\u2019s side. But for me, geopolitics, national cuisine and random memories are the most important factors to consider when adopting a foreign World Cup team. Brazil get points for Bolsonaro\u2019s defeat but a penalty for a very beefy diet; the Netherlands crusades against international baddies via The Hague but served me some very dodgy cookies once in Amsterdam.  So yes, I\u2019m going for Croatia, mostly based on a lovely holiday in Dubrovnik ages before it turned into King\u2019s Landing and filled up with cruise tourists. There\u2019s a photo of me looking young and tanned and grinning like an idiot as I drink a large beer in an alleyway. I really enjoyed that time I sat on the beach reading the new Harry Potter that just came out. I also once spent a memorable day walking into the country through a minefield with some Syrian refugees. Go Croatia! (Let\u2019s not mention the xenophobic supporters\u2019 chants.) Nick Miller "

The start from Wyatt was so important, Sophia and Alice have been batting so well so far, and it\u2019s so crucial. We\u2019d been building well into this tournament, we hadn\u2019t been bowling that well. This was a really good performance.\u201d     4.08pm   England beat Pakistan by 114 runs  20th over: Pakistan 99-9 (Fatima 16) Four byes slip past Amy Jones as both she and Fatima let the ball pass them by. Pakistan knock Ecclestone for three singles before the last wicket. Happy England, glum Pakistan, but handshakes all round.     4.05pm   WICKET!  Nashra Sandhu st Jones b Ecclestone 1 (Pakistan 99-9)  A wicket from the final ball in what is the biggest win in a women\u2019s T20 World Cup \u2013 by a whopping 114 runs. Sandhu misses Ecclestone\u2019s final ball and Jones makes no mistake with the gloves.     4.02pm    19th over: Pakistan 97-8 (Fatima 14) Freya Davies bowls the penultimate over and send downs a slow full toss which Tuba slaps to the rope. Emboldened, she then shovels the ball high and into the hands of KSB who catches the ball over over the boundary. Alas, the scrambled egg run out follows.     4.01pm   WICKET! Tuba run out (Capsey-Davies) 28 (Pakistan 91-8)   A horlicks of a run-out spoils Tuba\u2019s cameo after she jogs a run half-heartedly thinking the ball has crossed the rope, ambles back and even as she sees the ball being returned moves in slow motion and is out by a stride      3.54pm    18th over: Pakistan 80-7 (Fatima 13, Tuba 17) A one-handed slap by Fatima off collar-bone high full toss from Ecclestone, and a no-ball is called. The shadows sweep around the boundary edges. Two overs left, 134 needed.      3.50pm    17th over: Pakistan 77-7 (Fatima 12, Tuba 16) Davies, jaunty pony tail, bounces in. Nearly another run-out as Tuba goes for a quick single before changing her mind. Wyatt\u2019s somewhat lugubrious throw doesn\u2019t beat the diving batter \u2013 though the third umpire takes their time on the decision.      3.47pm    15th over: Pakistan 74-7 (Fatima 10, Tuba 15) Tuba tucks into a full toss from Dean and shimmies it through the covers for four. Fatima loses her feet to manoeuvre the ball round the field and Tuba\u2019s dab over mi-off brings two more past Ecclestone running in slow-mo. A double figure over for Pakistan!     3.44pm    15th over: Pakistan 64-7 (Fatima 9, Tuba 6) A mixture of flight and flat-ones by Glenn, as Knight encourages her charges to stay on the job.     3.41pm    14th over: Pakistan 62-7 (Fatima 8, Tuba 5) Charlie Dean approaches with her rapid run out. Pakistan pick her off for six relatively easy runs. The camera pans to Nida Dar, sitting alone on the concrete step outside the dressing room, hand on chin.     3.38pm    13th over: Pakistan 56-7 (Fatima 7, Tuba 1 ) On the grassy banks of Newlands, the fans loll back and applaud Pakistan\u2019s fifty. Twenty-one year old Fatima off-drives KSB beautifully for four before losing her partner in a fuzzy run-out.      3.37pm   WICKET! Sidra run out (Nat Sciver-Brunt) 12 (Pakistan 54-7)  Mishap follows mix-up as Sidra Amin tries to scurry a run from the non-striker\u2019s end, rapdily rethinks \u2013 but too slowly \u2013 and NSB throws down the stumps.   Updated at 4.02pm GMT    3.33pm    12th over: Pakistan 49-6 (Fatima 2,Sidra 1 ) Ecclestone not the light relief Pakistan were hoping for \u2013 they manage a single.       3.31pm    11th over: Pakistan 48-6 (Fatima 2,Sidra 1 ) Heather Knight ringing the changes, beckons KSB back on. She drops a couple of wides into the mix before sending Aliya on her way. Not long for this tournament, a brow-beaten Pakistan.     3.29pm   WICKET! Aliya c Knight b KSB 5 (Pakistan 47-6)  Aliya launches into an off cutter, tips it into the heavens and Knight grabs on with both hands at cover. Happy captain, happy team.   Updated at 4.01pm GMT    3.24pm    10th over: Pakistan 44-4 (Aliya 5, Fatima 1) Nine from the wicket-taking over, after Aliya Riaz gets a lucky thick edge down which rattles along to the boundary.     3.21pm   WICKET! Sidra Ameen c KSB b Dean 12 (Pakistan 39-5)  Pakistan crumbling in the face of England\u2019s huge total. Sidra Ameen plays an ugly spatular shot to Katherine Sciver-Brunt who collects at long on. And we take DRINKS!   Updated at 3.37pm GMT    3.19pm    9th over: Pakistan 35-4 ( Sidra Ameen 8, Aliya 1) And England will avoid Australia in the semi-final! A match against the hosts or New Zealand \u2013 depending on the result of the match later today \u2013 awaits. Huge applause from the knowledgeable England fans.     3.16pm   WICKET! Dar st Jones b Glenn 11 (Pakistan 33-4)  The stand-in captain\u2019s miserable match gets worse when she skips down the wicket, tries to smack Glenn into the shady sheets and is neatly stumped.   Updated at 3.25pm GMT    3.13pm    8th over: Pakistan 31-3 (Nida Dar 10, Sidra Ameen 6) Ecclestone in her raspberry boots, takes the first over at the end of the power play. Pakistan aren\u2019t fazed though, picking off runs \u2013 including a reverse sweep for two.     3.11pm    7th over: Pakistan 27-3 (Nida Dar 9 , Sidra Ameen 3) No rest for Pakistan as Sarah Glenn takes her first over. The flags are limp \u2013 and the smoke from the braais rises vertically. Three singles and three dots \u2013 with Pakistan needing over 14 an over for a miracle.  Updated at 3.12pm GMT    3.07pm    6th over: Pakistan 20-3 (Nida Dar 8, Sidra Ameen 1) A quiet over for Pakistan until Dar helps Davies over fine leg for four.     3.06pm    5th over: Pakistan 19-3 (Nida Dar 4, Sidra Ameen 0) A timely/consolation boundary for Pakistan as Nida Dar dabs to the fine leg rope.     3.04pm   WICKET! Omaima Sohail c Davies b N Sciver-Brunt 9 (Pakistan 15-3)  Ooof, there goes another as Omaima eyes up the rope but can only screech it to Davies at fine leg who runs and gathers. Not a bad afternoon\u2019s work for NSB.   Updated at 3.09pm GMT    3.00pm    4th over: Pakistan 15-21 (Omaima 9) Charlie Dean gets the nod for the third over of the day \u2013 starts with a wide and finishes with a wicket.  Updated at 3.04pm GMT    2.59pm   WICKET! Muneeba c Jones b Dean 3 (Pakistan 15-2)   The century maker against Pakistan has to plod off, bat up by her ears, sweeping one that wasn\u2019t for sweeping and top edging high and into the gloves of the strolling Amy Jones.     2.55pm    3rd over: Pakistan 11-1 (Omaima 7, Muneeba 2) On the money today, KSB, zoning in at the stumps, the sun high over Table Mountain. Just a single from the over. And, in pleasing news for England fans, Pakistan would have to chase England\u2019s total down in nine overs for England to have to face Australia in the semi-finals.      2.51pm    2nd over: Pakistan 10-1 (Omaima 6, Muneeba 2) Davies\u2019 first two balls are a wide and a no-ball with her foot too wide on the return crease. A beautiful cover drive from Omaima races to the rope.       2.47pm    1st over: Pakistan 2-1 (Omaima 1, Muneeba 1) Katherine Sciver-Brunt puts the nightmare of the last game to rest with a wicket with her second ball.      2.44pm   WICKET! Sadaf Shamas c Jones b  K Sciver-Brunt 0 (Pakistan 0-1)  Not the ideal start for Pakistan, as Sadaf Shamas goes neither soft nor hard, but leaden-footed, and top edges to the keeper.   Updated at 3.06pm GMT    2.42pm   Pakistan to chase 214 to win  I take that back, no time for tea, just toast and peanut butter. Anyway, here we are, Katherine Sciver-Brunt with the ball and Pakistan ready to start their record-breaking chase\u2026     2.37pm    20th over: England 213-5 (N Sciver-Brunt 81) Wow! The highest score ever in a women\u2019s T20 World Cup. Pakistan had no answer to the power hitting and precision of England, of Wyatt and NSB in particular. A couple of boundaries from Fatima\u2019s final over \u2013 bringing up the hundred partnership between Jones and Nat Sciver-Brunt in just 46 balls. Mumbai Indians will be delighted with their costly purchase.  Time for a quick cup of tea before we restart with Pakistan chasing 214.     2.32pm   WICKET! Jones c Tuba b Fatima  (England 213-5)  Slams the last ball of the innings \u2013 a slower one \u2013 into the stratosphere and down into the hands of deep midwicket \u2013 who drops it on the first take but saves her blushes with a timely grab with her right hand.   Updated at 2.38pm GMT    2.29pm    19th over: England 202-4 (N Sciver-Brunt 76, Jones 41) Amy Jones slams Nashra Sandu for six over square leg as England pass two hundred \u2013 the first time a team has passed 200 in a Women\u2019s T20 World Cup. A possible stumping of Jones from the last ball \u2013 which the replay actually shows was out. \u201cWhat with \u2018pancaking\u2019 a shot or passing a \u2018pudding basin\u2019 fielder, we can guess what impact Shrove Tuesday is having on your screed,\u201d writes John Starbuck. \u201cAs the designated cook for today\u2019s dessert in our household I can sympathise, but really it should just look after itself if you keep it simple.\u201d I wish I had your confidence\u2026 \u201cIncidentally, I see the earlier reference to your email address still includes \u2018guardian.co.uk\u2018, but in my address box it shows up as \u2018theguardian.com\u2018. Perhaps there\u2019s a glitch in your system?\u201d Ah \u2013 yes, the guardian.com, my mistake.     2.24pm    18th over: England 192-4 (N Sciver-Brunt 75, Jones 32) Sadia can\u2019t stop the run leaks.. Three for Amy Jones, then NSB drops to the off side and sweeps four. And another sweep and another boundary. A single brings Jones to the strike and she pulls four again legside, before picking up three past backward point. And Pakistan\u2019s fielders kindly contribute by diving over the ball and slipping on banana skins.      2.19pm    17th over: England 173-4 (N Sciver-Brunt 66, Jones 22) Nida Dar rolls up for her last over and in an attempt to contain NSB. It doesn\u2019t work, as she sweep her first ball for four. Then Jones joins in, reverse-sweeping to the rope before powering another. Runs on runs \u2013 and NSB now has the largest collection in this World Cup with 161 and counting.     2.15pm   Fifty for Nat Sciver-Brunt!  16th over: England 159-4 (N Sciver-Brunt 61, Jones 13) Nat Sciver-Brunt effortless out there, reaching fifty down on one knee, and following that boundary with two more \u2013 a pull and a meaty drive over cover for six.   Updated at 2.40pm GMT    2.12pm    15th over: England 143-4 (N Sciver-Brunt 46, Jones 11) Events! Pakistan\u2019s bowlers are not being helped by their fielders out there today \u2013 Nat Sciver Brunt turns the ball to short fine leg where the fielder kneels performatively but somehow misses the ball. Jones gets hit in the guts by a full toss from Fatima which cuts her in half and is called no ball. Then \u2013 and this is so unlucky for Pakistan, the keeper whips off her gloves to take a return \u2013 and the ball hits the grounded glove. Finally, another waist-high full toss \u2013 and chat about whether Fatima should be removed from the attack. Answer: no.      2.03pm    14th over: England 125-4 (N Sciver-Brunt 41, Jones 6) A fumble on the boundary by Dar, brings Jones her first boundary.      2.02pm    13th over: England 119-4 (N Sciver-Brunt 40, Jones 1) Dar becomes the leading wicket-taker in T20s with the wicket of Knight, and nearly sweeps up a second when Jones top-edges first ball, just past a pudding basin fine leg who doesn\u2019t pick up the ball in time. Unpeturbed, Nat SB, shovels square for four.     1.57pm   WICKET! Knight c Nashra b Dar 3 (England  113-4)  A slog-sweep, but there isn\u2019t enough power on it to reach the long boundaries at Newlands. Nicely taken by Nashra who is mindful of her feet placings.      1.55pm    12th over: England 111-3 (N Sciver-Brunt 34, Knight 3) Just six off the over and a vital wicket for Pakistan as Wyatt and N Sciver-Brunt needed little oil to grease their gears in a threatening partnership.     1.52pm   WICKET! Wyatt c S Amin  b Tuba 59 (England 107-3)  Dances down the pitch, lofts the ball to long off where a be-sunglassed Amin takes the ball at chest height, peddling backwards. She\u2019s frustrated with herself but it has been a cracking knock and hopefull bedded a few daemons.     1.49pm   Fifty for Danni Wyatt!  11th over: England 105-2 (N Sciver-Brunt 34, Wyatt 57) Newlands looking a picture \u2013 a scattered crowd making a good noise, with more expected later when South Africa take on Bangladesh. Those beautiful trees \u2013 that beautiful mountain\u2026 anyway, the cricket \u2013 wham bam 16 off Nashra\u2019s over. Wyatt reaches fifty with a sweep and celebrates next ball by pancaking a full toss over square leg. It\u2019s her first fifty in a T20 World Cup.     1.44pm    10th over: England 89-2 (N Sciver-Brunt 31, Wyatt 44) The fifty partnership comes up with a beauty from Nat Sciver-Brunt, who skips, angles and thuds Tuba Hassan through the covers for four. She and Wyatt continue to gobble up singles, taking risks but falling safe.  John Starbuck, hello!  \u201cNot that I wish the Kiwis any ill-will but it would be better for the tournament if South Africa feature in the semi-final. A more engaged crowd always provides improved excitement.\u201d Always hoping for home side involvement for a long as possible in a tournament.     1.39pm    9th over: England 80-2 (N Sciver-Brunt 23, Wyatt 43) Nashra with her slinging left arm restores some sanity. On comms they were commenting on Wyatt having a point to prove. A week ago, here was her heartbroken reaction to not being picked up in the IPL.      1.36pm    8th over: England 75-2 (N Sciver-Brunt 20, Wyatt 41) Awww that\u2019s gorgeous, Sciver Brunt drives through the covers and finishes on one leg just to prove her perfect balance. If I had to place her, I\u2019d plonk her exactly in the zone. And there goes Wyatt on the sweep, stretching forward to make the most of her little frame, and picking up another four. Pakistan struggling to contain these two.  Updated at 1.37pm GMT    1.33pm    7th over: England 63-2 (N Sciver-Brunt 13, Wyatt 36) Thanks very much says N Sciver-Brunt to Nashra Sandhu, stepping past off-stump, kneeling deep to sweep, and powering the ball to the rope. A handful of singles and another hearty over for England.     1.28pm    6th over: England 55-2 (N Sciver-Brunt 7, Wyatt 34) Full length outside off and Danni Wyatt launches into the stand-in Pakistan captain with a flourishing lofted drive. A boundary for Sciver-Brunt too, 13 from Dar\u2019s first over and a hearty total, with extra roast potatoes, at the end of the power play.     1.25pm    5th over: England 42-2 (N Sciver-Brunt 1, Wyatt 27) Wyatt holding the innings together, with two banging fours from Sadia\u2019s last two balls after another wicket in the power play for Pakistan.  Updated at 1.25pm GMT    1.23pm   WICKET! Capsey b Sadia Iqbal 6 (England 33-2)  Capsey plumps for a sweep but misses \u2013 and looks as fed up as her now disjointed off stump.   Updated at 1.40pm GMT    1.21pm    4th over: England 33-1 (Capsey 6, Wyatt 19) Fatima, black headband slipping down her forehead, skids into Wyatt who is squinting under the brim of her helmet. She steers the ball behind her boots and down to backward point for four \u2013 very nicely done. That\u2019s 12 off the over after a thudding four from Capsey.     1.16pm    3rd over: England 21-1 (Capsey 1, Wyatt 12) The tall Sadia troubles Capsey, who nearly gets a leading edge and then lobs just short of long on. A quick single to switch the strike \u2013 but just three from it.  You aren\u2019t the only one to be asking this question Duncan Mcminn. Lauren Bell has officially been rested \u2013 perhaps for the semi \u2013 and I assume Knight just believes in and wants Brunt\u2019s experience \u2013 she\u2019s pulled England out of so many holes in the past.     1.11pm    2nd over: England 18-1 (Capsey 0, Wyatt 10) Fatima opens with a boomeranging ball that flies past the diving keeper and down to the rope. A no ball follows \u2013 and a free hit which reaches mid-off for no run. Dar doesn\u2019t look that impressed but is soon smiling when Dunkley dobs straight to the fielder.     1.10pm   WICKET! Dunkley c Nashra  b Fatima 2 (England 18-1)   Dunkley leans back, looks unbalanced, and thuds the ball straight to mid on. After a troubled over, Fatima leaps in delight.     1.04pm    1st over: England 10-0 (Dunkley 0, Wyatt 10) After a wait for the clock to tick round, Sadia Iqbal opens the bowling with her gentle looking left arm spin. Wyatt watches the first three obediently before driving the fourth through point for four and lumping the fifth for six.     12.58pm    Our Raf is perturbed:      12.57pm    Do send me your thoughts, idle or otherwise, either via twitter: @tjaldred or email me on tanya.aldred.freelance@guardian.co.uk.     12.55pm    The teams march out, under perfect bluebell skies, holding hands with the mascots. Now for the anthems: Pakistan sing along with hands on their hearts and suncream on their faces. England, arms over each others shoulders, sunglasses free, belt along to an operatic version of God Save the King.     12.47pm    All roads lead to Australia, but the aim is to put that off as long as possible. If England beat Pakistan, they will avoid the Aussies in the semis and play either South Africa or New Zealand depending on if South Africa beat Bangladesh later.      12.42pm   Pakistan XI  Sadaf Shamas, Muneeba Ali Siddiqui, Omaima Sohail, Nida Dar (c), Aliya Riaz, Sidra Amin, Fatima Sana Khan, Sidra Nawaz (wk), Nashra Sandhu, Tuba Hassan, Sadia Iqbal.     12.41pm   England XI   Danni Wyatt, Sophia Dunkley, Alice Capsey, Nat Sciver-Brunt, Heather Knight (c), Amy Jones (wk), Katherine Sciver-Brunt, Sophie Ecclestone, Sarah Glenn, Charlie Dean, Freya Davies.     12.40pm    Nida Dar, in her first outing as Pakistan captain, and with an impressively elaborate sweeping hairstyle, speaks to Nasser Hussain. Two changes for Pakistan: Bismah Mahroof and Aamin Anwer miss out replaced by Sadaf Shamas and Sidra Nawaz.     12.35pm   England win the toss and will bat!  Knight calls heads and chooses to bat on a lovely looking pitch. There is one change from the last game \u2013 but it isn\u2019t Brunt who sits out but Lauren Bell. Davies replaces her.     12.31pm    News from the ground is that Freya Davies is warming up \u2013 perhaps no room for Brunt today after that tricky time in the last game.      12.27pm     All change at the top for Pakistan, after captain Bismah Mahroof sits out after picking up a strain during the game against West Indies last week. Nida Dar wears the captain\u2019s armband today.     12.23pm   Preamble  Good morning! Here we are already at match 19 in a competition that is speeding on into the knock-out stages, as England take on Pakistan. Favourites Australia have already topped Group A, winning all of their games. Hot on their tails England qualified for the semi-finals when Pakistan lost to West Indies, with India claiming second spot in the group after beating Ireland. England will finish top of Group B unless they are thrashed by Pakistan today at a cloudless Newlands \u2013 unlikely, as England have won 13 of the last 14 ODIs between the two sides. England\u2019s nine-match winning streak \u2013 topped off by an 11-run victory over India last Saturday - has been done with much elbow grease from Sophie Ecclestone and Sarah Glenn in particular ,and a decent hand from the batters. Pakistan are looking for a second consolation victory before they head home. The action starts at 1pm GMT.   Updated at 12.28pm GMT "

                    "body": "They keep looking for each other on the pitch. Just like they always did. Stealing little glances over their shoulder, like ex-lovers secretly stalking each other on Facebook. Occasionally as they pass each other they will share a brief word, a hand on the small of the back. It needs nothing more than this. They\u2019re professionals, doing a job. And yet somehow it feels comforting, almost validating, to know they are not alone.\nAnd Luka Modric and Casemiro are rarely alone. For more than two hours as Brazil and Croatia duel in the desert, these two midfielders yoke themselves together, their fates divergent and yet intertwined, like a habit they just can\u2019t kick. They even swap shirts at half-time. And for the majority of the game, with the exception of the very end, they are within about 10 yards of each other.\nIt still feels strange seeing them in different colours. Modric and Casemiro both joined Real Madrid in the summer of 2013, and in those nine years grew around each other like climbing plants. \u201cYou have been the best bodyguard in the world,\u201d Modric wrote in a letter to Casemiro after the Brazilian\u2019s move to Manchester United in the summer.\n\nCasemiro, Modric, Toni Kroos: this was the midfield triangle that dominated an entire Champions League era. But despite playing 259 matches together, this is only Modric\u2019s and Casemiro\u2019s second meeting as opponents. And yet somehow, even on opposite teams, the telepathy is still there. Early on Modric runs into the right channel and somehow Casemiro intuits that he is going to turn back on himself, and is waiting with a meaty block tackle.\n\nModric, meanwhile, has done his homework. He knows that with five attacking players, virtually everything Brazil do funnels through Casemiro. Stop his friend, and he essentially stops Brazil. So he stations himself high, almost steals a pass from goalkeeper Alisson, forces Brazil to move the ball wide and long. Over the first 90 minutes of the game, Casemiro will complete just 49 passes. In the game against South Korea, he completed 73.\nSometimes Casemiro and Modric try to shake each other off. Here Casemiro has a clear disadvantage: Modric can roam, he can\u2019t. In a team of party boys, Casemiro needs to be the sensible one, the designated driver. While Modric peels away to the right flank, knowing that Marcelo Brozovic and Mateo Kovacic will cover his space, Casemiro sits, knowing that nobody will cover his. Set pieces offer Casemiro\u2019s only chance of escape: throwing himself into the melee while the tiny Modric watches from afar, like a kid banned from the big rides at Thorpe Park.\nExtra time. Modric and Casemiro, like Croatia and Brazil, are still cancelling each other out. But their grip is loosening as the game stretches and the limbs tire. During breaks in play Modric bends double, hands on his thighs, gasping some air into his lungs. Casemiro\u2019s gait is leaden and heavy, barely able to break beyond a jog. The fresh new shirt he donned at half-time is smeared with mud and sweat. They are like Jack and Rose, clinging to the same wardrobe door at the end of Titanic. They love each other dearly. But one\u2019s got to go.\n\nAnd when Neymar scores, neither is anywhere to be seen. As Brazil celebrate wildly in the corner, Casemiro simply collapses, face to the turf. He\u2019s spent, overwhelmed, overcome. But \u2013 crucially \u2013 he also thinks it\u2019s done.\nMeanwhile, Modric watches Brazil celebrate. Adjusts his hairband. He was always a player who had all the time, and now he has just a little more. He knows it\u2019s not done.\n\nPerhaps ultimately, penalties was the only fitting way to end it. Casemiro scores his penalty, and then does a lovely thing. He picks up the ball and personally hands it to his friend Modric, who also scores.\nThis is definitely Modric\u2019s last World Cup, and possibly Casemiro\u2019s too. They may not ever play each other again. \u201cI\u2019m going to miss you,\u201d Modric wrote in his letter this summer. \u201cThanks for everything and good luck, friend.\u201d\nDid Modric win the duel, then? Football certainly loves to paint these things in black and white: this thing bad, this thing good, this friend, this enemy. But the world isn\u2019t as simple as that. Part of the reason Casemiro is such a good player for Brazil is because of the education he got from playing alongside Modric. Part of the reason Modric won here was because he had Brozovic and Kovacic and Casemiro had nobody.\nThe game is won and the game is lost, and perhaps that\u2019s all we can say with any certainty. And so at full-time, as Brazil commiserate, a man in a yellow shirt rises from the mourning. As Croatia rejoice, a man in a white and red shirt breaks away from the fracas. It\u2019s Casemiro, and it\u2019s Modric. And they\u2019re looking for each other again."

                    "body": "All aboard the Scaloneta. There is standing room only on the blue and white bus with Lionel Scaloni at the wheel, next stop the World Cup final: an entire country packed in, everyone right behind him, squeezed together, singing. It was not always this way but as Muchachos, the song that has become the soundtrack of the last month, puts it: Argentina, land of Maradona and Messi that cried so many years, has its hope back. They have come a long way fast, and so has he, leading them back to Lusail on Sunday evening.\nScaloni was in a hotel gym in Spain when the AFA called four years ago, his first senior squad drawn up that evening as he walked along the beach with Pablo Aimar. There to coach the under-20s in L\u2019Alc\u00fadia, his may not have been the first number they dialled but he answered. \u201cNobody wanted to take the national team,\u201d admits Nicol\u00e1s Tagliafico, among seven survivors from 2018.\nInitially he was named interim manager for two games. Two more followed, then two more: \u201cThere wasn\u2019t time to find a replacement,\u201d he says. He had just seven caps, recently turned 40, and no experience. \u201d Diego Maradona complained: \u201cHe\u2019s a great lad but he can\u2019t even direct traffic. How can you give the national team to Scaloni? Are we all mad? Eat an asado, fine, but coach a national team?! It\u2019s way too big for you, like Minguito Tinguitella wearing Gordo Porcel\u2019s suit.\u201d Porcel and Tinguitella are a comedy duo, an Argentinian Laurel and Hardy if you like, and Porcel is the fat one.\n\nHow things change. Maradona was not alone in doubting and that spell taking it two games at a time was not exactly a ringing endorsement, but a connection was building, an identification: a \u201cchemistry\u201d in Scaloni\u2019s words. The national team was becoming the Scaloneta \u2013 his national team. A metaphor \u2013 it could be a ship he captained as well as a bus \u2013 this was a journey where ever more passengers came aboard. And although Scaloni does not like the title, preferring to point to his players, by the time they beat Ecuador in the 2021 Copa Am\u00e9rica quarter-final, it had gathered a momentum that felt irreversible.\nIt is now. Long after Scaloni sat in the stands with his wife, Elisa, and two sons, Ian and Noah, the few fans left inside serenading him. He insisted he could not be compared with Menotti, Bilardo or Sabella but what he could yet achieve may even be greater. The sun will come up tomorrow, he is fond of saying, and boy has it. At 44, in his first senior management job, he has taken Argentina from crisis to a Copa Am\u00e9rica, their first trophy in 28 years, to the Finalissima win against Italy as European champions, a 36-game unbeaten run and now a World Cup final.\nNo one expected this. Well, almost no one. If Scaloni is an unexpected hero, those who know him saw something. The World Cup\u2019s youngest coach has not come from nowhere. It is there in the personality and the preparation. A simplicity, a directness about him which friends link to a chacarero culture: a farming lifestyle. Which he does too, in fact. Talking to those who worked with him, the same words keep recurring: passionate, determined, funny, competitive. An extrovert, he likes to talk. Empathy keeps coming round too. Spend time with him and he is surprisingly, well, normal.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard for me to speak about him because we\u2019re great friends but when they chose him, I was delighted. Many had doubts but he has the perfect mix. He\u2019s very Argentinian but played in Europe: he has the possession and touch of Spain, the tactics of Italy,\u201d says Leo Franco, who met Scaloni at 18, a teammate with Argentina Under-20s and Mallorca, and was his classmate on a coaching course.\n\u201cI\u2019ve watched his sessions and he has an incredible capacity to lead but afterwards he sits chatting with players. It\u2019s striking how natural he is. In Argentina we\u2019re very, very, very results driven and until he won the Copa Am\u00e9rica maybe his abilities weren\u2019t as visible, but I was always convinced.\u201d\nThe then Uruguay manager, \u00d3scar \u201cMaestro\u201d Tab\u00e1rez, pulled Scaloni aside in his first year and told him to ignore those who said he had no experience: Scaloni had \u201clived\u201d, he said. Raised in Pujato, where his family worked the land, Scaloni says there was always a manager inside, a collective conscience that colleagues saw quickly. \u201cHe was focused on the group, whether he played 90 minutes or two,\u201d recalls Slavisa Jokanovic, a teammate in Scaloni\u2019s first European season. Gregorio Manzano, his coach at Mallorca, says: \u201cHe was competitive, generous and empathised. You saw in the attention he paid that it wasn\u2019t just playing he liked; it was the game.\u201d\nScaloni took his first coaching badges in Rome in 2011. Winner of league and cup at Deportivo, he felt they should have won more and found in Italy the tactical depth he missed in A Coru\u00f1a. If he had a regret it was not going sooner, but Spain had become home, far from the noise of Argentina. He coached a Mallorcan kids\u2019 team before joining Jorge Sampaoli\u2019s staff at Sevilla, then the national team, and took his Fifa pro licence with the Spanish federation, the new selecci\u00f3n coach, Luis de la Fuente, among the teachers.\n\nAt Las Rozas Scaloni stood out. If anyone anticipated his success it is the class of 2018. \u201cHe was destined to be a coach. He loves football. The teachers would put a subject on the table for debate and he had a great ability to argue his case,\u201d says Pablo Orbaiz, a former Spain international now working in the Osasuna academy.\n\u201cHe has a gift, something special,\u201d says Ayoze Garc\u00eda, another classmate and former teammate. \u201cHe\u2019s a leader. As a player, he would be close to the coach, taking it in. On the course he had an ascendancy. He would come up with new ideas. You\u2019d think: \u2018That\u2019s mad,\u2019 and then: \u2018Actually, it could work.\u2019 Put in practice, it did.\u201d\nGica Craioveanu was there too. \u201cThere were two on the course I would have bet on making it: him and [current Rayo Vallecano coach] Andoni Iraola,\u201d he says, then he cracks up. \u201cAnd he owes me dinner. He said he liked three centre-backs, I said [a back] four and I see he\u2019s used that at the World Cup.\u201d\n\u201cI was sure he would coach,\u201d Iraola agrees, laughing. \u201cHe was so competitive, determined. After classes, some would stay to play football tennis. And if he had to cheat to beat you, he would cheat. And he always ended up winning. Watching Argentina, I see his character. There was theory, practical sessions, but the best part was the debates, arguments. And Scaloni was always right in the middle.\u201d\nThere is a richness in that exchange of ideas, in the value of listening, finding shared solutions, that is reflected in Scaloni\u2019s choice of backroom staff: Aimar, Walter Samuel and Roberto Ayala. Those names say something of Scaloni\u2019s humility and intelligence, classmates insist. There is a connection with players and a depth of tactical analysis, too. That capacity has perhaps been overlooked even though it has played out clearly, Argentina shifting through footballers and formations, demonstrating a fundamental flexibility. \u201cWe have a great technical staff that leave nothing to chance. What they tell you before every game happens,\u201d Lionel Messi says.\n\n\u201cTactically he\u2019s incredible: he learned how to structure his ideas, especially in Italy,\u201d Franco says. \u201cI could see it: there\u2019s a coach here. Some said: \u2018He doesn\u2019t have a style.\u2019 They were laughing, dismissive. Too many don\u2019t see that football evolves but he does. The two finalists aren\u2019t coaches who say: \u2018I have a system I\u2019m not changing.\u2019 You have to control every aspect. You need five at the back? Five. You need four? Four. Need the ball? Have it. If you have to kick it into the stands, kick it. Five forwards? Five forwards. He sees that.\u201d\n\u201cScaloni has probably been the World Cup\u2019s most interventionist coach,\u201d Iraola says. \u201cHe\u2019s worked on various systems, allowing them to shift during games. In terms of individual talent there are probably five or six teams a level above them, but he\u2019s constructed a team.\u201d\nThat has meant a structure that serves Messi and is served by Messi. Simple? As his classmates analyse the captain\u2019s role, it is clear it is not. A potential candidate as Argentina coach, meanwhile, privately admits that the Messi question is a reason that some did not want the job. In short, making it work \u2013 \u201cand which Messi are we talking about?\u201d one 2018 graduate notes \u2013 is not so easy. As Orbaiz says: \u201cMessi\u2019s had many coaches and they haven\u2019t been able to do this. Scaloni has.\u201d\nHe adds: \u201cScaloni had the bravery to take Argentina on and his group management, the union he has built, pfff \u2026 it\u2019s brutal what he\u2019s done, brutal. The demands are so, so big: very few people understand the pressure he\u2019s exposed himself to and he deserves enormous credit.\u201d\nSo now here comes the Scaloneta, arriving at the final. \u201cIt all comes back to the same thing: when Leo has an objective, he meets it,\u201d Franco says. \u201cSeeing him reach the final makes me just tremendously happy, for him and his family \u2013 because when you\u2019re a coach it\u2019s not just you who suffers. And as for the Scaloneta, there\u2019s something very important: he\u2019s given Argentinians back the passion for the shirt.\u201d"

                    "body": "Reece James has been left devastated after Gareth Southgate told Chelsea\u2019s injured right-back that he will not be named in England\u2019s World Cup squad. James has been pushing to recover for Qatar since sustaining a knee ligament injury against Milan last month. He was confident of being available for the knockout stages but Southgate has decided that he cannot gamble on the defender\u2019s fitness. England\u2019s opening game against Iran is on 21 November and there have been indications that James will not be fit until December.  It is another huge blow for England\u2019s manager, who has lost the Chelsea left-back Ben Chilwell to a torn hamstring. Southgate, who names his 26-man squad on Thursday, also faces a difficult decision on Manchester City\u2019s Kalvin Phillips and Kyle Walker. However there is growing confidence that Southgate will take a risk on Phillips. The midfielder has been out since surgery on a shoulder injury in September but is set to feature in City\u2019s Carabao Cup tie against Chelsea on Wednesday. Walker, who underwent groin surgery last month, is also believed to have a good chance of being picked by Southgate. England have depended on Walker, who can play at right-back and right centre-back, for his speed. However they must adjust without James, who was favourite to start at right wing-back. The 22-year-old had been in outstanding form before his injury. He resumed jogging outside this week and was hopeful of proving his fitness to Southgate. There was no guarantee, though, of James being ready for England\u2019s group games against Iran, Wales and the USA. James tweeted on Wednesday: \u201cDevastated. The minute I injured my knee, I knew the turnaround to make the World Cup would be tight, but I always felt it was possible. I\u2019ve worked harder than I ever thought I could to give myself the best chance of going and truly believed I could help the team. I appreciate there was a risk on both sides but it was one I was willing to take. Good luck to the boys.\u201d Southgate is expected to adjust by using Newcastle\u2019s Kieran Trippier at right wing-back. James\u2019s absence is also likely to mean good news for Liverpool\u2019s Trent Alexander-Arnold, and there could also be good news for Ben White. The Arsenal centre-back has excelled at right-back for his club this season. Defence is the big concern for England. The Manchester United centre-back Harry Maguire has started one Premier League game since August and Chilwell\u2019s absence has limited Southgate\u2019s options on the left. Chilwell was hopeful of competing with Luke Shaw for a spot at wing-back. Southgate could pick Tottenham\u2019s Ryan Sessegnon or Crystal Palace\u2019s Tyrick Mitchell, but James Justin was injured during Leicester\u2019s win over Newport on Tuesday. Southampton\u2019s Kyle Walker-Peters has also been injured. Southgate could choose to use Trippier as cover for Shaw. Arsenal\u2019s Bukayo Saka has played at left wing-back for England. The main decision in attack for Southgate is whether to recall Marcus Rashford, who has made a fine start to the season for Manchester United. Tammy Abraham, Ivan Toney and Callum Wilson are competing for spots as Harry Kane\u2019s deputy up front."

                    "body": "There was to be no melodrama. There were few tears and even fewer words. \u201cDead silence,\u201d was how Jonas Hofmann described the Germany dressing room in the aftermath of its most pyrrhic victory, a 4-2 win over Costa Rica that still led to their elimination.\n\u201cIt\u2019s so bitter, I have no words,\u201d said a crestfallen Serge Gnabry. Ilkay G\u00fcndogan, his belongings wrapped in a bin bag, dragged himself through the mixed zone mumbling a few things about disappointment. Kai Havertz posed with his unwanted player-of-the-match award like a man clutching his divorce papers.\nOthers were simply mourning, wondering what more they could have done, what it all meant. \u201cI joined in 2016,\u201d Joshua Kimmich considered. \u201cBefore that Germany was always in the semi-finals. Then I come along and we are eliminated twice in the preliminary round, and last year in the round of 16. I\u2019m personally connected to this failure.\u201d The next few days will be the toughest. Germany will grieve. Germany will reflect. The really interesting part is what Germany does next.\n\nBecause \u2013 paradoxically \u2013 a lot of things actually went right for them here. Their expected goals and expected goal difference were the highest not just in their group, but in the whole tournament. With the exception of 20 minutes against Japan and maybe 15 against Costa Rica, they played pretty competent football. This was the month when a brilliant 19-year-old called Jamal Musiala put the world on notice. And yet in the post-match debriefs the same word kept cropping up: efficiency.\nYou can write your own jokes there. But this has been Germany\u2019s fatal flaw: a failure to convert attacks into chances and chances into goals, a failure to get a grip on the game when it begins to tilt against them, a failure to make the most of the players at Hansi Flick\u2019s disposal. \u201cIt\u2019s not just bad luck, it\u2019s also a lot of incompetence,\u201d Kimmich went on. \u201cWe concede goals very easily. An opponent doesn\u2019t have to invest a lot to score cheap goals against us.\u201d\n\nThere are two schools of thought developing in Germany over their World Cup exit. The first is that this failure is merely the symptom of a long-term sickness in German football, an inability to produce the right sort of players, the right variety of players. This was the line taken by Flick when he pointed out that Spain and England were years ahead of Germany in terms of youth development. \u201cThe problems we have had at the World Cup are not only at this World Cup,\u201d agreed the team manager Oliver Bierhoff, who may be the first casualty of this debacle. \u201cIt has been happening for the last three years.\u201d\nA lot is made of Germany\u2019s wealth of talent, a first XI that could stand comparison with any team on the planet. And yet a little interrogation is demanded here. Antonio R\u00fcdiger aside, who is Germany\u2019s next world-class defender? Is the 29-year-old Niclas F\u00fcllkrug really the answer up front? How, in a 26-man squad, did Germany end up in a situation where Kimmich had to return to right-back, leaving them with only two holding midfielders? \u201cDo we really have as many good players as we think?\u201d Thomas Hitzlsperger asked on German television. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be so sure about that.\u201d\n\nThe other school of thought is that very specific things went wrong in Qatar that will not require years of surgery to fix. There remains a suspicion that Flick, in trying to implement his intense, integrated, high-pressing style on the national team, is essentially trying to recreate Bayern Munich on an impossible deadline. Preparation has been minimal; the relationships simply have not had time to develop. G\u00fcndogan hinted at this when he said Germany were \u201cnot able to perform as a team\u201d.\nSo really there are two ways Germany can go from here. There is a European Championship on home soil in barely 18 months. Germany will again be among the favourites and most of the current side \u2013 Flick included \u2013 are keen to continue. So do you rip things up and start again with a new coach, a more pragmatic style, a departure from principles? Or do you keep the faith in a process that has now produced three straight tournament failures? There are no easy answers. Whatever it does, German football is about to embark on a monumental gamble."

For some, confirmation that we have made it came when they saw Wales in a Panini World Cup sticker album, unfinished business from childhood being concluded in middle age. For others it is the uncharacteristic cavalcade of content around the Wales squad. TV documentaries, pages to ourselves in broadsheet pull-outs, journalists who have spent careers covering other teams muttering about \u201cindefatigable team spirit\u201d on podcasts, all complementing the Football Association of Wales\u2019s relentless social media blitz; footage of Gareth Bale putting off Chris Gunter as he tries to pose for his official photo, Ben Davies ruffling Joe Rodon\u2019s hair, the team laughing as they do stretches in the new training kit that is flying off the shelves in Wales.\nFor me it was seeing Cafu, the greatest full-back of all time and the most capped Brazil footballer, welcome Wales to the tournament on behalf of Budweiser by speaking Welsh. \u201cCymru,\u201d he says, resplendent in our 21st\u2011century national dress, the Spirit of \u201958 bucket hat; \u201cCroeso nol\u201d (\u201cWelcome back\u201d).\n\nThe first time I watched Cafu explain that how our qualification had inspired him felt mildly disorienting, like tripping up the stairs, or finding one\u2019s wallet in the fridge. The second time my eyeballs stung with pride. We are announcing ourselves on the world stage. And we are doing it in the Welshest way imaginable.\nThe Empire State Building was lit up in red, blue and white to celebrate the USA players who will contest Group B against Wales, England and Iran. Gareth Southgate announced his squad at St George\u2019s Park, the state-of-the-art facility in Staffordshire where the England teams train. Southgate took questions from the press about James Maddison\u2019s fitness and Trent Alexander-Arnold\u2019s inclusion in front of a wall adorned with the English FA\u2019s corporate sponsors, perfectly reasonable behaviour for the manager of a national football team. Rob Page announced his squad at Tylorstown Welfare Hall, the last remaining miners\u2019 welfare hall in the Rhondda Fach valley, a community facility minutes from where his parents still live. You do it your way. This is how we do it in Wales.\nThere was a time when the FAW comprised dozens of old, white men who would meet in Caersws to make bad decisions. But over the past decade or so a revolution happened around the Wales football team. An organic, fan\u2011led culture has emerged in the stands, feeding off the golden generation that has represented us on the pitch. But the FAW has transformed itself into a modern, progressive governing body staffed by supporters who would be in the Canton end of the Cardiff City Stadium if they were not working at each game in an official capacity.\n\nFor those who remember the daydreaming each failed qualification campaign would bring (\u201cWould Rush and Hughes have found the defences at Mexico 86 as acquiescent as they did those in the English First Division? How would Yorath and Toshack have coped with the heat of Argentina 78? Was Euro 2004 ready for Craig Bellamy?\u201d), what no one imagined as we cried in our pints was a revitalised FAW tapping into a growing sense of Welsh self-confidence, that it would use qualification for football\u2019s biggest stage as a nation\u2011building exercise.\nThe official Wales World Cup song is Yma o Hyd. Originally released in 1983 by Dafydd Iwan, a singer who by 2022 had retired, it was adopted by the players who found its melody stirring and its message inspiring. Yma o Hyd. We\u2019re Still Here. Conceived initially as a retort to Thatcherism, Iwan was asked by the players to perform it before the World Cup playoff semi-final against Austria and a phenomenon was born.\nThe accompanying video has all of the knee\u2011slide celebrations and crowd shots expected from a World Cup single but it is also interspersed with footage of the 1984-85 miners\u2019 strike, Cymdeithas yr Iaith (the Welsh Language Society) demonstrations from the 1960s, and the statue of Betty Campbell, the community activist who became Wales\u2019s first black head teacher. It\u2019s the video you didn\u2019t know you needed; an elated Kieffer Moore interspersed with a crash course in Wales\u2019s radical history. We have waited a long time to tell our story at the world\u2019s largest sporting event. So forgive us if there are a few things we need to get off our chest.\nFootball fans often adopt the character of the team they support, and Welsh fans are no different. A tapas of heartbreak had been filed away in every supporter\u2019s mental Rolodex, creating a fanbase with a healthy sense of humour and world\u2011class resilience to disappointment. But we are no longer defined by failure. Wales are ranked 19th in the world. We have reached three of the past four major tournaments. Just getting to a World Cup has always been the ambition, but no one feels we do not deserve to be there.\n\nI first noticed football\u2019s power for putting Wales in the spotlight during Euro 2016, when taxi drivers and bar owners would shout \u201cGareth Bale!\u201d at Wales fans as we walked around Bordeaux or Toulouse. But when children play football in the street, it\u2019s the World Cup they\u2019re imagining, not the European Championship.\nIn the current scramble for context, one observation about Wales\u2019s first appearance at a World Cup for 64 years struck me like no other. John Charles, Ivor Allchurch and the boys of \u201958 were closer to the first modern Olympics of 1896 than they are to the class of \u201922. Cliff Jones and Terry Medwin, the two remaining members of the 1958 team who played in Sweden, met the present squad last week. Cliff and Terry are 87 and 90 years old respectively, both Swansea boys and Tottenham legends from the double\u2011winning team of 1961, and they chatted convivially to Bale about his fitness before posing for selfies. This current Wales team respects its past. But it is making history.\nElis James has donated his fee for this column to Amnesty International, which is campaigning for Qatar and Fifa to establish a compensation fund for migrant workers."

                    "body": "This isn\u2019t the first time Morocco has made history. Forty-two years ago, Morocco also captured the attention of the world when it became the first Arab and African country to compete in the Eurovision song contest. In the end, it came second to last, and decided never to compete again. Since then, many more Moroccan hearts and egos have been bruised and broken by international football tournaments. The national team have qualified for only five World Cups out of 11 after that Eurovision adventure \u2013 and, at their best, has only ever managed to reach the round of 16. Morocco bid to host the World Cup in 1994, 1998, 2006, 2010 and 2026, and never won. Still, it never gave up hope; football is in the country\u2019s DNA. \u201cIn my life, I will have experienced two historic moments of the utmost importance,\u201d author and Nobel prize nominee Tahar Ben Jelloun wrote this week. \u201cThe return to Morocco of King Mohammed V on November 16, 1956 \u2013 a return that led to the independence of Morocco \u2013 and the qualification, on December 10, 2022, of the Atlas Lions for the semi-finals of the football World Cup.\u201d He sounds dramatic, of course, but wouldn\u2019t you? Morocco has always loved football, it\u2019s part of the country\u2019s history. Abderrahmane Youssoufi, a freedom fighter who eventually became prime minister, recruited young working class men to the cause by setting up a football team and chairing tournaments in Casablanca. Muhammad Zarqtuni, another prominent figure who fought against the French protectorate, met likeminded activists through local leagues in the 1940s. The latter eventually got a boulevard named after him in Casablanca, and would no doubt be pleased to know that it is where supporters have been singing, dancing and celebrating after each game over the past few weeks. It also isn\u2019t hard to guess what he would make of tonight\u2019s game against France.  Still, it will be a more ambiguous night for many of us. There are around a million French-Moroccan people around the world, and many will have spent the past few days torn between their two homes. Asked about her allegiances, author Le\u00efla Slimani said: \u201cI will be supporting Morocco but if France wins, I will be ecstatic too \u2026 But I support Morocco because it is an outsider, because it also represents an entire continent, a region that is often devalued. Suddenly, there is a very positive light on this part of the world.\u201d It would be hard to disagree. Watching pictures of players dancing with their mothers and praying on the pitch has felt like a long needed balm to the soul. When was the last time that Muslim men were cheered on by so many and with such enthusiasm? It is also fair to say that Morocco\u2019s irresistible rise wasn\u2019t exactly expected. Though a few pundits mentioned the team as a potential dark horse, most ignored them, especially given that they shared a group with teams like Belgium and Croatia. Few things are as satisfying as proving doubters wrong, especially after so many decades when they were proved right. As a member of the diaspora, being able to follow the team\u2019s progress has also felt special. Being a second generation immigrant can often be an odd and uncomfortable experience, and there is something joyous about being represented by people with similar lives to yours. I have always felt tremendous guilt at my inability to speak Darija \u2013 the Moroccan Arabic dialect \u2013 with my grandmother, but finding out that the team mostly speaks in English with each other was comforting. After all, it isn\u2019t our fault that our ancestors had itchy feet; that doesn\u2019t mean our hearts cannot belong to several places at once. That is why I will be thinking of London\u2019s Moroccans tonight. Their west London community was ripped apart when Grenfell, once nicknamed \u201cthe Moroccan tower\u201d, burst into flames. Seeing videos of them embracing each other in joy instead of grief after each game has felt overwhelming. I hope they get to pour into the streets again tonight in celebration. On top of everything else, a win tonight would feel well-deserved. Morocco\u2019s success at this World Cup hasn\u2019t been a fluke. As the head coach, Walid Regragui, pointed out earlier this week, the country and its king have long been working to better its performance at the sport. The Mohammed VI Football Academy was launched in 2009 and counts several of the squad\u2019s current players as alumni. This isn\u2019t just a story of bright boys going to train abroad then coming back to reap the benefits, but a triumph of homegrown talent, too. Finally, it has felt like an important moment for the country\u2019s Berber community, which is so often forgotten. Many members of the squad are Amazigh born and bred, and countless Berber Z flags have been spotted in the stadiums of Qatar. Morocco may be Arab and African, but it is Berber too; it is a weird and complex patchwork of languages, cultures and identities, and deserves to be seen as such by the rest of the world. Morocco may not be perfect \u2013 the controversy surrounding the Western Sahara springs to mind \u2013 but everything it has been doing in recent years has felt like a step in the right direction. Here\u2019s hoping this is only the beginning. Now if you\u2019ll excuse me, I need to call my mum before the game. I\u2019ll never be able to bring her on to the pitch for a World Cup game, but I\u2019m hoping that picking her side of the family tonight may be the next best thing.

                    "body": "Adrien Rabiot has warned England not to fixate on stopping Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 and has admitted France are wary of the set-piece threat posed by Gareth Southgate\u2019s side.\nMbapp\u00e9 stepped up his preparations for Saturday\u2019s World Cup quarter-final after returning to full France training on Wednesday following a recovery session indoors on Tuesday.\nRabiot said France must sharpen up at corners to prevent England from prospering when the teams meet at Al Bayt Stadium. England face the world champions hoping to advance to a third straight semi-final at a major tournament and successive semi-finals at a World Cup.\n\nSouthgate has identified set pieces as pivotal to success at tournaments. England scored nine of their 12 goals from set pieces en route to the last four in Russia four years ago and have scored two this campaign. Bukayo Saka\u2019s first goal in England\u2019s 6-2 evisceration of Iran stemmed from a corner and Marcus Rashford scored a free-kick in their 3-0 win over Wales.\nRabiot referenced France\u2019s group-stage win over Denmark, when Andreas Christensen equalised from a corner before Mbapp\u00e9 struck to earn victory, as evidence of their need to be alert.\nHarry Maguire and John Stones are among England\u2019s key threats at set pieces. \u201cI think what can make a big difference will be set pieces,\u201d Rabiot said. \u201cThey are very good at them. We have weapons too but we are going to have to be vigilant and we cannot make the mistakes that we made against Denmark when it was a corner or free-kick because they can be very dangerous.\n\n\u201cI think it will be a very open match. I think they have the same characteristics as us. They have some very fast players on the wing and full-backs that get forward. We are both quite similar, two teams who know how to move forward very fast on the pitch.\u201d\nThe France defender Ibrahima Konat\u00e9 pointedly said that \u201cfootball isn\u2019t played by one or two players, it is played by the whole team\u201d. Mbapp\u00e9 has scored five goals in Qatar and is a strong contender for the Golden Boot.\n\n\u201cWe are not dependent on him,\u201d Rabiot said. \u201cHe has amazing potential and we know that 90% of the goals can maybe come from him. He is very fast, able to make great assists but we also have other players who can make a difference on the pitch in another way. We have a great weapon in Kylian and we\u2019re not going to deprive ourselves of that.\u201d\nThe England right-back Kyle Walker, who is likely to be given the task of nullifying Mbapp\u00e9, said he does not intend to \u201croll out the red carpet\u201d for the in-form Paris Saint-Germain forward. Konat\u00e9 said his Liverpool clubmate and opponent on Saturday Trent Alexander-Arnold has been ribbing him since they were pitted against England. \u201cTrent sent me some teasing texts,\u201d Konat\u00e9 said with a smile.\nThe France centre-back added that just as England would be foolish to obsess about Mbapp\u00e9, Didier Deschamps\u2019 side have no plans to focus on Harry Kane, who took his England tally to 52 goals in their last-16 triumph over Senegal, one short of Wayne Rooney\u2019s England goalscoring record. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to target one particular player,\u201d Konat\u00e9 said. \u201cI\u2019ve played against him a few times but everybody knows Harry Kane is a very good player, a very English player.\u201d\nKonat\u00e9, who was born in Paris to immigrants from Mali, was asked about Morocco becoming the first African team to progress to the World Cup quarter-finals since Ghana in 2010. \u201cIt has been amazing to see the African countries impress the world with their performances,\u201d Konat\u00e9 said. \u201cI\u2019m really happy to know that Morocco are through to the quarter-finals. I am focusing on France because that is the country I have chosen to play for but I hope Morocco do well.\u201d\nRabiot, who had a short spell with Manchester City as a 13-year-old, came close to joining Manchester United earlier this year and said he maintains ambitions of playing in the Premier League. \u201cI really liked the atmosphere [in England],\u201d the Juventus midfielder said. \u201cIt\u2019s really something that\u2019s only in England \u2013 it\u2019s different to France and Italy. I\u2019ve always said that I\u2019d like to play in England and I still have that desire. I would like to evolve in the Premier League.\u201d"

                    "body": "It was a job so comprehensive, so thoroughly performed to the letter, that France\u2019s players converted it to song. \u201cN\u2019Golo Kant\u00e9, he\u2019s short, he\u2019s nice, he shut down Leo Messi but we all know he\u2019s a cheater,\u201d went the lyrics after their midfielder, detailed to smother Argentina\u2019s No 10 in Kazan four years ago, barely allowed him a sniff.\nMessi was given little more than an assist for Sergio Ag\u00fcero\u2019s late consolation; he would finish the afternoon gazing at his feet and suspecting a dream had gone up in smoke, while France sailed through to the quarter-finals and far beyond.\nThe reference to deception? Kant\u00e9\u2019s teammates had a running gag, not entirely based on fiction as he later admitted, that he cheated at cards. But they will need a joker of their own at the World Cup final, because their tried and tested recipe for success is unavailable. This time France have gone all the way without an injured Kant\u00e9 and it has not always been convincing. When Messi, whose last fling at this level has comfortably been his best, awaits at Lusail on Sunday they must find a similarly effective solution.\n\nThat is not lost on France\u2019s players, especially those such as Olivier Giroud, who saw everything close up at that last meeting. Their celebrations upon pulling through against Morocco on Wednesday were, publicly at least, low-key because they knew what lay ahead. Like Argentina, they are a team of moments rather than sustained spells of coherence and control. Someone other than Kant\u00e9 needs to make sure Messi is denied scope to spring his side into life.\n\u201cI remember in 2018, N\u2019Golo was on his back, behind him, all of the game,\u201d said Giroud, showing unprompted recall when the topic came his way. \u201cBut this time I don\u2019t know what the plan will be. We will see with the manager.\u201d\nDidier Deschamps has three days to find one. \u201cHe had a very precise role,\u201d the manager said of Kant\u00e9 after the spoiling job in Tatarstan. \u201cIt is true that we didn\u2019t really see much of Lionel Messi when he played against us.\u201d\nMessi drifts even more freely, more lightly, around the pitch nowadays; he has a habit of standing in seemingly dead space before attracting the play. The ball will find him, that much is certain. The key lies in limiting those moments and denying him oxygen when it comes his way. If it was so easy, everyone would do it.\nSometimes you can put your best defender, and perhaps the tournament\u2019s, in his path and still be pulled apart. Croatia and Josko Gvardiol discovered that on Tuesday. A functioning midfield will give France their best hope, though, and Aur\u00e9lien Tchouam\u00e9ni has admirably bridged the Kant\u00e9-Paul Pogba gap over the past month. A first-half burst through Morocco\u2019s lines, almost resulting in a goal for Giroud or Kylian Mbapp\u00e9, was among their most pulse-raising moments but life was not always easy against slick and mobile opposition.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s both,\u201d Tchouam\u00e9ni said when asked which of the absentees\u2019 roles he occupies. \u201cSometimes it\u2019s to recover some balls and sometimes I have the opportunity to score a goal like the last game [against England], or today with almost-assists. It\u2019s a mix between those. We try to do our best to help the team in the middle of the pitch. I think we\u2019ve done a great job.\u201d\nIf Adrien Rabiot is fit for the final then perhaps Tchouam\u00e9ni will attempt more of a devoted screening job. All the same, Deschamps may prefer to pass the responsibility for Messi around this time rather than allocate one captor. It helps that Antoine Griezmann, much more than a No 10, has been France\u2019s everywhere man. In the 31-year-old they have an advanced, remodelled midfielder who has shown he can slot in to bolster the pair behind while marshalling the space in front. Messi may not be able to drop as deep as he would like to get Argentina moving if Griezmann is snapping away.\n\u201cWe are not going to let him enjoy the best night he can have,\u201d Giroud said. \u201cWe want to win another World Cup. We will try everything to stop him.\u201d It will take knowhow. \nGiroud pointed out that France\u2019s younger players, such as Tchouam\u00e9ni and Tchouam\u00e9ni\u2019s former Monaco teammate Youssouf Fofana, have the benefit of a senior core who know exactly what a winning campaign takes. The older generation set an example from the front. During the first half against Morocco, the veteran centre-forward Giroud trailed the influential holding midfielder Sofyan Amrabat so diligently that his opponent said: \u201cJust stop!\u201d The sense is that a collective effort presents the best hope of nullifying Messi.\n\nBut sometimes, as Kant\u00e9 knows all too well, you can play your cheat card. The 4-3 thriller in 2018 was equally notable as a watershed moment for Mbapp\u00e9, who was unplayable in scoring twice and winning a penalty. It was logical to think the baton of greatness had been handed to the younger man. As it turns out, the Paris Saint-Germain teammates more or less share it now. For all the talk, the best answer to Messi might be a similar exhibition from France\u2019s biggest hope.\nMbapp\u00e9 was asked, as he paced through Al Bayt Stadium\u2019s underbelly, for his thoughts about playing in another final. \u201cReally excited,\u201d was his succinct offering. France must ensure the thrills arise in his realm and not that of the legend he stands to usurp."

                    "body": "Kevin De Bruyne called it right: this ageing Belgium team have no chance of winning the World Cup on the evidence available so far in Qatar. Morocco succeeded where Canada failed in punishing another flat display from the team ranked second in the world, to record their first victory at a World Cup since defeating Scotland in 1998.\nTwo substitutes, Abdelhamid Sabiri and Zakaria Aboukhlal, scored late goals that gave Morocco only their third World Cup win and ignited wild celebrations all around Al Thumama Stadium. The tournament\u2019s latest shock was richly deserved, but not really a shock at all given the paucity of Belgium\u2019s contribution.\nMorocco were incisive and energetic, while Belgium lacked ideas and had lead in their legs, De Bruyne and Eden Hazard especially, while even the usually imperious Thibaut Courtois creaked in the Belgium goal. Roberto Mart\u00ednez\u2019s team can qualify for the last 16 but are a fading shadow of the side that finished third in Russia in 2018.\n\u201cWe played against one of the best teams in the world with big players,\u201d said Morocco\u2019s head coach, Walid Regragui. \u201cAnd we knew that if we didn\u2019t give 100% it would be impossible to win. But with these fans, these players and this spirit we could give the best performance.\u201d\nA stirring rendition of the Moroccan national anthem confirmed the vast majority of the stadium were supporting the north African team.\nMorocco\u2019s every touch was met with impassioned screams; Belgium\u2019s with jeers. Belgium attempted to take the sting out of the crowd by controlling the tempo and dominating possession, 78% of it in the opening 15 minutes. That is one way of describing their performance. Another is that they bored everyone to tears.\n\nMart\u00ednez\u2019s team initially responded to their laboured and lucky win against Canada. The manager reverted to a back four and made three changes including the introduction of Amadou Onana, who was largely responsible for last Wednesday\u2019s modest second-half improvement. They started on the front foot, with Michy Batshuayi forcing a fine early save out of Munir El Kajoui, but mostly it was possession football with no penetration.\nMorocco were forced to change their goalkeeper moments before kick-off when Yassine Bounou told Regragui that \u201che did not feel right\u201d. Bono, as he is more commonly known, lined up for the anthem but was replaced by the time Morocco gathered for the team photo.\n\u201cWith or without you?\u201d Regragui might possibly have asked his first\u2011choice keeper before summonsing El Kajoui. Apologies, it was a dull first half.\n\nHakim Ziyech was hugely influential for a Morocco side whose confidence and sense of adventure increased as the contest developed.\nPinpoint crossfield passes between the Chelsea winger on the right and the former Southampton midfielder Sofiane Boufal on the left opened up Belgium several times. Selim Amallah volleyed over after one such move and the right-back Achraf Hakimi wasted a good opening when blazing wide with the striker Youssef En Nesyri waiting for a cross.\nMorocco believed they had their first goal of the World Cup just before half-time after Ziyech was fouled by Thorgan Hazard. Ziyech took the free-kick and whipped it goalwards. Courtois, unsighted by Romain Sa\u00efss and Hakimi, was deceived by the flight and a touch off Sa\u00efss. The ball squirmed through his grasp and over the line but the Real Madrid keeper\u2019s embarrassment, and the wild Morocco celebrations, were curtailed by VAR. Sa\u00efss\u2019s shoulder was offside.\n\nCourtois would not be spared when Morocco repeated the routine with 17 minutes remaining. After a Thomas Meunier foul on the right, Sabiri drilled a free-kick towards Sa\u00efss, who was moving in at the near post. The central defender, onside this time, pulled his midriff out of the way and Belgium\u2019s goalkeeper was deceived again. The ball flew under his grasp and he would not be spared by VAR on this occasion.\nMorocco\u2019s head coach said: \u201cWe have good free-kick takers and we saw that at his near post Courtois is sometimes overconfident. He is a tall goalkeeper and sometimes he leaves a bit of space at the near post, and that\u2019s what happened.\u201d\nMart\u00ednez had already made several substitutions in an attempt to inject an end product into Belgium\u2019s display. They did not succeed, although El Kajoui saved from Eden Hazard, Dries Mertens and Batshuayi.\nPanic was rising in the stands as Five minutes of stoppage time were signalled. It turned to pandemonium when Ziyech escaped down the right and pulled the ball back for Aboukhlal who, allowed too much space inside the area by Axel Witsel, swept a superb finish in to the top corner. \u201cWe have four points after playing two of the best teams in the world and that is absolutely extraordinary for Morocco,\u201d said Regragui. \u201cBut I\u2019m not happy with four points. I want more.\u201d"

                    "body": "How do you stop someone who seems to have capabilities that are beyond human? That is the question that no player or team that has gone up against Lionel Messi at this World Cup has been able to answer. Next in line to try to stop the unstoppable and end Messi\u2019s hunt for the missing piece of his trophy puzzle will be the Netherlands on Friday evening.\nAt 35 years old this is potentially the Argentinian\u2019s final World Cup and he is thriving. Thriving off the responsibility and expectation, almost as if the fact that this could be his last chance has lifted the pressure that comes with all that. \nI was a centre-back for England and played domestically in England, Sweden and the US. Occasionally, you come up against players who just strike fear into you. For me, there were a few but the Brazilian forward and six-time Fifa world player of the year Marta stands out. She was, and is, similar to Messi. She had that characteristic close-ball control with added trickery, using all parts of her foot to control and dribble and roll and change direction. As a defender it was always hard to try to keep her in one direction and force her away from dangerous areas. The Arsenal forward Vivianne Miedema is probably the modern\u2011day equivalent that I faced in the women\u2019s game.\n\nShe reads where and when players drop their weight with the same speed and intelligence. She waits for you to commit yourself and if you drop a shoulder or you angle your body to take control of the situation, she\u2019ll either feint you or go around you. In situations where you expect her to take a shot early, often she doesn\u2019t, instead she puts you on the floor, goes again and then creates a clearer scoring opportunity for herself. I can only imagine what stepping out opposite Messi must feel like.\nIt\u2019s almost like he has a gravitational pull and he himself has a gravitational force, pulling and twisting and managing the movement of the ball like it\u2019s a part of his orbit. He has such a continuity in his movement when he\u2019s on the ball, when he\u2019s dribbling with that close-ball control with such effortless grace. His first touch, which is nearly always sublime, means he doesn\u2019t ever give you an inch of space. Often as a defender you\u2019re counting on putting pressure on at the first touch, if it\u2019s a poor touch you have a chance of stopping them. However his first touch is often so good that defenders are stopped dead in their tracks, and he\u2019s able to just skip by them.\nOne of the only ways to defend against Messi is to do it in numbers. I would want to pull in the defenders around me, drag my wing-back in, have my centre-back close to me, maybe my deep-lying central midfielder offering support and focus on trying to get in the way of those passing lines that he so often finds. But the problem is that he also thrives in those situations. He sucks players towards him. He wants three or four players swarming him with pressure and when that happens he finds the pass. He knows where the space is, he knows where his spare man is, and he\u2019ll find him. If it\u2019s not that, he\u2019s drawing the foul and then we all know what he can do with a free-kick.\n\nThe alternative is being exposed to Messi one v one and that\u2019s only really going to end one way. When you see him approaching, you often see defenders almost shift onto their tiptoes, waiting to see what direction he\u2019s going, and none of them want to dive in because he\u2019s also a nutmeg master. The minute you get half a step towards him he\u2019s putting the ball through your legs or putting it around and you running around to collect. It\u2019s over before you\u2019ve had time to even try and guess and it looks a humiliation. But how can you be humiliated? It\u2019s Messi. That\u2019s his bread and butter. He makes the best defenders in the world look average time and time again.\nA lot of what is special about him is enhanced by his low centre of gravity. That helps his agility, his ability to read where players drop their weight and to utilise his momentum to shift from dribbling slow, sucking players in, to then speeding it up. He does that with an unrivalled fluidity, he doesn\u2019t have to stop and push again, he can just keep going and ramp it up. It\u2019s hard to stop someone with that level of momentum coming towards you. You end up getting pulled into positions you don\u2019t want to be in and doing things that are uncharacteristic.\n\nNot enough is said about the vision of players such as Messi off the ball too. Lots of people talk about scanning, but not everyone does it and not everyone does it effectively. The best players in the world do it the most often. Messi is the sort of player who is constantly looking over his shoulder, analysing where he can pick up those little pockets of space between players, in between units, and the smallest of spaces is all he needs to operate in, which is wild.\nWhat is perhaps most exhilarating about watching him in this tournament is that he is in form but also that he looks like he is thoroughly enjoying this potential last ride. If Argentina win the World Cup? Well, what a way to cap off the huge joy we\u2019ve all had witnessing him play."

                    "body": "Jude Bellingham was only 14 when England began their last World Cup campaign but he was already planning for the future. \u201cEven watching that I was only ever thinking: \u2018How can I get into this team?\u2019\u201d the midfielder said last week.\nFour-and-a-half years on and the 19\u2011year\u2011old scored his first senior international goal on the biggest stage as Gareth Southgate\u2019s side kicked off their 2022 World Cup campaign in style. The 6-2 thumping of Iran in which the 21-year-old Bukayo Saka scored two brilliant goals showed that England\u2019s emerging generation are determined to do things their own way.\n\u201cI feel the support and love from the fans, the coaching staff and my teammates,\u201d Saka said after \u2013 like his fellow goalscorer Marcus Rashford, who came on as a substitute \u2013 he banished the demons of missing a penalty in the Euro 2020 final on his previous appearance at a major tournament. \u201cThat is all I need.\u201d\n\nBellingham\u2019s opener, which made him the second teenager to score for England at a World Cup after Michael Owen\u2019s heroics as an 18\u2011year\u2011old in 1998, has been long in the making. Ever since he first played for Birmingham\u2019s under\u201118s just as England were heading to Russia in 2018, the son of a prolific non-league striker, Mark \u2013 who also served as a sergeant for West Midlands Police \u2013 has been tipped for stardom.\nAfter beating Trevor Francis\u2019s longstanding record as Birmingham\u2019s youngest player by 101 days, Bellingham opted to remain in the Championship for another season despite interest from most of Europe\u2019s top clubs. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot of success for the club and the academy,\u201d said former manager Pep Clotet after his protege scored the winning goal against Charlton in September 2019. \u201cFor the fans to see a young player coming through \u2013 that is something you can never buy in football.\u201d\nUnlike Saka, Mason Mount, Declan Rice or any of the other players in Southgate\u2019s squad who have blossomed after being nurtured in the thriving English academy system, Bellingham has left his homeland. He joined Borussia Dortmund in the summer of 2020, following in the footsteps of Jadon Sancho, who had turned down a contract with Manchester City to move to Germany in 2017. It was Dortmund\u2019s attention to detail that attracted Bellingham and his father.\n\n\u201cThere is a person there for every player, especially Otto [Addo], who has worked with the young players,\u201d Bellingham said in 2020 of the man who is also Ghana\u2019s coach at this World Cup. \u201cHe is great. Everyone has that support system to work for their chance in the first team. The way they integrate young players into the first-team squad is next level. There is not a club in Europe that does it quite like them.\u201d\nBellingham this season became the only English teenager to have scored in four consecutive Champions League games, and Pep Guardiola suggested last month that the player might not have been given the same opportunities in England. \u201cMaybe he would not get the minutes,\u201d the Manchester City manager said. \u201cThe best thing for a young player to be better is to play minutes.\u201d\nBut after Southgate expressed fears in 2019 that only 15% of players in the Premier League could be eligible for England in a decade unless clubs gave more opportunities to homegrown players, last season more than 40% qualified \u2013 the highest since 2005. With an average age of 26.4 years, England have the eighth-youngest squad in Qatar and second-youngest of the European countries, behind Spain.\nSaka joined Arsenal when he was seven and became the first player born in the 21st century to play in the Premier League when he made his debut in January 2019. His development under first Unai Emery then Mikel Arteta is testament to the importance they have placed in youth in recent years. Of those who came through the academy at the same time as Saka, Joe Willock, Josh Dasilva, Emile Smith Rowe, Reiss Nelson and Eddie Nketiah have played in the Premier League this season.\n\nIt is similar at Chelsea, where Mount and Conor Gallagher joined at a young age and there were six English players in their starting lineup against Leicester in August, including five academy graduates.\n\u201cOur preference is to look at some really exciting young ones who\u2019ve proved at youth level that they\u2019re as good anything around the world,\u201d Southgate said when he called up Mount, Sancho and a 22-year-old James Maddison in October 2018 \u2013 perhaps not coincidentally also the day he extended his contract until this World Cup. \u201cThat should give us confidence that with the right development and the right opportunity, they can translate that into the senior team.\u201d"

Thanks for reading this Clockwatch, and hope to see you tomorrow for the Carabao Cup clash between Manchester United and Burnley. Nighty night!      10.09pm    Ed Aarons was at Stadium MK. This is his report on a good evening for Brendan Rodgers, who continues to turn Leicester\u2019s season around.      10.08pm    Louise Taylor was at St James\u2019 Park. Here\u2019s her take on another positive step forward for Eddie Howe.      10.07pm    Ben Fisher was at Molineux tonight. Here\u2019s his report of a winning start for Julen Lopetegui.      10.06pm   The full-time scores  Carabao Cup  Milton Keynes Dons 0-3 Leicester City Newcastle United 1-0 Bournemouth Southampton 2-1 Lincoln City Wolverhampton Wanderers 2-0 Gillingham  Scottish Premiership  Aberdeen 2-3 Rangers      10.04pm    That was proper Devon Loch behaviour from Aberdeen. They had the winning post in sight, only for Roos, Stewart and Richardson to make elementary mistakes deep into injury time that allowed Scott Arfield to slam home twice from close range! Hats off to Rangers for keeping going, and their late, late, late, late, late show keeps them hanging onto Celtic\u2019s coat-tails by the fingernails. The title race not quite kaput yet, even if Ange Postecoglou\u2019s side remain firmly in control of it. A breathing space for Michael Beale to work with. A sickener for Aberdeen, though. They lost late here to Celtic at the weekend, which was bad enough, but this one will really hurt.      10.00pm   FULL TIME: Aberdeen 2-3 Rangers  Aberdeen were this close to their first win at Pittodrie over Rangers since 2016 \u2026 and now look! What an astonishing end to the match! It\u2019s not quite up there with the World Cup final in terms of jaw-dropping drama, but domestic football is back, baby!  Updated at 10.00pm GMT    9.58pm   GOAL! Aberdeen 2-3 Rangers (Arfield 90 +7)  Tilman worms his way down the right and dinks to the far stick. Stewart and Richardson get in each other\u2019s way as they try to head clear under pressure from Morelos. The ball drops to Goldson, who tries to control with his chest, but can\u2019t. The ball breaks to Goldson\u2019s right, where Arfield is on hand to bash home again! What drama here!   Updated at 10.25pm GMT    9.56pm    90 min +6: That equaliser has sucked the air out of Pittodrie. The fans gutted. But the team haven\u2019t given up. A free kick launched into the Rangers mixer. The ball breaks to Ramadani, who fires a sensational low drive inches wide of the left-hand post from 25 yards. Had that been on target, there was no way McGregor was getting there. And what drama here, because \u2026     9.55pm   GOAL! Aberdeen 2-2 Rangers (Arfield 90+5)  Kent is allowed to cut in from the right and pearl a shot goalwards from the edge of the D. Roos parries but spills on the line. Arfield reacts quicker than anyone in red, and slams home the loose ball from six yards!   Updated at 10.03pm GMT    9.53pm    90 min +3: Tavernier clumsily clatters Scales as Rangers attempt to pin Aberdeen back, and Aberdeen are gifted an opportunity to run down the clock.     9.52pm    90 min +2: There will be seven added minutes, incidentally.     9.52pm    90 min +1: Make that nine, as Watkins \u2013 who scored in Inverness Caley Thistle\u2019s 2015 Scottish Cup final victory - is cautioned for delaying the restart as McGregor tries to take a free kick. No reds, though, which for this fixture is saying something.     9.50pm    90 min: Arfield becomes the eighth player to go into the referee\u2019s notebook tonight.      9.49pm    89 min: The scorer of the winner the last time Aberdeen beat Rangers in the league at Pittodrie? James Maddison, back in 2016.     9.48pm    87 min: Rangers continue to achieve nothing. The home fans are giving it plenty.     9.45pm    85 min: Aberdeen seem happy to sit back and let Rangers have the ball. No wonder. The visitors are doing precious little with it.     9.44pm    To the last knockings at Pittodrie, then. Seven minutes plus stoppages to go, with Aberdeen leading 2-1. Rangers need a couple of goals to keep their title hopes in any sort of realistic shape, and even then you wouldn\u2019t back them to hunt down leaders Celtic unless Bealeball kicks in quicksmart. But here we go.     9.42pm   FULL TIME: Newcastle 1-0 Bournemouth  The scoreline flatters Bournemouth. Newcastle were utterly dominant, and ease through to the last four.     9.40pm   FULL TIME: Southampton 2-1 Lincoln  Saints should have won by more: Edozie misses an open goal from six yards, then Adams over-elaborates when looking for his hat-trick, with team-mates either side waiting to be teed up for a tap-in. Farcical finishing, but Saints survive and go through to the quarters.     9.38pm   FULL TIME: Wolves 2-0 Gillingham  A winning start for Julen Lopetegui, though Wolves\u2019 new manager doesn\u2019t look particularly happy with his team as he sulks off down the tunnel. Never mind, Wolves are in the last eight!     9.36pm   FULL TIME: MK Dons 0-3 Leicester  Never in doubt. Leicester are the first team into the quarters. The MK Dons can concentrate on their League One relegation battle.     9.34pm   GOAL! Wolves 2-0 Gillingham (Ait-Nouri 90+1)  It\u2019s all over bar the shouting at Molineux. The Gills pile forward in the hope of forcing a penalty shoot-out, but they\u2019re caught on the break and Ait-Nouri sends a forensic diagonal daisycutter into the bottom right from just inside the box.   Updated at 9.46pm GMT    9.33pm    It very nearly threatens to spill over at Pittodrie. Lundstrum is in the middle of it, having blootered the ball into the prone Watkins, a needlessly aggressive and provocative act. Just a yellow, which is fairly lenient. Richardson also makes his way into the book for his role in the resulting stramash.     9.26pm    Rangers haven\u2019t done a whole lot since falling behind. In the dugout, Michael Beale quietly fumes as he surveys the signal lack of light-blue action on the pitch.     9.22pm   GOAL! Wolves 1-0 Gillingham (Jimenez 77 pen)  The dam finally bursts at Molineux. A corner is swung into the Gillingham box from the right. Hwang is bundled over and the referee points to the spot. Jimenez rolls cutely into the bottom right, having surely studied all those cheeky efforts during the World Cup finals.   Updated at 9.37pm GMT    9.20pm   GOAL! Southampton 2-1 Lincoln (Adams 74)  Walcott works his way down the right and crosses deep. Elyounoussi attempts a spectacular scissor kick towards the bottom right. It\u2019s cleared off the line, but Adams is on point to bundle the rebound home. Fine team goal!   Updated at 9.41pm GMT    9.16pm   GOAL! Aberdeen 2-1 Rangers (Clarkson 53)  Aberdeen haven\u2019t beaten Rangers in 13 attempts, but they\u2019re on their way tonight at Pittodrie! Clarkson takes a touch to control a loose ball on the edge of the Rangers D, and whistles a wonderful shot into the bottom right, McGregor given no chance. Pittodrie erupts!    Updated at 9.33pm GMT    9.14pm   GOAL! Newcastle 1-0 Bournemouth (Smith og 67)  Trippier romps down the right touchline. He whips long. Wilson competes aerially six yards out, his presence forcing Smith to loop a header into his own net. Right into the top right. Senesi tries in vain to hook clear off the line but can\u2019t manage it. The Toon take one tiny step closer to their first major domestic trophy since 1955!    Updated at 9.26pm GMT    9.11pm    Wolves come close again against Gillingham. Traore speeds his way down the right and whips into the mixer for Costa, who opens his body and sidefoots a powerful volley inches wide of the right-hand post.     9.10pm    They\u2019re underway at Pittodrie again. Aberdeen are looking to come from behind to beat Rangers for the first time since 1988, the days of Alex McLeish, Willie Miller, Jim Bett and Charlie Nicholas. That\u2019s some run they\u2019d snap.     9.07pm    It\u2019s been all Newcastle at St James\u2019 Park, so naturally it\u2019s Bournemouth who nearly take the lead early in the second half. Smith powers his way down the right and digs out a fine cross from a tight spot. Moore, steaming in from the left, meets it with a fine diving header. His effort flashes inches wide of the bottom right. Had that been on target, it would have registered at least eight out of ten on the Houchen-Gvardiol-o-meter.     9.02pm    A lull all over the land. \u201cSo, I\u2019m watching the Newcastle-Bournemouth match on ESPN+,\u201d begins Joe Pearson. \u201cHalf-time comes and I think I\u2019ll check out the Guardian. What\u2019s this, a Clockwatch? Take a day off, man!\u201d Hey, soccer never stops. You\u2019ll join me on the MBM for Manchester United v Burnley tomorrow night, right?     8.54pm   GOAL! MK Dons 0-3 Leicester (Vardy 50)  Castagne makes his way down the right and reaches the byline before dinking back for Vardy, who steers a header across Cumming and into the bottom left. The 1964, 1997 and 2000 winners are strolling towards the quarter-finals.    Updated at 9.34pm GMT    8.53pm    The second-half action in the League Cup is underway. The World Cup final finished just 51 hours ago.     8.50pm   Scottish Premiership half-time   Aberdeen 1-1 Rangers  As things stand, the top of the Scottish Premiership looks like this \u2026      8.47pm   GOAL! Aberdeen 1-1 Rangers (Duk 45)  What a goal this is! Duk, to the right of the D, loops the free kick over the wall and curls it into the top left! McGregor had taken a step to his left, perhaps unsure that the three-man Rangers wall, set to guard the other side of the goal, was good enough. That opened the door for Duk, who took full advantage!   Updated at 9.43pm GMT    8.44pm    \u2026 so having said that, Sands goes into the book for a really cynical trip on Miovski, just to the right of the Rangers D. Aberdeen were putting together a promising attack there. Five bookings in this match already, if you\u2019ll allow be to further belabour the point. Anyway, this free kick gives Aberdeen a good opportunity to work McGregor in the Rangers goal. A very dangerous position.     8.41pm    Rangers are looking the more likely to score the next goal at Pittodrie. Kent tees up Sakala, who sends a dipping shot screaming inches over the bar from 25 yards. Not sure Roos was getting to it had it been on target.     8.38pm    Another Aberdonian yellow card. This time it goes to Barron, for a fairly basic tackle on Sands. The odds of an eighth red card in nine games between Aberdeen and Rangers at Pittodrie further shorten.     8.36pm   Carabao Cup half-times   Milton Keynes Dons 0-2 Leicester City Newcastle United 0-0 Bournemouth Southampton 1-1 Lincoln City Wolverhampton Wanderers 0-0 Gillingham  A reminder that we\u2019ll go straight to penalty kicks if any game ends in a draw.     8.34pm    At St James\u2019 Park, a low cross rolls through the Bournemouth six-yard box from the left. All Almiron has to do is tap home from six yards, but somehow duffs the connection, the ball barely moving forward before spinning back sadly and getting hoofed away. Meanwhile Wolves go close to taking the lead against Gillingham at Molineux, Hodge sending a header wide from six yards, Neves then cracking a curler off the right-hand upright from the edge of the D. Both games remain goalless.     8.28pm    Incidentally, Jack and Ramadani were recently involved in a full and frank exchange of views, and both have found themselves in the referee\u2019s notebook as a result. Scales has also been yellow carded after going in hard on Morelos. There have been seven reds in the last eight stagings of this particular fixture, incidentally. Like we say, no love lost.     8.26pm    Aberdeen come close to equalising twice in a couple of minutes. First Duk makes a nuisance of himself on the left-hand corner of the Rangers six-yard box, the ball twanging off the post, then ruffling the side netting. A claim that Tavernier had handled, but nothing doing. Then Duk makes good down the left and finds Ramadani in acres just inside the box on the right. Ramadani only has McGregor to beat, but drags his shot wide right. A fine response to falling behind from the Dons.  Updated at 8.47pm GMT    8.22pm    Wilson has a goal chalked off for offside at St James\u2019 Park. VAR has probably done Bournemouth a solid here, as while Wilson was sweeping into the bottom right from 12 yards, the flag went up with Willock prone nearby. Not sure Willock touched that, nor was he interfering with play. He might not even have been offside, with Almiron the only player stranded, and he was miles away from the action. A fair chance VAR would have unpacked all of that in Newcastle\u2019s favour, but it\u2019s still goalless.     8.20pm   GOAL! MK Dons 0-2 Leicester (Perez 29)  Leicester double their lead with a lovely goal. Thomas creams a long pass down the inside-left channel. Perez takes it down with a silky touch, sending Tucker off to the tuck shop, and threading forensically into the bottom left. That\u2019s delicious!   Updated at 8.39pm GMT    8.18pm    There was a small pause as VAR checked whether the ball brushed Sakala\u2019s arm. But it clearly came off his chest. And Aberdeen are rattled, allowing Morelos another chance from ten yards. His drive is straight at Roos, who parries well.      8.16pm   GOAL! Aberdeen 0-1 Rangers (Sakala 12)  Rangers score first for once! Morelos bustles down the right and into the box. He crosses. Sakala takes a swipe at the ball, not in a particularly progressive fashion. Up onto his own chest and away. Stewart tries to clear but makes a hash of it. Sakala doesn\u2019t turn down a second chance, poking home the rebound.    Updated at 8.38pm GMT    8.13pm   GOAL! Southampton 1-1 Lincoln (Adams 25)  Saints are back on terms at St Mary\u2019s, and it\u2019s a controversial one. Elyounoussi spins and sends a lovely looping cross into the Lincoln box from the right wing. Adams is alone on the penalty spot, and steers a header into the top right. He doesn\u2019t celebrate much, and looks a bit sheepish. He looked a smidgen offside. But there\u2019s no VAR, and the goal\u2019s given!   Updated at 8.21pm GMT    8.10pm    Post-Mondial Existential Angst with Adam Kline-Schoder. \u201cPlease help me: is this real? How is it possible that I\u2019m already back watching Southampton losing? I feel like it was simultaneously six years ago and five minutes ago that I was watching them throw away yet another two-goal lead, and yet here we are, 64 games and a different men\u2019s world champion later. How do we resume normal life after That Final?\u201d     8.06pm   GOAL! MK Dons 0-1 Leicester (Tielemans 18)  A lovely goal for the Foxes at the MK Dons. Barnes races down the left wing and fires in a low cross. Vardy tries to flick the ball home from six yards, a decent first-time effort that\u2019s parried by Cumming in the MK goal. The ball breaks to Tielemans, who drives the rebound home from the penalty spot.   Updated at 8.10pm GMT    8.01pm    Aberdeen and Rangers take to the pitch at Pittodrie. Always a fair chance of this fixture descending into an outrageous donnybrook. No love lost. They\u2019ll be kicking off in a minute.     7.57pm    Actually, looking at a replay of the Lincoln goal, it does look as though Bazunu beat O\u2019Connor to the ball, only for his weak punch to sail apologetically into the top-left corner. Lincoln continue to be on top as they look to double their lead. The slowest of slow start for Nathan Jones at his new manor.     7.54pm    Otherwise, a quiet start to the evening. This Clockwatch was never going to be an energy piece. Then again, the World Cup final took the best part of 80 minutes to really get going, and look how that ended.  Updated at 7.54pm GMT    7.50pm   GOAL! Southampton 0-1 Lincoln (Bazunu 2 og)  A shock start at St Mary\u2019s! A Lincoln corner sent in from the left. Maitland-Niles takes a wild swipe at the ball in his attempt to clear it. The ball balloons miles into the sky and back towards his own goal. On the line, Bazunu goes up with O\u2019Connor, who may or not win the header that forces the ball over the line. The keeper\u2019s been awarded the own goal, for now.   Updated at 7.57pm GMT    7.46pm    The League Cup matches are kicking off in Milton Keynes, Southampton, Newcastle and Wolverhampton. Action soon! Action hopefully soon!     7.28pm    Julen Lopetegui takes charge of Wolves for the first time. He names a strong side including Diego Costa and Daniel Podence, plus, returning from the World Cup, Jose Sa and Ruben Neves. Raul Jimenez and Hwang Hee-chan are also back from Qatar, but will start on the bench. Gillingham make three changes from their last match, an FA Cup win over Dagenham &amp; Redbridge in early December. Stuart O\u2019Keefe, Cheye Alexander and Mikael Mandron all step up.     7.24pm    Southampton are able to select Kyle Walker-Peters for the first time in two months as the right-back returns from a hamstring injury. He\u2019s one of three players recalled by Nathan Jones following the 3-1 Premier League defeat at Liverpool, along with Lyanco and Ainsley Maitland-Niles. Armel Bella-Kotchap and Mohammed Salisu also start after their World Cup exploits. Lincoln make two changes from the goalless draw at Wycombe a couple of weekends ago. Defender Sean Roughan and midfielder Daniel Mandroiu replace Jamie Robson and Jack Diamond.     7.21pm    All five of Newcastle\u2019s returning World Cup stars get straight back to work at the day job. Nick Pope, Kieran Trippier, Fabian Schar, Bruno Guimaraes and Callum Wilson all start, as Eddie Howe makes just one change to the side that beat Chelsea before the Premier League power-down: Chris Wood is replaced by Wilson. Bournemouth welcome back Wales internationals Chris Mepham and Kieffer Moore to domestic duty. Mepham is one of three changes to the side that beat Everton 3-0 in the Premier League: he, Ryan Christie and Jaidon Anthony replace Jack Stephens, Jefferson Lerma and Marcus Tavernier.     7.17pm    The managerless MK Dons make two changes from the side that beat Portsmouth last weekend, their first League One win in nearly a month. Will Grigg and Dawson Devoy replace Nathan Holland and Bradley Johnson, the latter assuming caretaker-to-the-caretaker duties with actual interim boss Dean Lewington away getting surgery on a hamstring problem. Leicester welcome back Danny Ward, Wout Faes, Timothy Castagne, Youri Tielemans and Daniel Amartey from World Cup duty. James Maddison, who didn\u2019t get any game time with England in Qatar, won\u2019t be back until the Boxing Day game with Newcastle United.     7.03pm   Carabao Cup team news  Milton Keynes Dons: Cumming, Tucker, O\u2019Hora, Jules, Watson, McEachran, Devoy, Harvie, Eisa, Grant, Grigg.Subs: Smith, Robson, Holland, Oyegoke, Kemp, Barry, Lawrence, Ravizzoli, Dennis.Leicester City: Ward, Castagne, Amartey, Faes, Thomas, Soumare, Perez, Tielemans, Praet, Barnes, Vardy.Subs: Albrighton, Iheanacho, Daka, Vestergaard, Mendy, Ndidi, Iversen, McAteer, Alves.

                    "body": "ITV World Cup pundit Nadia Nadim has revealed she had to leave the studio while on air after learning that her mother had died. The Denmark international footballer wrote on Instagram that her mother, Hadima Nadim, 57, had been killed in a collision with a truck on her way home from the gym on Tuesday. The 34-year-old was part of ITV\u2019s coverage of Denmark\u2019s 0-0 draw with Tunisia in Qatar but had to leave the studio before the final whistle. Nadim, her four sisters and their mother fled Afghanistan when she was 11, having been in hiding for three years after her father Rabani, an army general, was executed by the Taliban in 2000. The former Manchester City and Paris Saint-Germain forward wrote: \u201cTuesday morning my Mother was killed by a truck. She was on her way back from the gym. \u201cWords cannot describe what I\u2019m feeling. I have lost the most important person in my life and it happened so sudden and unexpected. \u201cShe was only 57. She was a warrior who had fought for every inch of her life. \u201cShe didn\u2019t give me life once but twice, and everything I/we are is because of her. \u201cI have lost my home and I know nothing\u2019s gonna ever feel the same. Life is unfair and I don\u2019t understand why her and why this way. I love you and I will see you again.\u201d Nadim, who plays for National Women\u2019s Soccer League club Racing Louisville FC in the US, added: \u201cHer funeral is going to be soon \u2026 please come and show her the love, respect and prayers she deserves.\u201d After Nadim\u2019s father\u2019s death, Nadim\u2019s mother sold all of their possessions to take a minivan to Karachi, southern Pakistan, where they waited two months for fake passports before taking a flight to Italy. The family spent days hiding in a basement in Milan, then 50 hours in the back of a truck to reach what they were told was London, but turned out to be a refugee camp in rural Denmark, where Nadim discovered her love for playing football."

                    "body": "Many TV viewers in France awoke to a shock on Thursday morning, belatedly discovering that the world champions had lost 1-0 Tunisia having turned off thinking that Antoine Griezmann had levelled the game. The broadcaster TF1 cut to an advert break after Griezmann\u2019s shot deep into stoppage time crossed the line, believing the final whistle had sounded in the aftermath, and prompting millions of viewers to switch off.\nInstead the referee, Matthew Conger, was belatedly called to consult the pitchside monitor by VAR and contentiously ruled out the late strike because of Griezmann\u2019s offside position earlier in play. But TF1 had left its audience with footage of France celebrations and Tunisian heartbreak, continuing tournament coverage with its World Cup Mag show rather than returning to the stadium.\nUltimately, the 1-0 defeat did not change much because France still finished top of Group D and a Tunisia victory was not enough for the north African side to overtake Australia in second place. However a much-changed France losing their unbeaten record in Qatar still came as a surprise to many fans.\n\nTF1 issued an apology for its hasty exit on social media, and on the Mag show the journalist Gr\u00e9goire Margotton explained the channel\u2019s error to the viewers that remained. \u201cWe were convinced that it was over, everyone was going back to the locker room,\u201d Margotton said. \u201cIt took a long, long time and Mr Conger, the New Zealand referee, went to consult the VAR. He was told after a very long time that there was an offside by Antoine Griezmann and that goal was therefore disallowed.\u201d\nHowever this may not be the end of the story, with the French Football Federation saying it is ready to file a complaint to Fifa on the grounds that the last-gasp equaliser had been incorrectly ruled out.\n\nThe FFF said in a statement: \u201cWe are writing a complaint after Antoine Griezmann\u2019s goal was, in our opinion, wrongly disallowed. This complaint has to be filed within 24 hours after the final whistle.\u201d\nThe FFF did not elaborate on its complaint, but there are two points of contention. Griezmann was clearly offside when Aur\u00e9lien Tchouam\u00e9ni crossed but latched on to ball only after the Tunisia defender Montassar Talbi\u2019s attempted clearance, by which point he was onside. Also the game had restarted from kick-off, with the referee then appearing to blow for full time, before Conger went to review the footage. Ifab, football\u2019s law-making body, states that if a game has been restarted after a goal is given VAR cannot intervene, so there was an error in procedure.\nFrance salvaging a 1-1 draw would not have changed the group standings, with Tunisia still finishing third and the world champions top and facing Poland in the last 16.

                    "body": "England are optimistic that Harry Kane will be available for the game against the USA on Friday night after he took part in training on Wednesday. The captain sparked alarm when he had a scan on his right ankle after hurting it during the 6-2 win against Iran on Monday.\nKane was caught by a bad tackle from Morteza Pouraliganji in the 48th minute, although he did play on until the 75th minute. There is now a confidence within the camp that, despite the precautionary scan, Kane will be able to play.\nThe England goalkeeper Jordan Pickford said: \u201cI think Harry is good, probably just a little bit sore. I\u2019m sure he is fine. He was out on the grass with us today, which is good. He is our captain.\u201d\n\nThe condition of Kane\u2019s ankles has been a part of his story, particularly between 2016 and 2019 when he endured five layoffs with ligament damage \u2013 the first three on the right foot, the second two on the left.\nSince April 2019 he sustained much less serious problems with his ankles on two occasions, when sprains briefly ruled him out in February 2021 and then in April of the same year.\nKane has credited the work he has done more recently with a private physiotherapist in making him more resilient.\nJames Maddison, who is carrying a knee injury, again did not train with the squad on Wednesday, making him a doubt for the USA game.\nPickford has urged England, who have kept only two clean sheets in 2022, to defend with more focus against the USA. He did not hide his anger when Iran put two late goals past him and echoed Southgate\u2019s warning about the importance of keeping concentration levels high.\n\u201cAs a whole squad we want to keep clean sheets because we know how important they are through tournament football,\u201d Pickford said.\n\u201cWe were 4-0 up and conceded an easy goal really. They got a penalty which was a bit of an indifferent one. You\u2019re never going to be happy conceding a goal and we will build on to USA and hopefully get a clean sheet.\u201d\nPickford, who excelled during the 2018 World Cup and Euro 2020, praised Harry Maguire\u2019s performance against Iran. He argued that the defender, who has struggled for Manchester United this season, has received too much criticism for indifferent club performances.\n\u201cWe have a great relationship,\u201d Pickford said. \u201cThe majority of my caps have been with Harry playing in front of me and we work really well together. Our defensive record with Harry playing there is really good as well and he is in a very good moment.\n\u201cHe needs to be respected a lot more but part of being a footballer is being criticised. Everyone gets criticised in football. But Harry is mentally strong and takes it really well. I think it\u2019s a bit unfair but his performances on the pitch show why he has so many caps for England and is captain of Man United.\u201d\nPickford addressed the VAR decision that led to John Stones giving away a penalty against Iran for a slight tug of Pouraliganji\u2019s shirt. \u201cI\u2019ve not looked at it back but it was meant to be a soft decision. If we have to address it as a squad defensively and see what is happening in the other matches decision-wise, we will have to take a bit more focus on it with a decision like that getting given.\u201d"

                    "body": "Farewell Samurai Blue. Japan have enriched the World Cup with stunning comebacks against old champions, indefatigable spirit and a passionate desire to upset the football hierarchy, but the formidable weight of history proved too great in Qatar. Their own, and Croatia\u2019s.\nHistory repeated itself in this last\u201116 tie as Croatia prevailed in a penalty shootout after extra time. As they do. Six of their past seven knockout games at major tournaments have lasted 120 minutes, with the exception of defeat against France in the 2018 World Cup final, and the smallest country left in the competition are defying the odds yet again. Japan exited agonisingly short of a first ever quarter-final appearance. As they do.\nFour times Japan have reached the last 16 and four times they have tasted defeat, twice on penalties. Hajime Moriyasu\u2019s team were showered with praise after defeating Germany and Spain to top a difficult group but, facing their own fans and a chance to break new ground in the shootout, they froze.\n\nThe goalkeeper Dominik Livakovic was the Croatia hero with three saves from Takumi Minamino, Kaoru Mitoma and the captain, Maya Yoshida, each penalty struck low and without conviction. Moriyasu and his Croatia counterpart Zlatko Dalic understandably singled out the Dinamo Zagreb keeper as the contest\u2019s defining influence but Livakovic put it best himself. \u201cI don\u2019t think these penalties were too difficult to defend,\u201d he admitted. \u201cThey shot in a strange manner. These were not perfect penalties.\u201d\nJapan\u2019s spot-kicks were as tame as the preceding 120 minutes. The game itself was a monumental letdown before the Croatia substitute Mario Pasalic sent his country into the quarter-finals with the decisive penalty. The veteran defender Yuto Nagatomo had evoked the spirit of the Samurai on the eve of the game, promising bravery and a never\u2011say\u2011die attitude from Japan. But this was less warrior, more hypnotherapist treating an insomniac. Incense burning in the corner.\n\nThe game had penalties written all over it long before the painful reality arrived for Japan. Moriyasu\u2019s team merited their half-time lead on account of sharper distribution, movement and intelligent set pieces, although it was a low\u2011quality affair throughout. There was a subdued atmosphere in the stands where thousands of seats remained empty in the 44,325-capacity arena and 42,523 was given as the official attendance. Not a chance.\nThere was a sluggish first\u2011half performance from Croatia too with Dalic\u2019s players showing signs of tiredness in their fourth game of the tournament. Their dulled edges allowed Japan to avoid punishment for several defensive errors.\n\nSamurai Blue took the game to Croatia initially. Shogo Taniguchi sent a glancing header wide from a well\u2011worked short corner involving Junya Ito and Wataru Endo. Ito frequently beat Borna Barisic for pace and his deliveries from the right unsettled the Croatia defence. Daizen Maeda and Nagatomo both just failed to connect with one inviting cross along the face of goal. Daichi Kamada squandered another decent opportunity, slicing over after Hidemasa Morita, Maeda and Endo had combined impressively to release him inside the Croatia area.\nCroatia\u2019s brightest first\u2011half moments stemmed from Japanese errors rather than their gifted midfield of Luka Modric, Mateo Kovacic and Marcelo Brozovic. Ivan Perisic and the lumbering Bruno Petkovic, handed his first start of the World Cup, were unable to capitalise.\nJapan established a deserved lead shortly before the break from another smart corner routine. Ritsu Doan, rewarded with a start for his goalscoring substitute appearances against Germany and Spain, played it short to Kamada. He found Morita, who returned possession to Doan. Taniguchi met the attacking midfielder\u2019s inswinging cross with a glancing header that struck Petkovic and fell perfectly for Maeda, and the Celtic striker gave Livakovic no chance from close range.\nAt that stage the World Cup was drifting away from Croatia and the 2018 runners-up were heading home with a whimper. But they produced the second\u2011half improvement that was desperately required to drag another tournament knockout tie to extra time.\nCroatia levelled 10 minutes after the restart and in style when Perisic met Dejan Lovren\u2019s deep cross with a precise, powerful header into Gonda\u2019s bottom left-hand corner. It travelled some distance too and brought Perisic his 10th goal at a major tournament, overtaking Davor Suker\u2019s Croatian record of nine.\nShuichi Gonda tipped over to prevent Modric edging Croatia ahead with a dipping shot from 25 yards and Livakovic did likewise to deny Endo at the other end. Otherwise there was precious little incident or finesse as the tie drifted towards extra time, where the ordeal continued.\nNikola Vlasic and Brozovic scored their spot-kicks before Marko Livaja casually hit a post but, with Japan losing their nerve and Livakovic excelling, beaten only by Takuma Asano during the shootout, it fell to Pasalic to send Croatia into familiar territory."

                    "body": "  3.30pm    Here\u2019s your match report, from Louise Taylor at the game. Thanks for joining us.      3.10pm    Poland celebrate. Robert Lewandowski in particular is delighted, having scored his 77th goal for his country, and his first at a World Cup finals. Poland had to dig deep for that win. It might have been different had Salem Al Dawsari, Saudi Arabia\u2019s hero against Argentina, scored from the spot just before half time. However Wojciech Szcz\u0119sny saved, then tipped the rebound effort spectacularly over the bar, and it turned out to be one of those days for the Saudis, who were impressive in attack but just couldn\u2019t find the final touch. But it\u2019s still all to play for in Group C. Over to Argentina and Mexico, who face off this evening!     3.03pm   FULL TIME: Poland 2-0 Saudi Arabia  Poland move to the top of Group C at Saudi Arabia\u2019s expense.      3.02pm    90 min +6: Saudi Arabia have had no luck with injuries this week, and they\u2019ve had no luck in front of goal today. Kanno tries to send a curler into the bottom right, but the ball bounces inches wide of the post. Szczesny wouldn\u2019t have got to it.     3.01pm    90 min +5: Al Abid is replaced by Bahbri.     3.00pm    90 min +4: Play is stopped so Al Abid can get some treatment for a sore face, Lewandowski having accidentally planted his knee on it.     2.58pm    90 min +3: Alobud makes his presence felt down the right and sends in a couple of crosses in short order. Both are easily cleared.     2.57pm    90 min +2: Poland win another corner, this time on the left. Frankowski swings it in. Al Owais punches it clear.     2.56pm    90 min +1: The first of seven bonus minutes, and Poland do nothing with their corner.     2.56pm    90 min: The Education City Stadium is pretty quiet now, with Poland almost home and hosed. Lewandowski dribbles down the inside-right channel and breaks through a tired Saudi defence. He\u2019s one on one with Al Owais! He attempts to dink over, but the keeper sticks out a strong arm to deflect wide right. What a save!   Updated at 3.07pm GMT    2.54pm    88 min: A chance for Alobud to run at the last man Bereszynski, but the Poland defender is not to be moved. Some stubborn behaviour, and Alobud is forced to turn tail.     2.52pm    87 min: Al Dawsari crosses deep from the left. Alobud rises highest at the far stick but can only waft a header onto the top of the net.     2.51pm    86 min: Al Shehri and the bitterly disappointed Al Malki make way for Alobud and Al Dawsari.     2.50pm    84 min: Lewandowski celebrates with the air of a man who has just had the weight of the world lifted from his shoulders. It\u2019s been a long time coming. When it did, it was farcical. But they all count!     2.49pm   GOAL! Poland 2-0 Saudi Arabia (Lewandowski 82)  Robert Lewandowski finally scores a goal at a World Cup \u2026 and it\u2019s a gift from Saudi Arabia. Al Bulayhi, on the left-hand corner of his own box, rolls a pass along the line towards Al Malki in the middle. Al Malki takes his eye off the ball and lets it roll under his boot. Lewandowski nicks it away and slots past Al Owais, simple as that!    Updated at 2.57pm GMT    2.46pm    80 min: Space for Al Gannam down the right. He chests a long pass down and creams a cross through the six-yard box. Al Shehri dives at the near post but can\u2019t connect. The Saudis have come so close, so often, but there\u2019s still no reward.  Updated at 2.46pm GMT    2.44pm    79 min: Abdulhamid dribbles into the Poland box from the left. He can\u2019t quite get a shot away. The ball breaks back to Almalki, with time and space to shoot from the edge of the D. His low fizzer sails inches wide of the right-hand post. Not entirely sure Szczesny was getting to that had it been on target.     2.42pm    77 min: Al Amri is back up and running.     2.41pm    76 min: Al Amri is down with a sore shoulder. On come the physios.     2.40pm    75 min: Saudi Arabia probe. Poland steal the ball and counter. Kaminski slips Lewandowski clear from the halfway line. Al Owais races out of his box and blasts the ball away from Lewandowski\u2019s reach, just in time.     2.39pm    73 min: Piatek makes his way down the right and cuts back for Lewandowski, who takes a first-time slap at goal. Blocked. Poland are threatening a second that would surely seal the deal.     2.36pm    71 min: Milik makes way for Piatek.     2.34pm    69 min: Al Dawsari sends a curler towards the bottom right. Szczesny is behind it all the way.     2.33pm    68 min: Al Abid slams the free kick straight into the Poland wall. What a waste.     2.32pm    67 min: Al Brikan dribbles down the inside-right channel and is crudely shoved over by Bielik. A free kick coming up in a very dangerous position, just outside the Polish box.     2.32pm    65 min: Al Gannam comes on for Al Burayk. Play restarts and Poland hit the woodwork again! A low cross from the right is met by Lewandowski, who sidefoots over Al Owais and onto the right-hand post! Poland denied by the frame of the goal twice in a couple of minutes!     2.30pm    64 min: The crossbar is still reverberating.     2.29pm    63 min: Zielinski is replaced by Kaminski. Play restarts, and Frankowski crosses from the left. Milik launches into a Keith Houchenesque diving header, aiming for the top left. His header crashes off the bar and away! That would have been a hell of a goal!   Updated at 2.35pm GMT    2.27pm    61 min: And another chance! Al Shehri dribbles in from the right and prepares to shoot, only to lose control of his legs. The ball breaks to Kanno, who hoicks over. How are Saudi Arabia not level?     2.26pm    60 min: A beautiful spin on the edge of the Poland box by Al Dawsari, making space in the pocket and slipping Al Brikan into the box. Al Brikan shoots across Szczesny but wide and high. What a chance!     2.25pm    59 min: \u201cThe goalmouth scramble has reignited the home, sorry Saudi, crowd,\u201d reports Hugh Molloy. \u201cYalla, yalla!\u201d     2.24pm    57 min: Cash converts in the rugby-union style from 30 yards. An equal level of absurdity to the melee of a couple of minutes ago.     2.22pm    55 min: A huge tangle in the Polish box. Al Abid, Al Dawsari and Al Shehri all attempt to prod home from six yards, legs and boots poking out of an absurd comic-strip cloud. Somehow they can\u2019t get past Szczesny, who makes a stop. His defenders chip in with a couple of blocks, and eventually the ball\u2019s blazed over the bar. How did that not go in?     2.19pm    53 min: Al Shehri clatters into the back of Krychowiak, and is fortunate to escape a booking.      2.17pm    51 min: Al Dawsari works his way down the left and earns a corner off Milik. The ball\u2019s worked from left to right and swung into the box by Al Burayk. Kanno attempts an overhead kick, but no Richarlison he. Wide right, though full marks for ambition.   Updated at 2.24pm GMT    2.15pm    49 min: Al Owais sprints over-confidently out of his box and nearly cleans out Krychowiak. Fortunately there\u2019s no contact or he\u2019d be in the wonderful world of Wayne Hennessey.     2.14pm    48 min: Al Abid\u2019s free kick is a waste of time. Poland clear it easily enough, and Milik draws a foul from Al Dawsari to release the pressure.     2.13pm    47 min: Al Burayk wins an early second-half corner for the Saudis. Al Abid takes, and takes long. The ball\u2019s half cleared, but Krychowiak bundles Al Burayk over and it\u2019s a free kick for the Saudis out on the right.     2.10pm    Saudi Arabia get the second half underway. They\u2019ve made one change, swapping out Al Naji for Al Abid. \u201cCash should definitely have walked,\u201d writes Ingo Herzke. \u201cThat elbow was far worse than the foul he was booked for. But he was allowed to make the Polish goal.\u201d     1.59pm    Half-time team talk, courtesy of Guillaume Cl\u00e9ment. \u201cThat video of Herv\u00e9 Renard\u2019s pep talk at half-time vs Argentina reminds me of the great Gallic tradition of the half-time hairdryer treatment as last seen in Aim\u00e9 Jacquet\u2019s verbal walloping of the French team at half-time of the semi-final vs Croatia in 1998. Even if you don\u2019t speak French, the tone and body language speak for themselves.\u201d      1.56pm   HALF TIME: Poland 1-0 Saudi Arabia  The exact same position the Saudis found themselves in against Argentina, you\u2019ll remember.     1.55pm    45 min +10: Al Dawsari takes a heavy touch allowing Poland to counter. Lewandowski should scoot clear, but he allows the ball to clank between his legs and away.     1.54pm    45 min +8: Frankowski slips a pass in from the right. Zielinski can\u2019t quite get to the ball, allowing Al Owais to deal with the situation.     1.53pm    45 min +7: A pause in play as Al Malki goes down, requiring treatment. We\u2019ll have more than ten added minutes now.     1.50pm    45 min +5: You\u2019ll notice we\u2019re well into added time. There\u2019s going to be another five minutes of it as well.     1.49pm    45 min +4: Al Amri is booked for a frustrated lunge on Lewandowski.     1.49pm    45 min +3: Szczesny looked off his line \u2013 just \u2013 when Al Dawsari took that penalty. But here we are.  Updated at 2.04pm GMT    1.48pm    45 min +2: That\u2019s sucked the air out of the stadium all right. Poland celebrated Szczesny\u2019s saves as you would a goal.  Updated at 2.04pm GMT    1.47pm    45 min +1: \u2026 but Szczesny gets down and parries! The rebound falls to Al Burayk, who blazes over! Hold on, no he doesn\u2019t! That\u2019s on target, and Szczesny has made a stunning reflex save! There\u2019s a question as to whether Szczesny was off his line for the initial save, but there won\u2019t be a retake, and the corner comes to nothing.    Updated at 2.04pm GMT    1.46pm    45 min: Al Brikan prepares to take. Lewandowski trots up and stands in front of him. Delaying tactics to unsettle Al Brikan \u2026 and so Saudi change the taker! Al Dawsari steps up and aims for the bottom left \u2026     1.45pm   Penalty for Saudi Arabia!  44 min: The referee goes over to the screen, makes the TV mime, and points to the spot. The crowd go wild!   Updated at 1.48pm GMT    1.44pm    43 min: Noise back up! Al Shehri goes over in the box. It\u2019s theatrical, but Bielik has made contact with his ankle. VAR to check!     1.43pm    42 min: That\u2019s quietened the stadium a little. \u201cMedia and BP section placement absolutely killing Mexican Waves this World Cup,\u201d writes Hugh Molloy. \u201cI\u2019ll leave it with you to decide if this is a good thing!\u201d     1.42pm    40 min: Poland, their tails suddenly up, nearly make it two in short order. Lewandowski powers down the inside-right channel and whistles the ball across the face of goal. There\u2019s nobody in white there to trundle home.     1.40pm   GOAL! Poland 1-0 Saudi Arabia (Zielinski 39)  Saudi Arabia have been the better side, but it\u2019s Poland who lead! Cash is sent scampering into space down the right. He crosses low. Lewandowski tries to lift the ball over Al Owais, but the ball breaks to the right of the six-yard box. Lewandowski chases after the ball himself and cuts back for Zielinski, who roofs home from six yards!    Updated at 1.50pm GMT    1.39pm    38 min: Al Bulayhi is bandaged and back up and running.     1.38pm    37 min: Al Bulayhi is down, Lewandowski having accidentally studded him on the arm accidentally in that aforementioned incident. The pause in play allows Renard to give Al Naji and Al Shehri some beneficial tactical advice in this style:      1.36pm    36 min: Lewandowski thinks he\u2019s battled his way past Al Bulayhi down the right, but as he prepares to shoot from a tight angle, the referee penalises him for pulling his opponent to the ground.     1.35pm    34 min: Al Amri crunches into Milik. Hard but fair. The crowd loved that. A huge roar. \u201cBrilliant family, as well as febrile, atmosphere in today,\u201d reports this report\u2019s co-author Hugh Molloy.     1.33pm    32 min: Abdulhamid works his way down the right and cuts back for Al Naji, who whistles a cross through the Polish box. Al Shehri can\u2019t get on the end of it. Poland aren\u2019t settled at all.     1.31pm    30 min: A long ball nearly releases Lewandowski down the middle. The big man can\u2019t control. Saudi counter, and Kanno foolishly but deliberately handballs on the edge of the Polish box. No need for it, but he doesn\u2019t go into the book, much to the annoyance of several Poland players and assorted members of their bench.     1.28pm    28 min: One of Herv\u00e9 Renard\u2019s assistants cops a yellow card for excessive flapping of the neck. He accepts his punishment meekly and sits back down in the dugout.     1.27pm    26 min: Poland win their first corner down the right, and nearly convert it. Zielinski swings it in. Bielik rises and sends a powerful header goalwards. Al Shehri, near his own goalline, eyebrows it over the bar. Nothing comes of the next corner.    Updated at 1.33pm GMT    1.25pm    24 min: Al Sawsari dribbles fast and hard down the left. Poland backpedal fast. Al Sawsari is forced to turn tail, but Saudi probe again, this time down the right. Glik clears Abdulhamid\u2019s cross.     1.22pm    22 min: After a brief period of treatment, Al Burayk is back up and about. Cash has the good grace to look a bit sheepish. He knows he might have got away with one there.     1.21pm    20 min: Cash sticks his elbow into Al Burayk\u2019s neck. Al Malki isn\u2019t happy at all with the foul, and tells the referee as much. He gets booked for his trouble and will miss the next game. As for Cash, he\u2019s very fortunate not to see a second yellow. Another referee might have sent him packing there.     1.19pm    19 min: Yet another Polish booking as Milik tugs at the in-flight Al Amri\u2019s shirt. Poland aren\u2019t coping well with the Saudi press at all.     1.17pm    17 min: Al Burayk swings a harmless free kick into the Polish box. Easy for Szczesny.     1.17pm    16 min: \u2026 and Cash quickly follows him into the book, sliding in late on Al Dawsari. Kiwior\u2019s yellow was slightly harsh, but there was nothing for Cash to complain about there.   Updated at 1.22pm GMT    1.15pm    15 min: The first booking of the match. Kiwior accidentally high-kicks Al Shehri and sees yellow.     1.14pm    13 min: Cash thinks he\u2019s sent Lewandowski free down the middle but the referee pulls the play back for a foul. There didn\u2019t seem a whole lot wrong with that. The lively Kanno goes up the other end and aims for the top right, forcing Szczesny to tip over the bar. Nothing comes of the resulting corner but the underdogs appear to be in the mood to do their thing again.     1.12pm    11 min: Kanno is definitely in the mood to put it about. He slides in late on Krychowiak and is lucky not to go into the book. \u201cThis is the best atmosphere by miles,\u201d reports our man in the stand Hugh Molloy. \u201cArabia vs The World.\u201d   Updated at 1.15pm GMT    1.10pm    10 min: Saudi have enjoyed 57 percent of possession so far. But it\u2019s Poland who nearly fashion the first big chance, Bereszynski rolling a pass down the inside-left channel that nearly finds Lewandowski in the box. The ball sails through to Al Owais in the Saudi goal.     1.08pm    8 min: A corner for Saudi on the right. Nothing comes of it.   Updated at 1.18pm GMT    1.06pm    7 min: Sorry, we\u2019re having some technical issues. You\u2019ve not missed much.  Updated at 1.09pm GMT    1.04pm    4 min: Saudi are on the front foot early doors. Al Shehri dribbles into the Polish box from the left but can\u2019t work enough space to shoot from a tight angle.  Updated at 1.07pm GMT    1.02pm    2 min: All Naji skitters in from the left and slips over. He wants a free kick on the edge of the box but he\u2019s not getting one. The predominately Saudi-supporting crowd boo vociferously.      1.01pm    1 min: A fairly brisk start. Passes not sticking. Kanno leaves one on Lewandowski, just to let him know he\u2019s there.   Updated at 1.10pm GMT    1.00pm    Saudi pose for a group photo. They hold up the shirt of the stricken Yasser Al-Shahrani, a show of support and love. Then Poland get the ball rolling.     12.55pm    The teams are out! Poland in white, the Saudis in second-choice green. Hugh Molloy is at the ground with his four-year-old, Rufus. \u201cIt\u2019s clear that the Qatari supporters are firmly on team Saudi today,\u201d he writes. \u201cAs to fashion, there\u2019s a brilliant 50/50 split between Saudi shirts and traditional white thobes. Those with white gutras, the head piece, tend to be Qatari, the red/white check style is more Saudi. It\u2019s 99% Saudi fans and band wagon jumping neutrals today. Rufus is on team Poland because his favourite colour is red.\u201d We\u2019ll be off once the anthems are played.  Updated at 12.56pm GMT    12.38pm    Pre-match pep talk.  \u201cI found the video of Herv\u00e9 Renard\u2019s halftime team talk from the Argentina game really interesting,\u201d writes K\u00e1ri Tulinius. \u201cHis body language is so expressive that the Arabic interpreter is almost unnecessary. I feel I would\u2019ve understood him even with the sound off.\u201d     12.33pm    Poland boss Czeslaw Michniewicz has responded to accusations of being overly defensive by giving Robert Lewandowski a strike partner. Arkadiusz Milik will assist their star man up front. Saudi Arabia are without Yasser Al-Shahrani. The defender collided with his own keeper, Mohamed Al-Owais, during the last throes of the win over Argentina and suffered a broken jaw and internal bleeding. He\u2019s had surgery back home and happily has posted on Twitter that his \u201chealth is good\u201d.     12.12pm   The teams  Poland: Szczesny, Bereszynski, Glik, Kiwior, Cash, Bielik, Krychowiak, Frankowski, Zielinski, Milik, Lewandowski.Subs: Jedrzejczyk, Wieteska, Bednarek, Damian Szymanski, Grosicki, Skorupski, Kaminski, Swiderski, Zurkowski, Sebastian Szymanski, Zalewski, Grabara, Piatek, Gumny, Skoras. Saudi Arabia: Al-Owais, Abdulhamid, Al-Amri, Al-Bulayhi, Al-Burayk, Al-Malki, Al-Buraikan, Al-Naji, Kanno, Salem Al-Dawsari, Al-Shehri.Subs: Al-Rubaie, Al-Ghanam, Madu, Otayf, Al-Hassan, Al-Abed, Bahbri, Al-Aboud, Al-Aqidi, Nasser Al-Dawsari, Asiri, Tambakti.     11.31am   Preamble  In case you were wondering what that almighty rattle was, the earth was knocked off its axis last Tuesday by this \u2026  \u2026 and now Saudi Arabia are one win away from securing a place in the last 16 for only the second time in their history. The first being 1994, Belgium, Saeed Al-Owairan, all that. Poland\u2019s uninspiring goalless draw with Mexico \u2013 in which Robert Lewandowski missed a penalty \u2013 will surely have given the Saudis extra belief that they can make it. Not that they really require it after seeing off Lionel Messi et al, but you get the general gist. Poland meanwhile will feel a win is essential, with a final game against pre-tournament favourites Argentina coming up. Kick off is at 1pm GMT, 4pm at the Education City Stadium in Al Rayyan. \u0627\u0646\u0647 \u064a\u062d\u062f\u062b! It\u2019s on!   "

To receive the full version once a week, just pop your email in below:  Welcome, 2023. Women\u2019s football fans, this is our time to count the seconds until New Zealand v Norway kicks off the World Cup on 20 July. Expectations are high for the tournament and there is an expectation it will increase interest in the women\u2019s game in Australia and New Zealand, the host countries that will be the centre of the football world for a month. \u201cI dream of a cultural shift from the World Cup,\u201d says Moya Dodd, chair of Common Goal, and a former Matildas vice-captain who was a member of the Fifa Council until 2017. \u201c[I hope] that women can enjoy gender equality in sports and all roles in society, that football is fully embraced as a truly Australian sport and that football becomes a holistic and inclusive game where everybody belongs.\u201d  Legacy plans for the host nations discuss the importance of achieving gender parity in football, supporting future generations of girls who want to play. Dodd says that although she is excited to see the game growing, it is bittersweet to think that for decades women were banned and shunned. \u201cWhy couldn\u2019t our mothers have been professionals or at least players?\u201d she says. \u201cWhy couldn\u2019t I grow up seeing women\u2019s football in the media?\u201d She hopes Australia hosting the World Cup will lead more people in her country to realise the importance of \u2013 and potential for \u2013 the growth of the women\u2019s game and be reflected in participation numbers. \u201c2023 is a once-in-a-generation chance to make up a lot of ground,\u201d she says. \u201cWe have to seize the moment.\u201d  Dodd also highlights the importance of promoting the A-League Women, Australian\u2019s top division. Wellington Phoenix, a New Zealand professional team, are one of 11 clubs in the competition. \u201cJust as the Euros gave a lift to the WSL, I want to see the World Cup deliver new audiences to the league here in Australia and to all pro leagues around the world. \u201cThese competitions create jobs for women in the game, show week in, week out entertainment to fans and elevate role models for aspiring players. The leagues and the national team competitions uplift each other.\u201d  For fans travelling to Australia for the World Cup there are many opportunities for sightseeing \u2013 Dodd particularly recommends the central market and Rundle Street in her home town Adelaide and Sydney Harbour Bridge. She also identifies the opportunity to learn how to speak Australian \u2013 \u201ceven if you\u2019re flat-out like a lizard drinking\u201d (for non-Australians it means \u201ceven if you\u2019re extremely busy\u201d). Dodd says the World Cup is also a chance for visitors and tourists to understand Australia\u2019s culture. \u201cI hope they can appreciate that Australia is home to the oldest continuous civilisation in the world. They have been custodians of this land for 65,000 years.\u201d  She also points out the importance of traditions such as Welcome to Country, a ceremony performed by a traditional owner or custodian to welcome visitors to their ancestral land, usually at the beginning of an event. \u201cTake time to understand and appreciate it,\u201d Dodd says. Both World Cup legacy plans aim to support the inclusion of Indigenous girls and women in football. M\u0101ori and Indigenous Australians will have opportunities and programmes developed for these communities. Football Australia\u2019s participation pillar seeks to introduce a national Indigenous programme and New Zealand Football aims to have more M\u0101ori making meaningful connections throughout the game. \u201cThe Matildas are a hugely popular team and their presence is very tangible,\u201d Dodd says. \u201cMy only wish is that each Matilda be the best she is capable of, so that the team collectively can be at its best. Nothing could be better than that and nobody could ask for more.\u201d Talking point It was 1991. The first Women\u2019s World Cup took place in China and, in the stands, the greatest men\u2019s footballer of all time was impressed by what the players were doing on the pitch. \u201cNo one should be ashamed to give a football to a girl,\u201d said Pel\u00e9. During the Tokyo Olympics, 30 years later, he congratulated Marta when she became the first woman to score in five consecutive Games. \u201cHow many dreams do you think you inspired today?\u201d he wrote. After Pel\u00e9\u2019s death last Thursday, it feels important to remember him and his influence on the game. As Marta said: \u201cThrough your feet, we were and will be blessed by your art.\u201d Rest in peace, Pel\u00e9.  Quote of the week \u201cYou get to a certain age when you actually say: \u2018This is a really big fucking problem.\u2019 I\u2019m pretty sure if men had periods we would have figured out a way to stop them by now without doing any damage\u201d \u2013 Leah Williamson on living with endometriosis in Women\u2019s Health.

                    "body": "Harry Kane looked broken, already haunted. When he stopped to speak to reporters in the small hours of Sunday morning, the crush began on the other side of the barrier, TV cameramen pushing from the back, everybody wanting to see and hear.\nKane\u2019s lips moved and there were words, completely monotone, but it was as if he was not there, it was not him. We were looking at a hollowed-out version of the England captain. Somewhere else in Al Bayt Stadium, the real Kane looked at the apparition, too. What was going on? What had just happened?\nIt was just so sad because Kane did not deserve this. As England trailed France 1-0 in the World Cup quarter-final, he had led the revival, carrying the physical fight to Dayot Upamecano, going close on a couple of occasions, giving his team hope. He scored the equaliser in the second half with a penalty but, at 2-1, it all fell apart for him when he blazed a second spot\u2011kick high. It was the 84th minute. England could not recover and exited in the usual blaze of emotions.\n\nThe first thing to say is that had Kane scored, England would still have had a lot to do to beat the defending champions, most likely in extra time or on penalties. Nobody knows what would have happened. But in the moment, everyone thought they knew. England would have had the momentum at a crucial time. They were already playing well; now they would sweep to a statement victory and a semi-final against Morocco. Morocco! Just imagine.\nKane has been left to carry a heavy burden and it is uncharted territory for him. The 29\u2011year\u2011old has experienced setbacks in his career, beginning with the notorious release by Arsenal as an eight-year-old. There were the difficult loans at Norwich and especially Leicester, tough questions about whether he would make the grade at Tottenham.\nKane had the one-season wonder jibes in 2014-15. He has endured three cup final defeats (League Cup 2015 and 2021, Champions League 2019); injuries; the failed push to get a move to Manchester City in the summer of last year. But it is very difficult to remember him making an error on the pitch that has so obviously cost his team.\n\nSince the 90th-minute deflected winner for Spurs at Aston Villa in November 2014 that ignited his top\u2011level career, there has been the sense of his stars aligning, of season\u2011on\u2011season progress, the development of his game.\nIn the Euro 2020 semi-final against Denmark, he had an extra-time penalty to give England a 2-1 lead and he fluffed it, shooting weakly at Kasper Schmeichel. Yet the goalkeeper made an even bigger mistake. Schmeichel ought to have caught the ball. At the very least, he should have pushed it away from goal. Instead, he patted it back to Kane, who gobbled up the rebound. It seems strange to criticise a goalkeeper for saving a penalty but Schmeichel had to do more.\nKane got away with it and England won 2-1. Even when things had threatened to go wrong for him, they ended up so right. It was a different story on Saturday night \u2013 a footnote being that he missed out on a 54th England goal and the outright scoring record for his country, ahead of Wayne Rooney. He will have to wait a little longer for that.\nAll eyes will be on how Kane reacts. He is famously single\u2011minded and resilient and there is no doubt he will want to get back on the pitch as soon as possible. At least that will happen in relatively short order \u2013 the winter World Cup has this upside for him.\nSpurs\u2019 next game is at Brentford on Boxing Day, which was where Bukayo Saka played in his first competitive fixture for Arsenal after his penalty miss in the Euro 2020 final shootout defeat against Italy. Back then, the Brentford fans applauded him. Saka\u2019s situation had an extra, appalling dimension. He had been racially abused on social media and the crowd wanted to rally round him.\nKane tweeted on Sunday that he would not hide from his penalty miss. \u201cIt hurts and it\u2019ll take some time to get over it,\u201d he wrote. The out\u2011of\u2011body experience has happened. The recovery starts here."

                    "body": "An angry team meeting. Home truths exchanged. Defeat used as a launchpad for improvement. West Germany did it in 1954 after defeat by Hungary and went on to win the World Cup. They did it in 1974 after defeat by East Germany and went on to win the World Cup. They did it in 1982 after defeat by Algeria and went on to reach the final. But that was in the old days, when Germany was a Turniermannschaft \u2013 a tournament team \u2013 and they could rely on their leaders, their F\u00fchrungsspieler, to drag them through.\nThere was an angry team meeting after Germany\u2019s defeat by Japan on Wednesday, but they are no longer a Turniermannschaft and they no longer seem to have any F\u00fchrungsspieler. For the first time in 20 years, questions are being asked about the direction of German football.\nThe problem when talking about national sides is how little evidence there is. Friendlies can\u2019t be taken seriously. A lot of qualifiers are mismatches. And so everything comes down to a handful of tournament games, when one decision, one mistake, one moment of brilliance, can transform the perspective. Which is why it\u2019s worth beginning by going back to 2014 and Germany\u2019s World Cup triumph.\n\nThe 7-1 win against Brazil in the semi-final, understandably, demands the attention. But that game was really a story of Brazilian hysteria and indiscipline, ruthlessly punished by a Germany forward line supremely drilled in transition, as it had been in beating Portugal in the group; and putting four past Australia, England and Argentina at the previous World Cup.\nThe key moment in Germany\u2019s 2014 success had come after the edgy 2-1 win over Algeria in the last 16. Jogi L\u00f6w, recognising that his team had been fortunate in that game and against Ghana in the group \u2013 what if Jordan Ayew had squared it with Ghana 2-1 up? \u2013 went for a run along the beach in Rio. By the time he got back he had decided to go back to basics. Miroslav Klose returned at centre-forward, the fluid front three was abandoned and the centre was blocked up. The result was the functional 1-0 wins over France and Argentina (and the Brazilian self-immolation).\nThe World Cup win is the high point of Das Reboot, the process of reform that began in 2000 as Germany shifted from being a country dismissive of pressing to becoming its most enthusiastic proponent. The new German school \u2013 J\u00fcrgen Klopp turbocharged the revolution with his eloquent TV punditry in 2006 \u2013 became dominant across Europe, but the World Cup win was ultimately an outlier; it had in its final stages very little to do with aggressive pressing.\n\nL\u00f6w always seemed caught between a desire to play in the modern style he had helped usher in as assistant to J\u00fcrgen Klinsmann at the 2006 World Cup and a stodgier but perhaps more effective approach. Germany under him could be attractive, attacking and vulnerable, or dull, defensive and impregnable. After 2014 he never quite got the balance right, culminating in the embarrassing group-stage exit four years ago.\nThere was talk then about cliques and L\u00f6w\u2019s failure to integrate the younger generation who had led Germany to spectacular success at the Confederations Cup in 2017. Failure has many fathers but what has been apparent over the past few months is how that basic tactical issue persists. Hansi Flick was successful with a pugnaciously high line at Bayern Munich, winning the Champions League in 2020. But even with a goalkeeper as adept at sweeping as Manuel Neuer it is very hard, given the limited time available, to implement that with a national team.\nSqueezing high up the pitch, trying to win the ball back as near to the opponent\u2019s goal as possible, shutting down counters before they\u2019ve had a chance to develop, may be the most effective way of attacking. But the downside is the space left behind the defensive line and, as Liverpool in 2020-21 and again this season have shown, it doesn\u2019t take much for it to go awry.\n\nLook at Germany\u2019s defeat by Italy in Euro 2012, at the wobble against Ghana in 2014, at the defeats by Mexico and South Korea at the last World Cup, at the struggles against Hungary at Euro 2020 and again this summer, and the same patterns recur: Germany are vulnerable to balls played in behind them. That was the source of both Japan goals: first from a counterattack and then from a simple free-kick. Suddenly Germany is doubting its reformation.\nThe present system of coaching clearly produced technically adept, tactically intelligent players, but has something been lost along the way? Where are the modern-day Beckenbauers, Rummenigges, Matth\u00e4uses, the leaders who will drag them through? Are they focusing too much on rondos and not enough on individual battles?\nIt\u2019s not just a German problem. There is a curious dearth of young centre-forwards at this World Cup, which is why Cristiano Ronaldo, Luis Su\u00e1rez and Olivier Giroud (or Karim Benzema had he been fit) remain so central to their sides. Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 is the obvious exception, but even he prefers not to play as the out-and-out striker. But that\u2019s an understandable outcome given how influential Spanish football, or more specifically Pep Guardiola\u2019s vision of football, has been in shaping the ethos of modern western European academies. Spain have not really had a top-class centre-forward since David Villa\u2019s broken leg in 2011.\nPerhaps Germany would have finished Japan off in the first hour had Timo Werner not sustained a pre-tournament ankle injury but, for them, the issue is less to do with individual battles in the forward line than at the back. Perhaps bringing in Thilo Kehrer for Niklas S\u00fcle will eliminate the sort of error that led to Japan\u2019s second, but that inability to press well enough to play as high as Flick desires is leaving Germany vulnerable.\nThis may be the paradox of Das Reboot; that what has made the German idea of football so successful at club level is precisely what is undermining the national side."

It was there that Japan came within minutes of qualifying for their first World Cup, only to be denied qualification for USA 1994 by a stoppage-time equaliser by their opponents, Iraq.\n\nWednesday\u2019s victory sparked impromptu celebrations at the famous scramble crossing in Shibuya and calls for the prime minister, Fumio Kishida, to follow Saudi Arabia\u2019s example by calling a public holiday.\nYui Sasaki, a Tokyo office worker, was among hundreds of fans who watched the match at a public viewing venue in the capital. Fighting back tears, Sasaki told the Asahi Shimbun: \u201cHonestly speaking, before the match I thought it would need a miracle for Japan to win.\u201d\n\nKishida invited derision on social media after a tweet appeared on his official account while the match was taking place in which he mentioned his visit earlier in the day to the imperial palace. \u201cI expressed my gratitude for a bountiful harvest and prayed for the prosperity of the imperial family and the peace of the nation,\u201d he wrote. The response from social media users: why aren\u2019t you watching the football?\nBut Kishida, whose approval ratings are at a record low over his party\u2019s ties to the controversial Unification church, managed to capture the national mood on Thursday morning. \u201cI watched the match on TV \u2026 it was a wonderful victory,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cI hope they can keep going and make it to the knockout stages.\u201d\nAmong the Japanese public figures congratulating the team on Twitter was the tennis player Kei Nishikori, who simply posted a row of eight Hinomaru flags.\nThe victory was the lead story in broadsheet and tabloid newspapers, with some noting that the agony of 29 years ago had been replaced in the national consciousness by the \u201cMiracle of Doha\u201d.\nBeneath headlines marking Japan\u2019s \u201cmomentous\u201d and \u201cstunning\u201d victory over the four-time World Cup winners, media reports heaped praise on coach Hajime Moriyasu \u2013 a member of the team whose dreams had been shattered in Doha 29 years earlier \u2013 whose five half-time substitutions proved to be a stroke of genius.\nSocial media lit up with praise for Asano, who plays for the German Bundesliga club VfL Bochum, and Japan\u2019s other goalscorer, Ritsu Doan, who also plays his club football in Germany with SC Freiburg.\nSome credited Japan\u2019s victory to Taiyo, a river otter at a Tokyo aquarium that had predicted the result the day before the match after placing a miniature football in a blue bucket marked with the Japanese flag, snubbing a red one with the German flag and a yellow one that was labeled \u201cdraw\u201d, according to the Kyodo news agency.\nYujiro Nakao, a Tokyo businessman and lifelong Samurai Blue supporter, said the team had shown courage by refusing to give up after a \u201chopeless\u201d first half. \u201cIn the second half, they changed their tactics and started attacking more,\u201d said Nakao, who watched the match at home with his wife.\n\n\u201cMoriyasu has been criticised a lot in the past, but he showed he can be a good strategist. I predict \u2013 I hope \u2013 that we can beat Costa Rica and draw against Spain. I\u2019ll be cheering them on.\u201d\nMisae Minami, a teacher in Osaka, said she had a feeling that Japan would prove the pundits wrong. \u201cMost people expected Germany to win, but I was hopeful because Japan\u2019s young players have improved dramatically, and quite a few of them play for German clubs. You could see that our players are getting stronger mentally and physically because they refused to give up even after Germany scored first.\u201d\nJapan are now dreaming of a place in the last 16 for the fourth time, and of making the quarter-finals for the first time. While the Germany match kicked off at 10pm local time on Wednesday, the time difference will be kinder to Japanese fans when their team meet Costa Rica early on Sunday evening.\n\u201cI can\u2019t wait for the next match,\u201d Minami said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to win that one too!\u201d"

                    "body": "There was more time. When you are Lionel Messi, there is always more time. Another split second to play the pass. Another couple of beats to wait for the space to open up. Another year to mount a challenge. Another World Cup to fight. And here, on a bright warm day in November, with the clocks striking 13 minutes of injury time, there were still a few more seconds for Argentina to make things right.\nMessi advanced down the right channel, nudging the ball along with impatient taps of his left outstep. A little space had opened up in front of him in the Saudi Arabia midfield. \u00c1ngel Di Mar\u00eda was making the overlapping run on the right wing. In between him and the goal stood three defenders. Briefly, thrillingly, you could see the cogs whirring as Messi contemplated taking them all on and saving the match on his own. Instead, the pass went sideways to Di Mar\u00eda and the cross went nowhere. There is always more time.\nNot here, perhaps, but later. There are two games remaining in this group, processes to be trusted, faith to be kept. Even after a disaster on this seismic and stunning scale, the methods that brought Argentina to Qatar as one of the tournament favourites on a run of 36 unbeaten games must remain intact, if only because they have little other choice. The stakes were always this high. The margins of failure were always this punishing.\n\nArgentina\u2019s fatal mistake here was in deluding themselves otherwise. The 21st century\u2019s greatest World Cup shock did not immediately portend itself. As Saudi and Argentinian fans converged on the giant golden boat of the Lusail Stadium under cloudless midday skies, the atmosphere was almost festive: selfies on the metro, hugs on the concourses, Saudis wearing Messi shirts, Qataris wearing Messi shirts, Australian tourists wearing Messi shirts.\nNothing that unfolded in a vivid and entertaining first half seemed to shake that air of informality. It was 1\u20110, but the ball had hit the Saudi net so many times that it didn\u2019t feel like a 1-0. In truth what was happening was that Herv\u00e9 Renard\u2019s immaculate defensive line was perfectly disrupting Argentina\u2019s buildup, forcing them to go for a little more, to play the pass a little earlier or later than they would have liked. This was how Argentina scored \u2013 or didn\u2019t score \u2013 their three offside goals.\n\nNobody seemed overly perturbed at any of this. There was, after all, always more time.\nWhat of Messi? Well, he got his goal, a delightful confidence trick of a penalty in the 10th minute. But for the most part he, too, was easing himself into the tournament, sniffing the air, trying to keep a lid on things. We already knew this about him, of course: the way he likes to spend the opening minutes just walking and watching, getting to know the shape and heft of the game, working out where the spaces might open up. Messi is probably the only guy in the world who actually reads all the terms and conditions.\n\nBut at the same time Argentina seemed to soften a little, convinced that all they needed to do was to manage the game through to its inevitable conclusion. More and more their attacks began to break down, or dissolve into harmless spells of possession. Meanwhile the precise physicality of the Saudi defensive rearguard was beginning to disrupt them. Every single Saudi outfield player made at least one tackle. Eight of them blocked a shot. They attacked bravely and directly, Firas al-Buraikan and Salem al-Dawsari striding up the flanks like lone soldiers sprinting across no man\u2019s land. Slowly and by degrees, Saudi Arabia were beginning to sharpen the game to a point.\nEven so, when the equaliser came it still felt like something of a miracle, and was greeted as such by a deafening wall of Saudi pride and Saudi songs, Saudi men and more Saudi men. Certainly Argentina seemed stunned by the violence and suddenness of the assault. Rarely, if ever, can they have played a World Cup game in a neutral stadium and felt so thoroughly outnumbered, out\u2011chanted, outmatched. And it was in those infamous few minutes that the game was lost. Eardrums still stinging, hearts still pumping, heads still rattling, Nawaf al-Abid tried a curling shot, Di Mar\u00eda and Leandro Paredes lunged hopelessly at the rebound, and Dawsari fired the ball into the top corner to screams of anguish and disbelief.\n\nWhat did Argentina have left? As the tackles continued to pile in, as the crosses rained down on the goal of Mohammed al-Owais, as the Saudis in the crowd shredded what was left of their nerves, perhaps this is what will concern Lionel Scaloni most. The blend of urgency and composure that characterises all the great teams was entirely absent here: too bloodless in the first half, too confused in the second. The withdrawal of Paredes unbalanced them in midfield and, short of giving the ball to Messi, they were bereft of ideas in the final third.\nThis is not a team that have gone stale overnight. But whatever serenity, stability or momentum they had built up over the past three years has been shattered. Every remaining minute of their World Cup will now be played with a knife between their teeth, which could ultimately forge them or break them. Messi\u2019s own international career has never felt closer to oblivion. There is still time. But it is swiftly running out."

                    "body": "William Haggas, whose exceptional, unbeaten colt Baaeed is due to make his final trip to the races for the Qipco Champion Stakes at Ascot on Saturday, spoke this week about the extent to which everyone around the horse is carrying on as if it will be just another day at the track.\n\u201cWe\u2019re all lucky to have had this horse while he\u2019s been in training with us, and every single person has enjoyed the ride immensely,\u201d Haggas said. \u201cBut we can\u2019t go around getting tense and taut because he will then feel it. We\u2019ve just got to be normal, work normally and treat him, as best we can, as another horse in the yard, so that he knows no different. That\u2019s the idea.\u201d\n\nThe extent to which Haggas\u2019s \u201cdon\u2019t mention Saturday\u201d approach is for Baaeed\u2019s benefit \u2013 and not also an emotional crutch for a yard which is about to lose its superstar \u2013 is anyone\u2019s guess. But as any racing fan or punter who has followed Baaeed through his 10 races to date will affirm, very little about the four-year-old is in any way normal.\nBaaeed is not quite a once-a-century talent to match the extraordinary Frankel, who completed his own unbeaten career in the Champion Stakes a decade ago. He did not race as a juvenile, while Frankel was a champion in each of his three seasons on the track. And he did not line up for a Classic, whereas Frankel obliterated his three-year-old peers in the 2,000 Guineas, the first of a series of freakish performances that elevated his rating to an all-time record. Haggas\u2019s colt, in fact, may well not finish the 2022 as the top-rated racehorse on the planet, following the recent, explosive arrival of Flightline on American dirt.\n\nBut an unbeaten, multiple Group One winner, carrying that air of invincibility into final last race, is still a vanishingly rare commodity. \u201cI think it [his perfect record] is terribly important now that we\u2019re nearly there and we\u2019ve got one race to go,\u201d Haggas said. \u201cFrankel obviously was unbeaten but few are unbeaten in a career at that level so I think it would be sad if he was beaten.\u201d\nSea The Stars, Baaeed\u2019s sire and another of the modern greats, reeled off six Group One wins in his three-year-old season and took eight of his nine starts in all, but inexperience got the better of him first time out and he finished only fourth.\nIt was almost the same story for Baaeed when he made his belated three-year-old debut at Leicester on 7 July 2021, 48 hours after Adayar, the second-favourite for Saturday\u2019s race, had led home the best stayers of their generation in the Derby at Epsom.\n\nHe missed the break, took time to settle, dropped off the back of the screen two furlongs out and then looked clueless for several strides when, with several lengths still to find, his rider asked him to quicken.\nWhen the penny dropped, however, Baaeed accelerated to such an astonishing effect that he won by more than a length easing down. A star was born, and just three months later and four starts later, he bagged his first Group One in the Prix du Moulin at Longchamp.\nHis career path since has followed Frankel\u2019s to the race, from a win by a neck \u2013 the smallest margin of his career \u2013 in last year\u2019s Queen Elizabeth II Stakes on Champions Day, via Newbury, Royal Ascot, Glorious Goodwood and an emphatic step up from a mile to 10 furlongs in the International Stakes at York.\nBaaeed\u2019s winning run has also underpinned a serious challenge for the trainer\u2019s championship for the first time in Haggas\u2019s 34-year career with a licence, and he knows that there will not be another one like him through the doors at his Newmarket yard.\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t have a clue what makes him better, I wish we knew and then I could buy another one like him at the sales,\u201d he says. \u201cHe\u2019s just got everything, and I\u2019ve always likened my job to being the headmaster of a boarding school, in that the new boys or girls come in and we spend two years trying to work out which of them have got talent.\n\u201cThis horse would get 10 A stars at GCSE, he\u2019d be captain of rugby, cricket and football or hockey. He\u2019d breeze into Cambridge, he\u2019d be prime minister. He\u2019s just got it all, that pupil that every head wants.\u201d\nAdayar has had just a single race since finishing down the field in last year\u2019s Champion, but still promises to be as stern an opponent as Baaeed has faced in his career. A comprehensive defeat of last year\u2019s Derby winner could yet see him edge his official rating \u2013 currently 135 \u2013 a little closer to Frankel\u2019s final mark of 140.\nBut one more win, whether it is by a nose or 10 lengths, is what matters most of all. The near-impossible dream of breeding, owning or simply watching an unbeatable racehorse has fired the imagination of generations of racing\u2019s fans, and in that respect at least, Baaeed can still be an equal of the greatest horse of them all."

                    "body": "It used to be said that preparing for the 2023 Rugby World Cup was a gradual process. People liked to paint it as a painstaking four-year project, with an emphasis on steady incremental gains. Then everyone panicked. England, Wales and Australia have new head coaches with blank (ish) sheets of paper and there is an Old Testament feel to what happened just weeks ago. Because, suddenly, the marathon is a flat-out mass sprint. The three unions in question are banking on the ability of, respectively, Steve Borthwick, Warren Gatland and Eddie Jones to accelerate their teams from 0-60 mph quicker than you can say Top Gear. It feels like one of those initially slow track cycling races where everyone starts to pedal like crazy. The big question is which of the trio will prove most effective from their enforced standing start. In some ways, the pressure is slightly reduced because the timescale is so abbreviated; in other respects it has been seriously increased. At least Borthwick and Gatland have had some experience of the stresses and strains with the British &amp; Irish Lions.  Jones, for his part, has a few more precious months until the Wallabies next take the field. Borthwick and Gatland have the fast-approaching Six Nations championship to deal with. All they can do is focus on the bare necessities. Which, most startup businesses would agree, is not 100% ideal. Hence the absence of flam at England\u2019s Six Nations squad announcement at Twickenham. Borthwick is a meticulous man, but there is barely a second to waste. He needs people to perform right here, right now, rather than dealing in potential. As Billy Vunipola, Jonny May and Jack Nowell have found, credit in the bank is now a finite concept as well. Instead, clarity and simplicity are the new watchwords. Borthwick has picked his best players and those who have shown decent form recently. This should not be particularly newsworthy, but it almost feels radical after some of the selectorial meanderings of the last regime. Elliot Daly is back because he is playing well, not because he could be a decent utility bet at the World Cup. Ditto Ben Earl. And Max Malins. And Dan Cole. \u201cI have some fantastic players who are desperate to do well and desperate to build a team we can all be proud of,\u201d said Borthwick. Sometimes just stating the obvious can be music to the ears.  Only the captaincy, which has reverted to Owen Farrell, felt like a direct throwback to the Jones era. Even here, though, Borthwick has sought to strengthen the structural foundations around his skipper by announcing Courtney Lawes and Ellis Genge as his vice-captains. By also confirming his intention to coach the forwards and use Richard Cockerill as a specialist scrum coach, it is clear enough where Borthwick\u2019s short-term priorities lie. A tighter, better organised and more focused England should emerge as a consequence. But at Test level those should be minimum standards. And how long will it take? With their rivals also finalising their squads there remains a sense that any new coach bounce would have more longevity in a non-World Cup year. There is, after all, a pressing reason why the Rugby Football Union and the Welsh Rugby Union opted to rip things up now: their rivals are well ahead of them. Borthwick is already wary of what a more settled, cohesive Scotland will bring to Twickenham on 4 February. \u201cI\u2019d imagine they\u2019d come here full of confidence and wanting to take a shot at us.\u201d If Gatland, similarly, views his side\u2019s opening fixture against Ireland through the prism of Leinster\u2019s recent Champions Cup performances he has every reason to try to temper expectations. No one, though, knows more than Gatland about the art of realigning a rugby team in double quick time. The wily competitor in him will also be keen to give Jones something to think about, with Wales and the Wallabies sharing the same World Cup pool. Australia will be freshly emboldened by Jones\u2019s return, but the equation will be altered if Gatland can transform Wales\u2019s battered self-belief and Justin Tipuric, for example, can sustain their form. Bolstering fragile confidence will be Borthwick\u2019s biggest challenge, too. Uncapped squad arrivals such as wingers Ollie Hassell-Collins and Caden Murley carry minimal baggage, but the same cannot be said of one or two others. A clean slate sounds great; it is less easy to deliver in mid-season in harsh weather with certain individuals still bruised by their past experiences on England duty. Ultimately, it is more about restoring faith and trying to encourage players, at the very least, to enjoy their rugby. \u2018Miracle coaches\u2019 tend to be those who instinctively understand what style and gameplan will best suit the personnel at their disposal. England have loads of players and not enough coherence, Wales are looking to accelerate their rebuilding operation, Australia need to stop losing tight games and get all their best players back on the park. It makes the next nine months even more fascinating. Have all three countries left it too late? Will their decisions to twist rather than stick prove collectively inspired? Or will the trend for 11th-hour reboots turn out to be misguided? Conventional logic suggests Borthwick, Gatland and Jones have their work cut out. If one of them wins the World Cup, though, their place in coaching\u2019s all-time hall of fame will be assured.

                    "body": "Good morning. Donald Trump has formally announced his candidacy for the Republican presidential nomination in 2024, likely sparking another period of tumult in US politics and especially his own political party. \u201cIn order to make America great and glorious again, I am tonight announcing my candidacy for president of the United States,\u201d Trump said from the ballroom of his private Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach, Florida, last night, where he stood on a stage crowded with US flags and make America great again banners. Vowing to defeat Joe Biden in 2024, he declared: \u201cAmerica\u2019s golden age is just ahead.\u201d The long-expected announcement by a twice-impeached president who incited a deadly attack on Congress seems guaranteed to deepen a stark partisan divide that has fueled fears of increased political violence. But it also comes as Trump\u2019s standing in the Republican party has suddenly been put into question.  Will Trump\u2019s legal battles stand in the way? Federal and state authorities are investigating his personal, political and financial conduct, and that of his business empire. How any indictment would affect Trump\u2019s run remains unclear \u2013 he is experienced in using delaying actions in the courts and in using political or investigatory moves against him as fuel to fire up his base. Just a few months ago it was received wisdom that the Republican nomination was his for the taking. What happened? The star of the former president was already waning among the party faithful before the midterms, as Cas Mudde explores.  Poland missile \u2018unlikely\u2019 to have been fired from Russia, Biden says  Joe Biden has said the missile that landed in Poland, killing two people, was unlikely to have been fired from Russia because of its trajectory. The US president was speaking at the G20 summit in Bali, Indonesia, after convening an emergency meeting of western leaders to discuss the explosion on Nato territory that has the potential to take the war in Ukraine into a even more dangerous dimension. Asked whether the missile was fired from Russia, Biden said: \u201cThere is preliminary information that contests that. I don\u2019t want to say that until we completely investigate. But it is unlikely in the minds [sic] of its trajectory that it was fired from Russia.\u201d He added: \u201cBut we will see, we will see.\u201d The Polish foreign ministry described the rocket as \u201cRussian-made\u201d missile, a phrase that could include one from S-300 surface-to-air systems in the possession of Ukraine.  What might have happened? Turkey\u2019s president, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, said he took Russian denials of involvement in the attack seriously, adding it was likely to be a technical error.  Gay Qataris physically abused then recruited as agents, campaigner says  Gay Qataris have been promised safety from physical torture in exchange for helping the authorities to track down other LGBTQ+ people in the country, a prominent Qatari gay rights campaigner has told the Guardian. Dr Nasser Mohamed, who lives in the US but retains contact with hundreds of gay Qataris, said some secret networks had been compromised after arrests by the Gulf state\u2019s preventive security department. \u201cA lot [of gay Qataris] don\u2019t know about each other,\u201d Mohamed said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s safer that way because when the law enforcement finds one person, they actively try to find their entire network. But some of the people who were captured and physically abused were then recruited as agents. \u201cNow there are agents in the gay community that were promised safety from physical torture in exchange for working for the preventive security department and helping them find groups of LGBTQ+ people.\u201d Mohamed said foreign gay football fans would not be persecuted while at the World Cup finals in Qatar. However, he warned that local LGBTQ+ supporters faced a very different reality.  What has Fifa said in response? The world football governing body said it was committed to inclusivity and that it was \u201cconfident that all necessary measures\u201d would be in place for LGBTIQ+ fans \u201cand allies to enjoy the tournament in a welcoming and safe environment, just as for everyone else\u201d. What about Qatar? In a statement, the country\u2019s supreme committee for delivery and legacy promised the World Cup would be free of any discrimination. \u201cThe SC is committed to delivering an inclusive and discrimination-free Fifa World Cup experience that is welcoming, safe and accessible to all participants, attendees and communities in Qatar and around the world,\u201d it said.

However, documents and proposals seen by the Guardian, and accounts from negotiating teams, showed some countries attempting to unpick agreements and water down commitments.  What else is happening at Cop27? Follow our live coverage here.  Last Thing: Virginia McLaurin, who danced with Obamas as centenarian, dies at 113  Virginia McLaurin, a woman from Washington DC who was 106 when in 2016 she visited and danced with Barack and Michelle Obama in the White House, has died. She was 113 years old. A family statement said she had died after receiving hospice care for a few days, adding: \u201cShe lived an incredibly full life and appreciated all the love she received from people.\u201d When McLaurin visited the Obamas, footage of the joyous encounter quickly went viral. On the White House Facebook page, the video has been viewed 70m times. When McLaurin started dancing, the then president said: \u201cShe\u2019s dancing! Come on!

Maddison scored twice and set up another goal as Leicester overwhelmed rivals Nottingham Forest 4-0 to secure their first win of the season. Only Erling Haaland has more Premier League goals and assists than the 25-year-old since 11 May but Southgate has repeatedly overlooked Maddison, whose last England appearance came as a substitute against Montenegro in November 2019.  Rodgers said he hopes Southgate gives serious consideration to finding a spot for the midfielder in his 26-man squad for Qatar next month. \u201cI would really hope that there was a place for a player like that in a squad, where you\u2019ve got someone who is so talented and such a hard worker and such a team player,\u201d the Leicester manager said. \u201cThis [Maddison] is a player who can come into a game and change the course of a game. To have that ability, if he wasn\u2019t starting for you, on the bench to come in and bring something in a tight World Cup game, it\u2019s what a team like England needs.\u201d Rodgers said victory for Leicester in the first east Midlands derby of the season could prove \u201cseason-changing\u201d for his side and reiterated that Maddison has matured since arriving at the club from Norwich in 2018. \u201cWhen I first came in he was a young guy, you see his haircuts, his bags and all of that sort of stuff, but he\u2019s matured. \u201cJames is an absolutely brilliant player and I really hope over these next few months he can continue his form and somehow get into the [England] team.\u201d Steve Cooper\u2019s position is under intense scrutiny following five straight defeats, Forest\u2019s worst run in a season since January 2004, but the manager insists his players are still fighting for him. \u201cYou didn\u2019t see the team give up,\u201d Cooper said. \u201cI know it\u2019s a group of players that care. I\u2019m definitely not sensing that [they don\u2019t care] at the moment. \u201cWe are trying to become a successful team on the job, in the hardest domestic league in the world. We have to tackle it head-on.\u201d"

                    "body": "Everything is connected. A whistle blows in Doha and within fractions of seconds, via a lattice of mobile phone networks and whispers and nudges, its sound has somehow travelled the 30 miles to Al Khor. And the cheer around the stadium gives the game away, and on the Germany bench Hansi Flick senses a change in the air, and he takes a look around, and he glances at his bench, and he knows, he just knows. He turns back to face the pitch. But his hands are in his pockets, and his thoughts are elsewhere.\nEverything is connected. A World Cup group stage consists not simply of three discrete games but one cogent narrative, and if you don\u2019t pay attention at the start you may well miss something that you need later. Here Germany loaded all their usual programmes, moved the ball with pace, did their jobs, scored four goals. But although they didn\u2019t know it yet, none of it was any use to them. The game had already gone, and it had gone in eight wild minutes against Japan at the Khalifa International Stadium nine days earlier.\n\nThe great German sides could raise their game to suit the occasion, do whatever it took, squeeze every last drop out of their resources and system. Everyone does their job, and you win. For better and for worse, this team feel like its polar opposite. And so the problem comes when you combine the classic German mentality with a modern style of football that demands perpetual intensity, that needs every part of the machine to be 100% switched on at all times.\nThis game, as futile as it proved, was ample evidence of this. Germany were utterly dominant in the opening minutes and yet had just a single goal to show for it. Meanwhile Costa Rica went up the other end and scored twice in 12 chaotic minutes as the gloomy news filtered through from Doha and Germany allowed their minds to drift. Flick had withdrawn Ilkay G\u00fcndogan and Leon Goretzka in an attempt to engineer greater attacking thrust but in so doing had hollowed out his midfield and left Germany vulnerable to the counter. Everything is connected.\n\nKai Havertz came on and burgled two sharp goals; Niclas F\u00fcllkrug added a fourth with a classic poacher\u2019s finish. Germany had saved Spain but they were powerless to save themselves. There was, perhaps, a bitter symmetry in the scoreline. Germany 4-2 Costa Rica: the first game of the 2006 World Cup in Munich, the game that brought the curtain up on Germany\u2019s summer of love, unleashed a wave of footballing fervour that would carry them to a World Cup win in 2014 and a decade of golden memories. Now, ironically, the music has stopped on the very same chord.\n\nAnd so the postmortems can begin, the fingers can be pointed, the scapegoats sought. Flick may just pay for this debacle with his job, although the smart money is on him being given one more crack. There is, after all, talent to be mined here. Havertz, the wonderful Jamal Musiala, the teenage Dortmund striker Youssoufa Moukoko, the marvellous Leverkusen playmaker Florian Wirtz: technical players, modern players, players a good coach can build a team around.\nMeanwhile others will fall by the wayside. Thomas M\u00fcller has already hinted at retirement. Manuel Neuer and G\u00fcndogan may even go too. Mario G\u00f6tze has surely played his last tournament. There is a tactical blueprint, a base to build from, a home Euros in 2024 to work towards. German football has often prided itself on its composure, its refusal to press the panic button, its refusal even to acknowledge the existence of a panic button. Even after a third successive tournament failure it is possible to spin an enthusiastic yarn around this team, paint this setback as the inevitable collateral damage of a longer reinvention.\n\nYet it is impossible to shake the feeling that something essential has been lost here, too. Everything is connected. The grounds for German optimism are also the grounds for pessimism. The technical qualities of the new generation have come at a price: a lack of defensive rigour, a chronic absence of genuine strikers, an inability to capitalise on dominance or see out the tough periods, a naivete that at times has strayed into the realm of complacency.\nThese are not bad players. But for too long they have lacked direction, purpose, a safety net. Germany brought just a few thousand fans out to Qatar. The indifference back home is palpable. Since Euro 2016 they have been behind in every single tournament game they have played. And by 2026 it will be 12 years since they last reached the knockout stages of the World Cup. Everything is connected. And here, the four-time world champions learned that lesson in the cruellest of fashions."

                    "body": "Chelsea\u2019s staggering spending spree continued when they broke the British transfer record to sign Enzo Fern\u00e1ndez for \u20ac121m (\u00a3106.8m) after a frenzied day of negotiations with Benfica. The deal, confirmed by the London club early on Wednesday morning, takes Chelsea\u2019s spending under the Todd Boehly-Clearlake Capital ownership to more than \u00a3500m and is another sign of their determination to dominate the transfer market. Negotiations were led by the co-owner Behdad Eghbali, who was dogged throughout discussions with Benfica on Tuesday, and Graham Potter will hope Fern\u00e1ndez makes his side stronger in central midfield.  It is understood that Chelsea, who sold Jorginho to Arsenal for \u00a310m plus \u00a32m in add-ons earlier in the evening, reached an agreement with Benfica about two hours before the window shut at 11pm UK time. Fern\u00e1ndez\u2019s contract contained a \u20ac120m (\u00a3105.9m) release clause and Benfica were adamant it be paid in full. Chelsea failed with a bid for the 22-year-old earlier in the window but had made him their top target in midfield. Talks reopened over the weekend. Chelsea, who with this deal have bought 16 players since last season ended, were reluctant to trigger the clause because of concerns over breaching financial fair play regulations. Negotiations centred around payment structures that would satisfy FFP rules. Chelsea eventually agreed to pay more than the clause but over several instalments. The deal eclipses the previous British record \u2013 Jack Grealish\u2019s \u00a3100m move from Aston Villa to Manchester City in 2021. Benfica signed him last year from River Plate, who have a 25% sell-on clause. Chelsea continued with their policy of offering long-term deals. Fern\u00e1ndez, who helped Argentina win the World Cup in Qatar, has agreed an eight-year deal. The club believe that handing out such deals will help them meet FFP rules. Amortisation is the key \u2013 spreading the cost of a fee over the length of a contract. However, Uefa is set to change those regulations from the summer, with clubs expected to be stopped from spreading the cost of fees for more than a period of five years. Chelsea, who are 10th in the Premier League, handed Mykhailo Mudryk an eight-and-a-half-year half deal after signing the Ukraine winger from Shakhtar Donetsk for \u00a388.8m. Potter\u2019s team are out of both cups and face a fight to qualify for the Champions League. The hierarchy have backed Potter despite a string of disappointing performances. Along with paying huge fees for Mudryk and Fern\u00e1ndez, Chelsea paid \u00a38.8m to loan Jo\u00e3o F\u00e9lix from Atl\u00e9tico Madrid and bought Andrey Santos, David Datro Fofana, Beno\u00eet Badiashile and Noni Madueke. Malo Gusto was bought from Lyon and loaned back to the French club. A plan to loan Hakim Ziyech to Paris Saint-Germain collapsed at the last minute and Potter has been left with a huge squad. Chelsea will be able to register only three signings in their 25-man squad for the Champions League. They meet Borussia Dortmund in the last 16. Arsenal moved for Jorginho after accepting that Brighton would not sell Mois\u00e9s Caicedo. The last-ditch nature of the move for Fern\u00e1ndez ended any chance of Conor Gallagher leaving Chelsea, who had interest in the midfielder from Newcastle, Crystal Palace and Everton."

                    "body": "It would be too easy, not to mention cheap and pointless, to snigger and sneer and laugh at Cristiano Ronaldo right now.\nAnd yet I think we should still snigger and sneer and laugh at Cristiano Ronaldo, if only because laughter is probably as good a response as any to a week when Ronaldo has confirmed beyond all doubt he is definitely in it for the kids \u2013 and not, not for the money \u2013 by signing for Al Nassr of Riyadh in a mindboggling \u00a3173m-a-year sport-ertainment deal.\nOn one level you just have to laugh at the weirdness of this. Here is a move that is irrelevant to the conduct of elite professional sport but which also points with absolute clarity to the place where that world is heading.\n\nBut mainly it\u2019s just very funny, in the way everything that late, aggrieved Ronaldo does is funny when viewed as a real-time study in extreme, unfettered human egotism. Here is a footballer who celebrity-interviewed his way out of Manchester United while preaching about the disrespectful behaviour of others (source: that appalling TV \u201cinterview\u201d, an experience comparable to being stabbed repeatedly through the eyeballs with a heated kebab skewer forged out of pure human inanity).\nHow is this going to work on the ground? How long before Ronaldo is dropped for not pressing enough to meet the basic standards of Saudi PR-ball? How long before pictures emerge of him looking furious and sad in the King Saud University Stadium stands, statements leaked to the media about how the Al Nassr he loved is being betrayed, how terrible the cafe is, how un-fancy the gym equipment?\n\nAnd yet there is plenty of sadness here too, and indeed an important cautionary tale. The reality is simple. Ronaldo was a miraculously good footballer. Then he stopped being that. The noise, the acrimony, the vast tides of wasted money have all sprung from the gap between this hard sporting truth and the unspent power of the Ronaldo-industrial complex, its refusal to die, to stop earning, to accept that reality.\nIt has been uncomfortable to watch this happen, to see Ronaldo the footballer \u2013 still from the outside the same plasticised space-beefcake, the same snake-hipped wedding cake figurine come to life \u2013 depleted by age and mortality. There is a sadness too in seeing such an influential figure transformed into an avatar of human greed. It is easy to misunderstand Ronaldo\u2019s popularity, to dismiss it as marketing pap, incel-worship, celebrity fetishism.\nBut Ronaldo is also an uplifting tale. Here is a poor kid from a tough background who conquered the world through nothing but talent and hard work, who embodies sport as the dream factory. Ronaldo fixed his own destiny, fixed his body, fixed his teeth, fixed his broken start in life. If you\u2019re on the outside, if the world looks closed to you, here is an inspiring story.\n\nAnd now Ronaldo is telling us something just as important. One of biggest battles in Big Sport currently is the divide between the real and the fake. From the staging of the Qatar World Cup to Super League projects, to the cult of player celebrity, it is a key question: is this thing actually real? Can we trust the show in front of us?\nRonaldo has become a very handy divining tool for this strain of unreality. In this light his ejection from the Premier League should be seen as a triumph, a good news story, confirmation that this thing is at bottom still sport, that it still has hard edges.\nBy the same token there was no more heartwarming moment at Qatar 2022 than Fernando Santos, a 68-year-old with the manner and the dress sense of a rumpled 1970s New York detective with a bed that folds up into the wall, having the courage to drop Ronaldo and replace him with a 21-year-old. That dropping said the same thing: no matter what you chuck at this thing it remains, for now, essentially honest.\nWhat else have we got? Obviously the move back to United wasn\u2019t real, but was instead a celebrity waxwork installation, designed to give the illusion of life. Erik ten Hag has already done English football, and indeed the wider public discourse, a huge favour by forcing Ronaldo to leave, by insisting that there is still a line between the real and the fake.\n\nThe move to Al Nassr is obviously not real either. This week L\u2019\u00c9quipe called Ronaldo\u2019s contract \u201can economic aberration\u201d, but this only stands if we accept it is related to football. To call Ronaldo the highest-paid footballer in the world is like calling Tom Cruise the highest-paid fighter pilot. There is a reality issue here. Ronaldo is no longer engaged in sport. He is an actor, a publicity megaphone, a tool of power.\nAnd again there is a kind of sadness in this, questions about what exactly Ronaldo\u2019s own sporting legacy is going to look like. The best Ronaldo was in my opinion the 2008 version, accumulator of a record Ballon d\u2019Or points tally back when he was still an expressive, highly entertaining team player.\n\nHis progress from that point has been a paring back into the most literal-minded version of what winning means, a mobile goal-hammer, a provider of moments, elite football as TikTok reel.\nSix hundred goals. Five hundred hat-tricks. A million goals. The first man to score against every single team in every league all at the same time. Ronaldo\u2019s career can start to look like a kind of footballing masturbation, sport as endless self-glorification. What does it actually mean for him to win? That Ronaldo is great and famous and has defined muscles? Does it tell us anything about theory or collectivism or team-play or shared virtues?\nNo single figure has embodied sporting individualism to this degree, or reduced football so profoundly to an atomised celebrity obsession. Saudi is the final step in this direction, towards a product that is rootless and timeless, based instead in the consumption of images, brands, styling.\nRonaldo is at least telling us this, positioning himself entirely on one side of that battle. In this sense he has come to embody the age perfectly, and to point most clearly towards its fantastical, textureless future. This much, at least, feels real."

Though Sri Lanka are a team on the rise, and recent winners of the Asia Cup, these are not exactly the kind of blockbuster fixtures that will grab the world\u2019s attention, nor are they being played on one of Australia\u2019s legendary grounds.\n\nOn Monday, while the second group of the opening phase \u2013 which includes West Indies, as well as Scotland, Ireland and Zimbabwe \u2013 begins in Tasmania, many cricket fans will be distracted by events in Brisbane, where the eight teams that have automatically qualified for the second round play each other in warm-up matches.\nThis, though, is the more intriguing group, particularly for British fans. Scotland start against West Indies, the overwhelming favourites, not that the prospect is likely to daunt them. They opened last year\u2019s World Cup by playing the side generally considered the outstanding team in that group, beat Bangladesh and surfed into the Super 12s with a 100% record.\n\nBut there is one statistic that puts into focus the nature of the challenge facing the Scots: since Australia lifted the trophy in Dubai last November West Indies have played 24 T20 internationals, Ireland and Zimbabwe have played 22 and 16 respectively, and Scotland have played two. That is half as many as Botswana, a third of Vanuatu\u2019s total and a fifth of Hong Kong\u2019s. There were two unofficial warm-up games scheduled in Australia over the last week and they beat the Netherlands impressively in the first; but the second was rained off without a ball bowled on Thursday. They head into the tournament not so much undercooked as still a collection of raw ingredients.\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t played a lot of T20 cricket as a group since last year\u2019s World Cup but we know what we can do in this format,\u201d their coach, Shane Burger, said as the rain fell in Melbourne. \u201cI have faith that the guys are going to step up to the mark again when the tournament gets under way.\u201d\n\nIreland\u2019s preparation has been strong \u2013 India, New Zealand, South Africa and Afghanistan all visited over the summer and, though the first three left with 100% records, the Afghans were beaten 3-2. Despite the absence of their key bowler Craig Young, ruled out last week by the recurrence of a hip injury, a place in the Super 12s looks within their grasp. Motivation will certainly not be an issue, with memories still fresh of their failure to beat Namibia in their final group match which led to elimination.\n\nDespite the curious absence of Shimron Hetmyer, cut from the squad after failing to turn up for his flight to Australia, West Indies surely have enough quality to progress \u2013 as do Sri Lanka, by a margin the outstanding side in Group A. The Netherlands will aim to join them in the Super 12s despite the retirements of Ryan ten Doeschate and Pieter Seelaar. In their absence the Dutch have found a potential new leader in Bas de Leede, the 22-year-old batter who scored half-centuries in both T20s against New Zealand in August and 89 against Pakistan in an ODI.\nIf the rankings are accurate, Sri Lanka will top that group and join England, Australia, New Zealand and Afghanistan in the Super 12s while West Indies should win the second to move into the other pool. But should either of those sides come second, the result would be to tick another significant box and provide that crucial ingredient for any classic tournament: a group of death."

                    "body": "It was a rollercoaster. By the end they were standing on the tables outside, roars of \u201callez  les Bleus\u201d and \u201clibert\u00e9, \u00e9galit\u00e9, Mbapp\u00e9\u201d rising hoarsely into the freezing early evening air, hugging each other fiercely, cheering on their heroes.\nIt was standing room only in Le Napol\u00e9on and Le Mondial cafes, facing each other across the Rue du Faubourg-Saint-Denis in Paris\u2019s 10th arrondissement \u2013 both rammed to the rafters inside with flag-waving, face-painted, red-white-and-blue bewigged fans.\n\nFor 80 long minutes, the mood had swung from anguish to despair to fury. \u201cThey\u2019re outplaying us in every area,\u201d said Aur\u00e9lien, 28, hopping up and down on a chair in Le Napol\u00e9on. \u201cThey\u2019re just faster, neater. They want it more. It\u2019s all in the aggression.\u201d\nFrance, all in Le Mondial agreed, were playing rubbish. \u201cWe\u2019re not in it, not in it at all,\u201d said Marion Dupr\u00e9, queuing at the bar. \u201cDreadful. Incredibly disappointing.\u201d\nOutside, with 20 minutes to go, Salma and Leila were even ready to go. \u201cIt\u2019s way too cold,\u201d said Salma, 19. \u201cAnd anyway, the match is over. We\u2019ll get sandwiches at the Monoprix and find somewhere a bit quieter for a drink. What a let down.\u201d Just down the street, Le Chateau d\u2019Eau \u2013 determinedly not showing the football \u2013 began filling up\n\nThen, two-nil down to Argentina 10 minutes before the end of normal time, came a first France penalty, and an immense roar as Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 squeaked it home from the spot. Followed, barely a minute later, by an even louder howl as Bondy\u2019s idol swept home a stinging second.\n\u201cUnbelievable!\u201d cried Sylvie, 30, screeching to make herself heard and holding her head in disbelief at the back of the aptly named Mondial. \u201cThey\u2019ve woken up. They\u2019ve suddenly started playing. Look at them! Anything\u2019s possible now. It\u2019s going to happen. You wait! Allez les Bleus!\u201d\nExtra time, and slowly, surely, a badly rattled Argentina began to pull back. It was Messi, inevitably, who put them ahead. \u201cNoooon,\u201d moaned Philippe Moreau in Le Napol\u00e9on, a rare grey-headed figure among an overwhelmingly young crowd. \u201cMind you, you can\u2019t begrudge him. He is Messi.\u201d\n\nThen, truly unbelievably, the equaliser: another Mbapp\u00e9 penalty, and hope sprang once more. \u201cThey can do it, they\u2019re going to do it,\u201d whispered Magalie Potet in Le Napol\u00e9on, trying to convince herself, half-weeping, the tricolour flag painted on her cheeks smudged from emotion.\nAnd then, a crazy end-to end scramble at the end of extra time, spectacular saves from both keepers, and penalties.\n\u201cWe\u2019ll crack,\u201d said Mickael, 26, back in Le Mondial, sporting a red, white and blue beanie and his father\u2019s No 10 Zidane shirt, bought after France\u2019s 1998 win against Brazil. \u201cThere\u2019s no way this\u2019ll happen. Too many young players. They\u2019ll freeze.\u201d\nIt was prophetic. Mbapp\u00e9 scored the first, to roars loud enough to make even the few uninterested drinkers in Le Chateau d\u2019Eau look up. Messi made it one all. \u201cNow wait,\u201d said Mickael, not daring to look. \u201cIt\u2019s all going to go to shit.\u201d\nAnd it did. There weren\u2019t many tears; there was even acceptance. \u201cPenalties are always a lottery,\u201d said Karim, 40. \u201cWe can\u2019t really complain, can we? We fought, came so close, by the end we\u2019d given really everything we had. It so nearly happened. We can be proud, I think. That has to have been one of the best ever finals.\u201d\nThe Paris M\u00e9tro\u2019s hopeful gesture \u2013 the transport operator RATP temporarily rebaptised Argentine station \u201cFrance\u201d, attaching \u201callez les Bleus!\u201d signs along the platform walls, along with the legend: \u201cArgentine-France, Finale de la Coupe du Monde 2022\u201d \u2013 was for nothing.\n\nNearly 3,000 police and gendarmes were out on patrol in the capital, mainly around the Champs-Elys\u00e9es, along with nearly 12,000 more across the country, as authorities prepared for they knew not what after France\u2019s second successive World Cup final.\nThe avenue the French call \u201cthe most beautiful in the world\u201d was sealed off to traffic at both ends and its shopfronts mostly boarded up, in anticipation of tens of thousands of supporters either celebrating or drowning their sorrows.\nAn estimated 600,000 people descended on the Champs-Elys\u00e9es after France\u2019s victory over Croatia in July 2018, and before this year\u2019s final police predicted that even if France lost, up to 300,000 could be expected.\nFrom the atmosphere in Le Napoleon and Le Mondial, it didn\u2019t feel like it would be that many."

                    "body": "Pel\u00e9, who has died aged 82 after suffering from cancer, is widely regarded as the greatest footballer the game has ever seen. He was the only player to have won the World Cup three times, and perhaps the most remarkable aspect of his long career was that he reached his apotheosis so early, and on the world\u2019s biggest stage. He was 17 when he played for Brazil in the 1958 World Cup finals in Sweden, scoring six goals in their last three games \u2013 the winner in the quarter-final, a hat-trick in the semi-final and two in the final \u2013 his confidence and stature growing palpably with every game. Almost two decades later he came out of retirement and made the almost unthinkable decision of signing for New York Cosmos. For all its wealth, the US was then a pauper of the football world, and it was Pel\u00e9 who helped introduce Americans to \u201csoccer\u201d. His first game was televised in 22 countries, and the pitch, more dirt than grass, had to be spray-painted green for the watching world.  Pel\u00e9\u2019s fame began to grow almost from the moment he made his dramatic entrance in the World Cup as the youngest footballer to play in the tournament (and still the youngest to have scored a hat-trick, or to have appeared and scored in a final). Although he missed the first two games of the 1958 tournament through injury, senior members of the Brazil squad urged the manager to play both Pel\u00e9 and the right-winger Garrincha in the final group match against the Soviet Union. Unleashing these two players against the Soviets kickstarted the Brazilian campaign. Both hit the post in the first intoxicating three minutes of the match and Brazil played with a virtuosity that heralded their arrival as the dominant, irresistible force in world football.  When Brazil reached the final and beat Sweden, the hosts, 5-2, Pel\u00e9 stole the show, his two goals an illustration of the ability that set him apart from all other footballers. The first was a breathtaking piece of skill; he controlled the ball on his chest, chipped it back over his head and then ran around the flummoxed defender and volleyed it into the net. For the second, he soared above his marker before making a perfectly placed header. Pel\u00e9 was blessed with a blend of supreme athleticism, skill and tactical vision. He could run 100m in 11 seconds, shoot with either foot and outjump the tallest defenders. His sheer physicality and turn of speed were electrifying as he homed in on goal, outsprinting or simply charging through defences while managing to keep the ball under close control. But, unusually for such a prolific goalscorer, he could also be a team player. While he was still a teenager, wealthy Italian clubs attempted to lure him away from Brazil, offering a then unheard-of $1m to his club, Santos FC, for his signature. But in 1961, the Brazilian president J\u00e2nio Quadros declared Pel\u00e9 a \u201cnon-exportable national treasure\u201d, ensuring that he remained at the club for almost two decades. He was born Edson Arantes do Nascimento in the village of Tr\u00eas Cora\u00e7\u00f5es in the Brazilian state of Minas Gerais, the son of Celeste and Jo\u00e3o Ramos. The boy was named after the inventor Thomas Edison, though his parents misspelt the name. The origin of Pel\u00e9, the nickname he picked up as a young boy, is something of a mystery, but its novelty and simplicity \u2013 easy to pronounce in any language (he complained it sounded like babytalk in Portuguese) \u2013 would add to his aura as his career advanced. His father, known as Dondinho, was a gifted footballer and in the hope of a final shot at glory took the family to Bauru, a railway town in S\u00e3o Paulo state. A knee injury put an end to his sports career and the family slipped into poverty. From the age of seven, Pel\u00e9 worked part-time as a shoeshine boy. Celeste was adamant her son would not follow in Jo\u00e3o\u2019s footsteps, but by the time he was a teenager, scouts from the big clubs in Rio and S\u00e3o Paulo were knocking at the door. Waldemar de Brito, a scout and former footballer who appeared in the 1934 World Cup, finally persuaded his mother to let him have a trial for Santos. De Brito took Pel\u00e9 under his wing, and when they arrived in Santos, the port city for the booming industrial and coffee-producing state of S\u00e3o Paulo, he declared the 15-year-old was going to be \u201cthe greatest football player in the world\u201d.  Santos was a small but ambitious provincial club when Pel\u00e9 made his debut in 1956, and he was instrumental in transforming it into a national and then international force. In 1957, his first full season as a professional, in which he also won his first international cap, he was the top scorer in the S\u00e3o Paulo state championship. The following year the team scored 143 goals in 38 games to win the title, Pel\u00e9 scoring 58 times \u2013 a record that still stands \u2013 and a remarkable 75 goals in all competitions in the calendar year, a world record that stood until 1972. By the 1960s the team was one of the most successful in the world, earning the nickname the Sant\u00e1sticos as they won eight more state championships, six Brazilian championships, two Copas Libertadores (South American championships) and two Intercontinental Cups. Keen to cash in on Pel\u00e9\u2019s box office appeal \u2013 and pay his astronomical salary \u2013 Santos embarked on a relentless schedule of exhibition matches in dozens of countries across four continents. Their star attraction was contractually obliged to play everywhere they went, so by the time Pel\u00e9 appeared in his second World Cup, in Chile in 1962, he had played an exhausting 426 games and scored 488 goals in matches for club and country. He arrived with a groin injury, which flared up in Brazil\u2019s second game and ruled him out of the rest of the tournament, though Brazil, led by an inspirational Garrincha, went on to win their second successive World Cup. Worse followed four years later at the 1966 World Cup in England, when Bulgarian and Portuguese defenders repeatedly hacked Pel\u00e9 down at the knees. He limped out of the tournament and, angered at the lack of protection from referees, vowed that he had played his last World Cup. Four years later, acutely aware of his place in history and with a point to prove, he had changed his mind. Chastened, the Brazil squad trained for the tournament for three months to deal with an increasingly physical European game and the altitude and intense heat of Mexico. Pel\u00e9 was the only survivor of the victorious 1958 squad but he was joined by a new generation of gifted players, including Tost\u00e3o, Rivelino, Jairzinho, Gerson and his Santos teammate Carlos Alberto.  The 1970 World Cup was the first to be watched live by a global television audience. It was also the first to be broadcast in colour, and in the brilliant Mexican sunshine the gold shirts and cobalt blue shorts of Brazil dazzled the watching world. They won the tournament for the third time \u2013 beating Italy 4-1 in the final \u2013 by playing football of such imagination and thrilling execution that it is regarded as one of the high-water marks in the history of sport. Their swaggering, distinctly Brazilian futebol arte proved that it was possible to win by playing with joyful exuberance, and Pel\u00e9 was the most potent symbol of this sporting celebration. After 1970 he was probably the most famous man in world sport, with only Muhammad Ali as instantly recognisable and universally idolised. He played five more games for Brazil and continued with Santos for another four years, but declined to come out of international retirement for the 1974 World Cup. Brazil\u2019s manager, Mario Zagallo, had lost the nucleus of his glorious 1970 team and implored Pel\u00e9 to change his mind, but the player realised that, as well as being past his peak, he was a far more lucrative asset off the field. At this point in his life, money had become more pressing than football. As the result of bad judgment and dubious advice, he twice lost his fortune and was almost made bankrupt. One reason Santos were able to keep him for so long was their willingness to bail him out, on very favourable terms, after his business collapsed. He played his last game for the club in October 1974 but, with financial clouds still hanging over him, he came out of retirement a few months later after receiving an offer he simply could not refuse. To the astonishment of football fans, particularly in Brazil, he went to play for New York Cosmos in the fledgling North American Soccer League (NASL). They would pay him $7m for three years as a player, plus another three as a \u201cgoodwill ambassador\u201d. As well as a salary that would make him the highest-paid sportsman in the world, he was also tempted by the offer of a new challenge laid down by the Cosmos manager, Clive Toye, perhaps one that suited a footballer past his peak: \u201cI told him don\u2019t go to Italy, don\u2019t go to Spain, all you can do is win a championship. Come to the US and you can win a country.\u201d  And so it proved: Pel\u00e9 and the Cosmos were a perfect fit. The astonishing skill that had beguiled football fans in almost every country in the world was a revelation to a new American audience, and he loved the razzmatazz of the NASL \u2013 his easy charm was a gift to sports marketing men who were selling, in effect, a brand new product. Over three seasons he scored 65 goals in 111 games for the Cosmos, and led them to the 1977 American championship. The team became a huge commercial presence and regularly sold out their 60,000-seater stadium \u2013 unthinkable before his arrival. His last game came in October 1977, an exhibition match in New York between his two clubs, Santos and Cosmos, broadcast to dozens of countries, in which he played one half for each side, and scored his last goal, his 1,283rd in 1,367 games. Those figures are remarkable in themselves, but the fact that more than 500 of those games were friendlies played all over the world is testament to his popularity and box office appeal. When he retired for a second time, the winning smile and goodwill that had won over American sports fans became his stock in trade, and he went on to act as a highly paid roving ambassador for a number of organisations, from Fifa and the United Nations to Mastercard and Pepsi. He even headed a health campaign for erectile dysfunction awareness. Wherever he went, he was received like royalty.  Though never a member of a political party, he was appointed Brazil\u2019s minister of sport in 1995, serving until 1998, the year the lei Pel\u00e9 (Pele\u2019s law) was passed by congress. Its noble aim was to clean up the country\u2019s notoriously chaotic and corrupt football bodies and give greater freedom of movement to players, though the bill was watered down before and after its promulgation. In 1999 he was named athlete of the century by the International Olympic Committee (even though he had never appeared at an Olympic Games) and a year later (jointly with Diego Maradona) Fifa player of the century. He was vice-president of Santos and made honorary president of the revamped New York Cosmos in 2010. His honorary titles in many different countries included an honorary knighthood in the UK (1997). Pel\u00e9\u2019s first two marriages ended in divorce. In 2016 he married his third wife, Marcia Cibele Aoki. She survives him, along with two daughters, Kelly Cristina and Jennifer, and a son, \u00c9dson, from his first marriage, to Rosemeri Cholbi; twins, Joshua and Celeste, from his second marriage, to Ass\u00edria Lemos; and a daughter, Fl\u00e1via Kurtz, from an earlier relationship. He did not acknowledge his daughter Sandra, from a relationship with Anizia Machado, even after she won a paternity case. They never met and she died in 2006. \u2022 Pel\u00e9 (Edson Arantes do Nascimento), footballer, born 23 October 1940; died 29 December 2022"

                    "body": "Roberto Carlos did not have time to think, only to react instinctively, to do what needed to be done, what anybody would have done. As such, he does not want to be considered a hero. But that is not how Ronaldo saw it, how he continues to see it, even after all these years.\n\u201cRoberto saved my life that day,\u201d Ronaldo says, and he is talking about what happened on the afternoon of the 1998 World Cup final, which has gone down as one of the great dramas in the tournament\u2019s history, one of its great mysteries, too.\nRonaldo\u2019s soundbite is a standout moment from Brazil 2002: The Real Story, the documentary that charts the Sele\u00e7\u00e3o\u2019s fifth World Cup triumph, although there are plenty of others.\n\nThrough the dim and distant, everybody remembers the broad brushstrokes of the story: how Ronaldo suffered a seizure before the game against France in Paris and was taken to hospital for tests, which proved inconclusive. He was out of the starting lineup, then reinstated at the last before he underperformed in the shattering 3-0 defeat.\nThe life-or-death aspect for Ronaldo does not seem to have been the headline item it should have. Perhaps it once was, only to be overtaken \u2013 after it was clear that Ronaldo was perfectly fine \u2013 by all of the theories about why he began to convulse so frighteningly, teeth locked together, mouth foaming. Or maybe it never really was.\nRoberto Carlos has his memories of it. Will they ever fade? He was Ronaldo\u2019s roommate in 1998; they would always room together. In Roberto Carlos\u2019s words, they are \u201cblood brothers\u201d. But one comment he makes hits with the force of a wrecking ball. Thank goodness he was there to scream for help when Ronaldo was stricken before he went for his power nap.\n\u201cIt could have been something worse if there was not someone in the room with him,\u201d Roberto Carlos says. \u201cToday, the players don\u2019t share rooms, so \u2026\u201d\n\nRoberto Carlos is looking forward to the World Cup in Qatar, believing that Brazil have the quality and character to reach the final and, hopefully, win it for a sixth time. But it is inevitable that his mind goes back to 2002, when he was a key part of the team that beat Germany in the final in Japan, particularly as the documentary \u2013 which he watched at a screening in London at the end of September \u2013 recalls everything so vividly.\nThe 1998 final is also in his thoughts, the despair before the joy, the event that cast Brazil as avengers. It had to have been emotional for Roberto Carlos to hear Ronaldo say that he saved him.\n\u201cFor me, it was so simple to take care of Ronaldo,\u201d he says. \u201cWe were sharing a room and it was something natural, instinctive. \u2018OK, there is something happening, I need to help, to call a doctor and get the situation sorted out.\u2019 I just shouted for the doctor and the players who were in the rooms nearby, Leonardo, Edmundo \u2026\n\n\u201cFor Brazil, the World Cup is the peak for our country as a culture. When we lost in 1998, and the way that we lost, you feel like rubbish. You know that you have 200 million people who you disappoint. The camp for that tournament lasted 53 days \u2013 52 were amazing and then one day destroyed everything.\n\u201cIn 2002, we did the same things that we had done four years previously. The only difference was in the last day when we won and this changed everything.\n\u201cActually, there was another difference. We didn\u2019t allow Ronaldo to sleep on the day of the final.\u201d\nThe documentary draws on camcorder footage shot at the time by one of the squad, Juliano Belletti, the former Barcelona and Chelsea defender, and interviews with the various protagonists. There are shades of Goodfellas when some of the players are introduced, the rawness and intimacy of Belletti\u2019s material getting straight to a time and a place; a feeling, too \u2013 one of fun and friendship, song and samba beats on the team bus.\n\n\u201cWe thought that Belletti was nuts,\u201d Roberto Carlos says. \u201cEvery time he was recording, we were like: \u2018What the fuck are you doing? Stop with that! Where\u2019s our privacy?\u2019 People were making fun of him. But now we see it and we say: \u2018Thank God Belletti got all this footage for us.\u2019 We need to congratulate him because he was ahead of his time, creating spectacular content.\n\u201cI think the most important part of what Belletti captured was how you can bring together top talents to create a champion squad. It\u2019s not only the football, it\u2019s everything that happens off the pitch, as well. We were a band of brothers together.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re all still in touch, the whole squad. We have a WhatsApp group \u2013 Campe\u00f5es do Penta \u2013 and it\u2019s very active every day. One of the guys will say: \u2018Good morning,\u2019 and then the chat starts. About the Brazilian league, the Premier League, La Liga, everything. And random things, too.\u201d\nBrazil being Brazil, there was a parliamentary inquiry into the defeat in the 1998 final, which was set in train by Zinedine Zidane\u2019s two goals for France. The players \u2013 including Roberto Carlos \u2013 were called to give evidence. It was to look into alleged corruption on the part of the team sponsor, Nike, or anyone else and it came to embrace the ridiculous.\n\u201cPolitics,\u201d Roberto Carlos says, laughing. \u201cEven for us, it was a funny thing. They asked me: \u2018Why did you lose the final?\u2019 And I said: \u2018Because Zizou scored twice with his head. There\u2019s nothing else to tell you guys.\u2019 It was a circus.\u201d\nThe scene after the 2002 triumph, when Ronaldo scored both goals in the final to finesse one of the great comeback narratives, was at the other end of the spectrum. A quartet of fighter jets from the Brazilian air force arrived to escort the team plane down into Brasilia airport and Belletti zooms in on one of the pilots, who waves back. There is then a message from the squadron that is patched in over the intercom. \u201cGetting over the odds,\u201d the voice crackles. \u201cWelcome home \u2026 five-time world champions.\u201d Try watching that with dry eyes.\n\u201cIt\u2019s very rare that fighter jets follow a plane,\u201d Roberto Carlos says. \u201cUsually it\u2019s for the president of a country, so at that moment we started to realise how important it was for the country, all the meaning of that title. It was extremely emotional and watching the documentary brought it all back.\n\u201cCan I comprehend what we did in 2002? Honestly no, not yet. Football is wonderful and that was a one-of-a-kind moment for me. I just hope that Brazil can win in Qatar and all of us can have that feeling again.\u201d\nTite\u2019s squad are the favourites with many bookmakers and when Roberto Carlos runs through the players he expects to make the difference \u2013 many of them high-calibre attackers \u2013 it is apparent why.\n\u201cThiago Silva, Neymar, Vin\u00edcius J\u00fanior, Rodrygo, Casemiro, Raphinha, Pedro,\u201d he says, and he could have added Gabriel Jesus, Anthony, Gabriel Martinelli and Richarlison. \u201cPedro is a player who helped a lot for Flamengo when they won the Copa Libertadores last month. He plays as a typical No 9, the guy inside the box, and we don\u2019t have many of this kind of player at the moment. With a good goalkeeper and a good striker, we have a chance. Alisson, for me, is one of the best goalkeepers in the world.\n\u201cWith Neymar, the most important thing is that he doesn\u2019t care or pay any attention to what people say about him away from the pitch. He has to give his best and that\u2019s it. If he wins, he will be the best. If he loses, then the critics come. He has to accept that this is football.\u201d\n\nRoberto Carlos works these days as an ambassador for Real Madrid \u2013 the club where he won four league titles and three Champions League trophies \u2013 and also for the Fifa Legends programme. \u201cI\u2019m working more than when I used to play,\u201d he says, with a smile. Seriously? \u201cVery seriously.\u201d\nWhat he wants to see in the coming weeks is a Brazil team that embraces its destiny. The wait for a sixth star on their shirts has been too long.\n\u201cWhen Brazil play a World Cup, they have to be in the final,\u201d Roberto Carlos says. \u201cThis squad has great players and I believe they can get there. Brazil have five stars on their shirt so the weight of it is always the same. It\u2019s about who has the balls to wear the yellow shirt. All of these players do.\u201d"

                    "body": "This was the biggest game of women\u2019s rugby ever played and, somehow, it exceeded even that lofty billing. New Zealand are the Rugby World Cup champions but only after a quite stunning contest that demonstrated why the tournament has captured the imaginations of so many. England will feel bereft but they played a full part in perhaps the best World Cup final in history.\nIt was also the Red Roses\u2019 worst nightmare. This was a second chastening defeat to the Black Ferns in consecutive World Cup finals and their first defeat to anyone in 31 Tests. They were 14-0 up and cruising in the first quarter, only to be reduced to 14 players after a red card was shown to the winger Lydia Thompson for a high challenge on the outstanding Portia Woodman. In that misjudged split second, everything changed.\nEven deep into the final moments, however, one final shot at redemption remained. England, having been awarded a penalty, opted for one last lineout five metres out. For weeks their driving maul has been all but unstoppable and the stage was set. When it mattered most, though, the ball ended up in grateful Kiwi hands and the defending champions were safe.\n\nGiven England have had the benefit of full-time contracts for longer than any of their rivals, it must also rank as one of the great coaching heists. When Wayne Smith took over earlier this year, the Black Ferns were in disarray after a coruscating review into the treatment of the players by the previous regime. Smith simply told his players to go out and play with freedom and joy. The rest is history.\nA world-record crowd of 42,579 for a women\u2019s fixture added further resonance to an occasion which had everything. Neither side really deserved to lose but New Zealand\u2019s sixth try of the night with eight minutes left, scored by the replacement wing Ayesha Leti-I\u2019iga after a world-class offload from the centre Stacey Fluhler, was something special.\n\nIt boiled down to a classic clash of styles, particularly after Thompson\u2019s departure. For the most part England\u2019s set piece and driving maul were outstanding, with the hooker Amy Cokayne collecting a close-range hat-trick, but the Black Ferns backs were also an ever-present threat. On a clear, dry day, it made for glorious entertainment and maintained the feelgood theme of the past few weeks. Clearly it helped to have the host nation in the final but people have also genuinely enjoyed what they have been watching.\nHow England will wish they could have rewound the tape and given New Zealand fewer chances to run at them. Even before kick-off there were tricky issues to address, with their starting scrum-half Leanne Infante ruled out on the eve of the game with knee and ankle issues. In came the relatively inexperienced Lucy Packer, capped on just eight previous occasions, for the biggest game of her young life.\nThe Red Roses, however, enjoyed the perfect start, having also come up with a smart response to the haka, spreading right the way along the 10-metre line in a wall of white. Barely three minutes had elapsed when, courtesy of an effective counter-ruck, they engineered space out wide and the full-back Ellie Kildunne finished coolly in the corner. Even more ominously England\u2019s renowned maul was starting to rumble, with Cokayne completing a perfectly executed driven score to make it 14-0 in as many minutes.\n\nThere could be no argument, though, about Thompson\u2019s dismissal after she caught the unfortunate Woodman full in the face as New Zealand attacked down the left. It was a particularly sad exit for Woodman, one of the free-running stars of the women\u2019s game, but it also offered New Zealand a chance to change the mood music.\nSure enough they had their first try on the board almost immediately through Georgia Ponsonby before Woodman\u2019s replacement, Leti-I\u2019iga, closed the gap further. Under the tutelage of Smith and his fellow former All Black gurus Sir Graham Henry and Mike Cron, the Black Ferns were being true to their word and giving it a crack.\nEven then, though, England held the advantage through Marlie Packer and the relentless Cokayne but the early loss of Zoe Aldcroft remained a slight concern. Could New Zealand respond again? The answer was yes, with another close-quarters score for the prop Amy Rule narrowing the half-time gap to a single score once more.\n\nWithin 30 seconds of the restart a thrilling breakout ended with Fluhler running a perfect support line to complete a try to grace any final. Then, within four minutes of coming on, the replacement front-rower Krystal Murray crashed over in the left corner to put her side ahead for the first time. Their advantage did not last long, with yet another maul giving Cokayne the chance to complete her hat-trick, but the best was yet to come.\nThe referee, Hollie Davidson, also deserved significant praise. Regardless of the outcome this tournament has felt like a coming of age for the women\u2019s game in multiple respects, both in Aotearoa and farther afield. Once again, though, it is New Zealand who reign supreme."

                    "body": "The former South Africa assistant coach Gary Gold will step down as head coach of the US Eagles, USA Rugby said on Friday, three weeks after the team failed to qualify for the 2023 Rugby World Cup in France.  In a statement, Ross Young, chief executive of USA Rugby, thanked Gold \u201cfor his dedication, passion and service\u201d. \u201cHe has brought home the most successful record of any previous coach and helped carry the team to its highest ever World Rugby ranking, of 12 in 2018. The passion Gary has for this program is unquestioned and we will always appreciate it.\u201d Gold was on the South Africa staff when the Springboks won the World Cup in 2007 and then coached in the top flight in England. He said: \u201cIt has been a privilege to work with the amazing playing group at USA Rugby over the past five years, and I want to commend the players and the unbelievable effort they made in trying to qualify for the 2023 Rugby World Cup. \u201cUnfortunately, even though we didn\u2019t lose a game in the final qualification tournament, we did not get the outcome we wanted.\u201d The USA played in Dubai after beating Canada but losing qualifiers to Uruguay and Chile. They won their first two games in the qualification tournament, against Kenya and Hong Kong, but failed to reach France after drawing with Portugal, who had run up a better points differential in their first two games. The US have only missed the World Cup once before, in 1995. Their absence from France next year will be a blow for World Rugby, which has placed a bet on American rugby, with the award of hosting rights for the men in 2031 and the women two years later. Reports have linked Eddie Jones, the newly fired England coach, with an eight-year deal in the US, to get the men\u2019s team in shape for hosting the World Cup. Sources within the US game have indicated to the Guardian there is no plan to bring in Jones. On Friday, Young said: \u201cThe future structure and support systems for the men\u2019s Eagles will go through reform as the organization embarks on a complete review of our high-performance programs. With us now not participating in France next year it will give us the opportunity to start implementing some of those sooner than anticipated.\u201d USA Rugby said Gold would \u201cremain at hand in the short term and support the review\u201d.  Gold oversaw the Eagles\u2019 first and only win over a tier-one nation, against Scotland in Houston in 2018. That was the first year of Major League Rugby, the professional domestic men\u2019s competition that is now gearing up for its sixth season but which recently lost two teams.  Gold said: \u201cI believe the Eagles can be very successful, but it will need an objective review of the systems and structures because having the group play a total of nine Tests in two years is not conducive to building the cohesion required to climb the world rankings. \u201cI fully support the wider review process that has been initiated. Having said that, one of the things I believe about leadership is that the position comes with accountability for outcomes, and I feel that I need to take responsibility for the fact that we haven\u2019t qualified. \u201cTo that end, I am going to step away from the role of USA Eagles head coach at the end of the year. I really want to apologize to the USA rugby public, the stakeholders, staff and everyone who supported us \u2026 As much as I am bitterly disappointed at the end result, we gave it our best shot.\u201d"

Key quotes of 2022 \u201cI was quite confident we were on the right track, leading up to the World Cup. And I still have that belief. But if others don\u2019t share that, then that\u2019s their decision.\u201d Eddie Jones, now former coach of England.  \u201cWe are encouraged by the solid progress the team has made during this Six Nations \u2026\u201d RFU statement in March. Eddie Jones was sacked in December. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be here doing the job unless I thought we were capable of winning things.\u201d Warren Gatland on his return as head coach of Wales. \u201cHe has been a success at Racing, Crusaders and now La Rochelle. It is not an accident \u2026 if he has his mind set on something then he will achieve it.\u201d La Rochelle assistant coach Donnacha Ryan hails Ronan O\u2019Gara\u2019s impact on the new European champions. \u201cI want to make sure this doesn\u2019t happen to those still in the game. We want to make sure we\u2019re the only generation of players this happens to.\u201d The 44-year-old former England hooker Steve Thompson, whose early-onset dementia has left him unable to recall winning the 2003 World Cup. \u201cI was definitely dead. I died twice. My doctors said I had a 1% chance of surviving. God saved me. I now live differently. I don\u2019t worry about small or stupid things which I thought were important before.\u201d Georgia\u2019s head coach, Levan Maisashvili, reflecting on his survival after contracting Covid-19 in South Africa in 2021.  \u201cThat was the most phenomenal rugby moment of my life, standing out there and hearing that crowd chanting the names of these girls.\u201d Wayne Smith on coaching theBlack Ferns to their World Cup win. \u201cWe don\u2019t need that in the game and I\u2019d have thought he\u2019d have learned his lesson by now, if it is him doing this.\u201d Nigel Owens offers his verdict on Rassie Erasmus\u2019s online comments about refereeing decisions. \u201cI think the rolling maul has got out of hand, personally. Perhaps in England the number of spectators looks after itself because of the size of the population but in this part of the world it doesn\u2019t. I think it\u2019s a part of the game we could look at and say: \u2018Can we make this a greater contest?\u2019\u201d Former All Black head coach Graham Henry. \u201cWe thought we could turn the tanker around but it\u2019s ended up like the Titanic, sadly. The ship has sunk, the captains are nowhere to be seen.\u201d Financially stricken Worcester\u2019s director of rugby, Steve Diamond. \u201cRugby is football\u2019s little brother, reaching up to the table to try and grab some food. In order to do that you have to make a constant effort to do more. I might be wrong but I\u2019m not sure if rugby is doing that.\u201d Maro Itoje on the need for rugby union to market itself better. \u201cThey stand there almost like little schoolboys going: \u2018Er, um \u2026\u2019 I just say: \u2018Call me Sir.\u2019 I really don\u2019t mind.\u201d Sara Cox (top female referee). Three wishes for 2023 1) A wonderful men\u2019s Rugby World Cup. The sport as a whole badly needs one. 2) More help and support for former players suffering from the symptoms of early onset dementia. 3) Greater success for teams prepared to run the ball from their own half. And finally \u2026 many thanks to subscribers and readers who have followed our rugby coverage in the Guardian and the Observer. Wishing you all a happy new year and see you back here in 2023."

One policeman fell off his horse in the disturbances.\nOrganisers later blamed the trouble on hundreds of ticketless fans, who they said had tried to force their way into Al Rayyan\u2019s Education City stadium. However others who were caught in the melee insisted they had legitimate tickets \u2013 and feared they could have got seriously hurt.\n\nIn one clip on social media a woman wearing Spanish colours but speaking with an English accent warned police there was a baby in the crowd. \u201cThey\u2019re going to get trampled, there\u2019s too many people,\u201d she said.\nOther footage showed police in riot gear pushing and shoving fans \u2013 crushing them up against a fence \u2013 as well as fights breaking out.\nMorocco will play Portugal in the quarter-finals \u2013 and could play England in the semi-finals next week if both teams get through.\nSources close to the organisers told the Guardian that they had deployed extra security measures \u2013 which included soft ticket checks and a far larger police presence \u2013 because they had expected Morocco fans without tickets to try to get in.\nLong before kick-off, multiple checkpoints were set up outside the metro station, with fans asked to show their tickets at each stage. With 20 minutes remaining, however, police blocked the main entrance amid fears that fans without tickets were trying to barge through.\nSome people showed their phones and what appeared to be their passports but were turned away. It was unclear how many people outside the stadium had tickets and how many did not.\nThe atmosphere outside the stadium did eventually calm down with groups of fans watching the game on mobile phones after shuffling away from the perimeter gate. Despite a large number of empty seats before kick\u2011off it was later announced as a sell-out with a full capacity of 44,667.\n\nThis is not the first time there has been issues involving Morocco\u2019s fans at this World Cup. There was also pushing before the team\u2019s last group match against Canada, with some fans also trying to climb a fence.\nA statement from Qatari organisers said: \u201cA number of unticketed supporters gathered outside the Education City Stadium ahead of the Morocco v Spain match in an attempt to gain access to the stadium. \u2018Soft\u2019 ticket checks had been established some distance from the stadium perimeter to prevent groups crowding stadium access points.\nDespite this, a small group of fans were able to approach the stadium fence and were quickly dispersed by tournament security forces on the ground, with no injuries or further issues reported.\n\u201cFans were redirected to the local free fan zone where the match was being aired. Ensuring the safety and security of every fan is of paramount importance and all decisions taken are directed towards this aim.\u201d"

                    "body": "Morocco are through to the last 16 of the World Cup for the second time after early goals from Hakim Ziyech and Youssef En-Nesyri brushed aside whatever suspense remained of their progress. It sealed a nightmarish exit to a tournament for Canada that began with so much promise eight nights ago.\nThe mighty Atlas Lions entered the group-stage finale full of confidence, having followed a cagey goalless draw with Croatia with an emphatic 2-0 win over second-ranked Belgium and needing only a point to book a place in the knockout stage for the first time in nearly four decades. They finished it, owing to Croatia\u2019s draw with Belgium across town, the improbable winners of a group above of a pair of European giants fresh off runs to the last four in 2018.\n\n\u201cWe said we wanted to give everything we\u2019ve got to get out of the group stages,\u201d said Walid Regragui, who was appointed Morocco\u2019s manager three months ago. \u201cWe can tick that box now. So why not aim for the sky?\n\u201cWe needed to change and we needed to change our mentality. We\u2019re not going to stop here. We\u2019ve got a lot of respect for all of the different opponents, but we are going to be a very difficult team to beat.\u201d\nLes Rouges, who were picked apart by Croatia and eliminated from the competition despite outplaying Belgium in their opener, appeared out of sorts from the start here in a hostile atmosphere with the crowd jeering their every touch.\nMorocco needed four minutes to send their supporters into delirium as Steven Vit\u00f3ria\u2019s undercooked backpass to Milan Borjan forced the goalkeeper to dash from his penalty area with En-Nesyri closing in. A harried Borjan played it directly to the Chelsea winger Ziyech, who chipped in from 35 yards and ignited the mass of red packed into the stadium\u2019s south end. It was the howler of the tournament and surely the nadir of Canada\u2019s first World Cup appearance since their largely forgettable debut in 1986.\nCanada were able to get their feet under them but failed to generate a meaningful threat from their possession and set-pieces and it was not long before Morocco were bossing the midfield again. They doubled their lead after 23 minutes through En-Nesyri, when the Sevilla striker chased down a long ball from the back, darted between a pair of defenders and beat Borjan at his near post to become the first Moroccan to score in two World Cups.\nThere were remnants from Canada of the pace and industry that powered their swaggering performance against Belgium, but they were constantly done in by lack of organisation from front to back, unable to string together more than a few passes or long stretches of the first half. Their woes were embodied by an inability to get Alphonso Davies involved as the 22-year-old was constantly denied service by Morocco\u2019s swarming defenders.\n\nThe Moroccans, behind a well-drilled backline marshalled by Paris Saint-Germain\u2019s Achraf Hakimi, were one of two teams left in the competition, along with Brazil, who had yet to concede. But Canada pulled one back five minutes before half-time when Nayef Aguerd blocked a cross from the left past his keeper inside the near post, the first own goal of the tournament and a cruel end to Morocco\u2019s run of six successive clean sheets.\n\nWith nothing left to play for but the chance to end their tournament on a high note and set a winning tone for when they co-host four years from now, Canada\u2019s fighting spirit shone through during the second half as John Herdman \u2013 their manager from Consett in County Durham \u2013 made a triple substitution after an hour and threw numbers forward with abandon.\nThey came agonisingly close to an equaliser when a header by the ageless captain, Atiba Hutchinson \u2013 the oldest outfield player in Qatar \u2013 rattled the bar and caromed down on the goalline. But Morocco\u2019s rigid backline refused to budge, ensuring Africa\u2019s record sixth win at a World Cup while becoming the first team from the continent to take first place in a group since Nigeria in 1998.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve raised our bar finishing top of Concacaf and I thought that was a good standard to bring in,\u201d Herdman said. \u201cWe always said the world level is the next level and I don\u2019t think we were far off.\n\u201cTwo inches tonight. Two inches from getting our first result. That\u2019s all it was.\u201d"

                    "body": "Eva Kaili, the Greek member of the European parliament at the centre of a cash for influence scandal implicating Qatar, will remain in jail pending trial, a Belgian court has decided. \u201cIn its order this morning, the pre-council chamber extended the pre-trial detention of EK by one month,\u201d said a statement from the Belgian federal prosecutor\u2019s office. If Kaili chooses to appeal against the decision within 24 hours, she will appear before a chamber at the Brussels court of appeal within 15 days. Earlier in the day, her legal team requested the MEP\u2019s release under electronic tag. Her lawyer, Andr\u00e9 Risopoulos, said she was fully cooperating with the investigation and denied all charges against her.  Kaili is one of four people who have been charged with corruption and money laundering in the case. Investigators have seized nearly \u20ac1.5m (\u00a31.3m) in cash from various Brussels properties, including \u20ac150,000 from her apartment. The other four suspects are Kaili\u2019s partner, European parliament assistant, Francesco Giorgi, former Italian MEP Pier Antonio Panzeri, and the head of an NGO, Niccol\u00f2 Fig\u00e0-Talamanca. Fig\u00e0-Talamanca\u2019s family have denied all charges against him. Giorgi has been reported by Belgian and Italian media to have confessed and sought to exonerate his partner. He did not respond to a message sent to his phone. Investigators believe Panzeri, an MEP from 2004 to 19, is a pivotal figure in the criminal network, who took bribes from Qatar and Morocco. About \u20ac600,000 was found at his Brussels home during police raids earlier this month. A lawyer for Panzeri has not commented on the charges, Reuters reported. Another of Kaili\u2019s lawyers, Michalis Dimitrakopoulos, told the press she had been \u201cbetrayed\u201d by her partner, the father of her child. According to a leaked document from the investigation cited in Le Soir, Kaili has admitted she knew that suitcases of cash passed through the apartment she shared with Giorgi. According to the document, when he was arrested just outside their flat on 9 December, the former TV news anchor panicked and asked her father, who was visiting Brussels, to hide the money. Kaili\u2019s father was arrested that morning attempting to leave the Sofitel hotel in the EU quarter with a suitcase stuffed with \u20ac750,000 in notes. He was released the same day without charge. Risopoulos said he was scandalised about the leak of investigation documents and said he had never seen such \u201cfrontal violations\u201d of confidentiality. Meanwhile, Greek authorities, conducting a parallel investigation, announced they had taken possession of a prime plot of land that the MEP and her partner recently bought on the Aegean island of Paros. The confiscation was ordered by Charalambos Vourliotis, a former supreme court judge who heads the country\u2019s anti-laundering authority, following \u201cconcrete signs\u201d of financial impropriety, according to well-placed sources. Authorities seized the asset after a financial prosecutor found evidence of money laundering in the purchase of the property, a large sea view plot in one of the popular island\u2019s most sought after spots. The deposits of a joint bank account in the name of the couple were also confiscated, with officials implying the account had been used to launder money. Dimitrakopoulos has insisted the land was bought with her MEP earnings. \u201cThey wanted a house to stay when they came in the summer,\u201d Vazaios Petropoulos, the couple\u2019s French-trained architect told state TV. \u201cThe plan was to have a house for the family.\u201d The MEP\u2019s other assets in Greece have already been frozen and last week she was stripped of her role as one of the European parliament\u2019s 14 vice-presidents. Kaili will be tried in Belgium first, but will also face trial in Greece if the investigation currently under way finds proof of money laundering, with widespread reports that if she is found guilty she could face up to 15 years in prison. The scandal has shaken the European parliament and prompted questions about the activities of other EU figures. On Wednesday, the European Commission said it would write to former EU commissioner Dimitris Avramopoulos \u201cto obtain further information\u201d about how he represented an NGO implicated in the scandal during a cooling off period after he left office. Avramopoulos, who was in charge of EU policy on home affairs and migration until 2019, has said he was paid \u20ac60,000 for one year as an honorary board member of the Brussels NGO Fight Impunity, a campaign group founded by Panzeri. The former commissioner announced last week he was resigning from the board of Fight Impunity, along with other high-profile figures, including former French prime minister Bernard Cazeneuve, and a previous EU foreign policy chief, Federica Mogherini. In a statement to Greek news agency AMNA, Avramopoulos said he was paid \u20ac5,000 a month from the NGO for one year from February 2021, which was declared and taxed in Greece. He said he had asked for the payments to end after one year, as the NGO\u2019s activity had \u201cgreatly declined\u201d.  Avramopoulos was cleared to work for Fight Impunity in December 2020 by a Brussels panel, as long as he did not lobby EU commissioners during his two-year cooling-off period. Earlier this week the euobserver website reported Avramopoulos had met several EU commissioners while on the Fight Impunity payroll. The commission\u2019s chief spokesperson said these were \u201cshort courtesy meetings\u201d with former colleagues and his successor, and that Avramopoulos had not represented Fight Impunity or discussed \u201csuch issues\u201d. Nevertheless the commission has said it would write to the former commissioner \u201cto obtain further information to see how he respected the conditions in his post-mandate activity and how he represented this NGO during this period between the date of authorisation and the end of the cooling off period\u201d."

                    "body": "Welcome, once again, to the upside down. As the Premier League enters its third season of cut-and-shut schedules, relegated again to an insistent voice at the edge of larger things, it is tempting to wonder exactly when this state of flux is going to end; at what point the self-proclaimed world\u2019s most important league will ever find its way back from the dark place. Or, indeed, if things will ever quite be the same again.\nIt has, let\u2019s face it, been three years now. A competition that predicates its existence on hogging the foreground, on being not the B-flick or the short but the Premier, will once again find itself frazzled by some truly mind-boggling logistics.\nIn common with every other league, and indeed every other life, the last time the English top tier was able to contemplate an unclouded future was the pre-Covid lull of early 2020. The years since have brought a total shutdown, a summer half-life, a Super League insurrection, a winter of firebreak talk and cancelled dates and the enforced sale of one of its defining member clubs.\n\nNeedless to say this is all deeply off-brand. More than any other competition the Premier League voice is all about control and certainty, about days and weeks \u2013 Super Sundays, Monday Nights, a complete televisual white-out from September to May \u2013 dominated by that in-house tone of homogenised triumphalism. Like it or not, that voice has become a little wrung-out, the matinee idol presence a little stretched, bow tie askew, clinging to the balustrade.\nAs the league kicks into gear on Friday at Selhurst Park it is worth taking a moment to appreciate exactly how this thing is going to play out from here. Welcome to the season with a hole in it, 10 months during which the entire calendar must remain spinning in place, like a flywheel detached from its gears, while an enforced winter World Cup plays out. Stranger things have happened in the past three years of dissolution, but this is going to stretch everyone involved to their outer limits.\nThe first instalment, which we might call block 1, extends from 6 August to 17 September, a run of eight Premier League games and two Champions League rounds. After that we have two quick-fire international friendlies, the last warmups before Qatar.\n\nThis is followed by block 3 from 1 October to 5 November, eight more league games and four more in the Champions League. Block 4 is the World Cup itself, a quick change to Arabian Standard Time and a maximum of seven matches between 21 November and 18 December. Then it\u2019s back to the northern winter and Block 5, three Premier League games in a week from Boxing Day to 2 January. At which point the season is free to emerge gasping and wheezing, clinging to the nearest rock, and wondering exactly what just happened.\n\nThere will be breakages along the way, and contortions to the robustness of the season. Take, for example, Harry Kane, who tends to play every game he can, as well as some he can\u2019t. In the next five months Kane could feature in up to 34 matches under three different world orders \u2013 Premier League, Uefa, Fifa \u2013 crisscrossing the UK, mainland Europe and the Gulf. There will, of course, be teams of analysts studying how to peak through this period, when to rest those red-zoning muscles fibres. But there are also endless unintended consequences.\nEngland\u2019s provisional World Cup squad is due to be announced on 21 October, with three league games and two in the Champions League still to play. This has never happened before, the league season skewed like this by outside pressures. How will it affect players and selections? Are you really going to give 200% over 94 minutes against Wolves away if your knee has started to click and the Qatar 2022 final squad date is three days away?\n\nThe same goes for after the World Cup. Players discharged in the first 10 days will be thrumming up through the gears for the restart. Lose a semi-final and there will be some broken souls coming back to take up the slack. Last season Mohamed Salah scored 23 in 26 before the African Nations Cup, and eight in 28 afterwards. Never mind Covid. Never mind the post-World Cup transfer madness coming to mid-season for the first time. This already looks like the most fevered of times.\nIt should be a source of unrest too. Part of the great public uprising last summer was the idea the European Super League would destroy the structures of the domestic season. Take a look at the shockwaves from Qatar 2022 and it seems pretty clear the same forces in another guise \u2013 the greed of nation-state football, as opposed to the greed of the cartel clubs \u2013 have achieved the same thing from a different angle.\nAnd while there is currently nothing in place to prevent next season becoming a return, four years on, to untroubled waters it is easy to feel a little sceptical. Another Super League brouhaha, another act of force majeure, some other ripple, some other break. Time continues to pass. It seems a reasonable question. Have we already seen the best of this thing?\nThis is perhaps an unduly doom-laden, fin-de-si\u00e8cle view. There is still a vast hunger for Premier League product, and a ringfenced broadcast income. Even during the in-between years the standard and the level of interest has remained remarkably high. But looking forward to what might actually happen, there are still some notes of unease.\n\nOn one hand the Premier League field seems strong as ever. On the other Spurs have spent large parts of the summer as third favourites to win it. The change of ownership at Chelsea has thinned the field, in a league where Manchester City\u2019s title dominance is in danger of becoming a little humdrum for the neutral.\nThe Premier League is, we hear (most often from the Premier League) never stale and never staid. Perhaps the new season can present us with something genuinely valuable, if not new champions then new challengers, a bolter from the pack energised by these outside forces.\nIt still seems odd to suggest a Manchester United revival might make for an appealing underdog story, although Erik ten Hag\u2019s early clarity has already been undermined by a familiar whiff of rotten, celebrified club culture. Arsenal have recruited well but remain, in the end, Arsenal. Perhaps a team with fewer World Cup players, Aston Villa or Crystal Palace or Brighton, might make a genuine play for the top four.\nOtherwise Liverpool will still be very strong. City will be challenged by an intriguing tactical retread around that startling new presence up front. But they will also benefit from the World Cup break: the Pep-Erling interface is likely to be defined by some furious work over those few weeks.\n\nAt the other end it is hard to look past at least two promoted clubs struggling, and some further oscillation from Everton, as well as Leeds who are hard to call either way.\nBeyond this we can enjoy the benefits of five substitutes being used, and some younger refereeing appointments. Plus, in a note of reassuring normality, there is once again a new ball. The Nike Flight is basically the same as the previous ball. That AerowSculpt technology is still \u201cgiving a truer flight\u201d. But the ball will also carry markings that hark back to the first ever Premier League ball in 1992.\nIt feels like an oddly calming note of nostalgia in strange times. Keep moving forward. This too will pass. But not without another season of living dangerously."

Now they are out in the streets in the city of Sanandaj and celebrate the loss of their football team against US.\u201d She also posted a video of fireworks being let off in Saqqez, Mahsa Amini\u2019s home town.\n\nIn 2019, Iranian women were allowed to enter a football stadium for the first time in 40 years, but have been permitted to attend only a handful of national matches since, according to Al Jazeera.\n\u201cThe Islamic Republic banned women from entering stadiums for 40 years and now people are chanting \u2018woman, life, freedom\u2019 to celebrate being booted out of the World Cup,\u201d Alinejad wrote above a video from Kermanshah in western Iran.\n\nIranians also celebrated in Marivan, which was among the cities in western Iran\u2019s Kurdish-populated regions where, on 21 November, security forces intensified a crackdown that killed a dozen people over 24 hours, directly shooting at protesters and using heavy weapons, rights groups said.\n\nThere were also celebrations in Tehran and Sanandaj, Kurdistan\u2019s capital.\n\n\nThe celebrations came after fans outside the stadium in Doha sought to highlight the protests and the Iranian government\u2019s crackdown. \u201cEverybody should know about this. We don\u2019t have voice in Iran,\u201d an Iranian living in the US, who gave his name only as Sam, told Reuters. \nSpeaking by phone from Tehran shortly before kick-off, 21-year-old Elham said she wanted the US to win because victory for the national squad, known as Team Melli, would be a gift for Iranian authorities. \u201cThis is not my national team. It is not the Melli team, it is the mullahs\u2019 team,\u201d she said.\nExtra security personnel, some mounted on horseback, patrolled outside the Al Thumama Stadium in Doha before the match, while guards at the perimeter made Iranians unfurl their flags before entering. Police were stationed throughout the stadium alongside regular security guards. Some carried batons.\nEarly in the second half, a group of fans briefly held up letters spelling Mahsa Amini\u2019s name, to applause from Iranian supporters around them. Security personnel took their signs but allowed them to remain in their seats.\n\nUnder pressure to publicly support protesters at home, the Iranian team declined to sing the national anthem in their first game against England, which they lost 6-2. But they sang it before the second game, a 2-0 victory over Wales, and again on Tuesday. When Iran lost to England, there were celebrations in Tehran too.\nOutside the stadium after the match, Reuters journalists saw security chase two people in a series of scuffles on the ground\u2019s perimeter. Three guards pinned one man to the ground, who was wearing a T-shirt emblazoned with the words \u201cwoman, life, freedom\u201d, the central slogan of the Iranian protest movement.\nThe man repeatedly yelled \u201cwoman, life, freedom\u201d as guards were on top of him. A witness told Reuters the altercation began when guards attempted to remove the man\u2019s shirt.\nIn the second half of the match, five members of the Russian activist punk group Pussy Riot stood in the stadium stands wearing green balaclavas and T-shirts that read \u201cwoman, life, freedom\u201d. On the back, the shirts carried the names of people killed in Iran, along with their ages, Nika Nikulshina, a group member, told Reuters.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s our gesture of support for Iranian women and we want to highlight that Iran is sending drones to Russia to kill Ukraine. We want to remind everyone that there is not only Fifa and fun, and that there\u2019s a war going on,\u201d she said.\nStadium security removed the balaclavas and after the match, \u201cpolitely\u201d escorted the women out of the stadium, said Nikulshina, who invaded the pitch in 2018 during the World Cup final in Moscow."

                    "body": "It\u2019s been 64 long years since Wales last appeared at the men\u2019s World Cup but they are going to Qatar in November. Wales have attempted to qualify for every World Cup since 1950, making their only appearance in 1958. Back then, dreams of victory were ruined after eventual winners Brazil \u2013 specifically a 17-year-old Pel\u00e9 \u2013 knocked them out in the quarter-finals. There have been some painful near-misses since, but Wales are finally back at the World Cup finals after beating Ukraine 1-0 last Sunday in Cardiff. Guardian readers who have followed the team through thick and thin share their reactions. \u2018It\u2019s a fairytale\u2019 It is something I thought I would never see. It\u2019s just wonderful. I grew up watching a very good side that beat then-world champions Germany and Brazil. I did not realise that, for over 20 years, that was as good as it would get. More pain arrived in 2004 under Mark Hughes. Then John Toshack came in and blooded a lot of youngsters \u2013 many of whom are now mainstays in this side, including a young Gareth Bale. The late, great Gary Speed came in as manager after Toshack. He modernised the setup, pushed for better facilities and created a club environment. Chris Coleman was next and he led us to Euro 2016, our first major tournament for 58 years. We reached the semi-final and lost only to eventual winners Portugal. We had another brilliant showing at Euro 2020 and now this. It\u2019s a fairytale. Andrew, 41, civil servant, Swansea \u2018I shed a few tears\u2019  I have been watching Wales home and away since I was about 14 and we have been through plenty of lows. I\u2019ve seen us come close to qualifying several times only to experience heartbreak. I was lucky enough to go to every game at Euro 2016, which exorcised many of those demons, but I still couldn\u2019t truly believe we were going to a World Cup until the final whistle \u2013 and I have to admit that I shed a few tears. I am so proud of this team. It is ridiculous that the World Cup is in Qatar, but I am desperate to be there for our first appearance in my lifetime. I\u2019m just waiting for the Wales FA\u2019s ticket allocation to go on sale. Russell, 46, Kent \u2018Qualifying is a huge change\u2019  After the perennial troubles of the team in my youth, it\u2019s great to see them qualify for major tournaments but the feelings are subdued by the nature of the opposition in the playoff. Even as a Welshman I would have been pleased to see Ukraine win. In my teens I was used to Wales competing with Northern Ireland for last place in the old Home championship, so qualifying for the World Cup is a huge change. The fact the finals are taking place in a country with a dubious human rights record and in a part of the world that is unsuited to top level sport confirms the complete corrupt mess that is professional football. Alan, 66, retired hospital pharmacist, Spain \u2018This is the best ever time to be a Wales fan\u2019  Having moved to Cardiff in 2012, my first game was a dire 0-0 against the Republic of Ireland in a friendly. Going from that to watching us qualify for three tournaments and winning our Nations League group has been amazing. \u200b\u200bAlthough this is probably the best ever time to be a Wales fan, I am cautious about the future, knowing this may be the last we see of Gareth Bale and other players, but I am pleased with the talent coming through. I have to thank the Welsh half of my family for drilling my Welshness into me when I was growing up in Birmingham. James, 35, civil servant, Cardiff \u2018I\u2019m happy for my father, who remembers 1958\u2019  I grew up supporting the teams of the 1980s and there was a feeling we deserved better. It always seemed there was some last-minute injustice or bad luck to stop us from qualifying for things: the dodgy referee in the 1976 European Championship against Yugoslavia, the Joe Jordan handball decision against Scotland in the 1978 World Cup, the Iceland game in the 1982 World Cup when Wales were winning but failed to qualify on goal difference. We saw the other Home Nations qualifying, while we felt we were just as good if not better. I\u2019m happy for my father, who is in his eighties and still talks passionately about the last time Wales qualified for a World Cup in 1958. It\u2019s great he will finally be able to have new, happier memories to reflect on. Gina, 47, university academic manager, Edinburgh \u2018It\u2019s been an absolute joy to watch this team\u2019 After many heartbreaks, it\u2019s been an absolute joy to watch this team over the last decade. To see Wales get the unexpected results borne out of friendship, camaraderie, skill, fun and hard work fills me with a goose-pimpled pride to be Welsh. My mind always goes to Gary Speed when this brilliantly close squad exceeds expectations. He reshaped the nation\u2019s view of our football team by bringing pride back into wearing the red jersey. It would be a once in a lifetime trip to see Wales in Qatar but, given the hugely important issues of reported human rights abuses, I\u2019ll be watching from the comfort of my own fanpark in Cardiff. Wayne, 39, Rhoose Wales would tease us by almost qualifying  I never thought this would happen in my lifetime. I cried and cried when Paul Bodin missed that penalty, and watched the 1994 World Cup with sadness, despairing at what could have been. Wales would tease us by almost qualifying or winning against a world class team (such as West Germany after they had won the World Cup), only to be beaten by a team we should have beaten a hundred times over. Finally, we have a team of players who adore playing for their country and will walk through fire to do it. I am so so proud. I would love to go to at least one of the games, although I am finding it hard to reconcile going to Qatar. With the cost of living crisis I\u2019m not sure how much future me will thank current me for the debt. But then I also have to quiet that little girl inside me who dreamed of seeing Wales in a World Cup and never thought this day would come. Emma, 41, college lecturer, Bristol \u2018We\u2019ve gone from crying into pints to being covered in beer\u2019  There have been so many times where we nearly did it and had our hearts broken that I started to think it would never happen in my lifetime. Then we qualified for Euro 2016 and made it to the semi-finals. That changed everything. We\u2019ve gone from crying into our pints to being covered in beer from crazy celebrations. We\u2019ve had very good players over the years but never a team like Coleman\u2019s, and now Rob Page\u2019s. It all started with Gary Speed. I wish he was here to see this. We fear nobody in that group and the game against England on 29 November will be massive. Jon, 45, customer service manager, Caerphilly \u2018I cried at every failure. Finally I\u2019m crying with joy\u2019  I am beyond joyed at our qualification, particularly as a lifelong fan who attended every failure since the 1985 game against Scotland. I have cried at each of our failures, rode the wave of hope before and during each game. Finally, I got to cry with joy at our wonderful achievement. I am blown away by our progress. It is such a pity that the finals are in Qatar, a country I could not possibly visit with its abhorrent record of human rights, and the death toll of workers on the stadiums and infrastructure. The finals should never have been given to them. David, 60, environmental scientist, Powys"

                    "body": "Gareth Southgate is concerned England could be a target for referees at the World Cup after Harry Maguire was denied what looked a clear penalty in the 6-2 win against Iran on Monday.\nThe England manager was uneasy at how a goalscoring clip from one of his team\u2019s qualifying ties had been used in the referees\u2019 briefing for the tournament as an example of foul play.\nIt came from the 5-0 Wembley win against Albania in November last year and showed Kalvin Phillips blocking an opponent at a free-kick to help create the space for Maguire to head home. The clip was shown to referees, all the competing nations and media.\n\nSouthgate saw Maguire wrestled to the ground by the Iran defender Rouzbeh Cheshmi on a third-minute Kieran Trippier corner only for neither the referee nor the VAR to intervene. The manager is worried that the clip from the Albania tie could have influenced the decision and he wants to discuss the matter with Fifa. At the end of the Iran game, John Stones conceded a soft penalty for a shirt tug on Mehdi Taremi when defending a set piece.\n\u201cWhat worries me is we were used in an example in the referees\u2019 video,\u201d Southgate said. \u201cWhat we were shown [in the briefing] \u2013 the incident in the first half [against Iran] \u2026 we were told that would be a definite penalty. In the second half, maybe there\u2019s a shirt pull, we\u2019ve got to be better on that, but I\u2019m a bit worried we were the example shown. And then to get a decision as happened in the first half \u2013 we need some clarification really as to how it\u2019s going to be.\u201d\n\nSouthgate remembered how the Football Association had gone to Fifa to discuss penalty decisions after England\u2019s opening match at the last World Cup \u2013 the 2-1 win against Tunisia. The goal they conceded was from a penalty and Southgate was aggrieved England did not get one after Harry Kane was pulled to the turf.\n\u201cIt happened in Russia and we\u2019ve got to have that dialogue with Fifa [again],\u201d Southgate said. \u201cWe want clarity. Otherwise we don\u2019t know where we stand. Goals are going in and we don\u2019t know whether they stand or not. The bit that worries me is we were the example shown.\u201d\n\nSouthgate also discussed the balance he wants to find between allowing his players to meet with their families in Qatar and controlling the risk of Covid transmission. Some of the players went into the stands after the Iran game to hug their loved ones.\nSouthgate was asked whether there had been full access to families for the England Women team during their victorious European Championship campaign in the summer. \u201cThat wasn\u2019t quite how it was with the girls,\u201d he replied. \u201cTowards the end, they had to batten that down a bit more because they had a few positive cases.\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to have to monitor it throughout but also there\u2019s this balance of the spirit and happiness of the group and the medical line of zero risk. Sometimes if you\u2019re going to take zero risks it can kill it for everybody. We\u2019re going to see how the next few days go and we\u2019ve talked about maybe looking at something after the second game [against USA on Friday]. We\u2019ve got to monitor the [Covid] rates out here as much as anything else.\u201d"

                    "body": "Iran\u2019s players covered up their national symbols by wearing jackets before the friendly with Senegal on Tuesday evening, showing solidarity with protests against the repression of women in their home country. The past 11 days have seen significant unrest in Iran after the death in custody of Mahsa Amini, who had been arrested on 13 September on suspicion of violating the strict law that requires women to cover their hair with a hijab. There have been widespread protests and before their match in Maria Enzersdorf, a town just outside Vienna, the national team made their anger visible. Carlos Queiroz\u2019s team wore black jackets while the national anthems were played, concealing their country\u2019s colours and badge. The match was played behind closed doors by edict of Iran\u2019s football association, which held the rights to the fixture, but a sizeable number of demonstrators gathered outside in an effort to make their voices heard on television feeds.  On Sunday the influential Iran forward Sardar Azmoun had spoken out in support of the protests via his Instagram account. \u201cAt worst I\u2019ll be dismissed from the national team,\u201d wrote the Bayern Leverkusen player. \u201cNo problem. I\u2019d sacrifice that for one hair on the heads of Iranian women. This story will not be deleted. They can do whatever they want. Shame on you for killing so easily; long live Iranian women.\u201d Azmoun, who scored in the 1-1 draw against Senegal and is expected to be a key player for Iran in the World Cup in Qatar, deleted the post but published a new, less strongly worded entry on Wednesday morning in support of Iranian women. He has joined a number of teammates in blacking out the profile pictures on his Instagram and Twitter accounts. Last week another national team player, Zobeir Niknafs, produced an Instagram video in which he shaved his head in solidarity with the protests. Gareth Southgate and his assistant, Steve Holland, were among those allowed inside to watch the game. England begin their World Cup campaign against Iran on 21 November. \u2022 This article was amended on 29 September 2022. Owing to an editing change, an earlier version mistakenly stated that Mahsa Amini was arrested for refusing to wear a hijab."

                    "body": "Until now the most gripping Australian sequel has probably been Mad Max 2. As anyone who has ever watched it will be aware there is a particularly scary moment when Wez, the baddie with the punk mohawk who everyone thought was history, suddenly reappears on the bonnet of the road warrior\u2019s thundering truck. For some at Twickenham the return of Eddie Jones as Australia\u2019s head coach must feel pretty similar. Because if the Rugby Football Union thought it had seen the back of Eddie it has been proved spectacularly wrong. Like Freddie Krueger in a tracksuit he is now back to haunt English dreams. Imagine if the Wallabies end up facing England in the knockout stages of this year\u2019s Rugby World Cup? And beating them. The RFU\u2019s decision to sack Jones last month would go down as one of the all-time great corporate howlers. Plenty of water, in fairness, still has to flow beneath the Sydney Harbour Bridge before that happens. Jones will need to find himself a fit fly-half and a decent physio, with injury problems having decimated the Wallabies over the latter half of last year. There is no guarantee Australia are suddenly going to waltz to the 2023 title just because they have ditched the likeable, understated Dave Rennie.  But that kookaburra cackle you can hear is Australians already relishing the entertainment value of it all. Jones does not officially take charge until 29 January but already he is back inside English heads. He knows Steve Borthwick\u2019s players inside out and rapid response transformations are his speciality. Think Red Adair in an Akubra hat with a sharper sense of humour. If nothing else the news has properly shaken up world rugby, more so even than Warren Gatland\u2019s prodigal return to Wales. Australia and Wales are in the same World Cup pool, with one of them likely to face England in the last eight. If a genuine crackle of expectancy did not already surround the quarter-final weekend in Marseille it does now. It also begs several broader questions. By letting Jones go without requiring him to serve any kind of gardening leave, the RFU has effectively handed over seven years of IP to one of its closest rivals and given them the inside track on their preparation secrets. History is littered with examples \u2013 New Zealand in 2003, South Africa in 2015, New Zealand again in 2019 \u2013 of Jones-coached sides lying in wait for supposedly better sides and, after months of intense planning, expertly springing the trap. Bill Sweeney, the RFU\u2019s chief executive, has previously declared himself relaxed at the prospect of Jones joining one of England\u2019s major rivals. How mellow he will be feeling if Australia are suddenly transformed while England take time to adjust to life under Borthwick and finish down the Six Nations batting order again could yet be another matter.  Because Jones, without question, will be on a mission to prove a lot of people wrong. For all his impressive World Cup CV \u2013 reaching the final with Australia in 2003, helping South Africa triumph as a consultant in 2007 \u2013 he has never guided a team to global glory as a head coach. When I spoke to him last month he sounded slightly wearier and more philosophical than usual but the old swagger will soon return if the Wallabies can catch a few promising early breaks. There is also a sense of a square peg finally back in a square hole. With England there was often a sense of Jones wrestling with slightly unfamiliar cultural factors \u2013 English reserve, the class system, public school attitudes, the less easily controlled media. Perhaps the happiest we saw him was back in Australia on tour last summer, sitting contentedly in his old stamping ground in Coogee, the master of all he surveyed. He will instinctively know which green and gold buttons to press, which is exactly why a gleeful Rugby Australia has hired him. Yes, it all ended messily back in England with the Twickenham crowd booing and England suffering a chastening defeat to the Springboks. Yes, France and Ireland are the current favourites to lift the Webb Ellis Cup in October. But, as the past 24 hours have once again underlined, things can change very swiftly in international rugby union. Suddenly Jones is back on fury road, not just looming large across England\u2019s windshield but also set to lock horns with the British &amp; Irish Lions who are due to tour Australia in 2025. In a ground-breaking development he is also assuming overall charge of the Wallaroos, Australia\u2019s women\u2019s side, opening up another fascinating front with the potential to irritate his former employees. There are less persistent outback flies than a motivated Jones when he has a specific goal to aim at. So pick up your popcorn and hold on tight. It is unlikely to be a boring ride. In many ways Jones and Australia are in precisely the position where they are traditionally most dangerous. Slight underdogs, a bit of mongrel required, a few quiet scores to settle. As far as Twickenham is concerned, Jones may be out of sight but no longer is he out of mind. That boomerang the RFU threw away before Christmas is in danger of coming back to whack them on the back of the head."

                    "body": "Out went Karim Benzema, all $54m of him on the scrap heap to go with the $340m already there. Behold the maimed knees and hamstrings of Paul Pogba ($54m), Christopher Nkunku ($124m) and N\u2019Golo Kant\u00e9 ($46m). Survey the busted calves and Achilles tendons of Mike Maignan ($54m) and Presnel Kimpembe ($62m). Add a Ballon d\u2019Or winner\u2019s dodgy quad to the list for a grand total of $394m in damaged goods.\nDo we trust in Transfermarkt? Probably not, but the Australian psyche needs something to hang its hopes on, even if it\u2019s only as tangible as numbers crunched by volunteers.\n\nAnd so, in that inexact and cold-hearted spirit, just look at all of those handsomely paid stars in that expensive metaphor of a casualty ward. Maybe with them in there the Socceroos can beat the rest out here? Hate to burst the bubble, but there\u2019s another $811m in the likely starting XI. To play more inaccurate games with inaccurate figures, that could possibly buy Australia\u2019s top-flight domestic league a couple of times over.\nMore seriously, though, no injury is a good thing. Australia ($58m in total) have only just felt that pain through the loss of Martin Boyle ($3m), and coach Graham Arnold and his squad have been quick to sympathise.\n\u201cIt\u2019s really sad for Benzema,\u201d Arnold said. \u201cHe\u2019s world player of the year and it would have been fantastic to play against him. That\u2019s what these types of experiences are about, to play against the current world champions and also have the opportunity to show the rest of the world what we\u2019re made of.\u201d\n\nThe point is more to ask a question about how much a team\u2019s success or otherwise can be predicted using numbers on paper. Title holders France undoubtedly wield a superior set of players with enviably superior depth. Didier Deschamps did not name an injury replacement for Benzema because he felt satisfied 25 would be enough. He does, after all, have Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 ($247m) and Antoine Griezmann ($39m), among the many others.\n\nA midfield without Pogba and Kant\u00e9 presents the most visible problem, with much of the pressure to shift onto the young shoulders of Aur\u00e9lien Tchouam\u00e9ni. Even then, defeating the Socceroos should not be a testing task. Except that it was four years ago during the group stage in Russia, where the score was tied at 1-1 until the 80th minute when an Australian own goal decided the match.\n\nDeschamps remembers this close call and has attempted to impress it upon his team, but there is little evidence that anyone from any quarter at this tournament is taking seriously a country ranked 38th which has not won a World Cup match since 2010. Not least the French players, who appear to have no knowledge about any of their opponents.\n\u201cNo, not at all, I don\u2019t know any of the players individually,\u201d Ibrahima Konat\u00e9 said on Sunday, in response to a question about his experiences playing against forward Mat Leckie while both were in the Bundesliga for RB Leipzig and Hertha Berlin respectively.\nKonat\u00e9 and his teammates make polite statements about Australia, mentioning their physicality and expecting them to sit back as they did at Russia 2018 under Bert van Marwijk. The Socceroos, conversely, know France back to front. They won\u2019t tell you that, though, because they are only focused on themselves.\nArnold has banned the F word (yep, you guessed it, France), allowing players to use only the word \u201cblue\u201d. \u201cIf we focus too much on the opposition, all we can do is put it in the brains of the players how good the opposition is,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe know their strengths. It\u2019s about those 10 blue shirts against 10 yellow. It\u2019s an individual battle, and we have got the Aussie DNA. We will go out there and have a fight, kick and scratch, do whatever is required.\u201d The exact definition of \u201cAussie DNA\u201d remains, six months into the unabating mantra, a source of external confusion.\nBut the reality is that Australia are facing the stars of the FIFA 23 game they\u2019ve been playing all week, while those stars have their attention on other things. The undermining issue for France right now is that the other things have less to do with football and more to do with dressing room disunity, a national federation in disarray and a Zinedine Zidane-shaped figure hovering ominously over Deschamps\u2019 shoulder. The feeling among French media is a mix of confidence and apprehension. They\u2019ll either go all the way or self-implode. There is no in between.\nIn stark contrast, the Australian camp is a picture of collegial calm. Every player says it, and the evidence bears the claim out.\n\u201cYou can say our players aren\u2019t playing in the top leagues in the world and all their players are,\u201d Arnold said. \u201cBut it\u2019s about team spirit, it\u2019s about connecting 11 players \u2013 and 26 players \u2013 together in a family environment, making sure they\u2019re mates and they\u2019ve got each other\u2019s backs. That\u2019s when you can get special results.\u201d\nAustralia are rated the outsiders of a tough group that features the reigning champions, world No.10 Denmark and Tunisia, and a 500-1 shot to win the tournament but Arnold, as always, is daring to dream.\n\u201cWhat I\u2019m looking at is the last 16. We\u2019ve got to give them a goal and expect to achieve that goal with performances that make the nation proud, and their families proud,\u201d Arnold said, before returning later to clarify his intentions. \u201cI want to go all the way. But success to start with is the last 16.\u201d\n\nThey are also well acclimatised in Qatar, having won 10 and drawn three of their 15 matches since 2008. This cycle they played a chunk of their qualifiers in Doha, including both playoffs against the United Arab Emirates and Peru. The latter \u2013 like many World Cup rivals \u2013 were unaccustomed to the conditions. It played a part in their shock demise and has the potential to mess with the expected pecking order.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a completely different environment from where they\u2019re coming from,\u201d Arnold said. \u201cIf they\u2019re coming from the English Premier League, or wherever else where the conditions cold, and you\u2019re coming into the heat, it\u2019s getting training times right and getting the days right. Because sometimes you just sit around all day waiting for training at night. You\u2019re sitting on the lounge, watching TV, and it takes the energy away.\u201d\nWhile Australia have been training at 5pm local time, France are not starting until 7pm. Deschamps, unlike Australia and the majority of other countries, is allowing media to watch entire sessions. On Sunday all signs pointed to Olivier Giroud starting as striker with Mbapp\u00e9 on the left in a 4-2-3-1 formation.\nAnd so, on Tuesday evening at the Al Janoub Stadium, Mbappe will seek to breach the net of Mat Ryan. France\u2019s most valuable player versus his Australian equivalent: $247m against $8m (allegedly). I know how this looks on paper."

                    "body": "Welcome to the very first Football Daily Christmas Awards. This is the bit where, in our old guise, we would bang on about becoming so jaded that we\u2019d lost count of how many years we\u2019d been churning out this old tat. Hmm, all of a sudden, the penny\u2019s beginning to drop. So OK, here we are, refreshed and ready to go! Pour yourself a pint of wine, throw your boots up on the desk, decompress, de-depress, and sing along: \u266b\u266a It feels like the first time, it feels like the very first time \u2026 \u266b\u266a\u266b THE FIVER AWARD FOR DISTINGUISHED EXIT Poor old Luka Modric. A player of such balletic beauty and grace, he could barely have been more elegant had he tiptoed on to the pitch down a sweeping staircase in top hat and tails. An aesthete\u2019s dream. His very last action in a World Cup match that really matters? To punt the ball straight at the nearby Alexis Mac Allister, and for it to come straight back up and into his startled face. A slapstick masterclass, and upon being immediately substituted it\u2019s just as well everyone in the stadium gave the Astaire of the Adriatic the standing ovation he deserved. THE WIMBLEDON 88 AWARD FOR PROGRESSIVE TACTICAL THINKING We got what we got, though of course the real fairytale ending to Qatar 2022 would have been the Netherlands finally winning a World Cup, albeit only with the brand of totaal langebal that nearly did for Argentina in the quarters. Imagine the beatific look of total etevredenheid on the face of professional contrarian Louis van Gaal had it all panned out! Imagine the reaction of total ebelediging on Johan Cruyff\u2019s affronted grid as he looked down from above! Fair\u2019s fair, give St Johan a couple of minutes, and he\u2019d surely have come round to all the deliberately provocative anti-beauty.  THE NETHERLANDS 74-22 AWARD FOR CONTRARY TACTICAL THINKING \u2026 but Louis is a professional contrarian, and Dutch to boot. So despite coming back at Argentina with tactics that were more Reep than Rep, he couldn\u2019t stop himself play-calling the most outrageous training-ground free-kick routine of all time. Totale vrije trap! It was executed perfectly by Koopmeiners and Weghorst, the assist-scorer stat of 2022 that most sounds either like a high-end department store in Rotterdam, a Groningen chocolaterie, or a Brel-influenced torch duo signed to the Philips label in 1968. No 1 with a totale kogel.  THE BEATLES AWARD FOR WANTING TO HOLD YOUR HAND (AND WHEN YOU TOUCH ME I FEEL HAPPY INSIDE) Antonio Conte is 5ft 8in. Thomas Tuchel is 6ft 2. But you know exactly how it would have ended had somebody not broken them up. THE JERRY LEE LEWIS MEMORIAL AWARD FOR BRISK DOWNWARD CAREER TRAJECTORY Poor old Stevie G was just 14 minutes away from doing his old club Liverpool the mother, father and extended family of all solids. His Aston Villa team were two up at Manchester City, a contribution to the title race that would have given him at least a little closure for that slip. Three goals in 336 seconds later, City were ahead and certs for the title. Oops, there goes that redemption! Less than five months later, Stevie was sacked, after which a former subordinate took his old job at Rangers. Oh Stevie. So close yet so far, very far away.  THE TIM CANTERBURY AWARD FOR EXASPERATION IN AN OFFICE FULL OF CLOWNS In his role as Rules Guy Alone in Andy\u2019s Old Tactics Truck on BT and ITV, Peter Walton gets an awful lot of stick for always agreeing with whatever the referees have just done. Football Daily has occasionally joined this pile-on, for which we now feel a strong pang of remorse. That\u2019s because we\u2019ve suddenly realised that Peter is simply agreeing with referees because those referees are cognisant of, and are accordingly acting upon, the laws of the game. That was never more clearly illustrated when he attempted to explain the reasoning behind the award of Argentina\u2019s stonewall penalty against Croatia in the Human Rights World Cup semi to a triptych of Gareth Keenans in the shape of Gary Neville, Roy Keane and Ian Wright. None of them were having it \u2013 furious old pros will be furious old pros \u2013 and Walton displayed remarkable composure in the face of a knowledge-lite salvo. Wait until they find out what Peter\u2019s done with their stapler! THE ALESSIA RUSSO AWARD FOR OTHER GREATEST MOMENT OF EURO 2022 All hail the magnificent torrent of up-in-your-grille abuse Jill Scott directed at Sydney Lohmann during England\u2019s win over Germany in the Wembley final. \u201c[Eff] off you [effing] pr1ck\u201d may look flat on the page when compared to PG Wodehouse, but sometimes it\u2019s all about the situation and delivery. In any case, her tinder-dry analysis of the incident was certainly Jeeves-esque: \u201cThe camera angle was very unfortunate.\u201d Scott retired from England duty after the game, causing Lohmann to send her a video message in jest: \u201cGood luck with your retirement, you [effing] pr1ck.\u201d A good-natured back and forth between two friends, although for any curse-word-averse readers overcome by the vapours: role models, will somebody think of the children, moral panic, etc.  THE SCOTLAND AWARD FOR REGULAR WORLD CUP QUALIFICATION Time was, Italy not making it to the finals was news. THE MOLTON BROWN AWARD FOR PREMIUM SKINCARE Frank Lampard\u2019s voice can rarely be heard these days during post-match pressers over the furious washing of hands. But the cleaner the hands, the more pH-balanced purchase you can get while throwing players under the bus. A masterclass in dermatological deflection, from the five-goal thumping at Spurs to the twin defeats at Bournemouth, via humiliations against Leicester and Crystal Palace and everything in between. Beep beep! Hope that suspension passes the MOT! At least he kept Everton up, though reports that the club\u2019s famous nil satis nisi optimum motto (\u201cNothing but the best is good enough\u201d) is to be replaced with problemata, quae hic coram me erant, fixa pernoctare non possunt (\u201cIssues that were there before me don\u2019t take care of themselves overnight\u201d) remain unconfirmed for now.  THE FIREWALL FC AWARD FOR UNFORTUNATE LINGUISTIC JUXTAPOSITION Southend United, for selling the naming rights of their West Stand to a local firm of estate agents called Gilbert and Rose. Mind how you parse that, chaps, and we\u2019d send that via the subs bench before getting the signwriters in, if we were you. THE NYTOL-FIFA AWARD FOR SLEEPING LIKE BABIES This prestigious award is yet again shared by the more entrenched supporters of compunction-lite powerhouses Manchester City, Chelsea, PSG and Newcastle United. Mind you, there\u2019s a decent chance they\u2019ll all have to budge up next year to make room for some Manchester United and Liverpool counterparts, seeing as both clubs, along with their freeholds atop the moral high ground, are now up for sale and vulnerable to folk wielding big bags of the old petro-pennies. Masterclasses in legacy-club cognitive dissonance coming right up! And on that subject \u2026 THE QATAR 22 ATTENDEE / VIEWER / READER / REPORTER AWARD FOR MENTAL CONFLICT AND GENERAL BELIEF-ACTION DISCREPANCIES This one goes to everyone on that party bus with fixed grins and dead eyes, insisting they were lost in the carefree celebration of a successful season. Oh J\u00fcrgen, we get what you were trying to achieve! Really we do. But the subsequent Fulham, United, Everton, Napoli, Brighton, Arsenal, Forest and Leeds results suggest your gambit to pick everyone up after that nightmarish last week didn\u2019t quite cut through.  THE SAM BANKMAN-FRIED AWARD FOR FREE-JAZZ FINANCIAL IMPROV Barcelona: mes que un shower. Good luck in Big Vase, having bet the farm on going deep into Big Cup! At least all the games are guaranteed to be on TV. For the next 25 years. If they survive that long. THE CONGRESSIONAL MEDAL OF HONOUR FOR CRYING Jos\u00e9 Mourinho cried upon winning Tin Pot with Roma. There\u2019s nowt wrong with that at all; in fact it\u2019s to be commended. Let it all out, Jos\u00e9, just like Football Daily plans to do yet again while watching the end of It\u2019s a Wonderful Life. Even so, it\u2019s mildly amusing to speculate what Jos\u00e9 2004 would have felt about such a display. Contempt? Yes, contempt, almost certainly. Contempt about getting so emotional after winning a third-rate pot, that is. Not the townsfolk helping George Bailey out of a hole. We\u2019re sure he\u2019d have been in bits about that, just like us.  THE SUELLA BRAVERMAN AWARD FOR LEVEL-HEADED POLITICAL POSITIONS Peter Shilton, the bizarro-world Neville Southall, had already this year gone out of his way to have a pint with Nigel Farage on GB News and announce that he\u2019d never take the knee. Now he\u2019s spent a recent evening berating a \u201cMegan Markel\u201d on social media and accusing her of \u201cplaying every card including the race card\u201d. Aside from the fact that the Grauniad having an opportunity to pick apart your spelling is probably time to take a long look at yourself, these aren\u2019t great optics. But why the hate, Shilts? Who or what hurt you? We can only surmise that he\u2019s never got over that ball looping towards his penalty box in the Azteca. Every time he closes his eyes, he never gets to it first! God damn the Hand of Meg.  THE BARRY DAVIES AWARD FOR HAVING TO SAY THAT\u2019S MAGNIFICENT It\u2019s such a shame, because ITV\u2019s lead commentator\u2019s name lends itself to a magnificent slogan that most self-promoting broadcasters would kill for: \u201cIf it comes out of Sam Matterface\u2019s face, it matters!\u201d But it doesn\u2019t. The line berating poor Harry Kane for that career-defining penalty miss against France \u2013 \u201cWe needed Gary Lineker, but we got Chris Waddle\u201d \u2013 was spectacularly unsympathetic and ill-judged, and yet also probably one of his better ones. Harry and Chris aren\u2019t the only ones who wish the bar was set a little higher. ITV still beat BBC, though, thanks to a combination of Roy Keane\u2019s barely suppressed apoplexies, and Ally McCoist\u2019s actual apoplexy upon witnessing South Korea\u2019s defending against Brazil, during which he reverted to an accent so thick that Stanley Baxter would have struggled to decipher all of the patter. Magnificent. He really is. BUMPER ONE-OFF FESTIVE TV &amp; RADIO SPECIAL: ALL THE HIGHLIGHTS FROM THE CHRISTMAS AND NEW YEAR PERIOD Right, aye. You are joking, aren\u2019t you? MAIL! MAIL! MAIL!

                    "body": "Good morning. A newly obtained autopsy report has concluded that a 43-year-old Florida man\u2019s death after being violently restrained by jailers was a homicide by strangulation. On 17 January 2021, Kevin Desir became unresponsive after a struggle with six deputies at the North Broward Bureau, a jail operated by the Broward county sheriff\u2019s office (BSO) in south Florida. The jail specifically detains arrestees who have mental and physical disabilities, as well as those with mental health problems. During the incident, Desir was handcuffed, punched repeatedly, shot with a stun gun and pepper-sprayed by officers, and lost consciousness after the deputies attempted to strap him into a restraint chair, Gloria Olapido reports. One deputy interlocked hands on Desir\u2019s neck from behind and used \u201chis body weight to leverage Desir back into the chair,\u201d according to a memo from the Broward county state attorney\u2019s office. BSO did not comment on the private autopsy findings.  Private and official autopsies do not tally. An official autopsy conducted by the Broward county medical examiner\u2019s office on 28 January 2021 found that Desir\u2019s cause and manner of death were undetermined. Broward county medical examiner\u2019s office did not comment on the differences between the two findings, but said that \u201cevery examination is separate and independent\u201d from law enforcement. Kevin Desir died a brutal death. His family believe jail deputies are responsible. Desir was arrested for marijuana possession. Four days later the 43-year-old Black man was handcuffed, punched, shot with a stun gun and pepper-sprayed by detention deputies. BSO said it stood by the internal reviews given to the deputies who had the most contact with Desir after the incident and that recommended training was \u201cnot an indication that the employees did anything wrong\u201d.  Italy home to 11 of 100-plus unofficial Chinese \u2018police stations\u2019  Italy hosts the highest number of unofficial Chinese \u201cpolice stations\u201d out of a network of more than 100 around the world, a report by a Spanish civil rights group has claimed. The northern city of Milan was allegedly used by two local Chinese public security authorities as a European testing ground for a policing strategy to monitor the Chinese population abroad and force dissidents to return home, Angela Giuffrida reports. The Madrid-based Safeguard Defenders reported in September that 54 such stations allegedly existed around the world, prompting police investigations in at least 12 countries including Canada, Germany and the Netherlands. Its latest report said 48 additional stations had been identified, 11 of which were in Italy. Other newly identified stations were in Croatia, Serbia and Romania, it said.  What are these stations used for? China has claimed the offices are merely \u201cservice stations\u201d set up to assist Chinese citizens with bureaucratic procedures such as renewing a passport or driving licence. Coronavirus is weakening and management protocols could be downgraded, an expert on China\u2019s state media has claimed, after unprecedented protests last week led to a significant shift in Beijing\u2019s commitment to its zero-Covid policy.  Democrats aim to seize outright Senate majority in Georgia runoff  Last month, Democrats secured control of the US Senate, keeping their fragile hold on power with 50 seats and Vice-president Kamala Harris as the tie-breaking vote. Winning the Georgia runoff election tomorrow would deliver Democrats more than just a single Senate seat: it would finally give them an outright majority, Lauren Gambino reports. The contest between the Democratic senator Raphael Warnock and his scandal-plagued and Donald Trump-backed Republican challenger, Herschel Walker, will determine whether the Democrats retain their 50-50 majority in the Senate, the narrowest possible balance of power, or whether they will expand it. In the weeks since the November midterm elections, when Warnock and Walker failed to clear the 50% threshold needed to avoid a runoff, Democrats and Republicans have spent tens of millions of dollars and dispatched their top surrogates to Georgia in an all-out effort to win the seat. Early voter turnout has been especially high and polls show a close contest.  \u201851 is better than 50\u2019. With a 51st seat, the Senate majority leader, Chuck Schumer, could assume greater control over the upper chamber, making governing easier and more expedient than it is currently in the evenly split Senate.  In other news   The Brazilian footballing great Pel\u00e9 has not been moved to palliative care, one of his daughters has said, downplaying reports that he was in end-of-life care after the 82-year-old was admitted to hospital last week to re-evaluate his treatment for colon cancer. Protesters in Iran have called for a three-day strike amid conflicting reports that the nation\u2019s \u201cmorality police\u201d have been shut down, and as the US said the leadership in Tehran had locked itself into a \u201cvicious cycle\u201d. \u201cGoblin mode\u201d has been chosen by the public as the 2022 Oxford word of the year. The term refers to \u201ca type of behaviour which is unapologetically self-indulgent, lazy, slovenly, or greedy, typically in a way that rejects social norms or expectations\u201d. A leader of moderate Republicans in the US House has repeatedly refused to condemn Donald Trump, even after the former president, running for re-election in 2024, said the US constitution should be \u201cterminated\u201d to allow him to return to power.  World Cup: England to play France in mouthwatering quarter-final tie  England have a long history of disappointing their fans at major tournaments \u2013 losing to teams they should beat or managing to be less than the sum of their parts. But since Gareth Southgate took over as manager they have been oddly competent, reaching the semi-final of the last World Cup and the final of last year\u2019s European Championships, where they were a penalty shootout away from victory. And that trend has continued in Qatar. On Sunday they faced Senegal, a team they might have struggled to beat under previous managers. But they took their chances ruthlessly and eased to a 3-0 victory. They\u2019ll now face France in the quarter-final. The reigning champions played Poland in Sunday\u2019s early game and survived a few early wobbles before completing a 3-1 victory. Two of their goals came from Kylian Mbapp\u00e9, who already looks the player of the tournament. Both of his goals were stunning finishes, the work of a man who looked like he scored simply because he wanted to. France will be the slim favorites to advance to the semi-final when they play England on Saturday. Elsewhere at the World Cup:  The US\u2019s campaign ended with a 3-1 loss to the Netherlands on Saturday. The Americans were outclassed by a more experienced team but there is hope for the future thanks to the team\u2019s promising young core. Guardian US\u2019s Bryan Graham was following the team in Qatar and assesses their chances for 2026, when the US co-hosts the World Cup. One of the highlights of this World Cup has been the success of teams outside the traditional powerhouses of South America and Europe. Two of those teams play today. Japan take on 2018 finalists Croatia at 10am ET, while South Korea play five-time champions Brazil at 2pm ET. Both teams are underdogs but they have sprung surprises so far this tournament and are capable of doing so again. Doha\u2019s $36bn metro has been a hive of activity during the tournament \u2013 but its construction has carried a human cost.  Don\u2019t miss this: Vanuatu\u2019s deaf community push for national sign language  \u201cI woke up one morning and remember not hearing the birds sing, or the rooster crowing,\u201d says Tasale Edward Bule, a 45-year-old fisher from Vanuatu\u2019s Efate Island, as he remembers the day his world went silent. \u201cI asked everyone to call my name to see if I would hear them \u2013 it was then I realised I had lost the hearing in both my ears.\u201d Bule\u2019s story would be familiar to much of the deaf community in the Pacific country of Vanuatu, write Sera Sefeti and Agnes Herbert. With no national sign language, most people have to invent their own ways to communicate. Some use signs they\u2019ve developed with their families and communities, but then struggle to communicate outside this group. Others, like Bule, rely largely on lip-reading to get by. \u2026 or this: Meet the people who help total strangers  Voluntary giving is one of the fastest and most reliable ways to improve a giver\u2019s own mood and wellbeing, writes Sally Howard. Many scientific papers have shown that it stimulates activity in brain regions associated with pleasure and reward, reduces physiological stress levels and leads, when giving becomes a habit, to long-term improvements in the life satisfaction of those who do good deeds. In the past few years, though, a new breed of performative Samaritan has strode on to social media, toting wads of readies. They include Primenaz, a TikTok user who drops $20 bills at strangers\u2019 feet and gifts his targets extra cash if they attempt to return them; and Sydney-based Tom, who films himself hovering behind unsuspecting shoppers at the till as he pays their checkout bills. Climate check: Stop burning trees to make energy, say scientists before Cop15  More than 650 scientists are urging world leaders to stop burning trees to make energy because it destroys valuable habitats for wildlife, writes Phoebe Weston. In the buildup to Cop15, the UN biodiversity summit, they say countries urgently need to stop using forest bioenergy to create heat and electricity as it undermines international climate and nature targets. Instead, renewable energy sources such as wind and solar should be used, they say. Bioenergy has \u201cwrongly been deemed \u2018carbon neutral\u2019\u201d and many countries are increasingly relying on forest biomass to meet net zero goals, according to the letter. \u201cThe best thing for the climate and biodiversity is to leave forests standing \u2013 and biomass energy does the opposite,\u201d it says. Last Thing: Why forgotten words need rescuing from obscurity  \u201cI collect and read old dictionaries, post the most interesting words I find online and write about their histories and origins,\u201d writes Paul Anthony Jones, linguist and author of Why is This a Question? Everything about the Origins and Oddities of Language You Never Thought to Ask. Obscure words aren\u2019t just for Christmas, either. Imagine how much our discourse could be expanded with terms like flapdoodler (19th-century slang for a dissembling political speaker), roorback (a rumour circulated for political gain), adullamite (someone dissatisfied with the current political outlook) or grantism (political cronyism and nepotism, after President Grant awarded more than 30 of his friends and relatives high-profile positions in the early 1870s).

                    "body": "Garang Kuol is yet to start a league match at senior level, but the 18-year-old striker will go to the World Cup after being included as a wildcard selection in Australia\u2019s 26-man squad for the tournament in Qatar. Labelled an \u201cimpact player\u201d by Socceroos coach, Graham Arnold, Kuol will be joined on the plane by his Central Coast Mariners teammate Jason Cummings, but in shock selection decisions there was no place for experienced defender Trent Sainsbury or in-form goalkeeper Mitch Langerak on the final list announced on Tuesday. Kuol, who will join Newcastle United in January, has been rewarded for a string of eye-catching performances off the bench for the Mariners since making his A-League Men debut in April.  The teenager has made just 12 league appearances as a substitute and was called up to his first national squad in September before making his international debut, again off the bench, in a friendly against New Zealand. His ability to change the course of a game in an instant was the main reason for his inclusion, and Arnold said the youngster had the potential to be a breakout star of the tournament. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen these types of things happen many times before at World Cups and massive games where players who are unknown come out and shock the whole of the country\u201d he said. \u201cHe is really a player that has absolutely zero fear who just goes out and wants to entertain. He did that against New Zealand and he\u2019s shown from the start of the A-League this season that he\u2019s a player that can change a game.\u201d Kuol\u2019s club teammate Cummings also made his Socceroos debut in that win over New Zealand, finding the net with a penalty after coming on as a second-half substitute.  The Scotland-born forward, who qualifies for the Socceroos thanks to his Australian mother, got the nod over Adam Taggart in Arnold\u2019s squad, with a lack of form and minutes ultimately costing the Cerezo Osaka player, despite having featured heavily in the qualification campaign. Sainsbury, a former Socceroos captain and Arnold\u2019s son-in-law, paid the price for a lack of recent playing time and a dip in form. \u201cIt was a very difficult decision,\u201d Arnold said. \u201cHe hasn\u2019t played for a number of weeks, but overall I\u2019ve gone for players like [Harry] Souttar and [Kye] Rowles who are doing exceptionally.\u201d In goal, captain Mat Ryan appears assured of his place in the starting XI, after Nagoya Grampus keeper Langerak was overlooked in the most surprising of Arnold\u2019s decisions. Langerak, who stepped away from the Socceroos last year due to the impact of the pandemic, was coaxed back out of international retirement and selected in the squad for September\u2019s games with New Zealand. His strong form \u2013 14 clean sheets from 33 appearances this season \u2013 and regular minutes in the J-League hinted he might push Ryan for the No 1 jersey, but he did not feature against New Zealand and now Arnold has overlooked the 34-year-old in favour of Central Coast\u2019s Danny Vukovic. Arnold said Langerak was a \u201cfantastic\u201d goalkeeper, but bringing him back into the fold for the New Zealand games was only ever about providing potential cover for others. The qualification playoff penalty shootout hero Andrew Redmayne is the other keeper included. Ajdin Hrustic, one of the first names on Arnold\u2019s team sheet, will fly to Qatar having recovered from an injury picked up while on club duty for Hellas Verona. Arnold said the attacking midfielder was \u201cfit and ready to go\u201d and expecting to get some game time in Serie A this weekend.  Harry Souttar and Martin Boyle, both likely starters, have also been included despite clouds over their fitness. Key defender Souttar made a non-playing return to Stoke City\u2019s matchday squad at the weekend after a knee reconstruction, while winger Boyle sustained a knee injury playing for Hibernian last month. Boyle is expected to hit the ground running in Qatar. \u201cOnce he puts those boots on he\u2019ll be ready to go,\u201d said Arnold, who admitted he was taking risks with some of his selections. \u201cBut this is what it\u2019s all about,\u201d he said. \u201cI have taken risks before and I am prepared to do that again.\u201d Tom Rogic, who has barely played this year and pulled out of the Socceroos qualification playoffs without citing a reason, misses out. \u201cWe need players who are fit and ready and I just felt at this moment in time it was a decision to make on the playing side of it,\u201d Arnold said of the West Brom midfielder\u2019s absence. The squad features nine members of the Tokyo 2020 Olyroos\u2019 squad in Nathaniel Atkinson, Keanu Baccus, Thomas Deng, Cameron Devlin, Joel King, Riley McGree, Kye Rowles, Souttar and Mitchell Duke, who was the overage player. \u201cWe have worked hard to give younger players an opportunity over the campaign, to expose them to international football, to test them against the best and I\u2019m thrilled with the development and maturity of this group who now get a chance on the biggest stage possible,\u201d Arnold said. Australia kick off their Group D campaign against two-times champions France on 23 November, before meeting Tunisia three days later and then Denmark in the early hours of 1 December AEDT. Australia squad: Mat Ryan (captain), Nathaniel Atkinson, Keanu Baccus, Aziz Behich, Martin Boyle, Jason Cummings, Milos Degenek, Thomas Deng, Cameron Devlin, Mitchell Duke, Craig Goodwin, Ajdin Hrustic, Jackson Irvine, Fran Karacic, Joel King, Garang Kuol, Mathew Leckie, Awer Mabil, Jamie Maclaren, Riley McGree, Aaron Mooy, Andrew Redmayne, Kye Rowles, Harry Souttar, Danny Vukovic, Bailey Wright."

                    "body": "Football\u2019s capacity to unite is routinely lauded, but Sunday\u2019s World Cup match between England and Senegal has already divided many west African families in London. The split is generational. Parents say they tend to support Senegal, the country of their birth, while their children opt to support the state they were raised in: England. Among the former is British citizen Ndene Ndiaye who arrived in London in 2009 from the capital, Dakar, and is hopeful of a slender Senegalese victory. The 54-year-old, who works at the acclaimed Trinity Laban Conservatoire of Music and Dance in Deptford, south-east London, said: \u201cSenegal represents home and I think they\u2019ll win, but my children were born here and they\u2019re English supporters all the way.\u201d Behind the fresh food counter at Tomi\u2019s Kitchen, within the heart of Deptford\u2019s sizeable west African population, Peter Odise also confirmed his family had segregated on similar lines. A staunch Senegal fan \u2013 despite hailing from fellow west African state Nigeria \u2013 Odise explained that his 16-year-old son was an ardent Arsenal supporter and played for the club\u2019s junior football team. \u201cLots of the black community here support Senegal, but the young, including my son, support England.\u201d Siding with their country of birth had been made easier, said Odise, by the prevalence of black footballers in the England squad. Among the west African community in this corner of the UK capital, one England player stands above all others: Bukayo Saka. Odise, 57, said: \u201cSaka has Nigerian parents, but is totally English. He\u2019s inspirational for many. My son wants to be like him.\u201d Two minutes along Deptford High Street, Emeka, a self-employed exporter from east Nigeria, predicted a 2-1 win for Senegal. Again, it was a result that would not impress his two children, Londoners aged 11 and 14.  \u201cFor me that\u2019d be good, I support Africa but they support England,\u201d said the 45-year-old, picking up a portion of fried fish lunch at the Island Buka restaurant. Among his peers, the footballing success of Senegal \u2013 the region\u2019s other World Cup representatives, Ghana, were knocked out on Friday \u2013 has united west Africans. The scenes certain to be witnessed on Sunday at Deptford\u2019s Ivory Restaurant will bear testimony to that regional support. Hundreds of supporters \u2013 many carrying drums and waving Senegalese flags \u2013 are expected to congregate in the venue. Herbert Ngassi, who has run the restaurant since 2018, expects it will be a raucous occasion. Yet such an overt display of national pride is rare for London\u2019s Senegalese diaspora. Ngassi, 44, said they preferred to socialise modestly at each other\u2019s homes, rather than throw ostentatious parties. \u201cThey are a French-speaking community, a hard-working community, a community who, more or less Muslim, does not like to drink and party.\u201d Ngassi, from Ivory Coast \u2013 a traditional powerhouse of west African football but which failed to qualify for the World Cup finals \u2013 said the inter-generational divide in the Senegalese community was not solely evidenced in the team they support on Sunday. \u201cThe young have a new way of living but the older generation have maybe stuck to their roots. They have memories of back home, family \u2013 and the young have never experienced life there.\u201d With the temperature struggling to reach 7C on Friday afternoon, Ngassi predictably said that the weather was what he most missed about west Africa. \u201cAlso the food, so full of vitamins, the warmth of the people,\u201d said Ngassi. And what if Senegal get knocked out? \u201cThat\u2019s easy. We\u2019ll all support England.\u201d"

                    "body": "\u201cThe dragon on my shirt; that\u2019s all I need,\u201d Gareth Bale said, looking down at the Wales crest on his red polo shirt, swaying on a swivel chair in Dinard with a little abandon before their quarter-final victory over Belgium at Euro 2016. That statement feels as though it will soon be put to the test.\nAs the sun set in Doha on Monday, morphing into the marshmallow skies, Bale was again holding court, repeatedly checking his watch as the questions flowed. He knew it was only a matter of time before he was asked whether Wales\u2019s game against England on Tuesday could be his last for his country? \u201cNope,\u201d Bale snapped back, arms folded. Well, that\u2019s that \u2013 for now at least.\nNot all questions were so predictable. Among the others was: how was the rack of Welsh lamb? On Sunday the celebrity chef Bryn Williams brought Welsh cakes and cooked dinner, fit with mint sauce and caper dressing, at the team hotel in West Bay. \u201cHopefully it gives us a better performance \u2013 we would love nothing more,\u201d Bale said with a spoonful of perspective.\n\n\u201cWe are trying to keep our spirits high. We have to remember we are at a World Cup, for the first time in a long time. We would rather be at a World Cup maybe not doing amazingly well than sat at home on the sofa not doing anything. We are happy to be here and we are going to give everything we can to try to qualify.\u201d\nSix years ago Bale, whose career is winding down in the US, could do no wrong, a superpower grazing and grinning his way through Wales\u2019s extraordinary ride to the semi-finals. He infamously served up a home run for anyone with even a millilitre of Welsh blood, insisting Wales had more passion than England.\n\u201cI feel we are the most passionate country in the world and that will never change in my mind,\u201d Bale maintained the day before Wales flew to Qatar. But suddenly he \u2013 together with Aaron Ramsey \u2013 finds himself on the sharp end of the flak thrown Wales\u2019s way following a miserable start to their first World Cup in 64 years.\n\nPerhaps the difficulty is that we have come to expect so much more. It has led Bale into a strange and somewhat awkward spot where the player who is probably Wales\u2019s finest of all time feels it necessary to justify his workrate amid the clamour, in places, for him to be dropped so he can hand the baton on to a younger model.\n\u201cI was flying into tackles in the 95th minute the other day,\u201d he said. \u201cSometimes it works, sometimes it doesn\u2019t. Sometimes I have a good game, sometimes I don\u2019t. It\u2019s football; it\u2019s difficult to always play well. The one thing I always do is give 100%.\u201d\nRob Page, the Wales manager, gave credence to the possibility of Bale and Ramsey being among the substitutes at Ahmad bin Ali Stadium. \u201cIt\u2019s a big ask for anybody in this environment to go four days later from one competitive game to another,\u201d Page said.\n\u201cThey are talented footballers. OK, we\u2019re all getting a bit of criticism right now, and rightly so because results ain\u2019t going our way and [because of] our performances. That\u2019s the industry. We\u2019re big enough to take it \u2013 it\u2019s not a problem. We\u2019ll put our big-boy pants on and get on with it. We\u2019ll have a team that\u2019s ready for England.\u201d\n\nBale knows England are not infallible. \u201cEveryone has weaknesses,\u201d the Wales captain said. \u201cWe\u2019ve done our homework. We\u2019ve had meetings and I\u2019m sure they\u2019ve done the same with us. England are a very good team. They are one of the favourites to win the tournament. We are under no illusions that it will be hard. There\u2019s been a few shocks in the tournament already and there\u2019s no reason why we can\u2019t do the same.\u201d\nIn the summer Bale insisted there were a few more years left in the legs and that he wants to help Wales reach another European Championship, for which qualifying begins in March. He signed a 12-month contract with Los Angeles FC that runs until June with the scope to extend until 2024. But for a while it has been impossible to escape the sense that Bale is making it up as he goes along, playing minutes and scoring wonder-goals on his terms, orbiting his own star.\n\nSince the qualifying for this competition began 18 months ago, Wales have unashamedly been his primary focus. So would exiting the World Cup give Bale a decision to make? \u201cI will play for Wales until the day I stop playing football,\u201d the 33-year-old said last year. \u201cI love playing for Wales.\u201d\nWales will fly home to Cardiff unless they can beat England for the first time since 1984, and even then that might not be enough. Technically, qualifying for the last 16 is in their own hands but unless they spank England by a four-goal margin, to progress they need a win and Iran and the USA to play out a draw.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t get divided by a bad team performance or result,\u201d Bale said, alluding to Wales\u2019s Together Stronger slogan that has stuck since Euro 2016. \u201cWe stick together because we are stronger as a group.\u201d Regardless of how Tuesday unfolds, Bale deserves a dignified exit."

                    "body": "Casemiro had a confession. \u201cI sometimes feel sorry for our opponents,\u201d Brazil\u2019s Manchester United midfielder said. \u201cWe have so many good players.\u201d Considering he was not boasting or exaggerating but merely being candid it may seems something of a surprise that Casemiro\u2019s international manager, Tite, his teammate Marquinhos and Tite\u2019s assistant C\u00e9sar Sampaio devoted most of a 40-minute media briefing on Sunday to discussing an injured forward.\nNo prizes for guessing that man is Neymar, with question after question concentrating on how Brazil will cope without him against Switzerland on Monday and how the striker with 75 goals in 122 games for his country could be replaced.\nTite used a lot of words to, engagingly and eruditely, avoid answering both inquiries. \u201cWe\u2019ve already decided the starting players but we will only be communicating that right before the game,\u201d said the manager, who could offer no timeframe on when Neymar may return from an ankle ligament injury but expressed confidence the player\u2019s World Cup was not over. \u201cFootball\u2019s about context and sometimes we have to be strategic,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have to think outside the box but we\u2019re very confident we have the right replacement.\u201d\n\nSitting alongside him, Marquinhos repeatedly referred to his manager as \u201cthe professor\u201d. Tite, though, was keeping much of his wisdom to himself. He merely smiled when someone asked whether the versatile, and richly gifted Newcastle midfielder Bruno Guimar\u00e3es may fill Neymar\u2019s No 10 role between Raphinha and Vin\u00edcius J\u00fanior, and just behind Richarlison.\nTite was more forthcoming when asked whether referees should afford greater protection to Neymar, injured after a heavy challenge by Nikola Milenkovic during the opening Group G 2-0 win against Serbia. \u201cIf you want to celebrate the football you have to pay attention to the fouls,\u201d the 61-year-old said. \u201cThey target specific players and this is the effect. It has to be stopped.\u201d\n\nMany Brazil fans want to see Real Madrid\u2019s 21-year-old attacking prodigy Rodrygo fill the gap vacated by Neymar but others would advance Lucas Paquet\u00e1 from midfield.\n\u201cWe can\u2019t stop talking about Neymar,\u201d Casemiro said. \u201cIt\u2019s just how important he is to us. He\u2019s our biggest player, the difference for us, but we have a lot of other very good players too. Rodrygo, for example, lights up the eyes and delights everyone who sees him play.\u201d\nAfter selecting an extremely attacking starting XI against Serbia Tite may turn slightly more conservative at Stadium 974. Although Brazil remain strong favourites, Switzerland succeeded in holding them to a 1-1 draw in the opening game of Russia 2018.\n\nTheir manager, Murat Yakin, possesses high-calibre talent of his own in, among others, the creative catalyst Xherdan Shaqiri, the midfield enforcer Granit Xhaka and the Yaound\u00e9-born striker Breel Embolo, scorer in the 1-0 win against Cameroon on Thursday.\nAlthough Embolo is not in Neymar\u2019s league it is easy to find a player who runs his own charity foundation helping Swiss refugees and disadvantaged children in Cameroon infinitely more appealing than Brazil\u2019s talisman. Many Brazilians have been outraged by Neymar\u2019s very public support for the country\u2019s far-right, polarising and outgoing president, Jair Bolsonaro.\nThe opinion of those who claim Tite\u2019s team are often better balanced without Neymar, who has pledged to dedicate his first goal at Qatar 2022 Bolsonaro, are frequently coloured as much by politics as tactics. \u201cNeymar doesn\u2019t deserve this,\u201d Casemiro said. \u201cHe has a great heart.\u201d\nTite, meanwhile, expressed regret that Danilo, too, is nursing an injured ankle. The manager declined to identify the Juventus defender\u2019s replacement \u2013 although the 39-year-old Dani Alves is widely expected to return at right-back \u2013 and indicated a degree of caution could be called for against Switzerland.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re different from Serbia,\u201d he said. \u201cThey have very intelligent midfield and forward players; we can still play offensively but in a different manner.\u201d\nOnce Sampaio started speaking the narrative resumed a familiar theme. \u201cNeymar\u2019s an extraordinary talent, obviously,\u201d said Tite\u2019s assistant. \u201cBut we can rely on our other players; they really are a gift to football. Neymar has the leading role but often, as we see with the movies, someone who is not the protagonist steals the scene.\u201d\nMarquinhos agreed. \u201cWe wish we could have Neymar and Danilo with us,\u201d the PSG defender said. \u201cBut the professor can confirm the talented players we have will maintain our level. Switzerland will give us a run for our money but we can still seal our place in the last 16.\u201d"

                    "body": "Sometimes in football, as in life, you don\u2019t always get what you deserve. We might otherwise now be lauding Germany for defying Fifa before beating Japan in their World Cup opener. Instead, after an upset that resembled Hokusai\u2019s The Great Wave off Kanagawa in its force and magnitude, the sniping from the critics quickly began.\nThere was a common refrain after Germany\u2019s 2-1 defeat: that they had paid the price for being too distracted by daring to stick up for human rights. As one Qatari reporter\u2019s account, liked more than 200,000 times on social media, put it: \u201cThis is what happens when you don\u2019t focus on football.\u201d\nIt reeked of schadenfreude. It stank of scoreboard journalism. And it was also plain wrong, on multiple levels.\n\nGermany did not lose because their players put their hands over their mouths to signify that they had been gagged by Fifa. Or because they wore rainbow-coloured boots. Or because their interior minister wore a OneLove armband while sitting next to the Fifa president, Gianni Infantino.\nIf there was a lack of focus, how come Hansi Flick\u2019s side enjoyed 74% possession, had 25 shots compared with 11 for Japan, and largely dominated until removing Ilkay G\u00fcndogan and Thomas M\u00fcller on 67 minutes? More often than not in such games, a 1-0 lead becomes two or three. Instead a match that had appeared so controlled suddenly turned to chaos in the final 20 minutes.\nThere\u2019s another, even more important, point to make here. Even if Germany\u2019s protest had directly contributed to their defeat, it would have still been the right thing to do. Standing up for universal rights, for tolerance and freedom, matters far more than 22 people kicking a ball around. It is a damning failure on Fifa\u2019s part that it fails to recognise this.\nLet us make a prediction. That photograph of the German players with their hands over their mouths will, like the one of the Iran team who bowed their heads when their anthem played against England, reverberate down the years and the generations. Even if they go out of this World Cup in the first round. Some things just matter more.\n\nAs Germany\u2019s captain, Manuel Neuer, explained after the game, they wanted to make a stand after Fifa stopped them and six other nations from wearing a OneLove armband. \u201cWe said they can take our armband, but as much as Fifa might want to, they will never silence us,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cWe stand for our values and for human rights. We wanted to show that.\u201d\nNeuer, who was part of the Germany players\u2019 council that came up with the idea on Tuesday, also expressed anger with Fifa\u2019s threat to issue sporting sanctions after the tournament started. \u201cThe timing was actually horrible for me. We didn\u2019t know what sanctions there might be.\u201d\nUnder Flick, Germany have quickly earned a reputation for attacking play, having scored four or more goals six times in his 15 matches before coming to Qatar. And such was their early dominance, the only surprise was that it took 33 minutes for them to go ahead through a G\u00fcndogan penalty.\nYet the second goal didn\u2019t come. And although Japan completed only 62 passes in the first half, a switch to three at the back allowed them to get back into the game. As the centre-back Maya Yoshida said: \u201cWe changed the shape. Jamal Musiala and M\u00fcller were in pockets all the time and we struggled to catch them. We tried to go three at the back. After that, they struggled a bit and we did much better.\u201d\nEven so, Germany had not lost a World Cup match when ahead at half-time since losing to Austria in 1978 \u2013 a run of 21 games. But then in the space of eight minutes everything suddenly spiralled out of control. On 75 minutes Ritsu Doan equalised. Then Takuma Asano lashed home the winner.\nSuddenly Germany were faced with a stark reality of knowing they will have to beat Spain on Sunday to retain control of their own destiny.\nMeanwhile Japan\u2019s players went wild. And their fans wilder still. There were thousands of them here and they all seemed to break into a sustained chorus of \u201cNippon Ol\u00e9\u201d. Ol\u00e9, indeed. But bravo to Germany, too."

                    "body": "Eddie Jones has insisted referees must be treated with respect after joking that Rassie Erasmus may take a leaf out of Jos\u00e9 Mourinho\u2019s book and sidestep his matchday ban on Saturday by hiding in a laundry basket. Jones also wondered whether Erasmus\u2019s outbursts and the siege mentality South Africa have fostered has been designed to motivate the world champions. Erasmus, South Africa\u2019s director of rugby, implicitly criticised the English referee, Wayne Barnes, when posting a series of clips from the narrow defeat by France this month, alongside a number of sarcastic comments. Barnes has received death threats and his family have also been targeted, leading to the Rugby Football Union sending a strongly worded letter to its South African counterpart, deploring Erasmus\u2019s behaviour.  World Rugby tightened its regulations after banning Erasmus for 12 months for a similar outburst during the 2021 British &amp; Irish Lions tour and last week moved quickly to ban him again from match-day activities against Italy last weekend and England on Saturday. But in an apparent reference to how Mourinho, while serving a ban, snuck into Chelsea\u2019s dressing room to give a team-talk in 2005 before being smuggled out by the kit man, Jones said: \u201cHe might come in a laundry box. That\u2019s been done before hasn\u2019t it? I\u2019m sure he will get in there somehow. The only thing I\u2019d say is that we have to respect the referees and look after the referees. They\u2019re an important part of our game.\u201d Asked if Erasmus\u2019 behaviour is intentionally contributing to South Africa\u2019s siege mentality, Jones added: \u201cWhenever you\u2019ve won something, you need to find the motivation to do it again and maybe it is a clever way to find motivation.\u201d Jones recalled how he was fined A$10,000 dollars for comments he made about a referee while coaching Queensland Reds in 2007, saying he paid it out of his own pocket \u2013 a harsh lesson on the need to bite his tongue. Jones has not always done so as England head coach and was reprimanded by the RFU for comments made about Ben O\u2019Keeffe following his side\u2019s Six Nations win over Wales in 2020. That said, he has largely kept his counsel since in comparison to Erasmus\u2019 outbursts and those of Ronan O\u2019Gara, one of the contenders to succeed him as England head coach, who has just been hit with a 10-match ban \u2013 a fourth separate suspension in the past year. As revealed by the Guardian in September, the RFU is seeking to clampdown on the abuse of match officials at all levels amid a concerning rise in the number of incidents and Jones added: \u201cSince [1998] I have accepted the fact we shouldn\u2019t speak about referees. To me it\u2019s simple. Play the game, the referee\u2019s in charge, if he makes mistakes let\u2019s accept it. If we want to have a contest game, referees are going to make mistakes. If we don\u2019t let\u2019s play basketball, let\u2019s call it basketball. I\u2019m not perfect. \u201cI\u2019ve said things that probably haven\u2019t been right but the longer I\u2019ve coached the more I accept we\u2019ve got to look after the referees.\u201d Jones has made four changes to his side for the weekend encounter with South Africa, with vice-captains Ellis Genge and Jack Nowell dropping to the bench and Mako Vunipola and Tommy Freeman starting in their place. Jamie George and Alex Coles also come into a beefed-up pack. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to meet the challenge of them coming through the front door,\u201d said Jones. \u201cIt\u2019s a different game and we\u2019ve selected a different side to neutralise their strengths and play to our strengths.\u201d"

                    "body": "Graham Arnold claims he does not read the media. It is his response, every time, to every query regarding external praise, criticism or otherwise. But if, hypothetically, he did take a peek from time to time, he might be getting used to hearing he is about to coach the defining match of his career. That match apparently first happened back in March, when the 2-0 loss to Japan consigned the Socceroos to two sudden-death qualifying playoffs and the pressure was so intense Football Australia had to release a statement clarifying his job was not in jeopardy. It came again in June, before he defied expectations and won a playoff against the United Arab Emirates, and then again before Australia beat Peru on a penalty shootout to qualify \u2013 finally \u2013 for Qatar 2022.  It should come as no surprise, then, that Wednesday\u2019s tournament-opening loss to France was also the game. And that the game is also this Saturday, when the team face Tunisia to save their campaign. Managers can live and die on single results. Sacked in a heartbeat or etched into stone as a living legend. Peru was a case in point. That spectacular goalkeeper substitution stunt, had it not come off, might have rendered him persona non grata. The coach who failed to qualify for a fifth consecutive World Cup via a witless tempting of fate. An upset win over France, conversely, would have been one of Australian football\u2019s eminent achievements. That it did not occur has, predictably, triggered the usual conniptions about Arnold\u2019s tactical failures. For his inability to engineer a more aggressive approach. The problem with measuring aggression in this scenario is that they were facing France. As in France, the defending champions. As in the cream of AC Milan, Paris Saint-Germain, Atl\u00e9tico Madrid and Barcelona racing towards an Australian backline who play for Hearts, Dundee United and Stoke. One can attempt to be aggressive and still be pinned back, slit open, executed by a team which is simply better at football. \u201cThat was the intention against France, [to be] much higher up the field like we started,\u201d Arnold says. \u201cThe first 30 minutes, we\u2019ve got to do that for 90. But when you turn over possession so cheaply you get pushed back. That\u2019s a technical side we need to work on. We don\u2019t have time to work on that, but that\u2019s what their ability is.\u201d That Australia opened the scoring against a side of this calibre, with a goal so technically and aesthetically pleasing, is not insignificant in itself. Saudi Arabia declared a public holiday when they beat Argentina on Tuesday. It was one of the biggest World Cup upsets in living memory. They had 30% possession. Herv\u00e9 Renard was hailed as a genius. The Saudis have invested billions in football. It is put to Arnold that perhaps Australia should have kept at France like Japan did at Germany \u2013 the tournament\u2019s other major upset thus far. \u201cJapan had 26% possession and they sat deep the whole time,\u201d he responds. That statistic is correct. Japan has invested hundreds of millions in football. The Socceroos finished behind both Saudi Arabia and Japan in their qualifying group. They have not received a cent from Sport Australia this year. Is there anything more to say? Perhaps something about defending set pieces, maybe something else about the timing and identities of some of the substitutes. There might be more if the opposition were not France. Which brings us to the career-defining match. Tunisia are ranked eight places higher than Australia. They also proved against Denmark they are not that easy to beat. To do so would add an outstanding accomplishment to Arnold\u2019s other accomplishments. To fail would not be a verdict on the entirety of his life\u2019s work.  The 59-year-old has played for clubs in Belgium, the Netherlands and Japan and scored 19 international goals across 56 caps. As a manager he has won domestic club trophies and is recognised as one of Australia\u2019s best to date. But there is something about the national team that resonates more with the public consciousness and weighs heavier on the shoulders of its overseer. His first stint in charge, after serving as assistant to Guus Hiddink at the 2006 World Cup, was not a happy one. His second coming has also been difficult, marred by Covid-19 and steering a young, inexperienced squad through an arduous 20-game journey to qualification. But he has also taken charge of the under-23s to help the inevitable transition and got them to a first Olympics in 12 years. Now he has a chance to lead the senior contingent to a first win at a World Cup since 2010. \u201cIt\u2019s not for me, it\u2019s for the nation. You know, two wins in 17 games [at World Cup finals]. There\u2019s nothing more that I want than to put a smile on all Australian faces. It\u2019s not about me at all. If it was about me, I probably would\u2019ve left ages ago. It\u2019s about helping the kids.\u201d Arnold is asked about the criticism from back home over the past few days. \u201cI don\u2019t know what they\u2019re saying,\u201d he says. After all, he doesn\u2019t read a thing."

Without crowds, sport had lacked a pulse. With their return, Team Australia re-emerged stronger, closer, deeper principled and needing (and finding) fresh inspiration. Australia\u2019s athletes had missed the fans as fans had missed them: the adulation and fanfare, the noise and clamour, the privilege of representing others with their deeds on and off the field.  In 2022, Australia\u2019s athletes took their cue from Peter Norman\u2019s vow to fellow medallists Tommy Burns and John Carlos before their Black Power protest at the 1968 Olympics, an action that won this year\u2019s Sport Australia Dawn award for \u201ccourage that challenged the status quo\u201d. United on the dais and in their humanity, Norman promised: \u201cI\u2019ll stand with you.\u201d The first to stand together were proud Indigenous women Ash Barty and Evonne Goolagong. In summer, Barty became the first homegrown Australian Open champion since Goolagong in 1978, and their joyful, tearful embrace with the trophy was a beautiful unifying moment. So too the Open victory of Nick Kyrgios and Thanasi Kokkinakis, friends in each other\u2019s adversity and now major doubles champions. When wheelchair tennis titan Dylan Alcott became the first person with a disability named as Australian of the Year, national spirits were soaring.  Alas, autumn brought the fall. Barty, 25 and at the peak of her powers, shocked the world by retiring. Then Shane Warne, so full of life and larrikinism, died suddenly aged 52, leaving behind three kids, 708 Test wickets and fans in places high and low. It came 24 hours after another cricket great, Rod Marsh, succumbed to a heart attack. Australia stood united in sporting grief. The MCG\u2019s Great Southern Stand was renamed for Warne and Pat Cummins\u2019 men sang Marsh\u2019s Under the Southern Cross to his statue at Adelaide Oval in November. Australians came together again, this time in celebration, when Lance Franklin \u2013 an Australian rules football legend born in Perth, forged in Melbourne and canonised in Sydney \u2013 kicked his 1,000th goal. It banished the spectre of Covid, unleashing a torrent of happy humanity on to the SCG to share the turf and moment with a people\u2019s champion. Daisy Pearce was chaired off by fans too, after a long-coveted, much-deserved flag in the year\u2019s second AFLW grand final.  Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup  When it came to following Norman\u2019s lead and speaking out on China\u2019s human rights abuses, Australia\u2019s women led the way at the Beijing Winter Olympics, in representation (52%) and achievement with Jakara Anthony\u2019s gold in freestyle mogul skiing, Jaclyn Narracott\u2019s silver in the skeleton and snowboarder Tess Coady taking bronze. Meanwhile, Sam Kerr kept slaying them in the WSL en route to the PFA\u2019s player of the year award, Alyssa Healy\u2019s unbeaten 170 won Australia a seventh ODI World Cup and Steph Gilmore won an eighth world surfing title.  It was a winter of discontent. Australia won 67 Commonwealth Games gold medals (six alone for Emma McKeon) but Hancock Prospecting\u2019s sponsorship of the swimmers muddied the waters for many. Kyrgios caterwauled into the Wimbledon final but a new villain \u2013 mulleted maestro Cameron Smith \u2013 celebrated a back-nine 30 to win the British Open by joining the LIV Tour, in a win for Saudi sportswashing and what some saw as a money-over-morals defection endorsed by the South Australian government who welcome LIV\u2019s first Australian event next April.  As Queensland sprang another State of Origin upset and the Kangaroos and Jillaroos won Rugby League World Cups, Australia\u2019s sevens women took the triple crown (World Cup, Commonwealth Games gold, World Series) and Geelong and Penrith justly won AFL and NRL premierships. The Wallabies went within a whisker of beating the All Blacks, world No 1 Ireland and white-hot France but their most meaningful victories were community triumphs: singing the national anthem in Yugambeh and publicly honouring captain Michael Hooper\u2019s courage in leaving camp to attend to \u201cmindset\u201d issues by then blitzing the world champion Springboks.  The Socceroos had hung tough on a low road to World Cup qualification. After 20 matches and 1,008 days on the road, Australia\u2019s quest for a fifth finals appearance \u2013 and Graham Arnold\u2019s tenure as coach \u2013 looked over until the coach subbed in Andrew Redmayne for the penalty shootout against Peru. Jumping and jiving, gurning in goal from behind a red beard, the \u201cGrey Wiggle\u201d saved the spot kick \u2013 and the Socceroos \u2013 setting Australia up for a thrilling run in Qatar, where they won back-to-back games and crashed the last 16. Just as inspiring was the team\u2019s world-first video standing with LGBTQI+ communities against Qatar\u2019s hardline lawmakers. Less so, the chaotic scenes during the Melbourne derby that sucked away any goodwill the game had garnered of late. Australia\u2019s netballers did what their swimmers didn\u2019t, making a stand over a $15m deal from Big Mining in loyalty to Indigenous teammate Donnell Wallam, a stance rewarded in instant karma when Wallam then nailed the winner on debut against England. As retired Wallabies captain turned senator David Pocock fought more sportswashers in parliament, Cummins stood with him, refusing to spruik Cricket Australia\u2019s major energy sponsor, organising a Cricket for Climate forum that will see 4,000 cricket clubs introduce solar panels to reduce the sport\u2019s footprint and leading his men in traditional earthing ceremonies and taking a knee during this summer\u2019s series. These might appear to be small wins in a big world still fighting its way into the light in 2022. But when there\u2019s a triumph of the human spirit behind every victory, everyone\u2019s a winner."

                    "body": "Harry Maguire frames it differently and it is some difference. His England teammates, when questioned in Qatar, have mostly said they can win the World Cup. It is the objective. They have not shied away from saying so. For Maguire, though, it goes beyond that. It is not only a target. As he prepares for Saturday night\u2019s quarter-final against France, it is an obligation.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the one thing I\u2019d say is a lot different from the 2018 squad,\u201d Maguire says. \u201cI played when we got to the semi-final and a lot of the lads were happy. You knew that whatever happened in that semi-final [when they lost to Croatia], you\u2019d go home and be classed as a hero; you\u2019d get a good reception, everyone would be patting you on the back. Now there\u2019s a belief that we\u2019ve got to win this tournament.\n\u201cOf course we know how tough it is going to be. There are probably five or six teams with the same belief. But in 2018 we probably weren\u2019t one of those teams. Now there\u2019s five or six who have that belief and we\u2019re one of them.\u201d\n\nWhen considering Maguire or talking to him, it is impossible not to fixate on his mentality. Or, to put it another way, wonder how he copes with it all because, over the past year and a bit, Maguire has become a virtual by-word for calamity. That has to do something to a player, even one as long in the tooth as him.\nIt was a horrible season for him last time out. Manchester United were surely the worst version of themselves since the late 1980s and Maguire was a big part of that, making grisly errors. He looked leaden-footed, his confidence on the floor. But as the captain, he almost became the face of the listing ship.\n\nMaguire\u2019s substitution against Atl\u00e9tico Madrid in the Champions League was cheered by a section of the Old Trafford crowd. For England, meanwhile, he was jeered at Wembley during the friendly against the Ivory Coast. Sticks and stones, perhaps. But then came the bomb threat to his family home, which was beyond the pale.\nThis season the abuse has not been as bad and maybe it is because he has not been seen as often. Dropped after the first two games by the new United manager, Erik ten Hag, Maguire has started only three times since \u2013 all at Old Trafford; Real Sociedad (Europa League defeat), West Ham (Premier League win), Aston Villa (Carabao Cup win).\nMaguire was in at the outset for England in late September against Italy and Germany \u2013 he was poor in the second tie \u2013 and after that was unavailable for three weeks or so because of a thigh injury. When he departed for the World Cup, he was United\u2019s fourth-choice centre-half and there were plenty of people who did not want him in the lineup when England got underway against Iran. So how does he cope?\n\n\u201cFirst and foremost, I listen to people around me like my family and friends, my teammates, the staff here,\u201d Maguire says. \u201cI know how valued I am, I feel it within the camp. That gives me great belief. I also go back to my past memories and performances at tournaments. In the summer of last year I was in the Euros team of the tournament. I know what I\u2019m capable of.\u201d\nIt has to be hard to blot out all of the noise. Maguire cannot live under a rock. Last week he was even ridiculed in the Ghanaian parliament when an MP denigrated the vice-president as the \u201ceconomic Maguire\u201d, accusing him of being a liability.\n\n\u201cYou pick up bits and bobs and maybe my family read things more than me,\u201d Maguire says. \u201cI tell them to stay off social media \u2013 maybe they don\u2019t because it\u2019s a habit for most people these days. But I\u2019m 29 years old, I\u2019m the captain of Man United and I\u2019ve made 52 appearances for my country. I\u2019m doing everything I always wanted to do.\n\u201cDuring a career there\u2019s only probably Lionel Messi and Cristiano [Ronaldo] who\u2019ve not had a dip. There\u2019s no way, especially with all the scrutiny that is on defences these days, you\u2019re not going to have dips. It\u2019s how you bounce back from them.\u201d\nMaguire has had a good World Cup so far, starting all four of England\u2019s ties, although he did have shaky moments during the early stages of the last-16 win against Senegal. He has felt the support of not only Southgate but the travelling fans, making light of his lack of regular football much as he did going into the last Euros; back then he was out for six weeks with an ankle problem. He has also received a couple of \u201cwell done\u201d messages from Ten Hag.\n\n\u201cAs a player you want to play and this is the first season I\u2019ve really sat on a bench in a few games,\u201d Maguire says. \u201cBut I\u2019ll fight to get my place back [at United]. I did manage to play the 90 minutes against West Ham and Villa after my thigh injury and I felt like I was coming into a little bit of form. You want to play in your rhythm and I\u2019m glad I got the first few World Cup games out of the way. I\u2019m in a rhythm of playing now. I\u2019m in a good place.\u201d\nThis is not a redemption story. Not yet, anyway. The fear continues to lurk that Maguire could be exposed against France, particularly by the pace of Kylian Mbapp\u00e9. But just imagine if Maguire could summon a command performance in victory. This is his life \u2013 ever on the end of a precipice. How does he cope? All told, pretty remarkably."

                    "body": "The oddity of this Argentina side is that it arrived in Qatar having gone 36 games unbeaten and yet has still found itself making it up as it went along. For once there seemed no questions about selection. There were few doubts about how Argentina should play or who should play up front with Lionel Messi, even after the injury to Giovani Lo Celso. There was a sense of stability and a quiet confidence. They had won the Copa Am\u00e9rica last year. There was no need to change anything. Then they lost to Saudi Arabia.\nArgentina are habitually poor starters at World Cups. In 40 years their only really impressive opening performance was the 4-0 win over Greece in 1994 and that culminated in Diego Maradona failing the drug test that would end his international career.\nThe defeat by Saudi Arabia caused panic. Argentina had enough chances in the first half to win it, they dominated the xG, had a goal ruled out for the tightest of offsides and the two Saudi goals in four minutes came against the run of play.\n\nWhat cost Argentina was not the first half in which their only real fault was playing a little too quickly, snatching at the game, but the meltdown that followed.\nA sober assessment might have been that they just needed to play the same way but more calmly. But an accumulation of failure, memory of past embarrassment, the need to win Messi his World Cup, led to the brink of desperation and demands for change. Far more than in the club game, in international football the present lives always in the shadow of the past. Ripping up blueprints has been an Argentinian habit at World Cups.\nEven in 2014, when they last reached the final, the talk had all been of a 4-3-3 only for them to line up against Bosnia-Herzegovina in a 5-3-2, apparently because Messi wanted to play more centrally. They spent the rest of that World Cup fumbling from shape to shape. In 2018 it was no better, the back three hastily adopted against Croatia bringing a crushing 3-0 defeat. But the difference this time, as Jorge Valdano has said, is that the early defeat has probably been beneficial. The change it provoked was necessary.\n\nIt is one of the great paradoxes of football: if winning leads to stagnation, a sense that there is no need to adapt or evolve, then success leads ultimately to failure. Things have to change to stay the same. Long unbeaten runs, as Xabi Alonso acknowledged after Spain\u2019s ended against the USA at the 2009 Confederations Cup, can become a burden. Protecting the run starts to interfere with the specific business of that match and there is an inevitable reluctance to tinker with a side that in being unbeaten comes to seem unbeatable.\nThe Saudi defeat opened the door to change and through it have come Alexis Mac Allister, Enzo Fern\u00e1ndez and Juli\u00e1n \u00c1lvarez, three young players who were not in the reckoning when the long unbeaten run began. Mac Allister is 23. He was first called up in 2019, only for injury and Covid to get in the way. Fern\u00e1ndez is 21 and won his first cap only in September. \u00c1lvarez is 22 and made his Argentina debut in June last year. Mac Allister and Fern\u00e1ndez have added snap and intelligence to the midfield while \u00c1lvarez is a mobile and skilful foil for Messi. Crucially, unlike Lautaro Mart\u00ednez who missed chance after chance against Australia, he seems capable of scoring goals, four so far at the World Cup.\nThere is a proud lineage of forwards emerging over the course of a World Cup having initially not been in the side: Toto Schillaci in 1990, Geoff Hurst in 1966, Pel\u00e9 in 1958.\nSchillaci did not start for Italy until the third group game in 1990 but by the end of the tournament he had won both the Golden Boot and the Golden Ball. For all the planning that goes into the modern game there is still space for an in-form player to arrive and make a huge difference, particularly in a tournament when the football is less sophisticated or as controlled as at club level, and momentum and confidence more of a factor.\nBut \u00c1lvarez is far more than just a finisher. His goal against Australia demonstrated great awareness to seize on Mat Ryan\u2019s error and then squeeze in his shot, while his second against Croatia in the semi-final, arriving on Messi\u2019s cutback, was a classic centre-forward\u2019s goal. His first strike of the tournament, turning in the box against Poland and arcing a finish into the top corner, was admirably fluent and precise.\n\nIt was his first in the semi-final, though, that stood out. It was an odd goal, hard to define, scruffy yet requiring great balance and technical ability as he bounced through a series of challenges before poking the ball in. It was not a goal, it is fair to say, practised on the training field, not the result of an intricately plotted move. Yet for Argentina, a country besotted by its own history, it had its precursor in Mario Kempes\u2019s second goal against the Netherlands in the final in 1978.\nNo country is so in love with its origin myth as Argentina, with all its talk of pibes developing their skills and their cunning on the unruly vacant lots of the city. This felt like a goal of the streets. \u00c1lvarez does not quite fit the stereotype in that he grew up not in Buenos Aires but in the small village of Calch\u00edn in the province of C\u00f3rdoba, but he was trained by a van driver and his talent did, in the approved manner, first become clear when at a very young age he beat five players to score.\n\u00c1lvarez evokes the ancient spirit of the Argentinian game but the fact he plays under Pep Guardiola at Manchester City is enough to define him as a very modern forward. But he is more than that: he is confident and in form and he is part of the injection of young talent that might be about to make Argentina world champions again, part of the change that can resurrect old glories."

                    "body": "Hundreds of Iranian fans arrived at Doha\u2019s Khalifah stadium on Monday with a secret: they wanted their national team to lose. \u201cIn my heart, I don\u2019t want them to win,\u201d said Mokhtar, 59, wincing visibly at the admission. The propaganda value of defeating Iran\u2019s former colonial master, England, would simply be too irresistible for the country\u2019s embattled rulers, he said.  \u201cThe players would go home and meet the president, they would be celebrated by the mullahs,\u201d he said. The Iranian colours painted on his face were starting to crack in the afternoon sun. \u201cI still hope they score a lot of goals,\u201d he said. \u201cBut then lose.\u201d For many Iranians, everything now is about the popular uprising that has been roiling their country for the past two months and left hundreds of protesters dead, including dozens of children. The country\u2019s World Cup campaign in Qatar is not immune. The squad flew to Doha last week under a cloud of popular criticism after meeting the Iranian president, Ebrahim Raisi, with some players pictured bowing to the hardliner. \u201cMany say this isn\u2019t our national team,\u201d said Ali, 42 from Qom. His Iranian national team shirt was splattered with an illustration of several bullet holes, with a bloody handprint on the back. \u201cI think they were forced [to meet the president]. If the players don\u2019t sing the national anthem today, maybe people will forgive them.\u201d  As Iran\u2019s national anthem was played before kick-off, fans sounded their horns in defiance and loud boos echoed throughout the stadium. Iran\u2019s squad linked arms and stared into the distance, none uttering a word as fans, some in tears, applauded their silent gesture. Signs of the uprising were everywhere outside the stadium. The largest cluster of Iranian fans danced with the lion-and-sun flag of the country\u2019s pre-revolutionary government. Dozens lined up for photos with the ensign, banned in the country since 1979. One English fan watched on, a little bemused, applying sunscreen to his face. \u201cI haven\u2019t been following it in granular detail, to be honest,\u201d he said. Several people were stopped from bringing the flag into the stadium due to a Fifa restrictions on political statements, but Dani Elahi managed to get his inside anyway. \u201cI snuck it in,\u201d the Iranian-American said. \u201cI had it out the whole game.\u201d The Iranian football legend Ali Karimi has not played a match in eight years, but outside Khalifa Stadium on Monday afternoon, hundreds wore his name on the back of their team shirts. Karimi has been one of Iran\u2019s most outspoken public figures condemning the treatment of Mahsa Amini, the 21-year-old woman who was arrested by the country\u2019s morality police and died in hospital days later, the trigger for the nationwide protests that are now in their third month. The former Iranian national captain, who lives in Dubai, has been charged with national security crimes in absentia. Sitting in the shade at the boundary of the stadium, two young women in Iran shirts were using markers to carefully spell out \u201cfreedom\u201d in their palm of their hands. \u201cWe hope for victory for the other team, because this team is not representative,\u201d one said. She was from Shiraz and had reserved her tickets and booked flights before the uprising had started. \u201cThese aren\u2019t good days for Iran, and this team doesn\u2019t support us,\u201d she said. She gave her name, then after a few seconds reconsidered. \u201cIt\u2019s not safe,\u201d she said. \u201cCall us both Mahsa. We are all Mahsa Amini.\u201d Another trio wore sunglasses painted in the Iranian colours and bright red shirts, each emblazoned with a single word of the phrase \u201cWomen, life and liberty, which has become the uprising\u2019s main slogan, and was written across placards held aloft across the stadium. \u201cThe Ukrainian football team, they support their people,\u201d said Ehsan, from Tehran. \u201cBut our team doesn\u2019t. We aren\u2019t motivated to be in Qatar, but this is our duty. Honestly? I support England.\u201d If there were any supporters of the Iranian regime among the crowds, he added, none had approached him to make it known. \u201cThey keep quiet. Over there they have the power,\u201d he said. \u201cOutside Iran, we are the majority.\u201d"

                    "body": "Netherlands 4-0 Argentina: 1974 second group stage\nThe first World Cup meeting between the sides is not one Argentina will remember with fondness. They are ruthlessly torn apart in Gelsenkirchen by the brilliant Johan Cruyff-inspired Oranje, whose collective vision, movement and passing patterns are complemented by steely tackling and defensive discipline. Cruyff dances around the goalkeeper, Daniel Carnevali, to roll in the first after latching on to Johan Neeskens\u2019s chipped pass; it is the defender Wim Rijsbergen\u2019s crunching challenge that sets the platform for the attack. Ruud Krol soon rockets in the second from the edge of the area after a corner. In the second half, Cruyff whips an immaculate cross to the far post where Johnny Rep\u2019s bullet header makes it 3-0. On the sidelines, the Netherlands manager, Rinus Michels, laughs, claps and rubs his hands with glee. In the last minute, after yet another fluent passing move, Wim van Hanegem\u2019s close-range shot is beaten out by Carnevali, only for Cruyff to audaciously volley in from an angle. For a proud footballing nation such as Argentina it is particularly painful to be taught a lesson in such emphatic fashion. Total football; total domination.\n\nArgentina 3-1 Netherlands: 1978 final\n\nMuch like Qatar 2022, the 1978 tournament in Argentina is seriously tarnished by concerns over human rights abuses in the host nation: in this case the murderous military dictatorship of Jorge Rafael Videla. Before the tournament there is an international campaign for a boycott. Cruyff chooses not to play, but his decision is prompted mainly by a violent kidnapping attempt on him and his family in Barcelona rather than any political sensibilities. Rijsbergen and his teammate Wim Suurbier, instructed to ride bicycles while recovering from injuries during the tournament, visit Plaza de Mayo in Buenos Aires, to witness protests by the mothers of the disappeared. By the end of the final Videla has achieved his dual goal: legitimisation of his regime by hosting the World Cup and for Argentina to be champions. In a narrower sporting sense, the victory is revenge for Argentina\u2019s thrashing four years previously. After Mario Kempes slides in the opening goal, Dirk Nanninga\u2019s header forces extra time. Another from Kempes and a third by Daniel Bertoni crush the dreams of the Netherlands, who lose a second straight World Cup final.\n\nNetherlands 2-1 Argentina: 1998 quarter-final\nPatrick Kluivert\u2019s opener in Marseille is created by a wonderfully perceptive cushioned header by Dennis Bergkamp. Five minutes later, Argentina\u2019s equaliser arrives when the Netherlands botch their offside trap and Claudio L\u00f3pez sprints through one-on-one, patiently waiting for his moment before passing the ball through Edwin van der Sar\u2019s legs. Both teams are reduced to 10 men \u2013 Arthur Numan takes a second booking after fouling Diego Simeone while Ariel Ortega is sent off after clashing with Van der Sar three minutes from full-time. In the final minute, Argentina appear to have resigned themselves to extra time. They are content to let Frank de Boer advance towards halfway, backing off and allowing him time and space. It proves a costly error. De Boer drills a long diagonal pass, left to right, aimed at his former Ajax teammate Bergkamp. The Arsenal forward requires three touches with his right boot: the first to bring the ball perfectly under control after it floats over his left shoulder, another to cut back inside the covering run of the centre-back Roberto Ayala and a third to clip an expertly executed shot into the far corner beyond the helpless Carlos Roa in goal. An iconic moment and one of the greatest World Cup goals. \u201cA dream,\u201d De Boer would later say.\n\nNetherlands 0-0 Argentina: 2006 group stage\nBoth sides have defeated Ivory Coast and Serbia &amp; Montenegro in Group C: as a result they have qualified for the knockout stages, with multiple changes made by Marco van Basten and Jos\u00e9 Pekerman. The least memorable World Cup meeting between the nations is the result, although Argentina have the better of it, Carlos Tevez hitting the woodwork and Juan Rom\u00e1n Riquelme shooting narrowly wide a couple of times. The stalemate means Argentina top the group and progress to meet Mexico, while the Netherlands book a last-16 date against Portugal. Had Van Basten and the Netherlands known what awaited in the knockouts they might have tried harder to win the group: the Slag van Neurenberg (Battle of Nuremberg) against Portugal would lead to them being eliminated by Maniche\u2019s solitary goal in a match featuring a record four red cards and 16 yellows.\n\nNetherlands 0-0 Argentina aet (2-4 pens): 2014 semi-final\n\nA renewal of a classic rivalry but far from a classic match. Defences stay in control for 120 minutes of a S\u00e3o Paulo semi-final the Guardian\u2019s match report describes as \u201cwretched\u201d, \u201cdreary\u201d and \u201ca stinker\u201d. Aside from a first-half free-kick hit straight at the goalkeeper, Jasper Cillessen, Lionel Messi is largely kept quiet and the Netherlands winger Arjen Robben is denied by an excellent sliding tackle by Javier Mascherano as full-time approaches. Rodrigo Palacio should win it with five minutes of extra time remaining but tries to head Messi\u2019s bouncing through ball rather than take it on the half-volley. In the Netherlands\u2019 quarter-final penalty shootout victory against Costa Rica Louis van Gaal replaced Cillessen with Tim Krul in the 120th minute. Krul saved two spot-kicks and the decision was recognised as a high-risk managerial masterstroke. This time, however, Van Gaal has used his three permitted substitutes. Argentina\u2019s Sergio Romero saves from Ron Vlaar and Wesley Sneijder, leaving Maxi Rodr\u00edguez to smash a shot through Cillessen\u2019s hands and send Argentina to the final. \u201cI taught Romero how to stop penalties [at AZ Alkmaar],\u201d says Van Gaal. \u201cSo that hurts.\u201d\n"

                    "body": "\u201cBefore Niklas Fullkrug\u2019s equaliser against Spain, it looked like Germany would lose their first two games yet still potentially go through. Has this happened at a World Cup before? And, if not, which team that qualified for the knockout rounds has the worst record after two group games?\u201d asks Amanda Jackson. The short answer is no, though it did happen at the European Championship last year when Denmark recovered from two defeats and the shock of Christian Eriksen\u2019s cardiac arrest to hammer Russia 4-1 on an unforgettable night in Copenhagen. There have been a few near-misses at the World Cup, particularly in the period from 1986-94 when the structure of the tournament (24 teams, six groups of four) meant the four best third-placed sides qualified for the last 16. In 1990, Austria lost their first two games 1-0 to Italy and Czechoslovakia, then beat the USA 2-1 in the battle of the mullets. Two days later, Daniel Fonseca\u2019s injury-time winner for Uruguay against South Korea sent Austria (and Scotland, for that matter) out. Had Fonseca not scored, Austria and Scotland \u2013 who had an identical record and finished third in their group \u2013 would have drawn lots to see who went through. It was all pretty complicated and it still gives us a headache 32 years later. In the same tournament, the Soviet Union would have qualified from Group B despite losing their first two games had Romania and Argentina not drawn their final match. That\u2019s because the Soviets whipped Cameroon 4-0 in their final game and goal difference rather than head-to-head results was used to separate teams. Had Romania beaten Argentina 1-0, or vice versa, the Soviet Union would have finished third in their group and ahead of Austria and Scotland in the third-place table on goal difference. We think 10 teams have qualified after taking a single point from their first two games. Uruguay managed it at consecutive World Cups in 1986 and 1990. At Mexico 86, in one of the first celebrated groups of death, they drew 1-1 with West Germany before being demolished 6-1 by Denmark.  Jos\u00e9 Batista was sent off in the first minute of Uruguay\u2019s final game against Scotland, but they held on for the 0-0 draw that put them through. Two points was enough to finish above Hungary \u2013 who had an even worse goal difference after losing 6-0 to the USSR and 3-0 to France \u2013 and Northern Ireland in the third-place mini-league. Had Scotland won, they would have reached the last 16 despite losing their first two matches. Instead, their Mexico 86 legacy was a quote: the SFA secretary Ernie Walker described Uruguay as \u201cthe scum of world football\u201d. Uruguay\u2019s record after two games (one point, -5 goal difference) is the worst of any team to qualify from the group stage. Plenty of others had one point but a less bruising goal difference. The list includes Argentina in 1974, England in 1986 (0-1 v Portugal, 0-0 v Morocco, 3-0 v Poland with a life-changing Gary Lineker hat-trick), Paraguay and Turkey in 2002, Slovakia in 2010, Greece in 2014 and Argentina again in 2018. Turkey went on reach the semi-finals 20 years ago, making them the highest achievers of this peculiar group. But the most famous example comes from 1966. North Korea started their first World Cup inauspiciously with a 3-0 defeat by the Soviet Union. Then they drew 1-1 with Chile in what most people assumed was a wooden-spoon match. Wrong. In their final game, North Korea produced an upset for the ages, beating Italy 1-0 at Ayresome Park to reach the quarter-finals.  Do you remember the first time?  Jude Bellingham, Bukayo Saka, Raheem Sterling, Marcus Rashford and Jack Grealish scored their first World Cup goals against Iran. It was certainly a record for England at the World Cup \u2013 the previous best was two \u2013 but not overall. Before we get to sixes and sevens, there are a handful of other teams with five new scorers in a World Cup game.  Uruguay 8-0 Bolivia (1954) Hungary 9-0 South Korea (1954) Germany 8-0 Saudi Arabia (2002)  Germany\u2019s win included a hat-trick for Miroslav Klose, who would go on to become the World Cup\u2019s all-time leading goalscorer with 16.  Two teams have had six players scoring their first World Cup goal in the same match: Hungary, when they beat El Salvador 10-1 in 1982, and Spain when they eviscerated Costa Rica 7-0 last Wednesday. Dani Olmo, Marco Asensio, Ferran Torres, Gavi, Carlos Soler and \u00c1lvaro Morata all achieved a lifetime ambition and we don\u2019t mean scoring past Keylor Navas. But this particular record belongs to Yugoslavia, who had seven different scorers \u2013 all of them World Cup virgins \u2013 in their 9-0 win over Zaire in 1974: Dusan Bajevic \u2013 who scored a hat-trick \u2013 Dragan Dzajic, Ivica Surjak, Josip Katalinski, Vladislav Bogicevic, Branko Oblak and Ilija Petkovic. Good luck beating that against a low block.  Lower-league players at the World Cup (2) In last week\u2019s Knowledge, we looked at people who went to the World Cup while playing in the lower leagues. Here are some more \u2026 Cameroon 1982Ibrahim Aoudou and Paul Bahoken played for second-tier Bastia in France.

Northern Ireland 1982Not technically lower league, but worth a mention. \u201cNorthern Ireland had four Irish League players in their squad: Johnny Jameson (Glentoran), Felix Healy (Coleraine), Jim Cleary (Glentoran) and George Dunlop (Linfield),\u201d writes Simon Topping. \u201cHealy came on as a late sub in our second game against Honduras becoming the first (and probably last) Irish League player to feature in a World Cup game.\u201d Cameroon 1990Benjamin Massing (US Creteil), Francois Omam-Biyik (Stade Lavallois), Eugene Ekeke (Valenciennes) and Jean-Claude Pagal (La Roche Vendee) played in the second tier of French football. Republic of Ireland 1990Alan McLoughlin (Swindon), Bernie Slaven (Middlesbrough), Mick McCarthy (Millwall), David Kelly (Leicester), Kevin Moran and Frank Stapleton (both Blackburns) and John Sheridan (Sheffield Wednesday) were in the English second tier. Gerry Peyton (Bournemouth) had just been relegated to the third. Norway 1994Gunnar Halle (Oldham), Jostein Flo and Roger Nilsen (both Sheffield United) and Jan Aage Fjortoft (Swindon) were all relegated to the second tier just before the World Cup.  Republic of Ireland 1994As well as John Aldridge, who we mentioned last week, Alan McLoughlin (Portsmouth), Jason McAteer (Bolton), David Kelly (Wolves) and Alan Kelly (Sheffield United) were at second-tier clubs. Morocco 2018Wahbi Khazri technically played for Sunderland, who had just been relegated to the third tier, though he had spent the season on loan at Rennes and joined Saint-Etienne after the World Cup. Next up \u2026  The overlap \u201cAndr\u00e9s Guardado and Lionel Messi featured in Argentina v Mexico at the 2006 World Cup and 2022 \u2013 fixtures that were 5,999 days apart,\u201d mails James McWilliam Woods. \u201cAre there examples of players featuring for the same opposing teams in fixtures with a larger gap between them?\u201d Although they weren\u2019t on the pitch at the same time in 2006 \u2013 Guardado came off in the 66th minute, 18 minutes before Messi replaced Javier Saviola \u2013 it\u2019s still a very good question. We\u2019re 99.94% sure it\u2019s a record for the World Cup, because the other players who have appeared at five tournaments either didn\u2019t overlap or their teams didn\u2019t meet each other. They are Antonio Carbajal (Mexico, 1950-66), Lothar Matthaus (West Germany/Germany, 1982-98), Rafael M\u00e1rquez (Mexico, 2002-18) and Cristiano Ronaldo (Portugal, 2006-22).  Knowledge archive \u201cIs it true that Chilean players drank vodka during the 1962 World Cup because they thought it would help their chances of beating the USSR?\u201d asked Steven Davison in 2006. Incredibly, Steven, it is. During the group stage, the hosts employed an interesting new tactic of pre-game stereotypical eating: before the opening 3-1 win over Switzerland, they ate cheese, followed by a preparatory meal of spaghetti before the 2-0 success against Italy. Once in the quarter-finals, the Chileans prepared for their game with the mighty Union of Soviet Socialist Republics by downing a couple of Smirnoffs. Chile went on to win 2-1. Coffee was the order of the day before the semi-final with Brazil, but although it perked them up no end in the morning, it couldn\u2019t stop the Brazilians from winning 4-2 and going on to lift the trophy. Eduardo Galeano wrote in Soccer in Sun and Shadow that Chile \u201cgobbled down spaghetti, chocolate, and vodka, but choked on the coffee\u201d.  Can you help? \u201cDia, Diedhiou and Dieng scored for Senegal against Qatar. Has there ever been a game with three or more goals from a team with scorers more closely grouped in alphabetical (and temporal) order? Phone-book football \u2026\u201d writes Mike King.  \u201cSerbia (and its predecesssor Yugoslavia) haven\u2019t beaten Brazil since 1934. Is this 88-year wait the longest for any international team against the same opponent?\u201d asks Bogdan Kotarlic.  \u201cFive of the captains at this World Cup have played for Spurs: Harry Kane, Son Heung-min, Hugo Lloris, Gareth Bale and Luka Modric. What\u2019s the record for one club at a single World Cup?\u201d wonders Owen Powell. Mail us your questions or tweet @TheKnowledge_GU."

We came tonight to thank the players and to show them how proud we are of them.\u201d\n\nSigns showing appreciation and pride in the players littered the crowd, with many fans saying they had come just to show the players some love after a difficult loss.\n\u201cWe came down to support the boys tonight,\u201d Michael, another fan, said. \u201cWe want to show them how much we love them, they\u2019ve done an amazing job, no matter the result.\u201d\nOthers said they hoped the Socceroos\u2019 success would translate into momentum for the A-League, where a portion of Australia\u2019s squad plays.\n\nMichelle, an A-League fan, said Australia\u2019s successful campaign reflected just how good the standard was in the national competition.\n\u201cWhat makes it amazing is that a majority of the players come from the A-League or have played in the league, and as an avid fan it was awesome to see them do so well and to see everyone watch them,\u201d she said.\n\u201cHopefully this means they\u2019ll come along to A-League and W-League matches as well.\u201d\nShe said the huge turnouts and passionate support at live viewing sites reflected a country that had already embraced the Socceroos and the sport itself.\n\u201cThe atmosphere was incredible, the turnouts were great, despite what some had to say about the flares that were lit,\u201d Michelle said. \u201cWe\u2019re not hooligans, we just love football.\n\u201cWe just want to see that momentum channelled into the grassroots here, into the game here, and especially in the lead up to the women\u2019s World Cup next year.\u201d\nMomentum was a recurring theme among the returning players as well, with goalkeeper Daniel Vukovic saying it was important the moment was capitalised upon.\n\u201cWe need to keep growing the game in this country, and to capitalise on this moment. And the best way to do that is to go out and support your local team,\u201d he said.\n\u201cThe support we received has been amazing, and we just want to see that continue to grow.\u201d"

                    "body": "Cristiano Ronaldo has said he was close to joining Manchester City but a talk with Sir Alex Ferguson changed his mind. The forward also claimed younger players \u201cdon\u2019t care\u201d as much about football as his generation in his TalkTV interview with Piers Morgan.\nPart one of the interview was aired on Wednesday night, following the drip feed of social media snippets this week. In it, Ronaldo confirmed he had spoken with Ferguson before his return to Manchester United last summer, with his former manager at Old Trafford telling him a move to City was \u201cimpossible\u201d.\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t say that Manchester City wasn\u2019t close,\u201d Ronaldo said. \u201cBut as you know, my history in Manchester United, your heart, you\u2019re feeling the way that you did before, makes the difference. And of course, as well, Sir Alex Ferguson.\n\n\u201cI spoke with him. He said to me \u2018it\u2019s impossible for you to come to Manchester City\u2019. And I say \u2018OK, boss\u2019. I did [make] a conscious decision, and I repeat, I was with conscience that it was a good decision.\u201d\nRonaldo also hit out at younger players making their way through the professional game, claiming \u201cthey don\u2019t suffer \u2013 and they don\u2019t care. Their hunger [is different] \u2026 I think they have things more easily, everything\u2019s easy.\u201d\n\u201cThey don\u2019t care \u2013 some ones, yes, but most of them no,\u201d he added. \u201cBut for me that is not surprising because they are not going to have longevity in their careers. It is impossible. In my generation you see many players reach 36, 37, 38 at a high level and I think this generation you will count on one hand how many will reach that level.\u201d\nEarlier on Wednesday, Rapha\u00ebl Varane has admitted Ronaldo\u2019s interview \u2013 in which he fiercely criticised Manchester United\u2019s owners and the manager, Erik ten Hag \u2013 has sent shockwaves through the squad.\nIn clips released on social media, Ronaldo told Morgan he did not respect Ten Hag and claimed a number of individuals at United were trying to force him out. The 37\u2011year\u2011old forward also claimed the Glazer family, owners since 2005, did not care about the club.\n\nUnited are taking legal advice \u2013 and awaiting broadcast of the full interview \u2013 before issuing a response and while a statement did say their \u201cfocus remains on ... continuing the momentum, belief and togetherness being built\u201d, the effects of the interview are clearly being felt by the rest of the United players.\nVarane, who is preparing for the World Cup with France, told the radio station Europe 1: \u201cObviously it affects us. We follow what is happening and what is being said. We try to calm the situation in our own way, we try not to get too involved in it.\nWhen it\u2019s a star like Ronaldo, even more so we try to take it with distance, that is to say that we do not try to change the situation alone, we are part of a collective. What I want is the best for my team so whatever the decision [by the club], as a player, we will accept it and give the best of ourselves.\u201d\nRonaldo missed training with Portugal on Wednesday because of a stomach bug. It caps an eventful week for the five-time Ballon d\u2019Or winner, who has also been involved in awkward exchanges with his international teammates, Bruno Fernandes and Jo\u00e3o Cancelo. Portugal will get their World Cup campaign under way next week against Ghana.\nMeanwhile, the France squad have announced they have pledged to financially support non\u2011governmental organisations and charities which work towards the protection of human rights.\nThe World Cup has been tainted by the appalling lack of protection for migrant workers who have endured exploitative, even deadly, conditions as Qatar prepared for the tournament while the country\u2019s stance on LGBTQ+ rights has also cast a long shadow over the event.\n\u201cWe are players, we have this way of expressing ourselves, but it\u2019s human that we expressed this through this letter,\u201d said Varane, France\u2019s vice-captain.\u201cIt\u2019s also a lot of light [shone] on us and we also want to express humanly what we feel.\u201d"

                    "body": "Gareth Southgate has admitted that having two years left on his contract will not protect him from the sack if England flop at the World Cup this winter. Southgate, whose deal runs until December 2024 and takes in that year\u2019s European Championship, is under growing pressure before England close their disastrous Nations League campaign by hosting Germany at Wembley on Monday evening. The manager was booed by his own supporters after his side\u2019s 1-0 defeat against Italy in Milan last Friday, a result that relegated the Euro 2020 finalists to the second tier of the Nations League, and the 52-year-old knows his future could depend on what happens in Qatar this winter.  \u201cI am not foolish,\u201d Southgate said. \u201cMy sole focus at the moment is to get the team right for tomorrow and then we are focusing on a good performance and a good result. I know ultimately I will be judged on what happens at that World Cup. \u201cContracts are irrelevant in football because managers can have three-, four-, five\u2011year contracts and you accept that, if results are not good enough it is time to go your separate ways. Why would I be any different? I am not arrogant enough to think that my contract is going to protect me in any way.\u201d England have gone five games without a competitive win for the first time since 1992 and have not scored a goal from open play for 450 minutes. The lack of creativity has become a huge issue and Southgate, who is expected to stick with a 3-4-3 system against Germany, was realistic when it was pointed out that he continues to enjoy firm backing from the Football Association. \u201cI am absolutely appreciative of that,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we understand how the mood changes with the results and has changed. I am realistic about that and I will be judged on what we do in Qatar and I am perfectly happy to be judged in that way. History is history and you are judged on the next match and the next tournament.\u201d Southgate, who could start Luke Shaw and Kieran Trippier in the wing\u2011back positions and recall John Stones in central defence, could do without the Wembley crowd turning on him against Germany. He has united supporters behind him since becoming manager six years ago but the public mood is starting to turn. \u201cPart of the reason we\u2019ve been successful in tournaments has been the feeling of togetherness,\u201d Southgate said. \u201cWe can\u2019t succeed with fans against us, or you guys not feeling warm towards us. It\u2019s harder if we\u2019re having to battle with the opposition and then battle with things on our own island. Only we can rectify that by performances and results.\u201d  Southgate considered the relationship between the press and the England manager. \u201cI have been in football for 30 years,\u201d he said. \u201cI have seen pretty much everything. I have seen the cycle of war with the media. I have seen the absolute love-in and we are somewhere in the middle of that \u2014 or maybe not quite in the middle. That is fascinating to observe from my side and it is a life experience I knew at some stage would probably come with this job.\u201d The spotlight is not merely on Southgate. Many of England\u2019s most important individuals have disappointed and Raheem Sterling said the players have to improve. \u201cResults have not been good enough and we need to take responsibility,\u201d the Chelsea forward said. \u201cI know there has been a lot on Gareth and what he has been doing \u2014 formations and whatnot \u2014 but at the end of the day, the performances have not been right. As a collective we need to put that right.\u201d Sterling scored the opening goal when England defeated Germany 2-0 in the last 16 of Euro 2020. He knows how quickly the picture can change. The 27-year-old forward pointed out that he once dreaded going on international duty. \u201cMy mentality was I need to just focus on myself,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s definitely been something that\u2019s put me in good stead. That\u2019s a message that can definitely go with the squad here in the next couple of months. We know there will be noise and we need to block it out if we are going to do well.\u201d"

                    "body": "\u201cI never thought I\u2019d be here again,\u201d murmured Wayne Smith, gazing around the Eden Park press room and remembering when he last coached in a big World Cup game against France in Auckland. In 2011 the All Blacks narrowly prevailed in a men\u2019s final that the French could have won and a similar scenario duly unfolded with his Black Ferns side on Saturday night. If Smith felt a strong sense of deja vu, he was not alone. Assisting the Black Ferns is Sir Graham Henry, equally familiar with the pressure of World Cup finals. Alongside the pair is Mike Cron, the long-time All Blacks scrum guru, with Dan Carter also on hand to help sharpen the host nation\u2019s kicking. Getting the old gang back together for one last job, it seems, is not solely the preserve of Hollywood movies.  Most interesting of all is the nature of the heist Smith and co are attempting to pull off. Earlier this year the Black Ferns were in disarray, having been humiliated by England on the field last autumn and rocked by an excoriating subsequent review into how the players had been treated. To have made a World Cup final from such unpromising foundations is almost as impressive as the refreshing ethos driving it. Smith, 65 and on his final elite coaching sortie, has essentially instructed his players to abandon the overly structured straitjacket that constrains many teams. He wants them to stay true to their attacking instincts and play without fear. It might prove insufficient in a final against a strong English pack but the rejuvenated Black Ferns are committed to giving it a go. \u201cI know one thing,\u201d says Smith. \u201cThey\u2019ve got heart and they\u2019ll give it a crack.\u201d Look back at most finals and the opposite is frequently true. A lot of teams \u2013 not least the 2011 All Blacks \u2013 simply aim to cling on to what they have and start to play in the most risk-averse way possible. Tiredness, apprehension, a sense of how much is at stake \u2026 all of it inhibits players and encourages them to go into their shells.  Occasionally some teams panic and lurch the other way. In 1991 England had one of the world\u2019s strongest men\u2019s packs but decided the final against Australia at Twickenham was the moment to try to expand their horizons. Such things do not always unfold with a click of the fingers, however, and abandoning a long-established gameplan at the 11th hour is risky. Which brings us to the dilemma currently facing, among others, both the English women\u2019s and men\u2019s national teams. The Red Roses will be loth to jettison what has worked so well for them in Saturday\u2019s sold-out final. The obvious way to go, after 30 consecutive Test wins, is straight up the guts in the expectation their set piece strength and carrying power will stop the Black Ferns at source. The snag, as illustrated by last weekend\u2019s semi-finals, is that champion sides tend to need more flexibility than that. With Canada proving both physical and dynamic, it was just as well for the Red Roses that they had a different breed of match winner out wide. As well as propelling England into the final, Claudia MacDonald\u2019s dancing feet and Abby Dow\u2019s subsequent wonder dash were a reminder that pace can turn big games as much as power. No one is suggesting England should toss the ball around, sevens style, and adopt a loose game that would play straight into New Zealand hands. What is vital, though, is that the Red Roses keep an open mind. If the Black Ferns are the only team with their heads up, scanning for the best available options and thinking for themselves, there is a risk that England\u2019s close-quarter prowess could be undermined.  Twickenham on Sunday offered a classic case study. England had significantly more possession and territory but mostly did little with it beyond deploying individual runners, rugby league style, to bash into Argentinian brick walls. The Pumas soaked it up, kicked their penalties and, when the chance came, launched a quite outstanding backline strike move which ultimately tilted the contest. England, not for the first time, seemed so hung up on the nuts and bolts of their gameplan that instinct and rhythm played scant part until Jack van Poortvliet, having just come on as a replacement, spotted a little gap and sniped through for a fine try reminiscent of Aaron Smith against Wales the day before. Otherwise the English backs again struggled for collective fluency and midfield balance, made worse by their team\u2019s penalty count. It is still possible they can enjoy a half-decent autumn but a predictable, painting-by-numbers approach will not secure many major titles. The irony, of course, is that Smith and his old mates have been presiding over exactly that sort of makeover with the Black Ferns in recent months. If they do end up outflanking the Red Roses and a quick-witted Japan side also run Eddie Jones\u2019s men\u2019s team around at Twickenham, it will be both a bleak weekend for English rugby and an insightful one for coaches everywhere.

                    "body": "At the hastily organised live sites for the Socceroos\u2019 historic game against Argentina, Sydney turned out in full force.\nAlthough Australian fans were left bitterly disappointed at the 2-1 loss, many were also frustrated it took the city so long to clue into the huge groundswell of support enjoyed by the team at this World Cup.\n\nThroughout the early Sunday morning game, supporters never stopped arriving at the main site in Sydney, Tumbalong Park in Darling Harbour, streaming down the many walkways, waving scarves and flags.\nBut access to the site was soon restricted as the crowd ballooned, with supporters left to find space outside the official viewing area, many standing on tables or balconies to get a view.\n\nStuart Farrell was among the fans initially barred entry after the number of fans overwhelmed organisers and as police restricted access soon after the match began.\n\u201cThey seemed to have underestimated the number of people who would turn up today. You can see people were hanging off staircases or standing on benches outside the park,\u201d he said.\n\u201cThey should have expanded this viewing site. Why did they fence it off? Why isn\u2019t this bigger? And why didn\u2019t we have this the whole time? Melbourne had a viewing site from day one.\n\u201cThey just jumped on the bandwagon, but the supporters showed they were always up for it.\u201d\nAccess was restricted because the park was considered full.\nPolice surrounded the viewing site, some on horseback, guarding the entry points and preventing anyone from accessing it once the game started.\n\nJoshua Ciscato said the event felt rushed, as though authorities neither expected Australia to reach the knockout stages nor the support and demand for a live viewing site.\n\u201cThis was clearly put together quickly,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t really see why this wasn\u2019t done for the group stages. I think there was a bit of a reluctance to support Australian football.\n\u201cHow can you only have a live event when the team makes it out of the group stages? It\u2019s pretty ridiculous. We were all watching them anyways.\u201d\n\u201cThe organising of the space has been up and down,\u201d said William Lyttle, who was excited by the atmosphere but frustrated at how the event was organised.\n\u201cWe\u2019re all sort of squeezed into one area. I feel like the government kind of rushed this a little bit, considering they were looking at Federation Square in Melbourne, seeing how good it was and cobbled this together.\n\n\u201cIt feels a little underorganised. Especially at the beginning, they could have done better to prepare for the number of people that were going to attend.\u201d\nBut despite some of the frustrations, many fans said Sydney \u201cturned up\u201d for the Socceroos.\n\u201cSydney stood up today,\u201d Andoni Guevara said, proudly wearing his Socceroos jersey.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve done well. The atmosphere is amazing here and its a reflection of how popular football is. Football has always been popular here. If they had brought out the screens and parks from the first match, we all would\u2019ve turned up to that as well.\u201d\nIt was a sentiment that filtered through the crowd, a sense that Sydney was always going to turn up for an occasion like this and for football in general given the chance.\nAnd while the match itself was nerve-racking, reflected in the gnawing tension that gripped the crowd for most of the game, the ecstasy on display when Australia scored was infectious.\n\u201cIt was the greatest moment of my life,\u201d enthused Jack Martin, breathless at the very thought of it.\n\u201cDon\u2019t tell my girlfriend that, but it was absolutely brilliant. I couldn\u2019t believe it. I barely even saw the screen, just limbs and flares. It was so incredible to have a sense of hope.\u201d\n\nMuch like in Federation Square, the viewing site was characterised by orange flares, lit up as the second half went on, and tossed around between fans, many holding them and jumping to chants of \u201col\u00e9, ol\u00e9, ol\u00e9\u201d.\nThe bright orange smoke framed the screens, enveloping the crowd as they jumped and chanted, often making it feel more like an electrified stadium crowd than a park on a Sunday morning.\n\u201cThe boys are getting around this,\u201d nodded AJ Khoury. \u201cThey\u2019re enjoying it. It\u2019s bouncing. It was always worth the wake up.\n\u201cSydney turns up; we turn up to support our boys. That\u2019s what we do.\u201d"

                    "body": "Aziz Behich had fire in his eyes and a protest on his lips, remonstrating as if he hadn\u2019t just needlessly upended Papu Gomez. The referee was hearing none of it \u2013 emotion gets you nowhere on this stage. The left-back had done it simply because he was pissed off, rankled by a shoulder charge from Lionel Messi that was every bit as legitimate as his subsequent move was not.\nWorld Cup matches are decided by moments. By the angled head of Mitchell Duke and the cut inside of Mat Leckie. By a free-kick for Messi near the corner flag. And it had to be him. History will show tonight was all about Messi. About his 1,000th match and his first goal in the knockout stages of a World Cup. If Argentina go on to win the thing, Australia will be nothing more than a step in the right direction.\n\nIn that sense, there are worse ways for the Socceroos to go than to be a part of a bigger positive story than their own big positive story. They could have been knocked out by, say, a dive in the box from Fabio Grosso, or an underwhelming group-stage showing in which they scored no goals from open play. Qatar 2022 was not Australia\u2019s tournament, but it was also very much Australia\u2019s tournament. It was the tournament of dancing in Federation Square and pop-up live sites around the country, of politicians with open ears and maybe now even open wallets, and of once again waking up at stupid hours for a reason other than to engage in self-flagellation under the guise of supporting your national team.\nThe Socceroos \u2013 including an otherwise-excellent Behich \u2013 will return home as heroes. Their coach, overseeing the final game of his contract, may have just bought himself another \u2013 if he wants it. After the opening goal, Graham Arnold\u2019s hands followed Messi\u2019s to the sky but for a very different reason, the sign of a heart and soul, poured into this project for four and a half years, on a comedown from the heavenly place he has inhabited for the past 10 days.\n\u201cI just hope that everyone back in Australia really respects what we\u2019ve done and are proud of us as well,\u201d Arnold said afterwards. \u201cWe took it to them. I felt that we finished off well. We had a great chance at the end there to equalise. I\u2019ve got to be very, very proud of the boys. Just so grateful at the effort they\u2019ve put in for me.\u201d\n\nOf course, the post-mortem will include some if onlys. If only Behich did not blow a gasket. If only a defender was standing in the exact spot Messi placed his finish instead of in the five spots directly surrounding the needle he threaded through them. If only, when there was still a chance of an equaliser, Mat Ryan had made that clearance the first time instead of attempting to dribble past Rodrigo De Paul.\n\nBut the overriding story is that this was not a bad Socceroos performance. Those match-deciding errors aside, it was a very good performance with all the makings of yet another upset of a much higher power. It was worthy of a team reaching the quarter-finals; the moving mass of blue-and-white tension in the stands confirmed it to be so. Australia forced the issue, yanked Messi out of his first-half dormancy, made him come alive even if to their own detriment. They were a lump in the throat of football gods for all the world to see.\n\nKeanu Baccus, who not three weeks ago had Messi in his fantasy five-a-side team, shirt-fronted his hero in the opening minutes. The St Mirren man was here to play Paris Saint-Germain. It perfectly encapsulated the lack of deference that rendered this contest far closer to equal on the field than it appeared on paper.\nThe almost comeback did that too. With almost 80 minutes gone, Craig Goodwin smashed an errant shot that took a deflection and flew into the far corner. Behich, having long rededicated himself to the cause, took off on a run for the ages, a slalom past four players which would have made for one of the great goals of this World Cup had his shot not been blocked by a stretching Lisandro Martinez. Garang Kuol almost announced himself to the world but for a brilliant intervention by Emi Martinez in injury-time.\nThen it was the end. It was Mozart\u2019s Requiem, the Socceroos pursued by death but still writing their own funeral on the edge of consciousness, willing it into existence with their final breaths. Now they are gone, but leave behind a brilliant score."

                    "body": "If Wallabies players can find a way to be as ruthless as their Rugby Australia bosses and as cunning as their new coach, exciting days lie ahead. The announcement by RA that Eddie Jones is returning as coach of the men\u2019s side, overseer of the women\u2019s program and chief of chiefs for the five years leading into the 2027 World Cup in Australia, is monumental. By showing Dave Rennie the door and throwing Jones the keys to the kingdom, RA has again turned to an Australian coach and backed his vision to return to the \u201cWallabies way\u201d: uptempo running rugby played hard but fair. They have also sent a bold warning shot to the world ahead of the World Cup in September.  Jones has a remarkable win-loss record of 82% at the four World Cups he has contested. In the first year of his initial reign as Wallabies coach in 2001 it was only a last-gasp Jonny Wilkinson field goal that stood between Jones and the game\u2019s ultimate prize. In 2007, as South Africa\u2019s key technical adviser, he won it. And in 2019, he took England to the final. Although RA hailed him on Monday as \u201cthe best coach in the world\u201d, the caveat to all that World Cup success is that Jones has never led a team to the trophy outright as head coach. How sweet it would be to do so in 2023, some 18 years after first the first job as Wallabies coach and less than 12 months after being unceremoniously sacked by England. When the RFU pulled the trigger on Jones, they gifted him to Hamish McLennan. The ambitious RA chairman had already sounded out Jones on a return as director of rugby if his seven years at England came to an end. And when Rennie\u2019s Wallabies won just five of 14 Tests in 2022 \u2013 blowing victories against New Zealand, France and Ireland, and crumbling to humiliating losses against Argentina and Italy \u2013 the chase for Jones hit warp speed. When Jones last week told the Guardian, \u201cI\u2019m not an assistant coach, mate\u201d, Rennie smelled his blood in the water but dug in. \u201cWe\u2019ve had no discussions around that,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cThere\u2019s no plan to make alterations \u2026 My assumption is we\u2019re going to push on.\u201d Yet this month Rennie was forced to deny he\u2019d been approached to coach Kobe in Japan.  As Jones and McLennan hammered out a five-year deal, Rennie spent December doing player reviews and World Cup planning. Last week he took a 44-man squad into camp for the last time. On Monday morning, the players reconvened on Zoom where RA\u2019s CEO, Andy Marinos, told them Rennie was fading to black and Jones was back in the golden circle. Although Australia\u2019s players loved Rennie and his gentle quest to unearth their mana (the power of the elemental forces of nature embodied within them), Jones\u2019s appointment will excite them. He will tap into their mongrel selves and unleash the team\u2019s missing X factor: the confidence to play fearless, inspiring rugby and the calculation to close out tight games. Under Jones, a renowned taskmaster, the hardest workers and heaviest hitters will prosper. Cross-code raids on junior and senior NRL ranks will recommence and deadwood will be jettisoned (Jones churned through 112 players and 80 coaching staff at England).  It\u2019s bad news for overpaid loafers like Taniela Tupou and dormant dynamo Suliasi Vunivalu, but good news for the 2019 Junior Wallabies who will form the core of the 2027 World Cup charge \u2013 Angus Bell, Noah Lolesio and Mark Nawaqanitawase (all 22), Fraser McReight, Nick Frost and Ben Donaldson (23). Jones starts sorting diamonds from the coal on 29 January. Beyond players, RA has given Jones scope to upgrade Australia\u2019s programs and pathways. The Wallaroos, still amateurs unlike their English and New Zealand rivals, will go pro under Jones\u2019s reign and build on the work of their gold-winning sevens team to challenge the Matildas and Diamonds as Australia\u2019s first women of sport in time for their own World Cup in 2027. But there is risk in Jones as boss too. He is 62 and closer to the end than the beginning. Although he boasted a 73% career record (the greatest of all England\u2019s coaches) he had a 5-6 win-loss record in 2022 (Rennie\u2019s 38% win rate was the Wallabies\u2019 worst in 30 years). Depending on the source, Jones is also a maverick, a megalomaniac and a madman. But he is Australia\u2019s madman now. And after 24 years without a World Cup and too many seasons of underperformance, Wallabies fans are, as another Australian madman once said, \u201cmad as hell and not going to take it any more\u201d. Eight months out from rugby\u2019s greatest prize and at long odds of winning it, RA has rolled the dice. Things just got interesting. \u2022 This article was amended on 18 January 2023 to remove some incorrect details about Eddie Jones\u2019 role in the early career of the former Wallaby George Smith."

Jewellery and watches were among the items stolen and the break-in is being investigated by Surrey police.\n\nSterling has prioritised his family\u2019s wellbeing and England, who were boosted by Declan Rice returning to training on Thursday after illness, did not put pressure on him on whether to return to the team\u2019s Al Wakrah base. But the 28-year-old\u2019s decision to leave the UK is good news for Gareth Southgate.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a massive lift,\u201d Phillips said. \u201cRaheem\u2019s an amazing player. We\u2019re just happy that everything\u2019s all right and he can play a big part in the next game.\n\u201cRaheem feels good enough to join back up with us and we\u2019re very happy that his family are OK.\u201d\nPhillips said the incident had left the rest of England\u2019s players worrying about security at their homes. \u201cOnce one player goes through it there is always that thought in the back of your mind that it might happen to you or it could happen to somebody else,\u201d the midfielder said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a really nice feeling when you are so far from home and you have family at home. There\u2019s not really much we can do about it.\u201d\nSouthgate will need to assess whether Sterling is ready to be part of the matchday squad for the game against France. Sterling, who has scored 20 goals in 81 caps, has been unable to take part in any preparations and has been through a difficult ordeal.\nEqually, Southgate needs every attacking tool at his disposal and will want strength in depth on the bench. Sterling had lost his place in England\u2019s starting lineup before flying home, but he is one of the most experienced players in the squad and played a vital role in England reaching the final of Euro 2020.\nBukayo Saka and Phil Foden are favourites to start on the flanks against France, with Harry Kane certain to lead the line. Southgate also has Marcus Rashford, Jack Grealish, Mason Mount and James Maddison as options in wide areas."

                    "body": "Liverpool face Leicester on Friday evening looking to win a fourth Premier League game in succession and strengthen their push for a top-four place. For one of their players the encounter also provides an opportunity for redemption, the chance to right a wrong from almost exactly a year ago and further demonstrate that after a difficult 12 months he is back to his very best. Indeed, Mohamed Salah may well look back at events at the King Power Stadium on Tuesday, 28 December 2021 as when things turned against him. He went into the game against Leicester in sensational form having scored 22 goals in 24 appearances for a rampant Liverpool side. He, and they, appeared set for more joy on a chilly night in the east Midlands, especially given the hosts were in poor form and severely hampered by injuries, and everything appeared to be going to plan when on 15 minutes the visitors were awarded a penalty after a foul by Wilfred Ndidi on Salah. He took it himself, and then came the twist \u2013 the shot was saved by Kasper Schmeichel, with the Egyptian\u2019s header from the subsequent rebound crashing against the bar.  Liverpool never recovered and went on to lose 1-0 after Ademola Lookman\u2019s smartly taken goal on 59 minutes. It appeared a sizeable blow to their title hopes but, come the new year, J\u00fcrgen Klopp\u2019s men were able to demonstrate the character and quality required to remain on Manchester City\u2019s heels until the final stages of the final day, as well as winning two trophies and just missing out on Champions League glory. Salah played a part in that but his personal journey was altogether more rocky. With Egypt he lost the Africa Cup of Nations final and failed to qualify for the World Cup, while generally his eye for goal became blurry. He was still finding the back of the net but far less often and the 30-year-old may still be reflecting on what he could have achieved in 2022, for club and country, had he maintained his 2021 levels. To a large extent that was impossible \u2013 such was Salah\u2019s form in the early stages of last season, especially, that he was legitimately being hailed as the best player on the planet. It is difficult for any modern footballer not named Messi or Ronaldo to reside in such rarefied air, but given his confidence and class Salah will have believed he could have done so and, ultimately, avoided an annus horribilis post his King Power calamity. As he prepares to take on Leicester again it will, then, be a source of satisfaction for the forward that he is currently performing so well.  Salah has featured in each of Liverpool\u2019s fixtures since the resumption of club football: the 3-2 defeat to Manchester City in the Carabao Cup and the 3-1 league victory over Aston Villa on Boxing Day, scoring in both games and, in the latter in particular, looking his typical self. There was the ice-cold finish to give Liverpool the lead on five minutes, the composed assist that led to Virgil van Dijk making it 2-0 and an overall display of high intensity and quality, from a defensive as well as attacking point of view, seen in the fact that as well as having the second-highest XG of any player at Villa Park (0.84) and creating the joint-highest number of chances (four), he also made six recoveries and won a couple of duels. A six-week break as others did battle in Qatar has clearly been good for Salah but it should be noted that he was catching the eye and contributing in the weeks prior to the World Cup, too, benefiting from a reconfiguration of Liverpool\u2019s forward line in which he played closer to goal having essentially been deployed as a winger at the start of the season as Klopp went about integrating Darwin N\u00fa\u00f1ez into the team after the striker\u2019s \u00a385m arrival from Benfica. It didn\u2019t work, despite Salah and N\u00fa\u00f1ez forming an immediate rapport, and through circumstance and choice, underpinned by a need by Klopp to improve Liverpool\u2019s results, Salah returned more predominantly to a position between left centre-back and left-back, ready to drive across and between them and do what he does best \u2013 cause panic, create danger and, most of all, score goals. He now has 16 in all competitions this campaign (along with six assists), with the one he got against Villa his 172nd for Liverpool since joining from Roma in 2017, putting him seventh in the club\u2019s list of all-time goalscorers, alongside Kenny Dalglish. It is a stunning achievement and given Salah\u2019s age, consistency, fitness record and the contract extension he signed in the summer, he is not only certain to surpass \u201cthe King\u201d in Liverpool\u2019s record books but also, more than likely, Robbie Fowler, Steven Gerrard and Billy Liddell. Though Ian Rush, Roger Hunt and Gordon Hodgson may be out of reach. Like all of them he is, undeniably, an Anfield legend. The legacy is secure but it is Salah\u2019s relentless pursuit of excellence that makes him the player he is and, given his form and revitalised levels of energy and urgency, he appears primed to strive for more. And next in Salah\u2019s sights are Leicester, a ghost of Christmas past he will no doubt be determined to vanquish prior to a prosperous new year."

                    "body": "There are no winners in revenge missions. Sentiment demanded that Ghana should right the wrongs of their 2010 World Cup quarter-final against Uruguay and expiate the hurt of Luis Su\u00e1rez\u2019s last-minute handball on the line. But Uruguay, and Su\u00e1rez in particular, have no time for such romantic notions of redemption. Ghana were again eliminated after missing a penalty but they had the consolation that, although Su\u00e1rez set up two, it was South Korea and not Uruguay who went through to the last 16 with Portugal.\nUruguay did not react well. As Ghanaians sat in resigned weariness on the pitch, Uruguay\u2019s players surrounded the idiosyncratic German referee, Daniel Siebert, at the final whistle, furious they hadn\u2019t been awarded at least one of two huge penalty appeals in the second half. The Ghanaian fans, resigned by then to their exit, seemed to enjoy it all immensely. And as Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Gim\u00e9nez raged at Siebert, Su\u00e1rez wept on the bench.\n\nThis was a game haunted by the memory of events at Soccer City 12 years ago, and specifically by that one moment in the final minute of extra-time. The image was always there, a perverse footballing piet\u00e0, flitting in the peripheral vision: Stephen Appiah in the foreground having had the initial blocked effort (which was probably offside, although nobody talks about that), John Mensah and the goalkeeper Fernando Muslera falling together with Andr\u00e9s Scotti, Dominic Adiyiah stretching having headed the loose ball goalwards, Jorge Fucile with back arched and left fist thrust up having missed his attempt to handle, and Su\u00e1rez, arms out, leaping to his right to claw the ball away. It is the Pisgah of African football, the moment when it saw the promised land of a World Cup semi-final, but was denied.\n\nBillboards across Accra this week have depicted the incident with the slogan: \u201cREVENGE!: Let\u2019s support the Black Stars.\u201d The fact that Ghanaians still feel the pain of that moment was made clear by the pre-match press conference. Su\u00e1rez, with a characteristic sense of provocative showmanship, appeared alone and seemed entirely unfazed by a Ghanaian journalist saying that many in his country saw him as \u201cthe devil himself\u201d (adding \u201cel diablo\u201d, lest there be any confusion) and wanted to \u201cretire\u201d him. He didn\u2019t regret it, he said. He had been punished. He had been shown a red card and missed the semi-final as a result. It wasn\u2019t his fault Asamoah Gyan had missed the penalty.\nWas this an elaborate wind-up? Su\u00e1rez had played just 81 minutes in the group stage and had been distinctly unimpressive, managing just one shot on goal (off target). But if this was one enormous mind game Uruguay carried it to the extreme, naming Su\u00e1rez as captain. Was that in the mind of Andr\u00e9 Ayew, the only Ghana player at Al Janoub to have appeared in the 2010 quarter-final, as he stepped up to take a penalty?\nFor, of course there was penalty controversy, lots of it. How could there not be? Sergio Rochet, the Uruguay keeper, clearly tripped Mohammed Kudus but initially Andr\u00e9 Ayew was ruled offside. When VAR proved he had been played fractionally onside by the heel of Math\u00edas Olivera, the penalty award was automatic. His kick, though, was dismal and easily saved.\n\nThen, just before the hour, Darwin N\u00fa\u00f1ez went down under a challenge from Daniel Amartey. Siebert didn\u2019t give it, was told to consult the screen and, unusually, decided not to overturn the decision, signalling he had seen a slight touch on the ball. It was a decision that proved vital for Uruguay\u2019s goal difference; had that been given and converted, they would have gone through. Edinson Cavani had another decent shout in stoppage time by which point news had come through that South Korea had beaten Portugal and the game had become a frenetic slug-fest, all shape gone, just one attack after another.\nFor Ghana, who held a two-point advantage at kick-off, the moment had been there, but the moment was missed. There was a sense of inevitability to what followed. Few sides are as good as Uruguay at sensing a game\u2019s emotional pulse. As Ghana reeled, Uruguay surged. Mohammed Salisu had already cleared off the line from N\u00fa\u00f1ez when Su\u00e1rez\u2019s shot was half-blocked by Lawrence Ati-Zigi. The ball was probably spinning in anyway but Giorgian de Arrascaeta nodded over the line from close range.\n\nSix minutes later, he had his second, volleying crisply home after a clever Su\u00e1rez flick. He may be 35, the belly starting to show beneath the shirt but, though much is taken, much abides: there is magic yet in his brain and his touch, and perhaps particularly when opposition fans get the blood going.\nAnd the fury, so strangely lacking against South Korea, was back. He raged at the officials, needled away at Salisu and put his body in the way to win free-kicks before being withdrawn after 65 minutes. He had beaten them again.\nThe devil, perhaps, is never truly done but, this time, it was not quite enough. A shot of him sobbing on the big screen drew delighted jeers. Ghana had gone out \u2013 but at least they had taken the devil with them."

                    "body": "Low-wage migrant workers have been forced to pay billions of dollars in recruitment fees to secure their jobs in World Cup host nation Qatar over the past decade, a Guardian investigation has found. Bangladeshi men migrating to Qatar are likely to have paid about $1.5bn (\u00a31.14bn) in fees, and possibly as high as $2bn, between 2011 and 2020. Nepali men are estimated to have paid around $320m, and possibly more than $400m, in the four years between mid-2015 to mid-2019. The total cost incurred by Qatar\u2019s low-wage migrant workforce is likely to be far higher because workers from other labour-sending countries in south Asia and Africa also pay high fees. Migrants from Bangladesh and Nepal, who make up around a third of Qatar\u2019s 2-million strong foreign workforce, typically pay fees of $3,000 to $4,000 and $1,000 to $1,500 respectively. This means that many low-wage workers from Bangladesh \u2013 who can earn as little as $275 a month \u2013 have to work for at least a year just to pay off their recruitment fees. With just months to go until the World Cup kicks off, the findings reveal the scale of exploitation endured by some of the world\u2019s poorest workers, including many who have been employed on World Cup-related construction and hospitality projects. The figures, which have been calculated by the Guardian and corroborated by a number of labour rights groups, are an estimate based on the prevalence and cost of recruitment fees and related expenses reported by numerous human rights groups and labour experts between 2014 and 2022. The charging of recruitment fees is illegal in Qatar and \u2013 beyond a maximum limit \u2013 in Nepal and Bangladesh, but the practice is widespread and deeply entrenched. It is commonplace in all the Gulf countries. The figures calculated by the Guardian include all fees, including those within the maximum limit. It takes different forms, but often sees companies or brokers in Qatar and recruitment agents in labour-sending countries colluding to force workers into paying for their own recruitment. The fees are paid to agents in workers\u2019 home countries before departure. Workers often have to take out high-interest loans or sell land to afford the fees, leaving them vulnerable to debt bondage \u2013 a form of modern slavery \u2013 as they are unable to leave their jobs until the debt has been repaid. Despite the costs, hundreds of thousands of Bangladeshi and Nepali workers continue to seek work in the Gulf and beyond each year, largely due to a lack of jobs and low wages at home. Many pay the fees knowing the risks but calculating that it will pay off in the long term. Their dilemma was plain to see in the departure hall at Kathmandu\u2019s international airport, where workers made hurried video calls to their families, thick red \u201ctikka\u201d smeared on their foreheads; a symbol of good wishes from friends. \u201cI\u2019m feeling really worried,\u201d said one worker, going abroad for the first time. \u201cBut I have to go. I have money problems.\u201d Another, taking up a construction job in Qatar, waved goodbye to his baby son on his phone. \u201cI\u2019m so sad to be leaving my children,\u201d he said. \u201cI paid 150,000 [Nepali] rupees [NPR] [$1,230]. The agent told me, \u2018If you want to go, you have to pay\u2019.\u201d The Qatari authorities say they have taken steps to address the problem by opening recruitment centres in eight countries, starting in 2018, where workers must go to complete various administrative tasks and sign their contracts before departure. While the centres may have reduced the incidence of \u201ccontract substitution\u201d \u2013 where workers find different terms and conditions in Qatar to what they were promised at home \u2013 experts said they have done little to curb recruitment fees, because these are paid much earlier in the recruitment process. A 2021 report on recruitment between Nepal and Qatar led by migrant rights group FairSquare said Qatar has \u201clargely seen recruitment and fee payment as an origin state concern, and recruiters have generally been subject to relatively limited regulation\u201d. However, the local organising committee of the World Cup introduced a scheme in 2018 to ensure companies with stadium contracts repay the recruitment fees of their workers, as well as some workers on other projects. Workers are not required to show proof that they have paid fees, which is almost impossible to do given that the practice is illegal. Companies have pledged to repay roughly $28.5m to about 49,000 workers. So far around $22m has been reimbursed. The number of workers who will benefit, however, is only a tiny fraction of the total in Qatar. In many cases, the repayments only cover part of the recruitment fees, and do not provide any additional compensation or account for the cost of the workers\u2019 loans.  The Guardian understands the scheme has also not been extended to thousands of workers in the hospitality sector who are playing a direct role in the World Cup. Last year, the Guardian interviewed workers in Fifa-endorsed hotels who said they had paid recruitment fees of up to $2,750. The supreme committee organising the World Cup said in a statement, \u201cWe remain committed to delivering the legacy we promised. A legacy that improves lives and lays the foundation for fair, sustainable, and lasting labour reforms.\u201d Narad Nath Bharadwaj, a former Nepal ambassador to Qatar, called the practice a \u201cgruesome story\u201d, saying more than 90% of workers pay fees. \u201cPayment is illegal and mostly takes place under the table, so the workers have no proof they have paid. But they are unable to get a job if they do not pay 150,000 or 200,000 NPR. For better jobs the rate is higher,\u201d he said. While some workers are recruited for free or minimal cost, the vast majority are forced to pay; often victims of deals between employers and agents in Qatar and a chain of recruiters and brokers in Nepal and Bangladesh. In some cases, employers or agents in Qatar secure visas to recruit workers and then demand kickbacks of about $300 to $500 for each worker from agents in labour-sending countries in exchange for the visas, the cost of which is passed on to workers. A report for the Qatar Foundation said: \u201cThe costs borne by workers \u2026 are essentially \u2018bribes\u2019 demanded (extorted) by recruitment agents to secure the jobs in Qatar for which they enter into debt with high-interest rates.\u201d Bangladeshi workers, like Aman Ullah, pay by far the highest fees. In 2016, Ullah was charged 360,000 taka ($4,190) for a job in Qatar. He was promised work as a welder on a monthly wage of 2,500 Qatari rial ($686), but on arrival, he was taken out to the desert to work on a farm for 800 rial. \u201cThere was no limit to the work,\u201d he said. \u201cWe had no electricity or air-conditioning and were not allowed to leave the compound.\u201d His employer would not let him return home until he begged for permission to visit his sick mother. Back in Bangladesh, with nothing to show for his time in Qatar, his debt had ballooned to 800,000 taka forcing him to take out further loans to pay off the original debt. Even in death, workers are not released from their recruitment debt. Hoping to earn money for his daughter\u2019s dowry, Mahamad Nadaf Mansur Dhuniya, from Nepal, paid an agent 150,000 NPR for a construction job in Qatar in 2018. He could only afford the fee by taking out a loan with an annual interest rate of 48%. Last year, he was found hanging in his workplace.  His wife, Mairul Khatun, is unsure why he killed himself. \u201cI think it may have been the pressure of the loan, his daughter\u2019s marriage, the need to look after his family,\u201d she said, from her home in southern Nepal. Her hands and feet are smeared in mud from labouring in the nearby fields, for which she earns 300 NPR a day and a few potatoes, which lie on the ground beside her. She may have lost her husband, but his debt remains. \u201cI have a lot of tension now. Before, we sometimes ate meat and milk but we\u2019ve stopped now. How can we afford these things?\u201d Khatun said. \u201cI can\u2019t sleep at night.\u201d The Qatar government said companies involved in illegal recruitment practices have been severely punished. Twenty four recruitment agencies were recently shut down and had their licences revoked for breaking Qatar\u2019s laws. A spokesperson said: \u201cThere are complex challenges that need to be overcome to protect economic migrants globally, including in Europe. For its part, Qatar is committed to eradicating illegal recruitment practices in its labour market and supporting efforts to tackle abuse and exploitation throughout the global economy.\u201d Dr Ahmed Munirus Saleheen of Bangladesh\u2019s ministry of expatriates\u2019 welfare and overseas employment said: \u201cThe government of Bangladesh is strongly committed to ensuring safe, orderly, regular and responsible work migration.\u201d He blamed \u201cvisa trading\u201d by middlemen in both the country of origin and destination for the high cost of recruitment and said legal action was immediately taken against recruitment agencies when complaints of unfair recruitment practices were received. The Nepal government did not respond to repeated requests for comment. \u2022 In the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or email jo@samaritans.org or jo@samaritans.ie.

The Liverpool and England midfielder, who was involved in both games, has dreadful stories to tell about the experiences of his family at each. He says his father, Brian, decided after Paris that he would not travel again, meaning he would not follow England to the World Cup finals in Qatar. Henderson has other family members who have been similarly put off.  The Champions League final in May was marred by organisational chaos and dangerous scenes before, during and afterwards. Thousands of supporters missed kick-off, which was delayed by 36 minutes because of congestion outside the Stade de France where Liverpool fans had been corralled into a bottleneck. The police used teargas indiscriminately and local youths attacked and robbed supporters. \u201cIt was pretty horrific,\u201d Henderson said. \u201cWhen I spoke to some of my friends and my family and my dad, it was pretty bad. If the fans weren\u2019t respectful there could have been a lot more problems. I think the fans were amazing. \u201cIt was the authorities and the people around the stadium that weren\u2019t and were causing issues. I suppose as a fan, if you\u2019re going to the game and you don\u2019t feel comfortable and you feel threatened by whatever situation, you\u2019re not going to want to go again. It\u2019s as simple as that really. \u201cMy family and friends have had a couple of experiences over the last couple of years which have really shocked them and probably put them off going to future games. When you see scenes like you have in the Euros final, in the Champions League final, then they don\u2019t really want to go and put themselves in that situation again.  \u201cI don\u2019t blame anyone that doesn\u2019t want to put themselves in that situation. There were two totally different reasons [for the problems] but again, if it was me, I wouldn\u2019t want to put myself in that situation. \u201cMy dad said after the Champions League final that was him done. When it gets closer to the World Cup \u2026 there\u2019s a lot of security elements and things that are going on in Qatar that I\u2019m sure will make people more safe. But when you\u2019ve had those experiences, sometimes you think: \u2018Is it worth risking it?\u2019 We will have to see closer to the time.\u201d At the European Championship final in July last year fans fought with police and stewards and stormed the turnstiles to force entry without tickets. Alan Maguire, the father of the England defender Harry, was trampled in the stampede and suffered suspected broken ribs. Many others were injured and shaken. Henderson said: \u201cMy wife and kids have to get in through a side door [at Wembley] and they wouldn\u2019t let them in at the beginning. They were trapped. She was trying to get the kids away from the middle of what was happening and eventually, after about 15 or 20 minutes, somebody recognised her and let them in. If that person didn\u2019t, it could have been trouble.  \u201cMy dad was involved a little bit and Harry Maguire\u2019s dad was hurt badly. My kids were OK but they were lucky. I think other kids and other parents might not have been as lucky \u2026 it would have been horrendous [for them]. We all know that was a bad experience for a lot of people and then we have Paris, which is probably even worse.\u201d Henderson was asked whether the players were aware of what was happening before the games. \u201cNot to the extent of how bad they both were,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Paris one was a bit different. You come out [for the warm-up] and then it gets delayed. They just say: \u2018Delays getting fans in.\u2019 And you don\u2019t really know why. \u201cThen you go out again [to warm up] and it\u2019s still not a lot of fans [in the seats] and you start questioning what is actually going on. At the same time you are trying to prepare for one of the biggest games of your life. It was the same for both sides.\u201d"

                    "body": "There were only 22 minutes on the clock when James Maddison limped off, giving Gareth Southgate an injury scare before England head off for the World Cup, but by that stage the Leicester playmaker had already done his bit to loosen David Moyes\u2019s grip on the West Ham job.  Maddison\u2019s seventh goal of the season arrived early, handing Leicester the impetus to edge further into mid-table, and made it impossible not to wonder if West Ham\u2019s players are still listening to their manager. That lingering sense of the Moyes project growing stale is gathering momentum. Far too many flaws were evident during another lacklustre display from West Ham, whose habit of starting games slowly has left them a point above the bottom three, and while the break for Qatar gives Moyes breathing space there will be people wondering if he should still be in charge when the season resumes next month. For now there is no sign of West Ham\u2019s owners wanting to make a change. Yet Moyes spent a lot last summer and is struggling to find a winning formula. At the moment he is presiding over a misshapen team; one with an unfocused defence, a predictable attack and, in Declan Rice, a midfield general who can be forgiven for thinking about seeking a fresh challenge next summer. \u201cPeople are right,\u201d Moyes said of the boos at full-time. \u201cThey\u2019re more used to being sixth or seventh in the league.\u201d The Scot considered whether he deserves more time. \u201cI\u2019m really grateful for our club and the support they have given me,\u201d he added. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve done bad for them either.\u201d  A fair point, yet the magic that carried West Ham to a Europa League semi-final last season has disappeared. Under pressure after two successive league defeats and the humiliation of exiting the Carabao Cup against Blackburn, Moyes needed urgency. What he got was another exhibition of his side\u2019s inability to attack from the off. Leicester\u2019s opener was sparked by Boubakary Soumar\u00e9 stepping through midfield and sending Harvey Barnes clear on the left. The winger evaded Thilo Kehrer and West Ham were in trouble when Lucas Paquet\u00e1 failed to track Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall. From there it was on to Patson Daka and the striker\u2019s scuffed shot ran to Maddison, who celebrated his surprise inclusion in the England squad by ramming an emphatic finish past Lukasz Fabianski. The question was whether Moyes had gambled by starting Kurt Zouma after the defender hobbled off with a knee problem during the warm-up. West Ham\u2019s defence was disorganised and Zouma only lasted 13 minutes before making way for Nayef Aguerd.  Local frustration grew, although the mood changed when Maddison clutched his right knee. Rice checked on his England colleague, who is optimistic the knock will not end his World Cup dream, but West Ham took heart from Maddison\u2019s departure. Greater intensity led to a few openings, Sa\u00efd Benrahma and Paquet\u00e1 going close. Yet West Ham failed to make chances for Gianluca Scamacca, who is goalless in his last nine games. Luke Thomas kept Jarrod Bowen quiet and Leicester should have pulled clear when Craig Dawson conceded a penalty with a lumbering foul on Daka. Fabianski\u2019s save from Youri Tielemans gave West Ham hope. With Wout Faes shackling Scamacca, though, Leicester cruised to their fifth win in eight games. They have benefited from backing Brendan Rodgers after making a poor start to the season. \u201cThe club have never, ever wavered,\u201d Rodgers said. \u201cSometimes when a manager is under pressure, normally that is when betrayal kicks in. You feel it as a manager. But that was never the case at Leicester.\u201d Leicester were dangerous on the break. Jamie Vardy threatened after coming off the bench and the game was over when another substitute, Ayoze P\u00e9rez, danced through midfield before releasing Barnes, whose confident finish left Moyes staring into the middle distance. Even Rice had allowed his head to drop."

                    "body": "By his own admission, Jack Grealish has packed a lot of \u201cstupid stuff\u201d into his 27 years. The Miguel Almir\u00f3n episode was surely a good example. Grealish was a little drunk and extremely euphoric (or perhaps it was the other way around) as he celebrated Manchester City\u2019s Premier League title triumph last season and he was asked by his teammate Bernardo Silva to explain the final-day comeback win over Aston Villa.\nGrealish being Grealish, he got carried away with one of his jokes and ended up performing a drive-by on Almir\u00f3n, the Newcastle winger. One of the secrets, Grealish said on a video shared on social media, was to substitute Riyad Mahrez because \u201che played like Almir\u00f3n\u201d. \u201cDo you know what?\u201d Grealish says from England\u2019s World Cup training base in Al Wakrah. \u201cI haven\u2019t actually been asked about that and let me just address it.\u201d\nAnd so Grealish does. He makes the point that he had been drinking but, really, there was no excuse. He regrets it and he is sorry. Grealish says that he reached out to the Newcastle defender Matt Targett, with whom he played at Villa, to ask whether he could pass on an apology to Almir\u00f3n. \u201cMatt just said: \u2018Jack, he\u2019s a lovely kid, he\u2019s harmless and he doesn\u2019t speak a lot of English \u2026 he won\u2019t really be bothered,\u2019\u201d Grealish says. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to reply [to Almir\u00f3n] on social media because you dig a bigger hole and I\u2019ve been there with other stuff.\u201d\n\nGrealish would reflect even harder when Almir\u00f3n gave an interview after he was named as the Premier League\u2019s player of the month for October. Almir\u00f3n, who scored six goals during the period \u2013 he has eight for the season \u2013 said that Grealish\u2019s comment had nothing to do with his stellar form. \u201cJack\u2019s a great player first and foremost and I wish him all the best as I always do,\u201d Almir\u00f3n said.\n\u201cI thought: \u2018What a guy,\u2019\u201d Grealish says. \u201cBecause if that was me and somebody had said that about me, I\u2019d have probably been the other way and been like: \u2018Fuck it.\u2019 I didn\u2019t realise it was a video to go out but even in private I shouldn\u2019t have said it because he\u2019s a fellow professional. I\u2019ve had a lot of stick off the Newcastle fans and rightly so.\n\u201cI like to enjoy myself and I just go with the flow but I do some stupid stuff sometimes that I do regret. When I next play against him, I\u2019ll show him the most respect because that\u2019s what he\u2019s done in a situation where he probably didn\u2019t have to. I genuinely hope he does keep scoring \u2013 as long as those Newcastle fans stop messaging me.\u201d\nGrealish is asked whether he has put Almir\u00f3n in his Fantasy Football team. \u201cNah, I don\u2019t play that,\u201d he replies. \u201cEveryone loves it. I get about 100 messages every week saying: \u2018Is [Erling] Haaland starting?\u2019 It\u2019s not really for me. I love my football but I can\u2019t be arsed with it.\u201d\n\nGrealish is nothing if not open and honest. And if he veers off course, at times, his heart is in the right place. When he scored in England\u2019s 6-2 win over Iran in the opening round of group games, he performed a wavy-armed celebration in tribute to a young City fan he had met called Finlay, who has cerebral palsy. Grealish\u2019s sister, Mollie, also has the condition.\n\u201cI don\u2019t do that for any clout or whatever,\u201d Grealish says. \u201cI do that because that\u2019s what I feel I\u2019m good at sometimes. Because I can relate to it with my little sister. It\u2019s nice for him [Finlay] because he\u2019ll go back to school and probably be quite popular. It ended up being so nice and quite emotional.\u201d\nIt is hard not to warm to Grealish as he holds court, keeping the tone light, at one point despairing at the union flag waistcoat that his dad, Kevin, has insisted on wearing to matches. Grealish is in Qatar to enjoy himself, to be himself, because that is the only way he knows and it is the key to who he is on the pitch \u2013 a player who wants to express himself without fear.\nGrealish\u2019s numbers have not been great since his \u00a3100m move from Villa to City in the summer of last year \u2013 seven goals, four assists in all competitions \u2013 and there is exasperation when he considers how such metrics are \u201call that people go on about now \u2026 so much more than they should.\u201d\nWhat Grealish wants people to recognise is courage on the ball and he brings up Silva, who he describes as probably the best player he has played with. Grealish jumps out of his seat to illustrate a moment from a City game in which Pep Guardiola ordered Silva to take the ball off the toes of the goalkeeper, Ederson, to build a move practically from the goalline.\n\n\u201cBernardo goes off on his little dribble around and I was like: \u2018What does he think he\u2019s doing? He thinks it\u2019s school football!\u2019\u201d Grealish says. \u201cHe is unbelievable. He doesn\u2019t get loads of goals and assists. But the way he takes the ball under pressure \u2026\n\u201cPep says he wants us to show balls, wanting the ball under pressure when the opposition crowd are against you \u2013 when you\u2019re at Anfield, everyone is whistling and you\u2019re saying: \u2018Give me the ball.\u2019 That is Bernardo in a nutshell. That\u2019s what I think I do a little bit.\u201d\nGrealish\u2019s love of the game and the way that he cherishes the ball always shines through. It was stamped all over a recent video of him and his City and England teammate Phil Foden playing a game of long-distance no-bounce, their touches and volleys sumptuous.\n\u201cLuke Shaw said to me: \u2018When I come away with England, you can tell who the City lads are,\u2019\u201d Grealish says. \u201cHe said: \u2018You always have a ball, you always want a ball.\u2019 We get that from being at City. At Villa, you\u2019d be sitting there, [players] on their phones \u2026 then at City, you\u2019re sitting there and balls are flying across the changing room, people playing two-touch.\u201d\nGrealish has made an impact off the bench in each of England\u2019s three games so far. With Senegal looming in the last 16 on Sunday, he intends to embrace any opportunity."

                    "body": "We may have got a glimpse of Gareth Southgate\u2019s tactics for the knockout stages in the win over Wales on Tuesday. The England head coach changed the central midfield three, removing the attacking role behind Harry Kane to bring in the experienced Jordan Henderson in a deeper position.\nEngland will have seen what other teams are doing and how they operate, leaving Southgate to create a plan that could take England through to the final. Brazil, for example, go through the middle of teams and an extra man in central midfield will help counteract that. It worked against Wales, who managed a solitary shot.\nEngland\u2019s first \u2013 but hopefully not last \u2013 opponents in the knockout stages are Senegal, who have serious midfield concerns. Cheikhou Kouyat\u00e9 was injured in the first match and Idrissa Gueye picked up a second booking against Ecuador, meaning he will be suspended. Having to reshuffle for a vital game will be a tough ask for them.\n\nMidfield is an area where England are strong. Jude Bellingham has arguably been their best player across the opening three games and Declan Rice has worked diligently. Having a third deeper central player is not necessarily a defensive move because Bellingham has proved he is a threat going forward and Rice and Henderson allow him greater freedom to attack in the space previously occupied by Mason Mount. Adding Henderson in place of a more attacking midfielder brings a level of robustness that should allow England to cope with technical and physical opponents.\nKyle Walker can help protect the areas in front of the defence from right-back \u2013 it is something he does a lot at Manchester City \u2013 but he has played only an hour in the tournament, so the balance of three deeper central midfielders makes sense. Kalvin Phillips could drop into the central three and his time against Wales will be useful.\n\nAnother change was the use of Phil Foden and Marcus Rashford from the start. In the first half they played as inverted wingers \u2013 Foden on the right and Rashford the left. The Manchester United forward was one of England\u2019s more impressive players but Foden struggled to get into the game. Wales did well to double up on the Manchester City midfielder and when he cut inside it was into a congested area.\nSouthgate swapped the two over for the second half, making an immediate impact thanks to Foden\u2019s clever dribbling to earn a free-kick from which Rashford scored. They looked more comfortable on their stronger sides. Rashford became more direct and Foden seemed liberated. The greater freedom helped him make a trademark, Pep Guardiola-inspired run to the back post to tap home the second.\nThe third goal came from Rashford, a sign of his returning confidence, when he cut inside and showed smart feet before finishing. No one should doubt his ability. When young players come on to the scene they are quite raw and just go for it, but the next stage, when they are about 21 and people imagine they have 50 caps and are more experienced than they are, is really hard. They have to get through that. Rashford has come out the other side and is showing what he is capable of. It is a case of believing in yourself and he has the self-confidence required at the top, allowing United and England to reap the rewards this season.\nIt will be difficult for Southgate to leave out Foden or Rashford. The only question is whether Foden can get in the game enough to affect it. I liked what he brought, trying to take people on, being brave and attempting to open up the opposition. The performance should help him to stay in the team.\n\nBefore the tournament the only concern I had about England was the defence. In three games they have conceded twice, which is largely down to how well they have controlled the matches. England have kept the ball well and that makes a team more defensively sound because the opposition cannot threaten without possession.\nEngland have not lost in their 20 matches against African opposition, which is an impressive record. There have already been shocks in the tournament and the important thing is for England to maintain their focus. Kalidou Koulibaly scored Senegal\u2019s winner after a free-kick was crossed into the box against Ecuador, a sign of how dangerous he is.\nEngland will be favourites but they should not have one eye on the quarter-final because they will be punished. I have played in tournaments where we were tipped to win, lost concentration, conceded two goals from set pieces and were on the next plane home.\nSenegal have lost some key players: not only Gueye and Kouyat\u00e9 but also Sadio Man\u00e9 before the World Cup began. Selfishly, as an England fan, this is good news because they will be very hard to replace. Senegal do, though, have plenty of quality. We have seen at Watford how dangerous Isma\u00efla Sarr is and he proved that by winning and scoring a penalty against Ecuador.\nEngland have the tools to beat Senegal but now it is a case of getting the job done and nothing comes easy at a World Cup."

Jones was confirmed on Sunday night as the new Wallabies head coach, marking a stunning return to the post he left in 2005 and raising the tantalising prospect of returning to haunt his former employers in the knockout stages of the World Cup this year.  He officially takes up the role on 29 January, a little over seven weeks after he was sacked by the RFU, with Rugby Australia parachuting Jones in at the first available opportunity. Given the length of his tenure as England head coach, Jones was subject to UK employment law which states that employees are entitled to one week\u2019s notice per year served. In other words, after a seven-week notice period for his seven years in the job, Jones will be free to take the reins of the Wallabies. He takes with him a wealth of intellectual property and inside knowledge on England\u2019s players, which would be invaluable should he lock horns with his former side in France later this year, but the RFU chose not to insert a non-compete clause when agreeing the terms of his departure, nor seek to put Jones on gardening leave. An RFU spokesperson said: \u201cWhen the RFU ended Eddie\u2019s role as England head coach, having considered both the legal and moral perspectives, it was decided it would be unreasonable to restrict Eddie in seeking alternative employment.\u201d Meanwhile the new England head coach, Steve Borthwick, revealed he sent Jones a message of congratulations but refused to be drawn on a potential World Cup showdown, insisting his focus was on England\u2019s Six Nations opener against Scotland. \u201cI know the World Cup is around the corner but in 19 days\u2019 time we play Scotland and that\u2019s our focus,\u201d Borthwick said.  \u201cI\u2019m delighted for Eddie that he is coaching his home country. The day that I was announced as England head coach he sent me a message wishing me the very best and this morning I sent him a message wishing him the very best.\u201d"

                    "body": "Mohammed Kudus (Ghana)\nThe 22-year-old arrived in Europe as a teenager after spending his youth in the Right to Dream academy in his homeland. Nordsj\u00e6lland put him in the first team at 18, quickly proving himself too good for the Danish league in the following two seasons. Ajax spotted his talents and paid \u20ac9m to bring him to the Eredivisie. Erik ten Hag used him mainly as a central midfielder but he can play further forward and already has five goals from 18 appearances at international level. Kudus possesses great close control, can dumbfound defenders in tight spaces and can drive his team forward thanks to his dribbling. He reads the game well and even when running at speed seems to know where his teammates will be, helping him become a prolific assister for his club. WU\n\nRafael Le\u00e3o (Portugal)\nA product of the Sporting academy, the attacker has become one of the most feared forwards in Serie A, helping Milan to their first title in 11 years last season and gaining a place in the league\u2019s team of the year. In addition to height, the 23-year-old possesses plenty of pace and is often utilised on the flanks by Stefano Pioli. Le\u00e3o is as adept at creating as he is scoring, making him a threat whether out wide or down the middle. He is yet to score at international level but comes into the tournament as the joint-14th best player in the world, according to the Ballon d\u2019Or. With Cristiano Ronaldo\u2019s power waning and Diogo Jota absent, Le\u00e3o will be expected to help fill the void and show why Europe\u2019s top clubs are after him. WU\n\nGio Reyna (USA)\nHis 20th birthday comes only eight days before his team\u2019s opener, against Wales, but there is considerable World Cup weight on Reyna\u2019s shoulders. His father, Claudio, starred in the USA\u2019s run to the 2002 quarter-finals while he is named after his dad\u2019s pal, Giovanni van Bronckhorst, who made his last ever playing appearance in the 2010 final. Pressure indeed, exacerbated by being at Borussia Dortmund, Europe\u2019s prime finishing school. There have been injury frustrations; last season was shortened by muscle problems that he has worked hard to recover from but his talent is undoubted. His former teammate Erling Haaland calls him \u201cthe American dream\u201d. Among fans back home, the excitement for Reyna is higher even than that for Christian Pulisic, particularly after he recently recovered his club form and starting place. JB\nEnzo Fern\u00e1ndez (Argentina)\nMaking a late and persuasive run for inclusion in Lionel Scaloni\u2019s squad, Fern\u00e1ndez had been at River Plate since he was five years old before taking the well-worn path among young South Americans to Benfica in August. He was even named after the Uruguayan River legend \u2013 and current sporting director \u2013 Enzo Francescoli. His performances as a deep-lying central midfield playmaker \u2013 also playing box to box \u2013 in Benfica\u2019s excellent Champions League group stage showing this season are reported to have put him on the wanted lists of Barcelona and Real Madrid among others. The 21-year-old starred in Benfica\u2019s home-and-away defeats of Juventus, dominating their midfield with his ball-winning, ball-carrying and distribution. He seems destined to be a big part of his national team\u2019s post-Lionel Messi landscape. JB\nDusan Vlahovic (Serbia)\n\nThe prolific striker has already shown in Italy what he can do. His 44 goals in 98 Serie A games for Fiorentina made Juventus splash \u20ac70m upfront for his services to hopefully kickstart a new era in Turin. In addition to his impressive goal tally, Vlahovic can hold up the ball and bring others into play. He will probably start alongside Aleksandar Mitrovic, with Dusan Tadic behind, ensuring no defence that comes up against Serbia in Qatar will be allowed an easy time. Although he has impressed in domestic football, the 22-year-old is yet to show his capabilities in Europe, failing to help Juventus get out of their Champions League group, and will be keen to show the rest of the world that he truly is one of the best in the business. WU\nGavi (Spain)\nSpain\u2019s Euro 2020 breakout star was Pedri. From the same Barcelona stable comes a midfielder who only celebrated his 18th birthday in August. The latest, brightest flower from La Masia academy, in 2021 Gavi became his country\u2019s youngest ever player at 17 years and 62 days, and Spain\u2019s youngest ever scorer, against the Czech Republic this June. In October he succeeded Pedri in winning the Kopa Trophy for the world\u2019s best player under the age of 21, his skill set bringing back memories of Barcelona predecessors such as Andr\u00e9s Iniesta and Xavi, the current manager at the Camp Nou. Xavi has been as sparing as he can be with such a generational talent but Luis Enrique may not be able to resist such temptation. \u201cWe\u2019re talking about a case that\u2019s not normal,\u201d said Spain\u2019s manager. JB\n\nFederico Valverde (Uruguay)\nA key, widely unsung player in Real Madrid\u2019s 2022 Champions League-winning team, Valverde served as the lungs for older midfield colleagues such as Luka Modric, Toni Kroos and Casemiro. In Qatar, with energy levels that have had him compared to a younger Steven Gerrard, he may have to do likewise for his country\u2019s veterans such as Luis Su\u00e1rez, Diego God\u00edn and Edinson Cavani. This season he has added goals to his repertoire, including in October\u2019s 3-1 cl\u00e1sico win, making a typical surge to crash home. Signed as a teenager from Pe\u00f1arol, Valverde made his way into the Madrid first team via the Castilla reserve side but at 24, with his development and authority ever increasing, he has become a vital performer for club and country. JB\nTakefusa Kubo (Japan)\nAt 18 the winger already had Barcelona and Real Madrid on his CV, meaning his potential is undoubted. He did not make a first-team appearance for either but now has more than 100 appearances under his belt in La Liga, mainly out on loan at Mallorca, Villarreal and Getafe. Kubo finally has a permanent home in San Sebasti\u00e1n after joining Real Sociedad in the summer, scoring the winner on his debut against C\u00e1diz. He has plenty of tournament experience; Kubo went to the Under-20 World Cup aged 15, travelled to the Copa Am\u00e9rica in 2019 and scored at the Olympics two years later. More than a million people follow the 21-year-old on Instagram, an indication of his prominence and popularity in Japan, although it also shows the pressure he is under to produce on the biggest stage this winter.

                    "body": "Iliman Ndiaye wanted to perfect his skills so much they had to turn off the lights at Hyde United\u2019s Ewen Fields to make sure he got the last train home. Being sent on loan from the Premier League to the seventh tier may not seem like the most attractive proposition for a teenager but the Sheffield United forward embraced his spell in the Northern Premier League.\nNdiaye, 22, who will face England with Senegal in the World Cup on Sunday, had been playing Sunday league football in the months before Sheffield United took him on a week\u2019s trial in 2019 after he was spotted by the scout Steve Holmes. Ndiaye played in two trial matches and impressed the coaches with his fitness, aggression and skill. They offered a contract but he almost did not join because Marseille, where he had spent time in the academy as a young boy, were due compensation. Holmes and the coach Travis Binnion convinced United to pay up.\nFrom the pittance the club paid, Ndiaye is now worth millions. Nottingham Forest were keen on him in the summer before they acquired Jesse Lingard. His path to the Premier League started during his short spell with Hyde in 2020 after their then manager, David McGurk, and his assistant John McCombe spotted him playing for Sheffield United Under-23s.\n\nAt Hyde, he travelled from Sheffield for training twice a week and would amaze teammates with his dazzling footwork and ability to balance the ball on his head for a minute. Ndiaye\u2019s work ethic also stood out.\nHis father would do daily sessions with a young Ndiaye, often in the woods, where he acquired his industrious attitude. The respect of teammates was quickly earned; seeing how pivotal he was to their chances, players would go out of their way to ensure he got home safely.\n\u201cThere were games where he was so far ahead of everyone,\u201d McGurk says. \u201cIt got to the point with us where we said: \u2018Wherever you are on the pitch, give him the ball. No matter how tightly marked he is, give him the ball.\u2019 We just wanted him on the ball as much as possible. He would start on the left but we gave him the freedom to do what he wanted.\n\u201cIt can be a detriment to the squad if you are focusing on one player but the lads just appreciated it and they were happy to give him the ball. I have never seen a player that good at this level. I would turn up on a Saturday excited to watch the team as a manager because he was in it.\u201d\n\nA family visit to Senegal when the France-born Ndiaye was a one-year-old started his obsession with football. He would kick anything in sight, forcing his grandad to take action and acquire a ball for him. Since then it has barely left his feet. In France he would play in cages, learning how to deceive opponents. Scouts took notice and he was signed by Marseille.\nThe family chose to move to Senegal for a period, forcing Ndiaye to leave his Marseille dreams behind. He joined Dakar Sacr\u00e9-C\u0153ur and went from honing his skills at one of Europe\u2019s elite clubs to practising on sand pitches and at the beach, ensuring his ball control was impeccable. Ndiaye\u2019s father then found work in England, resulting in a move to London aged 14. The teenager arrived unable to speak English, so his dad sent him to football camps where he could express himself. Eight years on, Ndiaye speaks with a north London twang.\n\nHe would combine studying with playing for Boreham Wood\u2019s youth teams, eventually making it on to their first-team bench on a couple of occasions without making a National League appearance.\nTo maintain fitness, he played Sunday league games for Rising Ballers in London before being snapped up by Sheffield United.\nWhen Ndiaye arrived at Bramall Lane they thought his understanding of the game needed working on but he had a real will to learn. Hyde were a key part of that education. \u201cHe is destined for the top,\u201d McGurk says. \u201cWe told him that after one of the games.\n\u201cWe said: \u2018You\u2019ve got absolutely everything \u2013 you are not going to be playing at this level again after you go back to Sheffield United.\u2019 I am surprised by how rapidly it has happened but he has got everything to play at the top level.\u201d\nThe following season he was given his Premier League debut \u2013 at Leicester \u2013 and just over a year later he represented Senegal.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve played a very small part but you do take pride in giving the kid an opportunity with the move to Hyde,\u201d McGurk says. \u201cSheffield United v Burnley was on the TV, and you watch with a sense of pride because he is doing exactly the same thing to Burnley defenders that he was doing to defenders in our league.\u201d\nEngland will take comfort in the one blot on Ndiaye\u2019s brief Hyde career: a skied penalty in a Cheshire Senior Cup match against Vauxhall Motors. He has certainly come a long way in a short time since."

                    "body": "Didier Deschamps paid tribute to Olivier Giroud after the forward broke France\u2019s men\u2019s goalscoring record in their 3-1 win against Poland. Giroud\u2019s 52nd strike for Les Bleus eclipsed a milestone set by Thierry Henry and Deschamps said it was just reward for overcoming criticism at various points in his career, including when he drew a blank during their triumph at Russia 2018.\nGiroud has scored three times at this tournament and France, the holders, look in menacing shape before the last eight. \u201cFour years ago he didn\u2019t score but he was still an important player,\u201d Deschamps said. \u201cHe has had difficult periods in his career. He has often been criticised but people are now seeing his quality. He stayed strong mentally and has broken a very difficult record held by Henry.\u201d\n\nSitting next to him was Kylian Mbapp\u00e9, who brought his international tally to 33 with two goals in the last-16 victory and, at 23, is 12 years Giroud\u2019s junior. \u201cAnother boy here might break it one day,\u201d Deschamps joked. \u201cTo score so many goals at international level is a great achievement. [Giroud] was already there when I arrived.\u201d\n\nMbapp\u00e9 leads the golden boot charts at Qatar 2022 with five goals but scotched any suggestion that pursuing the prize might distract him. \u201cThe only objective for me is to win the World Cup,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s my only dream. I didn\u2019t come to win the golden boot. If I do win it I\u2019ll be happy but that\u2019s not what I am here for.\u201d\nAlthough Mbapp\u00e9\u2019s performance, particularly after half-time, appeared to be masterful it earned mixed reviews from his manager. \u201cHe speaks on the pitch,\u201d Deschamps said. \u201cHe didn\u2019t have his best match tonight. He knows that himself but he can change a match in just a moment. He always plays with joy and we all want to share those smiles. France needed a great Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 tonight and they got one.\u201d\nDeschamps praised the understanding Mbapp\u00e9 and Giroud have developed since 2018, when the former operated in a more orthodox right-sided role. \u201cThey are now closer together and technically, over the years, have developed an understanding,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t mind if it doesn\u2019t work and we get the same result as in 2018.\u201d\nThe Milan player Giroud said his record was a \u201cchildhood dream\u201d and praised the \u201csolidarity and unity\u201d he believes has been critical to France\u2019s progress. They will play England or Senegal in the last eight after winning three of their four matches, scoring nine goals."
