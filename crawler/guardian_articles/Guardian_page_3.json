                    "body": "The big man is back. All two metres of him, hunching slightly to get through the door. Harry Souttar has the spring in his step of somebody who knows they have made it after all. \u201cIt was a long 12 months,\u201d he says.  A lot has happened since November of last year, when the Stoke City centre-half ruptured his anterior cruciate ligament playing a World Cup qualifier against Saudi Arabia. There was a long flight back to the UK before surgery and countless hours of rehab. This June, Australia finally qualified for the World Cup via the playoffs \u2013 a key motivation to fast-track his recovery. In August, he was mourning his older brother, Aaron, a talented golfer who died at 42 after suffering from motor neurone disease. Souttar arrived in Qatar with two new tattoos, both of which encapsulate what he holds dear. \u201cMy brother passed away three and a half months ago, so I\u2019ve got him on my arm just to remind me every day what a brilliant person he was,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd I got my cap number and the [Australian] coat of arms on my calf.\u201d Glance down and there it is, inked proof he is Socceroo No 606. Souttar\u2019s timely return is welcome in more ways than one. The 24-year-old is a well-liked member of the playing group, to the point that he was flown into camp before the decisive qualifier against Peru simply to boost morale.  He is also potentially the defensive difference in a tough World Cup group, his quickness of foot and skills on the ball belying the length of his limbs and his calm decision-making an invaluable settling force while facing big opponents such as France. Whether he is thrown straight against the reigning champions or saved for Tunisia and Denmark is unclear, given he only made his senior comeback in the English Championship on 8 November \u2013 one day after he was named in the World Cup squad. \u201cYou have doubts in your head along the way of being a year out,\u201d Souttar says. \u201cThere\u2019s obviously ups and downs, but I don\u2019t think I ever thought I wasn\u2019t going to make it. I always knew, with the hard work I put in to get here, I was going to do it in the end.\u201d It is hardly surprising these days to hear a Scottish accent wearing green and gold, given this team is becoming very much a blend of the two countries. Like attackers Martin Boyle and Jason Cummings, Souttar is Scotland born and bred, growing up in the small eastern village of Luthermuir and starting his professional career at Dundee United alongside his other brother and fellow defender, John. But while John, 26, stayed local, forging a career at Hearts before being capped for Scotland and joining Rangers in the off-season, Souttar moved to central England and found himself the subject of some close monitoring by Socceroos coach Graham Arnold, who knew his mother was born in Australia. He had played for Scotland\u2019s underage sides but not pledged his full international allegiance. Arnold made his move in March 2019, calling him up to his under-23s before handing him a senior debut that October in a World Cup qualifier against Nepal. He scored twice, and by the end of the first phase of qualifying had six goals from his first five games \u2013 as a central defender. He also developed a reputation for prowess on set-pieces \u2013 an unfashionable yet efficient way to win games.  \u201cSet pieces is a massive weapon, and if you\u2019ve got tools to utilise it I think anything would do,\u201d Souttar says. \u201cObviously we\u2019ve got some great deliverers of the ball. Aziz [Behich] is one of them \u2013 he can put it on a sixpence. Obviously I\u2019ve scored against some of the smaller-height nations, so to do it on the big stage would be great.\u201d But not, he says, because he wants to impress future club suitors and reignite the Premier League interest in him before the injury.  \u201cI don\u2019t think you can go into any tournament thinking that. Obviously as a player it\u2019s nice to get praise, but you\u2019re also only one match away from from criticism. So that stuff for me is irrelevant.\u201d While Souttar is not guaranteed to start against France \u2013 likely alongside Kye Rowles \u2013 he appears closer than Boyle (knee) and Ajdin Hrustic (ankle), who are now cutting it fine. That appears especially the case for Boyle, for whom Arnold has already flown in Marco Tilio as cover should he require a injury replacement on the eve of the opening match on Tuesday night (Wednesday 6am AEDT). At training on Saturday night the pair performed light duties on a seperate pitch from the main squad. \u201cI saw Boyley running yesterday just through the window of my room and Ajdin as well,\u201d says striker Jamie Maclaren. \u201dFrom my eyes they looked good but I think the medical staff will make a call whenever they can. \u201cBut they are two huge players for us and exciting players and players that have played a big part in the last four years. And from where I stand now, I think they\u2019ll be okay.\u201d"

                    "body": "Shortly after midday on 22 November 1963 Aldous Huxley, novelist turned consciousness-expander, was lying in bed dying. And not just dying, but dying on acid. As his wife prepped his final dose of LSD she heard on the radio that something else had happened. John F Kennedy had been shot. This presented a dilemma. Did Huxley really need to be told, that, by the way Aldous, I know you\u2019re dying on acid right now, but one of the most mind-blowing events of the 20th century has also just happened? In the event, Huxley was allowed to drift off, swaddled in his private ecstasies, undisturbed by half-grasped visions of grassy knolls or the Dallas police. And the reason for mentioning this here is that this image has sprung to mind a lot in recent weeks while being entertained and distracted by professional sport; and at the same time half-following the endless scroll of news and counter-news from what we must, out of habit, call the \u201creal world\u201d. There you are quietly deciphering the Cruyff-based iconography of Erling Haaland\u2019s flying volley, and someone keeps tugging at your sleeve saying, you really need to concentrate on the imminent hostile collapse of the established world order. They\u2019re opening \u201cwarmth-hubs\u201d in the north of England for when the gas runs out this winter. But hey, Todd Boehly\u2019s all-star game has DIVIDED football. Can you just keep it down for a bit? We\u2019re trying to die blissfully on acid in here.  In the middle of this there is one topic that keeps cutting across these two worlds; and which has for now been allowed just to sit there, unsolvable, unavoidable and uncomfortably grim. The thing is, we probably do have to think about it now. This week Gareth Southgate announced his squad for England\u2019s final fixtures before Qatar 2022. Last week Liz Truss announced that you will only have to pay \u00a32,500 on your energy bills, while also (follow the ball under the cup) funding this via \u00a3100bn in taxes. This week the French government also capped energy payments and, by extension, payments to Qatar\u2019s gas industry, at a cost of billons to their own public purse. Also this week Qatar opened the magnificent $767m Lusail Stadium, which really is a lot of money, but no biggie because they, and indeed you, have got this covered. Did we mention Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 scored again? Those dots are so connected it almost seems too obvious to draw a line between them. Everyone knows football is in hock to fossil fuels and ambitious nation states. But the war in Ukraine, the loss of Russian energy, the profiteering of Opec+ has put this into brutal focus. To the extent that it is worth taking a moment to consider how that flow of power and money is playing out, with football sat like a cackling Lord Haw-Haw in the middle of it. There is almost a kind of dark Fifa comedy here. A war started by the last World Cup hosts is now filling the coffers of the next World Cup hosts, while generating mind-boggling profits for the latest 2030 bidders and current owners of Newcastle United (a war that involved, needless to say, invading the hosts of Euro 2012. Take that Uefa!). In the middle of which there is a real prospect that two months from now you could be watching the World Cup under a blanket, while a nation that is profiting from you being under a blanket stages its grand spectacular, paid for by you being under a blanket.  Here is a spectacle that is, in the end, being paid for through your excess energy bills, even as the UK goes cap in hand for Qatar\u2019s gas reserves. Let me entertain you. But let me also impoverish you. Watch David Beckham shaking hands with the sheikh. Then go to the food bank. When will this not be OK? Closer to home, as the people of Britain seek relief from fuel poverty this winter, they will at least have the chance to celebrate the football glory paid for by those who benefit directly from this struggle. Menaced by global energy prices? Announce Demb\u00e9l\u00e9! A billion pounds in the window! Just keep looking at the lights. Give me just enough bread and just enough of a circus. Football is of course just a public relations strand here, a noise around the politics driving this dynamic. But shouldn\u2019t we at least be sceptical of that process? Shouldn\u2019t we mention it? Or factor in how we plan to consume it or celebrate the people in charge? And this really is a genuine power-shift. Recently, Saudi Aramco announced what are reportedly the biggest quarterly profits in the history of companies having profits, all of which bodes well, naturally, for Eddie Howe\u2019s complex squad-building needs. Those high prices are a result of the war in Ukraine. Plus, the UK buys most of its gas from Norway. But don\u2019t be fooled by the arms-length commercial relationships. In a market where prices and supply are agreed and inter-related there are only dealers and customers, led by a group at the centre that has complete control over the world\u2019s addiction to carbon. And in the meantime you\u2019re basically paying for this power-play every time you turn the heating on for a treat, paying for Shell\u2019s profits too, for EDF\u2019s profits, for Chris Wood\u2019s wages. This is of course everywhere in football. Chelsea\u2019s new owners have heavy Saudi investment, not connected to the purchase of the club. Abu Dhabi\u2019s national energy company, owned by the same people that own the league champions, has seen profits rocket by 63% during the energy crisis. Meanwhile about 15% of Greater Manchester households are living in fuel poverty, a horrendous state of affairs that will only get worse as the glorious winter of oil-ball closes in. But hey, Haaland looks good. And all the while it\u2019s getting just a little bit colder out there. Some supporters of those clubs will feel attacked by having these relationships pointed out, will call for silence on such issues, because they are complex and uncomfortable and essentially insoluble. Every club is touched by this in some way. No one is clean. All owners are foisted on us, no matter how deep their pockets. Life is hard enough. Sometimes you just need some relief. But it is also important to note this isn\u2019t simply about things like show or reputation management, but about control, resources and hard power. The visible end, the investment in PR through sport, should at least be consumed in full knowledge. Just as when, say, Alan Shearer proclaims that this is all unconditionally good and beneficial, loaning his celebrity glaze to the project, when there is no real analysis of why, just scores and points, then something is missing from the picture."

                    "body": "\nThe main event\nWe have reached that significant point in the group stage at which all 32 teams in Qatar have played. Whose name is on the 2022 World Cup, as far as we can see?\nSpain, most obviously, given the ease with which they swatted aside Costa Rica, starving their admittedly limited opponents of possession, while threatening the goal every time they went forward. The 2010 winners were unfortunate to be knocked out of last year\u2019s Euros after outplaying Italy in their semi-final, boast an increasingly accomplished coach in Luis Enrique, and potentially the breakthrough star of the tournament in the 18-year-old Barcelona schemer Gavi. Just try getting the ball off them.\nFrance were exceptional in dismantling Australia 4-1 in Group D, the ageing-like-a-fine-wine Oliver Giroud knocking in a couple of goals, the absurdly gifted Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 ominously shifting up a gear or two as necessary. Their coach, Didier Deschamps, has been around the block more than once, of course, even managing to rustle up the trophy in Russia four years ago. To borrow a well-worn horse-tipping catchphrase, Les Bleus are most certainly worth a second look.\n\nRicharlison, meanwhile, scored probably the finest goal of the first round of matches in Brazil\u2019s 2-0 dismissal of Serbia last night, swivelling on his own silky first touch and cracking a wonderful volley into the corner. The Tottenham forward got the first goal, too, and while Neymar started his tournament relatively quietly, Brazil\u2019s wealth of attacking talent and defensive solidity makes for a team you\u2019d rather avoid in the knockouts.\nEngland looked useful against Iran in that 6-2 win. With his box-to-box drive and all-round footballing intelligence, Jude Bellingham is inviting comparisons with Bryan Robson. The Borussia Dortmund midfielder continues to show a maturity well beyond his 19 years on and off the pitch. With Mason Mount, Bukayo Saka, Declan Rice, Phil Foden and Jack Grealish jostling for a place in the front six with the undroppable Harry Kane, this is an England generation with a hint of precious metal about them. Louis van Gaal\u2019s Netherlands found their way past a stubborn Senegal with a couple of late goals. If World Cups were handed out on managerial experience alone, the Oranje would be nailed on.\nArgentina\u2019s opening defeat by Saudi Arabia ranks as one of the great World Cup shocks: will Lionel Messi ever fulfil his destiny on the biggest stage? The same question could be asked of Robert Lewandowski, who missed a penalty in Poland\u2019s opening stalemate against Mexico.\nThere are tougher tests to come for Spain, sure, but that 7-0 thrashing was an eye-catching way to tune up for Sunday\u2019s sizeable collision with Germany, who succumbed to a dynamic Japan. Hansi Flick and co arrived with high hopes, but they need a result, or they will be going home early yet again. Football no longer lasts 90 minutes, as some of the mammoth stoppage times have shown, but will Germany win at the end? It may still be unwise to bet against it. LMc\nTalking points\nNo diminishing sense of interestFifa has released a set of figures that appear to contradict any idea of people disengaging from the World Cup, with viewing figures for the opening match up across the globe compared to 2018. According to the governing body, viewing figures in Brazil, France and the UK were all up on the opening fixture in 2018. In Ecuador \u2013 who won the opening match against Qatar 2-0 \u2013 a peak of 3.8 million viewers was recorded, from a total population of just under 18 million people. One slight caveat should be noted: the opening match of Russia 2018 was played on a Thursday, in the European afternoon, while Qatar\u2019s kick-off came on a Sunday, when most people would be off work. PMc\nA camping carry-onFans who checked into their World Cup campsites only to find them unfinished have been promised full refunds by the organising Qatari Supreme Committee (SC). Blaming \u201coperator negligence\u201d, the SC said that fans would be reimbursed for any money spent \u2013 with one night at a shipping container campsite costing around $200 \u2013 and provided with free accommodation for the rest of their stay, according to reports by ESPN. \u201cA section of units in these facilities, which are delivered and managed by different private entities, have not met the required standards that were advertised to the fans,\u201d an SC spokesperson said. PMc\nTeams not standing outAnother humiliating own goal for Fifa? The world governing body has been accused of ignoring its own guidelines after colourblind supporters endured a \u201cdisaster\u201d kit clash when Switzerland and Cameroon both wore their home kits, red and green respectively, for their Group G clash. Fifa regulations state that a team should switch kit or combine different items from its different playing kits as necessary in order to achieve such a clear distinction, even if the match has already started. Colourblindness affects one in 12 men and one in 200 women worldwide. Recent research by Colour Blind Awareness demonstrated 6% elite male players are colourblind (meaning an average of at least one player in every squad). \u201cYou\u2019d think that even if Fifa can\u2019t police their own regulations the national teams would, even if only to ensure their own players and teams aren\u2019t disadvantaged,\u201d said founder, Kathryn Albany-Ward. \u201cWe\u2019d like to know how the red/green colour combination for the Switzerland v Cameroon game was allowed and why one team did not change into an alternative kit at half-time in accordance with the regulations. As Fifa is based in Switzerland this is particularly embarrassing for them.\u201d BF\nBeyond the football\nYesterday, Iranian security forces arrested Voria Ghafouri, one of Iran\u2019s most famous footballers, accusing him of spreading propaganda against the Islamic republic and seeking to undermine the World Cup team. Ghafouri has been outspoken in his defence of Iranian Kurds, imploring the government to stop killing Kurdish people. He has previously been detained for criticising the former Iranian foreign minister Javad Zarif.\nThe Iranian team have already been embroiled in controversy after failing to sing the national anthem before the defeat by England, and Ghafouri\u2019s arrest is likely to be seen as a warning to the players not to repeat their protests. PW\nGlobal media-watch\nThe finger of blame continues to jab manically in all directions after Germany\u2019s shock defeat by Japan. In his role as a pundit for the broadcaster ARD, Bastian Schweinsteiger lamented \u201cbig mistakes again in defence\u201d and singled out Niklas S\u00fcle and Leon Goretzka for their role in Ritsu Doan\u2019s equaliser. \u201cThe pressure on the German team before the big match against Spain on Sunday is immense,\u201d writes Kicker. \u201cBecause when the world champions from 2010 and 2014 meet, the surprisingly early end of the World Cup threatens.\u201d WM\nThe internet reacts\nIn a sentence nobody wants to have to write, John Fashanu has been holding forth on the OneLove armband controversy. Whoever at Good Morning Britain thought that was a good idea, kudos on the worst decision since the crew of the Titanic opted to take a laissez-faire approach to avoiding icebergs. In possibly the most pitiable rant of the World Cup to date, Fashanu lamented: \u201cIf politics goes into football, which is what is happening, the politics go up, and up, and up, and eventually they will win.\u201d Of course, there\u2019s nothing political about a repressive regime using the biggest event in football to promote their soft power. A limited pro-equality gesture, though? Careful now, that sounds a bit provocative.\n\nElsewhere, Breel Embolo was the centre of attention after scoring against Cameroon, the country of his birth, to give Switzerland a winning start. While players are often derided for refusing to celebrate against former clubs, Embolo\u2019s muted reaction speaks to the complexities of personal identity and international football. What\u2019s more, it has spawned lots of good memes. WM\n\nToday\u2019s matches\nWales v Iran (Group B, 10am GMT, BBC One) It seems a bit surreal given we\u2019re only six days into the tournament, but it\u2019s crunch time for Wales. Having eked out a 1-1 draw with the USA, they need a win against Iran or even Gareth Bale\u2019s knack for the miraculous might not be enough to take them into the last 16. Wales struggled with Dan James up front, rallying after half-time when he was replaced by Kieffer Moore, so Rob Page may well utilise Moore\u2019s hulking link-up play against an Iran side outmuscled in the air by England. For Iran, whatever happens, this tournament will be remembered for their unflinching bravery regardless.\nQatar v Senegal (Group A, 1pm GMT, BBC One) Costa Rica may have stolen their thunder as the worst team so far, but Qatar were dreadful in their opener against Ecuador. Lose to Senegal and they will effectively be out of their own World Cup after two games. Given that this is an event built on human misery, few will feel sorry if, as seems likely, Qatar become only the second host to go out at the group stage after South Africa in 2010. Senegal had their moments against the Netherlands and will be confident of beating a side that failed to get a shot on target in their curtain raiser.\nNetherlands v Ecuador (Group A, 4pm GMT, ITV) Having left it late against Senegal, the Netherlands will be looking for a more dominant performance against Ecuador. Louis van Gaal admitted his team were \u201cshoddy in possession\u201d in their opener, so Frenkie de Jong and his fellow midfielders are under pressure to be better on the ball. They may have been comfortable winners against Qatar, but Ecuador weren\u2019t exactly spectacular. Mois\u00e9s Caicedo is the engine and will be tasked with overpowering De Jong and co.\nEngland v USA (Group B, 7pm GMT, ITV) England have met the USA twice before at the group stage without beating them. A 1-1 draw in South Africa was the first indicator that all was not well with Capelloball \u2013 or Roonismo, to use the proper Italian term \u2013 while a 1-0 defeat in Belo Horizonte in 1950 still ranks among the biggest upsets in the history of the competition. Believe it or not, the USA have come on a bit over the last 72 years. Christian Pulisic may be their poster boy, but Timothy Weah looks equally dangerous. WM\nPlayer to watch\nJoe Allen He may no longer be the sprightly young thing that helped to propel Swansea to the Premier League \u2013 even if his career has since taken him full circle and back to his boyhood club \u2013 but Allen remains a crucial player for Wales. Out since September with a hamstring injury, he has now returned to full training. Having struggled to retain the ball against the USA, particularly in the first half, Wales have been crying out for Allen\u2019s experience and assuredness in midfield. Whether or not he is ready to start against Iran, he could have an important role to play. WM\nAnd finally \u2026\nHaving adorned their training base with rainbow flags, Wales have become the latest side to essentially stick two fingers up at Fifa for their aggressive intervention against the OneLove armband. \u201cFor months and months we have known we were going to wear the OneLove armband and they certainly did,\u201d Noel Mooney, the Football Association of Wales\u2019s chief executive, told ITV. \u201cTo lay that one on us is pretty cheap and pretty low, to be frank \u2026 we have given Fifa everything we have got in terms of how furious we are about this decision. We think it was a terrible decision.\u201d WM"

                    "body": "The European parliament has voted to strip a Greek MEP implicated in a bribery and corruption scandal of her role as one of the body\u2019s vice-presidents.\nMEPs voted by 625 votes to one, with two abstentions, to remove Eva Kaili as one of the parliament\u2019s 14 vice-presidents, following a decision in favour of the move by the assembly\u2019s senior leaders.\n\u201cThe group chairs in the European parliament unanimously voted for the removal of vice-president Kaili\u201d tweeted the German MEP Terry Reintke, co-president of the Green group, before the vote. \u201cWe also agreed to a full inquiry into the matter and taking further preventative measures.\u201d \nThe European parliament has been rocked by the biggest scandal in its history after Belgian prosecutors announced they had charged four people with corruption, money laundering and participation in a criminal organisation, as part of an investigation into attempts by a Gulf state, named by Belgian media as Qatar, to buy influence in the assembly.\nSince Friday, police have raided European parliament offices and 19 private homes, finding data and hundreds of thousands of euros in cash.\n\nKaili is one of four people charged, although she has not been officially named. She has been remanded in custody and will be brought before a judge on Wednesday.\nBreaking Kaili\u2019s silence on Tuesday, her lawyer said she was innocent. \u201cHer position is she is innocent. She has nothing to do with Qatar\u2019s bribes,\u201d her lawyer, Michalis Dimitrakopoulos, told the Greek television channel Open TV.\nPolice seized computers, mobile phones and \u20ac600,000 (\u00a3515,000) in cash at one home, as well as \u20ac150,000 in a flat belonging to an MEP and \u201cseveral hundred thousand euros\u201d from a Brussels hotel room, according to the public prosecutor.\nAsked if any cash was found at Kaili\u2019s home, Dimitrakopoulos said: \u201cI am not confirming or denying. There is confidentiality. I have no idea if money was found or how much was found.\u201d\nKaili has been expelled from the European parliament\u2019s Socialists and Democrats group and Greece\u2019s Pasok party, and Greek authorities have frozen her assets.\nAn MEP from Cyprus\u2019s governing Disy party has claimed that Kaili approached him to amend a highly critical European parliamentary report on LGBTQ and other human rights in Qatar.\n\u201cThis can happen among colleagues,\u201d Loucas Fourlas told Sigma TV. \u201cBut when I saw the amendments concerned Qatar I got a flea in my ear and called the general director at the foreign ministry and told him as Cyprus we shouldn\u2019t get involved. The amendment said Qatar wasn\u2019t so strict on human rights and homosexuality [...] things that would have watered down the report.\u201d\nMEPs have postponed a vote on granting Qatari citizens visa-free travel rights to the EU, which was scheduled to have taken place this week. \u200b\u200b\n\u201cWe must ensure that this process has not been influenced by corruption,\u201d said the German Green MEP Erik Marquardt, who is in charge of the file, which also affects Kuwait, Oman and Ecuador.\n\u201cWe also have to make sure that any attempt to attack our democracy has consequences. For now, we will not proceed towards visa liberalisation for Qatar.\u201d\nSeparately, the Spanish liberal MEP Jos\u00e9 Ram\u00f3n Bauz\u00e1 announced he was suspending the EU-Qatar friendship group. Such friendship groups have no official status and, according to the European parliament\u2019s website, are \u201csometimes sponsored by lobbyists and foreign governments\u201d. \nQatar has denied any wrongdoing.\nEU leaders are expected to discuss the scandal when they meet the European parliament president, Roberta Metsola, on Thursday at a regular summit in Brussels. The president of the EU executive, Ursula von der Leyen, has said the allegations were of \u201cutmost concern\u201d and promised to act on a 2019 promise to set up an independent ethics body for all EU institutions.\nThe Guardian also understands that at least four MEPs from the Socialists and Democrats group employing parliamentary assistants who are subject to the Belgian police investigation have stood down from roles in the parliament while the inquiry is ongoing, at the request of the group.\nThe anti-corruption NGO Transparency International said the affair appeared to be \u201ca bribery and corruption scandal of epic proportions\u201d that demanded \u201croot and branch reform of the EU institutions\u2019 ethics and integrity systems\u201d."

                    "body": "The Greek MEP at the centre of a corruption scandal engulfing the European parliament will have to wait in prison until next week to find out whether she will be released on bail pending a trial. The Greek Socialist MEP Eva Kaili is one of four suspects arrested last week in connection with a major police investigation into cash for influence involving Qatar\u2019s government. In a statement, Belgium\u2019s public prosecutor said \u201cdefendant EK\u201d had not been present at the hearing, \u201chaving requested a postponement\u201d, and would appear before the judicial chamber on 22 December. However, Kaili\u2019s lawyer, Andre Risopoulos, told AFP that she had not been able to attend court because of a staff strike in the prison where she is being held. Another lawyer for Kaili told the agency she was innocent and denied \u201cfalse rumours\u201d that she had received bribes from Qatar. Michalis Dimitrakopoulos said the MEP \u201cdid not know of the existence\u201d of the cash found at her home. He said that Kaili\u2019s partner, Francesco Giorgi, might have \u201canswers about the existence of this cash\u201d. Giorgi, a parliamentary assistant, has also been arrested and found out on Wednesday he will remain in pre-trial detention. Qatar\u2019s government has denied any wrongdoing. Two suspects, identified as FG and PP, will remain in pre-trial detention, the Belgian prosecutor said, while a third was said to be subject to an electronic tag. The European parliament, currently meeting in Strasbourg, is still reeling from the biggest corruption scandal in its history, while senior politicians have warned that the EU\u2019s credibility is at stake. David McAllister, chair of the European parliament\u2019s foreign affairs committee, told the Guardian he felt anger and fury at the \u201ctotally incredible\u201d situation. \u201cIt is just appalling to see that we have an ongoing police investigation regarding corruption, money laundering and participation in a criminal organisation.\u201d \u201cThis whole story reminds you of a bad Netflix series and it is sad reality,\u201d said McAllister, a centre-right German MEP. On Wednesday Belgian police released photos of neatly stacked bundles of cash worth nearly \u20ac1.5m that had been seized during raids on 20 addresses in Brussels since last Friday.  A Belgian judicial source told Agence France-Presse that \u20ac150,000 was found in Kaili\u2019s flat, \u20ac600,000 in her partner\u2019s home, and \u20ac750,000 in her father\u2019s hotel room. Police have also searched several European parliament offices in order to seize data for their investigation. Several bureaus, including Kaili\u2019s, are now sealed off with police tape. MEPs are expected to vote on Thursday in favour of setting up a special committee to identify problems in the European parliament\u2019s transparency, integrity and anti-corruption rules. The parliament is also considering setting up an inquiry committee to investigate corruption and third countries once the current legal proceedings have concluded. According to McAllister, the parliament will call on the European Commission to issue a long-delayed proposal on an EU-wide ethics body. He added that the parliament would also discuss the \u201cproper regulation and monitoring of the friendship groups\u201d, unofficial bodies that can be sponsored by lobbyists and foreign governments. The European parliament\u2019s Qatar friendship group has been suspended since the scandal broke. MEPs voted overwhelmingly on Wednesday to remove Kaili as one of the European parliament\u2019s 14 vice-presidents. The former television presenter has also been expelled from the parliament\u2019s Socialists and Democrats group and Greece\u2019s Pasok party, while Greek authorities have frozen her assets. European leaders are expected to discuss the scandal on Thursday, when they hold a regular meeting with the European parliament president, Roberta Metsola, at an EU summit."

This followed Fifa instructing seven European nations, including Germany, that their captains should not wear the OneLove armband, which stands for tolerance, diversity and LGBTQ+ rights.\nAfter the shock defeat Germany faced criticism that their protest had caused a lack of focus. Van Gaal was asked about this. \u201cThat is the question,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to run that risk \u2013 we\u2019re here to be a world champion \u2026 We put a full stop behind all the political issues [last] Thursday when we invited the migrants and we have this purpose. We are not going to have that tarnished by the actions of Fifa or whichever other organisation.\u201d\n\nBelgium\u2019s Eden Hazard echoed Van Gaal. \u201cGermany\u2019s gesture? They would\u2019ve done better if they didn\u2019t do it and tried to win,\u201d the forward told RMC Sport. \u201cWe\u2019re here to play football, I\u2019m not here to convey a political message.\u201d\nIt was put to Van Gaal that those back home were experiencing the World Cup differently because the spotlight remained on Qatar\u2019s human rights issues. \u201cThat has got to do with the environment in the Netherlands,\u201d said the 71-year-old. \u201cA different environment than what we see here. \n\u201cEverything has been organised in an excellent way. No criticism whatsoever. Perhaps it\u2019s all about human rights [at home] and maybe rightly so but also perhaps not rightly so. I believe I\u2019ve responded enough to that.\u201d\n\nCody Gakpo scored the Netherlands\u2019 second in their opening 2-0 win against Senegal, the 23-year-old\u2019s fourth goal in his 10 games. Van Gaal believes the PSV forward can be a breakout player of the World Cup. \u201cHe is a player with a lot of talent and possibilities,\u201d said the coach. \n\u201cHe is young and is a player who is still evolving and has a lot of room for improvement and has a personality that will do everything that it takes. Whether he will be a star at this World Cup, I don\u2019t know, but it is possible.\u201d\nThe Netherlands face Ecuador on Friday with Memphis Depay, who had had a hamstring problem, being fit to play a half at least after managing half an hour against Senegal. Van Gaal admitted selecting him in the squad contravened his usual code regarding players who are not fully fit.\n\u201cThis is a player that is quite extraordinary [so] I\u2019ve set aside my principles because I believe he is incredibly important to us,\u201d Van Gaal said. \u201cI explained this to the players. I do all this for Memphis and the players understand this. He played 30 minutes and really isn\u2019t grappling too much with the issue so we\u2019re proceeding to the next step, which is 45 minutes.\u201d"

Maguire is back in full training and available for Thursday\u2019s penultimate Europa League group game against Sheriff at Old Trafford. United need to avoid defeat to qualify for the knockout stages. Ten Hag said: \u201cHe always has an important role. He was injured and is happy he is back and now he has to get back into games. It\u2019s always about performance. Regarding his qualities \u2013 no problem. He is a great player and has great capabilities to do a job for us.\u201d The manager was asked whether Maguire\u2019s need for matches before the World Cup in Qatar would influence his thinking. \u201cI understand the interest but we especially look at Manchester United. We have to get the right results and performances,\u201d he said. Varane may recover and be available for France\u2019s defence of the World Cup. \u201cI think so but we have to wait and see how it develops, how his rehab develops,\u201d said Ten Hag. \u201cHe will certainly be out until the World Cup.\u201d Cristiano Ronaldo is back in the squad after a one-game suspension for refusing to come on during last week\u2019s win over Tottenham and exiting down the Old Trafford tunnel before the final whistle. \u201cI think we said everything and we answered all the questions,\u201d Ten Hag said.\u201d With Anthony Martial still injured, Ronaldo may start.

                    "body": "Seventeen World Cup debutants walk into a bar. They\u2019re all asked for ID, questioned on whether they are grown-up enough to be here. Six of them, after all, only had their first drink in September against New Zealand. Nine have thrown back five or fewer. Now here they all are, in Qatar, seeking a bit of Dutch courage against reigning champions France.\nFor many Australians back home setting their alarms for Wednesday\u2019s early morning kick-off, this 26-man Socceroos squad will feel unfamiliar. Granted, some quarters of the nation still live long in the past, as if they cryogenically froze themselves in 2010 and cannot work out why the so-called golden generation are no longer around.\n\nBut times have changed significantly, and so has the national team. These days those better-known figures such as Mark Schwarzer are asking the questions, sitting with the media and inviting one of those debutants, Kye Rowles, to recount his rapid rise from the Central Coast Mariners to Hearts and the national team.\n\u201cIt\u2019s real but it still feels surreal, if that makes any sense,\u201d the defender tells him. \u201cStill sinking in at the moment. We were in club football on the weekend. It\u2019s just one of those pinch-yourself moments, as you would know. That was my first one. I can\u2019t even explain it. I made my debut in June and now it\u2019s November and it\u2019s had a World Cup. It\u2019s just been so quick, I\u2019m almost lost for words.\u201d\nFor context, Rowles was seven when Schwarzer famously saved two penalties in the 2005 qualifying playoff shootout against Uruguay to help send Australia to a first World Cup in 32 years. Now 24, it remains \u201cpretty much the most iconic football memory in my lifetime\u201d.\n\u201cThat\u2019s really the moment that set off me wanting to get to this moment. It wasn\u2019t as dramatic, but we recreated our own moment as well in June,\u201d he says, referring to Andrew Redmayne\u2019s own penalty heroics in the playoff against Peru.\nAnd this, really, is the point. While expectations for this tournament are realistically humble, this new generation are planting the seedlings of an identity.\n\u201cI think it\u2019s great to see the next generation coming through,\u201d Schwarzer says afterwards. \u201cWhat I actually also am really happy about is we\u2019ve got more and more coming to Europe, because I still believe 100% that that\u2019s the best place for our players. If they really want to progress, and really want the Socceroos to get to the highest possible level we can, we need as many players as possible playing at the best leagues around the world.\u201d\n\nThat is the fruition of four-and-a-half years under coach Graham Arnold, who made the ambitious decision to also manage the Under-23 team so he could oversee young players\u2019 transition to senior international football.\nHe qualified the Olyroos for the Olympics for the first time in 12 years. Eight Under-23 members of that Tokyo 2020 team made the World Cup squad, notable by the absence of some more senior players including Tom Rogic, Adam Taggart and Trent Sainsbury.\n\u201cI do feel, if there is a legacy, it is the young kids coming through,\u201d Arnold said last week. \u201cWhen I took over in 2018 it was an ageing squad, I was thinking, \u2018where am I going to get these players?\u2019 Losing players like Jedinak, Cahill, Milligan and Kruse, where was I going to replace them?\u201d\n\nThe Olympics acted as a springboard, with a dozen of that squad soon earning Socceroos caps and a chunk signing with overseas clubs. The most popular destination has been Scotland, where Rowles, Cameron Devlin and Nathaniel Atkinson now play for Hearts and Keanu Baccus for St Mirren, while older heads Aaron Mooy and Martin Boyle are at Celtic and Hibernian respectively.\n\u201cCredit to all the boys who are here because we worked hard to get to that Olympics, and that gave us the experience of men\u2019s football,\u201d says Baccus. \u201cIt was 23s, but for us it was a big step up from where we were all playing. Most of us were playing in the A-League, so it was a good challenge and good experience for us to go through together. And obviously Arnie there with us, which helped integrate us into the national team.\u201d\nSchwarzer describes club football in Scotland as \u201ca stepping stone\u201d. \u201cSome would say it\u2019s only Scotland, but it\u2019s Europe and it\u2019s on the doorstep,\u201d he says. \u201cThe chance of moving to other European leagues is far greater when you\u2019re in Europe.\u201d\nThe more senior squad members who were at Russia 2018 under Bert van Marwijk already have experience playing two of Australia\u2019s 2022 Group D opponents France and Denmark, to whom they lost 2-1 and drew 1-1, with the less familiar foe of Tunisia sandwiched in between.\n\u201cI remember [France] being a close game and feeling we were a little bit unlucky,\u201d says Mooy, who believes this squad is capable of taking something from their opening game.\n\u201cThere\u2019s no point being here if you don\u2019t believe that. We need application, focus. These sorts of things are hugely important to make the most of this opportunity. We want to have a positive performance, maybe surprise a few people. That\u2019s the goal.\u201d"

                    "body": "This World Cup is starting to feel a bit South Africa 2010. Australia\u2019s 4-1 humbling at the hands of France in Qatar on Wednesday stirs up a sentiment similarly portentous to that of 12 years ago, when Australia started their campaign with a 4-0 drubbing by Germany in Durban.\nThe team, under the tutelage of the late Pim Verbeek, recovered via a 1-1 draw with Ghana \u2013 despite Harry Kewell\u2019s early red card \u2013 and went on to beat Serbia 2-1. But the damage had been done in the first match. Too many goals had been shipped, and they finished third in their group on goal difference.\nThe Socceroos of today find themselves in a comparable position, and now face the daunting task of climbing back up the hill France tossed them down to stop history repeating itself.\n\n\u201cOf course now the stakes are higher for the second game,\u201d midfielder Jackson Irvine said the day after the opener. \u201cBut at the end of the day you know you\u2019re going to have to get two positive results to progress, and we\u2019ve still got full belief that that\u2019s achievable.\u201d\nGraham Arnold\u2019s side are in a marginally more promising position than the class of 2010, with one goal in their favour courtesy of that Craig Goodwin scorcher that had the country believing \u2013 for a beautiful 18 minutes \u2013 that an upset of the defending champions might be on the cards.\nWhat it means is they must beat Tunisia in their second match on Saturday and also pray that France score another hatful against Denmark, who were held to a 0-0 draw by the less-fancied Tunisia in their opening fixture. That would put Australia in a positive position going into next Wednesday\u2019s third and final match with Denmark.\n\nDraw with world No 30 Tunisia and the outlook is more difficult, with a win over Denmark the minimum requirement plus a hope other results fall their way. A loss would effectively spell the end of their Qatar 2022 campaign.\nIn short, the team have two days to prepare for the Tunisians, who they have not played since a 2-0 Confederations Cup loss in 2005. The North Africans will have a 12th man in a big and extremely vocal contingent of Tunisian fans largely made up of a 55,000-strong expat community in Qatar. It could make for a hostile atmosphere back at Al Janoub Stadium, where Australia are playing all three of their group fixtures.\n\nRight now, though, the priority for the players is moving on mentally from the gut-wrenching loss against what Arnold called a \u201cbigger, faster and stronger\u201d France. Irvine said it still felt \u201cquite raw\u201d, but the group had starting shifting focus to their next opponent.\n\u201cThe key is using last night as a platform to build into Saturday rather than overthinking how that game went,\u201d Irvine said. \u201cTactically there are lessons to be learned. We need to defend crosses better \u2013 to concede three goals from wide areas is a very clear lesson for us to learn.\n\n\u201cWhen we were on the front foot early in the game we looked a totally different kind of threat. Obviously you\u2019ve got to be aware of the individual quality of the opposition, especially when you\u2019re playing against players of that pace \u2013 you don\u2019t want to be leaving too much space in behind. But I think when we played on the front foot, when we pressed high, that was where we had our most joy.\u201d\nTunisia, led by captain Youssef Msakni, matched 10th-ranked Denmark in both attack and defence, creating chances and targeting Christian Eriksen. That performance will increase confidence the team can reach the knockout stage after five unsuccessful attempts.\n\u201cThis will obviously be a very different opposition; the game will flow in a totally different way,\u201d Irvine said. \u201cAgainst a team that can play so compact ... you are going to have to find different ways to create chances.\n\u201cWe have got the quality of players who can play in those areas out wide or in between lines and create chances to score goals. We will look at where are the best areas to hurt them but not much changes within the framework that we\u2019re always trying to do.\u201d\nThe key for Australia could be attacker Ajdin Hrustic, who has not played since 3 October because of an ankle injury and was unused against France, but could yet play a crucial role in this game.\n\u201cHe\u2019s a quality player, obviously we want him out on the pitch as soon as he is available,\u201d Irvine said. \u201cI am sure he will have a big role to play in these next couple of games.\u201d\n"

Everyone seems compelled by a magnetic attraction, approaching the football ground as if it contains the holy grail or a UFO. And Lowry shows us why this game looms so large in their lives. What else have they got? Grey chimneys hang in the milky air above a landscape of dreary toil. The dearth of colour is shocking. But the crowd are all individuals: women and men, workers and clerks, all inspired by the common passion that turns a Saturday afternoon into a supercharged special time. This is why football became the people\u2019s sport. Jonathan Jones * * * Television  Much has, and will, be written concerning Qatar\u2019s human rights record, particularly in terms of the freedoms of LGBTQ+ people and their treatment by the state. For that reason, a look back at Britain\u2019s own complicated relationship with football and homophobia feels timely \u2013 and the 2017 documentary, Forbidden Games: The Justin Fashanu Story, shines a spotlight on the first man to publicly weather the storm of it all. A remarkable patchwork of Black footballing history, political gossip and transracial adoption, this film will make you mourn Britain\u2019s first \u00a31m Black footballer, who died aged just 37. Jason Okundaye * * * Music  For somebody who isn\u2019t overly fussed about football, a World Cup is much more about feeling and atmosphere than it is about genuinely rooting for any one team. Nonetheless, when I think of the beautiful game, my mind instantly goes to the 2002 JXL remix of the Elvis classic A Little Less Conversation. For ever synonymous with Nike\u2019s big-budget \u201csecret tournament\u201d advert, the song is as light and nimble on its feet as the endless big-name stars the ad showcased, uniting pitch and dancefloor in giddy, sweaty euphorics. It\u2019s a formative World Cup memory for millennials \u2013 I\u2019d take it over World in Motion or Sweet Caroline any day. Jenessa Williams * * * Film  Corneliu Porumboiu\u2019s delightfully deadpan film Infinite Football understands that the beautiful game is about more than the movement of a ball across a field. Ironically, however, this fact has eluded its amusingly sadsack star, Laurentiu Ginghin\u0103. A mid-level Romanian bureaucrat, he spends his spare time frowning owlishly at a whiteboard on which he outlines ever more hilariously impractical ways to reform the sport, from octagonal pitches to seven-player teams to the construction of a wall on the halfway line. But the profound truth at work here is not that football is a matter of life or death, it\u2019s that life and death are a matter of football: when Ginghin\u0103 dreams, in increasingly erratic, unenforceable ways, about \u201cperfecting\u201d the game, really he\u2019s dreaming about perfecting the world. Jessica Kiang * * * Book  In 1974, the great manager Brian Clough lasted just 44 days in charge at Leeds United (even fewer than Liz Truss had as prime minister). Even so, the repercussions of his short tenure have been felt ever since. Not least because the author David Peace immortalised this brutal chapter in footballing history so well in The Damned Utd. His novel takes us deep inside the head of \u201cthe boss\u201d as he berates his own players for their thuggish, cheating ways. Those players (understandably enough) revolt against him and the hitherto all-conquering Leeds race down the table. The football was disastrous, but the resulting novel is intense, thrilling and unforgettable. Sam Jordison"

                    "body": "Emily Tuttosi grew up on the Canadian prairies but even that vast expanse is not as wide as the funding gap between her largely amateur teammates and England\u2019s full-time professionals. When the two sides collide in a Rugby World Cup semi-final this Saturday, the Red Roses will be instantly reminded what true sacrifice and extraordinary dedication look like. The 27-year-old Tuttosi is one of the fortunate few who play their club rugby in England \u2013 in her case for Exeter Chiefs \u2013 but many of her fellow squad members have been forced to make \u201creally hard choices\u201d such as declining job offers, refusing promotions or postponing their final degree exams simply to make it to this tournament.  Some went further still and gave up their homes. \u201cPeople gave up having a permanent residence and just moved wherever the team has gone for the last six months,\u201d says Tuttosi. \u201cThe support we\u2019ve had has been huge but there\u2019ve been girls who have had to put off their careers and learn to live like broke students again. It\u2019s part of what makes our group special. Everything we do has been with a view to playing in this weekend\u2019s game.\u201d With Covid having severely hampered Canada\u2019s recent playing opportunities, the Exeter hooker and her colleagues have been shuttling between England, New Zealand, Vancouver Island, Nova Scotia, Fiji and now New Zealand again to train, play and make themselves properly competitive once more. \u201cWe knew we had to catch up somehow,\u201d says Tuttosi. \u201cPersonally I\u2019ve been living out of a suitcase I packed in Exeter last May. Some call it sacrifices, others call it tough choices.\u201d Beating England would make everything worthwhile and Tuttosi has already been reaping some dividends with six tries, second in the tournament only to New Zealand\u2019s Portia Woodman. The next challenge is to stand firm against England\u2019s forwards, some of whom Tuttosi has previously played alongside. \u201cIt\u2019s no secret England have always been pretty strong. They\u2019re such a technically sound team. But I think we\u2019re ready for battle. I\u2019ve played with a decent handful of them, especially during my time in Loughborough, but it\u2019s all business on Saturday.\u201d  As a proud daughter of Manitoba \u2013 \u201cI\u2019m a classic Canadian. I\u2019ve literally tapped trees to boil sap to make maple syrup\u201d \u2013 she also wants to show that England do not possess a monopoly on hard-nosed intent. \u201cWe\u2019ve taken a lot of pride in bringing a physical Canadian brand of rugby. We know the set piece is a good foundation for us and I think we have to take things like that personally. Taking individual accountability will help us be collectively better on the day. \u201cThis week I think the pressure is more on them. Everywhere we\u2019ve been it\u2019s always \u2018England are number one.\u2019 We\u2019re just going to focus on us and get ready to go. We\u2019re proud of being the only \u2018amateur\u2019 team in the final four but it\u2019s not something we can settle for. As a team we strive to be our best no matter what. As a player what I\u2019d love to see this weekend is two super competitive semi-finals which showcase what women\u2019s rugby is. I think this tournament has done a great job of showing that women\u2019s rugby is growing and it\u2019s not to be taken lightly.\u201d And by the time the next World Cup kicks off, in England in 2025, she also hopes the financial gulf between a few richer squads and the rest will have been at least partly addressed. \u201cWhere the funding comes from I\u2019m not too sure but it\u2019s been proven that if you make programmes professional there will be clear results. It\u2019s just a question of when more nations can take that step.\u201d"

                    "body": "Jos Buttler was the mastermind and the master technician as England ripped up both rulebook and form guide in Brisbane to derail New Zealand\u2019s runaway train and reignite their own hopes of winning the T20 World Cup. A game they could not afford to lose was won by 20 runs and will allow them to head for Sydney and their final fixture against Sri Lanka with confidence high and the semi-finals in their sights. When Buttler won the toss and chose to bat first \u2013 a common enough decision by captains across this tournament but one he has rarely come to \u2013 it was an indication that he was approaching this game with a fresh outlook. And having hauled his team towards a total of 179 with an innings of 73 off 47 balls \u2013 though he was dropped twice, on eight and on 40 \u2013 he led them on to the field and produced a display of captaincy that fed to the shredder a template he has often followed to the letter.  Moeen Ali did not only bowl \u2013 for the first time in the tournament \u2013 he took the opening over; Mark Wood did not touch the ball until the last over of the powerplay, by which time both Sam Curran and Adil Rashid had had a go. Moeen and Liam Livingstone, who Buttler had acknowledged in the buildup had not been given enough of a chance to influence games with the bat, came in at three and four respectively. This was the night the Elton John tribute band turned in a surprise jazz-funk set. \u201cTo score some runs for the team and then a couple of times you make a decision and it comes off straight away, it\u2019s always nice when that happens,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can look at numbers till the cows come home but I think the feel is really important. My own captaincy journey is still pretty young, and as it evolves I think I\u2019ll get even more of a feel for what I like. I came off having batted and thought that Moeen should bowl the first over \u2013 I didn\u2019t think that leading into the game, but it\u2019s important to see what\u2019s in front of you, to trust your instincts and your experience.\u201d By the end even the decisions forced upon him were paying off: Livingstone felt some soreness in his ankle and spent the last few overs off the field, allowing Chris Jordan to come on and take up position at long-on.  Daryl Mitchell and Glenn Phillips duly sent the ball soaring straight to him, and the resulting catches effectively settled the contest. \u201cI said to CJ, I think any time the ball goes up he\u2019d be my No 1 pick in the world to be under it,\u201d Buttler said. New Zealand\u2019s captain, Kane Williamson, had a few surprises of his own. There had, for example, been much attention in the buildup on the potential for England\u2019s middle-order left-handers to punish his spinners, so Mitchell Santner came on early, Ish Sodhi joined him not long after, and of the first six overs of spin all but two balls were directed at Buttler and Alex Hales, the right-handed openers. During this period England\u2019s innings lost its way a little, and they scored 37 runs, and only three boundaries, off those first 36 balls of spin. Meanwhile Moeen, whose reputation against spin is unrivalled in this England team, watched from the sidelines, padded up but sitting down. Halfway through their innings England had lost no wickets but scored only 76, and at the drinks break they clearly discussed a change of tack. It was time to go big or go home, and Hales went with option two. He reached his half-century off his next ball, top-edged for four, and was out to the one after that, stumped after skipping down the pitch to Santner. For all that England never significantly accelerated, the feeling as their innings ended was that having put themselves in a position to post a genuinely daunting target they never quite got round to it. On the eve of the game Buttler might have been a bit spooked at the prospect of outmanoeuvring Devon Conway, hero of the Kiwis\u2019 thrashing of Australia; Finn Allen, their powerplay tornado; Phillips, whose century anchored them to victory over Sri Lanka, and the twin terrors of last year\u2019s semi-final, Mitchell and Jimmy Neesham. But of those only Phillips really fired, savaging 62 off 36 after being inexplicably dropped by Moeen when he was on 15. The match finally turned on a run of four wickets in as many overs from as many bowlers, between the 15th and the 18th, of which Phillips\u2019 was the last. His departure spelt the end for New Zealand, and for England perhaps a new start. For them this was a night when all that mattered was winning, but they emerged from it with fresh confidence in their ability, in their approach \u2013 and in their captain."

Our love is to this team.\u201d\nThe Supreme Committee also said football fans celebrated differently based on where they were in the world. \n\u201cQatar, and the rest of the world, is comprised of a diverse range of football fans, many of whom share emotional connections with multiple nations,\u201d it said. \u201cIn different places around the world, fans have different traditions, different ways to celebrate, and while that may contrast with what people are used to in Europe or South America, it doesn\u2019t mean the passion for football is any less authentic. Journalists on the ground who speak to and meet these fans are realising the reality.\u201d\nThe tournament kicks off on Sunday, with Qatar facing Ecuador."

                    "body": "For Qatar, this was a letdown 12 years in the making. The host nation has spent that time building the infrastructure of a World Cup shrouded in controversy and replete with a bitter taste that, whatever the next four weeks bring, is unlikely ever to be washed away.\nWhen they kicked off this tournament, however, the hope locally was for a bravura show from the meticulously constructed football project that has run concurrently with the creation of a manicured, deeply unsettling fantasy sporting land from sand. Instead they flopped, left for dust by a stronger and cannier Ecuador unit who dealt the hardest of truths about how life at this level really looks.\n\nThe manoeuvres honed by F\u00e9lix S\u00e1nchez\u2019s players across that time were barely evident and it was doubly ignominious that Qatar became the first home side to lose an opening game. No other outcome seemed likely after the moment, three minutes in, when Enner Valencia thought he had silenced the party. The goal was eventually disallowed by VAR for the most borderline of offsides but Qatar\u2019s defence, and especially their goalkeeper Saad al-Sheeb, were clearly ripe to be picked off.\n\nThat impression was quickly justified when Valencia, fouled by Sheeb, converted a penalty. His outstanding header after the half-hour removed any remaining edge and long before the end swathes of this vast, textured tent-like structure north of Doha had virtually emptied. The envisaged extravaganza had not materialised and it would take a vast improvement against Senegal on Friday to give Qatar any chance of progress. Ultimately this was a non-contest, a dissatisfying spectacle and, with due credit to a competent Ecuador, a poor reflection on what should be football\u2019s showpiece.\n\u201cMaybe the responsibility and nerves got the better of us,\u201d S\u00e1nchez said of a pallid display that, given this was billed as the logical apex of a country\u2019s footballing journey, must have felt hugely anticlimactic. \u201cWe had a terrible start and this determines the rest of the match. We\u2019ll just have to forget about the pressure and be more competitive. We can do it.\u201d\n\nAt least the award and dispatching of Valencia\u2019s spot-kick ascribed less importance to the controversy around his disallowed opener. The overrule looked marginal at best and came after Sheeb had flapped under a free-kick, allowing a combination of F\u00e9lix Torres and Michael Estrada to locate Valencia with the custodian stranded. There was widespread confusion when it was chalked off: Fifa\u2019s semi-automated system probably decided Estrada\u2019s foot was beyond Sheeb, with only one defender back, when Torres headed on.\nPerhaps the stars were aligning for Qatar, who would have faced murmurings about injustice had the call decided things. Nobody could accuse their country of failing to produce an off-pitch show. Morgan Freeman had been reeled in to front the high-spec opening ceremony, intoning weighty thoughts about football\u2019s ability to unite, but Ecuador were a class apart in those opening moments. Qatar could neither retain possession nor a sensible measure of concentration.\nThey were behind soon enough when a sluggish Sheeb came out to meet Valencia and clipped him on the shin. A penalty, a booking and no further scope for suggestions of favouritism; Valencia scored coolly and, at that point, Qatar looked vulnerable whenever Ecuador attacked.\nThere was visible frustration in the kick on Valencia for which Almoez Ali was cautioned. Valencia\u2019s revenge was emphatic, finding space between two defenders and leaping thrillingly to plant Angelo Preciado\u2019s cross past Sheeb after persistence from Moises Caicedo. The former West Ham and Everton player, now 33, has still got it.\n\u201cHe was questioned at times but now we see how much he gives us,\u201d the Ecuador manager, Gustavo Alfaro, said of the country\u2019s all-time leading scorer. \u201cIf I have to choose, I always choose Enner Valencia.\u201d Whether he can do that for their next game, against the Netherlands, depends on his recovery from multiple knocks.\n\nSurely Qatar had more to offer. They are the Asian champions and, in what should have proved a useful exercise, did not disgrace themselves when guesting at the Copa Am\u00e9rica three years ago. It was obvious they had frozen on this surprisingly brisk evening; their football was lightweight against technically and physically superior opposition.\nNonetheless Ali, the star of that continental win, headed wide with the first half\u2019s final action. He had been unmarked and perhaps a cleaner contact would have belatedly put Qatar at ease. It might have ignited the contest but, instead, it was virtually the final action of note.\nEcuador could cruise through the second period, occasionally squandering openings on the counter. Romario Ibarra allowed Sheeb slight redemption with a parried shot but little else raised the pulse as the crowd drifted away. \u201cWe hope in the next game people feel prouder,\u201d S\u00e1nchez said. It was the heftiest blow to his adopted nation\u2019s self-esteem."

                    "body": "In an effort to avoid a potential clash between the Three Lions and the three kings, the Church of England is advising vicars to reschedule Christmas carol services due to be held on World Cup final day. The guidance to clergy, under the heading \u201cMaking the most of the World Cup final\u201d, warns of the possible difficulties of holding a carol service on Sunday 18 December. The Sunday before Christmas is a traditional time for afternoon or evening festive services. With the final due to kick off at 3pm, the C of E says services \u201ccould still be possible if you choose the time carefully \u2026 but what if there are penalties?! It may be best to avoid that day altogether and host a carol service on Saturday 17 instead.\u201d But it adds: \u201cDespite this clash of dates, football and faith don\u2019t have to be at odds with one another.\u201d Football and the church have a \u201cconjoined heritage\u201d, it says, as several Premier League clubs \u201cstarted up as parish church football teams, set up for the health and wellbeing of those local communities\u201d. The guidance suggests ideas for how parish churches could encourage people to \u201cuse the World Cup as a missional tool this Advent and Christmas\u201d. They include watching games at local sports clubs or pubs or inviting neighbours to your home. \u201cOffer to lead some carols, perhaps sharing a sport and faith testimony after the game, with an invitation to Christmas services.\u201d Alternatively, parishes could screen games in church with refreshments, or host a Christmas sports day instead of regular worship, \u201cweaving together a range of sport and Christian values\u201d. Another idea is to stage a football-themed nativity play. The C of E has created two scripts that parishes can download, involving the three kings following the star to an adaptation of the anthem Football\u2019s Coming Home. \u201cWe\u2019re coming west / We\u2019re coming west / We\u2019re coming / Kings are coming west.\u201d The C of E has acknowledged the controversies surrounding the World Cup in Qatar. In an article on the C of E\u2019s website, Libby Lane, the bishop of Derby and the C of E\u2019s lead bishop for sport, said: \u201cThere are serious concerns about the treatment and safety of workers, especially migrant workers. I am concerned about the discrimination which women face in Qatar, both in law and practice. And I am concerned for the safety of LGBTI+ supporters travelling to the World Cup, and who are impacted by the decision to play the World Cup in a country which criminalises homosexuality \u2026 \u201cI personally do not think that the World Cup should ever have been awarded to Qatar, and I support those individuals and nations who are making a stand at the tournament, on behalf of migrant workers, women and LGBTI+ people.\u201d Sport should never be \u201ca smokescreen for discrimination, oppression and exploitation\u201d, she said."

                    "body": "With a month to go until the opening match of the World Cup, human rights abuses \u201cpersist on a significant scale\u201d in Qatar, according to Amnesty International. In a final pre-tournament report, Amnesty said progress has been made by the Qatari state on the protections afforded migrant workers. But weak regulations and a lack of enforcement means there is \u201cstill a long way to go\u201d, the organisation says. Amnesty calls for a number of actions, including support from Qatar and Fifa for financial compensation for workers.  \u201cDespite the positive evolution of Qatar\u2019s labour system, substantial work remains to effectively implement and enforce these [changes],\u201d the report says. \u201cUltimately, human rights abuses persist on a significant scale today.\u201d Among its observations, the report finds that workers in security and domestic labour remain particularly vulnerable to exploitation, with some expected to work up to 18 hours a day without a weekly day off. Furthermore, Amnesty argues, there has been insufficient research into the thousands of deaths of those working in construction in the country over the past decade and the contribution played by extreme heat.  The report also finds vestiges of the abolished kafala system in the country and states wages are still commonly withheld from workers. Steve Cockburn, Amnesty\u2019s head of economic and social justice, said: \u201cAlthough Qatar has made important strides on labour rights over the past five years, it\u2019s abundantly clear that there is a great distance still to go. \u201cWith the World Cup looming, the job of protecting migrant workers from exploitation is only half done, while that of compensating those who have suffered abuses has barely started.\u201d \u201cProgress must not grind to a halt once the World Cup roadshow leaves Doha. Turning a blind eye to the abuses suffered by thousands of migrant workers over the years flies in the face of their respective international obligations and responsibilities.\u201d Last month, the English Football Association endorsed a compensation scheme for workers and their families involved in building the World Cup infrastructure in Qatar. They were joined by a number of other associations, with the United States Soccer Federation adding its name this week. Fifa and World Cup organisers, however, have yet to confirm their commitment to such a scheme. Fifa said : \u201cFifa remains in positive ongoing dialogue with the International Labour Organization, the International Trade Union Confederation (ITUC) and all relevant authorities in Qatar over initiatives that will benefit migrant workers in Qatar long after the final game of the World Cup. Further information will be provided in due course.\u201d The Qatari supreme committee for delivery and legacy said: \u201cThe advancements in workers\u2019 welfare is a legacy we are very proud of, and one that we are already seeing in action. We have always believed that the World Cup will be a catalyst to accelerate positive initiatives, leaving a legacy of meaningful and sustainable progress for the country and region. \u201cOur progress has been recognised by one of the world\u2019s largest trade unions, Building and Wood Workers\u2019 International (BWI), the UN International Labour Organisation (ILO), and we welcome the recognition by Amnesty International, highlighting that our work has \u201cimproved the living and working conditions of thousands of migrant workers\u201d and that it \u201crepresents an unprecedented and significant improvement in the living and working conditions. \u201cWork is ongoing and there is of course still room for improvement. We are continuing to explore alongside key partners the opportunities to enhance the legacy that improves the lives of workers and lays the foundation for fair, sustainable and lasting reforms.\u201d"

                    "body": "And now, finally, some football. For much of the 12 years since Sepp Blatter\u2019s fumbling fingers ripped open an envelope containing one word and a thousand questions, the 2022 World Cup has been able to exist in our minds as little more than a surreal abstraction. A computer-generated simulation. Some Philip K Dick-infused vision of a future that might never come to pass; that could even somehow be averted if we made the right choices. But the time for daydreaming and denial is over. This is happening. Matty Cash is going to Qatar, and to greater or lesser extents, we\u2019re all going with him.\nWhy? How? Why here? Why now? And \u2013 frankly \u2013 what the hell? Just a few of the more intelligible responses to a project that from its grubbily cynical inception has felt like a giant step into a sun-scorched unknown. This is not the first World Cup to be held in the shadow of totalitarianism. It is not the first to be awarded under questionable premises, nor the first to be built at a ruinous expense to the public exchequer and the planet. But in most other respects it is like nothing this sport will ever have seen before.\n\nOf course, you didn\u2019t choose this. Nor did the players or coaches. A winter World Cup in a tiny desert state with no footballing heritage and a litany of human rights abuses to its name was instead imposed upon us by the 22 men of Fifa\u2019s executive committee, three of whom are now dead. There is, perhaps, a certain dark irony in the fact that the survival rate of the people who awarded the World Cup was even lower than that of the people who built it. But the very existence of this tournament is a reminder of where the power has always resided in this sport. You are of course welcome to turn up, tune in and enjoy. But this spectacle is not yours, and never has been.\nSo perhaps the first thing we can do is to shake ourselves free of the idea that anything that happens on the pitch over the next month can ever redeem or mitigate its colossal moral expense. Football loves to spin this self-serving yarn about itself: the notion that whether through noble escapism or shared joy or athletic beauty, it serves in some small way to make the world a better place. But in this case of Qatar 2022, football has made the world measurably and noticeably worse. It has quite literally killed people. How you feel about that is totally up to you. But the very least we owe the victims of this World Cup is our present remembrance and future vigilance.\n\nAlmost inevitably, very little of this human wastage will impinge on the show itself. Those of you watching on television will encounter pretty much the same curated, star-studded, heavily branded, tournament-flavoured substance you know and love. For those involved, Qatar will be experienced in much the same way they experience everywhere else: through the windows of a bus, on a familiar treadmill from hotel room to dressing room via pool and training ground, by the reassuringly stateless whiff of fresh paint on temporary plasterboard. The heat may be a factor. The lack of atmosphere may be a factor. Fatigue and curtailed preparation time will certainly be a factor. So, what sort of tournament can we expect?\nThe temptation is to home in on the stars, to weight our analysis towards the household names. Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 and Robert Lewandowski, Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo, Kevin De Bruyne and Vin\u00edcius J\u00fanior, Sadio Man\u00e9 and Gareth Bale. And individual brilliance will certainly have a part to play in this tournament, particularly in the latter stages where the margins are at their finest.\nBut by and large it is cohesive teams rather than great collections of players \u2013 or even great coaches \u2013 who tend to go deep at World Cups: teams with a defined style of play, a collective understanding and a sense of their own momentum. Recall that a ruthlessly drilled Russia and a baggy Brazil both did equally well at the last World Cup; recall too that Croatia did better than both. Star quality can raise expectations and occasionally get you over the line. But it is never sufficient on its own.\n\nPerhaps the most interesting distinction to be made is between those teams with a distinct identity based on possession and high pressing, and those who in tough times will fall back on the classic tournament nostrums of counterattack, set pieces and individual inspiration. In the former group: Hansi Flick\u2019s mercurial Germany, the gilded but largely untested Brazil, Luis Enrique\u2019s exciting Spain, the last gasps of a great Belgium side and the Netherlands under the idiosyncratic tutelage of Louis van Gaal.\nIn the latter group: the quietly fancied Argentina, defending champions France, the talented but limited Portugal and a limping England that appears ripe for another bout of navel-gazing angst culminating in an early exit. Neither approach, by the way, is objectively better than the other. Pragmatism worked for Portugal in 2016 and France in 2018, for Argentina at last year\u2019s Copa Am\u00e9rica and Senegal at this year\u2019s Africa Cup of Nations. Ideology triumphed for Germany in 2014, for Brazil in 2019 and Italy in 2021. Further down the pecking order the relevant divide is between more explosive and direct teams like Canada and Ecuador, or teams like Iran and Costa Rica who will simply sit in and try to limit the damage.\nWales travel to their first World Cup in 64 years with high hopes of upsetting the odds again, even if their deep-lying system seems to invite pressure. Poland, boasting one of the world\u2019s greatest strikers and one of Aston Villa\u2019s best full-backs, have a favourable group as they attempt to reach the knockout stages for the first time since 1986. Switzerland and Serbia would both be highly fancied were they not unfortunate enough to be drawn in the same group as Brazil.\n\nPerhaps the greatest unknown, however, centres on the hosts. Qatar\u2019s squad is entirely domestic-based and has not played a competitive match in a year. But they are perhaps the best-prepared of all the squads this winter, and what they lack in raw talent they will make up in organisation and nationalistic zeal. They may just spring a surprise.\nIn short: we just don\u2019t know. No World Cup has ever taken place under these circumstances, midway through a European domestic season, with a heavy toll of injuries (N\u2019Golo Kant\u00e9, Paul Pogba, Diogo Jota, Son Heung-min and Paulo Dybala are among those out or in doubt) and teams that have barely spent any time together in months. \nMaybe anger is the appropriate response here: anger at the lack of compassion or foresight, anger at the way powerful men have simply strong-armed this ruinous tournament into existence. But equally, this thing is also irresistibly enjoyable. The football starts, and everything else stops. There will be upsets, there will be feats of greatness, there will be heartbreak and there will be triumph. To celebrate these things is not to condone them; it\u2019s simply all there is. A non-alcoholic toast, then, to Qatar 2022, and the weirdest, most horrifying good time we\u2019ll ever have."

                    "body": "Metaphorical new dawns in sport occur more frequently than actual sunrises. Many are false dawns, overblown by journalists and fans hoping to bask in the golden glow of some fresh perspective peering over the horizon. There is no need for verbose hyperbole when analysing the significance of this Women\u2019s Rugby World Cup. In the five years since the last tournament, the profile of the game has dramatically altered. Four teams are fully professional. Three more are either professionalising or are bolstered by a handful of full-timers. England, New Zealand, France, Canada, USA, Wales, Italy and Scotland are among the preeminent sides or are teams on the rise, staring into the sunlight at the vanguard of this new age.  Off to the side, partially shrouded in the shade of amateurism, are the Wallaroos, a talented team undergoing their own transformation narrative, but one still playing catch-up with the best. \u201cWe\u2019re realistic about the situation in Australian rugby,\u201d says Shannon Parry, the team\u2019s captain, who won gold with the sevens team at the 2016 Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro. \u201cWe know what we\u2019re up against. All we can do is focus on ourselves.\u201d Long looks in the mirror have been necessary. In July last year, Dwayne Nestor, the then head coach, and his deputy, Matt Tink, resigned in ignominy. Jay Tregonning, a physical education and health teacher at Illawarra grammar school in Wollongong who served as an assistant coach with the Wallaroos at the 2014 World Cup, was given the top job. Part of his remit was overseeing a cultural reset within the camp. \u201cThat came easy, I suppose, because of my background as a teacher and my knowledge of the team environment,\u201d he says. \u201cBut my primary job is to take the team forward and improve things on the pitch. We believe we\u2019re close to competing with the bigger teams.\u201d His tenure got off to a positive start, beating Fiji 36-19 at Suncorp Stadium in May. But six losses on the bounce, including a 52-5 drubbing by New Zealand in August, means that solitary victory has receded from view. Thankfully, there is more recent success from which to draw on. The 34-year-old Sharni Williams and Bienne Terita, 19, named at inside-centre and right-wing respectively for Saturday\u2019s opener against the Black Ferns at Eden Park, became world champions when they helped Australia claim the Rugby World Cup Sevens title in Cape Town last month. \u201cThe\u2019ve given everyone a lift,\u201d says Tregonning. \u201cYoung Bienne, has been electric and Sharni brings so much experience to our backline. They\u2019ve raised the energy in the group. It\u2019s always good to have a few winners around.\u201d  That triumph has helped garner interest across rugby\u2019s codes and Parry believes her sport is close to something special. \u201cIt\u2019s a massive moment, we\u2019re all so aware of that,\u201d she says. \u201cThis World Cup is a landmark moment for women\u2019s rugby. \u201cWe\u2019re also looking towards 2029 [when Australia will host the event]. We\u2019re standing on the shoulders of legends who have come before, but we\u2019re also laying down our own markers. We\u2019re so conscious of the responsibility we carry. \u201cWe\u2019ve worn the indigenous jersey this year and we\u2019ve started to better understand what it means to be a Wallaroo, why we play for our country and why we play this game. That was a missing piece for a while. Jay has been a big part of addressing that. We\u2019ve got a great culture going on at the minute. Now we need to back that up with results.\u201d  Despite the string of defeats, there have been some close games that might have gone another way but for the bounce of the ball or a different option taken. Since Tregonning has taken over, the Wallaroos have kicked 50% of their shots at goal. This, along with what Parry describes as \u201ca struggle with putting in an 80-minute performance\u201d, has hampered their progress. Rectify both of these areas of concern and they might yet achieve their stated goal of qualifying for the quarter-finals. To do so they will have to beat at least one professional team. New Zealand look light years ahead, which puts more pressure on the games against Wales and Scotland. Not that Parry is thinking beyond the curtain-raiser in Auckland. More than 30,000 tickets have been sold, which will set a new attendance record for a women\u2019s match. \u201cI can\u2019t wait,\u201d Parry says with a beaming smile. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a black-out but there\u2019ll be a sprinkling of green and gold in the stands. My parents will be there and so will my partner. It\u2019s going to be incredible.\u201d"

This would be a cause not for regret but for celebration and can surely be hastened by adopting a concept used to fight apartheid South Africa: no normal sport in an abnormal society. Thousands of migrant workers have died for the World Cup to be staged by a misogynistic and homophobic state that values dollars over deaths, and the society of the spectacle over the substance of humane practice.Darryl AcconeJohannesburg, South Africa I admire Joanna Cannon\u2019s stance in deciding for moral reasons not to watch the World Cup (\u201cTo watch it would make me complicit. A passive approver of homophobia\u201d, Comment), but wonder whether she will also be boycotting her beloved Liverpool\u2019s games against Newcastle United, who are owned by the equally unpleasant regime of Saudi Arabia?Ken GamblesKnaresborough, North Yorkshire Art and artificial intelligence While Laurie Clarke is right to draw attention to the dangers of generative AI in matters such as copyright, this is not a purely materialist issue (\u201cAI can create pictures \u2013 but can it make art?\u201d, New Review). The very term \u201cownership\u201d is always problematic, especially now, with its more modern, Californian twist. Worse still is casual use of the word \u201ccreate\u201d instead of \u201cgenerate\u201d. Images generated by AI, like the amusing image shown of a Renaissance person sitting at a laptop, are universally \u201cflat\u201d. However realistic or clever, they lack that element of sensate appeal that is the key element in genuine art. In an age of more and more photographs, films, TV and images on phones, we should be mindful that it is the connection between the human eye and the pulsing human brain that determines the value of art. In the performing arts of course, that brain also feels voices (not just words), melodies (not just sounds) and the ambience of \u201cthe room\u201d. This is what defines art, not \u201cpix\u201d.Steve GoochRobertsbridge, East Sussex Whom to trust on NHS data? Thank you for your excellent report on the collection of NHS patients\u2019 medical records to create one of the world\u2019s biggest health data platforms (\u201cTrump backer\u2019s firm \u2018lined up\u2019 for \u00a3360m NHS England data contract\u201d, News). It is of huge concern that the contract for this \u201cfederated data platform\u201d looks likely to go to Palantir, a corporation known to have provided surveillance technology for the CIA, among others, and with a reputation for eroding privacy on an unprecedented scale. The lack of public consultation about a federated data platform is shameful, not least because of the claim that patients\u2019 privacy will be protected due to the data being \u201cde-identified\u201d or pseudonymised. It\u2019s worth remembering that Prof Ben Goldacre, commissioned by the government to review how the inherent value of NHS data can be extracted effectively and safely, admitted to a Commons inquiry that he\u2019d opted out of a previous plan to mine patients\u2019 data. This was because he mistrusted claims that pseudonymisation ensured privacy. The public should have a voice on how their data is used and who can be trusted to do this.Jan SavageLondon E1 Caution: bullies at work Workplace bullying is poorly understood (\u201cWestminster behaviour should not be tolerated in the modern workplace\u201d, Editorial). We all recognise it when a co-worker says \u201cslit your throat\u201d but this is bullying at the severest end of the spectrum. It is the serial undermining, ridiculing, making mountains out of a molehill, intimidations (cc\u2019ing everyone), shifting blame, false accusations and feigning of victimhood that wears down workers without recognising that they are victims of bullying. When you call it out, the bully feigns victimhood and indignation that you dare suggest that their behaviour is inappropriate, making you believe that you might be in trouble. They turn into the \u2018tone police\u2019 and often with the help of their enablers who are not themselves bullies but want to be in the bully\u2019s good book.  Bullies bully to deflect from their inadequacy, usually incompetence, but it could be plain laziness or criminal activity. An incompetent worker lasts less than a year, but an incompetent, bullying worker lasts until retirement. Unless their bullying is too manifest; example is the incompetent nasty that is Gavin Williamson. Workplace bullying is around 20 years behind the understanding of domestic violence. We used to only recognise it when there was \u201cwife beating\u201d. Now we recognise coercive abuse. Marriage counseling for domestic violence is now rightfully recognised as further abuse (mediation for workplace bullying is further abuse too). We no longer blame the victim of \u2018provoking\u2019 her husband. We have a long way to go with workplace bullying.Dr Ellen KrieselsLondon EC1 Stop whining, ENO Melvyn Bragg argues that arts money is being \u201cstolen\u201d from London (\u201cLevelling up is a worthy aim. But stealing arts cash from London is cultural vandalism\u201d, Comment). Living in the east Midlands, I can assure him the opposite is true. Londoners will get around \u00a317 of Arts Council money spent on their spoilt little heads; here in the east Midlands, we\u2019ll get around \u00a34. The English National Opera needs to put the emphasis on national, stop whining and get on an overpriced train and move up to Manchester. Just like everyone else has to do when they want to access their arts in London.Sharon MaherWigston, Leicestershire All aboard the skylark As head of natural capital for Nattergal, the new owners of the Boothby Wildland project in Lincolnshire, it is important to correct the assessment of Boothby\u2019s current ecological baseline (\u201cVillagers divided over giving \u2018bread basket of England\u2019 back to the birds and the beavers\u201d, News). While we expect to see huge ecological gains in our project across the intensively farmed arable land, it is contentious to refer to Boothby as \u201cbereft of insects, [with] only a few skylarks\u2026 and precious little life\u201d. Through our ecological baselining this summer we have come to learn that the field margins, cover crops and woodlands at Boothby are hotspots for nature, with diverse insect communities, high populations of skylarks, hares and yellowhammers and some rich floristic margins. While the intensive arable itself is of low biodiversity value, the agri-environment plots and areas historically managed by the farm and shoot provide a strong head start for life to recover from across the rest of the land. We must move away from binary language, polarised positions and the idea that there is only one route forward, working together and through dialogue, there is space for us all.Ivan de KleeHorsham, West Sussex Protect children online  Of course children should have the strongest protections in the online safety bill, but scrapping the need to take action on legal but extremely harmful content would be a huge own goal for sites and undermines any suggestion of the UK being a safe place to go online (\u201cChildren\u2019s online safety at risk if key bill is made weaker, minister told\u201d, News). Harmful suicide and self-harm online content doesn\u2019t suddenly become safe the moment you turn 18, and research shows that the internet has a role to play in increasing suicide risk. We urgently need protections for people of all ages from this material, whether it is on a large and well-known site or a small forum. The online safety bill has been five long years in the making; we can\u2019t allow this to be ripped up now.Julie Bentley, Samaritans chief executive, Ewell, Surrey"

                    "body": "\u2018My mission,\u201d Zanele Muholi has said, \u201cis to re-write a Black queer and trans visual history of South Africa, for the world to know of our resistance and existence\u201d. With photographs that range from small to colossal, this self-proclaimed \u201cvisual activist\u201d captures people in their communities, people who have often been subjected to violence because of their sexuality. Muholi tells their marginalised stories. Born in 1972, Muholi grew up in South Africa during apartheid, and was a young adult when the brutal system came to an end in 1994. This was meant to usher in a new era of political and social progress: the 1996 Constitution of the Republic of South Africa banned all discrimination on grounds of gender and sexuality. Ten years later, the country legalised same-sex marriage, the only one to do so in the entire African continent. Yet queer communities still face injustices daily, from abuse to much worse. Muholi took up photography in their youth. \u201cI was going through a rough period,\u201d they once told the Guardian. \u201cThe camera was a tool through which I could speak about whatever was inside \u2013 the feelings, the pain, the personal experiences.\u201d Weaving their stories into art history, placing them on museum walls for all to see, Muholi makes LGBTQ+ people visible so that \u201cfuture generations will note that we were here\u201d. In 2006, Muholi sought to build a living archive for the queer community through Faces and Phases, a vast series that contains more than 500 photographs. It tells us about the individuals who are shaping this new South Africa \u2013 and also risking their lives by defiantly looking into Muholi\u2019s lens and stating: \u201cI am here and my story deserves to be told.\u201d  Tinashe Wakapila, from Durban, features in the series, their Instagram bio describing them as \u201cPoet, Civil Rights Activist, Feminist, Revolutionary Human, Model, Queer AF\u201d. Muholi also photographed Lungile Cleo Dladla, from the township of Kwa-Thema, who in 2010 was raped by a man with a gun and subsequently diagnosed as HIV positive. \u201cJust existing daily,\u201d says Muholi, \u201cis political in itself.\u201d In 2009, three years after same-sex marriage became legal, there was a sign of how far South Africa still had to go. Lulama Xingwana, minister of arts and culture, was criticised for walking out of an exhibition featuring Muholi\u2019s photographs. Xingwana called the show \u201cimmoral, offensive and going against nation-building\u201d and judged it a threat to children. How will discrimination end if the government, rather than driving positive change, chooses instead to condemn anything that raises awareness about the experience of LGBTQ+ people? Muholi, at their exhibition at London\u2019s Tate Modern in 2020, chose to leave gaps on the walls in the display of photographs from Faces and Phases. The decision seemed to echo the invisibility of these people \u2013 and speak to their loss, their death, through hate crimes. The gaps also suggested those yet to be photographed.  How long will it take for all people to feel safe \u2013 and heard \u2013 in this world? This is the question posed by Muholi\u2019s work and it feels especially resonant this month as the World Cup kicks off in Qatar, where same-sex sexual activity is illegal. Khalid Salman, the country\u2019s World Cup ambassador, recently called homosexuality \u201cdamage in the mind\u201d. One prominent activist claimed that gay Qataris have been promised safety from torture in return for helping the authorities to track down other LGBTQ+ people in the country. Fans who hang LGBTQ+ flags in stadiums will be removed, apparently.  Echoing the response to the South African culture minister\u2019s refusal of LGBTQ+ representation, James Cleverly, the British foreign secretary, was criticised for urging fans to be \u201crespectful\u201d of Qatar\u2019s culture. Does Cleverly really want an idle acceptance of something so deeply unjust? This keeps the issue out of sight and such invisibility is damaging. It all makes Muholi\u2019s growing archive feel more necessary than ever. One can only imagine what effect it would have on young queer people in Qatar to see brave, defiant faces proudly asserting their identities and telling the world their stories."

                    "body": "Football, once Brazil\u2019s great unifier, has in recent years fallen victim to the country\u2019s polarised politics. The yellow and green football shirt, emblematic of a national team that has won a record five World Cups, is now shunned by many Brazilians who associate it with the outgoing far-right president Jair Bolsonaro and his authoritarian brand of nationalism. \u201cI used to feel proud of wearing the Brazilian football shirt. Not any more. Now I feel dread,\u201d said Regina Valadares, a copywriter from the southern city of Florian\u00f3polis. The shirt evokes \u201cshame\u201d and \u201cdisgust\u201d for the 43-year-old as \u201cit represents everything bad about this government.\u201d Now however, Brazilians distressed by such associations hope that the World Cup, coming hard on the heels of Bolsonaro\u2019s electoral defeat to Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva last month, will provide an opportunity to reclaim the colours and reconcile the country with the amarelinha, as the world-famous shirt is affectionately known.  \u201cThere is a struggle over the shirt, which fits into a bigger struggle, a fight for Brazil and its national symbols,\u201d said Luiz Antonio Simas, a historian and author of a book about Rio de Janeiro\u2019s Maracan\u00e3 stadium. Left-leaning pop stars and politicians wore the canary yellow shirt during the election campaign in an attempt to recover it from the far right. More recently, the Brazilian Football Association (CBF) launched a campaign that seeks to depoliticise the football jersey. Amauri Bevilacqua, 29, said he will wear the amarelinha when Brazil plays in the World Cup. To do otherwise would be \u201cto let the other side take possession of a symbol that has always united all Brazilians, which is football\u201d. But the Rio-based environmental engineer does not yet feel comfortable wearing the shirt outside of match days, for fear of being mistaken for a Bolsonaro supporter. The broad appropriation of Brazil\u2019s national colours by the right began in 2015 during protests against the government of Lula\u2019s ally Dilma Rousseff, and have since become symbols of bolsonarismo.  More recently, the colours\u2019 political overtones have been reinforced by radical Bolsonaro supporters who reject the election results and have blocked roads and camped outside army headquarters demanding a military intervention. To avoid confusion progressive Brazilians are embracing alternative versions of the amarelinha such as those sold by Thain\u00e1 Pinho, a 27-year-old business graduate from Rio\u2019s working-class suburbs. Her line of yellow and green T-shirts, modelled on the retro version of the football jersey first worn by the Sele\u00e7\u00e3o in 1954, features progressive symbols like the red star of Lula\u2019s Workers\u2019 party or the LGBTQ+ flag. \u201cI hope that during the World Cup, everyone unites and wears the shirt, whether with a red star or not,\u201d said Pinho, who sees her Revolta Can\u00e1ria brand as part of a movement of resistance against the far right\u2019s appropriation of Brazil\u2019s national symbols.  Lula himself has urged Brazilians to embrace the tarnished colours. \u201cWe do not need to feel ashamed of wearing the green and yellow shirt. The shirt does not belong to a political party, it belongs to the Brazilian people,\u201d the president-elect recently tweeted, adding that during the World Cup he would wear a yellow shirt emblazoned with the number 13 \u2013 his Workers\u2019 party\u2019s electoral number. But this process of reappropriating Brazil\u2019s national symbols from the far right will not happen overnight, warned Simas. \u201cEven with Bolsonaro\u2019s defeat, lots of people who do not identify with this bolsonarista far right do not feel comfortable using the national team\u2019s shirt again,\u201d he said, adding that he was leaning towards wearing Brazil\u2019s blue away shirt during the World Cup games. Football-mad Bevilacqua clings on to a more optimistic view. He hopes Brazil will win its sixth World Cup and that a sporting victory might go some way towards healing the country\u2019s divisions. Brazil is the bookies\u2019 favourite to win this year\u2019s tournament, a title it last secured in 2002 \u2013 the year Lula won his first presidential election. \u201cIt\u2019s a good sign,\u201d said Bevilacqua. \u201cMaybe 20 years later, history will repeat itself.\u201d"

                    "body": "England and Australia awoke on Friday morning in the knowledge that if they took the field one of them would almost certainly see their T20 World Cup hopes evaporate before the day was out, but in the end it was the evaporation of water that became the key issue. Scheduled to begin at 7pm the match was eventually abandoned a little under two hours later, allowing both sides to continue dreaming of the semi-finals for a few more days at least. After the best part of four days\u2019 constant rainfall it always felt like an occasion when the teams would be less likely to have to deal with losses than galoshes. But when the covers were peeled off the pitch at about 7pm and the groundskeepers embarked on a frenzied half-hour of soaking and mopping there was the prospect of cricket, rather than incessant drizzle, in the air. Two pitch inspections came and went before, a few minutes before a scheduled third and with the ground still dangerously soft, the rain returned and all hope ended.  Despite their stays of execution, both teams said they would have preferred to play even an abbreviated five-over-a-side game than not at all. \u201cYou want to play full games of cricket, but that\u2019s part of what makes our game unique, what makes it great,\u201d Jos Buttler said. \u201cAustralia against England at the MCG in a must-win World Cup match is as big as it gets in your career and no matter what the result was going to be, it\u2019s something you want to experience. You don\u2019t know how often those kind of opportunities will come around.\u201d So Group One remains completely open, with the match between Ireland and Afghanistan abandoned in the afternoon and all teams involved awarded one point. With seven of the group\u2019s 15 games played \u2013 or abandoned \u2013 all six teams are separated by a single point, with England second, behind New Zealand on net run rate and just ahead of Ireland, Australia, Afghanistan and Sri Lanka \u2013 who play the Kiwis in Sydney on Saturday, mercifully with no rain forecast. After that game attention will move to balmy Brisbane before a crucial 48 hours. Ireland are scheduled to play Australia on Monday, while on Tuesday Afghanistan play Sri Lanka and England face New Zealand. Every side knows that victories in all their remaining games will probably see them through, though net run rate could be crucial. England have the slight advantage of contesting the group\u2019s final match, against Sri Lanka, at which point they will know precisely what they must do to progress \u2013 if indeed they still have a chance at all, having stood on the brink of elimination since Wednesday\u2019s shock defeat to Ireland. \u201cWe are still in the competition and know, to a certain degree, we have our destiny in our own hands,\u201d Buttler said. \u201cThere is still lots of confidence in the group. We have some great players who are determined to right some wrongs from the other night. This is what World Cup cricket and knockout cricket is about \u2013 these huge games and being able to perform in them.\u201d The abandonments mean that of the five matches so far scheduled to be played in Melbourne only one has gone ahead as planned, with one other game \u2013 between Ireland and England \u2013 reaching a result despite being abbreviated by rain. Two more matches are planned for the city: the final game in Group Two between India and Zimbabwe on 6 November, and the final itself a week later. \u201cThe weather has just been so bad \u2013 since it started raining in the England game it just hasn\u2019t stopped,\u201d said Ireland\u2019s Andrew Balbirnie after their game was called off. \u201cIt\u2019s just so wet out there. You come to Australia thinking you won\u2019t need a hoodie or a rain jacket, but it\u2019s certainly been different since we arrived three or four weeks ago.\u201d  Though October is normally the wettest month in Melbourne, this spring the city \u2013 and much of the east coast of Australia \u2013 has been dealing with a freak confluence of meteorological phenomena: the Indian Ocean Dipole, the Southern Annular Mode, and La Ni\u00f1a, when strong trade winds blow west across the Pacific Ocean. \u201cWe have been in a pretty wet period for a while in Victoria and right along Eastern Australia \u2013 there\u2019s been flooding from Queensland to Tasmania,\u201d Christie Johnson, a senior meteorologist at the Australian Bureau of Meteorology, told the Guardian. \u201cIt\u2019s quite common in spring to get a lot of weather systems coming through Victoria, but this year is unusual by historical standards. The three climate drivers together are combining to give us the perfect storm.\u201d Meteorologists have been forecasting an unusually wet spring for several months. But the nature of the rain that has dogged the tournament has also been unusual, with Melbourne being doused in drizzle for most of the last four days. \u201cWe tend to get more stop-start showers, potentially a bit more thunderstormy, rather than constant rainfall,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cThat\u2019s more a feature of the tropical moisture being dragged down over Victoria. It\u2019s something you would more commonly see over Queensland where there\u2019s moisture in the air. We tend to have a drier climate, and it\u2019s unusual to get the tropical moisture coming this far south.\u201d There is some frustration in the fact that about three kilometres from the MCG there is a 53,000-capacity venue that regularly hosts cricket and has a retractable roof, but the Marvel Stadium has stood empty while the rain falls. \u201cYou can\u2019t predict the weather,\u201d said the Australia coach, Andrew McDonald, \u201cbut what you do know is that when it\u2019s England v Australia there\u2019s no better place to be playing than the MCG.\u201d"

Congratulations to Croatia, who will face either Argentina or the Netherlands in the semi-finals: let Rob Smyth be your MBM guide for that one. Commiserations to Brazil, who will always have Stockholm, Santiago, Mexico City, Pasadena and Yokohama. Thanks for reading this MBM.      6.07pm    A quick reminder to subscribe to our daily football email: Football Daily. Here\u2019s a snippet of the flippant nonsense you missed earlier.  The Netherlands stand between Lionel Messi and a semi-final showdown with Croatia. (We\u2019re pretty sure Brazil will at some point implode under the pressure of being Brazil, so why not on Friday afternoon.)    Updated at 6.08pm GMT    6.06pm    Post-match mailbag. \u201cC\u2019mon Croatia our boys have been great and deserve to go through. Our keeper is a champion. I\u2019m especially proud of him and the rest of the boys. Croatia were outclassed by Neymar, but the equaliser was inevitable. We did it!\u201d \u2013 Kat Stolica \u201cAs a Croatian, obviously I can\u2019t be happier! But, the bigger point is: almost inevitably, people perennially underestimate us. Well, by now they should know better! Kind regards from jubilant Croatia!\u201d \u2013 Tino Andic \u201cPoor match management from Brazil. How do you get caught so badly on a counter attack when you are leading with a couple of minutes to go?\u201d \u2013 Michael Hayen \u201cNeymar scores the best goal of the tournament and 40 minutes later he is out! A big loss for the tournament\u201d \u2013 Philip Murphy \u201cBrazil deserve to go home. Give them a medal for dancing\u201d \u2013 Jeff Sachs \u201cRoy Keane is going to be insufferable isn\u2019t he?\u201d \u2013 Zafar Sobhan \u201cFrederick Freaking Forsyth. Wow. Whew\u201d \u2013 Eric Peterson (second-half kick-off)  Updated at 6.17pm GMT    5.58pm    There seems to be a general sense of disbelief in the stadium. Many of the Brazil fans remain in situ, perhaps to sportingly congratulate Croatia as the delighted victors pose with their flag for a squad photo. Or maybe they\u2019re just in shock. Brazil surely thought they\u2019d made it to the semis, with Neymar and Antony doing the professional thing in running the clock down. But then, with Fred preparing to break through the Croatian back line, Jo\u0161ko Gvardiol made a crunching tackle, Luka Modric sent his team off on one last counter \u2026 and here we all are. What a World Cup story this is! One for the ages \u2026 but one that could take Brazil some getting over. Neymar is in floods. Absolutely stricken with grief. He crumples to the floor and it takes Thiago Silva some effort to haul him up and into his arms. It\u2019s lovely to watch Croatia celebrate; it\u2019s not so easy watching Brazil come to terms with what\u2019s happened.     5.53pm    Croatia cavort in delight! They\u2019ve done a number on the pre-tournament favourites. Luka Modric smiles beatifically. Neymar stares at a point approximately one thousand yards into the distance. What a goal he scored! One that so nearly took his country one step closer to that elusive sixth title! But Brazil will have to wait at least another four years to slake a thirst that stretches back to 2002. The Education City Stadium in Al Rayyan falls quiet, the Croatian fans apart. The majority within had wanted Brazil to win \u2026 but they haven\u2019t got their way. On the BBC, Mark Chapman observes that the \u201cair has gone out of this stadium big time.\u201d A lot of footage of Brazilian fans in tears. You\u2019ll be seeing that replayed over and over again for the next four years at least.   Updated at 6.00pm GMT    5.48pm   RESULT: Croatia 1-1 Brazil (Croatia win 4-2 on pens)  \u2026 and Neymar didn\u2019t even get to take a penalty. The 2018 runners-up make the last four again! Brazil fall to European opposition again!   Updated at 5.54pm GMT    5.47pm    PENALTIES: Croatia 4-2 Brazil. Marquinhos slams his penalty off the base of the left-hand post, and Croatia are through to the semi-finals again! Brazil are out!     5.46pm    Marquinhos must score to keep Brazil in the competition. He steps up, and \u2026     5.46pm    PENALTIES: Croatia 4-2 Brazil. Orsic fires a forensic penalty into the bottom left. Alisson went the correct way, but again couldn\u2019t reach a perfectly placed effort!     5.45pm    PENALTIES: Croatia 3-2 Brazil. Pedro walks up, and he doesn\u2019t look confident. But he is! He stutters, sends Livakovic to the right, and clips into the left. This is just his fourth cap!     5.44pm    PENALTIES: Croatia 3-1 Brazil. Modric strokes a lovely penalty into the bottom left, sending Alisson the wrong way.     5.44pm    PENALTIES: Croatia 2-1 Brazil. Huge pressure on Casemiro \u2026 who belts an unstoppable penalty into the bottom left. Livakovic goes the right way, but can\u2019t get anywhere near it, as the ball ripples the inside side netting.     5.43pm    PENALTIES: Croatia 2-0 Brazil. Majer slams down the middle, sending Alisson to his right.     5.42pm    PENALTIES: Croatia 1-0 Brazil. Rodrygo takes an elongated run-up, and hits a poor effort towards the bottom right. Livakovic saves!     5.41pm    PENALTIES: Croatia 1-0 Brazil. Vlasic up first. He sends it down the middle, into the roof of the net.     5.40pm    The captains Thiago Silva and Luka Modric embrace at the coin toss. Then Modric wins it. He opts for Croatia to take first. The penalties will be taken in front of the Brazil fans.     5.38pm    Brazil looked like they were heading into the semi-finals thanks to Neymar\u2019s quite sensational goal. But Croatia never know when they\u2019re beaten, and Bruno Petkovic\u2019s late equaliser keeps the 2018 runners-up in the 2022 tournament. It\u2019s no more than they deserve for their contribution to an always-enthralling match, and a particularly entertaining period of extra time. Penalties ahoy! More drama for certain!      5.36pm   EXTRA TIME, FULL TIME: Croatia 1-1 Brazil  To paraphrase Sir Alex Ferguson: Croatia, eh? Bloody hell!   Updated at 5.40pm GMT    5.35pm    ET 30 min +2: Neymar loops the free kick into the mixer. Some head tennis. The ball drops to Casemiro on the left-hand corner of the six-yard box. What a chance! Casemiro shoots \u2026 but the ever-heroic Livakovic parries!     5.34pm    ET 30 min +1: Antony dribbles down the right. He checks back and is cleaned out by Perisic. One last free kick. One last chance for Brazil to nick it. Everyone into the Croatia box!     5.33pm    ET 30 min: Majer sends a long-distance rake well wide left of Alisson\u2019s goal. There will be two more minutes.     5.33pm    ET 29 min: Neymar fouls Lovren in the centre circle. Modric looks to take the free kick quickly but is whistled back by the referee. Penalties loom now \u2026 unless somebody can find something really dramatic?     5.32pm    ET 28 min: Petkovic is booked for removing his shirt in the throes of ecstasy. He\u2019ll care not one jot, I\u2019ll be bound!     5.31pm   GOAL! Croatia 1-1 Brazil (Petkovic 117)  Orsic tears down the left, sent into space by Modric. He reaches the edge of the Brazil box and rolls infield for Petkovic, who shoots first time. A slight deflection sends the ball whistling into the bottom left! Alisson can\u2019t get there in time!    Updated at 5.36pm GMT    5.29pm    ET 26 min: Gvardiol\u2019s loose ball looks like letting Fred scamper clear down the inside-right channel, but the young defender recovers with a sensational tackle. And what an important tackle it is, because \u2026     5.28pm    ET 25 min: Neymar and Antony play it short, then the former draws a clumsy foul from Petkovic. Brazil are more than happy with this bitty state of affairs. The clock ticks on.     5.27pm    ET 24 min: Brozovic makes way for Orsic. When play restarts, the always-on Antony wins a corner off Majer down the right.     5.26pm    ET 23 min: Perisic drops a shoulder and knocks the ball past Antony down the left, but can\u2019t win the resulting footrace. Antony holds his line and ushers the ball out for a goal kick.      5.24pm    ET 21 min: Lovren crosses from a deep position on the right. He swings in a good one, and Budimir attacks it, but Thiago Silva rises highest to head clear.     5.23pm    ET 20 min: Before the corner can be taken, Budimir replaces Sosa, who have to go for broke now. Nothing comes of the set piece.     5.23pm    ET 19 min: Perisic whips in a cross from the left. Nobody in chequerboard can connect. Neymar tries to launch a counter but brings down Gvardiol. Croatia come back at Brazil, Modric sending Fred off for the paper and a pack of fags with an outrageous change-of-direction dummy down the left that wins a corner.     5.21pm    ET 17 min: Probably worth pointing out that Brazil were too busy pogoing in sheer delight at Neymar\u2019s goal to break out the choreographed dance moves. \u201cInteresting to see Neymar\u2019s celebration after scoring there!\u201d writes Billy Ditchburn. \u201cActually looked like a spontaneous expression of joy and relief, and not a prerecorded snippet of self congratulatory smugness.\u201d     5.19pm    Croatia get the second period of extra time underway. They\u2019ve replaced Kovacic with Majer, while Brazil switch out Eder Militao and Paqueta with Alex Sandro and Fred.     5.18pm    That was one hell of a goal by Neymar! Never mind dropping deep to start the move. Never mind executing two one-twos en route to breaking into the box. What about that finish, straining every sinew to brush off Sosa, rounding the keeper Livakovic, and having the presence of mind to lift his shot, with Sosa sliding along the line in a desperate attempt to block. Wow!     5.15pm   EXTRA TIME, HALF TIME: Croatia 0-1 Brazil  Not a bad time to equal Pele\u2019s all-time record for the Sele\u00e7\u00e3o, huh? That\u2019s number 77 for Neymar, and one of the most important.   Updated at 5.22pm GMT    5.14pm   GOAL! Croatia 0-1 Brazil (Neymar 105+1)  Brazil suddenly spark into life just as half time in extra time looms! Neymar drops deep, exchanges passes with Rodrygo and Pedro, then powers into the box, rounding Livakovic on the right and absolutely roofing home from a tight angle!    Updated at 5.18pm GMT    5.12pm    ET 15 min: Rodrygo jigs in from the left and lays off to Danilo, who flays a dismal long-range effort many miles over the bar, and wide to boot. A slight hint of desperation from the tournament favourites there.   Updated at 5.14pm GMT    5.11pm    ET 13 min: Kovacic dribbles hard down the inside-left channel but runs into a cul-de-sac. Brazil attempt to counter, but Neymar is tackled by Lovren. Crunch! Modric sends Croatia off on the counter-counter, and Petkovic dribbles into the box from the left. He rolls across to Brozovic, teeing him up on the edge of the D. A huge chance \u2026 but Brozovic blazes wildly over the bar!     5.08pm    ET 11 min: Casemiro crosses from the right. Pedro, on the penalty spot, attempts the spectacular overhead kick, but slips midway through execution. Livakovic gathers.   Updated at 5.10pm GMT    5.06pm    ET 9 min: Rodrygo curls in from the left. Paqueta looks to meet it, sliding in at the far post, but he can\u2019t get ahead of Sosa, who ushers the ball out for a goal kick.     5.05pm    ET 8 min: Modric nutmegs Pedro out on the right. Or maybe he dinked the ball around him cutely. Either way, lovely skill from Croatia\u2019s star turn. He\u2019s 37!     5.03pm    ET 6 min: Danilo crosses from the left. Sosa heads clear. Brazil are pressing forward but there\u2019s no way through.     5.02pm    ET 5 min: He\u2019s happy to let Neymar get away with a couple of frustrated swipes at Brozovic, too. Michael Oliver in a very laissez-faire mood.     5.02pm    ET 4 min: Antony\u2019s really not happy now, as he knocks the ball past Sosa only to be crudely bodychecked. The referee is happy to let things slide.     5.01pm    ET 3 min: Thankfully things don\u2019t look too bad for Paqueta, and he\u2019s up and running again. Then Antony cops one in the face from Sosa \u2013 a finger hooks the side of his mouth in the angling style \u2013 but he doesn\u2019t even get a free kick. He\u2019s not happy.     4.59pm    ET 2 min: Danilo launches a long ball down the right, forcing Sosa, pressured by Antony, to head behind for a corner. Neymar takes, and Pedro connects, but his header is weak and wafts out on the left. Paqueta tries to keep the ball in play, and rolls his ankle, or twists his knee, as he fails to complete his task. He\u2019s down getting a spot of treatment.     4.57pm    Brazil get the first period of extra time underway. No changes.     4.56pm    As the teams regroup and wait for extra time, Neymar sits down. Marquinhos hauls him back to his feet unceremoniously. Shades of Alf Ramsey, who didn\u2019t allow his England players to sit down after 90 minutes of the 1966 final, in order to show the prone West Germany they weren\u2019t as tired. Even if they were. And people say Alex Ferguson invented mind games.     4.52pm   FULL TIME: Croatia 0-0 Brazil  \u2026 and that\u2019s that. Extra time it is!   Updated at 4.53pm GMT    4.52pm    90 min +4: Antony dribbles in from the right and sends a weak effort towards the bottom right. Easy for Livakovic.     4.51pm    90 min +3: Rodrygo attempts to launch an attack and is cynically clipped by Modric, who is extremely fortunate to escape a booking. Had he been yellow carded, he\u2019d miss the semi-final should Croatia make it.     4.50pm    90 min +2: Antony tries to burst into space down the inside-right channel. He accidentally handles and Croatia take their sweet time over the resulting free kick. They\u2019ll be more than happy to take this to extra time.     4.49pm    90 min +1: Rodrygo\u2019s presence forces Livakovic into the concession of another corner. Croatia clear it with ease.      4.48pm    90 min: There will be four added minutes.     4.48pm    89 min: Rodrygo drives down the left but can\u2019t get past Juranovic. Same old story. \u201cCeltic\u2019s Champions League campaign might not have been the most glorious but apparently it enabled Juranovic to study Vicinius Jnr and determine his weaknesses in a manner reminiscent of the Terminator,\u201d writes Gerry Scott. \u201cI did not predict that.\u201d     4.46pm    88 min: Kovacic drops deep and nearly releases Modric down the inside-left channel. Then a low cross finds Petkovic on the edge of the Brazil D, but the substitute striker can\u2019t sort his feet out. Brazilian hearts were in mouths for a nanosecond there!     4.45pm    86 min: Antony works down the right and cuts back for Militao, who whips a low shot wide right from the edge of the box. In fact it\u2019s deflected out for a corner, but nothing comes of that.     4.44pm    85 min: Silva gives Alisson a hospital pass, and the Brazil keeper hacks out for a throw. Nothing comes of the mild panic, but it illustrates the palpable nerves in the stadium as we reach the business end of this quarter final.     4.42pm    84 min: That\u2019s Richarlison\u2019s last contribution. He makes way for Pedro. \u201cCroatia are playing this brilliantly, turning Brazil\u2019s samba stars into a bunch of wallflowers waiting impatiently to be invited onto the dancefloor,\u201d riffs Justin Kavanagh. \u201cIt\u2019s not exactly Friday Night Fever: You Should be Dancing, Brazil; but Croatia are Staying Alive.\u201d     4.40pm    82 min: Rodrygo flashes in a cross from the left. Richarlison eyebrows over the bar from 12 yards. Gvardiol wasn\u2019t letting him get any closer.     4.39pm    80 min: Antony turns on the jets to burn past Sosa on the right. Casemiro arrives to help and crosses deep. Rodrygo cuts back for Paqueta, who batters a low shot from the edge of the box towards the bottom left. Livakovic smothers brilliantly. Any fumble and it\u2019d have been a tap-in for Neymar. \u201cStudents of the Roy Keane School of Samba must be delighted with the absence of rhythm in this match so far,\u201d quips Peter Oh.      4.36pm    78 min: Brazil are attempting to pick up the pace. Richarlison drives at the Croatian back line only to have the ball stolen off his toe by Sosa. He hops around in impotent frustration.     4.35pm    77 min: Marquinhos is booked for wrestling Modric as the Croatian maestro attempts to launch a counter attack. No complaints.     4.34pm    76 min: Rodrygo and Richarlison combine briskly down the inside-left channel before releasing Neymar. Brazil\u2019s biggest star enters the box \u2026 but yet again can\u2019t beat Livakovic, albeit from a tight angle. Great save. Nothing comes of the resulting corner.   Updated at 4.41pm GMT    4.32pm    74 min: Antony cuts in from the right and dives in the environs of Perisic. The referee\u2019s not buying it. Neymar then dribbles down the left wing but can\u2019t diddle his way past the immense Juranovic. Brazil aren\u2019t doing very much at the moment. Croatia will be the far happier side.     4.30pm    72 min: Croatia continue to be patient. Then suddenly Modric creams a pass down the right for Juranovic, who pings infield for Kramaric. His shot is blocked then cleared, and that\u2019s his last act of the evening: he makes way for Petkovic, while Vlasic comes on for Pasalic.     4.28pm    70 min: Croatia slow it down again. They\u2019re flatly refusing to play into Brazil\u2019s hands, South Korea style.     4.26pm    68 min: Casemiro clips the heel of Kramaric and goes into the book. That looked a little bit harsh.     4.24pm    66 min: Lovren and Gvardiol confuse each other on the edge of the Croatia box, allowing Paqueta to nip in between them. Paqueta is suddenly one on one with Livakovic, but yet again the Croatia keeper proves unbeatable. A block for a corner that leads to nothing.   Updated at 4.27pm GMT    4.23pm    65 min: Brozovic tugs Neymar\u2019s shoulder to concede a free kick 30 yards out, just left of centre. That\u2019s his second free kick conceded since picking up a yellow card. He really needs to be careful. One more transgression and he might be for the off. The free kick is wasted.     4.22pm    64 min: Juranovic has been the boss of Vinicius Junior down the Brazil left. On comes Rodrygo to have a go at the Croatia right-back instead.     4.21pm    63 min: Kovacic slips Perisic into a little space down the left. Perisic zings a low cross towards the near post, but there\u2019s nobody in chequerboard taking a gamble. Easy for Alisson.     4.19pm    61 min: Croatia have slowed the game down and it\u2019s causing Brazil and their supporters palpable frustration. \u201cI used to love that game,\u201d writes Fourth Protocol fan Se\u00e1n Connolly. \u201cI played it to death after reading the book. I was super thrilled when they made a film of it. I was a strange 12 year old.\u201d     4.17pm    59 min: Antony powers in from the right and feeds Richarlison, who doesn\u2019t spin quite so elegantly this time. Goal kick.     4.16pm    58 min: Croatia play keep-ball, making Brazil chase.     4.14pm    56 min: Brazil blink and make the game\u2019s first change. Antony comes on for Raphinha.     4.13pm    55 min: Richarlison spins elegantly on a sixpence down the inside-left channel, and out of nothing, Brazil are suddenly dangerously on the attack! He slides Neymar into the box. Neymar strides to the left-hand corner of the six-yard box but can\u2019t force past Livakovic. A good save, though it wasn\u2019t a crisp connection from Neymar.   Updated at 4.18pm GMT    4.12pm    53 min: Juranovic romps down the right again, before switching play to Perisic on the other flank. Perisic curls in from the left, looking for Kramaric in the middle. The cross is too high, and floats out for a goal kick. A few inches lower, though, and Kramaric was surely heading home from six yards.     4.10pm    52 min: Neymar drives down the left and speed. He\u2019s eventually legally skittled to the floor, and stays down for a bit. No need to worry, though, he\u2019s back up soon enough. The crowd enjoyed that run, even if it led to nothing.     4.09pm    50 min: The ever-busy Juranovic wins a corner down the right. Modric floats it in. It drops to Perisic on the left-hand corner of the six-yard box. Alisson blocks, then the flag goes up for offside. It\u2019s been a fast start to the second half by both sides!     4.08pm    49 min: \u2026 but there\u2019s a VAR check for a possible penalty. The ball hit Juranovic on the arm as it dropped over his shoulder, earlier in the move that led to Neymar\u2019s chance. But he knew nothing about it, and the officials aren\u2019t interested in pursuing the matter any further.   Updated at 4.10pm GMT    4.07pm    48 min: Brazil come again through Vinicius Jr down the left. His pass finds Neymar, who scuffs a shot from the penalty spot. Gvardiol blocks brilliantly. Lovren hacks a dismal clearance that nearly drops to Richarlison, but the flag goes up for offside.     4.06pm    47 min: Raphinha scampers with purpose down the right. He reaches the byline and crosses low. With yellow shirts around, Gvardiol deflects the ball towards his own net. Livakovic sticks out a leg to block. That\u2019s one hell of a reaction save!  Updated at 4.17pm GMT    4.04pm    46 min: Neymar embarks on a power run down the right; Vinicius Jr scampers after a long pass down the left. Goal kick, but it\u2019s clear Brazil have been ordered to up the tempo a little.     4.03pm    Brazil get the second half underway. No changes. \u201cI\u2018m dating myself with my taste in Cold War literature here,\u201d begins Eric Peterson, \u201cbut that first half was like slogging my way through the first half of a Frederick Forsyth novel. Tons of backstory and technical hoo-hah that\u2019s a real chore, but boy does it pay off with the roller coaster that\u2019s in store for you through the duration of it. Dearly hoping this game plays out like that.\u201d Can\u2019t say I\u2019m au fait with Forsyth\u2019s oeuvre, but I did once play the Fourth Protocol game. Probably not worth sitting through the whole walkthrough, it wasn\u2019t very good. When push came to shove, I preferred Amidar. Anyway, we\u2019ve veered some way off piste here. Back to Qatar!      3.47pm   Who do you support?  Before you reach for the half-time oranges, please consider supporting Guardian journalism like this, for three reasons: \u2022 We are independent - no one tells us what we can and can\u2019t publish (and that includes Fifa)\u2022 We rely on readers funding us to keep us independent\u2022 We give you the full picture - the excitement on the pitch and the shame, corruption and injustice off it Support the Guardian from as little as \u00a31 \u2013 it only takes a minute. Thank you.     3.46pm   HALF TIME: Croatia 0-0 Brazil  The 2018 finalists will be much happier than the five-time champions. This is in the balance all right!   Updated at 4.02pm GMT    3.46pm    45 min: There will be just one added minute.     3.44pm    44 min: Sosa finds a little space down the left wing and tries to release Perisic into the Brazil box. Nearly, but Thiago Silva reads the play well and gets to the pass first, ushering both ball and Perisic away from the danger zone.     3.42pm    42 min: Neymar aims the free kick towards the top left. It takes a deflection off the wall but doesn\u2019t wrong-foot Livakovic, who stoops to gather by the bottom left. There wasn\u2019t much conviction in that free kick at all.     3.41pm    41 min: Vinicius Jr skitters down the left wing and is clipped by Brozovic, who is already on a yellow and needs to watch himself here. Just a free kick, beside the left-hand corner of the Croatia box. A very dangerous position.     3.40pm    40 min: Neymar drops deep to quarterback in the Modric style. He flicks a lovely pass down the right channel for Raphinha, who controls carelessly, allowing Kovacic to mop up.     3.38pm    38 min: Brozovic drives dangerously down the inside-left channel, but then finds he doesn\u2019t have any options in the middle, and eventually runs the ball out for a goal kick. If only Mario Mand\u017euki\u0107 was ten years younger.     3.36pm    36 min: It\u2019s 45 percent possession apiece right now, with the ludicrous In Contest on ten percent. What can it mean? Let\u2019s not overthink. It doesn\u2019t matter.   Updated at 3.40pm GMT    3.35pm    35 min: Croatia hog the ball in midfield, Modric dictating terms. The majority in the crowd don\u2019t like it, jeering as they keep possession. The Croatian fans however are loving it, their songs louder than the efforts of their Brazilian counterparts right now.     3.33pm    33 min: Juranovic crosses yet again from the right. Perisic prepares to meet it at the far post, but Alisson comes a long way off his line to flick the ball away from him. Croatia look the more likely at the minute.   Updated at 3.35pm GMT    3.32pm    31 min: Brozovic clips Neymar and goes into the book. Brazil try to take the free kick quickly, but it only leads to Lovren and Richarlison bickering. Perhaps Joe Pearson (2 min) was onto something. Brazil then waste the free kick. They\u2019re a bit ragged.     3.30pm    30 min: Perisic, scorer of one of Croatia\u2019s goals in the 2018 final, zips in from the left wing and looks for the top-right corner of the goal. He finds the top-right corner of the stand behind.     3.29pm    29 min: Neymar floats the free kick towards Paqueta, to the right of the Croatian goal, but his team-mate can do nothing with it. Croatia clear.     3.29pm    28 min: Brozovic clips Vinicius Jr and it\u2019s a free kick for Brazil the best part of 30 yards out. Neymar stands over it, eyes lighting up.     3.27pm    26 min: Modric sticks the free kick into the mixer but Brazil clear and the whistle goes. It could be a long evening for Danilo now, on a booking and up against the sprightly Juranovic, who has caused him plenty of bother already.     3.26pm    25 min: Juranovic strides down the right only to be high-kicked in the face by Danilo! That could easily be a red card, but it\u2019s just a yellow, presumably because Danilo got a slice of the ball. Still, it\u2019s a free kick just to the side of the Brazil box, and Modric prepares to wave his wand.     3.24pm    24 min: The corner is no good. This game hasn\u2019t quite tipped over from Intriguing to Fun yet, but it might not be long.     3.23pm    23 min: Lovren\u2019s poor clearing header finds Raphinha, who tees up Paqueta for a long-distance shot. It\u2019s deflected out for a corner on the right. Raphinha to take.     3.22pm    21 min: Vinicius Junior wriggles in from the left wing. He exchanges a wall pass with Richarlison and opens his body, aiming a curler towards the bottom left. Lovren blocks. Neymar then sends a pea-roller straight at Livakovic. Brazil quickly come again, Neymar unable to release Vinicius Jr down the inside-left channel. Easy for Livakovic. Better from Brazil.   Updated at 3.25pm GMT    3.19pm    19 min: Kovacic cuts in from the left and has a dig from distance. Blocked. Croatia are the better side right now, while Brazil are struggling to make passes in the opposition half stick.     3.17pm    17 min: Brazil pass it around the back, though they\u2019re getting severely hassled by the Croatian press. And there\u2019s Croatia supposedly old and knackered. Meanwhile here\u2019s K\u00e1ri Tulinius, who has a long MBM memory stretching back to the very last entry of this one: \u201cThough your astute prediction at the end of the 2010 World Cup that Brazil would implode in 2014 proved spectacularly true, I think that this year\u2019s team is far less consumed by its own sense of destiny. If they lose today, which they might, it won\u2019t be because they\u2019re so high on their own supply that they stagger around their own box like people thrown out of a nightclub for passing out in the toilet.\u201d     3.16pm    15 min: \u2026 but Brazil don\u2019t clear their heads. Alisson tries to send his team on the counter, but his roll-out to Casemiro puts his mate in bother. Modric nips in, then crosses from the right. Militao heads clear. Brazil aren\u2019t exactly rattled, but they haven\u2019t started well.   Updated at 3.18pm GMT    3.14pm    14 min: Croatia are on top, and now win a corner down the left. Richarlison heads it clear powerfully to allow Brazil to gather themselves.     3.13pm    12 min: Juranovic steams down the inside-right channel before slipping Pasalic into space on the overlap. Pasalic whistles a low cross through the six-yard box. Juranovic, who had continues his run, flashes at fresh air, then so does Perisic. A big chance for both Croatians there.     3.10pm    10 min: Raphinha drops a shoulder to skip past Sosa on the right. He reaches the byline and cuts the ball back \u2026 but he\u2019s run it out of play. Goal kick. Both teams are in a lively mood, and why not, it is the quarter-finals of the World Cup after all.     3.09pm    9 min: Perisic crosses from the left. There\u2019s nobody in the centre to take advantage. But Croatia are having some joy down the wings during these early exchanges.     3.08pm    7 min: Juranovic crosses from a deep position on the right. Perisic competes for a header at the far post, but Militao wins a hard-fought contest, and it\u2019s a free kick for Brazil. Speaking of putting it about, here\u2019s Justin Kavanagh: \u201cSerbia, Switzerland, Cameroon, and South Korea are all solid enough teams in the second tier of world football. But Brazil start to step out against the elite today and we should discover if they belong up there with the greats of 58, 70, and 82. As Roy Keane might say, time to steel-tip those dancing shoes, boys.\u201d   Updated at 3.09pm GMT    3.06pm    5 min: The first shot in anger, and it\u2019s a decent one. Vinicius Junior cuts in from the left and attempts to find a team-mate. His pass rebounds back to him. He opts to shoot instead, curling for the top right. It\u2019s on target, but not hit firmly and an easy claim for Livakovic. Lovren then passes out carelessly from the back, allowing Raphinha to intercept and nearly find Vinicius Junior on the edge of the box. Goal kick.     3.04pm    3 min: Kovacic dribbles down the left and draws a free kick from Casemiro. A chance for Croatia to put one into the box, but Brozovic can\u2019t manage it. Still, there\u2019s an early sign that the 2018 finalists haven\u2019t come here to simply defend.     3.02pm    2 min: Brazil have lost five successive knockout matches at the World Cup against European opposition. Some sort of dramatic early statement wouldn\u2019t go amiss. They don\u2019t make one, though. Speaking of which, here\u2019s Joe Pearson: \u201cSo it\u2019s an ex-Merseyside derby, is it? I guess that means Brazil should prepare to play with ten, after Richarlison gets sent off for leaving a two-footer in on Lovren.\u201d     3.00pm    Croatia get the ball rolling. A reminder that if these guys can\u2019t sort themselves out in 90 minutes, we\u2019ll be going to extra time and possibly penalty kicks. A semi-final against either the Netherlands or Argentina awaits!     2.55pm    The teams are out! Brazil are in their iconic yellow shirts, while Croatia wear their equally distinctive red-and-white checkerboard tops. We\u2019ll be off once anthems have been performed, coins tossed and hands clasped.     2.46pm    A reminder of how these two teams got here \u2026 via the mediums of match report, music and movement.       2.23pm    The result of the match is already in. Ritinha, a shark incarcerated in some aquarium or other in Rio, has reportedly plumped for the contents of a food bottle with a Brazilian flag on it, cocking a snook at the one emblazoned with signifiers of Croatia. Congratulations to Brazil for making the semi-final!  Admittedly this directly contradicts the prediction made by Kent, a gibbon at Zagreb Zoo, who got tucked into the open Croatian food box wafted under his hungry face. What could it all mean? Not sure if any other species were consulted: for the record, Paul the Octopus died in 2010, while Triumph the Insult Comic Dog was unavailable.   Updated at 2.25pm GMT    2.02pm    Croatia make two changes to the starting XI named for the win over Japan. Borna Sosa returns from illness, replacing Borna Barisic, while forward Bruno Petkovic is sacrificed for additional midfield strength in Mario Pasalic. Brazil name an unchanged line-up. First-choice left back Alex Sandro still hasn\u2019t fully recovered from a hip injury and remains on the bench. Danilo will once again move across from right back to stand in, with Eder Militao covering in turn.     1.53pm   The teams  Croatia: Livakovic, Juranovic, Lovren, Gvardiol, Sosa, Modric, Brozovic, Kovacic, Pasalic, Kramaric, Perisic.Subs: Stanisic, Barisic, Erlic, Majer, Grbic, Vlasic, Livaja, Petkovic, Budimir, Orsic, Vida, Ivusic, Sutalo, Sucic, Jakic. Brazil: Alisson, Eder Militao, Marquinhos, Thiago Silva, Danilo, Lucas Paqueta, Casemiro, Raphinha, Neymar, Vinicius Junior, Richarlison.Subs: Alex Sandro, Fred, Weverton, Dani Alves, Fabinho, Bruno Guimaraes, Antony, Rodrygo, Everton Ribeiro, Ederson, Bremer, Pedro, Martinelli. Referee: Michael Oliver (England).     1.30pm   Preamble  Brazil have only met Croatia twice at the World Cup, and it\u2019s not entirely clear what history teaches us. The bottom line is that the Sele\u00e7\u00e3o have won both matches, 1-0 in 2006, 3-1 in the opening match of 2014. But on both occasions the Croatians made the five-time champions work. Kaka\u2019s curler decided the former match, but Dado Prso, Ivan Klasnic, Marko Babic and Igor Tudor all went close; eight years later, hosts Brazil required a controversial second-half penalty for some non-contact Dejan Lovren-near-Fred action to turn a game that looked set for a draw. No definitive answers there \u2026 though Brazil lost their first-ever World Cup game 2-1 to Yugoslavia in 1930, drew 1-1 with them in 1954 and 0-0 in 1974, and beat them 2-0 in a crunch match in 1950, Yugoslav captain Rajko Mitic missing the start after cracking his head open on an exposed girder in the still-half-finished Maracana. Do any of those distant memories of a former way of life help any? Almost certainly not. Perhaps more up-to-date analysis will help us? In the round of 16, Croatia were more resilient than impressive in keeping up with a superior Japan, then holding their nerve better in a penalty shoot-out. Brazil by contrast were juggling the ball around against South Korea like it was the Pel\u00e9-Garrincha era all over again. However look at it another way: Croatia might be a superannuated bunch out for one last hurrah, but they were finalists last time round and know how to grind their way through a tournament. And while Brazil play like Brazil, they also have to be Brazil, with all the concomitant expectation, pressure, weight of history, etc. Hmm. Still nothing definitive. So both teams will, in very different ways, and for very different reasons, fancy their chances this afternoon. Brazil are strong favourites to progress to a semi-final against the Netherlands or Argentina \u2026 but while their attack is flying, Alisson had to make three big saves on Monday night and Croatia may not let them get away with that sort of defensive profligacy again. It\u2019s going to be a whole load of fun watching this unfold, and it could go to extra-time and penalty kicks. Kick off is at 3pm GMT, 6pm at the Education City Stadium in Al Rayyan. \u0627\u0646\u0647 \u064a\u062d\u062f\u062b! It\u2019s on!  "

                    "body": "Some of my greatest regrets in life are things I\u2019ve declined on principle. So in many ways, I\u2019m sorry not to be in Qatar for the World Cup. On reflection, I\u2019d have liked to take a detailed look at the horror show, in situ. I was once extremely close to travelling with Donald Trump\u2019s presidential party and some bad boys of Brexit to Mississippi, where the fash-Wotsit was guest of honour at the opening of a civil rights museum, of all things. Insulting? Disgusting? Grotesque? Obviously. But let me tell you: there would have been plenty to write about. I\u2019d have got 5,000 words out of the plane flight alone.\nFast forward to the present day, then, and I am nearly disappointed not to be seeing one of the great horrors of the sporting/geopolitical age in inglorious technicolour. Then again, how many words are honestly available? It\u2019s possible Fifa has finally contrived to pull off the genuinely unprecedented: a World Cup where, two days out from kick-off, there is only one thing to say about it all.\n\nEven someone as electrifyingly articulate as David Beckham is reduced to promoting Doha by claiming \u201cit\u2019s one of the best spice markets I\u2019ve ever been to\u201d. Surely not better than the Say You\u2019ll Be There video, the spice market where he chose his wife? (And which, coincidentally, was also desert-based.) Unfortunately, the only thing anyone now wants to hear from Beckham is an answer to the question \u201chow much money is enough?\u201d. Some estimates place his Qatar promotional fee at \u00a3150m over 10 years, which is about \u00a312m for every hour he did earning PR points in the queue for the late Queen\u2019s lying-in-state. Cynical? Hey \u2013 it\u2019s not me who\u2019s a self-marketed metrosexual whose family wealth was recently estimated at \u00a3425m, yet who somehow wants even more cash from a regime that imprisons and brutalises gay people.\n\nGiven the choice of addressing this or the modern slavery deaths, I see Gianni Infantino has instead taken refuge in some mad diversity-and-inclusion message. The Fifa president recently released a snippy little open letter to national football associations. \u201cAt Fifa,\u201d this ran, \u201cwe [try not] to hand out moral lessons to the rest of the world.\u201d Very wise. It would be like Charles Bronson drawing himself up to his full height and explaining that at HMP Woodhill, he tries not to hand out moral lessons to the rest of the world.\nThe Fifa boss went on to tell fans to shut up about Qatar and love the World Cup, because: \u201cNo one people or culture or nation is \u2018better\u2019 than any other \u2026 this is also one of the core values of football.\u201d To which the only decent reply is: what are you talking about, you grasping shitmuncher? The entire point of your tournament is for one nation to be better than any other! That is literally what international sport is! And guess what \u2013 the nation that ends up being better at football is not going to be Qatar, who are a) crap and b) treat people like crap.\n\nHonestly, can someone mint a participation medal for Gianni \u2013 preferably one that weighs 250 kilos, to keep him rooted to the spot for the entire tournament, and able only to contemplate the radioactively sarcastic words of its engraving: \u201cWELL DONE FOR TRYING\u201d.\nIf not, we\u2019re going to be subjected to weeks of him offering variants of his recent exhortation: \u201cPlease do not allow football to be dragged into every ideological or political battle that exists!\u201d OMG, likewise? Can YOU stop also allowing it to be? Fifa voted for the two most recent World Cups to go to Russia and Qatar, which is about as nonpolitical and nonideological as things screamed off various European balconies during the first half of the 20th century.\nAnyway: is there anything to love about the imminent World Cup? Certainly not the sensational last-minute beer ban. (Although let\u2019s face it \u2013 serving only Budweiser was already a de facto beer ban.) I\u2019m told the tiny geographic scale offers itinerant fans some \u201clogistical relief\u201d. It takes longer to get from Infantino\u2019s eyebrows to his hairline than it does to travel between the various host cities. And I like the fact that as part of their attempts to create some kind of fan Stasi, the hosts have reportedly paid for some of the England Band to attend. That means that every time you hear arguably the nation\u2019s most annoying sound (including a reversing Securicor vehicle), you\u2019ll forever know that some of its purveyors have shown their arses for coins. Arguably a valuable public service.\nBut, hand on heart, my favourite thing so far is the Qatar World Cup stadium that looks like a vagina. I feel it says everything about what we\u2019re dealing with. Consider this: at no point in the design sign-off process did one of the guys on the organising committee \u2013 and it will have been all guys \u2013 have the balls to say: \u201cLook lads, I might end up taking a lot of stick, but doesn\u2019t this \u2026 doesn\u2019t this look like a vagina?\u201d I mean, come on \u2013 they must have seen one.\nMore to the point, in a country where you can be arrested for being gay, you\u2019d have thought it a social imperative for these men to publicly show an easy familiarity with the intimate parts of the female anatomy. Yet every single one of them appears to have been too fearful of something to say anything, which means that they\u2019ve ended up with THE biggest self-own of a stadium in world sport. And so it is that \u2013 game after game \u2013 \u201cdignitaries\u201d from this vicious, censorious, homicidal, women-hating regime will turn out to sit in a giant fanny. It doesn\u2019t remotely make up for the rest of it, obviously. But I am here for that spectacle, at least.\nMarina Hyde\u2019s World Cup Week will appear each Friday during the tournament"

                    "body": "The Via Manzanares shopping centre in the northern suburb of Pilar outside Buenos Aires is an old-style ring of stores around a modest parking lot that usually services a countryside area dotted with gated communities and polo clubs, in a country that boasts the best polo players in the world.There\u2019s a small supermarket, a bicycle shop, a sushi delivery store, a coffee shop and not much more, except for a sleepy mutt named Canela who\u2019ll amble up for a pat on the head from the shoppers stopping by for a pack of beer, a quick espresso or to order a tray of nigiri.But in recent days its peace has been disturbed by fans not of polo, but of football. A large quantity of kids and adults stood patiently waiting in line outside its sweet shop, desperate to buy \u201cfiguritas\u201d, football player stickers similar to US baseball cards.The object is to fill the traditional Panini World Cup album that is a ritual of almost religious significance that repeats itself every four years in Argentina when the World Cup tournament rolls around. The stickers come in sealed packs and there is no assurance collectors will find the players they need to complete the album. Sold in countries around the world, an English-language version in the UK will cost fans an average of about \u00a3870 to fill.With the Qatar games fast approaching, Argentina has gone into a dizzy whirl that is outdoing by a wide stride any previous sticker furore in a country that breathes, dreams and lives football.\u201cI can\u2019t handle the amount of people wanting stickers,\u201d said the attendant at the Via Manzanares sweet shop early in the week, before having to inform her distraught customers that she had run out of packs on Thursday.Sticker mania has swept over Argentina like a tsunami this year, creating a scarcity on the sticker market that has quite literally become an affair of state.Sweet shops, known here as \u201cquioscos\u201d, have been the traditional outlet for sticker packs, but this year Panini began supplying the stickers to other outlets such as supermarkets and gas stations, provoking howls of protest from sweet shop owners.Trade secretary Mat\u00edas Tombolini was forced to call a meeting with Panini executives and sweet shop representatives to try to solve a scarcity that has led to media-reported threats from some parents to sue Panini because of the anguish the scarcity has been causing their children.\u201cThe meeting has begun to assess the situation of the World Cup figuritas market,\u201d the trade secretary tweeted, offering to \u201cmake our legal and technical teams available to collaborate in the search for possible solutions.\u201dBut with inflation out of control and poverty snapping at the heels of an ever-widening segment of society, the government\u2019s intervention backfired badly. There was a social media uproar against the authorities distracting state resources to solve the stickers problem and the government abruptly suspended its intervention.The hardest sticker to find is that of Argentina\u2019s ace player Lionel Messi, who will reportedly be playing his last World Cup at the Qatar games.  Marc R Stanley, the US ambassador to Argentina, posted an ecstatic Twitter video of himself opening up his sticker packages. \u201cOh holy crap, I got Messi, I can\u2019t believe it. That\u2019s unbelievable. I got Messi! All right, Messi, you\u2019re mine!\u201dApart from Italian-owned Panini allowing the stickers to be sold at other venues than just sweet shops, the scarcity is being blamed on distributors who are reportedly bypassing traditional outlets to sell directly in wholesale amounts to individual buyers, sometimes online.This seems to have led to hoarding by mass buyers who then hawk the stickers on the online shopping site Mercado Libre for up to 10 times their suggested retail price of slightly under one dollar a pack.With inflation heading for 100% this year and the recent assassination attempt on vice-president Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner, which failed when the assailant\u2019s gun failed to fire, perhaps Argentina was in need of some light distraction, and the sticker scarcity seems to fit the bill."

                    "body": "I arrived in Europe with a sore tooth and World Cup fever. I left with a half-completed root canal and the unpleasant memory of shitting myself in a Barcelona club. The holiday had been planned for months: my family\u2019s \u201cboys tour\u201d through Russia for the 2018 World Cup, followed by a wedding in the sunny south of France. I had given myself a month after wisdom teeth removal before travel, expecting that I would have made a full recovery. What I hadn\u2019t counted on was the development of a dry socket \u2013 a horrendously painful condition when the clot that develops after a tooth removal is dislodged, exposing underlying bone and nerves. I was told it would be fine in a few days \u2013 a hilarious lie. Unable to drink booze, I spent the first night in Moscow hazy on codeine, miserably sipping borscht and watching crowds burst into nationalistic cheers. On my second day, I visited a dentist \u2013 the first of six. My then-boyfriend and I spent a sunny morning wandering the streets, helplessly refreshing Google Maps and entering random offices until we found our destination in a near-deserted shopping centre. I gave them $70. They packed my mouth with a medicated gel and gave me a script for drugs. We flew to Kazan, an old city on the banks of the Volga, to watch Australia lose to France. I vomited on the plane, sick from antibiotics and strange painkillers. Our apartment looked like a crime scene but there was a kind dentist a few doors down who I visited a couple of times, showing them a useful screenshot I had saved on my phone which translated from English to Russian. \u201cHello,\u201d it read, \u201cI have a dry socket after wisdom teeth removal. Can you please help me?\u201d The third dentist was in nearby Samara, during the second week of the World Cup. A woman in heels ushered me up four flights of stairs, gazed into my mouth, told me I had \u201cvery bad gum\u201d and gave me a script for painkillers banned in almost every country on Earth. Australia drew with Denmark. We flew to Nice, France. I was ecstatic to leave Russia, where my brother had downed shots of vodka and sung The Horses on pub tables with boozed-up locals while I spent hours Googling \u201cpainful dry socket forever\u201d, more acutely sober than I had ever felt in my life.  The dentist in France was a lovely guy with a charming accent, who didn\u2019t charge and told me it was OK to have a \u201cglass or two\u201d while on antibiotics, which I translated to \u201cget absolutely blind at the wedding\u201d. My then-boyfriend spilled red wine on my white dress, we toasted the bride and drove to Barcelona. I was, frustratingly, still in pain, which led to dentist number five. Dentist #5 wore a confronting red uniform and had a teenage receptionist on crutches. They told me I didn\u2019t have a dry socket, but needed a root canal. An hour later, I had a sheet pinned to my mouth and a dentist chipping gleefully away at my gums while chatting about football, as if I had capacity to reply beyond a vague moan. After weeks of antibiotics, I was more constipated than I\u2019d ever been in my life. But finally being off medication meant I could drink, so I took a laxative and celebrated with a few glasses of champagne. By midnight, I was standing in a club off La Rambla, unaware I had quite literally shat my pants, dancing like nobody was watching. But no longer constipated. We flew to Berlin. Dentist #6. They completed my root canal and cleaned my gums for good measure. It cost several hundred euros, but she gave me her card so I could \u201cvisit her next time I\u2019m in Berlin\u201d.  My trip\u2019s ending was on-brand. Our flight was delayed, which meant we missed our connection home from Munich. I arrived back in Australia just in time to make the dentist on Monday morning."

Tentative hope followed by sofa-leaping delusion, ending with a desolate trudge to the fridge after England get unceremoniously turfed out on penalties. Well, not this time, in the tarnished, politically charged sporting arena of Qatar, with its disregard for human rights and women\u2019s rights, its outlawing of homosexuality and its ill treatment of migrant workers, allegations of corruption and so on. Who feels like tearing open the beer nuts for that? I thought, Just imagine if England won: we\u2019d all be shrugging in the streets. This was proved wrong with huge viewing figures, particularly for the team\u2019s 6-2 victory over Iran. Still, for a thrilling moment, sport stood aside and let integrity score a few \u2013 from the BBC replacing the opening ceremony with Gary Lineker\u2019s courteous but still scathing monologue on the Qatari regime, to the Iran team\u2019s heart-stopping courage in refusing to sing their national anthem (echoing the wave of protests back home sparked by the death of Mahsa Amini). Before long there were reports of Qatar having \u201cbuyer\u2019s remorse\u201d about hosting. As for the OneLove armbands, Germany\u2019s players covered their mouths with their hands for the pre-match photos ahead of their game with Japan on Wednesday to indicate they\u2019d been gagged by Fifa, who threatened sanctions against those teams wearing them. Alex Scott wore hers while standing pitchside for BBC One\u2019s coverage of the England v Iran game. Over on ITV for Wales\u2019s opening match against the USA, Roy Keane chided the England squad for not wearing theirs for their first match. \u201cTake your medicine and then in the next game you move on,\u201d he growled from behind a strong beard. Arguably, nobody should be in Qatar, including well-remunerated ambassador for the country David Beckham, occasionally glimpsed looking as though he wished the sand would swallow him up. On Channel 4, someone who once sang \u201cfootball\u2019s coming home\u201d had other things on his mind. David Baddiel: Jews Don\u2019t Count is the TV version of the comedian\u2019s 2021 book, which asked why, in this era of heightened sensitivities, Jewish people aren\u2019t included in conversations about racism. At first it\u2019s a little alarming when Baddiel appears, suited, in black and white: is he going to Ted talk the book at us? In the event, the documentary is just as well argued, weaving through several tough issues, from Jewish stereotypes (running Hollywood; controlling global finances) to Israel/Palestine (discussed by Baddiel and Miriam Margolyes), from cultural prejudice (an evil wealthy character in a Royal Court play was changed to Jewish from Mexican-American to \u201cavoid giving offence\u201d) to mass denial that antisemitism is a factor, even when synagogues are attacked, and more. Various Jewish celebrities are enlisted along the way. Actor David Schwimmer reveals: \u201cI\u2019ve never felt white. Ever.\u201d Author Dara Horn observes: \u201cThere are people who feel that antisemitism consists of murdering 6 million Jews and anything short of that is no big deal.\u201d Comedian Sarah Silverman wonders: \u201cIf we controlled things, wouldn\u2019t we have better PR?\u201d  Elsewhere, Baddiel visits his old Jewish primary school and finds that the children now have regular security drills. He also faces up to his own racism when, as co-presenter of the BBC\u2019s Fantasy Football League in the 90s, he wore blackface to lampoon footballer Jason Lee. When Baddiel meets Lee at the latter\u2019s AbsoluteLee podcast studio to apologise in person, it\u2019s politely accepted. Well, ish. It\u2019s actually one of the tensest TV moments of the year. It\u2019s a cobwebbed understatement to say I expected much of new Netflix eight-parter Wednesday. If we all have an inner child, then make mine Wednesday Addams, baby-goth queen of the acid one-liner. This is what Netflix is up against: those still in thrall to the \u201ctrue\u201d Wednesday, as flawlessly portrayed by Christina Ricci in 1990s films The Addams Family and Addams Family Values. How could Smallville creators Alfred Gough and Miles Millar top that? The first four episodes are directed by Tim Burton (who knows his way around spooks and kooks), while the terrific Jenna Ortega plays Wednesday. The skinny plaits, icicle stare, rigor mortis posture and monotonic delivery (\u201cSartre said hell is other people. He was my first crush\u201d) are all there as Wednesday sets piranhas on high school swim-team bullies. She\u2019s then sent to the Edgar Allan Poe-inspired Nevermore Academy, basically a Hogwarts for \u201coutcasts\u201d, with Mean Girls noir tribes: Fangs (vampires), Furs (werewolves), Stoners (gorgons) and Scales (sirens).  Nevermore is the alma mater of Wednesday\u2019s mother, Morticia, played somewhat flatly by Catherine Zeta-Jones (think a tranquillised Valley of the Dolls), while Morticia\u2019s all-important spark with husband Gomez (Luis Guzm\u00e1n) is awol. Elsewhere, la Ricci appears as a Nevermore teacher, while Gwendoline Christie is the stooping, Dahl-esque principal. One problem is there\u2019s too much going on: psychic visions, stalking monsters, \u201cnormie\u201d townspeople, pilgrims, witch burning. Now she\u2019s 16, Wednesday is also given admirers (Hunter Doohan and Percy Hynes White), which is where I lost patience. Bore off with the boyfriends! A rare creature such as Wednesday is beyond humanising. Indeed, nicely done though the series is, it adheres too firmly to the teen mystery/romantic quandary template. For this Addams fangirl, it\u2019s a waste of her specialness.  In the opening episode of the new three-part series Agatha Christie: Lucy Worsley on the Mystery Queen (BBC Two), the historian hunts through the author\u2019s early life for clues into her psychology and finds a few: the unconventional family; the spendthrift father; the cut-price Egyptian debutante season; the pharmaceutical know-how gleaned volunteering in hospitals during the first world war; the unsuitable marriage to a pilot beneath her station, who was, Worsley gasps, \u201cincredibly hot\u201d. Once Christie started writing, a publisher said a courtroom scene didn\u2019t work, and thus the fabled drawing room denouement was born. This is great fun for those of us who are Christie aficionados. (You didn\u2019t ask, but my favourite screen Poirot is David Suchet \u2013 naturellement! \u2013 while Miss Marple would be a snoop-off between Joan Hickson and Geraldine McEwan.) Few put a pin through human nature quite like \u201chistory\u2019s greatest detective author\u201d, and \u2013 delving, speculating, prying \u2013 Worsley does her proud.

                    "body": "The Socceroos have given their strongest indication yet that Martin Boyle\u2019s World Cup is in serious jeopardy, flying Marco Tilio to Doha as a potential injury replacement a week before the start of their campaign. Australia\u2019s camp insist Boyle can still overcome the knee injury sustained while playing for Hibernian a fortnight ago, but the Scotland-born winger \u2013 one of his adopted country\u2019s key players \u2013 was absent from training for a second day running on Tuesday evening (Wednesday morning AEDT).  In his place was Tilio, who was not selected in Graham Arnold\u2019s 26-man squad but has been called up on standby in the event Boyle is not ready come the eve of the tournament. Fifa regulations stipulate World Cup teams are allowed to replace an injured or ill player up until 24 hours before their opening match. Australia play France next Tuesday night (6am Wednesday AEDT). Boyle, who has five goals from his 19 caps, has been under a cloud since the end of last month when he hurt his knee during his club\u2019s 3-0 Scottish Premiership win against St Mirren. His Socceroos teammate and Hearts midfielder, Cameron Devlin, clearly articulated the 29-year-old\u2019s importance. \u201cOver the years everyone can see what a big player he is,\u201d Devlin said. \u201cHe does it week in, week out over in Scotland for Hibs. He\u2019s been a massive player for them and takes it into his country, Australia. He\u2019d be a massive loss, but I think it\u2019s just precautionary because we\u2019ve got the first game in a week. But if he wasn\u2019t to play he\u2019d be a massive loss.\u201d Tilio, 21, was a notable omission when Australia\u2019s World Cup squad was announced last week, having been considered on the cusp but lacking in consistent enough form and minutes for Melbourne City to warrant his selection.  At the time the City head coach, Patrick Kisnorbo, said \u201cthe hype\u201d around the precocious forward \u201chasn\u2019t helped\u201d and added: \u201cEvery week we get asked about Marco. It\u2019s only normal that sometimes people listen.\u201d Every Socceroos player is now on the ground in Qatar, after the final few arrived late on Monday night local time \u2013 before Tilio materialised on Tuesday morning. Even with the full complement, Tim Cahill had his boots on again, participating in warmup drills at the $1.3bn Aspire Academy, Australia\u2019s all-inclusive base at which the former striker is chief sports officer. Cahill, while long retired, remains the last Socceroo to score at a World Cup from open play, via a head-turning volley against the Netherlands at Brazil 2014. Devlin, 24, met him for the first time on Monday. \u201cI spoke to him after training yesterday,\u201d Devlin said. \u201cFor someone like me to pick his brain \u2026 to have him here and ask him questions, if I can make myself a better player by listening to him, I\u2019ll take every opportunity to do that. \u201cHe joined in training yesterday so that was pretty cool to be up alongside him with the boots on. Legend for Australian sport, so just to be around him is super surreal.\u201d"

It comes after concerns that too many dead rubbers in the last round of matches could dilute the expanded, 48-team event.\nAlthough Fifa\u2019s official position remains unaltered, multiple sources say there have been \u201cinformal talks\u201d and \u201ccorridor chats\u201d in Doha about the benefits of going with 12 groups of four teams rather than 16 groups of three.\nThat could lead to a 104-game World Cup if the top two in each group, plus the best eight third-placed sides, go through to a 32-team knockout stage \u2013 which is 40 more than will be played at Qatar 2022.\n\nNothing has been decided and stakeholders are expected to talk more formally about a potential switch in the coming months. Any decision would have to be taken next year.\nOne well-placed observer said that if the tournament were extended by a few days to fit in more matches then neither Fifa nor the major sponsors would likely object. They pointed to the vast extra revenue that would be generatedthrough ticket sales and concessions.\nHowever, such a move would risk a conflict with clubs and players\u2019 unions given the sensitivities around the increasingly busy calendar and the likelihood of the best teams having to play eight matches and not seven.\nThere is acknowledgment in the game that three-team groups have severe flaws. One is that it may lead to unofficial deals being struck in the last match if, say, both teams needed a high-scoring draw to go through on goal difference. Similarly, if one team lose the first two matches, the final match of the group would only decide where the other two countries ended up in the knockout stage.\nIf Fifa needed any reminder of how a four-team group format can generate extraordinary tension and chaos it was illustrated in Group D on Wednesday as the Poland v Argentina and Saudi Arabia v Mexico matches went to the wire.\nWhatever happens, the number of World Cup games will rise. The tournament has consisted of 64 matches since the switch to 32 teams in 1998. Increasing it to 48 teams for 2026 will lead to a minimum of 80 games, the figure under a three-group format."

Guardiola and his staff may also have to watch events in Qatar through their hands, clenching as heavy tackles fly in and muscle injuries stack up given City \u2013 with 16 players \u2013 are the Premier League club sending the most players to the finals.\nEven if Erling Haaland will be spending much of the next six weeks on the Etihad Campus, key players such as Kevin De Bruyne, Phil Foden and Rodri will return bearing the physical and mental scars of the tournament. And individual success in Qatar may not necessarily be good news for a player\u2019s club. To take the example of England\u2019s Euro 2020 finalists, a number of Gareth Southgate\u2019s players made indifferent starts to their 2021-22 club campaigns.\n\nSuch are the intangibles for clubs of this World Cup. J\u00fcrgen Klopp is a vocal critic of the tournament being staged in Qatar, particularly in mid\u2011season, but he will see only seven players jet out to pre-tournament training camps. Like Guardiola, Klopp has a star forward getting a needed rest, in Mohamed Salah, but it is Uruguay rather than Liverpool who will be the immediate beneficiaries of Darwin N\u00fa\u00f1ez\u2019s recent flowering.\nOverall the Premier League is providing more World Cup players than any other division, with 134 players at the tournament \u2013 16% \u2013 plying their trade in the English top flight. The league leaders, Arsenal, have 10 players in World Cup squads but their England contingent of three contains two players, Aaron Ramsdale and Ben White, expected to be reserves in Southgate\u2019s squad. The same may go for Gabriel Jesus and Gabriel Martinelli among a Brazil squad featuring heavy competition for forward places. Mikel Arteta appears to be getting off rather lightly, though how to motivate players disappointed at being underused is yet another consideration to add to the pile.\nThe response of players to disappointing tournaments is also important. How, for example, might Antonio Conte coax the best from Harry Kane at Tottenham should England\u2019s captain flop in Qatar? Or, to name another player among Spurs\u2019 11 call-ups, someone carrying a yet heavier burden for his national team, Son Heung\u2011min? Will his disappointing season so far \u2013 and the facial injury he is nursing \u2013 cast a shadow over his World Cup and consequently his return to Tottenham? Every player is on a sliding scale. How might they react to playing in a mid\u2011season tournament in which their country\u2019s expectations are sky\u2011high while playing for a different coach using probably very different tactics?\n\nFor managers such as Graham Potter and Erik ten Hag, relative newcomers to their clubs trying to install a fresh playing doctrine, losing players in mid\u2011season is unhelpful. Manchester United, sending 14, have made significant improvements under Ten Hag, and though Cristiano Ronaldo can be discounted from the list of players whose fitness he will care about, Casemiro, Christian Eriksen and Lisandro Mart\u00ednez have all been crucial to United\u2019s revival. Each is playing for a nation expected to go deep in the tournament.\nPotter\u2019s Chelsea have stalled of late. His players have appeared unresponsive to his tactics. Chelsea will have 12 players in Qatar but a mid\u2011season training camp planned for Abu Dhabi also gives Potter a decent core with which to work. Reece James, Wesley Fofana, Kepa Arrizabalaga, Marc Cucurella, Trevoh Chalobah, Ruben Loftus-Cheek, Jorginho and Pierre\u2011Emerick Aubameyang are among those players not travelling.\n\nManchester United and Chelsea will return to action at Christmas looking at Newcastle in third place, and while Eddie Howe will not welcome a loss of momentum only five players are being lost from his squad to the World Cup, two of them \u2013 Callum Wilson and Nick Pope \u2013 likely to be on the England bench. And while Bruno Guimar\u00e3es is a player Newcastle cannot afford to lose, other leading players from this season in Sven Botman, not picked for Louis van Gaal\u2019s Netherlands team, and Miguel Alm\u00edron, whose Paraguay did not qualify, will return to Tyneside after taking short rests.\nFurther down the table, the World Cup break throws up an opportunity for Nathan Jones, freshly arrived at Southampton, who are sending only two players. Should Bournemouth appoint a new manager \u2013 or Gary O\u2019Neil stay on \u2013 only the Wales pair of Kieffer Moore and Chris Mepham will not be around.\nThree managers ended the season\u2019s first tranche of fixtures under pressure. At West Ham David Moyes will have mixed feelings if England progress deep in the tournament, with Declan Rice a key midfielder. Lucas Paquet\u00e1, the summer\u2019s big signing, is yet to shine in east London but is favoured by the Brazil coach, Tite. Perhaps a good showing in Qatar can energise Paquet\u00e1\u2019s club season. Jesse Marsch will be roaring on Team USA, though in Brenden Aaronson and Tyler Adams he will fear fatigue in two players who have become important to Leeds.\nWhich leaves Frank Lampard, with Everton losing four players to the tournament. Until his mistakes at Bournemouth at the weekend, Jordan Pickford had been exemplary in goal. An injury or the loss of form that can follow for players scapegoated for English failure could mortally wound Everton. Such are the myriad equations the World Cup must turn over in the minds of Premier League managers."

                    "body": "The Gregg Berhalter era began in the desert with a 3-0 friendly win over Panama in January 2019 in front of 9,040 people in Glendale, Arizona. The journey to Qatar has spanned 56 matches: a sometimes thrilling, occasionally dreary trip from the cacti and air-conditioned sprawl of the oblivious Phoenix suburbs to the dense skyscrapers and ignoble stadiums of the peninsula hosting the globe\u2019s highest-profile sporting event. Here, in another arid region known more for sand than soccer, come three or more games that will define Berhalter\u2019s tenure as head coach of the US men\u2019s national team \u2013 and, if things go horribly askew, probably end it. Given the immense scrutiny the Americans will face as co-hosts in 2026, Berhalter cannot afford to acquire a reputation as a tactician who shrinks under the spotlight. But adjudicating what would constitute success or failure in Qatar is tricky since this is a new and green group of players, only one of them \u2013 DeAndre Yedlin \u2013 with prior World Cup finals experience. There is relief that the US made the tournament at all following the 2018 qualifying debacle and a tremulous 2022 campaign that saw Berhalter\u2019s side finish behind Canada and Mexico, securing the third and final automatic place on goal difference on the last day. The man who took the US to the 2014 tournament, J\u00fcrgen Klinsmann, told Sports Illustrated in 2018, \u201cyou build a new skeleton between World Cups\u201d. There\u2019s not much flesh on the bones. But we\u2019re about to learn plenty about the heart, soul and mind of an American generation often touted as the most talented the nation has ever seen. Asked on ESPN about expectations, Berhalter spoke about style rather than results: \u201cI think it\u2019s important that we go over to Qatar and we represent our identity as a team. It\u2019s not time to change who we are. We\u2019re an aggressive team, a high-pressing team, we want to use the ball and we\u2019re going to find out if we can be successful doing it.\u201d Executing the gameplan flawlessly but finishing outside the top two in Group B, which also includes Wales, Iran and England, would not reflect well on the plan. It would also be a below-par outcome. Reaching back to Italia \u201990, the US have reached the knockout stages in four of their past seven finals, including their last two campaigns, in 2010 and 2014. But the only victory after the group phase came in 2002, when Bruce Arena\u2019s side beat Mexico in the round of 16 (and then lost unluckily to Germany in the quarter-finals).  A conclusion in Qatar that\u2019s in line with history and reasonable expectations, then, looks like a battling defeat in the round of 16 with Berhalter able to argue that his squad has banked valuable experience that will serve them well for 2026, when most of his core players should be at their peak. Anything more would be a bonus; anything less a disappointment. But luck will play a role. The group and knockout stages are \u201cliterally two different tournaments,\u201d the 49-year-old said. \u201cAnything can happen on any given day. All you want to do in the knockout tournament is play your best possible game. And if you happen to go out and you play your best possible game, you go out with your head held high.\u201d Still, such an exit would make it harder to assert that the USMNT have made significant progress in the eight years since the 2014 side did their best and lost, reaching the round of 16 but going out to a superior Belgium after extra-time despite the heroics of Tim Howard in goal. By the key metric for casual observers \u2013 how far did you get in the World Cup? \u2013 it would indicate stagnation. The 2022 side is obviously weaker at striker and goalkeeper than 2014, when the US boasted Clint Dempsey and Howard; in other positions it is potentially more dynamic, especially on the flanks. Plenty of the current crop are at large or medium-sized European clubs, but the 2014 vintage had steady veterans such as DaMarcus Beasley, Michael Bradley, Geoff Cameron and Jermaine Jones, who also spent time in major European leagues. \u201cOn paper they are the most talented US men\u2019s national team we\u2019ve ever had,\u201d says the former striker Herculez Gomez, who played for the US in the 2010 World Cup finals and will be in Doha to host a show on ESPN+. Compared to previous generations, \u201cThis team is a lot younger, a lot faster, better in transition, individually better, technically better.\u201d  However, he adds, they lack the veteran knowhow of the 2010 and 2014 sides, which had \u201cguys that were a bit nasty, who played with a chip on their shoulder\u201d and were not daunted by tough assignments away from home.  In 2014 the US sauntered to Brazil, winning the Hex qualification stage with seven victories and one defeat over 10 games for an 11-point cushion over fourth-placed Mexico, who progressed via the inter-confederation playoffs. For the 2022 cycle the US won only once on the road and scored 21 goals in 14 games, most of them close-range tap-ins or simple headers. A typical goal came from the defence failing to clear a cross and an American pouncing on the loose ball. No goals were scored from outside the penalty area and there were only two golazos: a Christian Pulisic pirouette against Panama and a rocket against Costa Rica from Sergi\u00f1o Dest. Aside from age, perhaps the biggest difference from eight years ago is not the calibre of those in the squad but the quality of those who aren\u2019t. The talent pool now is far deeper and there are many more Americans at foreign clubs \u2013 learning each day, as Gomez points out, from some of the planet\u2019s finest coaches. In contrast, most of the 2010 roster spent their late teens playing at American universities. Berhalter had enough options to almost completely reinvent the team. Only four of the players who lost the fateful 2017 qualifier to Trinidad &amp; Tobago are in the squad for Qatar. The coach trialled dozens of up-and-comers in their teens and early 20s, many playing in the top two divisions in leading European countries. He\u2019s used 91 players \u2013 three more than England\u2019s Gareth Southgate, who\u2019s overseen 20 more fixtures. Some of the players Berhalter has used most frequently \u2013 Paul Arriola, Sebastian Lletget, Gyasi Zardes, Reggie Cannon, Zack Steffen \u2013 didn\u2019t even make the final 26.  Other names that Berhalter has discarded or ignored imply the luxury of choice. The teenaged attacking midfielder Julian Green, shockingly named in the 2014 squad by Klinsmann, scored with his first touch against Belgium. Now 27, Green made 24 Bundesliga appearances last season for Greuther F\u00fcrth but no one seriously expected him to be invited to Qatar. He hasn\u2019t made a single appearance under Berhalter. Of the 26 in Qatar, nine are at MLS clubs and the other 17 ply their trade in Europe. But Berhalter (a former MLS player and coach) could easily have picked a comparably gifted roster with only three MLS-based players, Walker Zimmerman, Kellyn Acosta and Jes\u00fas Ferreira. Klinsmann, meanwhile, selected 10 MLS players for his 23-man squad despite his aversion to the league, which he saw as substandard. And the level in MLS has improved since 2014, when there were only 19 teams; this season there were 28. Klinsmann, for all his grand long-term schemes to rebuild the pipeline from top to bottom, was fired when it looked doubtful that the senior team would reach Russia. Given the extreme importance of the World Cup to the profile of American soccer his departure wasn\u2019t surprising. The 2014 group game between the US and Portugal attracted about 25 million viewers on ESPN and Univision. The US\u2019s final warm-up game before Qatar, a goalless draw with Saudi Arabia, drew an audience of 226,000 on FS1. The Black Friday clash with England is a big opportunity to attract attention, though the summer tournament in Brazil became a mainstream cultural moment that will be hard to repeat in 2022 given the early kick-off times for US residents and the alternative temptations of the festive season, with football, basketball and hockey in full swing. Still, there are gains that can\u2019t be as easily measured as viewing figures or the results of a month-long tournament. Some are Klinsmann\u2019s legacy: intensive recruitment of dual nationals, the conviction that the US should adopt a more complex and attractive style, an emphasis on youth development, and encouraging players to move to Europe. In 2014 there were growing pains. Klinsmann deployed criticism as motivation but it was sometimes hard to tell whether he was being demanding or demeaning. One New York Times headline read: How Jurgen Klinsmann Plans to Make US Soccer Better (and Less American). The vision was bright but blurry. When Berhalter talks about his team\u2019s identity he\u2019s discussing tactics, not inviting agonised introspection about what it means to be an American soccer player. Eight years on from the US\u2019s last World Cup finals there is a stronger domestic league and a deeper well of global talent. Tactical debates, not an identity crisis. A coach not a psychodramatist. And the promise of greater things in three-and-a-half years\u2019 time. It would be optimistic to expect the US to take a giant step forward in Qatar but there is little doubt the path leads upwards."

                    "body": "  6.15pm    On which note, I will take my leave because Andy Hunter\u2019s match report is with us. Thanks all for your company and comments \u2013 sorry I couldn\u2019t use them all \u2013 and enjoy the second game. Peace out.       6.12pm    \u201cYou raise a most interesting \u2013 if not, under the circumstances, particularly urgent - point re the concept of something being \u2018nondescript\u2019,\u201d says Andrew McGuire. \u201cHowever, as the \u2018thing\u2019 in this case was a ball, which by definition is round, the question appears almost as moot as it is irrelevant to the match on which you are purportedly reporting. I nevertheless wonder how many of the minimum of ten forthcoming penalty kicks will be described in a fashion that gives the reader a sense of their \u2018penalty-kick-ness\u2019 or quiddity.\u201d Not so, I don\u2019t think \u2013 I was describing a pass, for which \u201cball\u201d is a synonym, not the actual sphere which is, as you intimate, spherical.      6.10pm    \u201cHeart broken,\u201d says Krishna Moorthy. \u201cOn the flip side, all this for only getting skinned alive by Brazil.\u201d Better than getting skinned alive by Boris, of Wind-Up Bird fame, I guess. But I can\u2019t quite agree otherwise, because the way I see it, it\u2019s all this for a moment like that at the end. When Croatians look back at this time \u2013 when they inculcate it in their children and grandchildren \u2013 it\u2019ll be the feeling of victory, and the excitement through the stretch that sustains.      6.07pm    \u201cIt\u2019s 3am and my son is in tears,\u201d says Robert Turner. \u201cFootball what a beautiful but cruel game.\u201d  I feel like I say this all the time, but there\u2019s nothing even remotely like it \u2013 which is this competition is where it is, but also why it provokes emotions and reactions in us that nothing else can.      6.04pm    Is Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 good? Nick Ames has the answer \u2013 and many others, here:      6.02pm    On the subject of female Japanese writers, Joseph Trivers returns: \u201cFumiko Enchi should be read. She is amazing.\u201d I am bookmarking the arse out of this MBM, and please be very sure it\u2019s nothing to do with anything I\u2019ve contributed to it. I want to drop tons on books this very second.      6.00pm    \u201cOnly *slightly* different stakes but my brother was a set-piece specialist for our all-conquering under 9s league back in the 90s,\u201d says Casiano Martinez. \u201cHe would claim side-footing gives you a better inside whip and is harder for the keeper to read your run, but he\u2019s also left-footed and as we all know they\u2019re just magic.\u201d I\u2019d not worry too much about the keeper \u2013 hit it properly, and they can\u2019t do anything.      5.57pm    ANDITDONTSTOP! We\u2019ve barely finished hither and we\u2019re going yon! Stick with me while we calm ourselves down, but also join Scott Murray for Brazil v South Korea!       5.56pm    James Hopkin emails with some Japanese women we should read: \u201cSayaka Murata, Yu Miri, Banana Yoshimoto, Yoko Ogawa. Here\u2019s a handy ready-reckoner.\u201d And he also recommends Tilted Axis Press, who try to bring Asian writers to English translation.\u201d      5.53pm    \u201cI think nondescript is a placeholder for a description that is unforthcoming,\u201d says Sean Bennett. \u201cMuch in the same way the words dark matter are used as a placeholder for a description of whatever dark matter in fact is. So it isn\u2019t paradoxical. Or it is. Hope that clears that up.\u201d That\u2019s why we\u2019re here!     5.53pm    As for Croatia, here\u2019s often a team that doesn\u2019t impress but still does well, and so far, that\u2019s them. They meet Brazil or South Korea next, and it\u2019s hard to see them going any further if the favourites progress.      5.51pm    Goodness me, I\u2019ve just realised I\u2019m half-standing and that my palms are leaking. Association football!     5.50pm    Looking again, the second Livakovic save \u2013 from Mitoma \u2013 is a really brilliant effort. He extends an arm to claw free of the line and somehow sends the ball the other way.      5.49pm    I\u2019m just a moron with a keyboard, but I\u2019ll never quite get why, if you\u2019re going low, you don\u2019t hit a penalty with your laces. Because if you use the side, don\u2019t hit the side-netting, and the keeper guesses right, it\u2019s getting saved.      5.47pm    Oh man, I can\u2019t lie, I was kind of looking forward to the crying, but seeing these Japan lads in tears has broken me. I\u2019ve absolutely adored their work, and they deserve all of our affection and respect.      5.46pm    Absolute heartbreak for Japan, who\u2019ve put so so much, not just into this game but into this competition! But \u2013 and I despise saying this \u2013 they froze in the shootout, while Livakovic grew! He saved three kicks, and is a national hero! What a feeling for him! He\u2019ll never, ever feel like this again as long as he lives!   Updated at 5.48pm GMT    5.44pm   Croatia beat Japan 3-1 on penalties!  Pasalic keeps calm, finds the bottom left, and Croatia are into the last eight!   Updated at 5.47pm GMT    5.44pm   Japan 1-2 Croatia  Yoshida goes left \u2026 and Livakovic reads it, saving easily again! Japan\u2019s misses have all been so weak! Croatia can win it now\u2026.     5.43pm   Japan 1-2 Croatia  Livaja ambles up, pauses, looks up, an taps against the post like Gonda\u2019s gone the wrong way!   Updated at 5.46pm GMT    5.42pm   Japan 1-2 Croatia  Asano scores easily, Livakovic going left as he goes right.      5.42pm   Japan 0-2 Croatia  Gonda goes to his right and Brozovic clips down the middle! If Japan don\u2019t score this one, Croatia can win next go!      5.41pm   Japan 0-1 Croatia  Livakovic saves again! Mitoma goes low but not in the corner, and the keeper saves to his right this time!      5.41pm   Japan 0-1 Croatia  Vlasic sweeps home!     5.40pm   Japan 0-0 Croatia  A miserable effort from Minamino, Livakovic saving low to his left without having to go very far.   Updated at 5.42pm GMT    5.40pm    It\u2019s Minamino to kick, and when you see the angle from behind him, the goal looks very small and Livakovic looks very big\u2026     5.39pm    Japan to go first, and at their end; the ref tells the keepers what he expects from them.     5.38pm    Gonda, though, seems to me like the kind of confident, athletic keeper who saves penalties.   Updated at 5.41pm GMT    5.37pm    I guess Croatia have the experience, but that means they also have the fear. Or in other words, I\u2019ve not a clue what\u2019s going to happen next.      5.35pm   Full-time in extra time: Japan 1-1 Croatia  It\u2019s lottery time!     5.35pm    120 min Anyone know what the Japanese fans are singing? But excuse me whole I interrupt myself, Brozovic powering into the box from the left and seeing his shot blocked by Tomiyasu! And Croatia keep at it, Majer collecting the ball outside the box, taking a touch, and seeing the celebration and headline! He\u2019s got a clear sight of goal! He can be the hero! But he can only shoot a yard or two wide of the near post!      5.33pm    119 min Croatia win a free-kick down the left which Barisic pumps into Tanaka. He wears it pretty well, going down but refusing treatment in favour of a moment; we\u2019re almost done.      5.32pm    118 min Brozovic, who\u2019s been disappointing, dinks a nondescript ball into the box \u2013 is nondescript a philosophical paradox, given by deploying it, we\u2019ve disproved the point it\u2019s trying to make? \u2013 and Yoshida, who\u2019s been excellent clears.      5.31pm    117 min Japan have never reached the last eight of the World Cup. They\u2019re about to endure, and perhaps enjoy, the most important few minutes in their country\u2019s football history.      5.30pm    116 min Barisic loses possession to Ito, scythes him down, and as soon as he\u2019s stretched out his cramp, he\u2019s booked.      5.29pm    115 min Now Japan counter, and Sakai has a chance to cross \u2026 but scuffs his effort and Croatia clear the box. But then Tanaka finds Endo in a nice position down the right and he crosses, but Mitoma opts to go for goal instead of knocking back across, and Livakovic collects well.      5.27pm    114 min Mitoma thinks he\u2019s letting the ball out, and Pasalic somehow sneaks up on him to win a throw. Again, here comes Juranovic to luzz into the box \u2026 but again, out comes Gonda to claim confidently.      5.26pm    113 min Croatia are having a good couple of minutes and win a thrown down the right which Juranovic hurls at Pasalic, who gets a flick, and underneath it we enjoy the unusual spectacle of a cowering defender, Sakai doing what we\u2019d all do, but to allow Gonda to rush out and hold.      5.25pm    112 min \u2026but Gonda rushes out to double-fist clear. He\u2019s been solid tonight.      5.24pm    111 min Majer nashes down the right and crosses; Japan don\u2019t get the ball clear, and Croatia have a corner, so here come the big men\u2026     5.24pm    110 min Both sides are absolutely bushed, but it\u2019s Japan who look fresher now, Mitoma again holding the width before trying to move inside and giving the ball away.      5.22pm    109 min And here he is now, collecting a square pass from Tanaka down the left, but his cross is poor and Croatia get it away.  Updated at 5.23pm GMT    5.21pm    108 min Mitoma robs Pasalic and nips down the left, but running out of space, he passes infield and backwards. He looks the likeliest gamebreaker.  Updated at 5.23pm GMT    5.20pm    107 min Those changes removing likely penalty-takers, suggest both sides would like to get this done in the next 15 minutes.  Updated at 5.23pm GMT    5.20pm    106 min We go again!  Updated at 5.23pm GMT    5.19pm    Change for Japan: Tanaka replaces Morita. And two changes for Croatia: Livaja and Orsic for Budimir and Perisic.      5.17pm   Half-time in extra time: Japan 1-1 Croatia  Both sides are trying to win this, but neither has much left nor anyone they can rely on to score. But the nerves are getting right on top, and when that happens, who knows?   Updated at 5.19pm GMT    5.16pm    105+2 min These last few minutes have been better.     5.15pm    105+1 min We\u2019ll have two added minutes.      5.15pm    105 min They\u2019ve been quiet in extra time but Japan spring, Mitoma collecting possession in his own half and attacking the inside-left channel before, suddenly, he sees a space inside so his attacks it and unleashes a powerful shot \u2026 that\u2019s straight at Livakovic, who beats away! Japan maintain pressure, but when the ball comes back, Tomiyasu, waiting ages for it to drop, can\u2019t think of anything goof to do when it does and though a corner eventuates, it comes to nowt.      5.12pm    103 min Aaaarrrggghhh! A poor header backwards from Mitoma has his hands covering his swede immediately, but Asano is on-hand to clear up his mess before Pasalic can pounce.  Updated at 5.15pm GMT    5.11pm    103 min Endo wins possession in midfield and sticks a ball in behind Gvardiol for Asano. Yeah, good luck getting that, old mate.  Updated at 5.15pm GMT    5.10pm    101 min Croatia win a throw dow the right and when it\u2019s hurled in Budomic gets flick, but it won\u2019t arrive at Budomir quickly enough, Sakai and Asano sliding in to block.      5.09pm    100 min As is often the case with extra time, the tension is greater than the quality, so the director cuts to Vida sticking an arm around both Kovacic and Modric, creating what looks like the world\u2019s most fearsome football-monster.   Updated at 5.12pm GMT    5.08pm    98 min Changes for Croatia and might this be the last we see of the wonderful Luka Modric on the world stage? He departs \u2013 Kovacic too \u2013 with Majer and Vlasic arriving.      5.06pm    96 min \u201cHas no one mentioned Scabby Queen yet?\u201d You know, same as Old Maid but the loser then has to cut the deck and receive be rapped over the knuckles with a pack of cards the resulting number of times? From memory, views were mixed on whether you had to stop when blood was drawn.\u201d Never! But we did slaps and scrapes: you cut, and if it was black you got rapped, but if it was red you had the deck dragged from on top of the knuckles, over them and down. This was, in my experience, far more likely to cause claret.      5.04pm    95 min Asano chases a ball to the line and it goes behind; the ref gives a corner, and Kovacic is enraged; if Japan score from this, there\u2019ll be allsorts. But eeeeesh, the ball comes in, Tomiyasu heads Pasalic \u2013 he\u2019ll need a spot of treatment \u2013 and the whistle goes for a foul.      5.02pm    94 min Brozovic is caught upfield and Mitoma attacks the space, seeking Asano with a low cross \u2026 and Asano gives it the overs, but no one is behind him so Croatia clear.  Updated at 5.03pm GMT    5.01pm    92 min A near-post cross is the answer, Taniguchi diving but unable to wrap head around ball and send across goal, so instead thunking wide.      5.00pm    91 min \u201cWatching from Japan,\u201d tweets @tensaimon, \u201c30+ minutes less sleep, though is there really any point going in for nine o\u2019clock, none of my students will be coming to class....\u201d That seems like a win all round. Meantime, Japan force a corner down the right; what will Ito come up with this time?  Updated at 5.01pm GMT    4.59pm    91 min We go again. Ah man, I love extra time.      4.58pm    Japan look the likelier winners to me, but if I was betting, I\u2019d back penalties. Neither side has a reliable goalscorer and chances have been in short supply since Croatia equalised.   Updated at 5.01pm GMT    4.54pm   Full-time: Japan 1-1 Croatia  That got a bit scratchy towards the end, but we\u2019ll now have another 30 minutes of glorious World Cup FootballTM and there\u2019s nothing wrong with that.  Updated at 4.57pm GMT    4.53pm    90+3 min It\u2019s Japan looking likelier to force a winner, Minamino winning a throw off Modric. But Japan don\u2019t stick the ball into the box, and that will be that.      4.52pm    90+2 min Excellent from Kovacic, hunting down Asano to outmuscle him down the line and set Croatia away \u2026 but then Perisic can\u2019t collects a pass from Gvardiol.      4.50pm    90 min We\u2019ll have four added minutes, before 30 extra minutes. And rightly so: we deserve, nay demand, more football.      4.49pm    90 min Mitoma thinks he\u2019s found a yard in midfield but Gvardiol immediately relieves him of it and when Croatia attack, Kovacic somehow takes out Ito and Budomir with a slide, and he\u2019s booked.      4.48pm    88 min \u201cA neighbourhood favourite was sting pong,\u201d says Sydney Kemme Nash regarding our childhood pastimes chat. \u201cVery similar to the normal game of ping pong but for every point scored the victorious team \u2018won\u201d\u2019the right to slam the ball as hard as they could at the bare backs of their opponents (still from across the table). No one has lasting scars as far as I\u2019m aware.\u201d     4.46pm    87 min Change for Japan, Minamino on for the excellent Doan. He\u2019s my player of the match, for the nothing that\u2019s worth.   Updated at 4.53pm GMT    4.45pm    86 min Kovacic appears, finds Perisic on the left, and the cross is a goodun \u2013 Japan have struggled getting these away second half \u2013 and Pasalic heads wide.      4.44pm    85 min Asano has a run and thinks he can breeze past Gvardiol on the outside, so is now necking a whole pint of Nahman.      4.44pm    84 min \u201cReally excellent game and cannot call who will win,\u201d says Carol McCluskey. \u201cMaeda played as he does for Celtic, giving it his all, unbelievable speed and energy but sometimes his touch is not quite there. In a straight choice between the two of them, I would have chosen Kyogo but both are exciting players. Game could easily go to those whose plates can cope with pressure to score a penalty. Loving the commentary, only gameI have watched live due to this a being Qatar and me being female and queer but have given this bar my money for beer.\u201d I\u2019ve not seen loads of Kyogo, but I\u2019ve seen enough to be surprised he\u2019s not in their best 23 outfielders.      4.42pm    83 min \u201cReference Zafar Soban\u2019s comments on 66 minutes,\u201d begins Tim Howard, \u201cI don\u2019t recall this in the UK but I played this in Ecuador in 2005 so it\u2019s still going strong. The version that we played when I was at school was called Red Arse and involved players aiming penalties at you while you bent over facing away from them.\u201d How does one win such endeavour?      4.41pm    82 min As we suspected at the outset, extra-time looks extremely likely.      4.41pm    80 min Japan win a free-kick out on the right and the delivery is good so Croatia don\u2019t clear properly and a lovely little ball down the side, from Mitoma, finds Tomiyasu inside the box, left-hand side, eight yards from goal! But, well, ohhhhh maaaate! Rather than hit ht, he squares to no one and Croatia clear! Japan are so much more inventive in and around the box, though.      4.38pm    78 min The corner is a goodun too, Pasalic knocking back and down for Barisic, who can feel the sweet, sweet feel of leather on leather \u2026 but Doan, who\u2019s had a great game, slides in to filch the ball away from him!      4.37pm    77 min The World Cup-specialist is coming into this! A poor ball from Yoshida sets Perisic away and he drives through the inside-left channel, unleashing a venomous shot from 20 years that the stretching Tomiyasu deflects behind.      4.35pm    76 min Sakai and Barisic go up together and the latter lands awkwardly, so there\u2019s a brief pause, but he\u2019ll be fine.      4.35pm    75 min Another change for Japan, Sakai replacing Kamada \u2013 who\u2019s had a good game. I\u2019m surprised he\u2019s been withdrawn.      4.34pm    75 min Another ball into the box from Croatia, Juranovic with it this time, but Pasalic can\u2019t make anything of it.   Updated at 4.34pm GMT    4.33pm    73 min The corner goes near post \u2013 Croatia have clearly been working on their set-pieces which makes sense given how hard they\u2019re finding it to score in open play \u2013 but Perisic botches his attempted turn-back to the edge.     4.32pm    72 min Asano spreads to Ito down the right and again he crosses low, but this time Croatia turn it away at the front post easily enough. So Croatia counter, Mdoric darts a cross-kick towards the far post \u2026 and goodness me, that\u2019s Ito sticking it out for a corner. He\u2019s got some lungs!      4.30pm    71 min We\u2019re back in our expected pattern, I think: Croatia passing, Japan coiling.      4.30pm    70 min Mitoma attacks Pasalic on the outside, but runs out of pitch. Meantime, Sam Hankins emails on \u201cThe other, better Murakami; if I might, I\u2019d like to recommend the other, better Murakami ... Ryu. Almost Transparent Blue, Coin Locker Babies, In the Miso Soup, and Audition ... all are worthy expressions of a side of Japanese culture that the effete Haruki would never touch. Cheers.\u201d     4.28pm    68 min Another change for Croatia, Pasalic on for Kramaric. Thing is, Croatia can keep making these changes but the truth is that they can\u2019t find a proper goal-threat because they just don\u2019t have one.     4.27pm    67 min Croatia\u2019s delivery into the box has been much better since half-time, and Kramaric, out on the left, comes infield and curls to the far post \u2026 where Budimir lurks! This is a chance! But from eight yards, he can only head wide of the far post!      4.25pm    66 min \u201cDo they still play this schoolyard game from the 70s?\u201d wonders Zafar Soban. \u201cKick a ball around in a circle (or square) and whoever is responsible for it going out gets kicked by everyone else until he makes it out of the square. Heaven help you if you fell down in the middle far from safety!\u201d This is how rondos should end.      4.24pm    65 min I keep saying it, but this is really good game \u2013 by far the best of the round, by my calculations, and the tension is own going to increase.      4.24pm    64 min Now two changes for Japan, Asano and Mitoma replacing Nagatomo and Maeda. Maeda has given this game everything.      4.23pm    63 min Kovacic wins a big header as Japan clear another Lovren ball into the box \u2013 who knew he had this in him? - and Modric controls, the ball bounces, sits up, and he clobbers a looping shot that the flying Gonda tips over the bar.   Updated at 4.29pm GMT    4.21pm    62 min Change for Croatia, Budimir replacing Petkovic \u2013 who\u2019s had a mare.  Updated at 4.25pm GMT    4.21pm    60 min Doan has been the best player on the pitch and again, he wanders infield, collects possession and, turning Barisic who\u2019s right up against him, shoots from on the ground. But because of the pressure and position, he can\u2019t get much purchase on the effort, and Livakovic saves easily enough.      4.19pm    59 min Oooh yeah, this is on a rolling boil now, Croatia finding the energy that was so conspicuous by its absence in the first half. Modric presses, wins it high, releases Perisic, and when the low cross comes in, it looks like it\u2019s dropping for Brozovic, running on and poised to unleash the traction engine \u2026 only for a desperate slide, by Taniguchi I think, to take the ball away from him.      4.17pm    57 min Japan being Japan, immediately they fly down the other end and when Endo has a shy from 25 yards, the unsighted Livakovic is forced to tip over; the corner comes to nowt.      4.16pm   GOAL! Japan 1-1 Croatia (Perisic 55)  This is a goal of simple brilliance. Croatia knock it about aimlessly, then Lovren sticks a tremendous ball into the box and Perisic does superbly not only to get in front of his man and apply the nut, but to cut across it and send it across Gonda, curling into the far corner, from a fair old way out! Game on!    Updated at 4.19pm GMT    4.13pm    54 min This time, Doan\u2019s corner goes straight into the box and the delivery is poor, so Croatia clear.      4.13pm    53 min Croatia are pushing a bit harder now. But Petkovic, out on the right, thrashes a ball across the width of the pitch to no one and Japan counter, Ito crossing from the right and Gvardiol forced to head behind away from Maeda.      4.12pm    51 min I guess it\u2019s a sign of how good Japan are that Kyogo can\u2019t even get into the squad. Meantime, a ball into the box sees Gonda come and claim with Kramaric going down; Perisic wants a penalty, but the ref is having no such thing though, looking again, there\u2019s a bit of contact from Tomiyasu, challenging from behind.      4.10pm    51 min \u201cI agree that Wind-up Bird Chronicle is Murkami\u2019s best,\u201d emails K\u00e1ri Tulinius, \u201cbut I wouldn\u2019t start with it because you need to trust that he\u2019s going somewhere, because it starts so slowly. I\u2019d begin with Norwegian Wood or Hardboiled Wonderland. And if we\u2019re recommending Japanese literature, I loved Kikuko Tsumara\u2019s There\u2019s No Such Thing as an Easy Job, and Y\u016bko Tsushima\u2019s Territory of Light.\u201d     4.09pm    49 min which Juranovic hurls long, and Kovacic, on the edge of the box, hooks over his shoulder \u2026 but the ball drops wide. He\u2019s hardly been in the game so far, and in general, that is my major criticism of him: when he\u2019s doing stuff, he\u2019s excellent, but stuff passes him by too often.      4.07pm    47 min :\u201dAs a Croatian person, I\u2019m rather surprised you like Croatian beaches,\u201d says Valdo, \u201cas Croatia\u2019s coastline is rocky and the vast majority of beaches are either rocky themselves, or artificial concrete beaches (which is as awful as it sounds). For a really great beach I recommend Alicante, Spain. Ice cream is good, though. But expensive. Croatia is the most expensive country in the Mediterranean. I\u2019m really bad at patriotism, sorry.\u201d Hvar and Brac are great, I thought \u2013 and definitely better than Trieste and Ancona, where I also went on that holiday.      4.05pm    46 min Is this one match too far for this Croatia? Kamada picks up a loose ball, dips inside, and lashes a shot that' flies not too far over the bar.      4.05pm    46 min We go again, no changes \u2013 unlike previously, Japan don\u2019t need to, while Croatia don\u2019t have enough in reserve to start messing at this stage.      4.04pm    Half-time email: \u201cI second your recommendation of Wind-Up Bird Chronicle,\u201d says Joseph Trivers. \u201cMy favourite, and I think his best, novel. It really is peak Murakami. I also like Killing Comendatore. In both novels, the marriage of classical music and jazz with the narrative works very well and adds a layer of meaning. OK, 1Q84 makes excellent use of its references to music, but I don\u2019t think it is as strong a novel as the other two. (I fully admit that I might be overestimating Killing Commendatore as my in-laws live in the area where the novel takes place and I was a bit nostalgic whilst reading.) But just don\u2019t stop at the novels - the short stories are exquisite as well - the collections The Elephant Vanishes, After the Quake, and Men Without Women in particular.\u201d Wind-Up Bird was the first novel of his I read and I was on holiday at the time \u2013 as with music, the impact of a book is contingent us much on us as it \u2013 but still. And, even though I speak no Japanese, I can tell that the translation is brilliant and better than in some of his other work.      3.51pm   Who do you support?  Before you reach for the half-time oranges, please consider supporting Guardian journalism like this, for three reasons: \u2022 We are independent - no one tells us what we can and can\u2019t publish (and that includes Fifa) \u2022 We rely on readers funding us to keep us independent \u2022 We give you the full picture - the excitement on the pitch and the shame, corruption and injustice off it Support the Guardian from as little as \u00a31 \u2013 it only takes a minute. Thank you.      3.50pm   Half-time: Japan 1-0 Croatia  Japan have played really well, moving the ball quickly, running aggressively and playing with greater imagination than Croatia. The second half should be a belter.      Updated at 3.52pm GMT    3.50pm    45+3 min Croatia go short too, but the ball that comes in is floaty and Lovren can\u2019t get make a decent connection.      3.49pm    45+2 min Modric sticks another ball into the box and Petkovic\u2019s spin and cross yields a corner off Yoshida. It\u2019ll be this, then the whistle\u2026     3.48pm    45 min There\u2019ll be two added minutes, and co-commentators, taking the mick out of how long was added earlier is to the detriment of the game and also to fans who pay to attend. We see too little football in every 90 minutes, and there should be pressure to keep playing more, not snarky comments.      3.47pm    44 min There\u2019s a VAR check for offside, but it\u2019s clear!      3.46pm   GOAL! Japan 1-0 Croatia (Maeda 43)  Japan have earned this! I\u2019ve been really impressed with their short corners \u2013 it\u2019s not often we see any that are any good \u2013 but what happens here is it goes to Doan, he goes one more to Morita, and when the ball comes back, he curls in a delectable cross to the far post, where Yoshida\u2019s challenge squirts it square and Maeda forces home from close range!    Updated at 3.57pm GMT    3.44pm    42 min Here come Japan again, Ito stepping inside and crossing from the left, Juranovic taking the law into his own hands and thunking a header behind as Livakovic comes to collects. The corner yields another\u2026     3.43pm    40 min Croatia win a free-kick when Yoshida fouls Petkovic, hurting himself in the process. The ball in, though, is poor, and Japan counter at pace, recycling when they don\u2019t find an immediately telling ball, then Ito backheels and Kamada collects, a fine first touch and clever chop earning him a shooting opportunity down the left of the box \u2026 but his floaty curler drifts over the bar. Japan are much sharper and more cohesive in attack.      3.41pm    38 min \u201cThe only Murakami I\u2019ve read is Kafka on the Shore,\u201d says Joe Pearson. \u201cIntriguing, for sure, but it did not entice me to further pursue his oeuvre. I\u2019m probably just a philistine. Shrug.\u201d I quite enjoyed it, but it\u2019s a long way off Wind-Up Bird, I\u2019d say. Norwegian Wood and What I Talk About When I Talk About Running are also good.   Updated at 3.51pm GMT    3.39pm    37 min Nice spin from Kamada, whose ball out wide is intercepted by Brozovic\u2019s slide. Then \u201cModric gives it away again,\u201d not words anyone supposed to ever speak, but Jermaine Jenas says them and he\u2019s right.      3.38pm    36 min Doan looks really dangerous. Nominally, he\u2019s playing on the right-wing, but actually, he\u2019s buzzing about there and in central areas and Croatia haven\u2019t got to grips with him.      3.37pm    34 min Morita lofts long and Doan controls well at an awkward height knocking off. Japan can\u2019t find the right pass immediately, but they keep the ball well and one pacey pass, fed into Doan facilitates a one-touch turn around the corner into Maeda, who collects on the half-turn \u2026 but whose control means the ball doesn\u2019t come with him.      3.35pm    33 min We\u2019ve not seen much attacking from Japan these last 10 minutes, but they won\u2019t mind that, because the more Croatia attack, the more the open themselves out to being countered on.      3.34pm    31 min It\u2019s occurred to me that I\u2019ve been talking about Japan for a good 90 minutes now, and haven\u2019t recommended Haruki Murakami\u2019s Wind-Up Bird Chronicle. So allow me to address that now: it\u2019s an unbelievably good book, which I know is no revelation, but if you\u2019ve not read it, you definitely should. He has other good ones too, but this is the best \u2013 by far, in mine.      3.32pm    30 min \u201cCroatia\u2019s kit is pretty smart\",\u201d reckons Charles Antaki, \u201cbut it\u2019s a shame they\u2019ve given up on the big squares they had in 2018 \u2013 that was an aesthetic classic. In the same vein, I thought the Poland kit this year was absolutely beautiful: simple, clean and not contaminated with bizarre ad hoc decorations (like, for example, the ludicrous flames on the Belgian sleeves, not to mention the meaningless blue-stripey epaulets on the English shirts).\u201d I love all Croatia kits because of the uniqueness of the flag it represents. I enjoyed the white Ghana kit too \u2013 the red was dreadful \u2013 and think South Korea have captured a luscious shade of red.      3.31pm    28 min Croatia create, Modric lofting a trademark outside-of-the-boot ball for Perisic, on the left of the box; his volleyed cross it just too strong, but pressure is maintained and the attack sustained, Barisic crossing well, Perisic flicking on, and Kramaric only just unable to apply the far-post poke that would\u2019ve put his team in front.   Updated at 3.41pm GMT    3.29pm    28 min \u201cWe played a version of Green Pig,\u201d says Joe Pearson, \u201cbut you put your thumb to your forehead with your fingers fanned out. No one says anything. The last person to notice has to \u2018sniff it up\u2019. I know, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d     3.28pm    26 min Here come Croatia, a hopeful ball from Gvardiol missed by Yoshida and releasing Petkovic! He trundles into the box, on its left, and has Perisic shrieking for a cut-back and Kramaric squealing for a square-pass \u2026 so he hangs onto it until a defenders comes close, before trying a nutmeg ball towards the latter, with predictable results.      3.26pm    24 min A foul on Gvardiol gives Croatia a free-kick 40 yards from goal and he goes forward. Modric curls the free-kick into the middle of the box \u2013 I\u2019m not sure what he\u2019s aiming for there \u2013 but it\u2019s not properly cleared, and from the edge, Gvardiol \u2013 with a decent angle and a bit of time \u2013 finds an angle of elevation that looked impossible given the speed on the ball and his body-shape.     3.24pm    22 min \u201cMy children regularly leave me black and blue with a variation called \u2018Mini Punch\u2019 whenever a Mini is seen,\u201d brags Ben Campbell. \u201cAnd it\u2019s not the punches which are mini...\u201d They have a tremendous grasp of irony, so must be very advanced. Top, top parenting.      3.22pm    20 min Yup, Japan have Croatia on absolute toast \u2013 mmm, absolute toast \u2013 in wide areas, Ito skinning Barisic again and crossing low \u2026 but Livakovic is able dive onto the ball, unchallenged, at his near post.      3.21pm    19 min This time, Doan intimates a shot from 35 yards, then dinks into the box and Croatia clear. This game\u2019s tempo is like that of the finest Not Kosher.      3.20pm    18 min Japan play into Doan, who sees Gvardiol coming so gets body between man and ball, wearing the inevitable flattening. Free-kick Japan\u2026     3.19pm    17 min Kamada finds Nagatomo down the left, and he comes inside then curls in another gorgeous cross that Maeda looks like he\u2019s up for first \u2026 but isn\u2019t, Gvardiol doing just enough to stop him heading for goal. Japan look really dangerous going forward \u2013 more so than Croatia so far.      3.18pm    16 min Croatia knock it about, Lovren lofting a ball down the inside-right channel, Modric \u2013 how\u2019s he got the energy to get down there? \u2013 controlling, on the run, with the chest-shoulder junction. He\u2019s penalised for handball, which looks pretty harsh to me.      3.16pm    14 min \u201cNutmeg Rush of course!\u201d says Kieran Monaghan. \u201cIt combined the skill of football with violence. No goals, no teams just your footwork against a pack of ravenous school chums that wanted you to taste their leather. The aim of the game was to avoid the ball going through your legs and should such an event occur, proceed with handing out a beating to the guilt party. It was strange as there was no official time limit or severity relating to any \u2018rushing\u2019, the tough lads would accept maybe a punch each from the nerds and at times there could be a real solemn moment prior to them taking a whack, more of an obligation to dish out one punch, in the arm mostly. Others, well, the less said the better. I remember a lad missed the ski trip as he\u2019d been protecting himself from being kneed in the tailbone repeatedly and broke two fingers. A game of fine margins, indeed.\u201d     3.15pm    12 min Modric tries to pick a way through the centre of the Japan defence but his pass is intercepted and Japan build, a pass out to Ito followed by a sensational low cross that Maeda, who steals away from Lovren, can\u2019t quite reach on the slide \u2026 then Nagatomo, at the back post, fouls Juranovic trying to force the ball in. Japan have made two really decent chances here, and this is a really good game already.      3.13pm    10 min \u201cDid anyone else play Secret Service?\u201d wonders Guy Stephenson. \u201cOne person discretely puts their finger to an imaginary earpiec and waits for others to catch on and do the same, until only one person is left not touching an earpiece. That person becomes the President, and is quickly tackled to the ground and piled up on for their own safety.\u201d Altruism at its finest.      3.12pm    8 min A ball down the left sees Perisic pursue Tomiyasu and give him a crafty shove in the back \u2013 not enough excuse for the backpass he tickles nowhere near Gonda! Persisic, entering the box from the side, is in! He\u2019s got so much time, but can\u2019t measure his finish into the far corner, Gonda shoving out and Kramaric unable to get around the ball to force hit home through the 63 defenders gathered between it and goal.   Updated at 3.16pm GMT    3.10pm    7 min Croatia\u2019s midfield are starting to impose themselves; is starting to impose itself, I\u2019m not sure. I think both might work. Meantime, Casiano Martinez returns: \u201cOh, I\u2019ve got another. Dark Fights. On your birthday, black out the bedroom and have all your friends wail on each other, for a minute, ideally but impossible to be certain, targeting the birthday boy. You know, typing this down I can see why my wife looks aghast at me when I tell her about these games, or why she mutters about boys being so stupid.\u201d We did birthday beats, and also pole jobs, which involved you getting a hiding till you went horizontal, then you were charged at the nearest upright metal \u2013 fence, goalpost \u2013 legs apart.      3.07pm    5 min \u201cGrowing up in NYC in the mid-60s,\u201d says Barry Ragin, \u201cfriends and I had a game called Green Pig. To put it in family friendly terms, if anyone passed gas in the room, everyone had to put their fist to their chin and say \u2018Green Pig.\u2019 Last one got a pummelling. Imagine my surprise meeting someone nearly two decades younger than me who had grown up in rural North Carolina who played the same game.\u201d Art transcends geographical differences.      3.06pm    4 min Croatia, though, are like a boa constrictor, gradually strangling opponents until they can\u2019t breathe. They won\u2019t be fazed by any of this; six of their last seven tournament knockout games have gone to extra time.      3.05pm    3 min Croatia try to play out and Maeda slides in on Livakovic, almost robbing him! This is a really good and intense start from Japan.      3.04pm    2 min \u2026and Doan\u2019s ball in is a belter, flying flat across the box and missing a decent touch from everyone. Someone, though, sticks it behind and Japan go short with the corner, Ito swishing in another tremendous ball \u2026 that Taniguchi heads wide of the far post! He should\u2019ve done better, but Japan are into this!   Updated at 3.09pm GMT    3.03pm    1 min Maeda advances down the left and Juranovic fouls him, so Japan have an early chance to stick a ball into the box\u2026     3.02pm    1 min And away we go!   Updated at 3.04pm GMT    3.02pm    Tiesto's Lets Get Down to Business pumps. It\u2019s actually the tune my wife plays when doing the Passover cleaning; I\u2019m not sure what that tells us.       3.00pm    \u201cYellow car?\u201d says Casiano Martinez. \u201cWe played a variation of it called Punch Buggie, where instead of yellow cars we went by Volkswagen Beetles. You just yelled the color of the car along with the phrase punch buggie. All of the mentioned rules apply. Incidentally, this didn\u2019t have a name but I\u2019ve wondered if others played it, when I was in middle school the boys used to come behind each other when one of us was at the urinals and either pull you out or push you in (mid-stream of course), and to this day I don\u2019t know what was worse.\u201d If you stand with one foot in front of the other, you prevent the push in. I realise this tip comes too late to be of much use.      2.58pm    Anthem time\u2026     2.56pm    Question, perhaps the most Guardian question of all-time: does Croatia have the best beaches and the best ice cream in Europe? If there are and is better, I\u2019ve not experienced them and it.      2.55pm    Here come the teams!      2.55pm    BBC telly have also done a little Gvardiol spot, prompting Alan Shearer to quip that he\u2019d look good in black and white \u2013 based on the below, I guess he\u2019s dropping Sven Botman. Gary Lineker points out that he\u2019s said that every time a player\u2019s done well in Qatar; \u201cmakes a change,\u201d replies Shearer, without taking a second to wonder why.       2.51pm    Feel free to send in your other childhood \u2013 or not \u2013 games. Another I recall is a group standing in a circle with arms around shoulders and tripping each other until only one person was left standing. I went home, told my dad about it, and turned out he\u2019d played it at primary school too, so it\u2019s at least 65 years old.      2.47pm    \u201cThere is no way a taxi on tv should count!\u201d says Joe Pearson. \u201cIf media were allowed, one could simply keep a picture of a yellow car on their phone and pull it up whenever they wanted to give their competitor a smack. Fine margins, you know.\u201d I can\u2019t lie, the other day I did ask my daughter to step outside, so I could yellow car her using a strange van-type thing that parks down our road and never moves.  Updated at 2.49pm GMT    2.45pm    Email! \u201cYellow Car was officially banned in a small Scottish enclave in North Northants,\u201d says Jack Roe, \u201cbecause my mate James McCallum refused to stop belting me whenever he saw any vehicle even slightly jaundiced. For the record, I\u2019m a purist: cars only, in person, one dig, above the waist. Anything else is just violence.\u201d Funny you say that, my nine-year-old has recently been grousing because I\u2019ve started giving her a few little shots as she\u2019s clocking me as hard as she can. Tangentially, I\u2019ve just remembered a similar game of my youth which we knew as Not Kosher. The bed was kosher, everywhere else was not kosher, and the last one left remained kosher so was therefore the winner. Er, and I\u2019ve just consulted with Wikipedia, learnt that the first Royal Rumble was in 1988, and have instructed my lawyers to sue Vince McMahon.      2.40pm    I think it took five minutes for BBC to start talking about England. What kept them?     2.39pm    Here\u2019s today\u2019s World Cup Football Daily:      2.38pm    Breaking news: I think Gary Lineker has new glasses \u2013 and surprisingly, they\u2019ve got a crossbar. I absolutely did not see that one coming.      2.35pm    On 5 live, Harry Redknapp\u2019s Niko Kranjcar is talking about Josko Gvardiol, who looks a very serious player. His best attribute, says Kranjcar, is his decision-making, but he also reads the game really well and is good on the ball whether passing or carrying. I mentioned that Croatia have only scored on one game, but they\u2019ve also only conceded once, and he\u2019s a big part of the reason why.  Updated at 2.48pm GMT    2.31pm    Yellow car rule verification: does the game apply solely to cars, or are other vehicles, such as lorries, buses and ambulances allowed? And do the cars have to be seen in person?  Yours, someone who got whacked when a New York taxi appeared on television yesterday.      2.29pm    Croatia might also fancy themselves out wide \u2013 as any team playing an opponent fielding three at the back should, but I also reckon they\u2019ll expect Japan to leave gaps there when they fly forward. They\u2019ve struggled to score in this competition \u2013 both Belgium and Morocco have shut them out \u2013 so have rearranged their front three once again in a bid to find some edge.      2.25pm    Thinking about how the game might go, my guess is that Japan will look to get at Croatia down the sides. They\u2019ll know they\u2019ve no chance of dominating possession so I doubt they\u2019ll even try \u2013 in picking two central-midfielders against Croatia\u2019s three, they\u2019re effectively ceding control of the game. Which makes a lot of sense, because even if they had a third man in there, they\u2019d still be struggling to dictate, so may as well try and create overloads out wide.      2.19pm    As for Croatia, Borna Sosa is ill, so Borna Barisic, of Rangers, replaces him while, in attack, Marko Livaja loses out to Bruno Petkovic.      2.18pm    So what does it all mean? Well, Japan are without the suspended Kou Itakura, who is replaced by Takehiro Tomiyasu on the right side of the back three. Ao Tanaka, meanwhile, is on the bench, with Wataru Endo coming in, and Ritsu Doan, the supersub who scored against both Germany and Spain, replaces Takefusa Kubo, who I think is injured.      2.09pm   Teams!  Japan (3-4-3): Gonda; Tomiyasu, Yoshida, Taniguchi; Ito, Morita, Junya, Nagatomo; Doan, Maeda, Kamada. Subs: Kawashima, Mitoma, Saai, Hato, Schmidt, Minamino, Machino, Yamane, Tanaka, Ueda, Shibasaki, Asano, Soma. Croatia (4-3-3): Livakovic; Juranovic, Lovren, Gvardiol, Barisic; Brozovic, Kovacic, Modric; Petkovic, Kramaric, Perisic. Subs: Grbic, Ivusic, Erlic, Majer, Vlasic, Livaja, Pasalic, Budimir, Orsic, Vida, Sutalo, Sucic, Jakic. Referee: Ismail Elfath (USA)     1.30pm   Preamble  So who had this one on their predictor? Er, not me. But what a match is in prospect \u2013 let\u2019s be real, it\u2019s the only one of the eight ties in which the outcome seems in doubt at the outset \u2013 and feels by far the most likely to give us extra-time and the lottery of successfully executing a precision-skill under intense pressure. Japan have been an absolute rush and one of the most affirming joys of this World Cup. Beating Germany and Spain is one thing \u2013 well, two things \u2013 but beating Germany and Spain from behind is one of the \u2013 well, two of the \u2013 most reeeediculous feats in recent times. And that\u2019s only part of it: what\u2019s been just as wondrous is the inspirational invention and screeching intensity of their play; if they can find similar this afternoon, we\u2019re in for a treat. However, if anyone has the antidote for that, it\u2019s Croatia and, in particular, Luka Modric. He may be 37-years-old, but his ageless genius allows the last of the great schemers to somehow orchestrate proceedings involving 21 other, younger players. I say somehow because, like all the most gifted exponents of any art, quite how he does it is shrouded in mystery. But he is also abetted by the all-round efficiency of Mateo Kovacic and Marcelo Brozovic, a midfield trio accomplished enough to decide which of these teams progresses.  This is going to be really, really good. Kick-off: 6pm local, 3pm GMT  Updated at 1.33pm GMT "

                    "body": "The US men\u2019s national team drew 0-0 with Saudi Arabia in Spain on Tuesday in their final game before their opening World Cup clash against Wales on 21 November. Following on from Friday\u2019s tame 2-0 loss to Japan in Germany, these were two tune-ups that served to underline the team\u2019s shortcomings rather than solve them, played in low-key atmospheres that felt more like pre-season friendlies than the last international fixtures before a World Cup. Context is key It was a series that was more send-to-sleep than send-off, but let\u2019s acknowledge the weird circumstances. A game in front of 364 spectators (yes, 364!) on a bad pitch at the home of third-tier Real Murcia is not the sort of occasion that promotes good vibrations. Contrast with June 2014, when the US were roared off to Brazil with a pair of 2-1 wins: over Turkey in front of a sell-out 26,672 crowd at Red Bull Arena and Nigeria before 52,033 in Jacksonville. The US beat Ghana in their opening group game in Brazil nine days after that victory in Florida. But this group of players are heading back to their clubs, some of them facing another dozen fixtures or so until Qatar 2022 kicks off. It would have carried an injury risk but US Soccer may have cause to regret not arranging another friendly in November, as a number of nations have done, including Mexico and Canada. On this evidence a final dress rehearsal on the eve of the tournament would have been useful.  If the US don\u2019t have pace and intensity, they don\u2019t have much Head coach Gregg Berhalter has discarded some experienced names in order to shape what will be one of the youngest rosters in Qatar. That reflects a conscious break with the past after the failure of Bruce Arena\u2019s veterans to reach the 2018 tournament, and also a desire to instill a dynamic pressing style that Berhalter hopes will compensate for a talent deficit relative to the gaudiest World Cup rosters. But when they\u2019re being outmuscled and outhustled, as was the case against Japan and for some of Tuesday\u2019s game, they seem to drift, unable to find a quick course correction unless Berhalter shakes things up with substitutions or Christian Pulisic takes charge. That\u2019s partly down to a lack of experience, but it also reflects a dependency on midfielder Weston McKennie. Barrelling into dangerous areas, he was an inspirational link to the forwards when the US were at their best during Concacaf qualifying. However, the Juventus man was poor against Japan and mediocre against Saudi Arabia and as a result the US lacked command in midfield. These slapdash two matches have made it even more obvious that Yunus Musah\u2019s tenacity and resilience under pressure are going to be critical against World Cup-calibre nations. The Valencia midfielder was missing from this camp through injury; but his absence only enhanced his reputation. Striking shortcomings persist Two shots on target against Saudi Arabia; none against Japan. A team that entered the international window lacking a proven goalscorer ended it none the wiser given the lack of good chances. It means that Jesus Ferreira of FC Dallas remains the favorite to start against Wales, and he did force goalkeeper Mohammed Al-Yami into an admittedly straightforward save soon after coming on for Ricardo Pepi. With a paltry 13 touches, Pepi didn\u2019t get the opportunity to demonstrate that he\u2019s rediscovering his scoring touch after a fallow period of almost a year. It\u2019s fair to say this fixture wasn\u2019t much of a confidence-booster for the teenager.  Also dishearteningly, one of the squad\u2019s shiniest creative forces, Gio Reyna, exited after half an hour as a precaution with muscle tightness. The 19-year-old\u2019s injury history means he\u2019s best treated as a potential impact substitute despite his starting XI-level ability. And Pulisic was muted. Berhalter\u2019s side have scored once in six games on foreign soil this year. It\u2019s been more than a year since they won on the road and they haven\u2019t found the net in six of their 12 games in 2022. The battle to be No 1 is done Japan\u2019s dominance gave Matt Turner the chance to showcase his shot-stopping skills and the clean sheet against Saudi Arabia also enhanced the Arsenal back-up\u2019s case to start in Qatar. The 28-year-old is surely now the undisputed first choice, with his only serious rival, Zack Steffen, absent from the camp. Berhalter had been expected to give possible third-choices Ethan Horvath and Sean Johnson some action but Turner played every minute of both matches. With the center back slot next to Walker Zimmerman still very much up for grabs, Turner looked reassuringly reliable. The identity of the goalkeeper likely to start against Wales might have been the only issue Berhalter was able to resolve to his satisfaction after a pair of games that proved more confounding than clarifying. Uncertainty is certain in Qatar Was this an improved performance compared with the Japan game? Slightly, yes. But Saudi Arabia are a worse team than Japan. And they still carved out better chances than the Americans. For what it\u2019s worth, neither opponent has ever gone beyond the round of 16 at a World Cup. Brow furrowed, weight of the world on his shoulders, Berhalter stalked the touchline like a technical-area Hamlet, dressed all in Nike black, as if attending a memorial service with a sports-casual dress code. But no need to issue the obituary notices just yet for the US\u2019s prospects of progressing from Group B, which also comprises England and Iran in addition to Wales. The performances in the past two games are sure to generate pessimism, but they should also strike a note of realism. So much emotional energy has been invested in returning to the World Cup after eight years, with less consideration of how the team might fare in Qatar. The US looked what they are: Concacaf\u2019s third-best nation, missing half-a-dozen players. Berhalter\u2019s team have shown they can raise their game against their greatest rivals, Mexico, so it\u2019s perfectly possible that they will be inspired on the greatest stage come November. Or that they\u2019ll get some early luck or benefit from a moment of individual greatness that will send their self-belief soaring. Then again, this is an injury-prone side short of depth \u2013 the US struggles if their handful of stars are absent or out of sorts \u2013 and they need to get things right from the start, as it\u2019s hard to imagine them qualifying from the group if they lose the opening clash with Wales. Berhalter is certainly executing a masterclass in managing expectations downwards. After admitting to reporters that the team \u201cgot our butts kicked\u201d by Japan, he said that \u201canxiety\u201d and a lack of confidence affected the display against Saudi Arabia. The only ways from here are up \u2026 or out."

So it is no surprise that Saturday\u2019s quarter-final between England and France is being seen as a royal duel between King Kylian and Prince Harry.\nAfter Sunday\u2019s matches set the scene for a battle between the two countries \u2013 historic rivals on and off the pitch despite the Entente Cordiale \u2013 Eurosport carried a picture of Harry Kane and Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 and declared: \u201cThe quarter-final on Saturday will have an unusual flavour: for the first time in history the French team and the English team will cross swords in a direct elimination match.\u201d\nFrance Info headlined with France meeting its \u201cbest enemy\u201d and \u201cPrince Harry\u201d referring to Kane making the \u201cFrench kingdom tremble\u201d.\n\nNo reference to the Anglo-French rivalry is complete without a reference to \u201cperfidious Albion\u201d and France Info did not disappoint. \u201cBetween France and England, [football] history dates back more than a century to the first match on 1 November 1906 [which England won 15-0],\u201d it said.\n\u201cSince then, Perfidious Albion have won 23 of the 40 official duels, with 11 victories for the French and six draws. But 16 of these successes were achieved before the war \u2026 In the 21st century, Les Bleus have won four of the six encounters, with one defeat and one draw. And while this match has become a European classic, it will be the first time the two nations have faced each other in an international tournament\u2019s decisive match.\u201d\nL\u2019\u00c9quipe carried a photo of Mbapp\u00e9 with the headline: \u201cGod Save Notre [Our] King\u201d. The French crown should have been shared with Olivier Giroud, who became France\u2019s leading goalscorer after Sunday\u2019s match against Poland when he recorded his 52nd and surpassed the 13-year-old national record set by Thierry Henry.\nThe regional newspaper Sud-Ouest asked if Les Bleus were \u201cpr\u00eats \u00e0 manger du lion\u201d, ready to eat the Lions, while Le Figaro said facing England could be France\u2019s first serious challenge. \u201cFor those who thought that the French team\u2019s journey so far was too easy, it is possible that they will change their minds next Saturday, on the occasion of a quarter-final between Les Bleus and England, which is as explosive as it is attractive .\n\n\u201cThe two teams have not faced each other since 13 June 2017, when Didier Deschamps\u2019 men got the better of the Three Lions in a friendly match at the Stade de France. But in five years, a lot of water has flowed under the bridges of the Seine and the Thames. Since the start of the competition, both teams have impressed \u2026 this means that both Les Bleus and the Three Lions will have plenty of confidence going into the quarter-final.\u201d\nMany French commentators relayed remarks from across the Channel indicating admiration \u2013 some saw fear \u2013 of Mbapp\u00e9. The football website maxifoot.fr said he was \u201calready causing \u201cdeep concern\u201d in the England camp.\nEngland\u2019s Phil Foden told TF1 that Mbapp\u00e9 is \u201cthe player of the tournament until now\u201d and his teammate Jordan Henderson told Belgian journalists he was \u201cprobably the best player in the world right now, with Messi\u201d. French journalists relayed how Sky Sports had referred to \u201cthe Mbapp\u00e9 threat\u201d.\nKing Mbapp\u00e9, who has earned the French Football Federation a \u20ac10,000 fine from Fifa for refusing to speak to the press, broke his silence after Sunday\u2019s victory to declare: \u201cMy sole aim is to win the World Cup \u2026 and the next match. It\u2019s the only thing I dream about.\u201d\nIn the other realm, Prince Harry has the same goal."

More welcoming. And you can definitely see it in Qatar.\u201d\nMohamed\u2019s father, Abdul, explained that he had always dreamed of taking his son to a World Cup. Now they were here in England shirts for what they both called a trip of a lifetime. \u201cOver the weekend England and Wales fans were fighting in Spain,\u201d added Abdul. \u201cBut there are no issues here. Perhaps the lack of alcohol has something to do with it, but it feels safe and welcoming.\u201d\nThese were not isolated voices. On the metro Tarique Ghaffur, a former assistant commissioner with the Met, stressed how much English fan culture has improved since he was policing the terraces in the 70s. His son, FG, a prominent YouTuber who has worked with Manchester City, made it clear that he had never faced an issue in the game because of the colour of his skin. \u201cFootball is a global sport,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd a fantastic leveller.\u201d\n\n\nOf course the majority of England supporters in Qatar still conform to the traditional stereotype. But it is all a far cry from the last time the national team played in an away tournament, at the 2019 Nations League in Portugal. Thousands of fans caused general mayhem in Porto and sang songs about Tommy Robinson, the IRA and German bombers. Two England fans were also arrested after being baton-charged by police after hurling bottles at local supporters and police in a packed fan zone.\nSo what is going on? Several fans the Guardian spoke to suggested that because Qatar is a Muslim country and it is harder to find alcohol, they felt safer travelling out to support England. They knew they would not be drenched by a beer shower and the risk of antisocial behaviour would be lower.\nSeveral second-generation British Indians and Pakistanis also said they had family in the region, and so felt comfortable coming out. There are also many guest workers, particularly from India, who have adopted England as their favourite national team. And not always for football reasons either. As Nasisasa, from Thailand, put it to the Guardian: \u201cI support England because they are a good team \u2026 and their players are handsome.\u201d\n\nAnother factor, according to the academic Jamie Cleland, is that many younger white England fans have not travelled to Qatar because it is so expensive \u2013 which has broadened the fanbase. \u201cWith the World Cup occurring mid-season, close to Christmas, and in a cost of living crisis, it is no surprise to see so many traditional fans stay behind in the UK,\u201d he says.\nThe second academic Geoff Pearson agrees. \u201cOne way to look at a football team\u2019s support is to consider in terms of different subcultures that basically attend matches for different reasons,\u201d he explains. \u201cA lot of the work that I\u2019ve done has been about a subculture of English fans I call the carnival fan. They essentially travel and their primary focus is around the match, not the match itself.\u201d\nPearson, whose book An Ethnography of English Football Fans: Cans, Cops and Carnivals, is the definitive work on the subject, adds: \u201cTheir behaviour is based around transgression, intoxication, chanting and creating atmosphere. And when it comes to the English national team that subculture is predominantly male and predominantly white. Not exclusively male and not exclusively white. But it\u2019s very much laddish behaviour.\u201d\n\nWhat does that mean? According to Pearson it is \u201cbeer in the air, standing on tables, chanting, hanging flags up, that kind of thing. It\u2019s not violence. And it\u2019s not necessarily racist either. But it\u2019s predominantly white, male and laddish.\n\u201cHowever that subculture of England fans hasn\u2019t really travelled to Qatar in sufficient numbers. Whereas normally for tournaments, or big matches particularly in Europe, that subculture will dominate. And of course, that subculture will travel even if they don\u2019t have tickets, because actually attending the matches isn\u2019t primarily why they\u2019re there.\u201d\n\nThe situation is complicated and nuanced, but it suggests that what we are seeing in Qatar 2022 is a blip rather than a long-term trend. Pearson, for one, cautions that we may not see such diversity among England\u2019s fanbase for the 2024 European Championships in Germany.\n\u201cI think the fact that it\u2019s easy to get tickets in Qatar has made a big difference as well in terms of a more diverse fanbase,\u201d he adds. \u201cTo a certain extent, it\u2019s a bit of a closed shop for tournaments in Europe, in particular, because demand outstrips supply so greatly. If England qualifies for the Euros in two years\u2019 time it will be very very different indeed.\u201d"

                    "body": "\u201cHere for the weather! We\u2019re only here for the weather!\u201d chanted the band of travelling Wales fans on Thursday night, in wry acknowledgment at the sheer magnitude of the fixture. It wasn\u2019t a classic, but it didn\u2019t need to be. After a 1-0 win over Greece in hot, thundery Volos, Wales need only a point from their game against Slovenia in Cardiff on Tuesday to secure a playoff place for the 2023 Women\u2019s World Cup in Australia and New Zealand. Having lost only to Euros semi-finalists France so far in this campaign, the momentum is with Gemma Grainger\u2019s squad.  Almost three months to the day after the Welsh men qualified for their World Cup in Qatar, the Cardiff City Stadium is set for another emotional occasion. With 10,000 tickets having been sold already, doubling the previous record attendance for a women\u2019s fixture, Tuesday feels like a defining moment for this team. The players will have spent the summer feeling that Welsh\u2011est of emotions, the unique disappointment that comes from watching as spectators a tournament they came agonisingly close to qualifying for. With all the inevitability of an exercise bike purchased in lockdown being used as a clothes horse, Wales missed out on Euro 2022 in the most heart-breaking of circumstances. Finishing third in the group on equal points with Northern Ireland and with a far superior goal difference, they lost out by virtue of having a worse head-to-head record, as the away goals rule favoured Northern Ireland after a 2-2 draw in Newport before a 0-0 stalemate in the return fixture in Belfast.  Having lost narrowly to France in both fixtures in this World Cup campaign, this team know they can compete with some of Europe\u2019s best sides. For a fanbase that is so hungry for success, Welsh supporters could be forgiven for staring at the final table for Women\u2019s Euro 2022 qualifying Group C with disbelief as the eyes of the world focused on England this summer. Failing to qualify by virtue of the away goals rule in a head-to-head. We go again. Much has changed since that disappointment. Grainger was appointed Wales manager in March 2021, having spent 11 years working with the England age group setup. She was part of England\u2019s coaching staff for the Women\u2019s Euros in 2017, where England reached the semi-finals. Grainger can call upon a squad that has a healthy blend of youth and experience, with a talented core of senior players for whom this campaign offers a final chance of World Cup qualification. Carrie Jones \u2013 the scorer of Thursday night\u2019s winner \u2013 is only 19, and her place in the starting lineup might not have come if Jess Fishlock, who has a record 119 caps, had not taken a knock in training.  It was Jones\u2019s first goal for her country and capped a fine display from a very exciting young prospect. But a slice of reality tempered the elation she felt at scoring Thursday\u2019s winner as her heartbroken mother tweeted to say she\u2019d missed seeing it because she had to work a late shift for the NHS. There\u2019s no way the person in charge of that rota doesn\u2019t understand the magnitude of the game against Slovenia. One person who will be there on Tuesday night is Laura McAllister. She is deputy chair of the Uefa women\u2019s football committee, and was one of the three women who in 1993 successfully lobbied the Football Association of Wales to establish the women\u2019s team officially (an unofficial team, entirely organised and funded by the players already existed), before going on to captain the side. As much as McAllister would love to see established stars such as Sophie Ingle, Fishlock and Natasha Harding play at the highest level, McAllister\u2019s experience in sports governance makes her more aware than most of the potential benefits World Cup qualification could provide. \u201cIt\u2019s a total gamechanging moment,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s what we do with the funding and attention to grow the game for all girls. Every single stage needs proper investment, and the only way we\u2019ll do that is if we have the platform of the World Cup, and the funding and attention that comes with it.\u201d  With so many of the Welsh team playing across the border in the Women\u2019s Super League, the English success this summer has given even more impetus to the players. McAllister thinks England\u2019s tournament win will help Wales. The Bristol City and Wales defender Ffion Morgan described the Lionesses\u2019 Euros victory as \u201cbittersweet\u201d \u2013 a sentiment McAllister can appreciate. \u201cI understand Ffion\u2019s comments entirely. Because for me as well, there was disappointment at not seeing Cymru on the European stage. \u201cBut on the other hand, the success of the tournament has reverberations for all of us in the national associations across Europe. But I\u2019d say particularly for those of us like Wales where we already have a very clear strategy for how we develop the game. In a way, this just adds incentive and added pressure, but in a good way,to get there sooner.\u201d But Tuesday comes first. Slovenia are third in the group and two points behind Wales following a 1-1 draw in October. Wales will be roared on by an expectant, record crowd, the demographics of which are changing \u2013 something that interests McAllister. \u201cYes you have the children, we\u2019ve really pushed that, clubs and schools are buying blocks of tickets, but there\u2019s lots of men going to the games now, who are just members of the Red Wall \u2013 for them, it\u2019s just another Cymru game. And I like that normalisation. \u201cI think that\u2019s really important, that the two teams are seen as one in the fans\u2019 eyes. I think it\u2019s a breakthrough moment on Tuesday whatever happens, because the fanbase will be representative of what we\u2019ve wanted it to be for a long time.\u201d"

                    "body": "\u201cAnd the winner is \u2026 Qatar!\u201d It all began with those words, read out in a tone of strangled gaiety by Sepp Blatter on stage at Fifa house. Twelve years on Qatar 2022 has now concluded with the same phrase hanging in the air.\nProject Hard Football Power is complete. And it really could not have gone any better, a micromanaged power play, from the pharaonic-scale nation-building project, to the painted backdrop sets, to the regional visibility that helped see Qatar through the blockade years, to the chance at the death to parade Lionel Messi around the winners\u2019 enclosure like a beaming Guy Fawkes dummy. The winner is ... Qatar!\nThere were layers to that moment of ignition back in December 2010. Blatter\u2019s strange tone spoke to the fact that he also knew he was reading out his own redundancy note, that Qatar\u2019s victory indicated he, Blatter, had lost control of the show. Standing there stiff as a board, Blatter nudged J\u00e9r\u00f4me Valcke, who looked as if he was about to cry, and ordered him to smile.\n\nOn the back of that moment the house of Blatter would fall, the regime of the more opaque and unknowable Gianni Infantino would rise. And that stage of the cycle is now done. The most costly, carbon-heavy, bloodstained, corruption-shadowed event in the history of global sport is a wrap. But what does it mean? And what next?\nQatar 2022 also signalled the end of a few other things. For starters, the end of the pretence, and it was always a pretence, that there is any kind of innocence about Fifa\u2019s World Cup; that this is anything other than a marauding city state, out there circling the globe looking for the next compliant and complicit host to share in its gluttony.\n\nQatar has transformed football: you also hear this a lot. In reality Qatar has simply supercharged what was already there, presented us with football\u2019s standard corruption and hypocrisy stripped of artifice and gleamingly unapologetic.\nQatar didn\u2019t invent this world, didn\u2019t invent migrant labour, didn\u2019t invent global capitalism. It is simply the most zealous of late adopters, selling brutal carbon-fed hyper-capitalism back to the world in its final form, like the Beatles taking rock and roll to America.\nOn a more micro level the end of this World Cup is also the end of a generation of great players, perhaps even an end to the age of the modern-day individualist, a lineage that runs though Ronaldinho to Messi. Football is more compressed, more systems-led, more controlled than ever. It seems possible the highest stage may never again see a baggy, strolling 35-year-old conjurer of patterns. Similarly Cristiano Ronaldo, Neymar, Luka Modric, Karim Benzema, Robert Lewandowski, goodnight ladies, sweet ladies, good night.\n\nAnd for now, as the comedown starts to bite, there are probably three things worth saying about Qatar 2022. First, the football was excellent. The action on the pitch was luminous, packed with drama and topped with the greatest World Cup final ever staged.\nThere is no meaning to this, no moral to be drawn. The World Cup was good because football is good. This is why Qatar paid $220bn to borrow its light. It is why Fifa will rake in $7bn revenue from the show. This thing is supernaturally resilient, no matter how hard we may try to bend it out of shape.\nThere has been a lot of talk about the breadth and reach of this World Cup, the idea of new powers, a new world order. It is a good propaganda line for the organisers and host broadcasters. In reality eight of the last 16, five of the last eight, two of the final four were European nations. We did get Morocco and the thrill of a first African semi-finalist but even this is more complex. This was also a diaspora triumph, a triumph of expert management and fine domestic facilities, combined with multiculturalism.\n\nSeven starting players were products of European club academies and European childhoods, gelled into place with a Moroccan sense of togetherness that seemed to offer a model of how to live these many identities. This story is more nuanced, more interesting than simple parping regionalism.\nOtherwise the entertainment was derived from dramatic finishes and in-game tension as much as high quality. Take away Messi and there were no really exceptional teams outside France and Argentina. England, Croatia and Morocco were the second rank here. This is some pretty functional football. But they produced great games, plenty of goals, good refereeing and a welcome absence of red cards.\nFernando Santos single-handedly saved football by dropping Ronaldo and playing a 21-year-old who scored a hat-trick, one of the great managerial flexes of all time. Croatia were a captivating bunch of super-smart dinosaurs. Brazil did Brazil.\n\nAnd it was all a good job too because a bad World Cup on the pitch might just have fatally wounded the whole idea of international football given the backdrop to this thing.\nOtherwise Messi wrote the story of Qatar 2022 and did so while manifesting the key paradox of Big Football. Here is a player whose talent expresses freedom, beauty, love, imagination, uplifting human qualities. Messi is basically a sporting unicorn \u2013 and a highly unusual unicorn, the kind of unicorn even other unicorns look at and say: \u2018That unicorn, he\u2019s a bit special.\u2019\nOften the word \u201cplayer\u201d can feel like a ludicrous anachronism. Play is fun, joy, gratuitous things. Modern football, meanwhile, is a suffocating matrix, all constriction and physicality. Somehow Messi, the greatest footballer of the age, is also a player.\nAt the same time his professional existence is still lived out as a tool of despotic regimes, pegged out around the commoditised global game. Messi is the face of Qatar\u2019s propaganda World Cup. Messi is Saudi Arabia\u2019s tourism ambassador. It is almost an act of unintended rebellion to be all these things and to perform the way he does, the rebel heart to Argentinian football expressed not through any conscious act of will, not through guns and cops and drugs, but through a way of playing, the whisper of a free spirit.\n\nAside from all this, we still have the death. Not to mention suffering, corruption and grotesque monarchical vanity. So many things at this World Cup have seemed to be screaming in horror, from the open mouths of the gleaming stadium roofs, to the frightening cartoon avatars of the Bein Sports graphics, to the mind-numbing universal public address system.\nThe stage was haunted by ghosts. The People\u2019s World Cup was also the dead people\u2019s World Cup. We can argue over the final tally, which is also part of the horror, the lack of care, death as part of life, in the words of the dear old Supreme Delivery Committee. But this has been football as an accessory of the overclass world, football as VVIP product.\nThere are other costs. An otherworldly chill settled over Lusail Iconic Stadium an hour before kick-off in the World Cup final. Rain? Guilt? No, this was the giant-scale air-conditioning, brainchild of Qatar\u2019s famous \u201cDr Cool\u201d, whose indirect carbon footprint must be one of the most terrifyingly vast on earth. Hopefully Dr Cool also recycles and rides a bike. But we all pay for this in the end.\nOtherwise this was also a World Cup of illusion and fakery, football in the age of populism and post-truth. Concerns about a lack of care by the hosts have been routinely dismissed with useful, dead-end moral relativism; even described, absurdly, as racism (reality: few things are as racist as a structurally racist state carelessly harming migrant workers).\n\nFifa introduced the idea of \u201cunnatural lost time\u201d at this World Cup and Qatar 2022 has often felt like this, from the artful fakery of Stadium 974, which pretended to be an ecological triumph, to the strange dance of the conscience-laundering armbands, presumably long since burnt on the Al-Wakrah docks like the 1970 squad\u2019s van full of corned beef; to the malleable quality of Infantino who believes in revisiting European oppression from 3,000 years ago, but maintains he can\u2019t be held responsible for what happened at Fifa five years before he became president. Feeling dizzy yet?\nAnd this is the final thing worth saying about Qatar 2022, which in the end is simply a mirror to the world. Qatar is not an aberration. Qatar is the way the world works, presented to you with brutal, unapologetic clarity. Other nations may have checks and balances, trades unions, democracy, free speech, ways of mitigating the brutality of rule by an overclass. Doha may also have wilfully neglected its duty of care to migrant workers, explicitly targeting nations suffering most from climate change to build its World Cup, because desperate people are cheap people. This does not have to happen.\n\nBut in the end the real question about migrant workers is why are migrant workers so poor they are willing to do this, and who benefits from that world? Qatar 2022 may be a bloodstained thing but it is also a light and a lens, a crib-sheet on how the world works. Not to mention its superheated carbon centre. Qatar is the power source. Qatar is the winner: this was not an aberration, but a prophecy.\nA final note on what might happen next, beyond the US, Mexico and Canada in 2026 and our newly opened book on the morality of World Cup hosts. It was interesting that Michel Platini declined Emmanuel Macron\u2019s invitation to attend the World Cup final. Platini is said to be unwilling to meet Infantino and his circle, whom he sees as malevolent architects of his own downfall.\nThere is genuine enmity here. Platini is also free now of criminal charges. Infantino, newly re-elected, cosying up to world leaders, looks bulletproof. But if anyone knows anything about the things no one knows about, it is perhaps Platini, who doesn\u2019t seem to be done just yet."

                    "body": "  4.57pm    Thank you very much for joining me for a dramatic day in north London. Here is Aaron Bower\u2019s match report.       4.54pm    What a moment for Samoa.      4.49pm    Shaun Wane and the players will be soul searching after that underwhelming performance. It was all a touch flat for most of the 80 minutes, compounded by some tedious errors to help Samoa win.      4.43pm    Sam Tomkins: \u201cWe were the second best team.  \u201cThe amount of pressure we put ourselves under by making sloppy errors and not defending like we have for the past five weeks.  \u201cThey are a good side with a lot of good players \u2013 give them an opportunity and they will score.\u201d     4.42pm    Shaun Wane: \u201cNot good enough. The best team won.  \u201cI was never happy in our game, we were below our standards. There is some soul searching going on from the staff. I don\u2019t doubt the players\u2019 effort but we weren\u2019t good enough today. \u201cSamoa did the right things at the right time \u2013 and we didn\u2019t.\u201d It is fair to say, he is gutted.     4.39pm    BBC pundit Willie Poching is very emotional. A lovely moment for him and Samoa.      4.36pm    Jarome Luai: \u201cI don\u2019t think anyone gave us a chance tonight but the belief in the squad is very strong.  \u201cNot many calls went our way tonight but our scramble and brotherhood helped. \u201cWe are going to enjoy this moment and see what we can do next week.\u201d     4.33pm    What a moment for Samoa. Crichton kept his nerve before being completely mobbed by his teammates. A cruel blow for England but really they set their own downfall at the Emirates. They were not at their best and gave Samoa two chances to win it.      4.32pm   FULL-TIME: ENGLAND 26-27 SAMOA  SAMOA ARE IN THE FINAL! A forward pass from Tomkins gifts Samoa another set of six and a chance at a drop goal. It is a classic bit of going down the middle to set up the position. It gets sent back to Crichton who keeps his calm and sends the drop goal over for the golden point.   Updated at 4.41pm GMT    4.30pm    82 mins: England are doing as you would expect to get into the position for a drop goal but the ball runs free and Samoa pick it up. They run it down the middle to set up the drop goal. It goes back to Milford but England sprint out and Whitehead throws himself at the Samoan\u2019s boot to charge it down. This is savage.      4.28pm   Extra time  Next score wins! England receive it from kick off.     4.27pm    The players look tired and are some treatment from the physios.      4.26pm    It is golden point extra time!      4.25pm   Full-time: England 26-26 Samoa  We go to extra time!      4.23pm   TRY! England 26-26 Samoa (Farnworth, 78)  DRAMA! Samoa are just trying to gain ground rather than actually score. The key is important and it is lands with Makinson just in front of the try line. England make it to their own 10 on the third tackle. Williams breaks through and sends the ball out to Farnworth to sprint into space and get over the line. A big kick for Makinson from the left of the posts \u2026 he gets it!   Updated at 4.28pm GMT    4.20pm    76 mins: England need to give it everything now to take this match to extra-time. They go with a short kick-off and Young gets that to palm the ball back. They reach the 20 metre line on the third. Radley gets within five on the fifth. They are desperate to keep it alive but the result is the ball going a long way backwards as they panic.      4.18pm   TRY! England 20-26 Samoa (Crichton, 73)  Burgess bangs into a couple of defenders, as does Williams but it all goes wrong straight after. Radley looks to send a pass with an overload on the left but Crichton reads it, intercepts and runs half the length of the pitch before sliding over. What a moment for Samoa. Crichton gets the two.   Updated at 4.24pm GMT    4.15pm    72 mins: To\u2019o catches Tomkins kick on the last inside the 10 but England are straight into the Samoans, giving up nothing to the blue shirts. Samoa make it to the halfway line from where Milford sends a kick to Makinson, who runs across the line to make a few metres of ground.      4.13pm    70 mins: England have the momentum with them at the moment. Can they utilise it? Will Samoa bounce back due to the grievance they feel after that penalty? England\u2019s end a set of six with a big kick and follow it up with two huge tackles from Radley. England are up for this now and giving up no ground to Samoa.      4.11pm   PENALTY: England 20-20 Samoa (Makinson, 68)  ALL LEVEL! Tomkins puts up a kick, Suaali\u2019i is underneath it but a penalty is called for Paulo taking out the England captain off the ball. It goes to a captains review but the video referee agrees with the on field decision. England take the chance to kick from 10 metres. Makinson makes no mistake.      4.08pm    66 mins: As previously mentioned, Samoa look a little tired. England are backed by an increasingly raucous crowd. This should be a fun final 14 minutes.      4.06pm   TRY! England 18-20 Samoa (Farnworth, 64)  Williams thinks he has broken the line but fingertips hold him back. Welsby kicks for the corner, it looks to hit the whitewash and bounces back for Bateman to ground but it is ruled out. Instead we go back to an earlier penalty for offside. We go back to England starting a set of six from the 20 metre line. England are driving at this tired defence with power. Farnworth gets the ball on the left and bulldozes through a line of three men in blue to touch down. Makinson does the rest. GAME ON!   Updated at 4.13pm GMT    4.01pm    62 mins: Samoa lose the ball in the tackle, England pick it up, allowing Young to race for the line from 40 metres but a plethora of blue shirts drag him down. Williams sends an early grubber through but Whitehead is not a footballer and he can\u2019t control it, resulting in To\u2019o grabbing hold in the in goal area.      3.59pm    61 mins: England are showing far more intent after going eight points behind. They are quick at the play of the ball. The kick on the the play final tackle goes dead. Away from that, however, Tomkins and a few Samoans are going at it. Luai has a word with Tomkins, who gives him a friendly tap on the head, resulting in the Samoan losing it and chasing him down for a push and shove. The referee gets involved and tells them both to be less childish.  Updated at 3.59pm GMT    3.56pm    60 mins: Samoa are on the front foot and England really need to react but they are completely out of this game. That thrashing at St James\u2019 Park is certainly a long way away at this stage.      3.54pm   TRY! England 12-20 Samoa (Lafai, 57)  Samoa think they can kick a penalty for goal but it is a differential, meaning they cannot. It is a good job they have to have a set of six instead. They move the ball from left to right, and vice versa. Young misses a tackle on Luai, allowing him to play in Lafai to cross the whitewash. Once again, Wane is furious. Crichton drifts wide.   Updated at 4.00pm GMT    3.52pm    56 mins: Papali\u2019i almost breaks the line but is just about held up. The kick on the final tackle goes towards Young who allows the ball to slip between his fingers, much to Wane\u2019s chagrin, despite being under no pressure. The England head coach is furious.      3.50pm    54 mins: Samoa get inside the 10 on the final tackle but the kick from Milford is seized upon by Tomkins just in front of his own line.      3.48pm    52 mins: You\u2019d think England would have been buoyed by their own try but the wind might have been taken out of their sails. Samoan have come back at the them with great intensity and England really need to up their game if they are to win here.      3.46pm   TRY! England 12-16 Samoa (Crichton, 49)  Suaali\u2019i drives at Farnworth and gets the better of the England player, only for Whitehead to complete the tackle. Samoa move the ball quickly along the line and look to have a good chance but England recover. Luai sidesteps a couple of players before sending the ball to Paulo who offloads from the floor. There are some quick passes and Crichton collects to go over. What a try. The try scorer gets the extras.      3.41pm   TRY! England 12-10 Samoa (Bateman, 45)  England get inside the 10 and Cooper drives for the line but is held up under the posts. Whitehead tries to break the line but is taken down. The kick goes up on the final tackle and it looks an easy claim for Lafai but he drops it under pressure from Watkins, allowing Bateman to sweep in and touch down. Makinson pings the kick over.   Updated at 3.46pm GMT    3.38pm    44 mins: Scrappy stuff from England once again. Luckily for them To\u2019o fails to take the kick on the final tackle and England get to start again.      3.37pm    42 mins: Samoa are gifted a penalty at the halfway line. They get within a few minutes of the line but Suaali\u2019i is held up. On the final tackle they go for a kick but it achieves little, although they keep hold of the ball. They have an overload on the right but Makinson pounces when the ball goes loose.      3.34pm   Second half  Here we go again!      3.33pm    There are some decent sections without many people in inside the Emirates, which is a shame. The teams are on their way back.     3.21pm    Sam Tomkins: \u201cWe have put ourselves under some unnecessary pressure. We had some good positions but didn\u2019t do much with it. \u201cWe need to get back to how we\u2019ve been playing for the past five weeks. This is easily our worst performance.\u201d     3.19pm   Half time: England 6-10 Samoa  Samoa have been impressive with ball in hand and are making a slightly below par England work incredibly hard. England will be furious with themselves for failing to score a point during the 10-minute spell when they had a man advantage.      3.17pm    38 mins: Luai throws to Su\u2019a, who thinks he is through but a fantastic tackle stops him in his tracks. Samoa aim a kick through but Tomkins reads it and ensures it goes beyond the dead ball line. England will be the more eager to get to half time with the scores the same.      3.14pm    36 mins: Bateman fails to catch a pass but it is adjudged the ball has gone backwards. A kick goes up to the corner for England to chase but Suaali\u2019i backs the bounce of the ball, and thankfully for the Samoa is bounces out of play. A risky tactic that pays off.      3.13pm    34 mins: Samoa are really pounding through the middle against England and they tournament hosts are struggling to cope with it.     3.11pm   TRY! England 6-10 Samoa (Sao, 31)  Radley puts in a big hit on Suaali\u2019i as part of Samoa\u2019s plan to go straight down the middle. The ball goes out to the left where Sao does Watkins with a dummy and takes advantage of the gap and dives over the line. Crichton adds the extras from the left touchline.      3.09pm    30 mins: It is all happening in the corner. A big kick goes up which Samoa fail to do with and it looks like Young will collect and run it over the line but he kicks it straight out. England get a penalty for a shoulder off the ball on Young, putting England in a great position but they fail to make anything of it.     3.07pm    28 mins: Thompson comes on and immediately loses his boot in a tackle. Welcome to the game.  Samoa put together an decent set of six that concludes with a looping kick from Milford that Tomkins gobbles up. Brown has failed his HIA assessment, while Kaufusi is yet to complete his.      3.04pm   TRY! England 6-4 Samoa (Whitehead, 25)  There is no doubt about this one. It is fantastic work from Williams who breaks through two Samoans thanks to a clever dummy before offloading to Whitehead to do the rest. Makinson adds the extra points.   Updated at 3.08pm GMT    3.02pm    24 mins: Makinson again takes a long kick inside his own 10 and decides to run it across the line but defeats a few outstretched hands to make a few metres, even if it took him to run 50 metres sideways to make it.     3.00pm    22 mins: I think we can rule out England scoring 60 points today. Tomkins kicks through for Farnworth to chase but the ball bounces off him and Samoa collect it.  Paulo is back on with England still pointless. He will be a relieved man.      2.57pm    20 mins: NO TRY! England take their first tackle on the 10 metre line. The ball is worked out to the right where Watkins is waiting, he drives for the line with Lafai holding onto him, he goes over but loses control of the ball. You cannot do that at this level.      2.54pm    18 mins: Makinson takes a great catch on the Samoan final tackle but it is very much inside his own 20. England complete their set of six with a good kick and chase but Suaali\u2019i still manages to take control.      2.52pm    16 mins: Makinson escapes the a tackle but he leaves Brown on the deck after clashing heads with a teammate. He looks to be in a bad way. He is lifted to his feet and will need a Head Injury Assessment.  Kaufusi also has to go off, too, for a HIA. This is a tricky stage for Samoa.     2.49pm    14 mins: A huge 10 minutes for England here. They need to get some points on the board while they have the one-man advantage. England get another penalty and go for the try but Williams sends an early pass wide but it is a looping effort that is intercepted.      2.47pm    12 mins: Samoa are slowing England down at the play of the ball. They speed things up with a few quick offloads in succession until Williams is tackled out of play. Turns out Samoan have knocked on and England get it back.  Penalty to England after Paulo puts down Burgess on his neck, resulting in Paulo being sin binned for 10 minutes.      2.43pm    10 mins: Young catches a high kick inside his own 10, making it a tough set of six for England. The kick on the fifth from Tomkins is from deep and Samoa snaffle it up, allowing them plenty of room to bring it back up field without pressure.  Samoa are putting their bodies on the line in attack and defence.      2.41pm    8 mins: England are behind for the first time in the World Cup. They will want to get back at Samoa quickly.      2.40pm   TRY! England 0-4 Samoa (Lafai, 6)  What a start for Samoa! They get a second set of six on the halfway line. Suaali\u2019i finds a gap at the 20 metre line and is taken down. On the next tackle, Luai finds Lafai who does Watkins for speed and grounds the ball. Crichton misses his kick.   Updated at 2.44pm GMT    2.37pm    4 mins: Milford sends a kick out on the full, too. Samoa\u2019s kicking game looks a little off.  England complete a set of six with a high Williams kick that is caught by Suaali\u2019I inside his own 10.      2.35pm    2 mins: The kick-off is sent straight out of play, allowing England to take the ball back up to the halfway. A bad start for Samoa.  Williams looked set to go over but a last-ditch tackle prevents him. The next tackle sees a kick go up, Makinson goes to collect it in the corner but cannot take control of the ball and it bounces out of play. A lively start.     2.33pm   Kick-off  Here we go!     2.28pm    The Samoan anthem is sung a capella and it gets an emotional reaction in the stands.     2.22pm    The sun is out in north London but the crowd looks impressively sparse at the moment. Hopefully they are all waiting on the concourse.   Updated at 2.32pm GMT    2.20pm    The teams are in the tunnel \u2026     2.17pm    Shaun Wane: \u201cThey were under done [in the opening game], that\u2019s no doubt about that. They are better than they showed that day. We have improved as well. \u201cThey have talked all week about how physical they will be. We are English and we won\u2019t back down.\u201d     2.15pm    A Rugby League World Cup camp sounds fun.      2.09pm    \u201cReally looking forward to today\u2019s game,\u201d says Richard Wilson. \u201cFingers crossed we get the dream final I was hoping for when I booked my tickets for Old Trafford with 200 days to go. \u201cI think this is England\u2019s strongest 17 on paper and they will hopefully take the battle to Samoa up front. Having said that, I\u2019ve been impressed by England\u2019s strength across the pitch this tournament but I don\u2019t think they\u2019ve put in a full 80 minute performance.\u201d \u201cCould they be peaking in time for next week?!\u201d They will certainly need to be with Australia awaiting them.     2.06pm    When I was a teenager and called up to play for Salford, you\u2019d have hoped there would be a few of those players in the England squad today. Alas, absolutely none of them made it professionally and I was by far the worst.      2.02pm    A nice feature on Victor Radley is being shown on the BBC where they talk through his upbringing in Australia, his work in the building trade and his Yorkshire dad.     1.59pm    Easy? I don\u2019t think so.      1.52pm    England have averaged 60 points a game in this tournament. That is a sign of how well they are doing and what Samoa are up against.      1.48pm    Aaron Bower takes a look at what we can expect from this semi.      1.45pm   Samoa team  Samoa: Suaali\u2019i, To\u2019o, Crichton, Lafai, May, Luai, Milford, Hunt, Brown, Paulo, Sao, Su\u2019a, Kaufusi Replacements: Harris-Tavita, Papali\u2019i, Leniu, Tuilagi      1.39pm    Can this semi-final compete with last night\u2019s?       1.34pm   England team  England: Tomkins, Young, Watkins, Farnworth, Makinson, Welsby, Williams, Burgess, McIlorum, Hill, Whitehead, Bateman, Radley  Replacements: Knowles, Thompson, Cooper, McMeeken     1.30pm   Preamble  Here we are, back where it all began: England are playing Samoa at a Premier League football ground. On that day, at the start of the tournament, England racked up an impressive 60-6 triumph against one of the favourites to lay their down a marker. Samoa have since shown why some tipped them to go a long way with some impressive displays. They edged out Tonga in the quarter finals 20-18 and they know they will have to be better if they are to gain revenge against England. Shaun Wane\u2019s side have been unstoppable thus far. Papua New Guinea were brushed aside in their first knockout match after a breezy group stage. The challenge for England is to maintain the momentum they have collected. Apart from a brief lack of discipline against France, the standard of performances from England have been of the highest calibre. Awaiting the victors of today\u2019s game is Australia after their 16-14 triumph over rivals New Zealand at Elland Road last night. That game is being described as one of the greatest rugby league matches in history, so hopefully we will see more of the same. It should be a cracking encounter at the Emirates! Kick-off: 2.3opm GMT  "

                    "body": "One of Coventry\u2019s best-known historical figures is Lady Godiva who, as legend tells it, famously rode through the English city naked on horseback in protest at high taxes in the 11th century. On Friday night it was the Kangaroos who stormed through the town, fully dressed of course, and caught the eye as they slaughtered Scotland 84-0 in their second Rugby League World Cup match. It was a result never really in doubt in the wet West Midlands, considering the gulf between the defending World Cup holders and the minnow Bravehearts, who rely largely on lower league players of English and Antipodean heritage. The two countries have only ever played once before, back in the 2016 Four Nations in Hull, and that fixture ended in a similarly one-sided 54-12 victory.  But this time the damage was a lot more severe, with Australia piling on seven tries in the first half and eight more in the second. Nathan Cleary finished with a personal total of 28 points, with a try and 12 goals to his name, while Josh Addo-Carr claimed four tries and Campbell Graham notched a hat-trick. Coach Mal Meninga rang the changes before the game, handing debuts to Matt Burton, Graham, Cleary, Liam Martin, Isaah Yeo and Lindsay Collins. Considering the Kangaroos\u2019 back-up halfback at this point is Cleary, it is a strength in depth that Meninga\u2019s counterpart Nathan Graham could only dream of. Before the match kicked off a minute\u2019s silence was held for Redcliffe player Liam Hampson, who was found dead in Barcelona nightclub earlier this week. Hampson was traveling with several NRL players in Spain and is a friend of Kangaroos prop Patrick Cadigan. A poor start from Scotland at the sodden Coventry Building Society Arena, who accidentally took the ball into touch from the kick-off, set the tone. This handed Australia a set on the Scots\u2019 try-line, and almost a try after 70 seconds through a kick, but Alex Walker managed to ground the ball before Cleary could lay a hand on it. It took five minutes for the Kangaroos to open the scoring, as Cleary floated a ball out wide for Addo-Carr to score in the corner. The halfback could not add the extras from the sideline, but his team had poked ahead 4-0. It went to 8-0 six minutes later, when Jack Wighton brushed past some soft defence to touch down and the Penrith playmaker made no mistake this time, as the scoreboard started to move into overdrive. In the 15th minute Lachlan Walmsley spilled a Cleary bomb and Angus Crichton pounced for the third try. It was a point a minute as Cleary made it 16-0. The Panthers star\u2019s clinical kicking game was killing the Scots, with Matty Russell dropping one in the slippery conditions and forcing a drop-out. Then it was Graham, who would have been playing for Scotland at this World Cup through his Glaswegian father if not for a late call-up from Meninga, who barged over for Australia\u2019s fourth try. The Bravehearts started falling off more and more tackles, and soon it was Cleary who grabbed a soft try between the sticks before converting his own four-pointer. Four minutes later Addo-Carr secured his second, displaying his trademark pace, and then Wighton notched his own double thanks to Harry Grant\u2019s pass. It was 40-0 at half-time and the break came as blessed relief to Scotland. But the battering continued in the second half unabated, taking just 55 seconds for James Tedesco to cross.  Ben Hunt was the next to get on the scoreboard, running in off Cameron Munster\u2019s pass, before Addo-Carr secured his third of the night. Cleary kept the lead ticking over, as the Bravehearts\u2019 Kane Linnett was sin-binned for tackling Tedesco off the ball, with further tries coming to Burton, Yeo, Addo-Carr again and Graham twice. With a mammoth 28 points in his first-ever Kangaroos appearance, the key question now is whether Meninga sticks with Cleary against Italy and for the rest of the tournament as his first-choice halfback, or plumps for rival Daly Cherry-Evans. That is the only potential concern for the Australian boss on a rainy night of green and gold World Cup dominance."

                    "body": "In a parallel universe \u2013 say at Wembley or Molineux \u2013 Harry Maguire rumbles forward and keeps on going to the fringes of the penalty area. It is 0-0, half an hour gone and England are labouring.\nMaguire does not give the impression that he has the ball entirely under his spell. Or that he knows what he is going to do next. It is chaotically off the cuff. He simply puts his head down and shoots. It zings out for a throw-in on the far side.\nCue the derision? Because that is what Maguire tends to inspire in big crowds back in England. Not here. Not at the Ahmad bin Ali Stadium on Tuesday night in the final World Cup group game against Wales. Within seconds, the England fans behind the other goal have begun to sing Maguire\u2019s song, the one about his alcohol preferences and massive head.\n\nSpool forward to the interval. The game remains goalless, England error-strewn and predictable. Cue the boos? Because that is what tends to happen. England were jeered by the Wembley crowd at half-time in their opening Euro 2020 matches against Croatia and Scotland with the score at 0-0 and everyone remembers the vitriol at Molineux in June during the Nations League game against Hungary. That night, England were 1-0 down at the break. It would get much worse.\nAt the Ahmad bin Ali, there were no boos when the half-time whistle blew, no spontaneous outpouring of frustration. It seemed to reinforce a couple of developing themes for Gareth Southgate and his squad as they attempt to win the World Cup \u2013 next stop Senegal in the last 16 on Sunday night \u2013 with trust and patience central to them.\nPlaying at home can be a blessing and a curse for a national team, especially at a tournament. Remember Brazil at the 2014 World Cup? With 200 million deeply passionate people willing them on, the side were a sea of nerves and anxiety, riding the wave as far as the semi-final before they crashed against Germany.\n\nSouthgate has previously said there could be no greater pressure for his players than to have what was effectively a home tournament at the Euros, with all but one of their games at Wembley. The desperation of the supporters for glory can magnify the highs and drive a wild kind of momentum. It can accentuate the lows.\nIt is different in Qatar, more balanced. The profile of the travelling England fan feels different. Perhaps the alcohol situation is also a factor. No one seems to be fired-up drunk inside the stadiums. There were boos at the end of the 0-0 draw against the USA in the second group game but that was after the full-time whistle. It did not affect the performance. A half-time booing is harsher. It is a prejudgment.\nMaguire is feeding off the support. He positively bounded over to the England fans before kick-off against Wales, applauding them and getting plenty back. It is not to say that Maguire is not cheered at home or does not hear his song. Just that the bad stuff can overtake it there on a bad day. Over here, the supporters have embraced Maguire\u2019s cult-hero qualities. His size and physical toughness; the fun of him in full flight. He has had a good tournament so far.\n\nAs England eased to a 3-0 win over Wales in the second half, there was the chant to the tune of Jingle Bells about it being fun to see them win away. Christmas ditties during a World Cup? It is an unusual experience in so many ways.\n\u201cWe had fantastic support in the stadium,\u201d Southgate said. \u201cIt reminded me of tournaments I played in where you\u2019ve got that bank of fans and it\u2019s a very special feeling to run out and hear that.\u201d\nWednesday brought a day off for the England players, a time to reflect, and Southgate is happy at how phase one of the assignment has been completed. Nine goals, and they have been shared around; two clean sheets; group winners with seven points. The team spirit is excellent and Southgate\u2019s options run deep, especially for his front line.\nAgainst Wales, he was able to get minutes into Kyle Walker and Kalvin Phillips \u2013 as they work their way back after major operations \u2013 and control those of Luke Shaw, Declan Rice and Harry Kane, withdrawing them around the hour mark.\nMan-management is everything. Southgate has had to show compassion for Shaw, whose grandmother died before the opening game against Iran after a long time with cancer. \u201cShe was a really important part of my childhood \u2013 I spent a lot of time with her,\u201d Shaw said. \u201cYou could say she is part of my motivation.\u201d\nSouthgate\u2019s selection decisions have been difficult and they will only get more so. How to strike the right tone with those he omits? It was certainly a big call to leave out Raheem Sterling against Wales. Southgate has always started the Chelsea winger in tournaments \u2013 except the dead-rubber final group game against Belgium at the 2018 World Cup.\n\n\u201cRaheem\u2019s had two starts here and he\u2019s played at big clubs where you don\u2019t necessarily start every game,\u201d Southgate said. \u201cThe players understand that. Of course they are disappointed not to start but we\u2019ve got an incredible spirit among the group. They take that as well as you can expect. They\u2019ve got to be ready for when their moment comes.\u201d\nThe memory of England\u2019s first-half performance against Wales remains jarring; exhibit B for why they will not win the World Cup. Exhibit A had come from much of the 90 minutes against the USA. Southgate and some of the players pushed the idea that the largely sterile domination against Wales before the interval had served to wear their opponents out, setting up the second-half knockout blows. Maguire made a more irrefutable point. \u201cIf you watch a lot of the games here, they\u2019ve had really tense first halves,\u201d he said.\nThe England players can feel the excitement building, particularly when they see videos of the celebrations from home. \u201cIt\u2019s hard sometimes to stay calm,\u201d Phillips said. \u201cBut we have a good group and a good coaching staff who will always keep us grounded \u2013 especially Steve Holland.\u201d\n\nThat got a laugh. Southgate\u2019s assistant is surely more bad cop than the manager. But for a symbol of England\u2019s quiet assurance, look no further than Southgate\u2019s in-game demeanour. The manager has barely come out of his dugout, preferring to leave the players to it, to empower them.\n\u201cI got into a habit during Covid of standing on the touchline because you felt they needed more encouragement without the fans,\u201d Southgate said. \u201cBut I\u2019m happier biding my time and taking my moments. We\u2019ve also got the monitor where we can watch everything with a slight delay if things happen when you\u2019ve got to make tactical decisions. I don\u2019t need to be playing every ball with the players. I trust them.\u201d"

                    "body": "The fallout of a failed crusade led to Wiener Neustadt\u2019s creation in 1194 but England will remember it as the place where their World Cup qualifying mission was accomplished. Although the city\u2019s 3,000-capacity stadium, an hour\u2019s drive south of Vienna, seemed a slightly underwhelming setting for the Lionesses\u2019 first match since winning Euro 2022 in front of nearly 90,000 fans at Wembley in July, it was perhaps a fitting venue. A settlement built with the ransom money paid by the English to secure King Richard I\u2019s release after his capture by Duke Leopold of Austria as the Lionheart returned from a failed attempt to take Jerusalem certainly seemed an appropriate springboard for an impending attempt at global domination.  Winning next year\u2019s World Cup in Australia and New Zealand will not be easy but there is now a sense that, with Alessia Russo around to lead the attack, anything is possible. Russo\u2019s seventh-minute volley \u2013 her ninth goal in 14 senior appearances \u2013 swiftly blew a gaping hole through Austria\u2019s carefully constructed rearguard. Although they subsequently gave England a few frights, the defence held firm. The somewhat strange presence of a giant pink water slide behind one of the stands \u2013 the stadium is situated next to an aqua park \u2013 lent a pre-season feel to the occasion, and the understandable lack of on\u2011pitch sharpness during the first half in particular made it seem more like a friendly than a key qualifier. Granted, Sarina Wiegman\u2019s decision to start Lauren Hemp on the right wing and Beth Mead on the left rather than in their customary positions on the opposite sides was arguably misguided, but England could not have been expected to be at their best 34 days after beating Germany in the Euro 2022 final and with the Women\u2019s Super League not starting until next week. Austria were losing quarter-finalists to Germany in that tournament but they too are in their domestic pre-season and did not resemble the cohesive counterattacking unit that suffered two narrow 1-0 defeats to England in the past 10 months, in this qualifying group and at the Euros.  Even so, they very nearly equalised at the outset of the second half when Julia Hickelsberger was inches away from capitalising on Mary Earps\u2019s rare loss of concentration. Heeding that warning, England finally began forcing the tempo and rediscovering a menacing one- and two-touch passing rhythm. Those children who deliberately halted their descent through the water slide in order to take in the action were treated to the sight of the Austria goalkeeper, Manuela Zinsberger, saving smartly with her legs from Georgia Stanway after Russo\u2019s adroit chesting down of a high ball. In between increased England pressure Earps atoned for her earlier lapse in concentration by showing off tremendous footwork as she seamlessly changed direction to divert Laura Feiersinger\u2019s dangerously curving shot to safety.  By now there was no suspicion England had overindulged on the beautifully iced cake rather touchingly presented to their manager by Austrian officials before kick-off. Indeed, the only shame was that only 2,600 fans \u2013 including 28 who had travelled from the UK \u2013 were present to watch Nikita Parris lash a second goal into the roof of the net eight minutes after she and England replaced Russo and Mead. Once a mainstay of England\u2019s attack, Parris rather lost her way during recent stints with Lyon and Arsenal. Happily, her latest move, to Russo\u2019s Manchester United, promises to revive a forward who could yet benefit from the retirement of the Lionesses\u2019 record goalscorer, Ellen White. Whatever the future holds, Parris\u2019s timely reminder of her latterly hibernating talent made it a perfect anniversary for Wiegman, ensuring that, almost a year to the week since taking charge of England, the Dutchwoman presided over a 19th win in 21 games. Given the Lionesses are yet to lose on her watch and have scored 108 goals while conceding five, no team will want to be placed in their group when October\u2019s World Cup draw in Auckland serves as the starting gun for England\u2019s next campaign."

                    "body": "Not content with one jaw-dropping shock in Group E, Japan managed a second in feverish conditions to beat a multitalented Spain side and claim another place for Asia in the last 16 of this increasingly unpredictable World Cup.\nTwo goals in three minutes just after half-time \u2013 one that was scored by the very finest of margins \u2013 shocked Spain cold, taking their metronomic rhythms and throwing them into a bin bag that was then politely disposed of. The Europeans still qualified for the knockout stages, in second place on goal difference ahead of Germany, but if this was a deliberate attempt to choose an easier path through the draw, nobody told that to their shellshocked players.\n\nFor Japan this was a landmark achievement, not so much for the fact of qualifying \u2013 it is their third round of 16 in the last four World Cups \u2013 but for the manner with which they did it. A narrow defeat by Costa Rica was sandwiched by victories over two European powerhouses, the world champions of 2010 and 2014. The players remained on the pitch for a long period after the stands of the Khalifa International Stadium had begun to empty, soaking up the moment with ebullient travelling fans and a crowd of photographers.\nStatistics show that Japan averaged possession of just 18% over the course of 90 minutes and they completed 175 passes to Spain\u2019s 991. But in the brief evisceration that occurred shortly after half-time, Japan deservedly won the match. For all of Spain\u2019s technical control, much of it beautiful to watch, they did not do enough to affect the match. Spain now go on to face a well-organised Morocco side, who finished top of Group F. Japan will play Croatia.\n\nSpain dominated from the off and scored early. Forced back into a flat, nervous-looking back five, Japan were unable to close the spaces around their penalty area and after Gavi had seen a low cross half-cleared in the 12th minute, Nico Williams worked it back to C\u00e9sar Azpilicueta on the edge of the box. His cross was looped and precise, finding \u00c1lvaro Morata on the penalty spot. He buried a header back across Shuichi Gonda for his third goal of the tournament.\nThe teenaged Gavi, alongside his 20-year-old Barcelona partner Pedri, were the stars of the first half, orbiting around their midfield anchor Sergio Busquets with a trajectory hidden from their opponents. Spain\u2019s only enemy in the opening 45 minutes was themselves, the propensity for coughing up possession as they built from defence a trend that had continued from the Germany game.\n\nJapan went into the interval a goal down but, in the mind of their coach, Hajime Moriyasu, the plan was working. He made a double substitution at the break and both Brighton\u2019s Kaoru Mitoma and Ritsu Doan of Freiburg were instrumental in changing the match.\nAn already aggressive Japanese press increased in intensity the moment the second half whistle blew and the Spaniards\u2019 achilles heel was evident three minutes after the restart. A jittery Sim\u00f3n played a loose pass out to the left-back Alejandro Balde, who was unable to clear before Doan was upon him.\nThe midfielder descended on to the box and unleashed a shot with all the power he could muster, which was way more than Sim\u00f3n could handle as the keeper palmed the ball into the roof of his net.\n\nThe atmosphere in the stadium kicked up a notch immediately and before anyone had a chance to catch their breath Japan \u2013 who had looked set for a hiding just minutes before \u2013 were in front. Again it was Doan who made it, again bulldozing his way past a now bewildered Balde and crossing to the left-hand side where Mitoma cut the ball back for Ao Tanaka to bundle home.\nJapan\u2019s players were delirious, their subs on the pitch, only for the goal to be ruled out; the ball had apparently gone out of play as Mitoma kicked it. The gods of VAR then deliberated \u2013 aided by the positional sensor in the Al Rihla ball \u2013 and they found the goal was good. It had stayed in by fractions, and Japanese fancy dress headscarves were coming off in disbelief.\\\n\nA flurry of substitutions for both sides followed, with Morata and Gavi withdrawn for Spain, but gone altogether was the Spanish composure as suddenly, ludicrously, they faced the possibility of elimination. For a minute or two it was even a reality, when Costa Rica took a brief lead against Germany. Luis Enrique said he would have had a heart attack had he realised.\nMarco Asensio and Dani Olmo had opportunities for an equaliser blocked and saved, but Japan had the clearest chance to score when Mitoma played Takuma Asano clear through on goal, only for the substitute to slip and scoop his shot. Japan managed to channel the same determination that had seen them over the line against Germany and, when the final whistle came, all was bedlam."

                    "body": "It felt a little like a bride walking down the aisle on her special day, only for her dearly beloved to be staring at the reams of toilet paper that were stuck to her shoes. After all the hype and expectation, it wasn\u2019t meant to be like this. A must-win game against our next door neighbours, to stand any chance of progression in our first World Cup for 64 years. Wales 0 England 3. Is this the way the future\u2019s meant to feel?\nUnlike the writers in some other newspapers, I am able to experience two emotions at once, with neither being anger. Enormous pride that we qualified. Incredible disappointment that we are going home. But it is disappointment with context. It is far better to get knocked out of a World Cup than not to get to one in the first place. What was so frustrating about the great qualification failures of my time as a supporter \u2013 Euro 92, USA 94, Euro 2004 and Russia 2018 \u2013 was the feeling of unfinished business, a cosmic unfairness that prevented footballers who were good enough to play on the biggest stage from doing so.\nOn the BBC Gary Lineker asked Ian Rush what the younger members of the Wales squad will have learned from Qatar. After talking briefly about the atmosphere, Rush said: \u201cI don\u2019t know, I never played at a World Cup.\u201d Rush scored 346 career goals for Liverpool, won the European Cup and European Golden Boot, and yet failed at the final hurdle for his country. Tuesday night has to be better than that.\n\nFor a team that have taken the supporters to such uncharted territory \u2013 qualification for three of the past four tournaments, a Euros semi-final and a World Cup playoff win \u2013 there is the foreboding sense of an era coming to a close. It won\u2019t be as dramatic a rebuild as under John Toshack, when the senior members of Mark Hughes\u2019s team retired en masse, seven within months of Toshack\u2019s appointment. In those days Toshack would wearily tell the press that it wasn\u2019t the current qualification campaign that was important for his team of teenagers, or the next one, but the next one. It seemed to be a race against time \u2013 could Wales qualify before the government banned diesel cars? Could we qualify before driverless cars?\nThe team will know better than anyone that they underperformed. Too few of our important squad members are playing regularly for their clubs, or they are carrying injuries into a tournament where the slightest inadequacy is brutally exposed. Tactical errors were made. Away from the comforting emotional churn of the Cardiff City Stadium, a ground where over the past eight years Wales have almost forgotten how to lose, in Qatar they looked as if they had forgotten how to win. Charged with being ambassadors for a country undergoing the catharsis of qualification as well as being footballers competing under the harshest of spotlights, the frustration of putting in three of the worst Wales performances since the age of BlackBerry messenger will live with these players for a lifetime.\n\nBecause unlike some Wales teams of the past, no one can accuse them of not being committed. The supporters stayed at the Ahmad bin Ali Stadium on Tuesday night to show their appreciation for a group of men who have taken us to places we never thought we\u2019d go. So many of our previous World Cup qualification campaigns were over by the third game, at which point attending matches became a chore, before it became an afterthought, to an irrelevance.\n\nBut this team have commanded centre stage for so long that it\u2019s difficult to imagine a return to the fallow periods of the past. Thankfully, we have 146 years of history to guard us from this complacency. Being below Haiti and North Korea in the Fifa rankings is part of our story. Losing 7-1 against the Netherlands, in a game where extraordinarily the goalkeeper Neville Southall was man of the match, has shaped our expectations. The Football Association of Wales was unable to afford an under-21s team for six and a half years in the 1980s. Tuesday night was definitely better than that.\nUltimately, this tournament will be remembered for what happened off the pitch, as opposed to on it. Seeing Wales shirts on sale at Doha airport. The primary school girl from Cardiff who said: \u201cMate, I\u2019m fuming about this,\u201d when asked by Channel 4 for her reaction to the result against Iran. Singing with supporters from other countries in scenes that felt reminiscent of those Fifa corporate videos that are mocked by everyone apart from the execs who signed them off. The new, unfamiliar feeling that we\u2019d been invited to the party, as opposed to staring at the revelry on tiptoes with our noses pressed against the window. None of this can mask meagre performances. But it does explain why the players were sung, rather than booed, off the pitch.\n\nFootballers often process defeat differently to supporters, the experience of feeling second best on the field contrasting with the helplessness experienced from the stands. The players are a conduit for our jubilation, but for too long Wales fans had to make their own fun as we were let down by sides who weren\u2019t good enough. Aside from the hosts Qatar, Wales was the smallest nation at this World Cup, although Uruguay are not far behind. Croatia and Denmark have proven how small countries can consistently punch above their weight at international level. Following their example must now be the ambition.\nGareth Bale confirmed that Tuesday night wouldn\u2019t be his final game in a Wales shirt, and mentioned the connection with the supporters. Social media was full of fans planning the trip to Croatia in March for the first game of our Euro 2024 qualification campaign. Wales away has always been about more than the football. Qualification to a World Cup was always about more than the football. I never thought I\u2019d see a player as good as Rush, and then Ryan Giggs came along. I never thought I\u2019d see a better player than Giggs, and then Bale was beamed down from space. Until our next superstar arrives, a fanbase now used to success may have to be patient. Yma o Hyd.\nElis James has donated his fee for this column to Amnesty International, which is campaigning for Qatar and Fifa to establish a compensation fund for migrant workers."

On Saturday the Socceroos rescued their Qatar 2022 campaign, beating Tunisia 1-0 to atone for their 4-1 tournament-opening loss to France. But, as Graham Arnold said after Saturday\u2019s historic win, they haven\u2019t \u201cdone nothing\u201d yet.  Denmark now await in the third and final group match, which will decide their fate. For the first time in a long time their chances of making the round of 16 are in their own hands. Yet there are still permutations to unpack. In keeping with World Cup tradition in place to avoid unfair advantage, the final fixtures of each group will kick off simultaneously. France, the defending champions, have confirmed they will finish at the top of Group D. Here\u2019s what you need to know about Australia\u2019s fight for second. Group D as it stands (points and goal difference) France: 6 (+4) Australia: 3 (-2) Denmark: 1 (-1) Tunisia: 1 (-1) The fixtures (both Thursday 2am AEDT) Tunisia v France Australia v Denmark If the Socceroos win They are through to the round of 16. This is the simplest equation and the one that offers surety regardless of the other result. A defeat of Denmark, coupled with their win over Tunisia, would give Australia a total of six points. That means they would qualify as the second-placed finisher in the group behind France, who have already sealed their progression thanks to their two wins. If the Socceroos draw This is more complicated. A draw \u2013 which would give them a total of four points and leave Denmark on two \u2013 could well do the trick. But Tunisia could make life difficult by beating France, which would bring the Tunisians level with Australia on four points but with a superior goal difference (this is why conceding four goals against France matters). By virtue of the goal difference, Tunisia would advance and the Socceroos finish third. On paper, France should be all over Tunisia. But Didier Deschamps could rest his best players in preparation for their first knockout match. Watch this space. If the Socceroos lose This is decidedly less complicated. A defeat would end their campaign. Denmark would increase their tally to four points and leapfrog Australia."

                    "body": "Rob Page has conceded he is treating Joe Allen as a special case after naming him in his squad for Wales\u2019s first World Cup in 64 years and admitted that Gareth Bale\u2019s fitness for the finals remains the \u201cmillion-dollar question\u201d.\nBy the time Wales play USA in their Group B opener Allen will not have played a competitive game for more than two months but Page is giving the Swansea midfielder every chance of being fit for their first game in Qatar and never entertained the idea of not selecting the 32-year-old because of his invaluable experience.\n\nAllen, who last month visited a specialist about his hamstring complaint, has been named in the 26-man squad that will be captained by Bale, who recently scored a crucial extra\u2011time equaliser to help Los Angeles FC to their first Major League Soccer title.\nPage admitted that whether Bale, who is yet to complete 90 minutes since moving to the MLS in June, has the fitness to play three games in nine days is a key issue facing Wales in Qatar.\n\nWales begin their tournament against USA on 21 November before matches against Iran and then England. \u201cHas he played as many minutes as we\u2019d like? Probably not,\u201d Page said of Bale. \u201cBut that doesn\u2019t worry me. He\u2019s proved time and time again when he puts the Welsh jersey on, irrespective of how many minutes he\u2019s played at domestic level, he\u2019s always produced.\n\u201cOn big occasions he\u2019ll always turn up, thrive, and enjoy it. He\u2019s already with the [Wales] staff, over in the country and raring to go. Gareth has proven in the past that without minutes he can deliver in important stages.\u201d\nOf Allen, Page said: \u201cWe\u2019re giving him every opportunity to be fit for that first game. He\u2019s progressing as we want him to. If he\u2019s fit, he\u2019s playing. He\u2019s massive for how I play and the success we\u2019ve had. He\u2019s a senior lad, he\u2019s got vast amounts of experience playing tournament football as well so he knows the game inside out and that\u2019s invaluable. That\u2019s why I\u2019m throwing everything at it.\n\u201cIt\u2019s similar to Joe Ledley probably at [Euro] 2016, when Cookie [Chris Coleman] had that scenario with an experienced lad that he wanted to go in, because he needed him as a key figure in that team. For me, it\u2019s no different with Joe [Allen].\u201d\nPage had always maintained there would be few shocks in his squad. The Luton defender Tom Lockyer, whose last Wales appearance came against Finland in September 2021, has been recalled to the squad in place of the injured Rhys Norrington-Davies.\nThere is no place for the in-form Swansea winger Oli Cooper or the Rangers forward Rabbi Matondo, who also missed out on a place at the European Championship last year. Chris Gunter and Jonny Williams, who play in League Two for AFC Wimbledon and Swindon respectively, have both been included.\n\nPage announced his squad at Tylorstown Welfare Hall, the last surviving coal miners\u2019 hall in the Rhondda valley, around the corner from the manager\u2019s childhood home, where his parents still reside. This was in contrast to the USA, who lit up the Empire State Building in red, white and blue in preparation for their squad announcement. \u201cIt is a world away from lighting up the Empire State Building,\u201d Page said, speaking in a building that used to be his old snooker hall.\nOn Wednesday morning, Page went for breakfast with his father in nearby Pentre, the birthplace of Jimmy Murphy, Wales\u2019s manager at the 1958 World Cup, before visiting the blue plaque on the outside Murphy\u2019s old house on Treharne Street.\n\u201cI haven\u2019t been back for a few years and to come back to Tylorstown, where I grew up, and share it with the family is really, really special,\u201d Page said. \u201cIt means the world to me and the people of the Rhondda as well.\u201d"

                    "body": "Risking players short on fitness or injured Gareth Southgate is not a fan of the 26-man tournament squad, believing it is more difficult to manage. And yet there is an upside. It allows him to include one or two players who have been out with injury and may not be ready to feature in the early ties. Before the European Championship in the summer of last year, which England kicked off on 13 June, Harry Maguire had been out with ankle ligament damage since 9 May and Jordan Henderson was only just coming back from the groin operation he underwent in late February. Southgate selected them both and it paid off handsomely in the case of Maguire, who missed the opening two group games but ended up in the team of the tournament. This time, Southgate has decisions to make over Kalvin Phillips and Kyle Walker \u2013 likely starters under normal circumstances. Phillips was named on the Manchester City bench on Wednesday night for the Carabao Cup tie against Chelsea, his first such involvement since undergoing shoulder surgery towards the end of September and came on after 50 minutes. His minutes total for the season before the game stood at 14. Walker, meanwhile, is behind him in terms of a comeback date after groin surgery on 4 October, although Pep Guardiola says Walker \u201cfeels really good\u201d. Both are expected to receive good news from Southgate. There is sadly no decision to make on Reece James, another key player, who has not played since injuring a knee for Chelsea on 11 October. He is simply too far away from fitness. Chilwell\u2019s absence to open door to another defender Poor Ben Chilwell. The Euros were a disaster for him on a personal level as he failed to appear and now he is out of the World Cup, having injured a hamstring for Chelsea last Wednesday. The good news for Southgate is that Luke Shaw, his first-choice left-back or left wing\u2011back, has rediscovered his form after a poor start to the season but where is the cover for him with Chilwell out? Most likely from Kieran Trippier, although, with James out and the uncertainty over Walker, the Newcastle player is in line to start on the right. Southgate considers Trippier to be ahead of Trent Alexander-Arnold. Could the manager call up a back-up left\u2011back, say Tyrick Mitchell or even the uncapped Ryan Sessegnon? Kyle Walker-Peters and James Justin, who can both play on the left, are injured. More likely is that he further bolsters the right side to free up Trippier to switch, which would bring into the equation Ben White, who is ahead of Joe Gomez in Southgate\u2019s thinking. White is expected to be selected and would offer an option at centre-half, where Fikayo Tomori and Marc Gu\u00e9hi appear to be battling for a single place. Tomori seems to have the edge, despite his poor performances in Milan\u2019s high\u2011profile Champions League defeats against Chelsea.  Is it time for Rashford? It was easy to worry that Marcus Rashford was finished last season. The Manchester United forward felt his confidence crash and it was pretty painful to watch him at times. Southgate dropped him for the friendlies against Switzerland and Ivory Coast in March and he noted a little pointedly that Rashford had pulled out of six of the previous eight squads. Rashford\u2019s last England appearance came in the defeat by Italy at the Euro final when he missed his penalty shootout kick. But he has been much better for United this season, playing with the pace and intent of old and scoring seven goals \u2013 even if his finishing has not always been lethal. Southgate selected Rashford for the 2018 World Cup. The player\u2019s pedigree, which takes in 12 England goals, is a part of his appeal and it would be a big surprise if Southgate did not recall him.  The battle to understudy Kane Rashford is a part of this and so, too, are Tammy Abraham, Ivan Toney and Callum Wilson. Southgate talks of having a batting order in each position, the sense being that if somebody is unavailable or drops off, he automatically moves to the next man down and it really takes something to disrupt what is a carefully calculated hierarchy. All of which is to say that Abraham appears to be in possession of a squad place up front, having been consistently called up since October of last year. And yet Southgate has been troubled by how he did not take his chance when he started the Nations League game against Italy in June (did anybody?) and the fact that he has scored only three goals for Roma this season. Toney won a first call-up for the internationals in September but Southgate did not give him his debut and it has left Wilson, who has been in eye-catching form for Newcastle, hopeful of timing a late run to perfection. Wilson won the last of his four caps in October 2019. Is there room for a wildcard? The short answer is probably not. James Maddison has shown his class for Leicester this season and delivered the goods (six goals, four assists in 12 Premier League games) to emerge as a cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre. But Southgate has overlooked the creative midfielder since giving him his only cap in November 2019. Ruben Loftus-Cheek, in assured touch for Chelsea and a veteran of the squad from the last World Cup, has pushed his claim but it seems that it has not been enough. It could also be that the West Ham winger Jarrod Bowen is squeezed out."

                    "body": "It is late afternoon in Al Wakrah and as Kalvin Phillips discusses crossing his fingers to recover from shoulder surgery in time for the World Cup in a Bedouin-style tent at England\u2019s training base it seems apt that the call to prayer for the Maghrib Salah seeps into conversation. In weeks gone by the only call Phillips, who has played just four minutes in the Premier League this season, had been praying for was from Gareth Southgate and before receiving confirmation of his place in the squad his anxiety was only heightened when Kyle Walker, his Manchester City teammate who has been sidelined since October, told of his inclusion earlier that morning.  Phillips has been limited to a total of almost 70 minutes across four appearances for City since a \u00a345m move from Leeds in the summer. \u201cI think Kyle had been told the day before me, so I walked in the gym, Kyle came to me and said: \u2018Ah, Gareth\u2019s just rung me and said I\u2019m involved in the World Cup,\u2019 and I was thinking: \u2018Well, if he\u2019s ringing all the injured players telling him they\u2019re involved, well why hadn\u2019t he rang me?\u2019 So there was a little bit of doubt that crept in,\u201d Phillips says. \u201cI got a phone call about 9.30am. I asked him how he was and he said: \u2018A lot better after seeing you play for 40 minutes\u2019 [against Chelsea in the Carabao Cup on 9 November] and then he told me that I was involved. I just said: \u2018Thanks a lot\u2019 and \u2018Thanks for including me, and thanks for believing in me.\u2019\u201dSouthgate was always going to give Phillips every chance of making the cut given his starring role at Euro 2020, where he started every game, including the final, playing all but 25 minutes of his first major tournament. Phillips won England\u2019s player of the year in 2020-21. \u201cIn the Euros I had a really \u2026 well, I had an alright tournament,\u201d he says, smiling. \u201cI spoke to Pep [Guardiola]. He didn\u2019t exactly force me to get the operation but said he felt it was the best thing to do to have the best chance to be involved in the World Cup. When Pep tells you something like that then you\u2019re not going to ignore it.\u201dPhillips first dislocated his shoulder at Leeds before suffering a recurrence in a pre-season friendly for City against Barcelona at Camp Nou in August. \u201cThe first time it popped out at Leeds it literally wouldn\u2019t go back in and that was like an hour\u2019s drive in the taxi to the hospital, so every bump that he [the driver] went over and every turn that it took, I was in agony,\u201d he recalls. After deciding to undergo surgery in September, Phillips at least felt in good hands, with his surgeon, Lennard Funk, having previously operated on Nick Pope.  It is clear Phillips, a self-deprecating character who previously likened his role at the base of midfield to a dog that chases whoever has the ball, is excited to be at his first World Cup, only 18 months after getting the man of the match award on his tournament debut against Croatia at Euro 2020. He looks in rude health \u2013 he says he is at about 95% fitness but could start against Iran on Monday if required \u2013 but why is his left flip-flop scissored and his foot cut? \u201cIt\u2019s quite a good story,\u201d he grins.He whittled what should have been a 12-week recovery period into seven-and-a-half weeks: gruelling double sessions, stints in the heat chamber, altitude training and hours on the bike. But his hard work could have been rendered redundant had he dropped anything heavier than a 5kg weight plate on his foot on the morning of City\u2019s final game before the World Cup break, a surprise stoppage-time defeat to Brentford, for which he was an unused substitute.\u201cBeing the professional that I am,\u201d he smiles, \u201cI went to the gym before the match and was just doing loads of Achilles work on the leg press. I\u2019d gone to pull a weight off the rack and there must have been one stuck behind it and [as] I pulled it off it landed straight on my foot and cut it all. But it is not too bad, it is the blisters from training [in Qatar] that hurt more \u2013 it isn\u2019t too bad but I stood for about 10 seconds and thought: \u2018Oh my god, what was that?\u2019 If it wasn\u2019t a 5kg plate, if it had been heavier, I think it would have been a lot worse.\u201dHas he been able to benefit from Guardiola\u2019s wisdom despite his stop-start beginning to life at City? \u201cI\u2019ve not been able to learn as much as I would like because of my injuries but from the first moment I walked in I was learning. The way Pep sees the game and wants his players to play was a massive eye-opener. When I got there I was confident in myself and in the first training session I was just like \u2018Woaaah\u2019 this is very, very different, this is very tough. But they are the best players in the world so I didn\u2019t have any regrets or doubts.\u201dPhillips is determined to seize his latest chance. The 26-year-old hopes his father, Mark, an inmate at Wealstun Prison, will be able to tune into his games. Congratulatory messages from old teachers at Farnley Academy, his secondary school in Leeds, and old coaches from Wortley Juniors, his first club three miles from Elland Road, flooded in, filtered via his twin sister, Deren, after news of his place in the squad spread. \u201cIt was very humbling for me as I came from a little area in Leeds, not a tough upbringing but had to work for everything that I got and just to get the call-up, after the eight weeks I had was a relief,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I knew the hard work was about to start.\u201d"

                    "body": "Denmark are braced for a Socceroos onslaught, with coach Kasper Hjulmand expecting \u201cthey\u2019ll run against us\u201d early and hard. The only question remaining is whose legs will be doing the running, as counterpart Graham Arnold pushed back a decision on the make-up of his starting XI until match day.\nIn the clearest indication yet that Australia are being taken seriously by World Cup opposition, Fifa\u2019s 10th-ranked nation are preparing to face \u201ca well-organised football team\u201d with both \u201cindividual and collective\u201d strengths when they meet to decide their fate on Wednesday night (Thursday 2am AEDT).\n\u201cThey have really some strengths in the team, individually but mostly as a team \u2013 just like we do,\u201d Hjulmand said on the eve of their final Group D match at Al Janoub Stadium. \u201cWe also define ourself as a very strong unit and a team that works very well together.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a well-organised football team with strength in the organisation and the way they work together. They attack together, they defend together, and they stick to a plan. They have some quality players with some strengths we have to be sure we are aware of, both with the young players but also the experienced players. We know this \u2013 we met them four years ago as well.\u201d\nThe difference between that 1-1 draw, also during the group stage of the 2018 World Cup, is that both teams were overseen by two different managers and Australia, at least, fielded an almost-unrecognisable team and only equalised via a penalty \u2013 with help from the VAR \u2013 to cancel out Christian Eriksen\u2019s opener.\nThe Socceroos scored two goals across their three matches in Russia and both were Mile Jedinak penalties. In Qatar they also have two goals, this time both from open play and of genuine quality.\n\nLike his predecessor Bert van Marwijk, Arnold\u2019s philosophy is rooted in pragmatic tendencies and a proclivity for counter-attacking, as evidenced in the build-up to Craig Goodwin\u2019s goal against France and Mitchell Duke\u2019s against Tunisia.\n\u201cMaybe,\u201d Hjulmand said, \u201cbut I think they\u2019ll come out strong against us. They won\u2019t just be sitting, I think they\u2019ll run against us. I think we\u2019ll be put under pressure. They\u2019ll try to get close to us in the duels.\n\u201cI see them also attack. They pass the ball very well in the beginning, and then they find some spaces and some pockets after duels that pick up the second ball, and they move forward and run forward. So I expect them to come out just like they did the last couple of matches, and that\u2019s very, very strong.\n\u201cWe should make sure that we have the positions and movement that will hurt the structures of Australia as much as possible, but I have great respect for the way they do [things].\u201d\nThe alteration in language around the Socceroos has shifted markedly since Saturday\u2019s landmark win over Tunisia. Arnold may not have been anticipating Hjulmand\u2019s complimentary words because, in his own pre-match press conference directly afterwards, he said Denmark under-appreciated Australia\u2019s quality.\n\u201cThere could be one thing they underestimate us on, and that is our quality,\u201d Arnold said. \u201cIt\u2019s not just about being fighting kangaroos or, you know, the Australians are just fighting all the time. It\u2019s also the quality that we can bring as a team as well.\u201d\nAs is so often the case in the final round of group games, the permutations play out live while both games take place concurrently. Third-placed Denmark\u2019s position is straightforward: they must beat second-placed Australia and hope last-placed Tunisia do not upset already-qualified France.\n\nThe Socceroos, however, can still progress via a draw but only if Tunisia do not defeat France. It is a gamble Arnold says he will not take \u2013 only a win will do \u2013 though both coaches will receive real-time updates on the score of the other fixture and have in the back of their mind what they must do.\nThe obvious blueprint for Australia is their own display against Tunisia: score early, protect the lead with their lives and put the onus on the opposition to play.\nHjulmand felt that would be \u201ca dangerous attitude\u201d. \u201cBecause they don\u2019t really know if they\u2019ve progressed with a draw,\u201d he said. \u201cSo I think they will come out very strong and try to have their periods where they put pressure on us as well.\n\u201cAnd, like all football games, there will be times where we have to break down a very strong defensive unit. They have been very close in their organisation, and the toughest thing in football is to break down an organisation like that.\u201d"

                    "body": "Louis van Gaal has accepted criticism of the Netherlands after the draw with Ecuador on Friday but has demanded respect for the 17-game unbeaten sequence since he took charge. If the Netherlands beat Qatar, who are already eliminated, in their final Group A match on Tuesday they are guaranteed to make the last 16, having claimed four points from their first two matches. After convincingly beating Senegal 2-0 in their opener they were flat in the 1-1 draw with Ecuador on Friday, conceding a late equaliser by Enner Valencia. Van Gaal, when was asked about the scrutiny the latest display received, said: \u201cI agree with the criticism but we are unbeaten for 17 matches and I think if you look at the goal difference too we deserve some respect.\u201d  The Netherlands have conceded only 14 times during that run, which began in August 2021, but Van Gaal brushed off the notion that his previous statement saying that they are at Qatar 2022 to win the World Cup could be counterproductive. \u201cI hope this is no pressure at all because always you have to identify the goal and if you don\u2019t identify the purposes and say the quarter-finals is enough you won\u2019t become world champions,\u201d the 71-year-old said. \u201cWe never said we will become world champions, I said we have a chance to become world champions and the players are convinced of that. If you want to become a world champion you will have to be capable of beating everyone.\u201d A noticeably relaxed Van Gaal made a joke when Frenkie de Jong was asked if he was in good health after it had been observed that the playmaker appeared a bit pale when sitting alongside the Dutch coach at the tournament media centre in Doha. \u201cThank you for saying Frenkie looks a bit pale because I\u2019ve seen that as well,\u201d Van Gaal said. \u201cThe rest of us have been lying at the poolside. Me not so much but my mother lay in her coffin with rosy cheeks when she died, it\u2019s a matter of genes.\u201d De Jong confirmed he is fine to face Qatar beyond having a sore throat and not being able to sleep well recently. Van Gaal, meanwhile, explained why he has confidence in Andries Noppert, the goalkeeper who made his debut against Ecuador despite having made only 32 Eredivisie appearances across six years. \u201cHe has a personality of which we feel that he wouldn\u2019t be very [overawed] by this World Cup, which is important,\u201d the coach said. \u201cWe assessed how he played in the last weeks to the World Cup \u2013 he was in good shape and the other argument, the other reason why we picked him, is that he can give the ball short in the build up which is what we want.\u201d Van Gaal, who recently had treatment for prostate cancer, came out of retirement to lead the Netherlands again and he suggested he may be open to offers beyond the tournament. \u201cIf we become world champions then the football world is a very opportunistic world. You never know,\u201d he said."

                    "body": "Marcus Rashford says he would volunteer to take a kick in a penalty shootout at the World Cup and is actively hoping the scenario arises, as he reflected on his remarkable comeback story.\nThe England forward missed in the shootout defeat against Italy in the Euro 2020 final and endured racist abuse on social media. He then laboured sorely at Manchester United last season, also losing his place in the England squad. \n\nInjuries were a factor; he underwent shoulder surgery in August of last year. But after a reset over the summer, when he pushed himself through a punishing fitness regime, he has recovered his form, scoring vital Premier League goals to earn the recall from Gareth Southgate.\nRashford scored within seconds of coming on as a substitute in England\u2019s 6-2 win against Iran in their World Cup opener \u2013 his first involvement since the penalty miss against Italy \u2013 and he is champing at the bit to feature in their final group-phase tie against Wales on Tuesday. \nRashford\u2019s confidence is back, as evidenced by his reply to the question about whether he would have any doubts over stepping up again in a shootout.\n\n\u201cNo, not at all,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are big moments and, as an individual, I\u2019ve always been comfortable with them. I enjoy being in big moments so I\u2019m hoping that we get to take another penalty in the tournament. I\u2019m looking forward to it.\u201d\nSouthgate introduced Rashford from the bench in England\u2019s second game \u2013 the 0-0 draw against the USA on Friday \u2013 playing him off the right, as he had done against Iran. Rashford prefers to play off the flanks but he would jump at the chance to start at centre-forward against Wales if Southgate chose to rest Harry Kane. England need only to avoid a four\u2011goal defeat in order to qualify and Kane has had a knock to the top of his foot.\n\u201cEveryone\u2019s ready and I\u2019m raring to go,\u201d Rashford said. \u201cWe are on the biggest stage in the world and it\u2019s an opportunity for all of us to go and take. I\u2019ve been on the bench but you\u2019re waiting for your opportunity. \n\u201cWe are not disjointed as a collective and, in tournament football, that is needed because it\u2019s going to be the squad that wins. It\u2019s impossible for us to win the tournament just off our starting players. There is a huge sense of togetherness and belief that we can go a long way.\u201d\n\nEngland were booed off by some fans after the USA game when the performance was flat. But Rashford offered a reminder that results had to be the priority. \u201cAs players, we always want to play our best football but it\u2019s not possible,\u201d he said.\n\u201cYou have to learn to win games when you\u2019re not playing well because it\u2019s unrealistic to think you\u2019re going to play your best every single game.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a nice feeling [to be booed] but you don\u2019t need fans to boo us to know we\u2019ve not played as well as we could have. It was a feeling that was mutual and it\u2019s not just the players that started, it\u2019s the full group.\n\u201cYou do sometimes question whether you would have changed things in the lead\u2011up to a game but that\u2019s natural because as players you want to win as many games as you can. We can\u2019t be so negative about it. We are in a good position and we just need to win against Wales. It\u2019s not often teams win all three group games.\u201d\n\nRashford won the first of his 48 caps under Roy Hodgson in May 2016 and he was involved at Euro 2016, which ended in the humiliating defeat against Iceland. Hodgson departed thereafter. Rashford said that Southgate had greatly improved the setup \u2013 beginning with the work on the training pitch.\n\u201cTraining\u2019s been good here for the lads who haven\u2019t been getting as many minutes,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I feel for this squad it\u2019s never been an issue, especially since Gareth\u2019s been managing. Maybe before it was a bit of an issue in terms of quality of training and people\u2019s dedication to training.\n\u201cI was only there for a short period of time before [Southgate] but the standard of training wasn\u2019t as high. For players it\u2019s black and white. If you aren\u2019t training well, you can\u2019t expect to play well or go into games and win just because you think you are better players. You have to put the work in and earn the right to win matches. For me it\u2019s two different sides of a coin. \n\u201cI don\u2019t think it takes a genius to see how we\u2019ve improved since 2016. You cannot really compare the two situations and you cannot compare the feeling around the camp. \nWe\u2019re a really strong team. We don\u2019t fear anybody. It\u2019s up to us to prove we have what it takes to win the World Cup. Do I believe we have? Yes.\u201d"

                    "body": "Yoshimi Yamashita, one of three women who will become the first female referees to officiate at a men\u2019s World Cup in Qatar, said on Thursday she hoped to inspire girls in the region to become match officials, but declined to comment on the host nation\u2019s poor record on gender equality. Asked whether she felt conflicted about refereeing in a country that has drawn criticism for its treatment of women and members of the LGBT+ community, Yamashita said the tournament could encourage a change in attitudes in Qatar and other parts of the region. \u201cThere are hardly any female referees in the Middle East, so I would like to see that change, with the Qatar World Cup as the catalyst. \u201cThe fact that women are officiating for the first time at a men\u2019s World Cup is a sign to other people that women\u2019s potential is always growing and that is something I also feel strongly about.\u201d  In a breakthrough for gender equality in football, Fifa announced in May that Yamashita, St\u00e9phanie Frappart of France and Rwanda\u2019s Salima Mukansanga were among 36 referees on the list for Qatar in November and December. In another first, they will be joined by Neuza Back of Brazil, Mexico\u2019s Karen D\u00edaz Medina and Kathryn Nesbitt from the US, who were named among 69 assistant referees for the tournament. \u201cI didn\u2019t think it would ever be possible to officiate men\u2019s games, so the World Cup wasn\u2019t in my thoughts,\u201d said Yamashita, who officiated at the 2019 Women\u2019s World Cup and last summer\u2019s Tokyo Olympics. Last year she became the first woman to referee a men\u2019s game in Japan\u2019s J-League and this year was the first to take charge of Asian Champions League games. \u201cAs a Japanese person and as a woman, I feel a great pride and responsibility on my shoulders, so I\u2019ll do my best at the World Cup.\u201d The 36-year-old would not be drawn on which matches she would like to officiate, but said she would take the same approach as she has since being registered as an international referee seven years ago. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say being a woman has been an advantage or a disadvantage,\u201d said Yamashita, 80 days before the tournament\u2019s opener between Qatar and Ecuador. \u201cI can honestly say that I have never received sexist abuse on the field because I am a woman. \u201cAnd as a referee, I don\u2019t see any difference between men\u2019s and women\u2019s football. I want it to be seen as perfectly normal for women to referee men\u2019s games, so what is happening in Qatar needs to continue. I feel a certain amount of pressure to win everyone\u2019s trust.\u201d Yamashita, whose first kickabout was with her elder brother when she was four years old, said she hoped the recent explosion in interest in women\u2019s football would extend to refereeing.\u201cI want to tell young girls who are interested in becoming referees that our potential is growing,\u201d she said. \u201cI am able to do what I do because I know there are girls who want to follow in my footsteps. I would say to them, don\u2019t feel anxious, just work very hard at what is right in front of you.\u201d"

The 18-year-old, who is the youngest Socceroo since Harry Kewell in 1996, has a fervent following at his home town of Shepparton in northern Victoria, where the community is gathering on Saturday night for the second group-stage match.  Agoness Kuol has watched her nephew grow up to play at the highest level, and she says his family and the South Sudanese community in Shepparton could not be prouder. \u201cHe makes us so happy. It makes us feel like we can fly, watching him play at the World Cup. And [we\u2019re] so happy for his parents, who worked so hard for this. \u201cHe has always, always loved playing football, since he was in kindergarten. But he\u2019s a good boy, he would come with us to church and would always stay with his family.\u201d The South Sudanese community has been growing in Shepparton, where just over 17% of the population were born overseas, compared with 12.4% for regional Victoria.  The communities have created spaces for themselves, including the South Sudanese community, which will host a viewing party of the next Socceroos match at St Paul\u2019s African House. Kuol says there will be food and dancing before the match, which begins at 9pm local time, and that the community is celebrating no matter the result. \u201cWe are a very connected community here. We\u2019re around 40 families and we all know each other. We all know Garang as well and we will be praying for him. \u201cHe\u2019s representing Australia, but also Shepparton and also South Sudan. He has three teams, three groups behind him. And we\u2019re all so proud of him.\u201d  Kuol was born in Egypt after his family fled Sudan. They moved to Australia as refugees before settling in Shepparton and becoming part of the fabric of the community there. Khadiga Abdalla will be cooking a series of traditional dishes for the viewing party at St Paul\u2019s African House. \u201cEveryone is very excited, we\u2019ve been working hard to prepare,\u201d she says. \u201cWe\u2019re always told we need more chairs, more food because more people are coming. But who knows what will happen in the match. \u201cSaturday night is for everyone \u2013 mums, dads, kids, we\u2019re all going to be there. No one would miss Garang at the World Cup.\u201d  Abdalla says her own children know Garang, making their pride in Garang\u2019s achievements all the more powerful. \u201cWe\u2019re all one family, together. My kids have been so excited, they didn\u2019t sleep for days before the last match, and they can\u2019t wait for the second one. \u201cHe\u2019s playing for all Australian and African kids.\u201d One of Kuol\u2019s early coaches at the Gosford Suns, Craig Carley, tells the Guardian that watching the youngster play at the World Cup gives him goosebumps. \u201cEvery single time I\u2019ve seen Garang on TV, it makes the hairs on my arm stand up, because I know how exciting he is. And I know how proud he has made people.  \u201cHe plays with no fear,\u201d Carley says. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t surprise me in the slightest what he\u2019s achieved \u2026 I know he can play at the highest level.\u201d Shepparton has been represented in the Socceroos before \u2013 by Robert Enes in the 1990s \u2013 but there hasn\u2019t been a player to break through the ranks from the town since.  Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup  Kuol\u2019s rise, which has now included being snapped up by English Premier League club Newcastle, has brought a sense of excitement to the town. \u201cWe pride ourselves on being the regional sporting capital of Australia,\u201d the Shepparton mayor, Shane Sali, says. \u201cAnd to have someone from our own backyard, who has grown up here playing in the junior ranks, and now on the international stage, is just something special.\u201d Sali is adamant Kuol should start Australia\u2019s second group game after coming off the bench in the loss to France on match-day one. \u201cFor them to win, he needs to start. You\u2019ve got to buy into the excitement he brings, and fingers crossed he starts a lot earlier. \u201cHe\u2019s a generational talent. Get him on early. We\u2019re all behind him.\u201d"

                    "body": "The first semi-final of the T20 World Cup throws together two teams whose experience of the competition so far could not have been more different. Where New Zealand\u2019s thumping victory over Australia in their opening game put them instantly in control of their group, Pakistan\u2019s presence in the final four, having lost their first two games to India and Zimbabwe, feels like a minor miracle. For the batter Shan Masood even playing in those games was extraordinary, given that during a net session before the first he was hit full on in the head by a vicious shot from Mohammad Nawaz. \u201cI took my helmet off, and I was walking across the nets to get some water, and then I heard someone saying, \u2018Watch out!\u2019 And before I could do anything I felt something hit my ear,\u201d he says. \u201cI went down, and my first thoughts were, it\u2019s hit me really hard. I thought at least it would be a fracture or something. I was taken to hospital, but when the scan came out it was just bruising.  \u201cNext day I was not allowed to partake in practice, but I passed every single concussion test, I was good to go. I did not have any practice before the game but I tried to reframe it. I said, \u2018look, anything could have happened. I could have been in hospital. I could have been back home. But I\u2019m actually here and I\u2019m playing, so savour the occasion, make the most of it.\u2019\u201d It was a spectacular occasion, in a sold-out and thrillingly noisy MCG. Masood scored a half-century but was so focused on his personal situation, and on his performance, that he barely took in anything else. \u201cI can remember certain bits of it, just seeing how big the stadium was, and that it was full,\u201d he says. \u201cI could tell there were a lot of Pakistani supporters.\u201d Pakistan scored 159 and for much of India\u2019s run chase looked certain to defend it. But an extraordinary innings from Virat Kohli, and an astonishing nine-ball, two-wicket, 16-run final over, turned the game on its head. \u201cIt took one of the best players to ever play the game to produce probably his best performance to take the game away from us,\u201d Masood says. \u201cThat speaks volumes for how the team played. But obviously a World Cup is squeaky bum time and it\u2019s about the result. We knew we played good cricket, but from then on we almost had to win every game.\u201d Instead they lost the verynext one, another extraordinary encounter, by a single run to Zimbabwe. \u201cWe actually thought because we played really good cricket against India, we were going to go into this game to express ourselves,\u201d Masood says. \u201cWhen the match was done it was disbelief, losing on the last ball again. And it takes a brave group, a group with character, to bounce back from there.\u201d Despite beating Netherlands and South Africa in their next two matches, the only way Pakistan could progress was to win their last game and for the Proteas to lose to the Dutch. That game was the first of a double-header in Adelaide, with Pakistan\u2019s against Bangladesh to follow. The South Africa game started at 10.30am. Masood followed the early overs on his phone, before the team travelled to the stadium. \u201cNormally when you get to the ground everyone is invested in their skills and their preparation,\u201d he says. \u201cA lot of guys will go to the nets, a lot will go outside, do their warm-ups, get ready. People will eat. But those that went to the nets came back, they just wanted to watch the game \u2013 and the game had gotten interesting.\u201d  Netherlands scored 158, and in their reply South Africa kept losing wickets. \u201cThere were all the different emotions that a game can put your through,\u201d Masood says. \u201cThe same game can be life-changing in a good way for someone, but it can be detrimental to someone else. We kept watching and it was unreal, it was disbelief, because I genuinely thought South Africa were one of the best teams in the tournament.\u201d South Africa lost by 13 runs and Pakistan seized their chance, beating Bangladesh with 11 balls to spare, Masood scoring the winning runs. \u201cThe biggest lesson for us has been, cricket\u2019s a great humbler, a great leveller,\u201d he says. \u201cDo not take anything for granted. \u201cWe were humbled in so many ways. We lost our first two games and now we are in the semi-finals there is nothing to boast about. It is more gratitude and relief that we have another chance. \u201cIt felt a bit, I never say unfair but it felt a bit weird that, yes, we made a couple of mistakes, we ended up losing two close games and we could have gone out without really getting a chance of redemption. Now we have that chance.\u201d"

                    "body": "Son Heung-min has declared he will be part of South Korea\u2019s World Cup squad but Sadio Man\u00e9\u2019s presence in Qatar is in doubt after Bayern Munich said the Senegal forward had sustained an injury to his right fibula. Son sustained a fracture around his left eye during Tottenham\u2019s game at Marseille last week and had surgery on Friday. The Spurs manager, Antonio Conte, said on Sunday he expected the 30-year-old to be fit for the World Cup and Son provided an update on Instagram on Wednesday. After saying he had \u201creceived a lot of strength\u201d from messages of support, he wrote: \u201cPlaying for your country at the World Cup is the dream of so many children growing up, just as it was one of mine too. I won\u2019t miss this for the world. I can\u2019t wait to represent our beautiful country.\u201d Son posted a message in Korean and one below in English and a section not translated into English raised the possibility that although he would be in the squad and fitted with a mask, it was not certain he would play. His status with South Korea is such that he will be part of the squad even if there is a doubt over his availability.  \u201cWhen I think of the masks you\u2019ve been patiently wearing for over two years, my mask that I\u2019ll be wearing at the World Cup matches is nothing,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIf there is only 1% chance, I will look at that possibility.\u201d Man\u00e9 is similarly important to Senegal. Bayern did not specify how serious his injury could be but said he would not be available to face Schalke on Saturday. Man\u00e9 was substituted against Werder Bremen on Tuesday and the initial word from the assistant coach Dino Toppm\u00f6ller was that it was \u201cnothing too serious and his participation in the World Cup should not be in jeopardy\u201d. But far less positive reports emerged on Wednesday, including that he was out of the World Cup, before Bayern said in a statement: \u201cFurther examinations will follow in the coming days. FC Bayern is also in contact with the medical staff of the Senegalese Football Association.\u201d "

                    "body": "If Graham Arnold was reaching for the panadol to deal with selection headaches back in September, he might need something a little bit stronger at this point. With Australia\u2019s opening game of the World Cup against France just over two weeks away, deliberation time has run out for the Socceroos boss. There is no more football left to be played and no more opportunities to make cases for selection; 1,153 days after the Socceroos began their journey to Qatar, Arnold will on Tuesday name the 26 players he will take to the biggest sporting event on the planet. But unfortunately for Arnold, while the majority of his squad appears largely settled \u2013 the names of \u201c15 or 16 players\u201d were effectively decided on two months ago and several others have bolstered their cases since \u2013 the picture surrounding the final slots became no clearer across the weekend, particularly for those plying their trade in the Australian top flight.  \u201cIf you think too much about it it can affect your mentality and focus going into games,\u201d said Melbourne City attacker Mat Leckie. \u201cAt the end of the day, the only thing we can do is perform for our clubs and get ourselves in tip-top shape. And then it\u2019s up to Arnie.\u201d Admittedly, for players such as Leckie, the stakes associated with the opening weeks of the ALM season have been low. One of Arnold\u2019s defining features as a coach is his loyalty to his players and he will be loth to drop any that brought him to this point. This will only be heightened by the injuries, lack of club minutes, or some combination of the two that have befallen so many in the months leading into the tournament. The sudden uncertainty surrounding those that would have been considered cornerstones may make the pragmatic Arnold think twice about pulling too many shocks at the selection table. Coming from a position in which he has likely been protecting a position rather than trying to earn one, Leckie\u2019s spot in Qatar was likely secure even without taking into account his important contributions to City\u2019s undefeated start to the domestic season. The same goes for his teammate Jamie Maclaren, whose brace against Perth Glory on Saturday brings him up to seven goals in five games to start the season. Adelaide United winger Craig Goodwin, who has returned to fitness after battling injuries to lead the league in chance creation, is in a similar position, while penalty-shootout hero Andrew Redmayne has avoided falling into a crevice while keeping goal for Sydney FC and will almost certainly also be on the final list. But it all cannot be that easy. Across the last round of ALM before Arnold lays down his squad, City attacker Marco Tilio, Central Coast Mariners duo Garang Kuol and Jason Cummings, and Macarthur dynamo Daniel Arzani took to the field with what was likely just a single spot on the plane up for grabs \u2013 and that is excluding Roma\u2019s Australia-born, Italy junior international Cristian Volpato from the equation. Melbourne Victory romped to a 4-0 win over the Newcastle Jets with Chris Ikonomidis, Nick D\u2019Agostino, and Jake Brimmer all contributing, but the run of three straight games without a goal prior to Friday evening\u2019s dominant display has cast a shadow. Based on form, the player with the strongest resume from the 2022-23 season is Cummings. The Scotland-born attacker has played a key role in three of his side\u2019s four games to start the season and had a signature one-goal and three-assist performance against Western United in round four. Cummings, however, is attempting to break into a largely settled centre-forward group and was largely overshadowed by Kuol in the Mariners\u2019 3-0 win over Western Sydney on Saturday after the 18-year-old yet again turned the game on its head when introduced as a substitute. Kuol\u2019s latest eye-catching display off the bench came after Tilio netted his second goal of the season in City\u2019s win over Glory earlier in the day; the winger finished strongly after a switch to the left in the second half. The question for Tilio is if his combined 18 minutes across the season\u2019s two rounds will cost him at the selection table. With just one match-winning performance under his belt so far this season, Arzani started farthest back of the quartet of hopefuls when he made the trip to Wellington. An assist and another strong individual performance followed \u2013 the 23-year-old leads the league in dribbles attempted and is second in successful dribbles \u2013 but his side\u2019s 4-1 loss and his marker Callan Elliot scoring up the opposite end may have ended his hopes. Possible Socceroos squad: Mat Ryan, Mitch Langerak, Andrew Redmayne, Aziz Behich, Joel King, Harry Souttar, Kye Rowles, Trent Sainsbury, Milos Degenek, Bailey Wright, Nathaniel Atkinson, Fran Karacic, Aaron Mooy, Jackson Irvine, Ajdin Hrustic, Cam Devlin, Riley McGree, Craig Goodwin, Denis Genreau, Awer Mabil, Martin Boyle, Mat Leckie, Garang Kuol, Mitch Duke, Jamie Maclaren, Adam Taggart."

                    "body": "Australia sealed a place in the Rugby League World Cup semi-finals by posting a record score in their 92-0 thumping of France in York. Brad Donald\u2019s side surpassed the 88-point margin set in the last World Cup in 2017 against Canada, running in 17 tries to set up a final group game clash with New Zealand on Thursday (Friday AEDT).  The undefeated Kiwis Ferns brushed the Cook Islands aside earlier on Sunday (Monday AEDT) to claim a 34-4 win with both teams now set to square off for the chance to top Group B.  \u201cIt was really clinical,\u201d Donald said. \u201cThe zero [was most pleasing]. We\u2019d happily win this tournament 2-0 and we showed up for each other. We haven\u2019t got a best side, you could pick anyone from the 24 and they\u2019d perform similarly. There\u2019s a lot of post-contact metres in those Kiwi forwards so we have to make sure we are on our game defensively.\u201d  In Group A, both England and Papua New Guinea are assured of a place in the semi-finals. Winger Shenae Ciesiolka scored after two just minutes, kickstarting the Jillaroos\u2019 dominant first half to finish 58-0 at the break. Jessica Sergis scored four tries, her fellow centre Jaime Chapman grabbed a hat-trick on debut and winger Julia Robinson also crossed three times. Fullback Emma Tonegato, Tallisha Harden, Olivia Kernick and Tarryn Aiken also touched down with Evania Pelite contributing a try-scoring double. It was another harsh reminder of the disparity between Australia and the rest of the world. Australia have yet to concede in this campaign and the chasm between players exposed to the NRLW and those who haven\u2019t, has been laid bare at this tournament.  \u201cWe\u2019ve got an open door policy on what we\u2019ve done and we\u2019d love to share that with any nation,\u201d Donald said. \u201cThey all work but they have transitioned from amateurs into professionals, like Olympians. We would be more than happy to share our programs on what these girls have done to raise the bar.\u201d"

                    "body": "  9.37pm    That\u2019s it from me for tonight. Two quality games to kick off the long awaited tournament. They were both one-sided but showcased just how dangerous some of the heavy hitters will be over the next few weeks. Australia are favourites for a reason. They barely got out of third gear against Fiji and cantered to an easy win. Immense on defence and clinical, for the most part, in the red zone. A few kinks ti iron out, but they\u2019ll surely get that sorted. I hope you enjoyed the coverage today. Til next time.       9.31pm    Here\u2019s the Aussie coach, Mal Meninga:  I\u2019m happy with that. We got through it pretty well. Really happy with the defence. A few things to fix up with the ball, but overall, very happy. The effort around our defence was spot on. All the things we asked of our players [they did really well].  We\u2019ve got some competition in the team. We\u2019ll rest a few guys next week and play some others who can put their foot forward. We talked about how it would be clunky from our point of view. We\u2019ve only been here for a week. We\u2019ll improve as the tournament goes on.      9.27pm    I\u2019m with the pundits on the Beeb. I thought Harry Grant should have been player of the match. He was so good off the bench. Every time he got his hands on it the Aussies looked like doing something. But you know what, credit to Munster. He was class as well. It could have been anyone, to be fair. If we\u2019re honest, the real player of the match was the Kangaroos\u2019 defence coach.      9.25pm    Here\u2019s the player of the match, Cameron Munster  There was a bit [of rustiness]. We should have scored a lot more points but didn\u2019t execute. We go back to the drawing board and can hopefully be a bit better. But happy with the performance. Fiji are a really good side. They have a lot of talent, a lot of heart. It didn\u2019t surprise me that they scored first. Hopefully the go well in this tournament. I\u2019m very luck to be in the middle and have [all the very fast wingers and outside backs] who make me look good.      9.21pm   FULL TIME: Australia 42-8 Fiji  Clinical. Efficient. Ruthless. Australia were all those things. They were also rusty, which is why this dominant display didn\u2019t have an even greater margin of victory. But they won\u2019t care. Grant was great, pulling string and stabbing through kicks. Addo-Carr\u2019s 80 solo try was a joy to watch and Tedesco showed his class. The real triumph was the Australian defence. Wave after wave of white Fijian attacks crashed on green rocks. Immovable. That\u2019s the best word to use. The champions are up and running.   Updated at 9.43pm BST    9.19pm    80 mins: Even with the game well and truly buried, Australia are defending as if they have a title on the line. That is what makes them champions. Fiji can\u2019t get anywhere and their attack ends with them losing the ball on the left. Game over.      9.17pm    79 mins: There are bodies everywhere. Australia knock on inside Fiji\u2019s territory. Fizzling out slightly. One more set for Fiji I reckon before we hear the final whistle.      9.15pm   TRY! Australia 42-8 Fiji (Turuva, 26)  That\u2019s a rugby league try but it started with a soccer move. One kick through was met by another kick by Turuva who then gathers the bouncing ball and dots down over the line. That was almost tiki-taka. Fiji deserve that consolation. They\u2019d been hammering the line with busting runs through the middle. Wakeham misses the conversion. Not that it matters too much. He\u2019ll be annoyed with himself, mind.     9.12pm    75 mins: Nanai has tip-tackled Wakeham. No malice, but that was dicey. They shake hands after and the Fijian isn\u2019t hurt so it\u2019s no card. Just a pen.     9.11pm    73 mis: Valemei is nailed in the tackle. The ball is recycled though and finds its way left. The bal goes right. Quick hands. They\u2019ve got an overlap but cut back in field. Wrong decision. There was a man on the flank and Australia have it back. Not for long. Fiji have it again after Cherry-Evans coughs it up. Becoming a little messy now.     9.09pm    71 mins: Mitchell does brilliantly to find a hole in midfield but his pass left isn\u2019t gathered. Addo-Carr, chasing a hat-trick, punches the ball in frustration. Australia want more.     9.06pm   TRY! Australia 42-4 Fijie (Addo-Carr, 68)  Another aimless kick from Fiji means Australia can canter up field. They advance it upfield. Grant busts a tackle and grubs a kick forward and Addo-Carr, with nitroglycerin in his shoes, runs on to it and makes the points safe. Lovely try. Grant is having a stunner of a game. Holmes, again, makes no mistake from the tee.   Updated at 9.17pm BST    9.02pm    65 mins: Fiji aren\u2019t giving up. They\u2019re charging into the green wall with gusto but are hardly making dents. They\u2019ve got no choice but to hoof the ball into Aussie territory. It\u2019s mopped bu and Mitchell takes it back up field. Crichton also involved with a ploughing carry. Nanai pops a back of the hand off-load that gets the crowd\u2019s attention. Fiji earn the handover 20m from their own line.     8.59pm   TRY! Australia 36-4 Fiji (Tredesco, 61)  Of course he was going to score tonight. The skipper takes the ball in front of him, steps off his right foot while throwing a dummy pass and shaking off Koroisau. Tredesco shifts back in field and rides the challenge of two Fijians. He needs to twist in the tackle and dot down, making it look so simple. Brilliant fullback play. He had front foot ball but that was hardly a gimme. Holmes kicks his sixth kick to maintain his 100% record tonight.   Updated at 9.18pm BST    8.55pm    59 mins: Oh no! That was the chance and they make a mess of it. Valemei spills the ball under pressure after his teammates work a slick move down the left. All he needed to do was gather and pass and the man on the overlap had an easy score, but couldn\u2019t do either.      8.53pm    58 mins: Fiji are so close but just can\u2019t find the space. Such tenacious defence from Australia. Fiji are direct but lack the innovation to work a gap. When they send it wide and give the ball air rush defence from Australia snuffs out the danger.  Fiji have the ball back after an Aussie knock-on. 20m out.     8.51pm    Big head clash! Cotter was knocked out there for a second. His head makes sickening contact with Kamikamica\u2019s but it\u2019s the Aussie who comes out worse. His eyes roll back momentarily and he goes limp as his body heads to the ground. He walks of the field but that was nasty.     8.49pm   TRY! Australia 30-4 Fiji (Grant, 54)  Australia have the ball in the red zone because of Grant\u2019s 40-20 so it\u2019s only fitting he has the final say on this move. The ball goes right and then comes back left. Grant runs a wonderful line across the Fijians and gets the ball at pace. He keeps moving left before straightening and darting for the line. No one can lay a hand on him and scores the try that\u2019s subsequently converted.   Updated at 9.05pm BST    8.46pm    53 mins: Better from Fiji. Wong involved in this charge up field. Naiqama as well. They get into Aussie territory and hoist a cross field kick. They can\u2019t come away with the ball but that looks the most likely chance of them working the space. Australia get up the field and win a 40-20 from Grant with a raking kick. Excellent punt.     8.43pm    50 mins: Fijian ball deep in their own territory from a scrum in midfield. Ball goes right. Then left. Wherever it goes there\u2019s at least two Aussies to close down the runner. Fiji going nowhere. Carrigan impressive on defence as well. Fiji have to kick.  Addo-Carr takes it back up field. Holmes moves it pat the 50m line. Carrigan knocks on in the challenge.      8.41pm    Kikau has copped a blow to his head so will go off for some treatment and a check. He does look groggy. Hope he\u2019s OK.     8.40pm    48 mins: How did Australia not score there? Munster is all over this pitch. He gets it on the chrage within striking distance and plays it left to Addo-Carr. You\u2019d have bet the farm on the winger making a dart for the corner but he plays an odd grubber back in field. It almost works as three men in green are waiting but it misses them all and bounces beyond the dead ball line.     8.37pm   TRY! Australia 24-4 Fiji (Mitchell, 45)  Another scorcher of a try with Addo-Carr heavily involved. Munster starts the move and spots space down the blindside. He frees his hands and unleashes Addo-Carr down the wing. The winger screams down the flank and has the vision to play it back inside to Munster who stays in support. Mitchell is on his inside and gets the ball to slide under the posts. Brilliant footy from the champions. So clinical. Two more points from the conversion opens a 20 point gap.   Updated at 9.05pm BST    8.35pm    44 mins: Carrigan, again. My goodness, he\u2019s a battering ram. Australia targeting the middle of the park. They then kick to the corner and put heaps of pressure on the Fijians cleaning up. Moceidreke kicks but doesn\u2019t have any support runners. Australia counter\u2026.     8.33pm    42 mins: Australia get the ball but make an error on the ground. Wighton doesn\u2019t play the ball correctly on the ground so it\u2019s Fiji\u2019s to use. Sadrugu takes it close to the red zone. Turuva, who had a quiet first half, gets on the ball. Koroisau pops it right for Wakeham who kicks through but it catches an Aussie knee and now the ball is with green.  Updated at 8.33pm BST    8.31pm    Right then. They players are back out. Fiji have to score first but even then, Australia just looked so comfortable, they probably have two more gears they could reach. let\u2019s see how they get on.     8.19pm   HALF TIME: Australia 18-4 Fiji  It was a dream start for Fiji who scored a wonderful try with less than five minutes on the clock. But the Kangaroos are the footy kings for a reason. Once they gained their composure they drove it through the middle, kept their defence water tight and found half gaps as they emerged.  Addo-Carr\u2019s blistering 80m try was the standout, but it was more a case of ruthless efficiency that sees the reigning champions take a healthy lead to the break. I\u2019m off to make a quick cuppa. See you in a few.     8.16pm    40 mins: Australia get the ball back after a collision off the ball. Mitchell things he\u2019s scored. But it\u2019s a knock on. Scrappy end to the half.     8.15pm    38 mins: Carrigan is relentless. He\u2019s won just about every collision he\u2019s been involved in. Grant also busting it up through the midfield. Australia handover 10m out on the left. Fiji take it back up through the middle. They can\u2019t find any space out there. The Aussies seem to be defending with an extra man.      8.13pm   TRY! Australian 18-4 Fiji (Crichton, 36)  Carrigan, Micthell, relentless running from Australia. They inch it forward. Mitchell picks it up and plays a wonderfully weighted short ball to Crichton running on the angle. He\u2019s too strong from the tackler on the line and gets over with a stretch of his meaty arm. Just ruthless from the \u2018Roos. Holmes adds the extra two points.     8.10pm    35 mins: Cherry Evans lifts a teasing kick and Munster is underneath it. All he has to do is catch and fall over the line. He gets up but can\u2019t hold it, spilling it as he lands. Another missed opportunity. Great kick from Cherry Evans. It\u2019s slippery out there, that would be his only defence. That and a Fijian proving a legal obstacle.     8.08pm    33 mins: ValemeiSivo gets it in space on the left but can\u2019t punch through the half gap. Tye ball goes right and then left again. Sadrugu is strong in the tacjle. Kikau collects a short flat pass. Wakeham is so close to collecting the kick through, what a poke that was off the toe, but he spills it over the line. Big moment in the game.     8.07pm    31 mins: Valemei does really well collecting a flat pass on the right. A good kick that follows puts Australia under pressure on the right. The kick chasing has been solid from the Fijians. It\u2019s an arm wrestle. Carrigan has the ball after being tackled but spills it as he rolls it through his legs. Knock on. Fijian ball from a great platform.      8.05pm    28 mins: Fiji back on the ball. They look ragged already. But they\u2019re charging into contact with enthusiasm. They reach Aussie territory before hoisting a high kick. Sivo can\u2019t haul it down as Australia gather well under pressure. They launch a counter from deep. Send the ball left and then right, taking to the halfway line before kicking. Fiji run it back into the maw.      8.02pm   TRY! Australia 12-4 Fiji (Addo-Carr, 25)  Coast to coast! Blistering pace from Addo-Carr. He\u2019s been dubbed the fastest man in the game and he\u2019s proved that with a scorching solo effort that began with his heels on his own try line and ended with him dotting down beyond Fiji\u2019s. A poked kick from Fiji was mopped up and swiftly shovelled left where Addo-Carr had a sliver of space. That\u2019s all he needed. He hit the nitro-boosters and screamed up field. What a score. Holmes\u2019 conversion stretches the lead.     Updated at 8.16pm BST    8.00pm    24 mins: Australia\u2019s defensive line speed is so impressive. They\u2019re suffocating Fijian runners before they\u2019ve had time to think. Still, Fiji get up past the halfway line with strong runs. Nakubuwai shakes his man. Tghere\u2019s a great kick through but Tedesco mops up after it bounces off the post.     7.58pm    No try. Nanai did ground the ball over the line but he had already been tackled so the ball was effectively dead already.      7.57pm    21 mins: A good counter run from Wong gets Fiji going forward but they lose the ball again. Cherry-Evans crucial there in the tackle. Tedesco does brilliantly to keep the ball alive by wrestling it away from the Fijians. He offloads and its recycled. Nanai collects against the grain and busts over the line. Has he got it down? he arrived onto that with great pace. Would be a heck of a finish, behind the back, if he has.     7.55pm    19 mins: The restart doesn\u2019t work well for Fiji. They give up a penalty and then get docked a further 10m for arguing with the ref. Australia have the ball back in Fijian territory. Tedesco jinks, Holmes looks for a gap. There\u2019s a cross-kick from right to left. It hangs up in their air, Mitchell is underneath it can\u2019t get hold of it. Australia have the feed to the scrum right in front of the poles. All very scrappy though as Faasuamaleaui can\u2019t collect the pass.     7.52pm   TRY! Australia 6-4 Fiji (Nanai, 16)  That\u2019s more like it. Nanai is a try machine in the NRL ane he gets one here. Collects a flat early pass from Cherry-Evans and steps off his right foot, working a half gap. He accelerates and charges to the poles. It looked simple, but it was anything but. High quality footy made simple. Holmes slots the extras as the \u2018Roos nudge ahead.   Updated at 8.13pm BST    7.49pm    15 mins: Munster sends it left. Faasuamaleaui gets it on the run through the middle. Munster pops a short pass but Australia knock on in the red zone. Mitche;; stepping but can\u2019t offload as he loses his patience.  Fiji slow things down with some short balls in midfield. Kamikamica gets through the challenge. Koroisau makes an error, though, and possession changes again. Both teams a little sloppy.      7.47pm    13 mins: Faasuamaleaui is everywhere. Cherry-Evans is dictating play. The ball goes right. There are numbers and space but, oh, a Fijian, (who was that?) sticks a hand out and steals an intercept. They survive the onslaught. But they cough it up again. Aussie ball. The green wave will be back after this scrum.     7.45pm    No card, but a pen for Australia 1m out in the right corner.     7.44pm    11 mins: A good run back in field from Murray gives the \u2018Roos go fofward. A spinning wide pass from Cherry-Evans finds space on the right. It bcomes back in field and they have a new set og six to play with 5m out. A pass left and then a pass right creates an overlap left. Munster straightens but can\u2019t fund a gap. They\u2019re so close. Taulagi gets it from a Tedesco pass. He\u2019s diving for the line but two Fijians prevent him from dotting down. Great scrambling defence. Could be a card, though, for a high hit.     7.41pm    9 mins: Australia have kick and it\u2019s a good one in the corner. The chase is good too so Fiji scramble to escape. But they do so with composure. Australia are ramping up the tempo. Trbojevic involved in a few heavy charges. Penalty Australia who kick it into touch 10m into Fijian territory. They seem to be waking up.     7.40pm    7 mins: A strong carry from Wakeham from the restart. Fiji take it to the edge of their own territory before they kick. The chase is a good one and the mop up the Aussie counter before it gets going. In fact, Fiji are tackling really well, driving the men in green back in the collision.      7.38pm   TRY! Australia 0-4 Fiji (Valemi, 4)  Sensational! What a start. That is exactly what Fiji needed if they had any hope of winning this one. Fiji drive the ball up and get within striking distance. The shape to go down the open side but it goes left to the blindside instead. Tedesco doesn\u2019t read it and the stabbed kick behind the line by Moceidreke is perfectly mopped up by a diving Valemei who dots down. The conversion is missed. Still, the Aussies look shellshocked.    Updated at 8.06pm BST    7.35pm    2 mins: A decent start for Fiji who get their hands on the ball first. They take it to the half way line and then kick. Australia bring it back to the middle of the field but the phase ends with a Fijian penalty. Impressive tackling as well as from the men in white. They hoof the penalty 10m in to Aussie territory and get things going once again.     7.31pm    Right then. Here. We. GO!     7.29pm    Oh wow! I don\u2019t know what this is called (please someone let me know) but rather than a war dance, the Fijians are standing in a circle, shoulder to shoulder, their eyes are closed, and they\u2019re singing. It\u2019s so moving. Beautiful. It sounds like a hymn but unmistakably from the South Pacific. \u201cHallelujah\u201d they sing. If they play as well as they hold a note they\u2019re steamroll the Kangaroos.   Updated at 7.49pm BST    7.24pm    Not long to go now. Fiji not given much hope by the Beeb pundits. Their head coach Joe Rabele has been hospitalised with illness and there have been some later injury blows. Could be a long, cold night for the Fijians. The teams are coming out the tunnel. The Anthems are underway. Not long to go now.    Updated at 7.51pm BST    7.16pm    Reckon he can do it tonight? Either way, that record will fall over the next five weeks. No doubt about that.      7.12pm    1, 078 days. That\u2019s how long it\u2019s been since the Kangaroos last played a competitive match. That\u2019s partly why they\u2019ve got 13 debutants today. It\u2019s an astounding spell without any action. Could the be rusty?      7.07pm    There are Aussies all over the place in the World Cup. Victor Radley, born in Sydney, was awarded the player of the match award earlier today. France are steered by an Aussie, a man responsible for doing likewise at the Sydney is Roosters. Nick Tedeschi chatted with Trent Robinson this week. Have a gander:      6.55pm    Did you catch the opening ceremony? It was a shambles. The PA system at St James\u2019 Park had packed up. The folks dignitaries responsible for bringing the sizeable trophies onto the pitch were left looking a bit awkward and the Kaiser Chiefs were reduced to just one song.  But these things happen sometimes and it really isn\u2019t the end of the world. Still, the tournament organisers have issued an apology. Fair play to \u2018em.      6.53pm   Fiji hoping to cause an upset  It\u2019s not going to happen. I mean, it really isn\u2019t. Fiji were swatted aside 50-0 by England in a warm-up earlier this month. But hey, stranger things have happened. I\u2019m sure of it. Fiji: Sunia Turuva, Mitieli Vulikijapani, Kevin Naiqama, Semi Valemei, Maika Sivo, Siti Moceidreke, Brandon Wakeham, King Vuniyayawa, Apisai Koroisau, Tui Kamikamica, Viliame Kikau, Siua Wong, Lamar Manuel-Liolevave. Interchanges: Penioni Tagituimua, Jowasa Drodrolagi, Ben Nakubuwai, Taniela Sadrugu, Netane Masima.     6.46pm   Australia name team for title defence  Captain James Tedesco has said that this World Cup will be his team\u2019s \u201ctoughest test\u201d yet. They\u2019re expected to run out comfortable winners against Fiji and have named a formidable outfit to get things underway: Australia: James Tedesco, Josh Addo-Carr, Latrell Mitchell, Valentine Holmes, Murray Taulagi, Cameron Munster, Daly Cherry-Evans, Tino Fa\u2019asuamaleaui, Ben Hunt, Jake Trobojevic, Angus Crichton, Jeremiah Nanai, Cameron Murray. Interchanges: Harry Grant, Reuben Cotter, Patrick Carrigan, Jack Wighton, Matt Burton.   Updated at 7.31pm BST    6.39pm    Did you catch England\u2019s demolition of Samoa earlier? Worth revisiting if you did. The hosts were imperious. Just so, so good.  Here\u2019s Aaron Bower\u2019s report from Newcastle:      6.36pm    Who knew the biggest bugbear would be found on the players\u2019 back? Don\u2019t believe me, go ask the Kangaroos legend Steve Renouf, who wore the No 3 jersey 30 years ago when Australia beat Great Britain in the final in Brisbane, said he was \u201cshattered\u201d (yes, really) that the players would wear squad numbers, rather than the numbers that directly correlated to the match-day starting positions. \u201cImagine starting in the team and getting 24. People would always think you were a reserve,\u201d he told AAP this week. Seems a bit overblown to me. Tell me, what am I missing here? It\u2019s not just Renouf. Even Kangaroos coach Mal Meninga is upset. Wonder if he\u2019ll actually care once the opening whistle sounds.     6.30pm   Preamble  It\u2019s been billed as the most competitive Rugby World Cup in living memory. England are resurgent. New Zealand are a force on the rise. Tonga have shown they can mix it with the big boys and Samoa, despite the events of a few hours ago, have enough stars to cause an upset along the way. The Kangaroos, the defending champions, will be eager to squash all that talk and underline their status as the most successful rugby league team in the world. They\u2019re without some players who might have been with them but they\u2019re still the side to beat. Fiji won\u2019t be a pushover, physically at least, and should provide a stern test of Mal Meninga\u2019s charges. My name is Daniel and it\u2019d be great if you dropped me an email or shot me a tweet. Kick off is at 7:30pm local time.   "

                    "body": "\n 1.46pm  \n\nThanks for reading, enjoy today\u2019s match, and we\u2019ll be back for more top blogging tomorrow.\n\n\n\n 1.44pm  \n\nThe time has come to close this blog down but never fear: Rob Smyth has Croatia v Morocco, right here \u2026 and it\u2019s live!\n\n\n\n\n 1.40pm  \n\n\u201cWe are convinced of the power of our game.\u201d A short phrase by Gianni Infantino, the president of Fifa, from his closing press conference at this winter\u2019s World Cup. Compared with his opening speech some four weeks previously, a wild-eyed address that went viral in a manner unusual for sports administrators, it appears harmless enough. But the more you stare at the words, the more revealing the sentence becomes.\nThe power of football has been a matter of contention for the duration of Qatar 2022. What the world\u2019s most popular spectator sport symbolises, what it can achieve, and what it can cover up have been the subject of intense debate. Tomorrow the tournament reaches its climax with a blue-chip final between France and Argentina. As the world tunes in, perhaps now is the time to draw conclusions as to the effect of such power.\n\n\n\n\n 1.39pm  \n\nOver in Kosovo, meanwhile, the artist Alkent Pozhegu has made a Messi and Mbapp\u00e9 mosaic from grain and seeds in the town of Gjakova. You love to see it.\n\n\n\n\n 1.32pm  \n\nHere\u2019s a Mbapp\u00e9 v Messi \u2018tale of the tape\u2019 thing I compiled before tomorrow\u2019s final.\nYou can also enjoy it in today\u2019s main section of the Guardian newspaper, which I highly recommend rushing out and buying. \n\n\n\n\n\n 1.27pm  \n\nAs the World Cup winners lift the golden trophy on Sunday evening, an alternative to the ultimate footballing achievement will highlight alleged corruption and reported human rights violations that have been a feature of the 2022 tournament hosted by Qatar.\nA Russian-born conceptual artist has created a replica of the World Cup trophy that slowly fills with crude oil. It has a symbolic price of $150m \u2013 a figure that matches the amount of money allegedly spent on bribes and kickbacks to Fifa officials, according to US criminal investigators in 2015.\n\n\n\n\n 1.12pm  \n\nGreat insight here on Didier Deschamps, the France head coach, by Philippe Auclair:\n\u201cThis has already been a World Cup of records for France, who are chasing a third title in less than a quarter of a century on Sunday. The captain, Hugo Lloris, will celebrate his 145th cap against Argentina, three more than the previous record holder, Lilian Thuram. Olivier Giroud equalled, then surpassed, the 52 goals that Thierry Henry had scored for Les Bleus. Antoine Griezmann, one of this tournament\u2019s standout performers, has now played a barely believable 72 consecutive games for France.\n\u201cThen there is Didier Deschamps, who will be attempting to win the World Cup for a third time to go level with Pel\u00e9, the only other person to have achieved that feat; Deschamps, one of only three men, the others being Brazil\u2019s M\u00e1rio Zagallo and Germany\u2019s Franz Beckenbauer, to become a world champion as a manager and as a player; Deschamps who, if France win on Sunday, will have a legitimate claim to be considered the most decorated man in the history of the game; Deschamps, who only joined a football club at the age of 11, and has certainly made up for lost time since then.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n 1.07pm  \n\nA gallery of weird and wonderful World Cup-related images here, compiled by Steven Bloor:\n\n\n\n\n 12.54pm  \n\nMore Reuters content: Here are ten World Cup highlights as chosen by their team of reporters at the tournament.\nSaudi Arabia stun ArgentinaArgentina were cruising in their opening Group C game after Lionel Messi scored a first-half penalty. But the Green Falcons swooped after half time with Saleh Al-Shehri squeezing in a low shot to equalise and five minutes later Salem Al-Dawsari curled in a scorching second to leave Argentina in disbelief and Saudi fans joyously singing \u2018where is Messi?\u2019.\nSouth Korea\u2019s nervous waitWhen Hwang Hee-chan scored a stoppage-time winner for South Korea in their final Group H game the hard part was just starting. The players then had to spend almost 10 agonising minutes in a tight huddle in the centre circle peering at phones, hoping Uruguay would not score another goal against Ghana. Finally, with a last-16 place assured, they sprinted en masse towards their delirious fans.\nMessi bamboozles Gvardiol Such has been the Argentine No 10\u2019s impact in Qatar that the seven-times Ballon D\u2019or winner could have multiple entries on the memorable list. But the way he held off Croatia\u2019s masked defender Josko Gvardiol, then bamboozled him with an electrifying twist to set up the third goal in a 3-0 semi-final win, encapsulated the 35-year-old\u2019s genius.\nRonaldo\u2019s tearful exitPortugal\u2019s talisman became the first male player to score in five World Cups with a penalty against Ghana. But the 37-year-old was subsequently left out of the starting lineup and after he was unable to save his side after coming off the bench in the quarter-final against Morocco he was filmed walking down the tunnel in floods of tears.\n\nFirst female refereeFrenchwoman St\u00e9phanie Frappart was handed control of Germany\u2019s final Group E clash against Costa Rica, becoming the first female referee to officiate at a men\u2019s World Cup. Costa Rica coach Luis Fernando Su\u00e1rez described it as a big step forward in a \u2018sexist sport\u2019 and the 39-year-old Frappart produced a calm and assured display in Germany\u2019s victory.\nJapan shock GermanyBefore kick-off in their Group E opener Germany\u2019s players covered their mouths in protest at Fifa\u2019s threat of sanctions against the wearing of the \u2018OneLove\u2019 armband. At the final whistle they were left gobsmacked after Japan\u2019s substitutes Ritsu Doan and Takuma Asano secured an unlikely 2-1 comeback win for the Samurai Blue, whose fans celebrated hard before tidying up the litter in the stadium.\n\nMorocco fansThousands of them descended on the Arabian Gulf to roar the Atlas Lions and were richly rewarded as Morocco became the first African and first Arab country to reach the semi-finals. The noise the red-clad hordes created in the stadiums was deafening and reached fever pitch in the penalty shootout defeat of Spain in the last 16 and against Portugal in the quarter-finals when a cacophony of whistles greeted every touch by the opposition as Morocco protected their 1-0 lead.\nGroup E finale mayhemA group that began with Germany losing to Japan and Spain putting seven goals past Costa Rica concluded on a tumultuous night that almost turned the football world upside-down. Germany needed a win over Costa Rica and for Spain to beat Japan to go through as runners-up, and at halftime that was exactly what was happening. Then everything went mad. Japan scored twice in three minutes early in the second half and Costa Rica flipped their game against Germany to lead and for four minutes the live table showed Japan and Costa Rica in first and second place with Spain and Germany going home. Germany ended up winning 4-2 to save Spain\u2019s bacon, although they were on the flight home the next day.\nMbapp\u00e9 eliminates PolandKylian Mbapp\u00e9 has enhanced his reputation as one of the best players in the world in Qatar and the Frenchman was simply unplayable in the last 16 against Poland. First he set up Olivier Giroud to open the scoring then took matters into his own hands with two sublime finishes to seal a 3-0 win. He was clocked running at 35.3kph during the game.\nAboubakar sinks BrazilA manic group phase concluded in almost comical fashion as Cameroon\u2019s Vincent Aboubakar scored a stoppage-time winner against an already-qualified Brazil, took his shirt off, and was immediately given a second yellow card by an apologetic referee, who shook the player\u2019s hand as he dismissed him.\n\nUpdated at 1.24pm GMT\n\n\n 12.41pm  \n\nFifa have released a downloadable digital World Cup final programme for tomorrow\u2019s sizeable clash between Argentina and France. Get stuck in:\n\n\n\n\n 12.28pm  \n\nAs French star Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 gears up for the World Cup final on Sunday in Qatar, the forward\u2019s presence is also felt strongly in Bondy, the satellite city of Paris where he grew up.\n\u201cAh, Kylian, the rising star \u2013 the star of the stars,\u201d said Kamel Ghehioueche, 41, bundled up in front of the city hall, an austere, concrete building from the 1960s, as parking agents cleared a lot for the Christmas market.\nLocal enthusiasm for the city\u2019s favorite son is palpable, piercing through the winter gloom ahead of Sunday\u2019s match between the reigning champions and Argentina.\nFor his second World Cup final, Mbapp\u00e9, 23, will be playing against his Paris Saint-Germain teammate Lionel Messi.\n\n\u201cKiki, we love you!\u201d said Melissa Toumi, 28, who crossed paths with Mbapp\u00e9 during his youth, training on the soccer pitch.\nIn the parking lot of burger joint Harry\u2019s Cafe, the famous striker\u2019s image towers behind her, blanketing one side of a 10-story building.\n\u201cWe want the third star,\u201d said her friend Dounia Zeghadi, 34, referring to another star on the French team\u2019s jersey signifying their third World Cup victory after their previous two in 1998 and 2018, where Mbapp\u00e9 shot to fame.\n\u201cKylian, bring home the prize, inshallah,\u201d said Frikhi Mansour, who recalled regularly cutting Mbapp\u00e9\u2019s hair when he was young.\n\u201cI told him, \u2018When you\u2019re a great football star, call me!\u2019 It\u2019s a great memory,\u201d he said, pointing to photos snapped with the star draped in a barber\u2019s cape. (Reuters)\n\nUpdated at 12.30pm GMT\n\n\n 12.21pm  \n\nThanks John. I like it that Deschamps said the cold virus affecting his squad before the final is \u201cobviously a situation\u201d. It\u2019s very Glenn Hoddle, or indeed very late, great Graham Taylor.\nPlease email me any World Cup-related thoughts. Funny stuff, interesting stuff, it\u2019s your choice!\n\n\n\n 12.16pm  \n\nAnd with that, the blog is placed in the cold, dead hands of Luke McLaughlin. For a while, at least. \n\n\n\n 12.15pm  \n\nAmerico gets in touch, with a public service request: \u201cI have a favour to ask: yesterday a reader sent an email, asking other readers to recommend a place to see the final in Paris. \n\u201cIn that spirit, I was wondering if you could help me: my partner will be in central London tomorrow for the game, and throughout the World Cup she\u2019s grown accustomed to watching the games in what I would call an Argentinian \u201cambience\u201d here in Spain. It doesn\u2019t need to be a place filled exclusively with Argentina supporters; somewhere with a nicely mixed crowd would be perfect!\u201d\nAny ideas, anyone? \n\n\n\n 12.09pm  \n\n\u201cWinning the World Cup\u201d means more than lifting the trophy these days. No doubt, should Saudi Arabia host 2030, it will be hailed as the \u201cbest World Cup ever\u201d before during and after the tournament, to follow the same pattern as with Qatar. \n\nFor Saudi, landing the trophy tournament in 2030 could offer rehabilitation on the world stage for crown prince Mohammed bin Salman. He was initially lauded as a reformer who might lead the kingdom on a path to modernity, until the murder of the dissident journalist Jamal Khashoggi left it a pariah. The country\u2019s role in the bombing in Yemen, restrictions on women\u2019s rights and its use of the death penalty have further damaged its international reputation. Recently, Saudi\u2019s decision to defy American pressure on oil production has frayed already uneasy relations.\n\n\n\n\n\n 11.41am  \n\nJonathan Wilson\u2019s had his chalkboard and leather elbow pads out again. No Hamlet sub-headings this week. \n\u201cStopping Messi. Stopping Mbapp\u00e9. Hernandez v De Paul. Stopping Griezmann.\u201d: is that from Coriolanus? \n\n\n\n\n 11.36am  \n\nFrance\u2019s Hugo Lloris is bidding to become the first man to captain two World Cup winning teams. In 1934 and 1938, the Italian captains were first Gianpiero Combi and then Giuseppe Meazza. In 1958 and 1962, the Brazilian captains were Hilderaldo Bellini and then Mauro Ramos. \nHe\u2019s been speaking about the Doha flu in the French camp. \n\nWe are going to try and do our best in spite of the circumstances. I think thanks to the adrenaline and the excitement we will feel we will all be fit enough and ready to do whatever we can to win this last battle.\nIn the past we have proved that French teams who have been successful have always based that success on a strong team spirit.\nSo we try to draw from that, there is a very good feeling in the camp since the beginning of the tournament and there is no reason why that shouldn\u2019t be the same again tomorrow.\nYou\u2019re never really prepared for that type of thing but we are trying to get ready for this match the best we can, these are things for which we weren\u2019t necessarily prepared but we remain focused and of course we are very excited to play in a World Cup final.\n\n\n\n\n 11.06am  \n\nTom Jenkins has been out in Qatar for the duration, and captured the passion of Argentina\u2019s fans. It\u2019s often been left up to them to add colour to the tournament. \n\n\n\n\n 10.41am  \n\nSome strong quotes from the scene of that A-League violence. \n\n\n\n\n 10.34am  \n\nDidier Deschamps has been speaking this morning on the ongoing sickness within the French camp. More to follow but some sample quotes. \n\nWe try to take the maximum precautions, to adapt and to deal with it, without going overboard. It is obviously a situation. If it could not exist it would be better, but we manage as best we can.\nI have no worries or stress. The important thing in preparing for a match like this is to remain calm.\nIn a World Cup final, there is the match, but also the context which is particular. But I know that the Argentinians, and maybe some French people too, would like to see Messi win the title.\n\n\n\n\n\n 10.29am  \n\nWill Nash gets in touch: \u201cIsn\u2019t Messi winning the World Cup the ultimate in sportswashing? Everyone seems to be firmly on board, though.\u201d \nEmployed by Qatar, an ambassadorial role for Saudi Arabia, Messi does embody that idea, but then again Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 is also a PSG player. \nNick Ames, as ever, says it well here. \n\nPairing the world\u2019s most gifted forward with his heir apparent, along with the more divisive figure of Neymar, was intended as a fail-safe plan to microwave the highest level of success for Qatar\u2019s club project. But it also ensured those players were inextricably linked with the nation when its $220bn exercise in soft power and diplomacy took centre stage. They have both delivered, and little that occurs in Lusail this weekend will change that. Shocks and underdog stories have provided welcome diversions, opening genuinely healthy discussions about football\u2019s distribution of power, but only two individuals\u2019 names will cut through the hubbub.\n\n\n\n\n\n 10.08am  \n\nUnrest and violence in the A-League. Pretty jarring viewing. \n\nAs supporters flooded on to the field of play, a metal bucket used to dispose of flares was thrown in the direction of Glover, striking him in the face and drawing blood. The match referee, who was left covered in ash from the bucket, had no choice but to pull the players off the pitch and suspend play, before it was later abandoned.\nIt comes after a day of protests across the A-League Men competition, as fans made their feelings known about the Australian Professional Leagues\u2019 controversial decision to sell off grand final hosting rights to Sydney for the next three years.\n\n\n\n\n\n 9.54am  \n\nRelentless hype in Bavaria here. \n\n\n\n\n 9.53am  \n\nIt wasn\u2019t just David Beckham who made a lot of money from Qatar\u2019s World Cup. \n\nOne Briton who played an important role in the World Cup press operation is Richard Conway, who as a BBC Sport correspondent in 2018 produced an upbeat report on the preparations for the Qatar World Cup while riding a camel across the desert. A few months later he left journalism to form his own PR agency and has been working exclusively on the Qatar World Cup for several years. Journalists who have dealt with him say he has adopted a hands-off approach, acting as an informal conduit and enabling conversations by inviting critics of the World Cup and prominent newspaper journalists to off-the-record meetings with senior Qatari officials at London hotels.\nMany Britons also work for the Qatari division of Teneo Blue Rubicon, a PR agency that has worked hard to promote the country, while journalists who have written critically about the country have also received legal letters from the law firm Carter Ruck. Neither company returned a request for comment on the nature of their work in the country.\n\n\n\n\n\n 9.44am  \n\nA short line on the World Cup final referee, Szymon Marciniak, from Poland, per Reuters. He will follow in the tradition of bald World Cup final referees, broken up only by Nicola Rizzoli in 2014 since Pierluigi Collina. Nestor Pitana four years ago may well have engaged assistance since Russia but Marciniak follows in the Collina/Howard Webb tradition. Perhaps it\u2019s a Gianni Infantino thing. \n\nThe 41-year-old, who became a Fifa referee in 2011, was all set to officiate in the European Championship last year before he was diagnosed with Tachycardia.\n\u201cI had a very difficult time for the last year-and-a-half. I had Tachycardia - it\u2019s a heart illness. In the beginning, it was very difficult for me and I had to stop refereeing,\u201d Marciniak said. \u201cI missed the UEFA European Championship, it was a terrible feeling. Now, life gives back to me and I cannot even stop smiling because it\u2019s a great feeling.\u201d\nHe took charge in France\u2019s 2-1 group stage win over Denmark where Kylian Mbappe scored twice before watching Messi lead Argentina to a 2-1 win over Australia in the last 16.\nMarciniak is not the only Polish official who will be on the pitch, however. He will be assisted by compatriots \u2013 Pawel Sokolnicki and Tomasz Listkiewicz - all of whom worked together at the 2018 World Cup in Russia as well. Poland\u2019s Tomasz Kwiatkowski will be in his ear as the Video Assistant Referee (VAR) while American Ismail Elfath - a two-times Major League Soccer Referee of the Year - will be the fourth official.\n\n\n\nUpdated at 9.45am GMT\n\n\n 9.22am  \n\nThe French are chasing history, according to L\u2019\u00c9quipe, that World Cup retention only achieved by Brazil in 1958 and 1962, and Italy in 1934 and 1938. \n\n\n\n\n 9.17am  \n\nBetter known for its love of cricket, every four years India and the wider region are gripped by World Cup fever.\n\n\u201cArgentina is the land of Messi and Che Guevara. Whether it wins or not in the final, I will continue to be a diehard fan,\u201d said TM Thomas Issac, an economist and member of Kerala\u2019s ruling Communist Party of India (Marxist).\nAhead of Sunday\u2019s final, the state has descended into a blue-and-white frenzy, and public screenings, where thousands will attend, are being arranged by fans and local authorities. After a clash erupted between Argentina and Brazil fans during the beginning of the World Cup, police said they had beefed up security for Sunday.\n\n\n\n\n\n 9.02am  \n\nRob Smyth emails in, and is correct, as ever. \u201cI think it was Sweden who finished third in 94, if only because I vaguely remember a dreadlocked Henrik Larsson scoring.\u201d\n\n\nUpdated at 9.02am GMT\n\n\n 9.00am  \n\nTony \u201cTP\u201d Paley has interviewed the man whose voice will guide UK viewers through the final. Guy Mowbray and Steve Wilson continue to be such safe pairs of hands for the BBC, and Jon Champion and Clive \u201cClive\u201d Tyldesley did a good job for ITV, before the latter\u2019s somewhat controversial early exit, while Sam Matterface continues to come in for a criticism that often appears a tad OTT. The breakout stars on the mic have been Seb Hutchinson on ITV, who has been excellent and full of fun, and Pien Meulensteen on the BBC. \n\n\n\n\n 8.46am  \n\nBarney Ronay on the dark shadow that will, despite Fifa and Qatar\u2019s gush, forever loom over the 2022 World Cup. \n\nThe fact is death and suffering were the inevitable collateral to this project from the moment Sepp Blatter read out the word \u201cQatar\u201d in that weirdly strangled upbeat tone, crowded on his own stage by glad-handing power-brokers; and feeling, perhaps, through the lineups and posed smiles, that shadow already at his back, just out of shot, scythe clanking happily.\nDo we have to say this again? Because what we have here is still an open case. The dots have not been joined.\n\n\n\n\n\n 8.32am  \n\nLet\u2019s start with the big one, the third-place playoff.\nFrom today\u2019s World Cup briefing: \n\nAnother chance to see InfantinoIt seems within seconds of any World Cup match starting, the camera pans to Fifa president Gianni Infantino looking glum in the stands. The host broadcast camera operator always knows where to find him, allowing the world to celebrate his greatness. Rarely has he looked happy when watching a match but he is always there, committed to the cause like a parent on muddy sidelines every weekend. He will make the best of the occasion to celebrate football as a cohesive power for good or some such, while ignoring the empty seats. And if that does not entice you, then nothing will.\n\n\n\nUpdated at 8.37am GMT\n\n\n 8.30am  \nPreamble\n\nIt\u2019s MD-1, as they call these things, and the buildup continues to the final. First though, there\u2019s the third-place playoff, and the chance for Croatia or Morocco to finish on the World Cup podium. Winning would make it three podium finishes for the Croats \u2013 1998, 2018 and now \u2013 while Morocco can do something nobody in the Arab or African world has done. Should they do that, then they would follow the likes of Turkey in 2002 and Bulgaria in 1994 as being surprise packages who get a nice reward for a near-golden month at the World Cup. \nNews is keenly awaited from the French camp as to the health of their players amid that unfortunate flu outbreak, with Rapha\u00ebl Varane, Ibrahim Konat\u00e9 and Kingsley Coman in the sick bay. Argentina meanwhile seem to have a relatively clean bill of health, give or take Angel D\u00ed Maria\u2019s creaking bones and the possibility Lionel Messi is carrying a hamstring problem. No word of the latter, nor is there likely to be, but could he emulate his old mate Ronaldo at Euro 2016 and find himself coaching from the sidelines? \nThe latest news and features will roll in all day ahead of Croatia-Morocco, so join me.\n\n"

                    "body": "  4.57pm   Report  And here\u2019s Aaron\u2019s report. He\u2019s leading with Dom Young\u2019s double in the first half \u2013 both absolute belters \u2013 but really he could have kicked off with any English player, that\u2019s how good they were. As you\u2019d expect, Aaron\u2019s telling of the game is just as slick.  That\u2019s me done for now. If you\u2019re about later I\u2019m also reporting live on the Australia Fiji game. No doubt the Kangaroos would have been watching. England mean business. See ya later.  Updated at 4.57pm BST    4.53pm    Aaron is clearly saving his grandiose verbosity for his report. He\u2019s not wrong though. This lot (as in England) can play.      4.51pm    Very good.      4.47pm    Here\u2019s a message from the organisers. In case you missed the start, it was slightly shambolic. Though everyone in the ground probably couldn\u2019t care less after that display. Still, worth sharing the apology, I think:      4.44pm    Player of the match Victor Radley is chatting with the Beeb:  It was really enjoyable. It was really tough start. I\u2019m not sure how I was man of the match, that\u2019s a bit embarrassing. We scored some points in the end which didn\u2019t show how the game went.  I didn\u2019t feel like an underdog myself. We showed that tonight. We\u2019re getting tighter everyday. Giving everyone a hug and a kiss after, it was really good. I\u2019m really happy.      4.42pm   FULL-TIME: England 60-6 Samoa  Well that didn\u2019t go according to the script. This was supposed to be a tight game. One team was stacked with superstars and Grand Final winners. The other were wearing the white of England. But don\u2019t get it twisted. They\u2019ve got plenty of big names in their ranks and every one of them glistened in Newcastle. To name the players who impressed would simply be an exercise in naming the entire England squad. They were brilliant from back to front and absolutely swept aside Samoa, who only scored thanks to an intercept. Quotes and report to follow. Stay with me for the reaction.  Updated at 4.46pm BST    4.38pm   TRY! England 60-6 Samoa (Burgess, 80)  I literally can\u2019t keep up. A 40-20 kick (completing the bingo set from a perfect match for England) means they have the ball back within touching distance of the Samoan try line. The ball stays short and big Sam Burgess gets his mitt on it. He\u2019s not passing it. Oh no. He pins the ears back and rampages from close range, getting his name on the scoresheet. Makinson slots the added two.   Updated at 4.47pm BST    4.35pm   TRY! England 54-6 Samoa (Williams, 77)  It\u2019s as if one team is on fast forward and the other is running through a vat of porridge. England are rampant. They\u2019re cutting holes in midfield, recycling the ball in the tackle, they\u2019re weaving through half gaps and finding runners aplenty. This is a brilliant team try that seemed to involve every Englishman to ever touch a rugby ball. Welsby with the cahrge and off-load, Tomkins and Makinson getting their hands on it. Ultimately it was Williams with the final contribution, scything through space and sliding over.    Updated at 5.17pm BST    4.32pm   Makinson makes it 50 (England 50-6 Samoa, 75))  After converting his own try, Makinson brings up half a century for the home side.     4.31pm   TRY! England 48-6 Samoa (Makinson, 74)  It\u2019s a try a minute. A lovely kick along the ground from Williams, perfectly timed, and Makinson gathers a tricky bouncing ball and slides over in one motion to score. So, so good from England. They\u2019ve absolutely shattered expectations.    Updated at 5.14pm BST    4.28pm    73 mins: Samoa kick the restart straight out. They\u2019re falling apart.     4.28pm   TRY! England 44-Samoa (Whitehead, 71)  Bang! BANG! That\u2019s a second try in two minutes for Whitehead. England have the ball in their own half in midfield and realise there\u2019s space on the left. They send it down the line with a skipped pass to Makinson and he wins the one-on-one battle with Crichton, staying on his feet, gathering himself and then passing infield to his right where three England supports runners are with him. Whitehead is the one who catches it and, after a glance at the referee to make sure the pass wasn\u2019t forward, he canters home to slide in for the four points. That becomes six thanks to Makinson\u2019s boot.    Updated at 4.35pm BST    4.25pm   TRY! England 38-6 Samoa (Whitehead, 69)  It\u2019s been all about England\u2019s slick backs but Whitehead has got one on the board for the bruising forwards. From close range, he dips his head down and gets over the line, riding three tacklers and muscling the ball to the deck. Makinson nudges the added two. This is becoming a rout.    Updated at 4.52pm BST    4.23pm    68 mins: Samoa have to drop out from their own goal area after Suaalii misjudges the bounce of the ball from a poked kick off the boot of Williams. The Samoan fullback is hoping to goes dead but instead it sits up. He has no choice but to grab it and Williams, chasing up, shoves him over the line. England then get a penalty after the dropout doesn\u2019t go 10m. England charge up and could have a try! Whitehead has motored over from close range. Has he burrowed down to get the score?     4.20pm   TRY! England 32-6 Samoa (Farnworth, 65)  If it wasn\u2019t before, the game is certainly over now. Farnworth has been immense and deserves to get his name on the scoresheet. England bring it towards the poles with a strong charge from Hill. With the man advantage there\u2019s an overlap on the left so that\u2019s where the ball goes. Farnworth collects on the bounce and has to regather. Rather than pass to his man on the wing he steps back inside and busts over to score. Clinical. Makinson strikes this sweetly and curls his conversion through the middle of the poles.   Updated at 4.29pm BST    4.16pm   PENALTY! England 26-6 Samoa (Makinson, 63)  Makinson just about squeezes this in off the post. It\u2019s a tricky kick out towards the right and he doesn\u2019t catch it clean, but it\u2019s clean enough and that\u2019s another two points for his team.     4.15pm   YELLOW CARD! Samoa (Milford, 63)  There can be no complaints there. That was a late, late hit, with a bit of shoulder, on Tomkins well after the ball had been shovelled on.     4.15pm    64 mins: Good passing from England. Just aboout every back was involved in this move that goes down the left. Oh. What a dirty late hit that is from Milford on Tomkins. Card coming.     4.13pm    62 mins: That\u2019s a good jinking run from Williams. Crichton collects a deep kick. Samoa have it but then drop it again. What is happening? That\u2019s Hamlin-Uele. Radley with a good tackle but it wasn\u2019t a bone cruncher. Samoa are going to have to learn how to hold on to it if they\u2019re going to beat one of the heavyweights.     4.11pm    60 mins: Dropped. Again. 5m from the line. Samoa have been their own worst enemies today. Levi pops a short ball to Papalii but they\u2019re not on the same page. Levi though the run was going right. Papalii thought the pass was going left. So he drops it. Another wasted chance.     4.09pm    58 mins: Great move off the back of a scrum from Samoa. Crichton collects on a loop around but is dragged down just short. The ball goes bacl and Sua\u2019a comes close. They\u2019re 5m out.      4.07pm    56 mins: Tago with a good carry down the left. Milford hoofs a high ball but it\u2019s not well chased or well directed so Makinson has all the time in the world to field it.  Young drops the ball and then there\u2019s a bit of argy-bargy. Samoa must be feeling frustrated, but grabbing blokes\u2019 shirts and shoving them in the chest ain\u2019t gonna solve their problems.     4.05pm    54 mins: What a tackle that is from England. That causes Samoa to drop the ball in the collision. That\u2019s been a theme of the game and mens Samoa can\u2019t reach the end of their set. So England charge upfield. A dinked kick bounces into touch right in the corner. Samoa with a long way to go again.      4.04pm    52 mins: England stretching the game a bit more, going down the left rather than bash it up the middle. There\u2019s a kick deep into Samoan territory and it\u2019s a teaser but Suaalii mops up well. Samoa work it upfield and win a penalty after an English player strays offside. The men in blue have to score next. They\u2019ve got their hands on the pill 30m out.     4.02pm   TRY! England 24-6 Samoa (Watkins, 49)  Doesn\u2019t Watkins deserve that. It starts further back as England hammer away in the midfield, trying to work the space and Cooper punches a hole and gets the ball away to Williams (I think, will come back to that). The ball isn\u2019t held but it comes off the leg so it\u2019s not deemed a knock on. England keep the ball alive down the left with short passes and Watkins straightens and beats the final challenge to dive down and score under the poles. Wilsby involved again. He\u2019s having a brilliant game. Makinson kicks the extras.    Updated at 4.10pm BST    3.58pm    46 mins: He might be a tackle buster but Suaalii has soap for hands, that\u2019s his third drop in the carry. That offers England possession inside Samoan territory. Farnworth cahrges on the right. Tomkins and Lees straighten. Oh, Farnworth gets so close, cuts back on the angle but is well tackled by Su\u2019a. Just 2m short. Ball turned over.     3.55pm    This doesn\u2019t look good. The stretcher is out and paramedics are surrounding May. That could well be his tournament. A knee or a hip, unsure at the minute. Either way, he\u2019s leaving the field on his back to the sound of applause.      3.53pm    England have been very impressive. They had to hear all week how Samoa were favourites, how they\u2019d run the, ragged. But the home side have kept things simple. Quick ball, tidy passing, (mostly) clinical finishing when given the chance. But most importantly, they\u2019ve been immense on defence. Samoa have had little room around the park.     3.52pm    45 mins: Turnover on the ground. A forced turnover from England to get the ball back. A great tackle from Watkins in the wide channel means May has nowhere to go and Welsby mops it up. May is in trouble, though, looks like a twisted kneed. That\u2019s two injuries for Samoa right at the start of their competition. When we get going again England will have the ball.     3.49pm    44 mins: Good running from England. They bring it 50-odd metres. Disciplined, nothing too fancy, good game management.      3.48pm    42: Just get the ball to Suaalii. Every time the 19 year old touches the ball he busts a tackle. What a player. Strong start for Samoa. Taupau involved. Samoa risk losing the ball by keeping their last tackle in hand and they\u2019re turned over 5m out.     3.46pm    And we\u2019re back. England with a lead to defend, Samoa with more gears to find.      3.43pm    Very. He\u2019s been very good.      3.42pm     \u201cHi Daniel. I fear we could get crucified on the wings. Hoping not though\u201d  That was from David Brown before kick off. I was on the same page but England have kept it tight and have actually been the more threatening in the wide areas. Samoa need to find their groove.     3.37pm   HALF TIME: England 18-6 Samoa  England lead by 12 points, but it could, and should have been a lot more. They were dominant throughout the half with their backs controlling it with some direct running and sharp movement. Tomkins, Watkins, Farnsworth and Welsby all heavily involved and having great games. But it\u2019s Young who has stolen the show with two cracking scores. One a 50m dart with an inside step and the other with a diving touchdown in the corner. Tago\u2019s intercept pegged one back for Samoa whgo haven\u2019t found their groove. They did come alive late in the half with Crichton coming close and Suaalii lighting up whenever he got the ball. England will want to close this out but can\u2019t let up. Catch you in a bit.     3.34pm    NO TRY! Crichton is judged to have knocked the ball on over the line. Tell you what, that was close.  Updated at 3.37pm BST    3.33pm    40 mins: Much better from Samoa. Papalii with a big charge through the middle. A Hail Mary off load is thrown and finds Suaalii who dazzles with a step, then another, then another. His long, long legs get him moving towards the try line but he\u2019s dragged just short. Samoa keep the ball and stab a kick through. Chrichton has the ball grounded over the line but they\u2019re going upstairs. Could be a try\u2026  Updated at 3.33pm BST    3.31pm    38 mins: Oh, unlucky for England. It seemed as if Makinson was set free but the ref has adjudged the inside pass from Williams to have gone forward.  Even worse luck for Tabuai-Fidow who is off the park with a suspected broken leg.     3.29pm    37 mins: Excellent from Luai who shifts right and then left and offloads in the tackle to keep Samoa moving forward. He\u2019s been their best player. Everyone else has been a little too static but that was coherent play.      3.27pm   TRY! England 18-6 Samoa (Tago, 35)  Tago has picked England\u2019s pocked and charged in for a 50m intercept try. It was Welsby\u2019s pass, and it was on, as he had a two-on-one overlap to his right, but Tago read the situation perfectly and stepped up to snatch the ball at it\u2019s apex. No one was going to catch him. Very much against the run of play but that is what Samoa needed. The extras are added. England still on top but that might prove the shot in the arm the Pacific Islanders needed.   Updated at 3.33pm BST    3.25pm    32 mins: England are relentless at the minute. Tomkins everywhere. Cooper, on from the bench, is involved as well. They kick away the ball when they have to but Samoa are right against their own line. Oh wow, they\u2019re up the field with a scintillating run from Suaalii, shrugging off tackles, motoring past his teammates and the English alike. He drops the ball though and England go back.     3.22pm   TRY! England 18-0 Samoa (Young, 30)  Behave Dom Young! Another corker! This kid is special. It\u2019s a diving, acrobatic, blockbuster finish in the right corner. He gets a great pass from Welsby, and it was poor defence from Samoa who seemed to switch off, but that is the score of a star in the making. It all started on the opposite flank with Farnworth busting up field and getting the Samoans back peddling. Welsby having a cracking game, stitching things together. Makinson misses the kick.   Updated at 3.39pm BST    3.19pm    28 mins: Radley has had a great game. He\u2019s won just about every collision on the carry. Samoa need to get things going. Paulo with a huge carry shows what they can do. But when they go wide they cough the ball up and England get it back. Samoa getting frustrated.     3.17pm   TRY! England 14-0 Samoa (Young, 25)  STUNNER! What a try! Oh my word. Dom Young, that is why he\u2019s had so much hype around his name. He gets the ball on the right touchline right on his own own half and puts on the after burners, he cuts inside, makes eyes with Suaalii and absolutely skins him, shifting through the gears on the inside and dives over for the score. What an absolutely brilliant try. Makinson with the added two.    Updated at 3.26pm BST    3.13pm   TRY! England 8-0 Samoa (Welsby, 23)  That\u2019s what happens when you bust through a tackle. Williams gets the pass against the grain and burst through a challenge. Welsby running a superb line on the inside gets it back and canters home unopposed. Direct running the secret to their success there. Wonderful score from England. Watkins involved too to get the move going.   Makinson makes it look easy and adds the cherry on the top.  Updated at 3.29pm BST    3.09pm    21 mins: Paulo, a hawuuuge human being, charges up field. A grubber kick from Samoa is stolen so England get back up field. Radley wriggles some space and England hoof the ball back into Samoan territory.  Levi is now injecting more pace around the tackle for Samoa and getting his ball carriers on the charge.      3.07pm    19 mins: Neat step from Williams opens space on the left but a poor kick from England is intercepted and Samoa go cantering up field. They get up to English territory but continue to look disjointed. I\u2019m not really sure what their game plan is. They get nowhere and have to kick. Tomkins collects well under the high ball and sets off on a counter. He\u2019s having a good game. Later he hoists a high kick that Samoa gather without much fuss.  It all ends in a Samoan penalty deep in theor own half.  It\u2019s a frantic pace but it\u2019s not very cohesive from either side. Still jabbing, rather than throwing knockout punches.     3.03pm    15 mins: It\u2019s a great tackle from Watkins and McMeekan teaming up on Luai that resulted in the turnover. Really good from Watkins. England\u2019s ball on their own 22 out on the right.     3.02pm    15 mins: Samoa finding front foot ball. Papalii heavily involved, busting through tackles. Samoa get a fresh set of six and have crept inside the England 22. But there\u2019s a knock on on the left just as they start to string some passes together. Disjointed is the word.     3.00pm    14 mins: Samoa\u2019s attack isn\u2019t clicking. They might be stacked with superstars but they\u2019re struggling for cohesion. They don\u2019t seem to have a plan and it\u2019s all first phase rugby at the minute. England\u2019s scrambling defence keeps them at arm\u2019s length.      2.58pm   Burgess dots down, but does he?  They\u2019re going back upstairs because Burgess has reached out and slammed the ball over the line, basketball style. But is he in control of the ball? Does he have enough downward force for it to count? The answer to both is no. No try.     2.57pm    13 mins: Watkins with a strong carry up field. Radley, oh what a game he\u2019s having, finds space on the left. Williams steps back inside and off loads to Hill who gets within touching distance. Tompkins picks up and makes a dart for the score under the poles but is held up, he can\u2019t put it down. England really need to convert these chances. Great defence from Samoa under the sticks. England having great joy with the big fellas through the middle.     2.55pm    11 mins: Barnstorming run from Burgess, carrying two tacklers on his back takes it within 7m. It goes left with Radley looking for space. Williams with another short ball to Burgess who comes within touching distance. It fizzles out with a kick through partially blocked and Samoa have it back on their own line. England bossing it.     2.53pm    10 mins: A little chip from Watkins is spilled inside Samoa\u2019s 22 so England will have the ball.     2.52pm    8 mins: Good start from England. They\u2019ve found their groove. The big units are punching holes in midfield but they\u2019re forced to punt it back to Samoa.  A strong run from Levi gets his team moving forward. But they kick it back to England. Missed opportunity after creating space on the left but they kept it direct and straight down the middle.  Updated at 3.16pm BST    2.50pm    Wow. More delays. This time there\u2019s an issue with the ball being used. Honestly, this sport doesn\u2019t help itself sometimes.      2.49pm   PENALTY! England 2-0 Samoa (Makinson, 6)  Easy as you like for Tommy Makinson who slots the simple shot at goal. First points of the World Cup go to England.     2.48pm    Yup, no try. But a penalty for England right in front of the poles for obstruction off the ball. Great work from England. That was Whitehead who was taken out.     2.47pm   They're going upstairs  Farnworth is on the end of a stabbed kick through. I reckon he\u2019s got this. Oh no, he\u2019s knocked it on in the try area. No try, but could still be a penalty.     2.45pm    4 mins: Samoa kick the ball out so England have the ball back. Samoa look bigger in defence and through the middle currently. But Tompkins involved again gets the ball right to Young who finds space on the outside.  They get a full set 20m out and Williams cuts against the grain and brings it within 10m.  Tompkins is everywhere. Williams to short pass to Hill, there\u2019s a kick through on the last tackle of the set and has that been grounded!!??     2.43pm    2 mins: Samoa receive the kick and keep it down the middle, hammering at the door and making almost 40m before the kick it. They kick and Tompkins run it back up. England kick themselves and Samoa have the ball back in their own half. Both teams just jabbing at the minute.     2.40pm    Right then. I\u2019m pumped after that. We\u2019re crawling to a start but I\u2019m still pumped. Here. We. GO!     2.38pm    Oh, but before we do, it\u2019s the Samoan Siva Tau, their version of the New Zealand Haka for those who don\u2019t know. It starts with one man standing in a ring of his mates all kneeling, facing inward. He\u2019s chanting with gusto, challenging the English, calling on his comrades to rise with him and they do so, turn around to face their opponents, marching towards them. Wow, that is powerful! They\u2019re close, not quite nose to nose as they bellow \u201cSAMOA\u201d. Scratch that, one or two do get nose to nose. That was sensational. Forget an opening ceremony. That was spine tingling. ABSOLUTE SCENES!    Updated at 2.54pm BST    2.34pm    They\u2019ve got it working! The gremlins in the machine have been booted out. The anthems are in full swing. The players are shoulder to shoulder. The crowd looks incredible! Seconds away.   Updated at 3.02pm BST    2.32pm    However, if they can\u2019t get the PA system going, that probably means there won\u2019t be any national anthems. Imagine getting picked for your country to play the opening game of a World Cup and you don\u2019t get to sing your anthem? I really hope they can make a plan.     2.31pm    Some movement now from the players in the dressing room. Seems we may get going soon.     2.29pm    No notes. [chef kiss emoji]. Just delicious.      2.27pm    In the meantime, get a load of this champion! How can Samoa lose with this titan carrying the flag?      2.26pm    Ricky Wilson has no resorted to running around in front of the crowd who must be fuming.  Scenes of the players in the dressing room who have gone through their warmup, timed to the exact time, ready to tear lumps out of each other. What happens to them now? If we see a tweaked muscle we might know why.   Updated at 2.59pm BST    2.24pm    It\u2019s actually a farce. What a dreadful start to the World Cup. The Kaiser Chiefs band members are waving their hands around. The kids involved in the prematch ceremony look confused. We\u2019re all confused. The PA system has failed and now we\u2019ll get a delayed start to the match. Shambles. <!-- Invalid tweet without \"html\" field --> <!-- Invalid tweet without \"html\" field -->     2.21pm    Seems like that\u2019s been sorted. The trophies are being taken out, Jason Robinson is clutching one side of the one that will be handed out the men\u2019s winners. It\u2019s all a little plodding right now. Apparently \u2018Ruby, Ruby, Ruby\u2019 will be performed by the Kaisers before the rugby takes place. Nothing like a bloated opening ceremony to really get you in the mood for some sport, eh?     2.20pm    There\u2019s a problem with the PA system! Oh dear. That is a real failure to launch. How does that happen?     2.18pm    The trophies are now being shown off. They\u2019re not the prettiest trinkets, I think that\u2019s fair to say. Pretty standard silverware. There\u2019s a bit of a hold up and those holding the sizeable trophies must keep holding them up. Not sure what\u2019s causing the delay.     2.14pm    \u201cOh my god I can\u2019t believe it,\u201d belts out Ricky Wilson of the Kaiser Chiefs. I mean, me too. This whole jamboree was in doubt but now we\u2019re finally here. After five years we\u2019ve got a World Cup on our hands! Not long now. All the flags of all the nations are being brought out to the middle of the field. There\u2019s Brazil, Jamaica, Cook Islands, Spain, USA, Greece. Wonderful.     2.10pm    Today\u2019s guest of honour at St James\u2019 Park is a genuine hero. That word gets tossed around in sport quite a bit, but Rob Burrow is all that and more. Last year he chatted to Don McRae and that piece is well worth a revisit:      2.05pm    The Beeb are focussing on Luke Thompson, who\u2019ll come off the bench, and the rest of the English pack. For all the chat around the flyers out wide, there is a sense that this opening game, with so much riding on it, might see both sides look to punch holes in the middle and keep it (relatively safe). As always, the side that dominates those tighter channels will have the ascendancy.     2.02pm    I\u2019ve been hyping up Dom Youngs in particular, but is there anything more exciting in sport than a young tearaway with pace to burn? In case you needed reminding, here\u2019s the report from his blockbuster performance against Fiji last Friday:      1.59pm   NRL stars give Samoa a boost  19-year old Joseph Suaalii, try-machine Brian To\u2019o and a host of others game changers are stacked in this star-studded side. This is unquestionably the best Samoan side of all time. The only question is, has coach Matt Parish done enough to get them singing from the same sheet? Samoa: Suaalii, Tabuai-Fidow, Tago, Chrichton, To\u2019o, Luai, Milford, Papalii, Levi, Paulo, Su\u2019a, Aloiai, Tuilagi Substitutes: Taupau, Leniu, Harris-Tavita, May     1.49pm   England name strong side with Dom Young on the wing  Yup, as expected, youngster Dom Young, will start in the wing (no matter what the BBC\u2019s on screen image stated). Here\u2019s how they\u2019ll line up: England: Tomkins, Makinson, watkins, Farnworth, Young, Welsby, Williams, Burgess, McIlorum, Thompson, Radley, Whitehead, Knowles Substitutes: Lees, Cooper, Hill, McMeekan    Updated at 1.54pm BST    1.48pm    Is there a more exciting young player in the game than England\u2019s Dom Young? The 21-year-old who scores tries for fun down in New South Wales for the Newcastle Knights will will almost certainly make his Test debut today.      1.39pm    Five years ago, England fell to Australia in the final, going down 6-0 in Brisbane. Tom Burgess was there and he\u2019s still hurting. He told Aaron Bower all about that pain, and why it\u2019s fuelling his drive to make things right this time:      1.30pm   Preamble  Folks, we made it. After so many false starts, after the a global plague threatened to scupper it entirely, after five long years since the last one, we\u2019re within touching distance of a Rugby League World Cup! This latest iteration, played on English soil for the first time since 2013, could well be the most competitive yet. The hosts will fancy their chances. Skipper Sam Tomkins told the BBC this week that his team is \u201chere to win it,\u201d but they\u2019ll have stiff competition, not least from their opponents today in Newcastle. Samoa are a team on the rise. Some bookies have them edging England, an unthinkable notion 12 months ago. But this is not the Samoan side of yesteryear. They\u2019re stacked with players born in Australia and New Zealand but with Samoan heritage who have opted to represent the land of their forbears. Brian To\u2019o might have walked into the Aussie starting line-up but will pose a challenge on the Samoan wing instead. His two tries helped Penrith Panthers lift the NRL title earlier this month in a squad that bow boasts five other Samoan internationals. This should be a tournament like no other, and it has the perfect matchup to get is going. Of course it\u2019s not the only one, with a women\u2019s edition and a first ever wheelchair competition to follow as well. St James\u2019 Park is bathed in glorious sunshine with the sport illuminated in an unprecedented glow. My name is Daniel. Do get in touch with a tweet or an email. Kick off is at 2:30pm.

                    "body": "So, about that underdogs tag. There is no need to be an expert to know that nothing is won on the opening day of a tournament but after a buildup where England\u2019s prospects were roundly downplayed and the hype around Samoa was so great they were favourites with the bookies, this was some way to lay down a marker for the next five weeks. Supporters probably could not help fear the worst pre-match, though. With the public address system failing and the opening ceremony \u2013 which had been rehearsed to perfection three times in the morning \u2013 being cut short. The sight of the Kaiser Chiefs singer, Ricky Wilson, running up and down the touchline to try to lift spirits before slipping on the turf could easily have felt like a worrying precursor for an underwhelming day all-round.  Nobody needed to worry as England were in no mood to let the opening day of a tournament years in the making be remembered as a damp squib. Samoa, stacked with the best of the NRL and several Grand Final winners, were hamstrung by injuries that could have an effect further down the line. But they, like everyone else, could have no complaints about the outcome and the final scoreline. Shaun Wane\u2019s message all week was clear when asked about the hype surrounding Samoa as potential winners of the whole thing. Let people talk other nations up all they want: his England side would do their talking on the field and that became reality as they emphatically underlined why they should be regarded as a real threat to go all the way with a performance of complete dominance. \u201cNobody gave us a chance to win the game,\u201d the England coach said. \u201cBut within our group we knew what we can do. We enjoyed all that negativity, to be honest. \u201cWe\u2019re just happy to do what we do, whatever people comment. That\u2019s up to them. We\u2019re not going round thinking we can\u2019t improve, though, because we have to get better.\u201d This game would in effect decide who finished top of Group A, setting up a supposed easier route to the final. With games against France and the debutants Greece to come over the next fortnight, it should be three wins from three for England and a quarter\u2011final against the runners-up in Group D, probably Papua New Guinea. Samoa, assuming they beat France and Greece, would now need to get past Tonga to reach the last four. With key players Braden Hamlin-Uele, Tyrone May, who dislocated his hip at the start of the second half, and Hamiso Tabuai-Fidow suffering injuries that could end their involvement, they are now firmly up against it. \u201cThe English team played very well,\u201d said their coach, Matt Parish. \u201cWe had a few injuries and setbacks we didn\u2019t handle as well as we could.\u201d This was a performance of near-perfection from England. It was not without its moments of trepidation, though, not least when Izack Tago intercepted a Jack Welsby pass on the stroke of half-time. England were leading 18-0 and, had Samoa scored first after half-time, the prospect of an opening-day comeback, and England falling short in front of a bumper home crowd of more than 43,000, could have become a distinct possibility.  But England swiftly ended any lingering doubts. Welsby and his half-back partner, George Williams, were influential but one could have singled any England player out for praise. That includes Dom Young, the 6ft 7in 21-year-old winger who marked his Test debut with two first-half tries after a fine opener from Welsby. If the first half was impressive, the second was barely believable. With England\u2019s lead just 12, the first try after half-time was huge. When Kallum Watkins scored after another scintillating move, it put his side in complete control. By that stage Samoa were down to one fit interchange and, when the half-back Anthony Milford was sent to the sin-bin with 17 minutes to go, the floodgates opened. England scored 36 points in that final passage. Herbie Farnworth was first to cross before Elliott Whitehead, another outstanding performer, crossed for two tries in four minutes.  With Milford off the field, Samoa fell apart and the final 10 minutes felt like England were cutting their opponents open at will. Tommy Makinson, who kicked 10 goals, finished another team move before Williams capped a fine display with a try of his own. The final try came from the prop Tom Burgess, who barged over a tired defence. As opening-day performances go, it is hard to imagine a better one than this."

                    "body": "When British journalists were writing about the treatment of migrant workers building World Cup stadiums, they might have expected to receive a phone call from a Qatari based in Doha, pushing back on their accusations. Instead, newspapers found themselves being contacted by Britons such as George Pascoe\u2011Watson, a former political editor of the Sun, challenging the premise of their story and offering a more pro-Qatari viewpoint.\nPascoe-Watson is a senior partner at Portland, a high-end London-based public relations and lobbying company founded by Tim Allan, a former adviser to Tony Blair. It is one of many British\u2011based firms who benefited from spinning on behalf of the Qatari government before the World Cup, pushing the Gulf nation\u2019s case in the media, and arguing against negative coverage.\nBecause while England once again failed to win the World Cup, London\u2019s lobbyists and lawyers working on the competition have done their best to ensure a fortune\u2019s coming home.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s been a very well\u2011organised and well-resourced campaign in place,\u201d said Nicholas McGeehan, a longtime campaigner on migrant workers\u2019 rights in the region. \u201cArguments have been constructed very effectively to deflect attention from fair and proportionate criticism.\u201d\nOne of the reasons for the heavy presence of British PR representatives is that criticism of Qatar\u2019s bid \u2013 whether the alleged corruption (denied by Qatar) involved in securing the hosting rights, the treatment of migrant workers, or its lack of LGBTQ+ rights \u2013 has been led by UK newspapers such as the Guardian and the Sunday Times. While German and Scandinavian news outlets have also investigated these issues, it is the English-language media which are easier to read around the world.\nPortland declined to comment on the nature of its work in Qatar, although it has an office in Doha and has been working on various Qatari-related contracts since at least 2014. Early challenges included dealing with the detention of a BBC journalist in the country and helping to set up a blog that criticised opponents of the country hosting the tournament. But as time progressed, journalists reporting on the World Cup preparations said the efforts to improve Qatar\u2019s image in the British press became smarter and more subtle.\n\nIn particular, they receive pushback from representatives of Hassan al-Thawadi, the secretary general of the World Cup\u2019s organising committee. He is a Qatari national who attended sixth-form college in Scunthorpe before studying law at the University of Sheffield and is said to take British criticism personally. One British reporter who has dealt with Thawadi claimed: \u201cHe\u2019s absolutely convinced that he\u2019s this liberal guy who really cares about workers\u2019 rights and conditions. He\u2019s mortified that the world would think of him as just another uncaring Qatari. He phones his PR people in fury each time there\u2019s a negative headline about what\u2019s happening in Qatar being down to him. And he may be less worse than the vast majority of the Qatari elite, because they don\u2019t care about migrant workers.\u201d\nWith UK newspapers often uploading their stories to their websites around midnight, newsdesks became used to Qataris on a different time zone waking up in the early hours of the morning and demanding alterations.\nOne Briton who played an important role in the World Cup press operation is Richard Conway, who as a BBC Sport correspondent in 2018 produced an upbeat report on the preparations for the Qatar World Cup while riding a camel across the desert. A few months later he left journalism to form his own PR agency and has been working exclusively on the Qatar World Cup for several years. Journalists who have dealt with him say he has adopted a hands-off approach, acting as an informal conduit and enabling conversations by inviting critics of the World Cup and prominent newspaper journalists to off-the-record meetings with senior Qatari officials at London hotels. \nMany Britons also work for the Qatari division of Teneo Blue Rubicon, a PR agency that has worked hard to promote the country, while journalists who have written critically about the country have also received legal letters from the law firm Carter Ruck. Neither company returned a request for comment on the nature of their work in the country.\nOne of the gripes among Qatari officials is that they have received criticism for adopting similar tactics to regional rivals such as Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. The Guardian has previously reported on extravagantly funded events held in London where MPs and former footballers received large fees from an unknown source, all with the intention of building opposition to the Qatar World Cup. The organiser of that event also approached the former Conservative election chief Sir Lynton Crosby \u2013 whose company already conducted work for Saudi Arabia \u2013 and discussed a \u00a35.5m influence campaign to strip Qatar of the right to host the World Cup.\nThose nations also spent tens of millions of pounds on lobbying campaigners aimed at western politicians and media outlets, with Qatar feeling they had the right to fight fire with fire.\nDespite this, there\u2019s little doubt among Qatar\u2019s critics that the decision to host the World Cup has ultimately transformed the country\u2019s global standing in the media. Low expectations and ethical concerns were ultimately dialled down in media coverage as the football began. Paid influencers have flooded TikTok with upbeat stories from Doha.\nAnd according to McGeehan, who now runs the FairSquare NGO, one of the most effective tactics during the tournament has been to argue that criticism of Qatar is Orientalism, or anti-Arab: \u201cA good PR person understands how that is going to play well with particular audiences who are sensitive to charges like that. It led to people who would normally be considered as allies in this to essentially engage in the counter-debate, rather than the debate what the issues are.\u201d"

                    "body": "On arrival at Perth airport last week, wicketkeeper Matthew Wade said that his team\u2019s heavy loss to England in last year\u2019s Twenty20 World Cup group stage was \u201cthe lightbulb moment\u201d that made the Australians change the way they approached the format and go on to win that tournament. A week after Wade spoke in Perth, having endured three more beltings by England in the interim, it is reasonable to wonder whether the lightbulb is flickering. Only rain in the final match could turn whitewash to washout. The first two matches took different routes to identical margins of eight runs, once when England\u2019s batting blitzed a score of over 200, then when the cleverness of England\u2019s bowling defended a more modest score.  In the third match it was adaptability that had England on top, the batters walking back after two rain delays to loot 39 runs from the final 14 balls of a shortened innings. Josh Hazlewood is Australia\u2019s standard-bearer for Test bowling, the tall quick with the accuracy to hitting a coin on the pitch, and who has more recently adapted his game to suit 20-over cricket. Jos Buttler is England\u2019s captain, and currently the shortest format\u2019s most consistently destructive batter in the world. It felt symbolic to see Buttler calmly eviscerating a Hazlewood over, picking slower ball from full pace with a yawn in his throat, placing the fuller balls through the off side and the marginally shorter ones over leg to collect 22 runs from six shots. Then there was England\u2019s swing bowler Chris Woakes, a man whose glum Ashes visits have seen him take a wicket in Australia every 95 balls, starting up on this damp Canberra evening to find movement and create catches from the first two deliveries of the match. The DLS score adjustment had set Australia 130 to win, meaning that the required run rate soon exceeded 12 per over. The home team was gone, even before more rain. None of which is to say that Australia got much wrong. They go into the upcoming World Cup with an excellent best XI and an adaptable squad. It\u2019s just that right now, England look a better side on paper and on grass. The same was true at last year\u2019s tournament, when they were stacked with batting power top to tail while Australia had frailties exposed. The path to that trophy didn\u2019t rely on finding a way to beat England, it relied on avoiding them. New Zealand offered a trans-Tasman favour by maintaining the historical role of New Zealand cricket: being a giant-killer against everybody else before falling apart against Australia. So the old rivalry is set at an interesting point with this year\u2019s tournament about to start. All three of the aforementioned teams are in the same group, with Afghanistan and two qualifiers that will most likely be Sri Lanka along with Ireland or Zimbabwe. Don\u2019t discount the Sri Lankans, who recorded some stirring wins across all three formats against Australia in June and July before storming on to win the Asia Cup. But as usual most eyes will be on Australia versus England, first in the group stage and then possibly again in the knockouts. By then, memories of warm-up matches will be distant. Everything starts fresh in a big tournament as you wait for the umpire to call play. But there are still aspects of significance that could carry over. England\u2019s batters have shown no fear of the blue-chip pace trio of Cummins, Starc, Hazlewood. Buttler regards all bowling as there to be scored from, and his players follow his lead. England\u2019s bowlers fancy themselves against Australia\u2019s top order, and can find ways to suppress explosions from the middle. And on a longer timeline, Australian teams find ways to win the big moments even when by rights they should not. The dynamics between certain teams within a tournament context can be fascinating. Take Pakistan losing to India at World Cups for decades, and the eruption of delight when they finally broke that streak last October. The objective quality of sides outside tournaments is not always reflected in certain match-ups within them. England\u2019s era of white-ball excellence from 2015 to now has not landed the biggest T20 prize, and last year\u2019s World Cup did nothing to settle whether it made them a better side than Australia: if a World Cup match makes the warm-up fade to nothing, a final makes the group stage do the same. In 2022, after a long wait, a knockout meeting would be a satisfying path to closure."

                    "body": "And here\u2019s one we made earlier. Please ignore the noises from the basement. We, the sovereign state of Qatar, are here to restore the lost soul of your prized social-sporting institutions. And it\u2019s all going to be fine. There was an unavoidable significance this week in the coincidence of two apparently unrelated events. First the suggestion that Qatar really may have a serious interest in buying Manchester United, or at least enough interest to add its name to the list before Friday\u2019s \u201csoft\u201d deadline. And second the deliciously more-ish scenes of chaos at Paris Saint-Germain as the current Qatari football project confirmed its status as the most thrillingly grotesque entity in European club football.  It is worth stating this simply: Qatar buying United would be an absolute disaster for the team, the Premier League and Uefa. And not just for reasons such as human rights abuses, which nobody really seems to care about, or the fact nation-state ownership is by definition unhealthy, and foreign policy never benign. In the end none of this really seems to cut through. What makes an impact is basic footballing competence. We hear talk already of how \u201cclassy\u201d Newcastle\u2019s Saudi owners are, which is no doubt a huge comfort to those the state has classily beheaded, or gay people in Saudi being (classily) tortured. If this is what really counts then we do have a model of what being owned by Qatar looks like. Witness the state of PSG, a job interview for the role of Manchester United owner so inept it serves to be ranked up there with the one where you accidentally called the senior partner of a magic circle law firm \u201cDad\u201d or punched the head of HR in the clavicle going for a handshake. Qatar is, of course, more than just one thing. Past incompetence is no guarantee of future balls-ups. No doubt the relevant \u201cfund\u201d would build some really good bridges in Salford and generally machine-gun this thing with money. But the fact remains Qatar has made a mind-numbingly awful hash of running PSG in a way that would play specifically to United\u2019s own vices and destroy in an instant the cautious progress made under Erik ten Hag. It is easy to lose track of the sheer level of inanity and dysfunction at PSG. But it was there in its many shades before, during and after the 1-0 defeat by Bayern Munich in Paris on Tuesday, an occasion when the team looked more than ever like a version of football as reimagined by an uncompromising nine-year-old video game enthusiast. The culture at the club is perhaps best summed up by the \u201cbien manger, bien dormir\u201d affair that has dominated PSG celebrity gossip channels in the days since. This was a comment made by Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 to Canal+ after the game, urging his teammates to eat and sleep properly before the return in Munich, taken as a public slap-down of Neymar, who seems unusually intent on having late-night parties at his house in Bougival. Most recently there was his birthday party (Neymar is, lest we forget, eight years old) plus other boisterous shindigs that have led the Bougival mayor to describe Neymar as \u201ca disrespectful individual\u201d who is \u201cprodigiously annoying\u201d.  Which seems fair enough and indeed demonstrably true. It also captures perfectly a club that has come to mirror its ownership, not so much a sporting enterprise as a kind of royal court, a power struggle between princelings and dukes, where Sir Kylian, demi- emir of Paris, is free to fritter away his surplus brilliance overseeing his sub-empire. The day after that potential season-ending defeat, it just kept rolling on. A round of key power meetings were breathlessly staged, meetings that seemed of more consequence than the actual game: Lionel Messi\u2019s dad and the club board; Todd Boehly and Nasser al-Khelaifi. Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani and Emmanuel Macron at the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace. All of it confirming a sense of a sporting institution that is essentially a celebrity gossip mag made flesh (What Kiki Really Said To Ney!). The wider frustration here is that this just feels like such a vast and pointless waste, making a silly star show out of a one-city club that could be something profound, that sits at the centre of the most stupendous player production model of the age, that has the banlieues as its feeding ground, that has boundless funds and time to develop a player culture. Instead we have this. A celebrity construct that has already wrecked the European transfer system once, that seems to no longer hide its political influence, which just keeps chewing its way through good and thorough managers because all must be subservient to the egotism of star players. Which brings us back to United and to Erik. Why have things begun to settle? Because just enough power and authority has been given to a serious, ascetic man who cares only about football, who has lanced some of the celebrity waxwork stuff, who has invested in a useful Dutch beanpole, who has publicly disciplined Marcus Rashford, then publicly backed him, then made him into the high-grade homegrown standard bearer he was always meant to be.  Nothing has been achieved yet but just look at the easy gains, the uplift from simply trusting in a serious, competent person and neglecting the fripperies. Throwing Qatar at this thing would demand the opposite model, the one to which United have already been vulnerable as a grand old club trading off its past. It is as though the engine crew of the Titanic have finally worked out how to stop this thing listing into the waves, only to be informed that their new captain is a horse in a top hat who has decided to set sail immediately for the nearest and sparkliest ice shelf. Plus it would be disastrous for Uefa, which has described the multi-club ownership model as a threat to football\u2019s \u201cintegrity\u201d but has no real power to stop it when a fund can just become another fund. Not to mention deeply uncomfortable for the Premier League, which has charged Manchester City with offences allegedly related to connected sponsorships. Welcome, National Bank of Qatar! And yet for all the potential barriers the fact remains this thing will happen if the emir wants it. This is how football works, how deregulated industries work, how energy dependence on Qatar works. In which case the current, fragile little age of Erik may just come to look like its own brief shaft of light."

He referred to the host nation Qatar as \u201ca desert country with an oppressive regime and a terrible human rights record\u201d where homosexuality is illegal, in other words \u201cit\u2019s like if Ron Desantis had oil\u201d. To protest this, seven countries saw their captains trying to wear rainbow armbands that said one love. In response, Fifa said it would give a yellow card to anyone doing this as well as ordering Belgium to remove the word love from their shirts. \u201cThey\u2019re banning love and rainbows,\u201d Colbert said. \u201cBasically Fifa is the bad guy in a Care Bears movie.\u201d This week also saw the Iranian team stay silent during the national anthem to protest the country\u2019s violent and misogynist regime. Colbert said it was \u201cincredibly brave or they forgot the words\u201d. After years of attempts, we may finally get to see Donald Trump\u2019s taxes after the supreme court voted against another attempt to suppress them, a case that has been going on since 2019, a year when \u201cN95 was just a bingo number\u201d and \u201cPete Davidson was dating Kate Beckinsale\u201d. This Thanksgiving has been renamed \u201cdanksgiving\u201d by some as so many states have now legalised weed but Colbert warned that it \u201ccould be a gateway to harder holidays like Crackmas, Rosh Hashanah and St Patrick\u2019s Day\u201d. The first licences for recreational marijuana have also finally been produced in New York. \u201cNew Yorkers are gonna be so excited to finally try marijuana,\u201d Colbert joked. Seth Meyers  On Late Night, Seth Meyers spoke about Joe Biden\u2019s annual turkey pardoning quoting a joke he made: \u201cThe only red wave this season would be if his dog knocked over the cranberry sauce.\u201d He responded with a groan: \u201cToo bad his dog didn\u2019t have the presence of mind to knock over the microphone.\u201d Meyers also added that it \u201cwould be the slowest wave ever\u201d before revealing the true meaning of Thanksgiving: \u201cGetting high with your weird cousins when things get too tense inside.\u201d Biden has said that he will make a decision about running for 2024 in the month between Thanksgiving and Christmas. \u201cWhatever you think of him, it\u2019s impressive that an 80-year-old man is planning that far ahead,\u201d he said. \u201cIf I was 80 I don\u2019t think I\u2019d plan on bingeing a show that had more than one season.\u201d Maxwell Frost, the first Gen Z member of Congress, has said that he believes that Biden does adequately represent the values of his generation. Meyers agreed as he \u201calso knows what it\u2019s like to live in a house you\u2019ll never own\u201d. Jimmy Kimmel  On Jimmy Kimmel Live!, the host also spoke about Trump\u2019s taxes. \u201cWe may actually finally maybe get to see what Darth Tax Evader has been hiding from us,\u201d he joked. He said that Trump was very upset and played a montage of the times he has promised to release his taxes which is \u201cmore times than he promised to release Melania\u201d. This week also saw a report that Trump\u2019s team is requesting that the FBI return personal items that were seized from Mar-a-Lago, including golf shirts and multiple pictures of Celine Dion. \u201cIs it possible he\u2019s even weirder than we thought he was?\u201d Kimmel asked Trump is also reportedly \u201cpissed\u201d that Republicans don\u2019t want him to help the controversial Georgian candidate Herschel Walker as he prepares for a runoff as it could hurt his chances. \u201cHerschel Walker doesn\u2019t need Donald Trump out there to make him look bad, he\u2019s doing a very good job of that himself,\u201d he joked. This week also saw the annual arrival of the Christmas tree to the White House, \u201ca presidential tradition since Joe Biden was a teenager in 1889\u201d."

                    "body": "It was a night when England succeeded in doing one thing: dousing the expectations that had built so suddenly after the thrashing of Iran in their opening World Cup tie. The stalemate means they will almost certainly qualify for the last 16 \u2013 only a heavy defeat against Wales next Tuesday would derail them \u2013 but there was precious little else to quicken the pulse.\nEngland were flat, moving the ball backwards and sideways too often. They could not get around the blue shirts of the United States, failing to stretch them and it very quickly turned into a slog, marked by a lack of imagination.\nHarry Kane had one early sighting and a huge chance late on \u2013 a free header from Luke Shaw\u2019s curling free-kick that he headed wide. But that was the sum total of England\u2019s threat on a night when the USA were the better team, impressing with their shape and discipline. They had the opportunities to have nicked it.\n\nGregg Berhalter\u2019s team seemed to realise midway through the first half that they had England under control; there was little for them to worry about. And they set about getting on to the front foot, asking questions, making the England support squirm, at times. How different it could have been if Weston McKennie had shown greater composure on 26 minutes when addressing a shot on the bounce. He blazed high.\nThe USA will take tremendous heart into their showdown with Iran in the final round of group games. On this evidence they will back themselves to get the win they need.\n\nThe England inquest will rage \u2013 they normally do \u2013 and there were boos from some fans at the final whistle. There were shades of the 0-0 with Scotland in the second tie at Euro 2020 and, in the final analysis, Gareth Southgate could be relieved that his team did not lose. The Iran result had offered a basis to fire momentum. Here there was only a reality check. The hope had to be that it would not be a bad thing.\nHistory had been a part of the equation. How many times had England previously beaten the USA at major tournaments, Southgate asked on Thursday. The answer was never. There had been two World Cup ties \u2013 the notorious defeat in 1950 and the underwhelming draw in 2010.\nSouthgate stuck with the starting lineup and system from the Iran game as he sought to end the hoodoo \u2013 back four and a progressive midfield (in theory). But it simply did not happen for them.\n\nEngland wanted to open up the USA with quick, short passes and slick movements and they worked a decent opening at the outset, which might have brought a goal for Kane. Kieran Trippier and Jude Bellingham combined to free Bukayo Saka and Kane\u2019s eyes lit up when the ball was pulled back. His shot, though, was blocked by Walker Zimmerman. Saka flickered in the early running. It was to be a false dawn.\nEngland\u2019s patterns came to look predictable; they played mainly in front of the USA and it was difficult to remember anybody beating a blue shirt. The USA held a high backline and squeezed in midfield, their pressure on the man in possession a major irritant to England. Southgate\u2019s team groped for inspiration.\n\nWhat a scene it was in the desert north of Doha, some way north in the city of Al Khor, the stadium resembling a giant tent from the outside and a vast amphitheatre inside \u2013 too vast, plainly, to sell all the tickets. There were empty seats dotted all over.\nWith the retractable roof open, a cool breeze circulated. Southgate had noted how some of his best football experiences had come on nights like these, the colours vivid, the pitch pristine. This was not one of them.\nThe manager had predicted that the USA would bring a ferocious intensity but it was a measured approach from them, well structured and, as England stalled, Berhalter\u2019s team made their move. It was the USA who called the tune in the second half of the first period and they had the chances to break the deadlock. Clear chances, too.\n\nThe big one followed a low cross from the right and there was McKennie, sniffing out space. His first-time shot was high and wasteful. Christian Pulisic bought a yard from Trippier and unloaded a shot from the left that rattled the crossbar and the Chelsea winger would surely like his time again when he rose unmarked to meet a cross from the right. The connection was scruffy, the ball coming off his shoulder and flying off target.\nShaw teed up Saka, who lifted high, towards the end of the half and Mason Mount extended Matt Turner but England had to do more.\nThe USA grew in assurance. Their supporters turned up the volume and Pulisic urged them to rouse themselves further when he took a succession of second-half corners. He believed the breakthrough was coming.\nEngland lived a little dangerously on those corners, surviving with last-ditch headers. Jordan Pickford flapped at another. The USA counter-press became a defining motif of the game and it was startling to think, as the clock reached the halfway point of the second half, that England had barely got out of their half since the restart. The energy came from the USA, particularly Tyler Adams, a blaze of industry in front of the defence.\nSouthgate shuffled his pack, making changes, looking for a better balance. It said everything that he withdrew two of his stars from the Iran game \u2013 Bellingham and Saka. It was not their night. Jack Grealish showed a bit of personality on the ball but could England find some incision? Marcus Rashford, another substitute, curled straight at Turner and, at the very end, there was Kane. He was horribly off target."

                    "body": "For half an hour, romance had trumped realism. As Australia romped to a 17-0 lead over New Zealand, with 19-year-old Bienne Terita scoring two tries in only her second Test, and the evergreen Sharni Williams cutting holes in midfield in her fourth World Cup, we began to wonder if maybe, just maybe, conventional wisdom could be suspended and give way to something magical. Maybe a rag-tag group of amateurs could beat one of the sport\u2019s powerhouses. Maybe money wasn\u2019t the key ingredient to success. Maybe a World Cup title in one code could shift the paradigm in another.  \u201cWe were obviously buzzing at the time,\u201d Terita said after breakfast at the team hotel in Whangarei, North Island, where the Wallaroos will take on Scotland in their second match of the campaign on Saturday. \u201cWe knew there was a long way to go but we thought we could hold [the lead]. We were playing so well, executing perfectly. Everything was going according to plan.\u201d But, to paraphrase Mike Tyson, everyone has a plan until Portia Woodman gets the ball. The Black Ferns winger scored the second of her three tries seven minutes after the restart to restore parity at 17-17. Six minutes later, Australia were down to 13 players when Ivania Wong and then Shannon Parry were shown yellow cards within seconds of each other. \u201cThat made the job difficult, but that\u2019s footy, sometimes it comes down to the rub of the green,\u201d Williams said. \u201cBut we\u2019re not looking for excuses for the result.\u201d The final score of 41-17 was a consequence of more than just a 10-minute spell with two players in the sin-bin. The closing stages saw a relentless stream of black waves wash over flailing bodies in gold. It was clear one side had more in the tank than the other. That\u2019s understandable given the dynamics of the two squads. New Zealand are fully professional and benefit from a year-round regime that allows for adequate rest and recovery between training sessions and after matches. The Wallaroos are comprised of teachers, physiotherapists and labourers. Their recovery time is often spent on their feet attending to their day job.  Williams and Terita are the exceptions. They\u2019re contracted with Rugby Australia\u2019s sevens programme and enjoy all the advantages of a full-time rugby life. It is no coincidence that they are also World Cup champions, having lifted the title in Cape Town last month. \u201cYou don\u2019t think of those things when you\u2019re on the field,\u201d Williams said. \u201cBut I guess it does show what\u2019s possible with proper investment and support. We\u2019re hoping that our success can rub off on the squad. But not just this squad. The Wallabies as well. We were flying the flag for Australian rugby. We showed that we can win tournaments. \u201cThat is what you try to embrace, that winning mentality. We try to get other people to believe in what they\u2019re capable of. When you don\u2019t play a lot of footy constantly, it can be easy to put limitations on yourself. That is what BB [Terita] and I bring. We train every single day. We\u2019ve got the belief because we know what is possible.\u201d Williams is not only a potent weapon from outside centre, capable of unlocking defences with a well-timed run against the grain or sending the ball wide at pace. She also considers herself a key communicator in the team, a bridge between what has come before and what the future holds. At the last World Cup in Ireland in 2017, Williams played at university grounds in front of a few thousand people. On Saturday, she took part in an exhibition that set the attendance record for a women\u2019s rugby match as more than 40,000 fans packed Eden Park. \u201cI find myself talking a lot about, \u2018back in my day\u2019,\u201d Williams says, affecting an older voice far beyond her 34 years. \u201cI\u2019m so proud of where the game is right now. We\u2019ve been talking about this stuff for a long time. It\u2019s amazing to be living it. Women have been playing rugby since before the war. If they\u2019re still around I reckon they\u2019re super proud as well.\u201d Terita is conscious of this heritage but represents a new generation, stating her intention to \u201cstay in the moment\u201d, eager to entertain to the cacophony of a full stadium, appealing to an audience beyond the imaginations of her forebears.  She is active on Tik-Tok, dancing to hip-hop beats and goofing around with her friends. \u201cI try to get the other girls to get involved,\u201d she said, wryly. \u201cEspecially the older girls. Mostly because they hate it. I find that funny. I love getting girls who wouldn\u2019t normally do it. Because it gets them out of their comfort zone. I love bringing lots of positivity off the field. We play a free flowing style on the field so it\u2019s important we also have a lot of fun off it. I think that\u2019s part of my role.\u201d Her primary task is scoring tries. She\u2019s proved she can do that. If she can do so again her side has every chance of beating Scotland and then Wales the week after and qualifying for the quarter-finals. \u201cWe\u2019re confident,\u201d Williams says. \u201cWe know we can win big games. BB and I have done it before.\u201d"

                    "body": "It seems as if every person who encounters him has declared Garang Kuol ready to make an impact at this World Cup \u2013 now we know he agrees with them. The much-talked-about 18-year-old is in the frame for at least one cameo off the bench during Australia\u2019s group matches in Qatar. But if he was nervous about facing the likes of France, Tunisia and Denmark, you wouldn\u2019t know it. \u201cOf course,\u201d he said matter of factly when asked if he can make a difference for the Socceroos. \u201cIt\u2019s all about just having confidence in yourself and being ruthless, and having that mindset to want to create something and make an impact. \u201cIt\u2019s a very exciting experience for me. I\u2019ve been watching the Socceroos for a long time and the World Cup\u2019s the biggest stage, so that\u2019s just where I want to prove myself.\u201d  The hype about Kuol is real, and warranted. Despite having not started a single senior game for his club, Central Coast Mariners, the teenager dazzled in an Australian All Stars friendly against Barcelona in May and earned praise from manager Xavi Hernandez, who said \u201cit\u2019s incredible that he\u2019s 17 years old\u201d. Since then he has become the youngest player to receive a Socceroos call-up since Harry Kewell and will become a Newcastle United player in January, with a promise from the club\u2019s manager, Eddie Howe, to be patient in his development. In short, he is largely untested but also one of Australia\u2019s most dangerous assets. He is the second-youngest player at Qatar 2022 \u2013 he is 66 days older than Germany\u2019s Youssoufa Moukoko \u2013 and will become the youngest Socceroo to play should he get the chance. For him that\u2019s \u201cjust a label\u201d; what matters more is proving himself against reigning champions France on Tuesday night (Wednesday 6am AEDT). \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say intimidation,\u201d he said. \u201cI find it more exciting, to see what you can do against players of that calibre. \u201cI don\u2019t really pay attention to what\u2019s said around me. I\u2019m mainly just focused on what I do in the field and training and the game.  \u201cIf I\u2019m not playing well, I\u2019m not going to look at what\u2019s online. What I do on the field makes me happy or gives me motivation to keep pushing forward.\u201d Kuol\u2019s lack of conditioning for a full 90 minutes means he will likely be used sparingly by coach Graham Arnold, who has told the prodigious talent he has \u201cplenty of belief\u201d in him. But he did participate in a two-hour intra-team game during training this week at the Socceroos\u2019 Doha base, the Aspire Academy. \u201cIntensity was a killer, I\u2019m still getting used to it,\u201d he said. \u201cThe boys play quick, the ball just zips around. It\u2019s a whole lot of chasing. We\u2019re trying to mirror what France would do.\u201d \u201cSpeaking with Arnie, it\u2019s been very chill. He hasn\u2019t really said much. He just told me he has plenty of belief in me. I\u2019ve just got to keep training well and to prove myself.\u201d Kuol has support within the playing group, in particular from fellow South Sudanese refugees Awer Mabil and Thomas Deng.  Born in Egypt in 2004 after his family fled South Sudan, he moved to Australia as a baby and settled in Shepparton, Victoria, growing up with seven siblings including older brother Alou, 21, who is on the books of VfB Stuttgart and is also a Mariners product. \u201cIt\u2019s a journey we\u2019ve all been on as a family,\u201d Kuol said. \u201cThree years back my mum\u2019d driving me to Melbourne every two weeks \u2013 two hours there, two hours back. They\u2019re very happy for me. They\u2019re just telling me to do my best and make them proud. \u201cThere\u2019s people that spur me in the right direction. Obviously my coach at the Mariners, my parents, older brothers, these two next to me, they all play a part in the way I carry myself out and take everything in.\u201d Kuol, Mabil and Deng represent the changing face of Australia\u2019s national team in line with the country\u2019s multi-cultural society. \u201cWe have a motivation to try to [represent] not just the Australian community but also kids from our community especially, because sometimes it\u2019s easy to go down the wrong path,\u201d Mabil said. \u201cAs a kid, I wanted to see somebody from my community showing us the way. So that\u2019s our motivation, to try and push higher so we can show these kids the way.\u201d Those kids include Kuol. \u201cHe\u2019s been good since he\u2019s come in,\u201d Deng said. \u201cHe\u2019s just a young kid who wants to play football. He\u2019s just full of confidence and he\u2019s got a really bright future ahead of him. We\u2019re just trying to help him learn in the right way.\u201d"

Since then, BA has changed the route, so all flights to south-east Asia transit through Qatar. Since I have HIV, which is classed as a disability under UK law, I am not legally allowed to enter Qatar and so I cannot book flights to the region with BA. I therefore need a refund so that I can book with another airline. However, BA customer service took a month to inform me that it operates a no-refunds policy for eVouchers. One operative actually suggested I call the Qatar embassy to check if I\u2019d be deported if I flew into the country.KC, London If BA had listened to your predicament and cashed in your voucher, it might have retained a loyal customer for future flights and spared itself a public shaming. Instead, its robotic refusal to look beyond its small print has caused you weeks of distress. As it happens, the airline performed a U-turn last year and allowed customers who were due to fly between March and November 2020 to trade in their vouchers for a refund. Your flight had been due to depart in January 2021 and is not eligible. BA\u2019s reasoning is that it wasn\u2019t in a position to offer refunds before November 2020, whereas passengers due to fly after that had the choice of a voucher or cash. That \u201cchoice\u201d is debatable. BA, along with other airlines, amended its website to make vouchers the only online option. Customers who wanted their money back were required to queue indefinitely on a congested phone line. The airline only agreed to refund you for a service it could not provide after I took the matter up. It said: \u201cWe\u2019re in contact with our customer to apologise and resolve the issue.\u201d Email your.problems@observer.co.uk. Include an address and phone number.

                    "body": "There were mixed reactions to Qatar\u2019s World Cup opening day in the gulf state\u2019s media \u2013 with effusive praise for the opening ceremony and Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, and a somewhat more muted reception to the team\u2019s 2-0 defeat at the hands of Ecuador.\nEnglish-language daily the Peninsula enthused about the opening ceremony, writing: \u201cTo the entire world and all those in attendance, it was a promise delivered in spectacular fashion. While hosting the World Cup is often a once-in-a lifetime opportunity, given the global interest in hosting the Mondial, the world can give Qatar a thumbs up for delivering on its promises.\u201d\nThe Gulf Times singled out Qatari Ghanim al-Muftah for praise, saying he had \u201cshone\u201d at the opening ceremony. Born with Caudal regression syndrome, a disorder that impairs the development of the lower spine, Muftah is a local social media celebrity who walks on his hands, and who, in dialogue with Morgan Freeman, spoke on inclusion and diversity and quoted the Qur\u2019an.\n\nThe pro-government semi-official paper of Qatar, Al Raya, went beyond the call of duty in praising the man who drove Qatar to bid for the World Cup, the Emir. In an editorial following the Emir\u2019s speech at the opening ceremony, it wrote: \u201cWe are overwhelmed with feelings of love, gratitude and pride in our wise leadership, which always strives to raise the name of Qatar above the cloud.\u201d\nMuhammad Al-Marri in the Al-Watan wrote: \u201cThe truth shone like a sun in the middle of the day. And the dream turned into a tangible reality. Those who know Qatar, its leadership, and its people bet on its victory and won. As for those who doubted and promoted lies and spread fallacies, their loss was heavy and their end painful.\u201d\n\nAnd the verdict on the football? Also a painful loss.\nIn a press conference after the match, Qatar\u2019s Spanish coach, F\u00e9lix S\u00e1nchez, was pressed on whether modifying the formation and style of play of the team had lead to the loss. He told reporters the national team still has a lot to offer in its next match \u2013 against Senegal on Friday \u2013 and they did not appear at their true level.\nFocus for much criticism had been the goalkeeper Saad al-Sheeb, who flapped at a cross leading to Ecuador\u2019s early disallowed goal, and then conceded the penalty with which Enner Valencia opened the scoring. After the game Sheeb insisted: \u201cThere are two remaining matches in which we can make amends.\u201d\nIn its match report the Peninsular raised questions about the team\u2019s preparations, with journalist Fawad Hussain writing: \u201cQatar fans were expecting a much better show. The hosts failed to register a single shot on target in their historic match. Perhaps, Qatar succumbed to the pressure of winning on their World Cup debut in front of their home fans. Al Annabi didn\u2019t look a side said to be the best prepared team of this World Cup, with all the players being kept out of the country\u2019s top flight league to train at isolated camps offshore for more than four months.\u201d\nIn the Gulf Times, Sahan Bidappa wrote: \u201cThe manner in which they crumbled against Ecuador would have disappointed the home fans,\u201d many of whom were observed leaving long before the match had ended. The paper lamented: \u201cThis was supposed to be Qatar\u2019s easiest fixture.\u201d\nBidappa said: \u201cAs the Qatar players failed to impose themselves on the game, coach S\u00e1nchez stared at the roof of the tent-shaped architecture marvel Al Bayt Stadium, wondering what he or his players could have done differently on the night. In reality, not much,.\u201d\nHe added of the team \u201con the biggest stage of their lives, Qatar players looked frozen, clearly overawed by the historic occasion. This was a nervous and disjointed performance.\u201d"

                    "body": "Cameroon against Argentina at Italia 90. USA versus England in Belo Horizonte in 1950. Senegal taking on France in Seoul 20 years ago. Aficionados will argue about the order, but there is no doubt that Saudi Arabia\u2019s 2-1 victory over Argentina in Doha on Tuesday will go down alongside those matches as one of the greatest World Cup shocks of all time.\nSecond-half goals from Saleh al-Shehri and Salem al-Dawsari cancelled out a first-half penalty from Lionel Messi to give the Saudis a real chance of qualifying for the knockout stages in Qatar. But the facts of the game were barely the start of it, the significance of the moment extending well beyond the scope of just 90 minutes.\nIt would be remiss not to start with what it means for the Saudi team and their fans, so indelibly did both leave their mark on the 88,000 capacity Lusail Stadium. Nobody expected them to win against the two-times world champions. This is the sixth World Cup for which the Saudis have qualified, their record before this tournament: played 16, won three, lost 11.\n\nThey are perennial minnows, the butt of World Cup jokes and their pre-match press conference for this fixture was attended by a handful of journalists. One player said the questions asked by those who did turn up were used as typical dressing-room motivation. \u201cI enjoyed embarrassing some of those journalists, especially those at the press conferences,\u201d the midfielder Abdulelah al-Malki said. \u201cThey weren\u2019t very respectful to us but we gave them a response.\u201d\nNot just playing for pride, the Saudis were also playing for a huge contingent of travelling fans. Swathes of emerald green ran around the ground, behind the goal in which the Saudis scored twice and up into the rafters that reverberated with noise throughout. Numbering tens of thousands the Saudi support will be one of the largest at this World Cup; their songs and jeers and constant bouncing also recognisably the behaviour of football ultras.\n\n\u201cI would like to thank everyone who attended from Saudi Arabia\u201d, said Shehri. \u201cHopefully they went back to their hotels happy. We still need them, we still have two matches more and I hope they will support us like they did today.\u201d\n\nThe players responded to the roars of the crowd and, especially in the second half, delivered a performance of gusto, scoring two fine goals and throwing bodies at the ball to preserve their lead. It was also a tactically astute showing and when the players emerged in the tunnel afterwards there was no sign of elation. Instead the players, who all play for domestic club sides, uttered the more prosaic and familiar Premier League refrain (at least in translation from the Arabic) of being \u201chappy with the three points\u201d.\n\nIn short, this was a match that said Saudi Arabia had arrived and Wednesday has been declared a national holiday. But the timing of the team\u2019s historic achievement is perhaps not coincidental. The first World Cup in the Middle East remains beset by controversy but it is also giving Qatar the global spotlight ahead of its longtime rival. This match saw Saudi step centre stage however and, not only that, they claimed the culturally powerful title of sporting underdog. In the stands fans cheered wearing Newcastle United kits (designed in Saudi colours). In the executive boxes, the emir of Qatar briefly raised the Saudi flag. This was not a match without political significance.\nIt was also a contest played by two teams, and for Argentina it ended in defeat. For many they are one of the clear favourites to win this tournament and they will likely still qualify for the knockout stages. But this was a chastening loss, their first defeat in 37 matches, and the majority of the Argentina squad left the stadium in funereal silence. One exception was the captain and, for many, the best player to ever play the game: Messi.\n\nHe performed his media duties, speaking to clambering hordes of Argentinian media, accepting the defeat, trying not to let it gather too much added significance. This tournament has been framed as the 35-year-old\u2019s swansong, his last chance to win the one title that has eluded him in his garlanded career. He has been in sparkling form for his club side, Paris St-Germain, but in the second half here he looked jaded, unable to impose himself.\nMessi has his own place in the political backdrop against which this tournament is being played. PSG are owned by Qatar Sports Investments, a subsidiary of the country\u2019s sovereign wealth fund. The player himself, meanwhile, became this year a \u201cbrand ambassador\u201d for the tourist authority of Saudi Arabia, receiving an undisclosed but unlikely insubstantial fee. An icon across the world, he is a symbolic figure in the Gulf too. As he approached the exit of the Lusail Stadium the Guardian asked Messi whether, in his role as ambassador, he considered this a good day for Saudi Arabia. The legend did not respond."

                    "body": "Those at the forefront of women\u2019s rugby league in England have made no secret of their desire to capitalise on what the Lionesses achieved this year at the European Championship, and this match was about as good a start as they could have hoped for \u2013both on and off the field. On a cold, grey Tuesday afternoon in Leeds, the biggest crowd for a women\u2019s rugby league game in the UK watched the hosts start their campaign impressively against Brazil Amazonas, playing only their third game of rugby league.  It was not quite the crowd organisers had hoped for, however, with the initial plan to set the all\u2011time attendance for a women\u2019s rugby game of either code, which is just shy of 16,000. But if this occasion was a taste of what is to come, this will be an unforgettable tournament in more ways than one. Craig Richards\u2019s England players did their best to contribute to the occasion, too. Granted, they were always likely to run out comfortable winners but they handled the expectation well and sauntered to an opening-day victory. Amy Hardcastle and Courtney Winfield\u2011Hill both claimed hat-tricks, and the hosts scored 14 tries. But this was just as big a day for the women\u2019s game off the field as well as on it. For the first time in World Cup history, the women\u2019s tournament will hand out prize money and participation fees to those involved. Last week Leeds Rhinos announced they would be the first domestic team to financially reward their players with win bonuses. They are both significant steps towards women\u2019s rugby league in England turning professional and days, and crowds, such as this will accelerate that progress. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to create a legacy and we don\u2019t shy away from it,\u201d Richards said afterwards. \u201cThese girls are perfect for doing that; they\u2019ve done it tough in the past, and we want to inspire the next generation. But we\u2019re trying to win this tournament, not just win the odd game.\u201d  Brazil provided plenty of effort and spirit, as did their supporters which included a samba band that played non-stop all afternoon. But it was apparent from an early stage that England would dominate. But for a side that had played only two internationals before this, Brazil acquitted themselves well against one of the tournament\u2019s favourites. However, England\u2019s star-studded side was too strong. They moved 12-0 ahead when Caitlin Beevers and Winfield-Hill cut through the defence before Winfield-Hill, the Australian\u2011born former Big Bash cricketer who pledged her allegiance to England for the tournament, scored her second. By half-time England were out of sight. Grace Field burst through for the fourth try before the outstanding Hardcastle proved unstoppable as she charged over. Tara-Jane Stanley then made it 34-0 on the stroke of half-time after finishing a fine England move \u2013 and though Brazil had competed, they had been ruthlessly outplayed. The biggest cheer of the day was reserved for Brazil\u2019s first World Cup try on the hour, as Nat\u00e1lia Momberg raced away to spark joyous scenes among the Amazonas players. But by then Stanley and Hardcastle had crossed for two more England tries to make it 44-0. Momberg\u2019s try was a World Cup moment to savour, but it stirred England up a gear or two. That was emphasised when Hardcastle hit a fantastic angle to claim her hat\u2011trick, before she turned provider for Burke to finish in the corner. Winfield-Hill then claimed her third before Olivia Wood rounded off the scoring in the final seconds. But the final moment went to the Amazonas, who received a standing ovation from Headingley at full-time. The thousands of schoolchildren in attendance certainly seemed to enjoy every try, making plenty of noise. If just one of the 8,621 spectators in attendance goes into their school on Wednesday morning dreaming of being the next Hardcastle or Winfield-Hill, then this tournament\u2019s legacy has already been secured after just one game."

                    "body": "This was a very satisfying game of cricket, a mid-tournament group match in a rain-frazzled week that stayed alive for 39 of its 40 overs, played out in front of a semi\u2011packed Gabba. In the broader sweep of things England\u2019s 20-run defeat of New Zealand was another note in an excellent World Cup of deeper gears and genuine engagement. The lesson of these contests, which have felt jarringly real after the thin gruel of the year-round franchise circuit, is that the product works; that all the cricket is good, red or white ball, when it actually means something.  Certainly, this is not the World Cup of a sport that needs to turn itself inside out seeking every last drop of TV revenue. Not that this is likely to stop it happening. Victory keeps England\u2019s tournament hopes alive. They can still lose to Sri Lanka in Sydney, but they can also improve from here. Batting first there was still a sense of something a little tangled, an order forced to dance (or float if you want to be nice) around the Ben Stokes-shaped hole at its centre. Most signifiant of all, England looked more than ever like a team in the image of its new-ish captain. They won this game by bowling the way Jos Buttler bats: with clarity, cold-eyed execution and plans that always seemed to be two frames ahead. Win or lose from here, this was Josball in action. Key to victory were England\u2019s seamers, who significantly out-bowled their counterparts. Both teams fielded a left-armer, a right\u2011arm swinger and a genuine quick. Trent Boult, Tim Southee and Lockie Ferguson took three for 128 from 12 overs. Mark Wood, Chris Woakes and Sam Curran took five for 84 off 11. They were aided by fine, decisive captaincy from Buttler. The rotation was slick, the match\u2011ups acute without being dogmatic. Mainly they just bowled well. Wood\u2019s figures look unexceptional, but it was his final over, the 15th, that dead-headed New Zealand\u2019s chase. Basically he just bowled really fast, back of a length, drawing swishes from New Zealand\u2019s hitters when a little more in the way of batting was required.  Woakes piled into the breach. And in the end England won in a way that felt different to the Morgan\u2011Bayliss age of speed-metal batting aggression, winning instead through clarity of bowling roles and the constant nudges of the keeper\u2011captain. It is notable that the batting looks less laser-cut these days. England\u2019s total was based around an excellent opening partnership. But the Stokes conundrum still lurks at the heart of this thing. Here is a player England are picking on expected runs, on optics, celebrity pull and manly feelings of respect; but who is basically not very good at batting in T20 cricket. There are two ways of looking at this from here. Stokes did nothing in Brisbane, thrashing his way to eight to make it 67 runs in his past 10 innings. But he\u2019s too talented to do nothing for ever. Yes, numbers and data. But cricket lore, man-vibes, the ex\u2011pro gut all say he\u2019s destined to hit the winning six next week. The other approach is to apply facts not feelings. \u201cIf it comes to the crunch you want a man like Ben Stokes walking out,\u201d Paul Collingwood has suggested, but this is just incorrect on the facts, a kind of jobs-for-the-boys fantasy play. Stokes has never got past 47 for England in T20s. He averages 18. Plus, well, Carlos Brathwaite. Cricket hates comparisons with football, but it does invite them with its new-found tendency to fawn over star players. Here the effect of picking Stokes as a top-order player was to mess in some small way with the other parts around him. England went 19 overs of a key game before they got to use Dawid Malan, their best middle-order batsman, because of a fear of having him at the crease with Stokes, both labelled (not so much for Malan) as slow-starting left-handers. Moeen Ali moved to No 3 to take it to spinners, but also not to be like Stokes. Liam Livingstone was at four for much the same reason. Both swiped in a slightly forced way. Harry Brook hit a six and hurried off. Out came Stokes, who must bat whatever happens, a bit like having the coach\u2019s son in the team. He whumped the ball at the fielders, then ran out Buttler.  England ended on 179, perhaps 10 runs short of where they might have been. This is to take the negatives, to demand batting perfection. But these games are often decided by very fine margins. On the plus side Buttler was all familiar whip-crack power, and Alex Hales was more like Alex Hales, at his best when he simply stands there and unleashes the scythe. Hales got to fifty then ran past one from Mitchell Santner, who looks like he should be playing for the third XI, a break from his day job as a bookish local vet, but is also a highly effective cricketer. Buttler\u2019s batting and captaincy will surely define England\u2019s fortunes from here. Dropping Stokes to seven for the rest of the tournament would be a decisive call. For now there is at least a sense of something new; if not a triumph of Josball, then at least a sense of what it might look like."

                    "body": "\u201cBy failing to prepare, you are preparing to fail,\u201d Benjamin Franklin once said. The sentiment may be squarely in the minds of the Jillaroos when they take to the field at York Community Stadium on Wednesday (Thursday morning AEDT) to kick off their Women\u2019s Rugby League World Cup campaign. Australia go into this tournament somewhat surprisingly with no warm-up games under their belt, and without having played a Test match in three years because of Covid-19. This is a green and gold squad full of inexperience, with 12 debutants and just five players remaining from their victorious 2017 World Cup-winning side.  Tournament opponents Papua New Guinea, Canada, Brazil, France and the Cook Islands have all prepared with practice matches on UK soil in the past week, with the Moana defeating England Knights 26-14 in Leeds, while the Jillaroos have been bunkered down in a brutal fitness camp in the Gold Coast. Described as \u201cas one of the hardest sessions any of us have done\u201d by forward Kennedy Cherrington, the Australians have focused inward as the rest of the world guns for them. Winners of the last two World Cups, with New Zealand taking out the three before that, the sixth staging of the tournament is being billed as the tightest yet. Expanded from six countries to eight, the Jillaroos and the Kiwi Ferns are still expected to again battle it out at the top. Australia will be confident of their chances, on the back of the growth and expansion of the NRLW competition and their enviable depth of talent. While Test matches might have been sparse since 2019, increasing standards in the NRLW and the rise of the women\u2019s State of Origin series has placed Australia in good stead. Powerful second-rower Kezie Apps, classy fullback Sammy Bremmer and veteran playmaker Ali Brigginshaw remain from the team that knocked New Zealand off in the World Cup final in Brisbane five years ago. That trio have been named co-captains for the 2022 tournament and are joined by centre Isabelle Kelly and Simaima Taufa from the 2017 side. It is a 24-player squad dominated by the Brisbane Broncos, St George Illawarra Dragons and Sydney Roosters, with the Broncos and Dragons contributing six players each and the Chooks five. The Newcastle Knights, who won this year\u2019s NRLW grand final, have just two players in the squad in forwards Yasmin Clydsdale and Caitlan Johnston, the same as their grand final opponents\u2019 Parramatta, after prop Millie Boyle and fullback Tamika Upton both pulled out. The likes of Ruan Sims, Renae Kunst and Nakia Davis-Welsh may be long gone from the international scene but the Jillaroos still have plenty of star power to rely on. There is speed out wide in Julia Robinson and Jessica Sergis, and size up front in Shannon Mato and Shaylee Bent. Considering the increased professionalism and financial rewards Australia can draw on, compared to the other countries, complacency is perhaps their biggest issue heading into the World Cup. No other nation is blessed with the same advantages or funding resources, with the Jillaroos to receive a payment of $30,000 for this tournament compared to the $3,000 they were paid in 2017. It is something coach Brad Donald, who was appointed in 2016 and has yet to lose a game since he took over, is well aware of. \u201cComplacency is going to be a great threat to the team and we\u2019ve spoken a lot about that over the last week and a half,\u201d he said. \u201cThis World Cup, compared to the last World Cup, will be miles ahead in terms of competition. There\u2019s a number of emerging young players across all of the nations which is exciting.\u201d Donald has tried to counter that through his intense warm-up camp and with a rotation policy for the group stages. With Australia playing five games in just 17 days if they qualify for the final, and with World Cup matches to be 80 minutes long instead of the 70 minutes in the NRL, it will be a hard slog. \u201cWe need all 24 players to play for the team to be successful with such a short turnaround,\u201d Donald said. \u201cWe\u2019ll see all of our players play in the first two games so I\u2019ve tried to pick two reasonably similar squads. We have a saying that pressure equals diamonds, and all of our players are competing for a spot in the third game against New Zealand, which I\u2019d suggest is the hardest game in our pool rounds and will hopefully set us up for a semi-final.\u201d The Jillaroos start with Cook Islands, then meet France on 6 November and arch rivals New Zealand on 10 November. Depending on if they top Group B or not, they are likely to face either hosts England or Papua New Guinea in the semi-finals. A date in the final on 19 November at Old Trafford may await them. But for Donald\u2019s charges, the time has come to embrace being high-profile targets in their pursuit of more silverware."

                    "body": "Papua New Guinea have certainly given England some food for thought. The nature of the hosts\u2019 performances so far in the Rugby League World Cup meant that no matter what the Kumuls did here on a wet night in Doncaster, England were guaranteed to start Saturday\u2019s quarter-final as favourites. But Stanley Tepend\u2019s side will have left an impression on any England supporter watching here. The talk pre-match was whether Wales could pull off an almighty shock and win by 22 points or more to usurp Papua New Guinea to the eighth and final quarter-final berth. That prospect was dispelled after only 25 minutes in emphatic fashion.  By that stage, Papua New Guinea had moved into an impressive 18-0 lead. Kyle Laybutt opened the scoring with a fine solo try, before Nixon Putt and Jimmy Ngutlik added further tries. In miserable conditions, that felt like a lead that would be too big for the Welsh to bridge, let alone without considering the required number of points they needed to score to qualify from Group D. A Welsh squad almost entirely comprised of part-time players have shown plenty of spirit in a difficult group. That bodes well for the future but any flickering hopes of qualifying for the last eight were eroded long before half-time. \u201cThis is a good group, they\u2019ve improved over the past month so we\u2019ll get ready to rock and roll for the next World Cup in 2025,\u201d John Kear, the Wales coach, said. You do wonder what Shaun Wane and his England players would have made of this professional display from Papua New Guinea. They have some eye-catching stars, including the NRL superstar Alex Johnston, and are bound to cause the hosts problems at the weekend. Leading 24-0 at half time after Daniel Russell\u2019s try, the Kumuls could perhaps afford to take their foot off the accelerator in the second half. But their defensive resilience to keep Wales to nil was another impressive characteristic of their display. They extended their lead further shortly after the restart when Putt claimed his second, before Ngutlik did the same in the final minutes, with the result long since decided. Can Papua New Guinea stun the world and beat the hosts on Saturday? Their coach thinks so. \u201cThis squad is special,\u201d Tepend said. \u201cEngland are a really good team and it\u2019ll be a big test, but we\u2019ll rest up. I think we do [have a chance]. The players will be ready.\u201d"

Thanks all for your company and comments \u2013 ta-ra!      4.56pm    We\u2019re getting to the end of this blog now, so let\u2019s throw it forward to the semis. I\u2019d not be shocked to see Croatia pilfer a goal against Argentina, or schlep them to penalties, but I think France will have too much for Morocco because Varane and Upamecano will make it very difficult for Morocco to score. Obviously France v Argentina looks the likely final and that\u2019d be jam-packed with narrative: the holders looking to retain their title v Messi looked to cap his career. But picking winners in this competition feels like a fool\u2019s errand.      4.46pm    Absolutely tremendous \u201cyou know\u201ding here from Luke Shaw. The subtitles are such a great wrinkle.       4.41pm    Back to the WSL, Villa lead third-placed Arsenal 1-0 after 27 minutes; leaders Chelsea then take on Reading in the late game.      4.37pm    \u201cHmm,\u201d begins Scott Blair. \u201cI couldn\u2019t watch the game live as it turned out, but saw the highlights such as they were. Foden hardly got a mention. And when I caught up with the full match, it didn\u2019t seem to be all that different. Everyone (everyone) was raving about him beforehand \u2013 and he\u2019s a fine player \u2013 but was it an off night? Or is he not quite what folk think he is?\u201d The first time I saw Foden it was playing for an age-group side, and I immediately messaged the lads I go Man United with, saying \u201cproblem\u201d. I\u2019ve not seen anything to change my mind since then, much as I wish I had \u2013 he\u2019s a brilliant player and will get even better. His contribution last night, I think, was in his positioning, which helped England get the squeeze on France \u2013 though I\u2019d have taken him off after an hour to try Rashford, who is a brilliant sub and has the ability to make things happen.      4.29pm    \u201cAs a proud Hoosier,\u201d returns Joe Pearson, \u201cI don\u2019t have much of an opinion on Southgate, although I do think Berhalter should get the axe. \u201cOh, and on your recommendation, I have started reading The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle. Does Murakami always write about cats?\u201d This is great news, enjoy! Cats, and also ears.       4.22pm    I agree with David Hytner here too \u2013 and might add that most players pass through an entire career without making an error so cataclysmic. You\u2019ve got to credit Kane for putting himself in harm\u2019s way, but he\u2019ll know better than any of us, he let the situation get to him. If you look at his body-position as he takes the penalty, he\u2019s almost crouching, rather than standing tall, and the head going up and back is a classic sign of nerves. Just ask Michael Platini about his penalty in the 1986 France v Brazil quarter-final shoot-out, or Roberto Baggio and Franco Baresi about the 1994 World Cup final \u2013 players far greater than Kane who buckled under the pressure.       4.13pm    I\u2019ve criticised Southgate a fair bit over the last few years \u2013 he made big errors against Croatia in 2018 and more generally in 2021, when he was, I think, unduly cautious. But Jacob is spot-on here, I think, because he\u2019s made big strides these last few weeks.    Updated at 4.13pm GMT    4.05pm    \u201cThe question here is how do England get better?\u201d asks Shaun Lawson. \u201cThat was the unluckiest defeat I\u2019ve ever seen us experience at a major tournament, and I go back as far as Euro 88. But the thing is: we\u2019ve still not quite resolved the back four/back three debate (it didn\u2019t work in the first half - we were way too deep for the first half-hour or so), the central defence isn\u2019t *quite* good enough, we\u2019re maybe one central midfielder short against the very best, and up front? We are wasting Phil Foden. Completely wasting him.  When you think about it, none of the semi-finalists seem to have any doubts over their tactical setups. We still do, even though we\u2019re clearly improving. And I agree with you fully about the lack of chances created. I think Southgate should\u2019ve brought Rashford on earlier; but the conundrum for me is Foden. He\u2019s exactly the kind of player who, utilised correctly, turns very good sides into tournament-winning ones. But he\u2019s so peripheral so often. I love Southgate to bits and want him to stay - but I\u2019m not sure he knows how to get the best out of players like him? See also, Maddison, whose treatment throughout the tournament was plain weird, and really the only thing I\u2019d really criticise Gareth for. Why he wasn\u2019t brought on against Wales and/or Senegal, I can\u2019t fathom. Historically, England have wasted so many terrific creative players \u2013 Hoddle, Barnes and Scholes spring to mind. The Foden dilemma is heading in the same direction. There must be a way of prioritising both him and Bellingham; not just the latter, surely?\u201d On Maddison, he went because squad-sized was increased from 24 to 26; Southgate had been clear he preferred the former. As for Foden, I thought he was instrumental in England\u2019s improved second-half display, pressing and helping them to win the ball high up the park. I can\u2019t say I\u2019ve always trusted Southgate to get the most of his attackers because he\u2019s never managed a side with riches of this ilk. I do, though, think he\u2019s improving, even if yesterday, I didn\u2019t think his side attacked as cohesively as they should\u2019ve done \u2013 they struggled to create chances and did, I think, often have too few men attacking the box when the ball came into it. Perhaps they need to find an attacking coach with particular expertise in that area.      3.56pm    \u201cThe first rule in football is not to concede,\u201d reckons Krishna Moorthy, \u201cand Morocco are the only team that seems to have understood this. I really want them to win not out of any romantic reasons but for purely football reasons.\u201d  I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s necessarily the first rule \u2013 it\u2019s possible to outscore the opposition \u2013 but I agree that Morocco have defended superbly, with just one (own) goal conceded against Canada. Or, put another way, they\u2019ve shut out Croatia, Belgium, Spain and Portugal, which is a seriously phenomenal performance.      3.50pm    I daresay there\u2019s disappointment in Brazil too.I fancied them both for this competition and 2018 because they looked to me like the most settled side. In 2018, they ran into a near-perfect performance from Belgium\u2019s golden generation, but they\u2019ve no excuses for losing to Croatia.       3.45pm    \u201cI am 46 and I have never, ever seen any other English team play half as good as this England did,\u201d emails Luciano from Brazil. \u201cTo be honest with you guys, England always looked like a bad joke to me in all the previous World Cups I had the chance to watch. I was never able to understand how on earth you guys could hail players like Lampard, Terry, etc, let alone call them a \u201cgolden generation\u201d. BUT this team, oh man, this is a completely different story. These guys can play, they can attack, they like doing it, they are born to it, it is actually great to watch. They could have won yesterday and they kinda deserved to if you ask me. Your coach seems to be OK, much better than all those expensive fools like Capello that you used to hire in the past. Hopefully he can keep it up. I was rooting for England yesterday and I will keep doing so at Euro 2024. I think you guys are centimetres away from having a great time watching Jude, Foden and Saka becoming champions for England.\u201d If this England side had any two of the Golden Generation\u2019s centre-backs \u2013 Terry, Ferdinand, King, Campbell \u2013 or Carragher \u2013 there\u2019s a strong chance they\u2019d have beaten France, and Lampard instead of Henderson would also have given them a better shot. But oI agree, they\u2019re getting there.      3.41pm    \u201cThat cat adoption story may seem like a nice fuzzy happy little footnote,\u201d says Robert Heath, \u201cbut the reality is that it shines a little light on yet another very unsavoury aspect of Qatar. I lived there for three years and as an animal lover I was appalled at the number of abandoned animals everywhere around Doha. These are mostly cats and dogs, and very often the magnificent Saluki breed of hunting dog. It is not just the rights of \u2018lesser\u2019 humans (as they see it) that many Qataris have no respect for. Salukis are bred to work during their hunting trips in the desert (very often involving shooting or capturing endangered falcons), and if they don\u2019t come up to scratch they are unceremoniously dumped.\u201d      3.37pm    \u201cOn the discussion regarding France\u2019s first goal, which is likely to last for three and a bit years/the duration of Pickford\u2019s career,\u201d begins Neil Mackie. \u201cBeing unsighted is fine and understandable but his footwork led to him not being able to explode to his right and get to the shot, well-placed and as quick as it was. You can see Pickford\u2019s right foot makes a couple of movements, both of which seem to bring it closer to his left foot rather than going out to the right and widening his base. This then leads to him being imbalanced and unable to push off and out from that lead leg. I\u2019m part of the goalkeeper\u2019s union and so I\u2019m unsurprised that many people miss this (TV punditry and commentary regarding keeping is woeful) so that leads on to the \u2018hur hur small arms\u2019 takes on several internet disgraces. Just my tuppence worth on that.\u201d Yeah, I wondered about this at the time; just a step to his right when it looks like the ball\u2019s going in that direction, and I think he collapses the leg and saves it.      3.35pm    \u201cGreat\u201d is strong, I\u2019d say, but I agree with the sentiment that progress has been made.       3.30pm    I enjoyed this.       3.28pm         3.24pm    But is it just me who calls him Tony Rocky Horror?       3.23pm    Griezmann has had a good tournament so far, it\u2019s true.       3.19pm    \u201cI have to say I don\u2019t agree with you at all regarding the vilification of some members of the Argentina team,\u201d says Joe Sampson. \u201cFor your first reaction to a moment of pure joy to be to revel in the desolation of your vanquished opponent shows a real lack of humanity. I found it really unpleasant, to be honest.\u201d There\u2019s no humanity in schadenfreude? I couldn\u2019t agree less. But also, had the Holland players acted with dignity and class through the shoot-out, fair enough, but they didn\u2019t, and I\u2019m not remotely surprised that when Argentina went through, they reminded their opponents of their behaviour through the previous 10 minutes. While they were perpetrating it, the Netherlands will have known how things would go were they to lose, they just took the chance that they wouldn\u2019t.  Updated at 3.22pm GMT    3.13pm    And here\u2019s Suzy Wrack\u2019s match report.       3.11pm    Honours even in the WSL Manchester derby\u2026      3.09pm    Hi again and thanks Michael.      3.05pm    Going to hand back to Daniel Harris now. Enjoy the rest of your day.      3.02pm    HE\u2019S COMING HOME, etc.       2.56pm    The Golden Boot is looking like a straight shootout between Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 (5), Olivier Giroud (4) and Lionel Messi (4). There are no other players left in the tournament that have more than two goals, so seems very unlikely that the winner will not be someone in that trio. For a deep dive on this subject, check our very snazzy interactive.       2.43pm    \u201cI know it\u2019s not over yet, but how do you think this World Cup might influence club football? I\u2019ve not noticed any significant new tactical ideas, though perhaps we might see a bit more imagination on free kicks after what was possibly to moment of the tournament by the Dutch. Other than that, I wonder if it will embolden referees to add a more realistic amount of time for stoppages in regular games.\u201d I think the last point is a good one. Ten minutes of stoppage time has not been unusual in this World Cup, so it would be now odd to return to the Premier League and see just a couple of minutes added on for the Boxing Day fixtures back here in the UK. Not many can complain about more time being added and if it\u2019s good enough for the World Cup, it\u2019s good enough for Brentford v Tottenham.  In terms of tactical ideas, it\u2019s not a new one but I think we can all agree that the Dutch proved that Total Football is dead. Long live Route One. Get it launched!      2.30pm    Thought Henderson really grew into the game against France. Gave the ball away cheaply a few times in the first half but gave France a real problem with his positioning, often moonlighting as a second right winger. It meant Walker could stay back and keep Mbapp\u00e9 quiet, and gave support/options to Saka, helping him to be England\u2019s best player on the night. Southgate deserves as much credit as Henderson for that tactical tweak, in my book. And this is not exactly a surprise, but Henderson\u2019s stamina was relentless. Geezer was tearing about like a madman before he was hooked in the closing stages.  There was also this moment, in the tunnel before kick-off, which presumably means Mbapp\u00e9 is definitely not going to Liverpool now.   No doubt it had Gary Neville purring in the studio. We all remember his moment.       2.11pm    Hello everyone. How are we feeling? The canteen at Guardian HQ is serving Christmas dinners today. Multiple pigs in blankets are making me feel: a) more philosophical about England\u2019s defeat b) full     2.03pm    Righto, I\u2019m away for a breather; here\u2019s Michael Butler to coax youse through the next hour.  Updated at 2.05pm GMT    2.00pm    \u201cSouthgate might be a lovely bloke with great man-management skills but it takes more than that to win a World Cup,\u201d says Oliver Forrest. \u201cI don\u2019t recall many players talking up Deschamps\u2019 personal skills but he knows how to make the right calls to win tournaments. Southgate inexplicably substituted our best player (Saka) for one of our most out of form players (Sterling), took off our best midfielder (Henderson) and gave France the initiative by sitting deep throughout the first half. We did play well in some ways but we should do, on paper we\u2019re a top side and a quarter-final is the minimum these players should achieve. To go from a good team to a cup-winning team, the margins are very fine, and unfortunately the difference last night was the manager.\u201d I can\u2019t agree with that; the difference was Kane banging a penalty over the bar. I\u2019m also dubious that Deschamps compares favourably to Southgate \u2013 his team are good in spite of him, and with the talent they have and have had, they should be much better than they are.  Updated at 3.20pm GMT    1.58pm    I cannot get enough of this. There aren\u2019t many good things to be said for a Qatar World Cup, but I daresay the ease of travel for the Moroccan players\u2019 mums is one of them.      1.53pm    Terrible news from Qatar came overnight on Friday/Saturday.      1.50pm    Back at the Etihad, Laura Coombs has equalised for City in the Manchester derby. United had looked in control, but with just under an hour gone, there\u2019s scope for pretty much anything to happen in the time that\u2019s left.       1.48pm    I wonder how the England players will be when the domestic games get under way again. Luke Shaw and Harry Maguire in particular seemed to have trouble readjusting after the Euros, and what I hear coming out of the squad is they really, really believed they were going to do something special. Normally, they get to go on holiday and assimilate the disappointment into their psyches, but this time they\u2019re coming back to an English winter to go again immediately \u2013 the League Cup quarters get going a week Tuesday. At least the German players have had a couple of weeks to accept their failure.      1.43pm    \u201cYou could say it was a Maguire error for their goal,\u201d says Francis Mead, \u201cbut I think this was a case of a superb cross that was extremely hard to defend against. I haven\u2019t watched it again, but I think there was a bit more misfortune with it since I think it deflected off Maguire in a different direction \u2013 it might have been saved without him \u2013but that\u2019s a distraction. The game was clearly partly lost since Kane missed the penalty. I think also you are far too harsh on Pickford for the first goal \u2013 he couldn\u2019t dive earlier as the ball came through Bellingham\u2019s legs \u2013 and it was a slightly freakish long-shot that was unsaveable. It was an even game in which England had a slight superiority in chances, but France had Griezemann who provided the key cross. We are a different England team, much better than almost any team we\u2019ve had before \u2013 you can\u2019t legislate for a loss on very fine margins in a knockout tournament. If the World Cup was a league played every year, I\u2019d give us a chance of winning that league \u2013 alas it\u2019s not. I agree, it was a good cross, but this was the last eight of the World Cup so excellent crosses are expected; it remains Maguire\u2019s job to track his man and he didn\u2019t. On Pickford, I felt he should\u2019ve gambled because we could see where the ball was going, and it flicks Bellingham and goes somewhere else, fair enough. But I agree it was a very fine hit.      1.39pm    Oh, Harry. I can\u2019t say I agree that a late penalty smashed over the bar constitutes a \u201csmall detail,\u201d but he seems like a very sound citizen and though England aren\u2019t my team, I\u2019d enjoy him finding redemption because I fear this is one he\u2019ll never quite get over unless he does.       1.35pm    \u201cSome of the comments I\u2019ve read are crazy,\u201d says Finlay Fletcher. \u201cWhat more realistically could we have done last night? Saka had a half-chance, Kane misses a crucial penalty. We went toe-to-toe with the world champions and their experience and management of the key moments was the difference. Some people seem to forget that there is another team trying to win as well, who happens to posses some of the best players around.\u201d Southgate was clear pre-match that prior to the France game, England knew that if they played well, they\u2019d win, but also knew they could play well against France and still lose. This tournament felt like a big step forward from the Euros \u201cfor me\u201d and what has to happen next is that England need to find a way of translating territorial control into chances created.      1.28pm    \u201cSometimes it\u2019s pretty difficult to understand the European moral double-standard,\u201d reckons Axel Gonzalez Bruenner. \u201cIf Netherlands\u2019 players are bringing [redacted]housery it\u2019s because they\u2019re a confident and smart team. If Argentina\u2019s players do some of that then they\u2019re a bunch of classless, idiotic, and whatever-you-want-to-say guys. Let\u2019s remember that the Copa Am\u00e9rica final between Brazil and Argentina was played at the Maracan\u00e1 stadium, and nothing happened there, everybody started giving hugs to each other at the end. So, what\u2019s the narrative behind all these awful things you read out there about the Argentinian team? Are the Dutch free of guilt about being the instigators?\u201d I\u2019ve not read that stuff, though I\u2019d not be surprised if it existed. For mine, I enjoy any needle brought by any team, and the Dutch wrote cheques their penalties couldn\u2019t cash.      1.25pm    Here\u2019s today\u2019s World Cup briefing.       1.20pm    \u201cEngland should include players who are comfortable on the ball, such as Grealish,\u201d says Stefan Grima. \u201cIt\u2019s a more \u2018continental\u2019 style of football, allowing them more possession.\u201d I don\u2019t think possession was England\u2019s problem, and I\u2019m not sure who Grealish plays instead of. England are at their best when playing quickly, and he slows things down \u2013 plus Pep Guardiola tends not to pick him for the biggest games, and I\u2019d pay close attention to what he thinks.      1.15pm    \u201cI think Southgate and Santos made the exact same mistake in their quarter-finals yesterday,\u201d says K\u00e1ri Tulinius. \u201cBoth decided to go with the team that did so well in the round of 16, Southgate not changing a single player, and Santos taking Carvalho out for Neves. But France and Morocco offered very different problems to Senegal and Switzerland. Southgate bet that his forwards could outscore Deschamps\u2019, but that seemed a bet he was likely to lose. And Ronaldo was much better suited to leading the line against Morocco than Ramos. That said, if Kane scores that second penalty, and Fernandes\u2019 Van Basten impression comes off, it might\u2019ve been a different story. Fine margins, and all that.\u201d Well yes \u2013I thought Southgate was in good shape to pick what he thought was his best team and take France on \u2013 and the evidence showed he was right, the execution was just off at crucial moments. Ronaldo just isn\u2019t good anymore, so leaving him out made perfect sense to me; \u2018m not sure if he starts, we see a different game because his finishing is now unreliable.      1.09pm    On which point, is Varane the dishiest centre-back ever to be that good in the air? How on earth does he even manage it?      1.08pm    \u201cThe key thing for me for last night was that England, without playing outstandingly, at least matched the best team in the World,\u201d writes Victor Rushden. \u201cIn previous World Cups (such as the 1990 SF), in such games you felt England needed to play outstandingly, the opposition have an off-day, and England would need a bit of fortune to win. As England are getting better, it feels a matter of time.\u201d Part of me wonders if this was their biggest chance, just because by the next World Cup they might need to have found a new centre-forward \u2013 though I guess Kane never had much gas so perhaps he won\u2019t drop off. They could, though use a better pair of centre-backs than the two they\u2019ve got, and I\u2019m not sure I see any obvious candidates coming through. Ultimately, France\u2019s winner came because Maguire made an error while, at the other end, Upamecano and Varane didn\u2019t make that kind of error.  Updated at 1.18pm GMT    1.00pm    Leah Galton has put United ahead at City in the WSL Manchester derby \u2013 and it\u2019s a really nice goal too.      12.58pm         12.52pm    \u201cThank you for the World Cup coverage, you\u2019re all doing fantastic work at the Guardian!\u201d says Santiago. \u201cI just wanted to point out, since the Argentinian team has been vilified to no end for their less-than-gracious celebration after defeating Netherlands, to this bird\u2019s eye view of Lautaro Martinez\u2019s penalty. As you\u2019ll see, as Lautaro walks towards the penalty spot, four Dutch players surround him and leave the designated area (rule 3 of penalty shoot-outs determines all players except goalies and kicker must stay in the centre circle), presumably to intimidate him \u2013 and apparently that was the case throughout the shoot out. Of course, this doesn\u2019t necessarily justify the behaviour of the Argentinian players (when they go low we go high, etc.), but might help understand it \u2013 especially after such a tense game, which included what might be the worst refereeing in this tournament, between two teams who\u2019ve always enjoyed provoking each other (Van der Saar insulting Ortega\u2019s mum and Ortega headbutting him in \u201898 comes to mind).\u201d   No vilification here. That entire farrago was an absolute joy; as Ricky Hatton used to say of boxing, it\u2019s not a tickling contest, and the more needle and edge, the better. Netherlands did what they did to try and get an advantage, didn\u2019t, and I\u2019d be staggered if they thought Argentinas retaliation at the moment of victory was not one they\u2019d more than earned.      12.48pm    \u201cIt pains me as a Welshman to say this,\u201d emails Huw Swanborough, \u201cbut I think it\u2019s beyond unfair to say that England underperformed or were outclassed last night. I do think the defending wasn\u2019t good enough on Giroud\u2019s goal, but Tchoumeni\u2019s was just one of those goals that you can\u2019t keep out.nEngland created the same quality and quantity of non-penalty chances I think, and played well overall, particularly limiting Mbapp\u00e9 and restricting the French game to counter-attacks even before they took the lead. Non-penalty finishing could have been better, but Lloris also made some good stops, and there were 2-4 occasions where the ball was bouncing without any control between players in the French box that would have been tap-ins on another day. You make your own luck, sure \u2026 but even without Kane\u2019s penalty miss, it was a fine margins defeat.\u201d I\u2019m still not sure about the Tchouameni goal. It was a tremendous hit, sure, but it felt like it was obvious where it was going to go even as he was hitting it, but Pickford didn\u2019t dive until the ball was past the last line of defenders. Had he backed himself and gone early, I think he\u2019d have saved it.      12.43pm    \u201cI just wanted to react about the Argentina v Netherlands game,\u201d says Alexandre. \u201cI think it will be remembered as a classic. I agree that for 80 minutes it was not great, with Argentina totally in control and the Netherlands utterly clueless and impotent in attack. But these last 20 (with the added time) minutes were too great, and the extra time was also decent enough (where\u2019s the \u2018extra time is useless\u2019 crowd after these QFs?), before a great penalty shootout. With time we\u2019ll forget the not great parts and focus on this drama. So it\u2019ll be a classic. Also wanted to quickly weigh in about Southgate. As a Frenchman I was extremely surprised by how good England was last night. I didn\u2019t expect them to be this good. Sure, Southgate has his limitations (taking off Saka? Underusing the bench which was an area where England had a clear edge over France?). But I think what he brings to England in terms of building a team is underrated. To have a better coach you need to find an equally good team builder who\u2019s also great tactically and using his bench - in other words the perfect coach. Good luck with that. Think Southgate will learn and wouldn\u2019t be surprised at all if England were to win the next Euros taking place - guess where ? - in Germany.\u201d Southgate\u2019s role in fostering a compelling, contagious atmosphere should not be underestimated. The players love playing for him and hanging out as a group, and the atmosphere isn\u2019t confined to the squad but has, to an extent, permeated through the country. I didn\u2019t mind him waiting to make changes because England were on top, but as I said below, Sterling for Saka made little sense to me \u2013 though I doubt it was decisive.  Updated at 12.43pm GMT    12.37pm    More live football for you, and it\u2019s a biggie!      12.35pm    ITV have sent out last night\u2019s viewing figures:  England v France watched by 23 million on ITV Biggest audience of 2022 saw England World Cup Quarter-final showdown with France England\u2019s World Cup Quarter Final match was watched by a peak audience of 23 million across ITV and ITVX last night as the Three Lions were narrowly defeated by France. The game drew the biggest audience of the tournament and the highest peak on any channel this year (biggest since the final of last year\u2019s European Championship between England and Italy). It was the most watched programme on television on any channel this year for all viewers (15.1m) and 16-34s (2.5m) ITV had its best Saturday night on record ( ecords go back to 2002). Across all viewing on all devices, an average audience of 20.4 million viewers watched the match - with an average of close to 16 million viewers [15.8m] watching the full live and exclusive coverage. Last night\u2019s England v France match was streamed 15.3m times and Morocco\u2019s win over Portugal, shown live on ITV earlier on Saturday, was streamed 8.2m times. In total there were 30m streams on ITVX yesterday, which is the best ever for the Hub or ITVX.\u201d   Updated at 12.35pm GMT    12.34pm    On the subject of Neves, though, I\u2019ve not a clue why Fernando Santos, right when he\u2019d hit on a formula that worked, brought the Wolves man back into the team when Otavio and William Carvalho looked a decent combination.      12.31pm    A few things I loved at full-time of Morocco v Portugal: Hakim Ziyech just laughing hysterically, unable to believe what was happening; R\u00faben Neves and Roman Sa\u00efss enjoying a hug; and Zakaria Aboukhlal\u2019s teammates whacking him on the head after he missed a one-on-one to finish the game in the tamest fashion imaginable.      12.28pm    I don\u2019t get this. I think Bruno is right, it probably doesn\u2019t make sense to appoint an Argentinian ref for a match the winners of which might play Argentina at some point, and if anyone was going to haul Portugal back into the game, it was him. But his team lost because they played poorly, and the ref was not part of proceedings in the way he was in the Netherlands v Argentina and England v France games.   Updated at 12.45pm GMT    12.24pm         12.23pm    And as for the players celebrating with their mums, oh my days! My eyeballs are sweating watching this again.       12.22pm    We\u2019ve not mentioned Morocco v Portugal yet, so what about that one? Portugal, like England, will know they\u2019ve missed a golden opportunity here. Which is not to denigrate Morocco, not at all \u2013 in Sofyan Amrabat they might just have the player of the tournament, and they\u2019ve defended brilliantly in every game. I\u2019m also enjoying the historical revenge of them beating Spain and Portugal \u2013 with France to come \u2013 and watching them express their cultural and religious imperatives in victory is so affirming.      12.17pm    \u201cPresumably Kane practises penalties against Lloris all through the season,\u201d says Garry Smith. \u201cYou\u2019d want your best penalty taker to practise against your best keeper, and vice versa. They must both, therefore, know the other\u2019s capabilities very well, and also know the approximate chances of Kane scoring.So perhaps, having already scored one, at the second penalty Kane\u2019s mind may well have been churning with all the options, and also reminding him what his chances were of scoring another. In which case, ballooning the ball way over the bar was perhaps no great surprise?\u201d In comms, they said he\u2019d not practised many against Lloris \u2013 which sounded strange. But I guess the emphatic way he despatched the first made one think he\u2019d sort out the second too \u2013 though, if we\u2019re being real, Kane properly bottled one against Denmark in the semis of the Euros, he just got lucky that the ball came back out to him.      12.07pm    Gosh, godspeed old mate.       12.06pm     \u201cGareth has been amazing with myself,\u201d Maguire said.\u201d  I do love a bit of reflexive pronoun abuse.      12.05pm         12.03pm    \u201cI thought J Liew\u2019s article today hit the nail on the head,\u201d returns John Trolan. \u201cThose who have been there before bring a calmness and confidence to the occasion. Giroud looked rubbish for 10 minutes before he hit the winner. Out of position, couldn\u2019t keep up with the pace and I was surprised he was still on the pitch. But then one chance and he doesn\u2019t blink.\u201d I think that\u2019s a little generous. Giroud missed a great chance before he scored, the best of the half, and Tchouameni and Hernandez both gave away penalties unnecessarily. Football is a chaotic game, and last night, that worked for France, but it could just as easily not have done.     11.56am    \u201cArg v Ned was undoubtedly a dull game,\u201d says Brendan Large. \u201cIf you said this was a great game and then showed the first 82 mins to someone they\u2019d think you had lost all grip on reality. The only thing \u2018good\u2019 was the excitement at the end. Even extra time was rubbish.\u201d I referred my mate to Brazil v France from 1986 \u2013 and that was played on an unhelpful pitch in the heat of the day. You can watch the full match here and you won\u2019t regret it, I promise.       11.52am    \u201cSomehow like a poor film, you still remember the one great line years later \u2026 the Netherlands free-kick at the end\u2026\u201d says Richard Potter.  That was the goal of the tournament by miles, for mine. The daring to try it under pressure \u2013 though I guess if it doesn\u2019t come off, maybe the players can blame managment.      11.50am    I wrote a little about that here:      11.49am    \u201cEngland are like Man City in the Champions League,\u201d says Ian Macpherson. \u201cThey have the players, the manager, the resources, can put breathtaking moves together and score great goals \u2026 but when the chips are down are outwitted by more savvy teams. They gave it a great shot, but came short at crucial moments, no disgrace in that, especially as the young stars need to learn a bit more cunning I feel. Something France had in their greater experience and nous. They will come good.On the subject of Southgate, it is crazy to knee-jerk call for his dismissal. There is nobody who could take over and do better, and starting all over with a new man will just disrupt everything he has patiently built around the squad. Let us remember he has detoxified the atmosphere around playing for England, and has created a positive team culture with a raft of young talent. He has addressed the nasty undercurrent of nationalism which has bedevilled the England support for decades, and for that alone should be honoured. To throw that away in the pursuit of a quick fix which will probably set them back is short sighted in the extreme. There is no saviour waiting in the wings. People will remember this match as a classic of its kind, so close it could have gone either way, full of incident and drama. For that alone let us be thankful and enjoy it.\u201d I agree that it was the best last-eight tie by far, but disagree a little on City. They keep getting caught, as Munich under Guardiola did, because they don\u2019t have the back five to handle it when, as is almost inevitable at that level, a side with serious attackers gets it together. When he had Messi and the greatest midfield ever, he could get away with it, but not otherwise.     11.41am    \u201cGreat football matches don\u2019t always equate to great football,\u201d says John Toolan. \u201cThat match between Argentina and Netherlands had everything you want from a classic. Argentina odds on to win until \u2026 and the rest is history. You couldn\u2019t take your eyes off it \u2013 even when it was over!\u201d The needle was tremendous, I agree, but I found the game fairly disappointing until the last 10minutes. What I will say is that both that game and Brazil Croatia delivered pretty decent extra-time, which is extremely unusual.      11.39am    \u201cSouthgate did a \u2018much better job\u2019 by what metric?\u201d emails Nathaniel Byrne. \u201cGoing out sooner in the tournament? Or because they beat an Iranian team without their concussed goalkeeper, an already eliminated Wales and a Senegal team who were missing Mane and just about qualified from a group with their worst team in a World Cup in decades. The soft soap that everyone is applying to Southgate is sickening to an outsider. No critical opinion is being put into his terrible subs, the insipid play throughout the game but particularly the last 10 minutes and the cowardice his teams have always played with. Relegated in Nations league but still doing \"\u2018a much better job\u2019 than what?! Mike Bassett?!\u201d The metric of what my eyes tell me. The England team at the Euros were better than the England team in the 2018 World Cup, and the England team at this World Cup were better than the England team at the Euros. I don\u2019t really care too much about the Nations League; I criticised his subs below; but I think you can lose a World Cup quarter to the holders, narrowly, and it not mean the manager is rubbish.      11.34am    \u201cThere\u2019s a parallel universe where, Kane having scored the first penalty against his Spurs team mate, reckons the second just seems too risky to try it again, so he hands the ball to Ivan Toney\u2026\u201d There is no universe, parallel or otherwise, where a killer and team captain like Harry Kane passes on that responsibility. And Ivan Toney has never taken penalties under pressure anywhere near as intense, which is something to which we don\u2019t pay enough heed. We think what separates sportsfolk from the rest of us is talent, and it is, but what also differentiates them from us is the desire to embrace fear.      11.30am    Settle an argument: I was saying to mate yesterday that the Argentina v Netherlands game wasn\u2019t a classic, it just got a bit exciting at the end; he insisted it was a terrific game of football and a World Cup classic. Which of us is right?      11.25am    Away from England for a moment, this is incredible.      11.24am    What we need to accept, I think, is that at the top level, it\u2019s possible to play well and lose because the opposition have good players and lots of experience. That\u2019ll be hard for the players to tolerate because a semi-final against Morocco was there for the taking, while Kane and Maguire, who\u2019ll be 33 next time round, might feel this was the chance of their lifetimes.      11.19am    \u201cIt is not enough to set up a team and send them out with the mindset \u2018not lose\u2019,\u201d says Anthony Trent. \u201cWe have to be brave, we have to have the courage to dare to win.\u201d I think England did try to win last night. The issue was execution not ideology.      11.18am    \u201cSouthgate is not anywhere near good enough for the job,\u201d emails Patrick Cox. \u201cHe has flattered to deceive in every tournament he\u2019s played in thus far. Losing to Croatia in a semi-final? Four million people? Losing to Italy in a final when they can\u2019t qualify for the World Cup is subpar, to be kind about it. The qualifying and friendlies haven\u2019t been a roaring success either. It is sad to lose a great generation of talent like Roberto Martinez with Belgium being poorly managed but it seems to be a theme in international soccer. Those two victories would have set this team up for a title run this tournament but only with a good manager. This England team are fragile mentally, failure is accepted and we should have eaten France up.\u201d I don\u2019t think it matters how many people live in Croatia if among them are Modric, Kovacic, Rakitic, Mandzukic and so on. I do think Southgate\u2019s tactics were poor against Italy in the Euros final, but in this tournament he did a much better job and ultimately, his players didn\u2019t execute at the big moments. That\u2019s their fault, not his, I\u2019d say      11.12am    From PA: \u201cFootball Association chief executive Mark Bullingham has expressed his pride for Gareth Southgate and the England squad after their World Cup exit. A 2-1 defeat by France in the quarter-finals ended what had been a positive tournament for the national side. \u2018Like all England fans we feel the pain of losing a quarter-final, along with the coaches, players and support team who are hurting this morning,\u2019 he said in a statement. \u201cGareth and Steve (Holland) prepared the team exceptionally well throughout the tournament. The players were committed to winning the trophy and were very well led by Harry Kane. \u2018But sport can have fine margins and on the day, against the current world champions, it was not to be. \u2018This is a very exciting young English squad and, despite the intense disappointment of last night, they should be very proud of their performances in Qatar. \u2018We are incredibly proud of Gareth, the players, the coaches and the support team and appreciate all the hard work they put in.\u2019\u201d     11.09am    \u201cRegarding Southgate,\u201d says TS Ahmad, I think his team is mature enough to win without him. I don\u2019t know if fans want to see him in for the Euros; time must be spent efficiently and you have a fantastic squad but that are growing too so if England doesn\u2019t win it wouldn\u2019t fans think back and say: he should have gone by the end of the World Cup, he only took us to the quarter finals? (even it is hard to do it, as the sentiment is that the boys played well). Hard to see a capable manager (e.g.Eddie Howe) leave their jobs and pursue the England one.\u201d Yup, I don\u2019t see that there are loads of alternative options should Southgate turn it in.      11.06am    And here are Barney Ronay\u2019s thoughts (apologies, I\u2019ve had some connectivity issues).    Updated at 11.35am GMT    10.12am    \u201cLack of chances?\u201d says Ed Bayling. \u201cThink you\u2019re being a bit harsh there. Bellingham drew a great save from Lloris with that fiery volley, and Maguire nicked the woodwork with a back post header from about four yards. And one could argue the penalties would have been good chances, but for a timely foul...\u201d I wouldn\u2019t class Bellingham\u2019s dig as a chance created \u2013 the ball fell to him and he had a dig, but it was almost impossible to score from there given the height and pressure. Which leaves us with one header from a corner; I don\u2019t think Mount was getting near the pass prior to the penalty he won, nor do I think Saka was on the cusp of creating something but for Tcouameni\u2019s foul.      10.07am    Email! \u201cWhen a French fan was asked who they feared about England, he said, \u2018Rashford\u2019,\u201d muses Peter Gartner, \u201cRashford, given more of a chance, could be as good as Mbapp\u00e9. We might have done better if Rashford had started, instead of putting him on with about five minutes left. I don\u2019t understand Southgate under-using Rashford.\u201d I don\u2019t think Rashford could be as good as Mbapp\u00e9, but I do think he\u2019s got more talent than Sterling \u2013 Sterling has just played in better teams and for better managers and coaches. My guess on his usage by Southgate is that he\u2019s a really good sub \u2013 a better one than three other wide attackers \u2013 and I thought oden and Saka did well in the second half yesterday.   Updated at 10.07am GMT    9.56am         9.55am    One thought that\u2019s nagging at me: even when England were dominant in the game, they still failed to create any serious chances, and the best one of the second half was wasted by Giroud.      9.51am    Here are Jonathan Liew\u2019s thoughts on last night.       9.45am    Ouch dept:      9.43am    The story of last night, in photo form.       9.37am    There\u2019s live sport for our delectation going on right now, the Testvangelists at it again.      9.29am    I\u2019d be fairly surprised if Southgate goes. I think he husbanded his resources far more wisely than in the Euros, and England now have a team able to go up against yer Frances and try to dominate. Previously, they\u2019d have planned to defend deep while hoping for a counter or a moment of magic. Now, though, they\u2019ve the ability to dominate in midfield, and if Kalvin Phillips were to replace Jordan Henderson, you\u2019d have three absolute physical brutes, which some very serious technical ability. England and Southgate will know they were good enough to win this tournament, but that they\u2019ll be better two years from now.       9.22am    On which point, I\u2019ll tell you what I absolutely loved: Giroud\u2019s celebration. When France won the World Cup in 2018, he not only failed to score but didn\u2019t even record a shot on target. He won\u2019t mind too much because he did his job for the team, but it\u2019d be foolish to think that didn\u2019t bother his pride, and he\u2019s making amends this time round.      9.19am    In similar vein, I agree with Maguire that the ref was poor. But you almost never lose a game because of the officials; they make mistakes and it\u2019s up to the players to be good enough in spite of that. It wasn\u2019t the ref who, to take a random example, allowed Giroud in front of them to score the winning goal.       9.17am    I\u2019m afraid, though, that was not a game settled on \u2018small details\u201d, because wellying a late penalty over the bar is, I\u2019m afraid, a colossal happening.       9.10am    I agree with Jacob that Saka and Rice were England\u2019s best players, but I thought Bellingham looked a little leggy in the second half. On which point, Sterling for Saka was a very strange sub, I thought. It was, of course, possible that Sterling might\u2019ve scored, but it was hard to see him having as much influence on the game and the player he replaced.      9.07am    And here are Jacob Steinberg\u2019s player ratings.       9.02am    Here\u2019s David Hytner\u2019s match report from the Al Bayt Stadium.       9.00am   Preamble  Every now and again \u2013 really not often \u2013 a misfortune befalls a sportsperson that has you wincing because you know they\u2019ll be lugging it about them for the rest of their days. John Terry slipping in the 2008 Champions League final, Steven Gerrard saying this doesn\u2019t slip then slipping before Demba Ba scored for Chelsea \u2026 and poor old Harry Kane missing a penalty when England looked in with a chance of becoming world champions.  So we\u2019ll be spending today looking back at that and the rest of the quarter-finals, while looking forward to the semis and beyond. Send us in your thoughts, and we\u2019ll see where we get to.

Here is how you can watch the Socceroos in action as Australia take on Argentina in the last 16.\nWhen is the World Cup happening?\nIn a drastic departure from its usual June and July slot on the calendar, the 22nd edition of the showcase tournament kicked off on Monday 21 November. Hosts Qatar lifted the curtain against Ecuador, while Australia\u2019s national football team got their campaign up and running against defending champions France. Australia\u2019s next match of the group stage is against Denmark on Thursday morning, with a kick off time of 2am AEDT.\nSocceroos results/fixtures:\n\nFrance vs Australia \u2013 Wednesday 23 November, 6am AEDT\nTunisia vs Australia \u2013 Saturday 26 November, 9pm AEDT\nAustralia vs Denmark \u2013 Thursday 1 December, 2am AEDT\nArgentina v Australia \u2013 Sunday 4 December, 6am AEDT\n\n\nThis year\u2019s World Cup is the last to feature 32 teams before the competition expands to 48 in Canada, Mexico and the US in 2026. Those teams are divided into eight groups of four, with winners and runners-up from each to advance to the last 16. The knockout stage begins in the early hours of 4 December, the quarter-finals on 10 December and the semis on 14 December.\nThe 2022 World Cup final is scheduled to be played at 2am AEDT on Monday 19 December \u2013 which is also Qatar National Day. In total, 64 matches will be played over the course of the month-long tournament.\nHow can I watch and follow from Australia?\nThe Guardian is extensively liveblogging the tournament with live blogs for individual matches running throughout the group stage all the way until the final.\nSee our full Fifa World Cup 2022 coverage here, or go straight to our World Cup live blogs.\nOn the ground in Qatar will be a team of 15 Guardian journalists, including Socceroos correspondent Emma Kemp, all of whom will be reporting on both the football on the pitch and the myriad issues arising off it.\nFor those watching on their couches, every match can be seen live in a free-to-air exclusive broadcast on SBS, with live streams available on SBS On Demand. Eight of those live games will also be shown on SBS Viceland.\n\nWhere is it happening?\nIn another break with tradition, every ball at this World Cup will be kicked within a 55km radius in Doha, the capital of Qatar, making it the most geographically compact tournament in World Cup history. Eight stadiums will host the matches, ranging from the smallest \u2013 Stadium 974, Al Janoub Stadium and Al Thumama Stadium, which hold 40,000 \u2013 to the 80,000-capacity Lusail Stadium, which will host the final.\nWhy is it controversial?\nFrom Fifa\u2019s original decision to award hosting rights to Qatar 12 years ago to the country\u2019s record on human rights, via its treatment of migrant workers and discriminatory laws, this World Cup has attracted attention for the wrong reasons like no other before it. For many, the tournament sits uncomfortably, but it will provide an opportunity to use the spotlight on Qatar to draw attention to these issues.\n\nIs this the last major sporting event this year?\nIf you have been thinking there have been a quite a few World Cups going on of late, you would not be wrong. Between the T20 World Cup, the men\u2019s and women\u2019s Rugby League World Cups and the Women\u2019s Rugby World Cup, it\u2019s been a hectic end to the year. The tournament in Qatar is not quite the last one of the 2022 though \u2013 there\u2019s still the short course swimming championships in Melbourne and a couple of Test cricket series to come in December if you\u2019re not already completely over sport."

                    "body": "When the Rugby League World Cup kicks off next Saturday, one year later than originally planned, there will be few prouder families watching than the Youngs. Had things turned out differently and the Covid pandemic never materialised, Alex and Dom Young would have made history by joining an exclusive band of brothers who have played together at a World Cup, doing so for debutants Jamaica.  Instead, they will be writing an even more exclusive piece of rugby league history as brothers representing two separate nations. Alex, who spent 2022 playing part-time in the Championship for Workington, will honour his grandmother\u2019s heritage by appearing for the Reggae Warriors in their first World Cup. Dom, who has become a try-scoring sensation in the bright lights of Australia\u2019s NRL with Newcastle Knights, will play for England, where he and Alex were born and raised, despite recent ill-judged comments from the broadcaster Eddie Hemmings. \u201cIt was very difficult to say no to Jamaica,\u201d says the 21-year-old Dom. \u201cIf the World Cup had gone ahead last year as planned, it would have been Jamaica I\u2019d played for. And that would have meant playing with Alex for the first time. So it was tough to tell him I was going to opt for England.\u201d Dom and Alex were graduates of the Huddersfield Giants academy but their careers have taken drastically different paths. Dom, frustrated by a lack of game-time at Huddersfield, took a chance on a move to Australia. Within two years, he has become a regular at Newcastle Knights and his form this year was good enough for Shaun Wane to include him in his 24-man England squad. Alex, meanwhile, went part-time after studying law at university. \u201cI had a bit of a different focus I guess,\u201d says Alex, who is two years older than Dom. \u201cDom backed himself and took a real risk, whereas I was a bit more conservative with rugby. But it\u2019s incredible we both get to represent our backgrounds at a tournament of this size despite our different journeys.\u201d Representing Jamaica is a point of pride for Alex, not just to honour his family heritage, but also to try to leave a lasting impact with the Reggae Warriors far beyond the games they will play against New Zealand, Ireland and Lebanon in Group B. After all, this is only the second time a Jamaican team has featured at a World Cup in any sport. \u201cThe guys in this group are absolutely desperate to put Jamaica on the rugby league map,\u201d Alex says. \u201cThere\u2019s a chance to really engage with people over here of Jamaican heritage that maybe don\u2019t have too much knowledge about rugby league, and really get a buzz going back over there, too. It\u2019s already been an experience I\u2019ll carry with me for the rest of my life. \u201cWhen I told my grandma I\u2019d been selected for Jamaica I\u2019ll never forget that moment. We\u2019ve been shown clips from over there about us making the news and it\u2019s generating some hype. It\u2019s up to us now to help spread the message that Jamaica is a presence in rugby league.\u201d  Alex does share some sadness that his brother will not be lining up alongside him for the first time in their careers, but concedes he can fully understand the path Dom has taken. \u201cThere is a little bit of mixed emotion but I\u2019m so proud of him,\u201d he says. \u201cHe\u2019s not had it easy, he\u2019s been limited with his chances early in his career and now he\u2019s an England international. I can see the bigger picture, and that for him is being on the top of the world stage. He totally deserves it.\u201d How does Dom feel? \u201cAlex fully understood, but he was gutted \u2013 as was I in a way,\u201d the winger says. \u201cHe supported me in my decision and our parents did, too. They\u2019re so proud that we\u2019re both playing in a World Cup and the fact we\u2019re doing it for different nations makes it really cool. \u201cI\u2019m so proud of him representing our family heritage and I\u2019ll be going to any Jamaica games I can. But as soon as I heard England were interested it became a bit of a no-brainer for me. I just couldn\u2019t turn this opportunity down.\u201d  Dom marked his international debut on Friday with a magnificent individual display for England against Fiji. It will almost certainly be enough to secure a place in the side against Samoa in front of 50,000 supporters next Saturday in Newcastle. Those sorts of crowds are the norm for Dom, who is clearly set for a bright future in the NRL. Alex\u2019s future is less clear, however. \u201cI don\u2019t really know for sure what I\u2019m doing next year \u2013 but I would like to continue playing,\u201d he says. That makes the Jamaica opportunity even more important in potentially attracting a new contract from a part-time club. It is a world away from Dom\u2019s future, but Alex is just as proud to see his younger brother\u2019s rise to the top. \u201cAs kids we were really close and I\u2019ve got loads of memories where we would be watching England games dreaming of making it ourselves one day,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen I see him singing the anthem it\u2019s going to be an insane feeling. I\u2019ll be so proud to be his big brother.\u201d The one problem for the Young family? Where to go on 22 October when Alex will be playing for Jamaica against New Zealand in Hull while Dom will be lining up for England against France in Bolton. \u201cMy dad didn\u2019t give me an answer when I pushed him on it,\u201d Alex says. \u201cWherever they go, I\u2019m sure they\u2019ll be cheering us both on no matter what.\u201d"

                    "body": "At some point late on a wild night in Lusail, Lionel Messi was asked what had happened out there. \u201cA bit of everything,\u201d he said. There had been four goals, eight penalties, 17 yellow cards and one red. In the end, there was only one winner, even if they had to win it twice. Maybe even three times. Or, to put it another way: as the Argentina goalkeeper, Emiliano Mart\u00ednez, departed the pitch, he did it with a defiant look in a Dutch direction, shouting his expletive-rich message in English to make sure it wasn\u2019t lost. It was that kind of night and at that point it wasn\u2019t over. \u201cWe suffered more than we should have done,\u201d Messi said. \u201cAt 2-0, we had it under control, we shouldn\u2019t have had to go to extra time, let alone penalties.\u201d  The Netherlands, though, had gone to Plan B, launching long, Luuk de Jong and Wout Weghorst sent on, got one back and then scored a superb free-kick to equalise on 101 minutes. And so now here they were on the spot, as if it wasn\u2019t tense enough already. This was what the Dutch wanted, the advantage apparently theirs, but Mart\u00ednez had saved from Virgil van Dijk and Steven Berghuis. Enzo Fern\u00e1ndez shot wide at 3-2, opening up the chance of another absurd shift when Luuk de Jong made it 3-3. Lautaro Mart\u00ednez had the last shot, the opportunity to send them through, the whole thing distilled. \u201cUgly,\u201d Lionel Scaloni called it. Fifa has since opened a disciplinary case against both teams. It\u2019s a long, lonely walk from the halfway line to the penalty spot, or at least it\u2019s supposed to be, but when Lautaro Mart\u00ednez\u2019s time came he had company. Asked where his thoughts had turned as he prepared to take the penalty that could carry Argentina into the World Cup semi-final, the striker, on as a sub, said: \u201cCalmness and confidence\u201d. Yeah, good luck with that. As he set off, four Dutch players followed him, led by Denzel Dumfries, and they were still surrounding him almost halfway there.  The assistant referee stepped in, sending them back, but there were words. De Jong, who had just scored his penalty, had a word. The goalkeeper, Andries Noppert, had more of them. Mart\u00ednez, though, thumped his penalty into the net and from the halfway line, Argentina\u2019s players began to sprint his way. When they set off, and for a while after as they ran, at least four \u2013 Leandro Paredes, Gonzalo Montiel, Germ\u00e1n Pezzella, Nicol\u00e1s Otamendi \u2013 and probably more turned to the Dutch players and celebrated in their faces. Otamendi raised his hands by his ears, taunting. \u201cI celebrated in their faces because on every penalty one of their players was saying things to ours,\u201d he said. All of them raced to the left corner and Lautaro Mart\u00ednez, except for Messi who ran for Emiliano Mart\u00ednez, lying in a star shape on the grass in the other corner. \u201cHe\u2019s a beast and today he responded again; we\u2019re grateful,\u201d the captain said. Soon, Dumfries was running in the same direction, trying to get at them. He had to be held back; not just calmed down but dragged out of there. It took three men. Just another confrontation, just another celebration, and those two things kept clashing. There had been a ball booted into the Dutch bench and flying tackles. Messi accused Weghorst of coming on and provoking everyone. Mart\u00ednez was not the first penalty taker followed across the field: \u00c1ngel Di Mar\u00eda came to Fern\u00e1ndez\u2019s rescue. You wouldn\u2019t have seen it on TV but there was also a pitch invader. Like Dumfries, it needed a lot of men to get him under control. And in the middle of it the referee was \u201cMateu-Lahozing\u201d again \u2013 and yes, that is a verb, or it should be.  \u201cIt\u2019s not easy,\u201d De Jong said. \u201cBut he seemed to blow very easily for Argentina.\u201d Messi and Emiliano Mart\u00ednez thought differently. Messi suggested it was possible sanctions that silenced him, while Mart\u00ednez wasn\u2019t afraid. \u201cHe was giving everything for them. He gave 10 minutes extra for no reason. He just wanted them to score. He\u2019s useless.\u201d That was not all the goalkeeper said, adding: \u201cVan Gaal said: \u2018If we go to penalties we win.\u2019 He should keep his mouth shut.\u201d Messi said so too in his way, standing there in front of the Dutch bench cupping his ears. Edgar Davids gazed back at him through dark glasses. The day before Louis van Gaal had suggested Messi doesn\u2019t run much. \u201cHe talks about good football but just boots the ball long. I don\u2019t like people talking before the game: that\u2019s not part of football,\u201d Messi said. This was, though. \u201cThere were things out there that shouldn\u2019t happen but, well, it\u2019s a World Cup quarter-final,\u201d Messi said.  By the time the players reappeared \u2013 and it was 3am when they did \u2013 they had all come round to that view, the battle done now. Asked if Argentina had been too aggressive, Nathan Ak\u00e9 said: \u201cNo, no, it shows how much they wanted to win the game; we wanted the same. That\u2019s where the emotion comes in and the fight comes in, that\u2019s just part of it, and we understand.\u201d The Manchester City player smiled, unable to answer why Messi hadn\u2019t been booked for a clear handball and when it came to the final celebration conceded: \u201cMaybe out of emotion, you do stuff \u2013 I don\u2019t think you can be too critical.\u201d They had been at \u201c1,000 revolutions,\u201d Pezzella said. \u201cIt\u2019s a World Cup, there is a lot on the line, it is hard. Everybody wants to win: the players on the bench, the staff. And you see this,\u201d De Jong said.  If Messi had suggested these were things that shouldn\u2019t happen, for all the moralising, it did help make it more of an event. It may also have been good for Argentina, a team forged in the fight, stronger the more they suffer. They had won that way, too. Messi interrupted a post-match interview to shout: \u201cWhat you looking at, fool.\u201d People in the tunnel believe Weghorst was waiting to suggest swapping shirts and he could be heard saying he wanted to shake hands, but between the language barrier and the fact this had already gone too far, it didn\u2019t turn out that way, Lautaro Mart\u00ednez and Sergio Ag\u00fcero among those stepping in. Lisandro Mart\u00ednez ended it, eventually heading towards the dressing room, saying: \u201cWe\u2019re more of a team.\u201d"

                    "body": "The human rights campaigner Peter Tatchell has been stopped by police in Qatar while staging a protest against the Gulf state\u2019s criminalisation of LGBTQ+ people. Tatchell\u2019s protest outside the National Museum of Qatar in the capital, Doha, comes less than a month before the start of the Fifa World Cup, which is expected to attract 1.2 million visitors from around the world. Reuters reported that two uniformed police officers and three plainclothes officials arrived at the scene, taking possession of his placard and photographing Tatchell\u2019s passport and other papers, and those of a man accompanying him. Reuters said police left after shaking hands with Tatchell, who remained on the sidewalk. Tatchell said he and a colleague, Simon Harris, who filmed the protest, were arrested and detained at the scene but the Qatari government has denied this. The veteran campaigner was holding a placard that read: \u201cQatar arrests, jails &amp; subjects LGBTs to \u2018conversion\u2019 #QatarAntiGay.\u201d The Peter Tatchell Foundation said it was the first LGBT+ protest in Qatar or any Gulf state. The incident adds to mounting pressure on Qatar over its treatment of the LGBTQ+ community and migrant workers, as well as other human rights concerns. Qatari law criminalises both male and female homosexuality, with sentences of one to three years for adults convicted of consensual gay or lesbian sex. Speaking via Zoom from Doha international airport, Tatchell said he was arrested and detained on the roadside by Qatari authorities for 49 minutes after protesting outside the museum for 35 minutes. He said: \u201cThe first carload of security officials arrived in an unmarked Land Rover and started taking photographs. Then about five minutes later a police car arrived. The police came over and took away the placard and began to interrogate me. \u201cThey then notice that my colleague was taking photographs and videos, [and] confiscated his phone, and deleted photographs and videos. They took our passports and boarding passes. We were not allowed to leave or to to continue the protest. \u201cThe police were not abusive or threatening. But they did make it clear that we should go to the airport and leave the country.\u201d Qatar\u2019s government communications office denied that Tatchell had been arrested. It said in a statement: \u201cRumours on social media that a representative from the Peter Tatchell Foundation has been arrested in Qatar are completely false and without merit. An individual standing in a traffic roundabout was cordially and professionally asked to move to the sidewalk, no arrests were made.\u201d Last month, European football federations announced their intention for team captains \u2013 including England\u2019s Harry Kane \u2013 to wear \u201cOne Love\u201d rainbow armbands to symbolise opposition to LGBTQ+ discrimination in Qatar. Tatchell added: \u201cIf a Qatari footballer came out as gay, he would not he would be more likely to be jailed, than be selected for Qatar\u2019s national team. That\u2019s discrimination. It\u2019s against Fifa\u2019s rules, and Fifa is doing nothing about it.\u201d The human rights campaigner added that Fifa had failed to secure change in Qatar, such as legislative reforms on LGBT+ or women\u2019s rights, adding that the Gulf state had not fulfilled many of the pledges it made when it won the right to hold the World Cup. Tatchell\u2019s protest comes as Qatar\u2019s ruling emir attacked criticism of his country over its hosting of the World Cup, describing it as an \u201cunprecedented campaign\u201d targeting the first Arab nation to hold the tournament.In a televised speech before the emirate\u2019s legislative body on Tuesday, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani said: \u201cThe campaign tends to continue and expand to include fabrications and double standards that were so ferocious that it has unfortunately prompted many people to question the real reasons and motives.\u201d Human rights groups have credited Qatar with improving its labour laws since it won the right to host the world\u2019s biggest sporting event, such as dismantling the kafala system, for example, which tied a worker to a single employer, and introducing a minimum monthly wage. However, activists call for more to be done. Sacha Deshmukh, Amnesty International UK\u2019s chief executive, said: \u201cAttempts to silence Peter Tatchell simply for drawing attention to Qatar\u2019s outrageous criminalisation of LGBT people is a stark reminder of the repressive climate around freedom of expression in the country.\u201d"

                    "body": "The morning after its seven-game World Cup lifespan was complete, Stadium 974 \u2013 the shipping container one, a kind of elite Qatari hipster project, cod-Hackney to go with the cod-Paris \u2013 was already being dismantled by men with diggers and grabbers and electric wrenches.\nThis is the way of things here. Indeed, as the yellow-shirted travellers streamed through the night on Doha\u2019s driverless metro, another Brazil World Cup campaign done in a haze of tears and grief, it was tempting to wonder how long before the men who dismantle things would be out with their wrecking bars, setting about another Qatari World Cup fixture.\nOK, let\u2019s pack this thing up. Break it down to its basic parts: the magic dust and dandelion petals, the superstructure made from 974 recyclable velveteen codpiece boxes. Project \u20ac222m, also known as Neymar Jr, has run its course. Time to take down the icon.\n\nFor Qatar 2022, Neymar has been a key building block of the past five years, one of the key public faces of this global security-outreach project. He will remain urgently present in avatar form. The Neymar actualisations will continue. Take a walk around Lusail and before long you feel yourself drowning in Neymar content, Neymar iconography, boulevards of scrolling Neymar, lighted walls of Neymar.\nThe most relentlessly annoying of all the World Cup TV ads \u2013 an achievement in itself in a tough field \u2013 features a mind-numbingly cutesy child squealing \u201cImagine the city of the future! And Neymar is there!\u201d On cue, Neymar doggedly appears, already with a kind of glazed, hostage-scenario look. He does some skills, says \u201cno problem\u201d as though these are the final words his desiccated lips will ever utter, then fades out.\nExcept, it turns out we do have a problem. Neymar will not be in Lusail next Sunday. This feels like a kind of end point for all that. Neymar has already suggested he may not play another World Cup, has spoken of his own fragility in that glare, which is in itself quietly encouraging, a reasonable response to his entirely unreasonable existence.\nAs of Friday night his major-chord career, that sweet spot where a kind of ultimacy was still within his reach, is effectively done. Qatar made Neymar one of the richest athletes who has lived. Qatar has also made him into a kind of parable; a place where everyone, in the end, loses something of value.\nIt is five and a half years since Neymar was bought by the state of Qatar and installed at its Paris outpost. This was prime Neymar, the years still un-wasted in frolics and room-temperature domestic fluff. Lest we forget, this is a player who can, or could or might have done anything with a football on any stage, the closest of his generation to having that Lionel Messi everything-all-at-once kind of magic.\n\nEven at this World Cup, more than 600 games into his professional span, there was something almost comic about Neymar\u2019s lightness, his feel for the ball. What is this thing out there spiralling about like a grain of cosmic dandruff, like God\u2019s mosquito, like a speck of dust in the sun?\nNeymar had a fine game against Croatia, and scored a fine extra-time goal, conceived and executed in one movement. Had Croatia\u2019s one shot on target been saved then Neymar being his best Neymar \u2013 being, arguably, more Neymar than he has ever managed before at this level \u2013 would have been the story.\nInstead, we have this: exit music. There will be chances to win things. Maybe Messi can help cajole another Champions League win. But in terms of a defining peak, that ship has now pretty much sailed off the Al Wakrah docks. And there will now be an urge to mock Neymar\u2019s tears \u2013 so, so many tears \u2013 and to rejoice at the hubris; also to drag in the politics, his support for the despotic and dangerous Jair Bolsonaro.\nWhy does Neymar annoy people? Because he\u2019s annoying. The on-pitch theatrics have been grim to watch, most notably the Total Tantrum-Ball stuff in 2018 and the habit of always appealing to the referee, something the journalist Tim Vickery says has links to growing up as a futsal kid, a discipline where fouls are called constantly and the ref is always on hand.\n\nThen there is the gaudy inanity of his public persona. The interminable Netflix documentary, intended to showcase the real Neymar, did exactly that, revealing in turgid, painful detail the basic boredom and airlessness of being Neymar.\nA few years back, Barcelona spent \u20ac300,000 just to fly out his core hangers-on for his unveiling. More recently, one newspaper report involved Neymar allegedly threatening to \u201cgo on strike\u201d during Paris Saint-Germain\u2019s tour of China in order to force his own exit, a sentence so replete with toxins and bad things that just reading it feels like standing too close to football\u2019s exposed reactor core, eyes already staring to melt. Imagine living in that place all the time, forever.\nThis is perhaps the key point about the sporting life of Neymar Jr, beyond the sparkle and the rage; an inescapable note of sadness. Nobody does this to themselves. Football made this thing, the Neymar identity; football will do this, will take your talent and transform it into something grotesque. This is one more reason Neymar inspires such apparently genuine antipathy. Like so many things at this grand-scale pastiche of a World Cup, he can often look like a parody of footballing joy, talent, freedom. Here is the spirit and the beauty that made you love this thing; but reproduced now as a corporate-greed avatar, weaponised as propaganda and soft power.\nThe best parts of his recent career can get lost in this. Pel\u00e9\u2019s international goal record is deeply significant in Brazilian football. It is a serious achievement to equal it. And Neymar has been good at tournaments when he hasn\u2019t been injured, as he has been too often in the Champions League knockout rounds. I once saw him score four against Dijon in Paris, including the single greatest individual goal I have seen in the flesh. It felt like feasting on a hologram. Here was a stellar talent being expressed, pointlessly.\n\nPerhaps in the end the most notable achievement is to express more than any other athlete the idea of divine sporting talent as something entirely lost within the machine. Here we have an elite processed human talent-unit, a walking commodity chip, his chief impact on European club football to act as an agent of financial disruption.\nThere is a toxic flowchart you can draw, from Neymar\u2019s absurd \u00a3200m move to PSG, through the idiotic self-destruction at Barcelona, the smart plays and hedges at some clubs, the disintegration at others, the Super League chaos, the rip tides of pre-existing fear and greed that are still circulating. And for all the sense of stunted talent, of wings never fully spread, modern football is in so many ways his world, a place he captures more profoundly than any other individual. Imagine the city of the future. And Neymar is there!"

                    "body": "Qatar is facing renewed calls from migrant workers, their families, and rights groups to compensate for human rights abuses including wage theft, injuries and uninvestigated deaths, days before the World Cup kicks off. As fans and footballers descend on the Persian Gulf country for the month-long tournament, workers and their families, who have spent 12 years sounding the alarm on exploitative conditions endured while building the tournament\u2019s infrastructure, are seeking an amount equivalent to the $440m (\u00a3372m) World Cup prize money for a remediation programme. Qatar\u2019s labour minister, Ali bin Samikh al-Marri, has previously rejected such proposals, telling the news agency AFP that there was \u201cno criteria to establish these funds\u201d. Faced with scorching temperatures and a lack of labour protections, thousands of workers from Nepal, India, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and elsewhere have died in the host country since the World Cup was awarded 10 years ago. While the official number of work-related deaths during preparations for the $220bn project is three, according to the Qataris and Gianni Infantino, Fifa\u2019s president, the exact number of migrant workers who have died as a result of negligence remains unknown. \u201cMany migrant workers, their families and communities are not able to fully celebrate what they have built, and are calling on Fifa and Qatar to remedy abuses of workers that have left families and communities destitute and struggling,\u201d said Rothna Begum, a senior researcher in women\u2019s and migrant rights at Human Rights Watch. The unsettling human cost of the tournament is acute for workers such as Ram Pukar Sahani, who left Nepal for Qatar with his father, Ganga Sahani, in 2017, to earn money to repay family debts. In May Ram, who had returned home to get married, received a call from Qatar saying that his father, believed to have been healthy, had died while working. Ram recalled conversations with his father in which he would complain about his work and said Ram\u2019s job, where he was able to escape to air conditioning and had time to rest, was better. When Ganga\u2019s body was returned to Nepal, along with his 9,000 Qatari riyal salary and bonus (\u00a32,000) , no further action or compensation came from the company. His father\u2019s death, he said, was attributed to natural causes. \u201cThey are making this a huge event, but I lost my father,\u201d Ram said through a translator on Thursday. \u201cThere is no debt now, but it took my father\u2019s life to pay back that debt,\u201d he said. While the family received insurance money and support from the Nepali government, it wasn\u2019t enough, he added. Ganga\u2019s death is one of many migrant workers in the past decade that Qatar has failed to investigate, according to an Amnesty International 2021 report that says most migrant worker deaths in Qatar are attributed to \u201cnatural causes\u201d, or cardiac or respiratory failure. In May, Human Rights Watch and other non-governmental organisations wrote a joint open letter to Fifa\u2019s president, calling on the sports body and Qatari authorities to remedy past labour abuses and to compensate workers and their families. Earlier this month, 10 European footballing nations demanded that Fifa deliver a permanent workers\u2019 rights centre in Qatar and a compensation fund for migrant workers and their families. On Sunday, Amnesty International\u2019s secretary general, Agn\u00e8s Callamard, made an urgent plea for compensation to help families rebuild their lives. To quell mounting criticism, sweeping labour reforms were introduced in 2019, which included ending kafala, the system that made it illegal for migrant workers to change jobs or leave the country without their employer\u2019s permission. Other reforms included the first minimum wage for migrant workers in the region and harsher penalties for companies that did not comply with the new laws. \u201cThis is because of our blood and sweat,\u201d said Ram of the tournament, which starts in three days. \u201cLook at us, see our conditions, because there are so many people who have made a huge contribution, even losing their life, to make Qatar\u2019s World Cup possible.\u201d The Qatar 2022 Supreme Committee was approached for comment."

                    "body": "Morocco With one delightful chip, Moroccan right-back Achraf Hakimi knocked Spain out of the World Cup, but more importantly, united the Arab and African diaspora behind his side, making them both the default home team and the only team left to support.  This team of underdogs have lit up the competition and ignited a region that has suffered through decades of pain and violence. They play now for hope, for pride, and for all migrant communities who left their homes for better lives. Often the most intoxicatingly enjoyable part of a World Cup is knowing you are witnessing history. After winning their penalty shootout Morocco players bowed in prostration before their ecstatic fans, an instantly iconic World Cup moment, and a picture shared around the planet, in group chats across the world. Watching them is watching the region finally find something to cheer for. It\u2019s a chance to witness joyous history. How could you say no? Mostafa Rachwani  Argentina Although I will be supporting the ultimate underdogs, Morocco, there is no doubt that if ever there was a player that deserved to win this trophy it would be Lionel Messi. For many football fans like myself, the Argentina great has been the epitome of football for the entirety of our waking lives. Whether it is putting Jerome Boateng on his backside to send Bayern Munich packing in a Champions League semi-final, or single-handedly dismantling Real Madrid\u2019s entire team, time and time again Messi has sent us into complete ecstasy. In my mind there is no doubt that he is the greatest to ever play. I have watched his highlight reel at least once a week for the last decade and it still brings me joy and inspiration every time I see his greatness in action. Now in his last World Cup, there is one chance left for the magic man to finally ascend to his rightful place on the footballing throne.  A win for Argentina is a win for football.  Khaled Al Khawaldeh  England It feels deeply unnatural to suggest anyone support the England national team. After all, a key prerequisite for selection in the England team is Englishness, something I am usually opposed to. But despite that, I am unable to dislike its current crop of players. Marcus Rashford, the Manchester United forward, not only helped to feed millions of hungry children during the pandemic but also shamed a reluctant Tory government into doing the same. His teammates are similarly likable. Jack Grealish\u2019s goal celebration at the World Cup was a tribute to a young fan with cerebral palsy. He also has incredible calf muscle definition. Harry Kane is a vocal mental health advocate. This general sense of England being a team of non-dickheads has been widely noted. At times in recent years the squad, and manager Gareth Southgate, have appeared to be the only sane people left in Britain. But they are also just very fun to watch; from the pure joy of seeing Bukayo Saka dribble at defenders to witnessing 19-year-old Jude Bellingham\u2019s generational talent unfold, and Harry Maguire\u2019s enormous head. They are also playing France in the quarter-finals, a country whose disappointment and heartache should they lose is something the whole world can surely unite around. Michael McGowan  France When it comes to backing a World Cup winner, there\u2019s no favourite like the defending champs. Take it from me, someone who has next to zero knowledge about football. No team has won back-to-back since Brazil in 1958 and 1962, so the improbability of France winning again this year makes them all the more worthy of barracking for.  How do teams like to celebrate after winning the World Cup? With champagne showers. What would that be impossible without? France, obviously. What else do the French love? Striking, of course. For the uninitiated (me, before some recent Googling), the team refused to train during the 2010 World Cup after Nicolas Anelka was dropped from the squad. Solidarit\u00e9! Speaking of strikers, it would be remiss (according to a better informed friend) not to mention the bromance between Olivier Giroud (beautiful man, all-time top scorer for France) and the forward Kylian Mbapp\u00e9. At 23, Mbapp\u00e9 has scored more World Cup goals than anyone his age or younger ever has! He cites Albert Camus in notes! He\u2019s the frontrunner for the Golden Boot and Golden Ball, whatever they are! Which is all to say: Allez, les bleus! Donna Lu  Portugal At recent big tournaments Portugal have often been boring (for neutral fans) or intensely frustrating (if you support them like me). But with exciting youngsters (Rafael Le\u00e3o, Jo\u00e3o Felix), established top players (Bernardo Silva, Bruno Fernandes) and, finally, a more attacking style of play, a makeover is under way. Like an indie band that has always shown flashes of brilliance, it feels like Portugal are about to bring out a critically acclaimed third album. It\u2019s best to jump onboard now. But what about You Know Who? For many, captain and (arguable) \u201cGoat\u201d Cristiano Ronaldo is as good a reason as any not to support Portugal. Fernando Santos\u2019 dramatic decision to bench him in the first knockout game against Switzerland was monumental. More stunning was his replacement, 21-year-old Gon\u00e7alo Ramos, who repaid the faith with a stunning hat-trick in his first international start. To casual fans (and the football purists who like to go on about the other guy from Argentina) this Portugal is undoubtedly more likable. Forget everything you once knew, Portugal 2.0 is here. And you have permission to like them. Luke Henriques-Gomes  Brazil The first World Cup final I can recall was France 1998. Brazil had already won it four times, were raging favourites \u2013 and yet still seemed to have the rest of the world cheering for them. I bristled and wore a beret to school. Since then, I\u2019ve cheered for anyone but Brazil. Now, after a lifetime of resisting, I\u2019ve finally been seduced by the samba kings. In this era of hyper-professionalism in sport, when football leagues are described as \u201cindustries\u201d and styles of play are \u201cbrands\u201d, there is something pure about the unbridled joy the Sele\u00e7\u00e3o bring to the pitch. It seems they alone remember that team sport is about having fun with your mates. And look, they\u2019ve got a bloke who literally tries to dance like a pigeon and still manages to be sexy. As someone who ends up flapping about like a feral bird on the dancefloor despite my best efforts, I can only applaud. Joe Hinchliffe  The Netherlands As a sport devotee who has a particular penchant for suffering, I am putting my allegiance behind the Netherlands this World Cup. Any lover of the underdog should do the same. Why? The Netherlands hold the record for being in the most World Cup finals without ever having taken home the title. In the 10 tournaments they have qualified for, they have reached the quarter-final stage six times, and have never failed to make it to at least the last 16. They have been runners up three times \u2013 in 1974 to West Germany, in 1978 to Argentina and most recently to Spain in 2010. The Dutch have also never lost a World Cup match \u2013 without going to extra time \u2013 by more than a single goal. It\u2019s heartbreaking, to get so close and yet still be so far. To perform so well, with no reward. It\u2019s exactly why I love football \u2013 the pain, the unfairness of it all. And I lived in Amsterdam for all of a year, so I am basically Dutch. Caitlin Cassidy  Croatia Ask a football fan (and I did) why you should back Croatia, and they might tell you that they were perhaps the least-fancied among the remaining sides to progress, but nonetheless have a sort of unkillable quality. That they are an assembly of grizzled, hard-working veterans capable of suffocating the life out of the more expansive nations, that they are the football purist\u2019s side. But for me, geopolitics, national cuisine and random memories are the most important factors to consider when adopting a foreign World Cup team. Brazil get points for Bolsonaro\u2019s defeat but a penalty for a very beefy diet; the Netherlands crusades against international baddies via The Hague but served me some very dodgy cookies once in Amsterdam.  So yes, I\u2019m going for Croatia, mostly based on a lovely holiday in Dubrovnik ages before it turned into King\u2019s Landing and filled up with cruise tourists. There\u2019s a photo of me looking young and tanned and grinning like an idiot as I drink a large beer in an alleyway. I really enjoyed that time I sat on the beach reading the new Harry Potter that just came out. I also once spent a memorable day walking into the country through a minefield with some Syrian refugees. Go Croatia! (Let\u2019s not mention the xenophobic supporters\u2019 chants.) Nick Miller "

                    "body": "It must be difficult organising a major International Cricket Council event. You are tasked with bringing together the disparate corners of the cricket world in a festival of joyous inclusiveness, in a way that financially benefits Australia, England and India, the three most influential nations in the sport. You need a tense competitive format that makes sure that the most lucrative teams play lots of games before any risk of being eliminated. You have to promote your message of saving the environment by filling the stadiums with recycling stations labelled with the oil sponsor that pumps out 12.3m barrels a day. In between times you advertise your charity partnership to support women and girls playing cricket, while the same oil company funds the Saudi monarchy and one of your top-ranked teams represents a nation ruled by the Taliban.  The concern with the format dates back to the 50-over World Cup of 2007. When India and Pakistan were both knocked out their respective four-team groups in the preliminary stages, it meant they had played only three times. With their exit disappeared a vast television audience either side of the Radcliffe Line. With whispers of \u201cnever again\u201d, the structure of the tournament changed and has kept changing. In 2019, each team played nine times before the knockout games began. The 20-over World Cup is not quite so bloated, but still: perhaps a few people at the ICC would have been relieved that Australia\u2019s match against England was washed out on Friday. Filling the Melbourne Cricket Ground for a marquee bout between two great rivals was plan A, and a financially robust one with lots of TV viewers to capture and north of 90,000 tickets to sell. But that did not anticipate biblical precipitation, an Arctic weather front, and the fact both teams would be on the brink of being knocked out of contention after two matches of five in the group stage. It did not factor in an excellent day for Ireland earlier in the week, having technically knocked off the English in consecutive World Cup matches. Sure, the last time was early 2011, and sure, they might only have beaten England one other time across all formats in the intervening years, but those three wins come from only a dozen games in that span. With perhaps less foresight, nor did it factor in an Australia loss to the cheerful troupe from New Zealand \u2013 World Cup finalists in 2015, World Cup finalists in 2019, T20 World Cup finalists in 2021, and World Test Championship holders.  Those New Zealanders are a lot of the ICC\u2019s problems. Yes, they represent the triumph of determination over disadvantage, the indomitable spirit of the challenge, all of those wonderful sporting aspirations. They also represent a sales market of five million people, compared to the order of magnitude greater awaiting sales messages elsewhere. We love your plucky underdog shtick, but would you mind plucking the underdog somewhere else? The fur is getting all over the sofa. Then you throw rain into the mix. Most sports don\u2019t have to worry about being cancelled if things get wet. Cricket remains a special flower in the deluge. Tournament rain produces instant meteorologists, scoffing at the idiocy of playing a certain match in a certain place at a certain time. The same happened during the early weeks of the 2019 World Cup, the ending of which was deemed satisfactory. Rain happens wherever cricket does \u2013 that\u2019s how the grass grows. October may be slightly wetter than other Melbourne months, but it\u2019s drier than any cricket months in Sydney or Brisbane. The rainfall tends to be brief and scattered. This year it anomalously isn\u2019t. So be it. The Australia-England washout, then, cost the ICC some revenue, but it does keep two valuable properties alive for two more games. Australia is the host, driver of people through turnstiles and, thanks to historical aura, still the team that everybody else wants to beat. England have been the best in limited-over formats for years, led by one of the best to wield a bat in calculated short-form anger, Jos Buttler. Any administrator\u2019s mud-map would have had those two teams progressing to the semi-finals from one group, with India and anyone else from the other. But of course, the bottom line is not why we play or watch sport. We play it for Zimbabwe defending four runs from the last four balls against Pakistan, snatching a game out of the fire thanks to a spell from Sikandar Raza, who started impersonating Sunil Narine\u2019s bowling style only in his mid-30s. We watch it for Ireland\u2019s clinical dissection of England\u2019s far more vaunted bowlers during the fielding restrictions, setting up a rain-adjusted win. We watch it for the next result like this. Those results may not improve the finances of the global organisation, but here\u2019s betting that some of the organisers enjoy these anomalies much more than the results that do."

                    "body": "For Abigail Harrison and Scotland, the moment was worth waiting for. This World Cup playoff semi-final had rumbled into extra time before Harrison stooped to head in Erin Cuthbert\u2019s corner. Austria appealed in vain for a handball as Harrison enjoyed euphoric celebration.\nScotland will return to Hampden Park on Tuesday, when they will face the Republic of Ireland for a possible berth in Australia and New Zealand next summer. The element of doubt stems from a ludicrously confusing playoff process.\nOn this evidence, the Scots would not trouble the leading lights in the tournament proper but focusing on such shortcomings would be churlish. Scotland emerged from this dour, tense battle. Semi-finals are rarely pretty. This one was played in front of 10,182; a record for a Scottish women\u2019s competitive game.\n\n\u201cWe have spoken about inspiring and I hope people felt that today,\u201d said the Scotland coach, Pedro Mart\u00ednez Losa. \u201cWe believed in what we were doing.\u201d Austria\u2019s progress to the semi-finals and quarter-finals in successive European Championships rendered them strong pre-match favourites. Scotland did not even qualify for the latter of those tournaments. Nicole Billa, who notched 13 times during the group stages of qualifying, led the visiting attack.\nThe hosts, though, opened brightly. Martha Thomas almost beat Manuela Zinsberger to the ball, 18 yards from goal, before Caroline Weir\u2019s chipped effort was held by the Austria goalkeeper. In appalling conditions, this promised to be an attritional evening.\nIt took until midway through the first half for Billa to be afforded a sight of goal. The Hoffenheim forward\u2019s curling effort landed on the roof of Lee Alexander\u2019s net. Moments earlier, the Scotland captain Rachel Corsie had halted a promising Austrian counter-attack.\nScotland continued on the front foot. Only the late and crucial intervention of Laura Wienroither prevented Claire Emslie from sending the hosts in front. Weir, now of Real Madrid, was unsurprisingly central to all of Scotland\u2019s promising play.\n\nAustria finished the first period in charge. Julia Hickelsberger clipped the bar with a 20-yard shot. Yet the applause that greeted half-time was in response to a strong Scottish display.\nRealisation of the high stakes seemed in play during a cagey second period. By the hour mark, neither goalkeeper had been called into serious action. Alexander\u2019s fumble from a Verena Hanshaw free-kick almost posed a problem for Scotland but the ball was scrambled to safety. Scotland\u2019s failure to hand Weir sufficient time on the ball was responsible for their sudden lack of invention. This had become a scrappy, messy contest. Hanshaw looked to raise the standard, courtesy of a fierce long-range drive which flew wide of Alexander\u2019s left-hand post.\n\nHampden prayed for inspiration. The substitute Fiona Brown tried to provide it, with a header which failed to trouble Zinsberger. It had become increasingly apparent that the opening goal may well define the victor and, indeed, that extra time was a very real possibility. The situation was of benefit to Ireland, who could look on as Scotland and Austria slugged it out for the right to play them.\nSarah Zadrazil\u2019s darting run beyond the Scotland defence preceded a shot which sailed into the Glasgow air. The industrious Harrison won Scotland a corner, from which no player could connect. It had become that kind of evening. Even Weir, normally so reliable, dragged an attempt well wide after breaking free from the shackles of an aggressive Austria midfield.\nThe finest opportunity of regular time was soon afforded to Austria\u2019s Katja Wienerroither. Having bounded Sophie Howard off the ball, Wienerroither had just Alexander to beat. She miscued her shot totally, meaning Alexander was not even forced into a save.\nConfirmation of four minutes of stoppage time triggered the loudest Hampden roar of the evening. It also saw Scotland win a flurry of corners. From one, Howard\u2019s cute backheel failed to find a woman in navy blue. From another, Zinsberger desperately punched clear. Onwards to another half hour it was. Harrison had the crucial say."

                    "body": "STICKING TO FOOTBALL LATEST Gianni Infantino might give off major Bond villain vibes \u2013 the cosy chats with unscrupulous autocrats, the fleet of private jets, the impeccably lacquered bonce, the name \u2013 but really, he\u2019s just a nice guy in a tough spot, doing the best he can. After all, he wasn\u2019t in charge when Fifa awarded the Human Rights World Cup to Qatar \u2013 having taken the reins in 2016, Po\u2019 Gianni has had barely six years to make what little difference he can as the leader of world football\u2019s governing body. Finally then, with the HRWC\u2019s big kick-off six days away and with tofu-munching do-gooders adding to the chorus of concern over a lack of tangible progress in Qatar, Infantino had his big idea. Speaking to G20 leaders over lunch in Bali, he called for a \u201ctemporary ceasefire\u201d in Ukraine for the duration of the big bash in Qatar. \u201cFootball and the [HR] World Cup are offering you and the world a unique platform of unity and peace,\u201d Infantino cheered, as various suits asked to have whatever the grinning bald guy was having. \u201cMaybe the current [HR] World Cup can be that positive trigger.\u201d That\u2019s some serious blue sky thinking. And yes, we\u2019re sure critics will be queuing up to \u201chand out moral lessons\u201d (G Infantino, 2022), pointing out that a couple of weeks ago, Infantino himself wrote to every competing nation, urging everyone to \u201cfocus on football\u201d in Qatar and \u201cnot allow football to be dragged into every ideological or political battle\u201d. Presumably, ones that have nothing to do with the 2022 host nation are OK. Those same hand-wringing haters might also suggest that, as the recipient of a Russian Order of Friendship medal, Infantino has a better chance of getting through to Vladimir Putin than any of those sat around the table. Said tedious naysayers might also suggest that focusing on the plight of migrants would be a better use of Gianni\u2019s time, but he\u2019s way ahead of them \u2013 back in January, he suggested a biennial World Cup \u201cmight give hope to Africans so that they don\u2019t need to cross the Mediterranean in order to find, probably, death in the sea\u201d. Yet Infantino seems less keen to engage with initiatives that actually have a basis in reality, like the #PayUpFifa campaign, led by Amnesty and Human Rights Watch, calling for support and financial compensation for migrant workers in Qatar.  Infantino addressed the issue of workers\u2019 rights in Doha earlier this month, breezily claiming \u201csome criticism was raised, rightfully, and changes have happened.\u201d Since then, 10 European FAs have collectively called for \u201cconcrete answers on issues, [such as] the compensation fund for migrant workers\u201d. Infantino has kept his counsel since then, perhaps wary of an ability to lever his foot directly into his mouth every time he opens it. \u201cWhen you give work to somebody, even in hard conditions, you give him dignity and pride,\u201d Infantino said in May, before expressing an attempt at solidarity with migrant workers far from home, toiling in the heat of Qatar. \u201cMy family emigrated from Italy to Switzerland.\u201d Gianni is nothing if not a man of the people.

                    "body": "Fifa has been accused of failing to adhere to its own human rights commitments after it chose not to create a remedy fund for migrant workers injured or killed in Qatar.\nAn umbrella group comprising, among others, Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch has spoken out as the World Cup enters its final stages in Doha. It says plans announced by Fifa\u2019s president, Gianni Infantino, to create a legacy fund that \u201chelps people most in need all across the world\u201d falls short of Fifa\u2019s obligations, and undercuts assurances made before the tournament.\n\nIt has called on the game\u2019s governing body to change direction and help victims by using some of the $7.5bn (\u00a36.1bn) of revenue generated from taking the World Cup to Qatar to provide compensation. \n\u201cFifa can still do the right thing by channelling the legacy fund towards workers and their families, supporting a genuinely independent workers\u2019 centre and working with Qatar to ensure that every worker can access the compensation that they deserve,\u201d said Steve Cockburn, Amnesty International\u2019s head of economic and social justice.\n\u201cBy changing course, Fifa could make a lasting difference to the lives of the true heroes behind this World Cup. Refusing to do so would be a terrible indictment on its commitment to workers\u2019 rights.\u201d\nIn 2017 Fifa published its first human rights policy after criticism over the decision to award Qatar the World Cup. At its heart was a commitment to protecting human rights and remedying failures when they occurred, in accordance with the United Nations\u2019 Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights.\n\nTo date, however, Fifa has made no express promise to remedy workers hurt or killed during the years of construction leading to the World Cup. A Workers\u2019 Support and Insurance Fund run by the Qatari government claims to have paid out $350m to workers, but public evidence suggests it has so far been used to reimburse workers who have had wages stolen. Fifa\u2019s obligations exist above and beyond any government action.\nNGOs and charities, like European Football Associations who hoped to extract some form of legacy commitment, had extensive meetings with Fifa before the tournament and received encouragement only to be blindsided by a series of vague commitments in Infantino\u2019s bizarre speech that launched the tournament last month. Sources suggest there have been no further meetings since that date.\nNick McGeehan, the founding director of FairSquare, another member of the umbrella group, denounced Fifa\u2019s actions. \u201cInstead of ensuring protection of migrant workers who built and delivered the World Cup infrastructure in Qatar, Fifa has benefited from their exploitation and parroted Qatari authorities\u2019 talking points, showing their complicity to all the misleading claims and deflections on abuses of migrant workers,\u201d he said.\n\u201cFifa has tuned out genuine demands for remedy for migrant workers, including from the football industry, and ignored evidence of widespread uncompensated abuses and the inadequacies of the current compensation systems in Qatar.\u201d\nFifa has been approached for comment. It has previously said it would publish details of the finances of the legacy fund once the World Cup has finished \u201cin keeping with previous tournaments\u201d."

                    "body": "Formula One has confirmed the six venues that will host sprint races in the 2023 season. The sport will retain the current format for the sprint weekends in which the shortened 100km race will decide the grid for the grand prix on a Sunday. The sprint race was introduced in 2021 and since then has been held at three meetings each year. F1 has been eager to expand the concept and next year sprint meetings will be held in Azerbaijan, Austria, Belgium, Qatar, the United States and Brazil. Of the six only Brazil and Austria have previously held sprint events.  Next season the weekends will proceed as they have in 2022. Qualifying will be held on a Friday, with the quickest driver claiming pole position for the weekend. That session will decide the grid for the sprint race on a Saturday contested over a 100km distance, usually equating to a race of approximately 30 minutes. Points will be awarded to the top eight drivers on a sliding scale from eight points for the win. The fundamental issue of the driver who wins the race not being counted as having taken pole position for the grand prix itself, despite starting from the front of the grid, remains an awkward and unwieldy construction. F1 considers the format to have been a great success in its opening two years and it is widely supported by race promoters, who enjoy an additional competitive session on a Friday, and similarly by broadcasters. F1 states it has increased revenue and audiences, with Friday qualifying replacing second practice, which has limited appeal. However the general reaction from fans has been less enthusiastic. The majority of the races held thus far have been pedestrian at best, with drivers unwilling to take risks for fear of compromising their race on a Sunday. Equally the tense jeopardy of qualifying, the test under pressure in the single lap discipline, is a challenge many \u2013drivers included \u2013 prefer. F1 is known to want to further adjust the format, making the sprint an entirely standalone race, with its own qualifying session in order to encourage drivers to race more competitively. While that will not be adopted next season it remains under consideration for future years. The new venues were chosen after research into how suitable circuits would be for short-format racing. F1 has emphasised the need for overtaking opportunities, close racing and high-speed sections as crucial to making for a successful sprint."

                    "body": "A Scottish engineer who was held in an Iraqi prison facing extradition to Qatar over a bank debt has been released, according to a human rights charity that had been campaigning for his freedom. Brian Glendinning, 43, who had been contracted to work at a BP oil refinery in Iraq, was arrested on an Interpol red notice at Baghdad airport on 12 September. Glendinning, from Kincardine in Fife, was informed on arrest that the Interpol notice had been issued by Qatar over an alleged debt owed to the Qatari National Bank. Radha Stirling, founder of the Interpol and Extradition Reform (Ipex) initiative, said Glendinning\u2019s family are currently arranging flights and it is hoped he could be home as soon as Monday night. \u201cMr Glendinning\u2019s lawyer Tahseen Alchaabawi gave us the good news this morning. It was an emotional moment for his family and I couldn\u2019t be happier for the Glendinnings,\u201d she said. However, Stirling said Qatar had not confirmed if the Interpol red notice had been removed, so there could still be a risk that the 43-year-old could be arrested en route back to Scotland. Stirling previously said Qatar had a history of abusing the Interpol system and that the use of a red notice in Glendinning\u2019s case should be taken as a warning to football fans travelling to the country for the World Cup this month. Glendinning\u2019s brother John said he had lived in \u201cvile\u201d conditions in the Iraqi prison and his beard had grown as \u201cthere was only a single communal shaver in the jail and he wasn\u2019t going to use that.\u201d He added: \u201cHe\u2019s in the hotel. I\u2019ve seen a photo of him with a beer and I\u2019m so happy he\u2019s free. \u201cIt was really emotional for the family. Even our father teared up and he never cries. Kimberly (Brian Glendinning\u2018s partner), the children, they can breathe again. Now it\u2019s just hours until they are together.\u201d A class action lawsuit will now be launched against Interpol for what Ipex says is a \u201cconsistent and repetitive\u201d abuse of power, Stirling said. She added: \u201cIraq was furnished with evidence from Qatar National Bank last week to prove the extradition was over bank debt. \u201cConsumer debt does not meet the criteria for extradition, but it was highly likely Iraq would have succumbed to pressure from Qatar and handed him over anyway. \u201cBrian is free due to a combination of lobbying and media efforts, negotiating and settling the debt with QNB and strong diplomatic representations.\u201d A spokesperson for the Foreign and Commonwealth Development office confirmed it was providing consular support to Glendinning."

                    "body": "The rainbow flag flew above the Bourne Corn Exchange as South Kesteven council embraced LGBT history month. A year after voting against such a gesture the Lincolnshire local authority declared itself pleased \u201cto celebrate and recognise the [\u2026] rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people\u201d, hoisting the flag outside its headquarters in 2019. Across Britain, many other councils regularly follow suit, showing solidarity with their LGBT residents through their support of events such as Pride marches. Yet, as a Guardian investigation reveals, at least 28 councils \u2013 including South Kesteven \u2013 have been quietly depositing more than \u00a31bn of taxpayers\u2019 money into accounts at Qatar National Bank (QNB), the state lender in a country where fans who display rainbow flags at next month\u2019s World Cup may have them confiscated \u201cfor their own protection\u201d.  The investments pose a moral dilemma for western institutions dealing with the tiny, gas-rich Gulf emirate \u2013 whether to prize financial returns over principles. Some councils have pulled money out of QNB due to ethical concerns about Qatar, which has said it will welcome LGBT fans but where homosexuality is illegal, women are second-class citizens and migrant workers have died in their thousands. But others have carried on with the investments, described by the human rights campaigner Peter Tatchell as \u201cshocking\u201d. Investment firms, including Halifax and Hargreaves Lansdown, that flaunt their credentials on diversity, inclusion and labour rights, have also poured cash into accounts with the lender. Halifax does not appear to disclose this publicly. The investments take the form of funds deposited with QNB, which is 50%-owned by the Qatar Investment Authority, the $450bn sovereign wealth fund of the gas-rich emirate.  Amid mounting criticism of Qatar\u2019s record on human rights, the World Cup offers an opportunity for the emirate\u2019s ruling elite to secure their place at the top table of global culture, politics and business. Qatar National Bank has played a key role in laying the groundwork for the sporting extravaganza. During the event itself, QNB will be the sole provider of cash machines at games in stadiums. More importantly, QNB helped fund the estimated $220bn of the tournament. According to its annual reports, the bank financed the Education City stadium, where nine matches will be played, as well as infrastructure projects to ensure everything goes off without a hitch. Few people in the UK will suspect that, in paying their council tax, they may have indirectly helped QNB bankroll these investments. Yet freedom of information requests to every local authority in the UK show that at least 27 have invested more than a combined \u00a31bn with QNB since 2017. They do so as part of \u201ctreasury management\u201d \u2013 effectively the storage of council tax money due to be spent on crucial public services. Their deposits at QNB, which has just one branch in central London, reflect the search for yield that more than a decade of ultra-low interest rates has foisted on investors, from local authorities to high street banks. QNB pays a healthy rate of interest \u2013 nearly 4% in some cases, according to council disclosures \u2013 a useful return for councils struggling with cuts to central funding. Most told the Guardian that this was in line with their investment strategy. But not everyone in local government appears to agree that depositing cash with QNB is appropriate. Spokespeople for Trafford and Blaby, both of which have invested in QNB in the past, told the Guardian that they had stopped doing so, citing their ethical investment policies.  Ryedale said it did not have an alternative at the time it did deposit cash with QNB but admitted that the investment had been a \u201cmistake\u201d and said it would not do so in the future for ethical reasons. In Reading, the Green party councillor Josh Williams raised an objection to the council\u2019s investments in a country with a \u201clamentable\u201d human rights record, warning that Reading citizens might draw the conclusion that the council was \u201chappy to invest millions of pounds in a country that would imprison homosexual men\u201d. Reading\u2019s last investment was in July 2022. It says QNB\u2019s sustainability policy means it meets the council\u2019s investment criteria but that it has suspended further investments. Councils that still had millions invested with QNB as of October 2022 include South Kesteven, Argyll and Bute, Swindon and Portsmouth. \u201cIt\u2019s shocking to learn that local authorities are depositing council taxpayers\u2019 money with a state-controlled bank in such a homophobic country as Qatar,\u201d said Tatchell.  \u201cThrough these deposits, local authorities are supporting a bank that funds the World Cup and sustain a regime that stands accused of human rights abuses against LGBT people, women and migrant workers.\u201d Anyone who invests in shares may also have unwittingly contributed to the volume of cash deposited at QNB. The Financial Conduct Authority\u2019s client assets sourcebook regime (Cass) requires stockbrokers to deposit customer money with a panel of major banks, to ensure that funds could be recovered if the brokerage went bust. The banks receiving the deposits typically include well-known UK lenders but some share-dealing brands, including firms that publicly support LGBTQ+ rights, use QNB. Earlier this year, Halifax won praise when it gave staff the option to display pronouns on their name badges and told customers who objected to the move that they should close their accounts. The bank also espouses its commitment to gender equality. But the Guardian understands that the lender\u2019s share dealing arm, which manages \u00a31.5bn of money on behalf of its clients, has more than \u00a3300m with QNB.  Same-sex sexual activity is prohibited under Qatar\u2019s 2004 penal code, which criminalises acts of \u201csodomy\u201d and \u201csexual intercourse\u201d between people of the same sex. Women must obtain permission from a male \u201cguardian\u201d in order to make key decisions about their lives, such as reproductive healthcare or overseas travel, according to a 2021 report by Human Rights Watch. By contrast, Hargreaves Lansdown sponsors Bristol Pride and has won awards at the event thanks to its credentials as an LGBT employer. Yet the company, which also boasts that it is a living wage employer, deposits up to 8% of clients\u2019 cash \u2013 suggesting a maximum of \u00a31.5bn \u2013 with QNB. Fellow stockbroker AJ Bell also lists QNB among the banks it uses, with a maximum of 35% of client money helped there, implying up to \u00a334m. Not all stockbrokers publish the panel of banks they use to store clients\u2019 cash, meaning many more may have deposited funds with QNB. QNB did not answer requests for comment. Hargreaves Lansdown and Halifax declined to comment. A spokesperson for AJ Bell said: \u201cWe evaluate and monitor a number of factors when assessing which banks to use to hold cash,\u201d adding that this \u201cincludes a bank\u2019s independently assessed ESG or ethical rating\u201d."

Maddison scored twice and set up another goal as Leicester overwhelmed rivals Nottingham Forest 4-0 to secure their first win of the season. Only Erling Haaland has more Premier League goals and assists than the 25-year-old since 11 May but Southgate has repeatedly overlooked Maddison, whose last England appearance came as a substitute against Montenegro in November 2019.  Rodgers said he hopes Southgate gives serious consideration to finding a spot for the midfielder in his 26-man squad for Qatar next month. \u201cI would really hope that there was a place for a player like that in a squad, where you\u2019ve got someone who is so talented and such a hard worker and such a team player,\u201d the Leicester manager said. \u201cThis [Maddison] is a player who can come into a game and change the course of a game. To have that ability, if he wasn\u2019t starting for you, on the bench to come in and bring something in a tight World Cup game, it\u2019s what a team like England needs.\u201d Rodgers said victory for Leicester in the first east Midlands derby of the season could prove \u201cseason-changing\u201d for his side and reiterated that Maddison has matured since arriving at the club from Norwich in 2018. \u201cWhen I first came in he was a young guy, you see his haircuts, his bags and all of that sort of stuff, but he\u2019s matured. \u201cJames is an absolutely brilliant player and I really hope over these next few months he can continue his form and somehow get into the [England] team.\u201d Steve Cooper\u2019s position is under intense scrutiny following five straight defeats, Forest\u2019s worst run in a season since January 2004, but the manager insists his players are still fighting for him. \u201cYou didn\u2019t see the team give up,\u201d Cooper said. \u201cI know it\u2019s a group of players that care. I\u2019m definitely not sensing that [they don\u2019t care] at the moment. \u201cWe are trying to become a successful team on the job, in the hardest domestic league in the world.

                    "body": "Ruben Loftus-Cheek has revealed his relief at finally being fit enough to become a regular starter for Chelsea and has admitted it would mean the world to him if he makes a late run into England\u2019s squad for Qatar. The Chelsea midfielder has taken a while to regain his form after sustaining a serious achilles injury in 2019 and he has needed mental toughness to overcome some challenging periods. Loftus-Cheek knuckled down during the recovery process and he is starting to build on the promise he showed as a youngster.  The 26-year-old, who is in line to start when Chelsea seek to secure their place in the last 16 of the Champions League by beating RB Salzburg on Tuesday, has made 14 appearances in all competitions this season and has a chance to regain his England spot. Loftus-Cheek is well known to Gareth Southgate, who took him to the 2018 World Cup, and his form has boosted his hopes of going to Qatar. Loftus-Cheek said: \u201cIt would be amazing. It would mean a lot. Going into the 2018 World Cup you see your trajectory go upwards and to be at the next World Cup if everything goes well. A lot has happened in that time and I am just happy and grateful that I am fit and healthy and playing football now consistently. \u201cIf I go to the World Cup it would mean the world \u2013 but that is not at the forefront of my mind now. It would be selfish to think about my personal aspirations rather than the club at the moment.\u201d Loftus-Cheek, whose contract expires in 2024, won the last of his 10 caps during a friendly win against USA four years ago. Yet Southgate likes him and Graham Potter believes the Chelsea academy graduate would be an asset for England. \u201cHe has really impressed me on and off the pitch,\u201d the Chelsea head coach said. \u201cHe clearly needs a good fitness level to carry his body around the pitch but the quality is there. He is putting himself into the situation that he is one of the players Gareth is looking at.\u201d  Loftus-Cheek experienced relegation from the Premier League when he was on loan at Fulham during the 2020-21 season. He admitted that he has had to be strong to deal with the disappointment of his body letting him down. \u201cThe toughest side has been the mental side to it,\u201d he said. \u201cEven though I have had to put a lot of energy and work into the gym to get back to how I am feeling, the mental side of it \u2013 staying focused and diligent \u2013 and having the belief to get back to where I was, was the hardest thing.\u201d Loftus-Cheek revealed that a conversation with Andy Murray was helpful last summer. \u201cI went to see him train and play at Surbiton,\u201d he said. \u201cI am a big fan of tennis. We had a chat while the Laver Cup was on. It was good to see how he sees himself and his career, and the injuries that hindered him through it. He had a big one with his hip. It was a good chat to compare our careers and injuries have been a big part.\u201d Loftus-Cheek said he is feeling the \u201cstrongest, fittest and quickest I have been\u201d since his achilles injury. \u201cOver my career I have had injuries but I have always tried to find out what my body needs,\u201d he said. \u201cI have built up a library of things I need to do to feel good. That has taken time but I feel I know my body.\u201d Part of Loftus-Cheek\u2019s appeal to Southgate may be that he has occasionally filled in at right wing-back for Chelsea. England have problems on the right, with Reece James and Kyle Walker major doubts to go to Qatar. Chelsea, who will win Group E if they beat Salzburg, have travelled to Austria without N\u2019Golo Kant\u00e9, James, Kalidou Koulibaly and Wesley Fofana. Potter said Koulibaly\u2019s knee injury is not serious. Potter also backed Marc Cucurella after a difficult start to life at Chelsea. The left-back, a \u00a362.5m summer signing from Brighton, struggled against Manchester United last weekend and has been substituted early in each of his last three appearances.  \u201cHe\u2019s had a couple of issues, in terms of a bit of illness,\u201d Potter said. \u201cHe\u2019s been on antibiotics but he\u2019s a lot lot better. The reason for Manchester United was purely tactical from a need to get an extra body in midfield. He was the one that came out probably because of all the other things that have been happening for him. He was a little bit unlucky there. He\u2019s ready to fight for the team, he\u2019s ready to play. He\u2019s a resilient character, a really good person. He\u2019ll show his quality.\u201d Potter warned Chelsea not to take Salzburg lightly. \u201cTwo wins against Milan have helped the situation for us,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re not celebrating, we need more points. We\u2019re expecting a really tough game.\u201d"

                    "body": "Serge Gnabry was on the pitch. They thought it was all over. With Germany 2-0 up at a sullen Wembley, Hansi Flick decided to kick back and roll out his substitutions. On came Gnabry, trying to play himself back into form after an indifferent start to the season with Bayern Munich. On came Robin Gosens, spying a chance to reclaim the left-back berth. But with 20 minutes to play, the prevailing sense was of a winding down, a gear shift, an opportunity to knock the ball around as the stands slowly emptied around them. On this front, it\u2019s fair to say things didn\u2019t quite go to plan. Indeed, perhaps the clearest indication of the suffering Germany endured during those final 20 minutes came at full time. As the whistle blew, centre-backs Nico Schlotterbeck and Niklas S\u00fcle bent double, the weariest men on the pitch, having borne the brunt of a chastening late England assault. Kai Havertz\u2019s equalising goal had salvaged a little solace from the jaws of catastrophe. But Germany\u2019s body language told its own story: the basic dislocation of a team coming to the collective realisation that it does not know itself quite as well as it thought.  And so Flick\u2019s team will travel to Oman for their pre-World Cup training camp on a run of just one win in seven games, and with far more questions than answers. An initial relief at the passing of the Joachim L\u00f6w era has given way to a certain self-reflexive doubt: the suspicion that the underlying problems in this side go deeper than its ageing coach. None of these issues are terminal or unfixable. This remains a richly talented squad with champion footballers in every area of the pitch. But, right now, something appears to be missing. The old certainties \u2013 resilience, character, composure, defensive solidity, the ability to burgle a goal at the moment it is most required \u2013 no longer feel as certain as they did. If a lack of coherence in attack has been the defining theme of Germany\u2019s last few games, then here it was their brittleness at the back that was most concerning. Even before England\u2019s comeback there were frequent opportunities on the counter. Raheem Sterling had two good chances in the first half. And on the occasions England were able to play through the press, there was abundant space for them to run into: space that more often than not had been vacated by Joshua Kimmich.  There has been a rumbling debate in Germany over recent weeks about Kimmich\u2019s role in midfield, not just with the national team but with Bayern. His gifts are self-evident: a superb passing range, speed of thought, a preternatural reading of the game. What is less clear is how best to use them. Philipp Lahm recently observed that Kimmich\u2019s gradual migration into a more attacking player has blurred some of his defensive responsibilities. \u201cWhat is crucial,\u201d Lahm said, \u201cis that the roles must be clearly assigned. I don\u2019t see that at the moment. I don\u2019t currently understand his role.\u201d In recent games Kimmich has been deployed alongside Ilkay G\u00fcndogan, also a roaming, marauding sort of midfielder. When it works, it works extremely well: Kimmich receiving the ball from the defence and setting G\u00fcndogan off with a searing diagonal pass. But there were moments of confusion here, times when it was unclear who would go forward and who would cover, times when they both pushed high and left gaps behind them. Leon Goretzka, Kimmich\u2019s Bayern colleague and a more natural covering player, might solve the issue. But Flick seems to prefer the versatility of G\u00fcndogan, his ability to make late runs into the box, an insurance policy in a team not blessed with natural goalscorers.  In a sense this encapsulates Flick\u2019s dilemma: cover up one flaw and another one appears, like one of those sliding square games. Force Kimmich to sit deeper and you lose a creative presence further up the field. Bring the defensive line up and you leave yourself vulnerable to pace. Meanwhile the introduction of Timo Werner in the second half bolstered Germany\u2019s press, but he also missed two good chances. And while the return of Antonio R\u00fcdiger will shore up the defence, Flick still has issues to solve at full-back, where neither Thilo Kehrer nor David Raum has made an unanswerable case. This is, of course, a wildly open World Cup. But it is hard to recall a Germany tournament side with quite so many problem areas, with so little sense of its own capabilities. Was this an insipid collapse or a bracing comeback? Is this a team on the cusp of coming together or on the verge of falling apart? Not until Qatar, you feel, will we truly know the answer."

                    "body": "  12.28pm    I\u2019m going to sign off now. Thanks for your company and emails, today and throughout the tournament. We\u2019ve had them from all round the world: Israel, Italy, Kyrgyzstan, Philippines, Iceland, France, Antarctica, New York \u2013 and a south London coffee shop. I\u2019ll leave you with Simon Burnton\u2019s report from the MCG. Commiserations to Pakistan, congratulations to England \u2013 goodbye!      12.24pm    \u201cWho knew,\u201d says Gary Naylor, \u201cthat a shake of hands between an obscure rugby league administrator and a largely unknown Kiwi player in a dingy committee room would be such a momentous occasion for English cricket?\u201d      12.21pm    More from Ben Stokes  [What is it about you and World Cup finals?] Dunno. Good fun to play in though. It was weird: it felt like the wicket got harder as the ball got older. I made sure I stayed there as long as I possibly could; it\u2019s never really panic stations when it\u2019s under eight an over. The way Mo played got us down to a run a ball. Yeah, decent, decent. There was always gonna be a time when he had to attack an over, and unfortunately for Pakistan Shaheen had to go off. It was obvious what we had to do \u2013 that over was the big one.      12.16pm    Oh, just one more thing: Lorcan Tucker, thank you.     12.16pm    There\u2019s an endearing human side to this England team, and many of them are on the field with their families. As I type, Jos Buttler is holding his child and hugging his mum. I assume it\u2019s his mum. It\u2019s such a charming scene, almost enough to make you shed a wee tear.     12.13pm    \u201cDid you spot,\u201d says Tim Sanders, \u201cthat Harry Brook\u2019s interview response of \u2018So good, so good\u2019 matched \u2018Sweet Caroline\u2019 playing over the tannoy?\u201d I didn\u2019t, though Daniel Harris messaged me the same thing. So good, so good indeed.      12.12pm    \u201cBen Stokes is a ridiculous human being,\u201d says Matt Dony. \u201cHe\u2019s just different. He has that intangible quality that just makes things happen around him. I don\u2019t understand it, but it\u2019s there. Some artists have that same influence and ability to make things bend to their will. You could surround Bob Dylan by almost any band, and he would make them sound like \u2018Bob Dylan\u2019s band\u2019. The charisma and X-factor to control and direct his surroundings and stamp his authority over it. Stokes does that to sport. The whole field, both teams, the whole situation, just bent to his will.\u201d     12.12pm   ENGLAND ARE WORLD T20 CHAMPIONS!  Jos Buttler walks over to join his teammates, silly grin plastered all over his face, and lifts the World T20 trophy to the heavens! Four months ago they were struggling after series defeats to India and South Africa. Hell, four games ago they were struggling. But they delivered when it mattered, producing one devastating performance to batter India and holding their nerve in three tight ones against New Zealand, Sri Lanka and Pakistan. As in 2019, they recovered from a worrying blip to win the last four games, with no margin for error. Oh, and Ben Stokes took care of business when it mattered. It would be wrong to call him a big-game player; he\u2019s a huge-game player.   Updated at 12.15pm GMT    12.09pm   Jos Buttler speaks   I\u2019m immensely proud of everyone here. Matthew Mott\u2019s doing alright, isn\u2019t he? This felt a long way away after the Ireland game, but the character we showed in must-win games has been amazing. [Mott] has fitted in really well. He gives the players great freedom and allows us to to out and trust ourselves. Adil has been outstanding in the last three games especially. He\u2019s always been the guy we throw the ball to to make something happen. The chase wasn\u2019t easy at all. When you hit the right length there was a bit of seam movement \u2013 they were very attacking and obviously bowled at good pace. That man again was there for us, Ben Stokes. He\u2019s the ultimate competitor in everything he does. He has a lot of experience and can take everything on his shoulders. The impetus he and Moeen Ali showed just took the game away.      12.06pm    The England team go up to receive their winners\u2019 medals. I\u2019d love to hear Alex Hales\u2019 internal monologue right now.     12.05pm    Babar Azam speaks  First of all congratulations to England \u2013 they are deserved champions. It felt like home so thank you to all the supporters. We were 20 runs short but the way we fought until the last over was unbelievable \u2013 all credit to the boys. Our bowling attack is one of the best in the world. Unfortunately Shaheen got injured and it cost us. Maybe it would have been a different result, but that\u2019s part of the game.      12.03pm    Now the Pakistan team walk up to receive their runners-up medals. They made the tournament infinitely more interesting, as they always do, and some of their fast bowling on a spicy pitch tonight was dangerously exhilarating. Naseem Shah\u2019s figures of 4-0-30-0 are an utter scandal.     12.01pm    The presentation is under way. Sam Curran walks up to officially receive his player of the match award, and his player of the tournament award, and his wide yorker of the tournament award, and his into-the-pitch slower ball of the tournament award.     12.00pm         12.00pm    While Sky are showing replays of Stokes\u2019s innings, Jos Buttler charges over to rugby tackle his best mate and predecessor Eoin Morgan. Buttler doesn\u2019t let his hair down often, which makes it an even more beautiful sight (or in this case sound, a grunt of surprise from Morgan) when he does.     11.57am    \u201cI cannot even begin to tell you how much this fabulous win means to me &amp; my family,\u201d says Karen Thorne in Slovenia. \u201cEngland cricket matches have seen us through some very difficult times health wise for us all, &amp; this feelgood win has done it again for me, recovering from major surgery as I am at the moment. \u201cMy husband has worked on cricket as an engineer for many years &amp; my daughter has been working on this match at Sky studios. Congratulations England. Well deserved.\u201d Sport, eh?  Updated at 11.58am GMT    11.55am    Here\u2019s our snap report of England\u2019s victory      11.54am    Sam Curran is also the player of the tournament!  It\u2019s amazing. We\u2019ve won a World Cup in front of these amazing fans! Thank you to everyone who came out tonight. I wanted to be adaptable coming into this tournament. I haven\u2019t bowled at the death much in my career and that\\s something I want to keep working on, the same with my batting. I\u2019m not thinking about that now \u2013 we\u2019re world champs, how good?!  Curran finished with 13 wickets at 11.38. Only Wanindu Hasaranga, who played two extra games, took more. For somebody who bowls at the death, his economy rate of 6.52 is outstanding.   Updated at 11.56am GMT    11.53am    Sam Curran is the player of the match for his spell of 4-0-12-3  I don\u2019t think I should be getting us \u2013 the way Stokesy played there, he always does it in finals. We felt the wicket wasn\u2019t as good as we thought it would be. We saw how well Pakistan bowled and it was a tough chase. On this type of ground I go into the wicket with my slower balls and just to try to keep the batsmen guessing. I don\u2019t actually\u2026 world champions, how good! [Ben Stokes] is somebody I\u2019ve always looked up to. He\u2019s the man.  It was so sweet the way Curran jumped straight into Stokes\u2019s arms at the end of the game, simultaneously his fanboy and his peer.   Updated at 12.33pm GMT    11.49am    Adil Rashid comes over for a chat with the Sky team, pats Eoin Morgan on the back and says \u201cthank you for picking me in 2015!\u2019\u201d As well as the current squad, this is a triumph for Morgan, Trevor Bayliss, Paul Farbrace and Andrew Strauss. They started all this.   Updated at 12.15pm GMT    11.48am    \u201cBen Stokes, eh?\u201d says Simon McMahon. \u201cBloody hell.\u201d     11.45am    It\u2019s worth repeating: England are the first men\u2019s team to be world champions in both ODIs and T20s. There are no asterisks any more; they sit at the top table with the greatest white-ball teams of all time.     11.44am    You have to feel for Pakistan, who bowled sensationally at times, particularly Naseem Shah. The injury to Shaheen Shah Afridi, who hurt his knee while catching Harry Brook, may well have decided the game. We\u2019ll never know. Iftikhar Ahmed has to finish Afridi\u2019s over, and Stokes belted his last two deliveries for 10. That turned the game at a time when England needed 38 from 26 balls and were in a bit of bother.   Updated at 11.48am GMT    11.43am    Ben Stokes, cricket adores you  Thank you mate [he\u2019s talking to Adam Gilchrist, not us]. I thought the way we bowled; that\u2019s what won us the game. That was a tricky wicket with a bit of bounce; you never felt like you were in. With the Ireland defeat being so early in the competition, we had to address it, say what we said and then let it go. In tournaments you can\u2019t carry baggage with you. The best teams learn from their mistakes, take on the chin and move on to the next challenge. It\u2019s a pretty good evening!      11.41am    Harry Brook speaks   So good, so good. I always thought we were gonna win it and we showed the world how good we were tonight. I thought the wicket might be a bit better! I haven\u2019t played much Test cricket but I imagine it\u2019s like that.      11.40am    ENGLAND WIN BY FIVE WICKETS WITH SIX BALLS TO SPARE I was so excited I forgot to post the final score. Stokes finished on 52 not out from 49 balls, an innings that couldn\u2019t have been more well judged if he\u2019d written it on a computer program.   Updated at 11.48am GMT    11.38am    The England players all run to Stokes, a serial winner who gets high on the kind of pressure that sends 99 per cent of humans into the bunker. We thought Stokes\u2019s scriptwriter had retired at the end of 2019, his work done. Wrong! Stokes fooled us all by batting like a clown in the games that didn\u2019t matter, and then like a nerveless genius in the ones that did. Of all the gin joints in all the world, Stokes made his first ever T20I fifty in front of 90,000 people at the MCG.   Updated at 11.42am GMT    11.37am   ENGLAND ARE T20 WORLD CHAMPIONS!  Ben Stokes smashes the winning runs! Six years on from Kolkata and Carlos Brathwaite, he has had the final say in a World Cup final! \u201cIt\u2019s Ben Stokes,\u201d says Nasser Hussain on commentary. \u201cIt\u2019s always Ben Stokes.\u201d  Updated at 11.46am GMT    11.36am    Stokes plays and misses. England need one from seven.     11.36am   FIFTY FOR BEN STOKES!  Ben Stokes hits a full toss from Wasim to reach \u2013 and how perfect is this \u2013 his first ever T20I half-century. He looks to the heavens, to his old man Ged, and then faces up again with one needed to win.  Updated at 11.36am GMT    11.35am    19.3 overs: England 133-5 (target 138; Stokes 47, Livingstone 0) Alex Hales is having a fingernail sandwich on the boundary edge. Livingstone drives his first ball for a single. Five from nine needed. \u201c\u2018m in a south London coffee shop, just because this is where I was back in 2019,\u201d says Vic Rushton. \u201cI\u2019m even sat at the same table. Tension unbearable: come on England!!!     11.33am   WICKET! England 131-5 (Ali b Wasim 19)  18.2 overs Bowled him! Moeen Ali drags a wide yorker back onto the stumps, and Pakistan are still brawling. England need five from 10 balls. Moeen made a valuable 19 from 13 balls.  Updated at 11.35am GMT    11.32am    Mohammad Wasim will bowl out. Pakistan just want to take it to the last over and hope something absurd happens.     11.32am    18th over: England 131-4 (target 138; Stokes 46, Ali 19) Haris rams a serious bouncer past Stokes\u2019s head, but Stokes takes a single off the last ball to keep the strike. England need seven off 12 balls.  Before this tournament, I doubted whether Ben Stokes should be in this team. So did you, it\u2019s okay to admit it. I am a moron, you are a moron.     11.29am    17.3 overs: England 130-4 (target 138; Stokes 45, Ali 19) Haris Rauf has to bowl his last over now; Pakistan have no choice. Stokes cuts superbly for two, which brings the target down to 8 from 15 balls. \u201cSeveral members of our English pilgrim group in Jerusalem have abandoned a guided tour of an exhibition of the Turin Shroud to follow your coverage,\u201d writes William Cash. \u201cTest Match special doesn\u2019t function in Israel. To say we are all praying is an understatement.\u201d  Updated at 11.30am GMT    11.27am    17th over: England 126-4 (target 138; Stokes 42, Ali 18) \u201cIt\u2019s almost as if the spirit of Pakistan limped off with Shaheen Shah Afridi,\u201d says Ian Smith. It was such a cruel blow: for him, for Pakistan, for the whole game. But it is part of the game, and England won\u2019t apologise this time if they win. A huge over for England ends with Moeen top-edging Wasim over the keeper\u2019s head from four. Sixteen from it, and England need 12 from 18 balls. They are this close to making history as the first men\u2019s team to be ODI and T20 world champions at the same.     11.24am    16.2 overs: England 118-4 (target 138; Stokes 39, Ali 13) England are making a dash for glory. Moeen mullers Wasim over extra cover for four and then pulls another to long leg. That makes it 18 off the last four balls.   Updated at 11.31am GMT    11.23am    16th over: England 110-4 (target 138; Stokes 39, Ali 5) Ben Stokes, the pathological winner, could be doing it in a World Cup final again! He smashes four through extra cover and then pulls a flat six over the leaping Babar at long off. England need 28 from 24 balls.  Updated at 11.23am GMT    11.21am    15.4 overs: England 100-4 (target 138; Stokes 29, Ali 5) A huge let-off for Stokes! He mistimed a big shot that landed this far short of Babar running in from long off. He thought he was out and wasn\u2019t alert to a possible second run.      11.20am   Afridi leaves the field through injury  15.1 overs: England 97-4 (target 138; Stokes 28, Ali 3) Afridi is really struggling. He aborts his run up, then beats Ali with a half-ratpower delivery. That\u2019s the only injury he\u2019s going to bowl \u2013 he limps off to a standing ovation from the Pakistan fans, and the rest of the over will be bowled by the occasional offspinner Iftikhar. \u201cOn a rail replacement bus, running 40 minutes late trying to plan my revised route home whilst tracking Englands\u2019s progress,\u201d writes Kerry Haselup. \u201cNail biting doesn\u2019t come into it. Come on Stokesy.\u201d   Updated at 11.29am GMT    11.17am    15th over: England 97-4 (target 138; Stokes 28, Ali 3) Stokes cuts Haris Rauf this far short of Shan Masood at backward point. Then he survives an appeal for caught behind after missing an attempted slog. Pakistan have only one review and Babar doesn\u2019t risk it. Replays show it\u2019s the correct decision. After taking punches all over, Stokes buzzes Haris Rauf by clattering the last ball through extra cover for four. England really needed that. They need 41 from 30 balls, and Shaheen Shah Afridi is going to try to bowl.  Updated at 11.20am GMT    11.12am    14th over: England 89-4 (target 138; Stokes 21, Ali 1) Another run-out chance! Stokes is sent back, slips and is just short when the throw from mid-on flashes past the stumps. Moeen Ali, not always the best in nervy runchases, pulls Naseem in the air but safely for a single. Stokes can barely lay a bat on Naseem, who ends a memorable spell with scandalously unjust figures of 4-0-30-0. England are now only three runs ahead on DLS. They need 49 from 36 balls \u2013 and Shaheen Shah Afridi is back on the field. That\u2019s a huge boost for Pakistan, who are now arguably favourites. He\u2019s still limping, mind you. This is incredible stuff. And you thought the tension of 2019 was a one-off.    Updated at 11.15am GMT    11.06am    13th over: England 87-4 (target 138; Stokes 20, Ali 1) Ah, so this is why they picked Ben Stokes. He moves into the twenties with a fleet-footed cut for two, and Shadab ends a lovely spell with figures of 4-0-20-1. England need 51 from 42 balls.  Updated at 11.07am GMT    11.04am    This is a problem for Pakistan. Shaheen Shah Afridi, who is a key man at the death and has two overs remaining, has limped off the field straight after taking that catch. I think his right knee may have got stuck in the turf.  Updated at 11.05am GMT    11.03am   WICKET! England 82-4 (Brook c b Shadab 20)  Oh my word. Brook dances down the track and smashes Shadab flat and hard towards long off, where Shaheen Shah Afridi slides forward to take a terrific two-handed catch in front of his face. Brook goes for a useful if increasingly nervous 22-ball 20.   Updated at 11.16am GMT    11.01am    STOKES IS NOT OUT! 12th over: England 82-3 (target 138; Stokes 18, Brook 18) It was a wonderful delivery, which roared off the seam and was extremely close to the edge \u2013 but there\u2019s nothing on Ultra-Edge and Stokes survives. Naseem Shah is 19 years old, and he is bowling one of the great wicketless spells. England need 56 from 48 balls.  Updated at 11.02am GMT    11.00am    PAKISTAN REVIEW FOR CAUGHT BEHIND AGAINST STOKES! Haris Rauf is back on the field. Naseem Shah returns to the attack and beats Brook with consecutive deliveries. The first exploded from the pitch; the second trampolined over Brook\u2019s wild yahoo. Stokes walks down the pitch in an attempt to calm Brook down, and then Brook muscles a pull over midwicket for three. Haris Rauf does unbelievably well to save a run with a sprawling stop. Naseem Shah is bowling a scintillating spell. Stokes plays and misses at three consecutive deliveries; by my count Naseem has beaten the bat 10 times in three overs. Hang on, Babar has gone for the review with that last delivery\u2026     10.56am    11th over: England 79-3 (target 138; Stokes 18, Brook 15) Brook survives a run-out chance after backing up too far. Stokes drove Shadab to mid-off, where Nawaz\u2019s stopped the ball superbly but then threw off target. Brook would have been miles out. Just two runs from an excellent over. England need 59 from 54 balls. I don\u2019t have time to type the DLS par score every over, but if England slip behind it I\u2019ll let you know. Oh what the hell, the par score is 71. \u201cFollowing in Antarctica celebrating friend Keith\u2019s birthday.,\u201d says James Kynge. \u201cIf England win I\u2019ll be sure to let the penguins know.\u201d Just as long as they don\u2019t stop play.     10.50am    10th over: England 77-3 (target 138; Stokes 17, Brook 14) Stokes times a low full toss through extra cover for four, an outstanding stroke. This is sensible, low-risk cricket from Stokes and Brook. It was always likely to be a runchase full of moodswings, and for the moment England\u2019s world is relatively calm.  Saying which, Brook is sent back by Stokes and has to scramble to make his ground. We\u2019ve had 10 overs which means there will be a result one way or another. England, who are 12 runs ahead on DLS, need 61 from 60 balls.     10.47am    9th over: England 69-3 (target 138; Stokes 11, Brook 12) Stokes would normally focus on taking the game deep, but DLS makes that a little more complicated. In the 2019 final, England were probably behind on DLS from overs 19.3 to 49.4. Stokes gets his first boundary in fortunate style, under-edging a reverse sweep down the leg side. Eight from the over. England are nine runs ahead on DLS; they need 69 from 66 balls.     10.39am    8th over: England 61-3 (target 138; Stokes 5, Brook 10) The fourth paceman, Mohammad Wasim, is on for the first time. Stokes charges his first ball and cuts it for a single. England are slightly ahead on DLS, though that will change if they lose another wicket. Every little helps, and Wasim bowls consecutive wides before Brook whips two to cow corner. He\u2019s started with admirable serenity for a young player who had such a difficult tournament.  The moment I type that, of course, he misses an attempted drive over extra cover from outside leg stump. The last ball kicks to hit him painfully on the right elbow, and there\u2019s a delay while he receives treatment. This is quite some pace attack that Pakistan have. \u201cI am sitting on a French island in the South Pacific (New Caledonia ) so no chance of coverage of cricket on French TV,\u201d says Terence Ayres. \u201cReally glad you are there!\u201d I\u2019d be really glad if I was there too.  Updated at 10.40am GMT    10.34am    7th over: England 54-3 (target 138; Stokes 3, Brook 7) It\u2019s time for the legspinner Shadab Khan. Adil Rashid got a lot out of this pitch, so he should be a threat. His second ball beats Brook, and there are five runs from a (relatively) quiet over. In other news, Haris Rauf has left the field. Adam Gilchrist says he was followed by a couple of the backroom staff, so either he has a niggle or there\u2019s a really important horse race on in the next five minutes.     10.31am    6th over: England 49-3 (target 138; Stokes 1, Brook 4) Drum and bass is having a bit of a revival, and I believe, and that fresh track you can hear is Harry Brook\u2019s heartbeat. He defends his first ball calmly and then flicks stylishly through midwicket for four. Lovely shot. DLS can\u2019t come into play until there have been at least 10 overs, but as things stand the par score after six overs is 45.  \u201cAtherton, Smith and Bishop,\u201d says Laurence Boyd of the commentary team who have just handed over. \u201cJust brilliant, desert island commentators for me.\u201d I love them all, but I couldn\u2019t leave Nasser at home.      10.28am   WICKET! England 44-3 (Buttler c Rizwan b Buttler 26)  Stokes drives the ball back to Haris Rauf, who collects and fakes as it to throw back at the batter. This is his home ground in the BBL, and he\u2019s behaving like he owns the place. And that\u2019s why! He has picked up the biggest wicket of them all! Buttler felt instinctively for a very sharp delivery \u2013 he didn\u2019t need to play - and nicked it through to Rizwan. That\u2019s another Test-match dismissal in coloured clothing, and Buttler goes after a white-knuckle ride of 26 from 17. balls. It is well and truly on!    Updated at 10.36am GMT    10.25am    5th over: England 43-2 (target 138; Buttler 26, Stokes 0) Naseem Shah beats Buttler outside off stump three times in four balls; with the other going for four wides down the leg side. Told you Pakistan were merculiar. Babar belatedly brings in a slip. Buttler has the nerve, the skill and the genitalia to walk across and scoop the next delivery off middle stump for six. That is an outrageous stroke. Naseem beats Buttler twice more \u2013 that\u2019s five in the over - to end maybe the best of the tournament. How good is this? If Pakistan get Buttler, it\u2019s well and truly on.     10.18am    4th over: England 32-2 (target 138; Buttler 20, Stokes 0) Jos Buttler and Ben Stokes are at the crease in a World Cup final again. Stokes offers no stroke to his first ball, a sizzler that only just misses off stump. Good judgement, I think. He knew sweet bugger all about the next delivery, though, which snapped off the seam to beat him off the inside. Pakistan are on one. \u201cIf it was Australia or India chasing down this total we\u2019d think the game was basically over,\u201d says Bob O\u2019Hara. \u201cBut this is England, who can always find a way. It makes me feel almost patriotic.\u201d     10.15am   WICKET! England 32-2 (Salt c Iftikhar b Haris 10)  Haris Rauf strikes in his first over! Salt, who looked a bit jittery, slugs a pull straight to midwicket and goes for 10 from nine balls. This isn\u2019t over, not by a long chalk. In other news, get your DLS tables here, 50p a copy.    Updated at 10.36am GMT    10.12am    3rd over: England 28-1 (target 138; Buttler 20, Salt 6) Another glorious shot from Buttler, who times Afridi between midwicket and mid-on for his third boundary. He has 20 from 10 balls, Salt 6 fae 6. \u201c3-12 after all four overs in a T20 World Cup final against Pakistan,\u201d says Matt Dony of Sam Curran\u2019s performance. \u201c\u2018Fairy tale\u2019 barely seems to cover it. (Although, should we be treated to a proper old-skool England collapse, just imagine his righteous fury!)\u201d Two months ago he wasn\u2019t in England\u2019s best XI; now he\u2019d probably get in a world XI.     10.09am    SALT IS NOT OUT! The impact was umpire\u2019s call, so Salt survives. It was going on to hit the stumps, though.  I\u2019m too old for this.     10.07am    This looks really close. Salt missed a pull at a slower full toss that hit him on the back pad. Was he outside leg stump? If not, he\u2019s in trouble.  Updated at 10.08am GMT    10.06am    PAKISTAN REVIEW FOR LBW AGAINST SALT!     10.06am    2nd over: England 21-1 (target 138; Buttler 15, Salt 5) Naseem Shah\u2019s first delivery swings a long way to beat Buttler, but he responds with consecutive cover drives for four. That\u2019s the most emphatic response. Buttler edges well wide of slip for a single, then Salt inside-edges his first ball between his legs for four. This is pulsating stuff. The innings has barely started and they\u2019re already trading in the centre of the ring. \u201cFor those looking and failing to find the TMS link, try GuerillaCricket instead,\u201d says David Schaub-Jones. \u201cNot to everyone\u2019s taste but has kept me entertained from Hanoi to Medellin and many places in between.\u201d I think our beloved Gary Naylor is on that; he certainly used to be.     10.00am    1st over: England 7-1 (Buttler 6, Salt 0) That was the last ball of the over. Hales\u2019s fine tournament ends in disappointment, though he shouldn\u2019t reproach himself too much. It was a storming delivery.   Updated at 10.06am GMT    10.00am   WICKET! England 7-1 (Hales b Afridi 1)  Hahaha, he\u2019s done it again! Shaheen Shah Afridi ends his first over with the customary wicket. It was a sensational inswinger that beat Hales all ends up and deflected off the back pad onto the stumps.    Updated at 10.16am GMT    9.57am    The players are back out. In a surprising development Shaheen Shah Afridi, who is so good at taking wickets in the first over, will bowl the first over.     9.46am   England need 138 to win  They would certainly have taken that at the start, but let\u2019s not get giddy. If any team can defend 138, it\u2019s Pakistan.     9.45am   Key event  20th over: Pakistan 137-8 (Afridi 5, Rauf 1) Afridi top-edges Jordan over the keeper\u2019s head for a desperately needed boundary. There\u2019s a bit of drizzle falling, though not enough for the players to go off. Pakistan steal a bye to the keeper off the last delivery, which means England need 138 to win the World Cup. The last four overs went for just 19. England started nervously, but they were increasingly ruthless as the innings progressed. Adil Rashid (4-1-22-2, including a wicket maiden) and Sam Curran (4-0-12-3) were the stars.     9.42am   WICKET! Pakistan 131-8 (Wasim c Livingstone b Jordan 4)  This is outstanding from England. Jordan beats Wasim twice and then has him caught holing out to deep midwicket. Livingstone ran in and dived forward to take a difficult catch with such little fuss that the commentator Ravi Shastri thought he had grounded it and was walking back to the boundary in disgust.    Updated at 10.10am GMT    9.39am    19th over: Pakistan 131-7 (Wasim 4, Afridi 1) A typically good spot from Tim de Lisle: no batter has hit more than two fours. Whether that\u2019s because of the pitch, the bowling, the ground dimensions or all three, I don\u2019t know. Curran continues to befuddle the Pakistan batsmen. Wasim misses a hook at a typically slippery short ball, and Curran ends with extraordinary figures of 4-0-12-3. Somewhere in the afterlife, a former Northamptonshire allrounder is beaming with pride. \u201cWhaddid I say about Brook?!\u201d writes Andy Brook, who was critical when Brook put down a tough chance on Wednesday. \u201cTotal dropper! With you on his batting though.\u201d  Updated at 9.40am GMT    9.36am   WICKET! Pakistan 129-7 (Nawaz c Livingstone b Curran 5)  Sam Curran is having a night out in Melbourrne. Nawaz flicks a full delivery straight to Livingstone at deep midwicket, and Curran has figures of 3.3-0-10-3.     9.33am    18th over: Pakistan 127-6 (Nawaz 3 Wasim 3) Dropped him! Wasim slaps Jordan to backward point, where Brook puts down a tricky diving chance. Wasim steals a single \u2013 and then gets two more when Brook\u2019s throw evades Stokes backing up. Harry Brook is going to be a star, but his performance in this tournament is slightly reminiscent of Ian Bell in the 2005 Ashes. That said, Bell was brilliant in the field so maybe I\u2019m talking nonsense. It wouldn\u2019t be entirely without precedent. \u201cI don\u2019t think there is an overseas TMS link for this,\u201d says Tom Rebbitt. \u201cIt\u2019s not on the BBC website and BBC Sounds says it\u2019s only available in the UK. I\u2019m in Munich on the way to Houston, praying this concludes before I take off!\u201d  Updated at 9.34am GMT    9.30am   WICKET! Pakistan 123-6 (Shadab c Woakes b Jordan 20)  Superb bowling from Chris Jordan. He rammed a short ball into the surface, and Shadab could only clout it to mid-off. That\u2019s a vital wicket because Shadab is very dangerous at the death.  There\u2019s no doubt that England are on top now.   Updated at 9.45am GMT    9.28am    17th over: Pakistan 122-5 (Shadab 20, Nawaz 1) Curran\u2019s third over goes for just three, and he has unreal figures of 3-0-8-2. Before this World Cup, an old Wisden.com colleague \u2013 who is usually a superb judge - texted our WhatsApp group to opine that, \u201cI wish Sammy C would just eff off.\u201d Fair to say he\u2019s been reminded of it a few times during the tournament.  Updated at 9.29am GMT    9.28am         9.26am   WICKET! Pakistan 121-5 (Shan c Livingstone b Curran 38)  Sam Curran strikes again! Shan hoicked a slower ball towards deep midwicket, where Livingstone took a comfortable catch. He goes for a useful 28-ball 38, and now Curran is the leading wickettaker since the beginning of the Super 12s.   Updated at 9.54am GMT    9.22am    16th over: Pakistan 119-4 (Shan 36, Shadab 20) For the first time since the opening match against Afghanistan, Ben Stokes is going bowl a full four-over spell.  His last over goes for 13. Shadab hammers a cut towards extra cover, where the sprawling Salt can\u2019t save the boundary. Then he pulls towards deep square, where the diving Curran saves a run. Every little helps. Stokes finishes a mixed spell with figures of 4-0-32-1. \u201cI\u2019m with Jack Sidders,\u201d says Sara Torvalds. \u201cNot on a stag do in Vienna, admittedly, but I\u2019d love the overseas TMS link as well, as I\u2019m at home in Karis, Finland. Go England!\u201d     9.17am    15th over: Pakistan 106-4 (Shan 34, Shadab 9) Shadab slices Jordan high in the and not far short of Hales at third man. Shan, who is batting fluently, clatters Jordan into the ground and over extra cover for four. He has 34 from 23 balls, Shadab 10 from 8.  Pakistan are heading for\u2026 if not a par score, then at least one that gives their bowlers a chance. That\u2019s all they ever asked for/     9.12am    14.1 overs: Pakistan 98-4 (Shan 28, Shadab 8) Jordan\u2019s first ball thumps Shan on the side of the helmet, which leads to a break in play while he is checked for concussion. He\u2019s fine.   Updated at 9.22am GMT    9.11am    14th over: Pakistan 98-4 (Shan 28, Shadab 8) Shadab\u2019s a high-class legspinner himself, so he has less trouble picking Rashid. He muscles a boundary back over the bowler\u2019s head, and four singles make it eight from over. Rashid ends a seriously good spell of 4-1-22-2 by ripping one past Shadab\u2019s outside edge.  \u201cDoes anyone have the overseas TMS link? \u201c says Jack Sidders. \u201cIt is possible it was already shared but I\u2019m on a stag do in Vienna and I\u2019m struggling to read dense blocks of text at the moment.\u201d Blimey, is it Australian time in Vienna as well?  Updated at 9.13am GMT    9.08am    13th over: Pakistan 90-4 (Shan 26, Shadab 2) Shan Masood turns Stokes to fine leg for two. Buttler was very nonchalant about receiving the throw, perhaps not realising how tight the second run was. That said, I think it would have needed a direct hit to run Shan out. England have used up their fifth-bowler allocation now, though don\u2019t be surprised if Livingstone bowls Chris Woakes\u2019s fourth over, like he did against India. \u201cWatching from a sunny Naples hoping the weather will hold in the MCG, the home of Shane Warne, arguably the greatest leg-spinner of all time,\u201d writes Colum Fordham. \u201cIt looks like Adil Rashid is taking over his mantle with his guileful googlies and luscious leggies. He certainly bamboozled Babar. But the sheer unpredictability of Pakistan promise to make this a thriller. Merlot eh? Had a bit of the local Aglianico red yesterday evening but some strong tea seems to be doing the business.\u201d     9.04am   WICKET! Pakistan 85-4 (Iftikhar c Buttler b Stokes 0)  Another one! The dangerous Iftikhar Ahmed has gone for a six-ball duck, nicking a sharp lifter from Stokes through to Buttler. That was a Test-match dismissal dressed in coloured clothing.   Updated at 9.42am GMT    9.01am    12th over: Pakistan 84-3 (Shan 23, Iftikhar 0) The new batter Iftikhar is beaten consecutive deliveries from Rashid, who is bowling marvellously. In fact, that\u2019s a wicket maiden. The ball is turning a lot, which will interest Shadab Khan in particular. Rashid has figures of 3-1-14-2.   Updated at 9.02am GMT    8.58am   WICKET! Pakistan 84-3 (Babar ct and b Rashid 32)  Sound the match-up klaxon: Babar has fallen to Rashid once again! It was an unusual dismissal. Babar didn\u2019t pick the googly, tried to cut it and could only screw the ball back down the ground. Rashid swooped to his right to take a good catch. That\u2019s a huge wicket.    Updated at 9.15am GMT    8.57am    11th over: Pakistan 84-2 (Babar 32, Shan 23) Liam Livingstone comes on for Chris Jordan \u2013 and his first over disappears for 16! It was obvious from the start that Shan Masood was going to target him. After a couple of sighters, he smeared four back past the bowler and then launched a big six over long on.  \u201cHaving checked the weather radar for the 194th time today, I can probably stop worrying about complex mathematical equations and start worrying about things on the pitch,\u201d says Phil Withall. \u201cThere\u2019s an old sporting maxim about winning the moment and that seems to apply even more in T20, the shorter format offering less time for redemption. Fascinating couple of hours ahead. I still think England will win but I have been up for 16 hours and may well have been on the Merlot...\u201d     8.51am    10th over: Pakistan 68-2 (Babar 29, Shan 11) Rashid\u2019s second over is expertly milked for nine runs \u2013 two twos, four singles and a wide. Pakistan are manoeuvring the ball well, taking advantage of the huge outfield to put England\u2019s bowlers under pressure. That\u2019s drinks. I think both teams will be reasonably happy with the score, if not necessarily with how they\u2019ve played.  Updated at 8.54am GMT    8.47am    9th over: Pakistan 59-2 (Babar 27, Shan 5) Chris Jordan replaces Ben Stokes (2-0-14-0). Babar, who is starting to find that sweet, sweet spot in the middle of his bat, flicks a short ball off the hip for four. The usual ones and twos make it a good over for Pakistan \u2013 nine from it. Babar has 27 from 23 balls, Shan 5 from 6.     8.43am    8th over: Pakistan 50-2 (Babar 22, Shan 1) Shan is beaten first up by a nice googly. He gets off the mark with a swept single, which allows Rashid two balls at Babar. Sound the match-up klaxon! I wouldn\u2019t say Babar is Rashid\u2019s bunny, but he has struggled against him at times. Babar works both deliveries into the leg side for two, played with Fairy Liquid hands so that the ball takes longer to get to the fielder. \u201cFollowing the text from a bumpy bus outside Nairobi,\u201d writes Tom Wein. \u201cMy American colleagues were baffled by my protests that this trip clashed with the match. My Indian colleagues, who I normally count on to explain cricket with me, were strangely unwilling to help. Thanks for the coverage!\u201d     8.40am   WICKET! Pakistan 45-2 (Haris c Stokes b Rashid 8)  Adil Rashid strikes with his first ball! Haris charged down the track and launched the ball high towards long on, where Stokes steadied himself to take a simple catch. It\u2019s only Rashid\u2019s third wicket of the tournament, but he has bowled majestically in the last three games (and one ball). Haris\u2019s excitable 12-ball innings comes to an end, and here comes Shan Masood.    Updated at 10.06am GMT    8.37am    7th over: Pakistan 45-1 (Babar 18, Haris 8) Both teams still look pretty nervous. Stokes returns to the attack and rams a bouncer past Haris\u2019s attempted hook. That really zipped through.  Haris makes room to thump the next ball back over Stokes\u2019s head for two. He\u2019s batting very skittishly, but England know that his approach \u2013 and his hitting ability \u2013 make him a dangerous customer. Six from the over.     8.34am    6th over: Pakistan 39-1 (Babar 17, Haris 4) Babar waves a poor ball from Woakes round the corner for four, then mistimes a clip that lands safely on the leg side. Mike Atherton, commentating on Sky, says that the pitch looks a bit two-paced. I think Pakistan would take 150. Haris edges Woakes just short of Salt at backward point and then misses another heave on the run. But he finally gets off the mark from his seventh delivery, scooping Woakes gracefully over short fine leg for four. \u201cSam Curran is one of the mentally strongest sportsfolk it\u2019s ever been my pleasure to watch,\u201d writes my colleague Daniel Harris. \u201cTo deliver something almost all of the time but especially when it\u2019s most required, and without being as good as the best in either discipline - much as he\u2019s improved at T20 bowling - is seriously mindblowing.\u201d What I like about him is that he has both bronca and a very high sporting IQ. The two don\u2019t always go together.  Updated at 8.35am GMT    8.29am    5th over: Pakistan 29-1 (Babar 11, Haris 0) Mohammad Haris, a stylish dasher whose hero is Jos Buttler, comes into at No3. He charges his third ball and misses an almighty wipe. The ball is shorter and slower, and Haris fresh-airs an attempted uppercut. That\u2019s a brilliant over from Curran \u2013 one wicket and just one run. He is now the joint leading wicket-taker among those who started at the Super 12s \u2013 he and Anrich Nortje have 11. Before the tournament, my nephew Aidan kept pointing out that Curran was 200/1 to be player of the tournament. I hope he had a bet on it. \u201cGood evening Rob from a weirdly autumnal Melbourne,\u201d says Patrick O\u2019Brien. Cricket fans here are focusing on their IODs and SAMs as much as their DRS\u2019s. Here\u2019s hoping the skies stay closed.\u201d Right: what\u2019s an IOD, what\u2019s an SAM and what the hell is a weirdly autumnal Melbourne.  Updated at 8.29am GMT    8.25am   WICKET! Pakistan 29-1 (Rizwan b Curran 15)  A huge wicket for England! Rizwan has fallen the ball after receiving treatment. He chased a wide, wobble-seam delivery, angled across from over the wicket, and dragged it back onto the stumps. Sam Curran, England\u2019s bowler of the tournament, has another wicket.    Updated at 8.41am GMT    8.23am    4.1 overs: Pakistan 28-0 (Rizwan 15, Babar 11) Rizwan needs treatment after diving for a single and jamming his right eye against the grille of the helmet. There\u2019s a bit of bruising but he looks fine.     8.22am    4th over: Pakistan 28-0 (Rizwan 15, Babar 10) Only Virat Kohli and Aaron Finch have scored more T20 runs against England than these two. Rizwan adds six to his career total, slog-sweeping Woakes \u2013 yep, slog-sweeping Woakes \u2013 high over square leg. It was a slower ball, but even so: shot! Rizwan, busy as ever, steals a single off the next ball. He is the most infectious, effervescent cricketer, just a pleasure to watch even when he is shattering your partisan dreams. Babar still hasn\u2019t hit a boundary, but he gets three with a slightly mistimed flick over mid-on. I was going to say that if Babar is mistiming it, the pitch can\u2019t be great, but he\u2019s spent most of the tournament failing to locate the middle. The great Osman Samiuddin wrote a terrific piece on it. \u201cWhat\u2019s all this?\u201d says Brendan Large. \u201cThis was not in my plans. I was thinking I could sleep in whilst occasionally checking the OBO for updates on how deep under water the MCG was. Now all my usual nerves have kicked in and I have a sweat on. At least bowling first means England can\u2019t quite lose it in the first half hour, but they could go a long way to winning if they get the openers early doors. Fingers crossed that rain doesn\u2019t play the deciding role here.\u201d    Updated at 8.36am GMT    8.17am    3rd over: Pakistan 16-0 (Rizwan 7, Babar 6) Sam Curran replaces Stokes and beats Babar with his first and fifth deliveries, both angled across him from over the wicket. A good over ends with a big inswinger that hits Babar high on the pad.  For most teams this would be a slow start. Pakistan do things differently.     8.12am    2nd over: Pakistan 12-0 (Rizwan 4, Babar 5) Both teams have started nervously, England in particular, and Chris Woakes\u2019 first ball is a leg-side wide that Babar ignores. There\u2019s a bit of swing for Woakes too, who is pitching the ball up as a result. He hasn\u2019t quite got his line right though, and there are three singles on the leg side.     8.07am    1st over: Pakistan 8-0 (Rizwan 3, Babar 3) The first delivery of the match is a front-foot no-ball from Ben Stokes. Tremendous stuff. It was a good delivery, actually, a full-length outswinger that Rizwan defended, but replays showed he had overstepped. Stokes follows that with a wide, so the free hit rolls over, but he makes the best of a bad job with a nasty lifter that thumps Rizwan on the body. It\u2019s supposed to be a free hit for the batter, not the bowler. There\u2019s definitely some swing from Stokes, so he might get a second over. Rizwan plays tip and run to mid-off and is well short of his ground when Jordan\u2019s throw misses the stumps. England couldn\u2019t have wanted a better fielder to have an early run-out chance. An eventful over concludes with Babar cutting a short ball for three. That\u2019s not the length to bowl, Benjamin. England bowled way too short against Ireland in similar conditions and were punished.   Updated at 8.16am GMT    8.00am    Here come Mohammad Rizwan and Babar Azam, simply the greatest T20 opening partnership of all time. It looks like Ben Stokes will bowl the first over. Let\u2019s get this thing under way.  Updated at 8.02am GMT    7.59am    \u201cMy two sons are sat high up in the MCG on, they say, a lovely evening,\u201d writes Rob Lewis. \u201cJosh is naturally supporting England, but so is Will, who is my Aussie son. Who is the neutral going for in this final? Indians surely for us, but most red-blood Aussies and I suspect others, will go for Pakistan\u2026\u201d Without doubt. I\u2019m an England fan and there\u2019s a big part of my subconscious that wants Pakistan to win.     7.57am    Tense, nervous headache? I\u2019ll say!     7.56am     The last time the MCG hosted a World Cup final (the women\u2019s T20 a couple of years back) Katy Perry was the pre-match entertainment. We\u2019ve got Icehouse. Their UK peak was a No13 hit with Hey Little Girl in 1983.      7.54am    The magic number      7.53am    The players walk onto the field for the national anthems. The atmosphere at the MCG is incredible.   Updated at 8.08am GMT    7.41am    I\u2019m off to grab a coffee. See you in a few minutes for the World Cup bleeding final.     7.39am    \u201cI think Buttler opting to bowl is a shrewd move in a potential 10-over thrash,\u201d says Tom Van der Gucht. \u201cIf the rain materialises, there\u2019s a chance the Pakistan openers would have crawled to 50 for no wicket and would miss out on the opportunity to accelerate through the gears after laying a solid platform. This pressure might also force them to take more risks and abandon their normal game plan too.\u201d Yes, on balance it\u2019s the right decision \u2013 but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s the big advantage that it was in the early days of DLS T20 calculations.     7.38am    \u201cThis is a repeat of an occasion that virtually changed the fate of Pakistan,\u201d says Zain Malik, time-travelling back to 25 March 1993. \u201cA Melbourne final which saw the legend and myth of individual triumph become entrenched in Pakistan\u2019s public memory. In all its glamour, coloured shirts and floodlights, heroes were born defeating the mighty English in a distant land. Pakistan was announced to the world in style.  \u201cThirty years later, Australia is no longer a distant land. Babar is on the billboards and the MCG is expected to become a sea of green with the Barmy Army cowering to find a voice. Whatever happens, it is this beautiful sport that has brought this nation to the world.  \u201cIt is only Pakistan that can conquer the world through clumsy, stumbling, circumstantial luck. You\u2019ve got to love them, for they always give you something to believe in. For inspiring all the forces of nature to come together and deliver them victory. Go on boys, do this for the people.\u201d I would politely disagree with one thing \u2013 when Pakistan conquer the world, it has the square root of bugger all to do with luck. (Well, apart from Netherlands beating South Africa \u2013 I\u2019m referring specifically to Pakistan\u2019s games.)     7.34am    \u201cMy god, it\u2019s happening isn\u2019t it?\u201d writes Guy Hornsby. \u201cNo place I\u2019d rather be than following on this place, amongst fatalists and friends. The thing is, we are evens here, but you worry about early wickets as our middle order really hasn\u2019t fired. Now\u2019s the time I guess! So much on the opening pairs and bowlers here. And my twin brother is sat at the G, just in 6 range at mid off. What a day, Rob.\u201d That\u2019s probably England\u2019s biggest concern, because you have to assume Pakistan\u2019s new-ball bowlers will take a wicket or three. Jos Buttler and Alex Hales have scored 58 per cent of England\u2019s runs in this tournament; the third highest runscorer is Ben Stokes with 58.     7.27am    I can\u2019t quite believe that we are half an hour away from a World Cup final. All the signs were that it would be rained off, or at the very least have a delayed start.

Updated at 7.27am GMT    7.22am   England win the toss and bowl first  Jos Buttler says the weather is the main reason for fielding first. England are unchanged, though Buttler didn\u2019t specify whether Mark Wood was available for selection or not. There might be echoes of Robin Smith in 1992 \u2013 he missed the semi-final through injury, was available for the final but missed out. Surely England wouldn\u2019t leave Wood out though? It\u2019d be like leaving Robin Smith out of a World Cup final! Babar Azam says Pakistan would also have bowled. And they are also unchanged.  Updated at 7.31am GMT    7.22am    \u201cGood morning Rob from a gloriously autumnal hillside in Piedmont,\u201d says Finbar Anslow. \u201cAgreed, the two teams have nothing in common, except that they\u2019re both captained by ex Somerset players. Thanks for the commentary. Should be a brilliant match.\u201d It should, although we said the same about the series decider between these two last month. A Super Over wouldn\u2019t be a surprise; nor would a thumping victory for either team.     7.16am    The toss Teams usually bowl first when there is rain around, so that they know exactly what they need to chase. But DLS targets are tougher than they used to be, never mind the pressure of batting last in a final. There must at least be a temptation to get runs on the board while conditions are good.     7.11am    Meet the new captain, subtly different to the old captain      7.10am    England will wear black armbands today in tribute to David English, who died yesterday at the age of 76. English was a cricket obsessive whose Bunbury schools festival gave many England greats their first significant exposure.    Updated at 7.29am GMT    7.08am    Pakistan have a few dangermen, none greater than Shaheen Shah Afridi. He\u2019s the best in the world, perhaps the best ever, at taking a wicket in the first over of a T20.      7.05am    Team news Simon Burnton, our man at the MCG, says that Mark Wood has marked out his run-up \u2013 but so has Chris Jordan, so who knows. It sounds like Dawid Malan hasn\u2019t made it. I\u2019d imagine Pakistan will be unchanged; we haven\u2019t heard anything to the contrary.  Updated at 7.07am GMT    7.00am   Preamble  Hello and welcome to live, over-by-over coverage of the World T20 final between England and Pakistan in Melbourne. It\u2019s the best batting line-up in the world against the best bowling attack \u2013 or, to put it another way, the irresistible force versus the irresistible force. It is also \u2013 just imagine the reaction had you pitched this little beauty in March 2015 \u2013 England\u2019s third World Cup final in six years, and a chance to cement their legacy as one of the greatest white-ball sides of all time. No men\u2019s team has been ODI and T20 world champions at the time, not even the great West Indies side of the late 1970s. There\u2019s just one snag: they\u2019re playing Pakistan. Pakistan, whose cornered tigers savaged England so euphorically in the 50-over final on this ground in 1992; Pakistan, who do unto logic as \u2013 get your contemporary references here \u2013 David Brent does unto faxes from head office; Pakistan, who lost their first two games and were 50/1 to win the World Cup eight days ago; Pakistan, whose every ICC tournament victory \u2013 1992, 2009, 2017 \u2013 has involved them having the best view from the precipice throughout; Pakistan, who on their day leave even the strongest opposition wondering what the haal has hit them. That\u2019s the image we have of Pakistan \u2013 although, at the risk of being the pedant at the orgy, it\u2019s a bit more nuanced than that. In their own merculiar (sic) way, they have been the most consistent T20 team of all since the first World Cup in 2007. Nobody has reached as many semi-finals; nobody has played in more finals. The relationship between England and Pakistan has changed \u2013 there\u2019s lot more respect, and nobody\u2019s mother-in-law will be getting a mention tonight. The teams are also far closer in style and mood than they used to be. But they will never have everything in common. Take the opening partnerships. Both are world-class, both have beaten India by 10 wickets at a World T20 in the past 13 months, yet they have different cat-skinning methodologies. It\u2019s England\u2019s cold-hearted bruisers, Jos Buttler and Alex Hales (average partnership 74, strike-rate 158), versus Pakistan\u2019s careful caressers, Babar Azam and Mohammad Rizwan (avge 50, with a much greater sample size; strike-rate 132). Babar and Rizwan\u2019s century stand in the semi-final hammering of New Zealand was their eighth for the first wicket in T20Is. That\u2019s twice as many as anyone else. England\u2019s openers go harder because the teams bats down to No11. Pakistan\u2019s tail starts at No8, and they\u2019ll display it with pride \u2013 because Nos 8-11 are in the team to take wickets, and they can all bowl in excess of 90mph. Buttler and Babar know - as captains and openers, for richer and poorer - that each bowling attack has enviable variety: legspinners, offspinners, right-armers, left-armers. Whoever the batter, there\u2019s a match-up for that. The whole thing is impossibly exciting. Or it would be if we hadn\u2019t spent the last 72 hours looking at weather apps. A World Cup that has been defined by bad weather may yet be decided by it. When I went to bed last night I thought there was no chance to play today, and that I\u2019d be home in time for Dawson\u2019s Creek, but things are looking more promising now. The cold November rain is nowhere to be seen - Melbourne has been unexpectedly dry today, though the forecast is still for heavy showers both tonight and throughout the reserve day tomorrow. We need at least 10 overs a side for the game to be completed. If they can\u2019t manage that by tomorrow evening then England and Pakistan will be joint world champions, and supposedly responsible adults will start using that icky phrase about kissing your sister. The match begins, weather permitting, at 8am in London, 1pm in Karachi and 7pm in Melbourne  Updated at 7.19am GMT "

                    "body": "The forecasters got it wrong and England got it right, as the predicted downpour held off and it was Jos Buttler\u2019s side who reigned in Melbourne. And inevitably it was Ben Stokes, a man who always manages to crowbar his way into a big occasion, who scored the winning run as England sealed victory by five wickets, and a second T20 World Cup title, with an over to spare.\nIt was Stokes, when England last reached a T20 World Cup final in 2016, who bowled the catastrophic final over that cost his side the title. It was Stokes, when England won the 50-over title in 2019, who produced the miracle innings that kept them in the game. And it was Stokes, picking the ultimate moment to score his first international T20 half-century, who ultimately won his side this one. He is a magnificent cricketer, and also an irredeemable drama magnet.\n\nSo England become the first men\u2019s team to hold the T20 and ODI World Cups simultaneously, and in doing so become unarguably one of the great white-ball sides in the history of the game. For them to reach this pinnacle despite a string of injuries \u2013 and neither Mark Wood nor Dawid Malan, having been ruled out of the semi-final, recovered in time to play here \u2013 shows the depth of talent the country has developed. Beyond Stokes the 80,462 people present at the MCG witnessed outstanding performances with the ball from Adil Rashid and Sam Curran, but as the match tightened and tension built what was surely the decisive moment involved someone in the green shirt of Pakistan.\nIn what at first seemed a time for celebration, Pakistan\u2019s chances of victory disappeared. After scoring just 137, the bowling as they attempted to defend their humble total was spirited, skilful and often terrifyingly swift. In the first six overs of England\u2019s innings in particular, high-class seam bowling met aggressive batting in a head-on collision, and as is often the case with such crashes there were plenty of casualties.\n\nPakistan took the early wickets they so desperately needed as Alex Hales, Phil Salt and finally, to scenes of wild jubilation among an overwhelmingly Pakistan-supporting crowd, Jos Buttler were all dismissed in the powerplay. Hopes duly raised, from there they were simply unrelenting. Naseem Shah in particular terrorised England\u2019s batters with a remarkable spell of fast bowling that ended scandalously unrewarded \u2013 how Stokes, for example, survived the seven balls he was unfortunate enough to face remains a mystery.\nSo the game remained finely balanced when, midway through the 13th over, Harry Brook slapped the ball to long-off and Shaheen Afridi took a fine catch. But instead of sprinting away in celebration the 22-year-old, only just back from a knee ligament injury, called for help. He was helped down the tunnel but soon sprinted back onto the field, and attempted to push himself through one more over; it lasted one ball. Afridi started the night with a brilliant delivery in his opening over that swung into Hales, flicked off a pad and thundered into middle stump; by the end of it he was not even fit enough to collect his runners-up medal.\n\nWhatever Stokes was feeling as Iftikhar Ahmed prepared to complete Afridi\u2019s over it was not sympathy. He attacked instantly and remorselessly, and when Moeen Ali hit the first two deliveries of the following over to the boundary England had scored 18 off four balls, needed 20 more off 22, and the game had tilted irreversibly in their favour. Stokes ended unbeaten on 52, and Ali 19 off 12 before falling with the finish line just six runs away.\nIf Stokes was ice cool as the night ended, he was anything but at the start. He bowled the opening over of the night, of which the first delivery was a no-ball and his second a wide, and when Chris Woakes bowled the following over he also started with a wide. At this point the pressure of the occasion seemed overwhelming for all involved, and it was a rather undistinguished period of play in which the batters failed to take advantage of the bowlers\u2019 nervousness.\nThe fact that they came in this maelstrom makes the performances of Rashid and Curran all the more remarkable. Curran\u2019s four overs, two in the powerplay and two at the death, brought three wickets and just 12 runs, and before the trophy was handed over he was named not only the player of the match but of the tournament.\n\nRashid took two wickets and conceded 22 runs, and his four overs included a wicket maiden \u2013 in the 12th over of a World Cup final, if you don\u2019t mind. With his first ball of the night he tempted the dangerous Mohammad Haris to miscue to long-on, and he later took an excellent return catch after fooling Pakistan\u2019s captain, Babar Azam, with his googly \u2013 not for the first time. Curran\u2019s victims included Pakistan\u2019s two highest run-scorers of the tournament in Mohammad Rizwan, the first wicket of the night, and Shan Masood, one of three catches for Liam Livingstone at deep midwicket.\nBut other than the single over when Masood assaulted the bowling of Livingstone, Pakistan failed to show consistent aggression. And when they felt they had no choice but to be more ambitious, someone tended to get out. The result was a diminutive total, the sort that, particularly against a side with England\u2019s batting depth, only the very greatest bowling attack could possibly defend. Perhaps, in the end, they were just a slip away."

That was the headline instruction, front and centre, on the Polish website gazeta.pl on Thursday morning after the tense, chaotic conclusion to Group C the night before. Poland had stumbled into the last 16 of the World Cup with a performance so devoid of ambition that the domestic media coverage seemed more like a postmortem than a celebration of reaching the knockout stages for the first time since 1986. It should have been a day of jubilation. Instead, there seemed to be a wide sense of embarrassment. \u201cWe will not tell our grandchildren by the fireplace years later about how the Polish national team progressed from the group at the 2022 World Cup,\u201d wrote Dariusz Tuzimek for SportowyFakty.pl. \u201cWhen they ask about it, we\u2019ll try to change the subject.\u201d  \u201cShould Lewandowski be ashamed? The whole world saw that,\u201d was the question in the headline of Tuzimek\u2019s article. \u201cOne Wojciech Szczesny was not enough for Argentina and Messi, but still we got through,\u201d said Polityka.\u200apl, a reference to the goalkeeper\u2019s individual heroics in defeat, including a breathtaking first-half penalty save from Lionel Messi. Facing Argentina and Messi was never going to be straightforward. Yet it was still a frustratingly poor, disjointed display from a team that began the evening top of Group C and in control of their destiny. By the end they were left counting yellow cards \u2013 and praying. As has so often been the case at Poland\u2019s recent tournament appearances, Lewandowski was left isolated, despite Karol Swiderski being nominally selected to play alongside him. The Barcelona forward was left fighting for scraps: on the occasions Poland did win possession he sometimes battled impressively to win a free-kick around halfway. But he never looked like making a significant impact, certainly not compared to the ever-threatening Messi. Swiderski, who did not look sure what he was supposed to be doing, mostly became an extra defender rather than a companion for Lewandowski. Even when Lewandowski\u2019s teammates got close enough to link, it felt fragmented and lacking fluency. Despite a lack of service Lewandowski was not above criticism, either. Rather than attempting to inspire the team after they fell behind after half-time, he appeared increasingly withdrawn, his body language negative.  The closest Poland came to scoring, appropriately, was a set piece nodded fractionally wide by the centre-back Kamil Glik.  After the final whistle at Stadium 974, when coverage switched to Saudi Arabia v Mexico, it was an immediate reminder of what matches look like when both teams pose an attacking threat. The Saudis underlined the point during a thrilling conclusion by scoring a beautifully worked goal that in effect ended Mexico\u2019s hopes of progress. The former defender and Poland captain Jacek Bak said Napoli\u2019s Piotr Zielinski was the team\u2019s \u201cinvisible representative\u201d. He wondered aloud whether the playmaker had \u201ca mental problem\u201d when playing for his country. It seemed an appropriate question given the 28-year-old\u2019s indifferent performance against Argentina, give or take a couple of decent set-piece deliveries. Zielinski is the creative linchpin for Luciano Spalletti\u2019s Partenopei, who lead Serie A by eight points. They are unbeaten in the league, with 13 wins from 15 matches, and have scored 37 goals. In September they memorably thrashed Liverpool 4-1 in the Champions League. Where is that swashbuckling player? And could the fault lie not with the players but the coach, Czeslaw Michniewicz? Would Zielinski perform better in a central position, where his range of passing and searching runs could do more damage? He also needs someone to shore up the central areas to give him licence to attack. Unfortunately Qatar 2022 appears to be a tournament too far for the former Sevilla, Paris Saint-Germain and West Brom holding midfielder Grzegorz Krychowiak. There is a parallel between Poland\u2019s frustrating, traumatic history at major tournaments and England\u2019s travails pre-Russia 2018. They do not lack talent but they never seem able to fully show it, to become equal to or greater than the sum of their parts. Many of the players seem fearful of harsh media treatment, conscious of the anger stirred up when pre-tournament hype is regularly replaced by another limp failure. They have often been paralysed by the potential consequences of elimination, rather than motivated by the elusive rewards of success at a World Cup. The cumulative effect of so many disappointments feeds the anxiety.  The good news? They are still in the game. There were times when Poland succeeded in shackling Messi, \u00c1ngel Di Mar\u00eda and Juli\u00e1n \u00c1lvarez quite effectively. At times driving runs by the full-backs, Matty Cash and Bartosz Bereszynski, helped to make inroads. Collectively they must carry that defensive solidity into Sunday\u2019s last-16 meeting with Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 and friends. But they must also find a way to take the game to the world champions, to cherish possession rather than surrender it. Standing off and inviting pressure will be a one-way ticket home. Has anyone told Poland \u2013 and Michniewicz \u2013 that this is meant to be the greatest show on earth? Their supporters must pray they will find a way to release the handbrake against France. Support Lewandowski, unleash Zielinski. Zagrajmy w pilke: Let\u2019s play ball."

Croatia qualified for the Nations League semi-finals next year as defender Dejan Lovren marked his return to the team with a rare goal in a comprehensive 3-1 victory over relegated Austria in Vienna. Lovren, playing his first international in almost a year, scored the third goal for the visitors, who topped League A Group 1 with 13 points from six matches, one point ahead of second-placed Denmark. Austria finished bottom. Luka Modric gave Croatia an early lead with his 23rd international goal as he took a touch to control Nikola Vlasic\u2019s pass and fired low into the net. That joy was short-lived as Austria equalised three minutes later when Christoph Baumgartner glanced Marcel Sabitzer\u2019s cross into the net with a deft header. But two goals in three minutes midway through the second period sealed the points for Croatia as Marko Livaja headed home at the back post after a cross from Ivan Perisic, before Lovren was left free by the home defenders to score with a header from Lovro Majer\u2019s cross. Despite the loss, it was a special night for home forward Marko Arnautovic, who won an Austrian record 104th international cap and moved past Andreas Herzog at the top of the country\u2019s list of most appearances.      9.51pm    Reuters take on the Netherlands, who are on their way to the Nations League final with Croatia.   Captain Virgil van Dijk netted a second-half winner as the Netherlands beat neighbours Belgium 1-0 on Sunday to ensure top spot in their Nations League group and a place in next year*s finals tournament.  Van Dijk powered home a header from a corner in the 73rd minute at the Amsterdam Arena on Sunday to ensure the Dutch finished runaway winners in League A Group Four. They finished with 16 points, six more than Belgium who had a chance to leapfrog their neighbours, and take first place, but needed to win by three goals or more on Sunday to do so. Any hopes of a goal feast were quickly stymied, however, as the two sides effectively cancelled each other out in a tight tactical battle. The Dutch pressing game frustrated Belgian efforts at building up attacks, while a five-man defence for the visitors meant there was little room for the home strikers.      9.47pm    Reuters on France\u2019s loss to the Danes.   Nations League holders France lost 2-0 to Denmark in their final Group 1 game but salvaged their place in the top tier at the end of a dismal campaign on Sunday. Didier Deschamps\u2019s side, who will face Denmark in Group D at the World Cup in November, conceded first-half goals by Kasper Dolberg and Andreas Skov Olsen to finish third in their Group with five points from six games. Austria were relegated to League B after a 3-1 home defeat in Croatia left them bottom of the group on four points. Croatia qualified for the final four with 13 points, one ahead of Denmark, who burst into life against France after being dominated in the first 20 minutes.      9.43pm   Full-time scores in the Nations League  Austria 1-3 CroatiaDenmark 2-0 FranceFaroe Islands 2-1 TurkeyNetherlands 1-0 BelgiumLuxembourg 1-0 Lithuania     9.41pm   Full-time: Wales 0-1 Poland  Not the way Wales would like to sign off ahead of going to Qatar but this was a young, inexperienced team, with Gareth Bale playing only for match fitness, and who failed to make much of a free-kick in the dying embers. Much to admire in the performance of Brennan Johnson, but for now, Wales have been relegated from the elite section of the Nations League. Now for the next 58 days, and Team USA in Doha.      9.39pm    90+3 min: Wales push on and on, Brennan Johnson in the middle of it. Then Sorba Thomas takes the corner, and that\u2019s cleared. Moore heads down, and there\u2019s a claim for a handball, only for the Moore to be booked for his challenge on Krychowiak.      9.37pm    90+2 min: Bale heads against the crossbar! This time, Sorba Thomas\u2019 cross is perfect and Bale powers the ball beyond Szczesny and off the bar.      9.35pm    90+1 min: It\u2019s full-time as Denmark have beaten France 2-0.      9.35pm    90 min: There will be five minutes on, and Wales are at least pushing hard.      9.34pm    88 min: Wales waste a free-kick as Sorba Thomas, usually so good at these moments, especially for Huddersfield, just lumps the ball into the wall.      9.31pm    86 min: Thomas is now on for Roberts for Wales. Colwill, all bouffant hair and youthful promise, escapes down the left-hand channel. Johnson is waiting in the middle, and he can\u2019t be found. Szczesny has been a safe pair of hands tonight.      9.29pm    84 min: Score correction: it\u2019s actually Luxembourg 0-0 Lithuania. Must have been a VAR.      9.28pm    83 min: Poland making a series of subs now as they attempt to further run down the clock.      9.27pm    82 min: Matt Dony gets in touch: \u201cBergkamp-esque. Except, Lewandowski meant it. (Tin hat: On)\u201c Peter Oh: \u201cI\u2019m having a hard time keeping things straight. Tell me if I\u2019ve got it right: England are poor, Scotland are good, and Wales are mediocre.\u201d Alexander McMillan: \u201cSeems to me, it depends on who you think football is for. If you think it\u2019s for the serial winners (big clubs and major nations) then you probably don\u2019t like it. But if you think it\u2019s for everyone, and that all nations deserve the chance to progress and play against opponents of a similar level, then you\u2019ve got to be all for it. Lots of the \u2018lower\u2019 standard European sides showing massive improvements.\u201d     9.25pm    80 min: Wales\u2019 attacks have been rather less than fluid, with the Poles sat deep in numbers, and Bale, somehow still on the field, struggling to impose himself.      9.24pm    78 min: Scoreflash: Austria 1-3 Croatia, goals from Marko Livaja and Dejan Lovren are good news for France who are now likely to stay up.      9.22pm    77 min: Szczesny makes a fine save \u2013 again \u2013 James whipping in the ball from the left, and the Polish goalkeeper dived late to force it away from danger. Kieffer Moore might have been on the crime scene there.      9.21pm    76 min: Scoreflash: Netherland 1-0 Belgium and Virgil van Dijk got it.      9.20pm    75 min: It\u2019s getting even more bitty, with Poland running down the clock, they have plenty of experience in their team. Lewandowski buys time off a Cabango foul.      9.17pm    72 min: On comes Rubin Colwill, and off goes Levitt. That would seem to have left just Joe Morrell as a Wales central midfielder.      9.15pm    70 min: All huff and puff for Wales, who Poland are keeping at arm\u2019s length here.      9.14pm    68 min: Bogdan gets in touch: \u201cTell me honestly what do you really think about this Nations league project, is it good or bad for football? I just don`t know, in some way for me it has improved the international football since there are no meaningless friendlies but, on the other hand, there are more difficult competitive matches and the players get more tired playing not-so-important games?\u201d I am torn, I have to say. I sigh each time the Nations League comes around then enjoy some of the games. So it\u2019s better than friendlies, but then it\u2019s not the Premier League or a major finals. Hmm.      9.12pm    65 min: Scoreflash: The Faroe Islands are currently leading Turkey 2-0. The only other goal other than Swiderski\u2019s here is that putting Luxembourg 1-0 up on Lithuania.      9.10pm    64 min: Poland change: off goes Karol \u015awiderski, the goalscorer, and on comes Krzysztof Pi\u0105tek of Salernitana.      9.08pm    62 min: Wales staring down the barrel of relegation, and paying for not being able to take their chances and suffering for having Joe Allen and Aaron Ramsey on the bench.      9.06pm    60 min: Szczesny makes a great save, as Brennan Johnson comes in from the left, and the ball was arrowing in, only for the Juventus goalkeeper to make the save with his fingertips. Good football all round.      9.04pm    59 min: And as that goal went in, courtesy of a piece of Bergkamp-esque skill from Lewandowski, on comes Moore, and off goes Norrington Davies.      9.03pm   Goal! Wales 0-1 Poland (Swiderski, 58)  That man Lewandowski at the heart of it. Krychowiak\u2019s pass goes to Lewandowski whose flick takes out two Wales defenders and Swiderski smashes home.    Updated at 9.12pm BST    9.01pm    57 min: James seems to be the furthest man forward, and is having real problems holding it up. Bale surely to go off?      9.00pm    55 min: Yes, Moore is coming on, after a discussion with Rob Page, who has clearly seen enough.      8.58pm    53 min: Kieffer Moore is imminent for Wales, and they could really do with a focal point up front. Arwel Jones gets in touch: \u201cBale looks like an old man lost in the park.\u201d Yes, a little bit.      8.56pm    51 min: More groans for the officiating as Glik smashes into James, and somehow that\u2019s not given as a foul. It looked a forearm smash.      8.54pm    48 min: Neco Williams is booked as Bartosz Bereszy\u0144ski took a smashing, and comes back on the field to roll around. The referee rather awarded that one blind.      8.52pm    47 min: A slow start to this half, and will we see more of Bale who has a free role as ever.      8.51pm    46 min: Back underway in Cardiff. with Poland getting it launched to the back stick from the kick-off.      8.37pm   Half-time scores in the Nations League  Austria 1-1 CroatiaDenmark 2-0 FranceFaroe Islands 0-0 TurkeyNetherlands 0-0 BelgiumLuxembourg 0-0 Lithuania     8.35pm   Half-time: Wales 0-0 Poland  As it stands, Wales will get relegated from the Nations League top tier. They finish the half with Szczesny making brave save from Gareth Bale, and the two share a handshake as the whistle goes. Dan James had the best chance of the game, and perhaps stopped Brennan Johnson having a better one. Still, an inexperienced Wales team is holding its own.      8.33pm    45+1 min: Bednarek is not booked when James looked to have escaped at the halfway line. Lucky boy. That\u2019s a yellow in the Barclays. Three minutes added on here.      8.32pm    45 min: Wales have been a bit better as this half has gone on, without ever throwing much in the way of passing together. Brennan Johnson, who is so lively, is caught offside.      8.29pm    43 min: Norrington-Davies is booked, having smashed into Lewandowski, who does take his time coming back up. He\u2019s still wiping his brow as he gets up.      8.28pm    42 min: So close for Wales. Brennan Johnson speeds forward, unleashes a shot and it might well have been going in, only for the ball to come off Dan James and go wide.      8.27pm    40 min: Scoreflash: Denmark 2-0 France; Andreas Olsen has got it.      8.26pm    39 min: Almost a horror moment, for Wayne Hennessey, who almost did a Peter Enckelman, a Scott Carson, a David de Gea, from a back-pass from Norrington-Davies, I think \u2013 Rodon maybe. Hennessey makes amends by making a save soon after.  Updated at 8.28pm BST    8.24pm    38 min: Szczesny has to come out and stop Gareth Bale, who had just escaped after a throw-in. The LA king has been quiet, it has to be said.   Updated at 9.02pm BST    8.22pm    36 min: West Brom and PSG legend Grzegorz Krychowiak is booked for a foul on Morrell, wrapping his arm around the Portsmouth man, and shunting him to the ground.      8.20pm    34 min: Scoreflash: Denmark 1-0 France, Kasper Dolberg got it and, like England, the French could be headed for Nations League relegation.;  Updated at 8.23pm BST    8.19pm    33 min: Dan James does a Dan James thing, sent away by Cabango\u2019s clearance, and it\u2019s one on one. He\u2019s up against Szczesny, who saves not once, but twice. Perhaps it was the weaker foot for James but we\u2019ve all seen James fail to make the most of those chances.      8.17pm    31 min: Connor Roberts goes close\u2026no, he had fouled Zalewski in trying to win the header. The Polish defender holds his head, though actually took a blow to the back. Then there\u2019s some afters, dealt out by Lewandowski. Roberts\u2019 turn to make something of a foul. No love lost in the Nations League.      8.15pm    29 min: Joe Rodon, the senior Welsh defender tonight, has to clear a ball from the flank. It\u2019s not been an easy first 30 minutes for Wales. Their attacking fliers have seen very little of the ball.      8.12pm    27 min: Poland chance! Hennessey hangs on gratefully as Zielinski\u2019s cross is headed downwards. Poland beginning to pile up the pressure now, dominating possession.      8.10pm    25 min: Lewandowski falls to the floor, grabbing his face, some theatrics on show from the Poles here? No, Cabango had walloped him across the chops, the Swansea defender is one of those who isn\u2019t quite sure of a place in Qatar.   Updated at 9.03pm BST    8.08pm    23 min: Poland are not especially zippy in attack, though that\u2019s been a problem since Lewandowski started playing for them.      8.07pm    21 min: Scoreflash: Actually, there\u2019s been no Nations League goals anywhere other than that match between Austria and Croatia, where it\u2019s still 1-1.      8.05pm    18 min: Neco Williams to the rescue, a last-ditch job, to cut off a pass from the so far excellent Zielinski. Wales look shaky at the back to say the least.      8.03pm    16 min: Joe Allen and Aaron Ramsey look on from the sidelines. Allen, back at Swansea, has a hamstring problem, Ramsey has something similar, picked up while playing for Nice.      8.01pm    14 min: Wales have their first corner, Brennan Johnson forcing it, using his pace down the right-hand side. It\u2019s cleared after a push in the box.      7.59pm    13 min: Jeers as Lewandowski\u2019s loose touch allows the ball to go out. The great man will need more than that to put him off.      7.58pm    11 min: Matt Dony corrects me, correctly. I knew the difference, having covered the Welsh team at Cardiff\u2019s stadium.  \u201cI\u2019m assuming it was a simple mis-type, but they\u2019re not at the Principality. It\u2019s Cardiff City Stadium. Which is one of many, many things that that the Welsh FA are currently getting right. They could no doubt sell more tickets if they used the Principality, but the players and the fans want to be in Cardiff City\u2019s home instead. And even though it generates less revenue (especially considering the surprisingly cheap, family-friendly ticket pricing structure), the powers that be listen. The performances and atmospheres have vindicated that, and led to WC qualification, meaning a massive injection of revenue in the longer term. A clear strategy that has paid off. See also, fading out the music for the anthem and allowing the crowd to sing unaccompanied. It\u2019s enormously popular among fans, and although it\u2019s a relatively small thing, it makes a massive difference to fans. Are you listening, RFU? No, of course you\u2019re not\u2026\u201d     7.56pm    9 min: Zielinski is down, after a clash with Cabango, and the referee blows up, much to the consternation of the home fans. The Napoli player is holding his ankle but he\u2019s going to be OK. It\u2019s now Austria 1-1 Croatia, Christoph Baumgartner getting the equaliser.      7.54pm    8 min: Scoreflash: Croatia 1-0 Austria, Luka Modric getting the goal.      7.53pm    6 min: Ben Cabango gets his first chance to prove himself against Lewandowski. Then there\u2019s a flutter of hearts as Rodon is again loose, and there\u2019s panic before Hennessey slides out to deny the Polish through ball.      7.51pm    5 min: Some early touches for Bale, and then Lewandowski gets his first touch. Wales getting plenty of space down the flanks.   Updated at 7.51pm BST    7.49pm    3 min: Early warning sign for Wales as Rodon steps out and Zielinksi goes through. He was offside but Wayne Hennessey made a save in any case. It\u2019s started with plenty of energy.      7.47pm    1 min: And away we go in Cardiff. An early attack from Daniel James and he was looking for Gareth Bale as he scampered away. The Polish fans are making themselves heard, too. Their defence gets the ball clear.      7.45pm    A frankly unbelievable version of the Land of My Fathers, the Welsh national anthem from the fans in Cardiff. Incredible sound. You can keep your Marseillaise and the Il Canto degli Italiani, when the Welsh get proper hold of their song they are untouchable.  Updated at 7.46pm BST    7.39pm    This is a farewell to the fans ahead of the World Cup, the first since 1958 where, despite the problems of accommodation and cost, it\u2019s said there may be almost as many Welsh fans travelling to Qatar as the English. Once in a lifetime, even allowing for the glory of Euro 2016 and being at Euro 2020. The Principality Stadium is rocking with some classic EDM and the lights are flashing on and off. Cardiff is a city that does these events well, very well.      7.30pm    Alan Pugh gets in touch: \u201cBonsoir from Paris. Impossible to find a bar showing the game in Cardiff. On the plus side the Munch exhibition here was well worth a visit at the Mus\u00e9e d\u2019Orsay. And it\u2019ll certainly be a scream if we and the Scots are both in the A band for the next Nations\u2019 League while our neighbours take on Kazakhstan.\u201d     7.29pm    Rob Page speaks to S4C \u2013 in English.   It is is what it is and we\u2019ve got one game to win. We\u2019ve had four senior players out of both games. We couldn\u2019t have played Gareth on Thursday, it would have been crazy. Kieffer [Moore] had a bit of illness and took a knock that\u2019s nothing to do with team selection. It\u2019s another full house, [the fans] play their massive part.       7.13pm    Ben Fisher is our man in Cardiff tonight, and he\u2019ll be filing the full-time report later.  He\u2019s been in the Wales camp, and listening to what the likes of Rob Page and Gareth Bale have to say.  Page: \u201cWe\u2019ve got a job in hand that we\u2019re fully focused on. As soon as the final whistle has gone we\u2019ll be preparing for the World Cup.\u201d Bale: \u201cI am closer than I have been in the last few years, for sure,\u201d Bale says. \u201cIt\u2019s about playing minutes and games and I\u2019m starting to do that a lot more often now. The more I play, the fitter I\u2019ll get. Hopefully, I can start to peak and get stronger and stronger as quickly as possible.\u201d      7.05pm    For the record, Big Vinny Janssen has scored six in five for Royal Antwerp.      7.03pm    Some Premier League legends in here, not least Spurs icon Vincent Janssen, and that Belgium team features Jan Verthongen and Toby Alderweireld.        6.58pm    Denmark v France features some rather exciting players, Arsenal fans can either enthuse or look through their hands as William Saliba starts. Eduardo Camavinga and Aur\u00e9lien Tchouam\u00e9ni of Real Madrid in partnership.        6.51pm    Four Welsh changes from the team that lost to Belgium. Mepham, Ampadu, Smith and Moore out. Cabango, Morrell, Levitt and Bale in. Three Polish changes but the same back three from the loss to the Netherlands. It\u2019s Bale v Lewandowski in the battle of the captain\u2019s armbands. Per PA Media:  Skipper Gareth Bale was back in the Wales starting line-up for their Nations League relegation decider with Poland in Cardiff Bale, who was a second-half substitute in Belgium on Thursday after arriving late due to his playing commitments in the United States, was one of four changes alongside Ben Cabango, Dylan Levitt and Joe Morrell. Suspended pair Chris Mepham and Ethan Ampadu, as well as Matt Smith and Kieffer Moore, dropped out with Wales knowing only victory was enough to keep them in League A. Barcelona striker Robert Lewandowski captained a Poland side who needed to draw or win to stay in the top tier of European football.   Updated at 6.53pm BST    6.48pm   The teams - Bale starts  Wales: Hennessey; Cabango, Rodon, Norrington-Davies; C Roberts, Morrell, Levitt, N Williams; Johnson, Bale (C), James. Subs: Gunter, Colwill, Smith, Roberts, Ward, Moore, Burns, Williams, M Harris, King, Thomas, James Poland: Szczesny; Bednarek, Glik, Kiwior; Bereszynski, Krychowiak, Zurowski, Zalewski; Zielinski, Lewandowski (C), Swiderski. Subs: Skorupski, Dragowski, Gumny, Kedziora, Wieteska, Milik, Piotrowski, Grosicki, Skoras, Kaminski, Szymanski, Piatek.     6.45pm   Preamble  Thursday\u2019s defeat to Belgium, their habitual opponents, showed the size of the task that may await Rob Page in Qatar. The second-half display, which raised the hackles of Roberto Martinez so much he got himself sent off, at least suggested that all is by no means lost. These Nations League matches, competitive as they technically are, are warmups for what comes in November, but like the English the Welsh are set to be relegated from the top tier unless they beat the Poles tonight. Page\u2019s men have not won their last four matches, not ideal preparation for the World Cup but Gareth Bale is likely to be involved from the start. As for the Poles, they are readying themselves for a World Cup group involving Mexico, Saudi Arabia and Argentina, and coming off a 2-0 loss to the Netherlands on Thursday. There\u2019s some other big matches played this evening to keep you updated on, with Denmark taking on France, and the Netherlands taking on the Belgians. The Nations League: it\u2019s relentless.  "

                    "body": "Some of the UK\u2019s largest listed companies including water and energy giants have handed almost \u00a3500m to Qatari state-owned investors this year, raising concerns that blue-chip company profits are supporting the controversial World Cup host.\nThe dividend payouts are the result of the Gulf nation\u2019s investments in a raft of FTSE 100 firms, including Barclays, Shell and utility firm Severn Trent, which have reported strong profits amid a cost of living crisis and the worst UK drought in centuries.\nThe figures, compiled by the Guardian, cover funds distributed to Qatari state-owned shareholders in the 10 months leading up to the controversial tournament in November.\nHowever, the Qatari state\u2019s income from UK-listed firms is likely to have been in the billions of pounds since it won the rights to host the Fifa World Cup in 2010.\n\nThe figures will raise concerns over how everyday spending by British consumers, through bank transactions, grocery shopping and air travel, may be inadvertently supporting the Qatari host, which has criminalised homosexuality and been accused of exploiting migrant workers to build World Cup infrastructure.\nAlthough the shareholdings of listed companies are publicly available, there is little awareness about the types of investors that hold shares in UK firms.\nAmnesty International UK\u2019s director of economic affairs, Peter Frankental, said British firms needed to be more upfront about the destination of dividend payouts.\n\u201cQatar\u2019s considerable wealth and its extensive portfolio of overseas investments have been accompanied by the systematic exploitation of its vast migrant labour force, many of whom have toiled for years for abusive employers with the connivance of the Qatari authorities,\u201d Frankental said.\n\n\u201cUK companies need to be transparent about any human rights abuses that may have occurred in their investor chain, including those originating in Qatar\u2019s notorious construction sites.\u201d\nQatar\u2019s $450bn (\u00a3389bn) sovereign wealth fund, the Qatar Investment Authority (QIA), has taken a huge interest in UK-listed investment in recent decades, spending billions to acquire stakes in a raft of British blue-chip firms such as the London Stock Exchange Group and Royal Dutch Shell.\nUK stocks make up nearly a fifth of the QIA\u2019s equity portfolio at 17%, and are worth a combined $8.8bn. That makes the UK the third-largest destination for the authority\u2019s equity investments, behind Germany which makes up 29% of the portfolio at a value of $15bn, and Qatar where shares make up nearly 19% of the portfolio at $9.6bn.\nThose UK stakes have meant that the investment authority \u2013 and therefore the Qatari state \u2013 have benefited from British companies\u2019 profits, which have subsequently been handed to shareholders through buybacks and dividends.\nGuardian analysis of publicly available data shows Qatari vehicles, including QIA, have pocketed around \u00a3475m in dividends since January alone, helping support Qatari finances at a time when the state is estimated to have spent about $200bn preparing to host the World Cup.\n\nThat includes Shell, which handed nearly $17m worth of dividends to Qatar in a year when it reported record profits on the back of surging energy prices linked to the shortages caused by the war in Ukraine.\nMeanwhile, the QIA earned \u00a313m through its 4.6% holding in Coventry-based water company Severn Trent, which has come under fire for bumper executive payouts \u2013 including \u00a33.9m for its boss Liv Garfield \u2013 even though the country suffered under the worst drought conditions in centuries.\nThe QIA also earned \u00a311m from the London Stock Exchange Group, in which the QIA still holds a 7% stake, and further \u00a333m from its shareholding in supermarket chain Sainsbury\u2019s.\nThat is on top of \u00a364m from a 6.3% stake in banking giant Barclays. Its holding in the UK bank is a hangover from its controversial involvement in the bank\u2019s emergency fundraising at the height of the 2008 financial crisis. The funding arrangement helped Barclays avoid a public bailout that would have placed it under government control, but later led the Serious Fraud Office to accuse three former Barclays bankers of funnelling secret fees to Qatar in exchange for the emergency funding. A jury found those executives not guilty in early 2020. The bank itself is now appealing against a regulatory fine over the deal.\nOne of the biggest sources of UK dividend revenue came from UK-listed mining giant Glencore, which paid Qatar Holding \u2013 a subsidiary of the QIA \u2013 a total of $387m (\u00a3347m) since January. The dividends are the result of an 8% stake in the company.\nWhile Glencore is headquartered in Switzerland, rather than the UK, most UK pensions will have a stake in the FTSE 100-listed firm, which trades metals used in key technologies such as electric batteries. Glencore became one of the largest commodity companies in the world thanks to a \u00a350bn merger with mining company Xstrata, sealed thanks to late-night talks involving Tony Blair and Qatari billionaire politician Hamad bin Jassim Al Thani.\nOther dividend payouts came from stakes in Dettol disinfectant and Nurofen maker Reckitt Benckiser, which paid \u00a3382,000 to QIA, and private equity group and GKN-owner Melrose Industries, at \u00a314,000.\nThe state-owned Qatar Airways also holds a 25.23% stake in British Airways owner IAG, though the group \u2013 which is still recovering from the Covid pandemic \u2013 has not yet paid a dividend this year. \nThe QIA, Glencore, Barclays, Severn Trent, and the London Stock Exchange declined to comment. Melrose Industries did not respond to requests for comment.\nSainsbury\u2019s said in a statement that it did not choose its shareholders, and that the majority were UK pension funds and private investors including Sainsbury\u2019s staff.\nReckitt Benckiser said the company recently strengthened policies meant to prevent modern slavery and had a zero-tolerance policy on human rights abuses. \u201cWe have a track record of working throughout our supply chain to strengthen human rights and labour standards, excluding suppliers where our standards are not achieved, and working with suppliers, peers and civil society to enable change at scale.\u201d\nShell did not directly comment on the dividend payouts but shared a statement regarding its approach to separate investments in Qatar. \u201cA commitment to worker welfare and respect for people is fundamental to how companies in the Shell group operate globally, including in Qatar.\u201d\nThose dividends from listed firms are on top of valuable stakes in private British companies including Harrods, Heathrow, The Shard and Starling Bank.\nIn December engine maker Rolls-Royce announced the QIA was spending \u00a385m to take a 10% stake in a UK government-backed project to develop small nuclear power plants, known as Rolls-Royce SMR.\nQInvest, another investment vehicle of the Qatari royal family, also maintains a 43% stake in stockbroker and investment bank Panmure Gordon, which posted its first profit in three years in 2021.\nMeanwhile, Farnborough-headquartered arms company BAE Systems announced in March that it had signed an agreement to develop warship support for the Qatar Emiri\u2019s Naval Force. And amid the UK\u2019s energy crisis, Qatar\u2019s participation in the South Hook LNG terminal has come into focus. State-owned Qatar Energy has a 67.5% share in the Pembrokeshire-based terminal.\nQatar is one of the UK\u2019s largest sources of liquefied natural gas (LNG), a role that led Boris Johnson to discuss increased supply from the Gulf state in late 2021, as global gas prices soared.\n"

                    "body": "There are no winners in revenge missions. Sentiment demanded that Ghana should right the wrongs of their 2010 World Cup quarter-final against Uruguay and expiate the hurt of Luis Su\u00e1rez\u2019s last-minute handball on the line. But Uruguay, and Su\u00e1rez in particular, have no time for such romantic notions of redemption. Ghana were again eliminated after missing a penalty but they had the consolation that, although Su\u00e1rez set up two, it was South Korea and not Uruguay who went through to the last 16 with Portugal.\nUruguay did not react well. As Ghanaians sat in resigned weariness on the pitch, Uruguay\u2019s players surrounded the idiosyncratic German referee, Daniel Siebert, at the final whistle, furious they hadn\u2019t been awarded at least one of two huge penalty appeals in the second half. The Ghanaian fans, resigned by then to their exit, seemed to enjoy it all immensely. And as Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Gim\u00e9nez raged at Siebert, Su\u00e1rez wept on the bench.\n\nThis was a game haunted by the memory of events at Soccer City 12 years ago, and specifically by that one moment in the final minute of extra-time. The image was always there, a perverse footballing piet\u00e0, flitting in the peripheral vision: Stephen Appiah in the foreground having had the initial blocked effort (which was probably offside, although nobody talks about that), John Mensah and the goalkeeper Fernando Muslera falling together with Andr\u00e9s Scotti, Dominic Adiyiah stretching having headed the loose ball goalwards, Jorge Fucile with back arched and left fist thrust up having missed his attempt to handle, and Su\u00e1rez, arms out, leaping to his right to claw the ball away. It is the Pisgah of African football, the moment when it saw the promised land of a World Cup semi-final, but was denied.\n\nBillboards across Accra this week have depicted the incident with the slogan: \u201cREVENGE!: Let\u2019s support the Black Stars.\u201d The fact that Ghanaians still feel the pain of that moment was made clear by the pre-match press conference. Su\u00e1rez, with a characteristic sense of provocative showmanship, appeared alone and seemed entirely unfazed by a Ghanaian journalist saying that many in his country saw him as \u201cthe devil himself\u201d (adding \u201cel diablo\u201d, lest there be any confusion) and wanted to \u201cretire\u201d him. He didn\u2019t regret it, he said. He had been punished. He had been shown a red card and missed the semi-final as a result. It wasn\u2019t his fault Asamoah Gyan had missed the penalty.\nWas this an elaborate wind-up? Su\u00e1rez had played just 81 minutes in the group stage and had been distinctly unimpressive, managing just one shot on goal (off target). But if this was one enormous mind game Uruguay carried it to the extreme, naming Su\u00e1rez as captain. Was that in the mind of Andr\u00e9 Ayew, the only Ghana player at Al Janoub to have appeared in the 2010 quarter-final, as he stepped up to take a penalty?\nFor, of course there was penalty controversy, lots of it. How could there not be? Sergio Rochet, the Uruguay keeper, clearly tripped Mohammed Kudus but initially Andr\u00e9 Ayew was ruled offside. When VAR proved he had been played fractionally onside by the heel of Math\u00edas Olivera, the penalty award was automatic. His kick, though, was dismal and easily saved.\n\nThen, just before the hour, Darwin N\u00fa\u00f1ez went down under a challenge from Daniel Amartey. Siebert didn\u2019t give it, was told to consult the screen and, unusually, decided not to overturn the decision, signalling he had seen a slight touch on the ball. It was a decision that proved vital for Uruguay\u2019s goal difference; had that been given and converted, they would have gone through. Edinson Cavani had another decent shout in stoppage time by which point news had come through that South Korea had beaten Portugal and the game had become a frenetic slug-fest, all shape gone, just one attack after another.\nFor Ghana, who held a two-point advantage at kick-off, the moment had been there, but the moment was missed. There was a sense of inevitability to what followed. Few sides are as good as Uruguay at sensing a game\u2019s emotional pulse. As Ghana reeled, Uruguay surged. Mohammed Salisu had already cleared off the line from N\u00fa\u00f1ez when Su\u00e1rez\u2019s shot was half-blocked by Lawrence Ati-Zigi. The ball was probably spinning in anyway but Giorgian de Arrascaeta nodded over the line from close range.\n\nSix minutes later, he had his second, volleying crisply home after a clever Su\u00e1rez flick. He may be 35, the belly starting to show beneath the shirt but, though much is taken, much abides: there is magic yet in his brain and his touch, and perhaps particularly when opposition fans get the blood going.\nAnd the fury, so strangely lacking against South Korea, was back. He raged at the officials, needled away at Salisu and put his body in the way to win free-kicks before being withdrawn after 65 minutes. He had beaten them again.\nThe devil, perhaps, is never truly done but, this time, it was not quite enough. A shot of him sobbing on the big screen drew delighted jeers. Ghana had gone out \u2013 but at least they had taken the devil with them."

                    "body": "  10.01pm   Summary  Thank you for joining me tonight for a reminder of why we need more top-level international rugby league. Congratulations Australia, commiserations New Zealand. England or Samoa await the Kangaroos at Old Trafford next weekend.  Hot off the press, here\u2019s Aaron Bower\u2019s take from Elland Road. Stay tuned for more reaction during the week, as well as the countdown to the decider. I\u2019ll catch you all again soon.      9.51pm    England and Samoa now know what\u2019s ahead of them if they come through their assignment at Arsenal\u2019s Emirates Stadium tomorrow.        9.46pm    Despite the superb tries and New Zealand\u2019s dynamic forward play in the first half, the result hinged on one moment midway through the second when Cameron Murray took advantage of a brief lapse in concentration. An exhausted Brandon Smith was the culprit, conceding a penalty for finding himself on the wrong side of the ruck, then failing to adapt to the danger of Murray steaming into the line from the quick play. Nelson Asofa-Solomona should have done better in contact as well, and it\u2019s those fine margins that determine world cup campaigns.  Updated at 9.54pm GMT    9.41pm    \u201cI certainly know we can play better,\u201d adds Meninga, \u201cbut New Zealand didn\u2019t let us.\u201d The Australian coach is confident he will have a fully fit squad to select from for next weekend\u2019s final against England or Samoa.      9.39pm    \u201cFantastic. That was Test match rugby. New Zealand threw everything but the kitchen sink at us,\u201d says Mal Meninga. \u201cI\u2019m just glad we\u2019re on the winning side. \u201cIt\u2019s right up there. It was a great challenge for both sides and it was a great advertisement for the game.\u201d  Updated at 9.54pm GMT    9.38pm         9.37pm   Liam Martin player of the match  Australian enforcer Liam Martin is named player of the match for his massive hits and hard running. \u201cAbsolutely buggered,\u201d he grins between pants as he accepts his award.   Updated at 10.01pm GMT    9.34pm    That was a superb demonstration of international rugby league. A ding-dong first-half full of breathtaking tries gave way to an exhausting second period decided by a solitary score the result of fatigue and errors.     9.32pm   Full-time: Australia 16-14 New Zealand  The Kangaroos survive a tough test to make it through to the rugby league world cup final.    Updated at 9.45pm GMT    9.31pm    79 mins: The drive takes New Zealand to 40m out on tackle three. Hughes and Brown try to unpick the lock on tackle four but the defence is too good. It\u2019s all about the kick on the last, by Hughes, from left to right corner\u2026 and Mitchell leaps with timing to defuse the bomb and secure a place in the world cup final.      9.30pm    78 mins: New Zealand make little ground before Hughes is forced to kick. Australia take no risks with runners from dummy-half or first receiver until the last. But then everything goes wrong with Cleary\u2019s kick off cue then Holmes\u2019 second effort belted way beyond the in-goal. Can the Kiwis score from 80m out?      9.28pm    77 mins: Australia make good ground on the set. Mitchell is busy, Crichton industrious, and Cleary accepts some punishment with a dive towards the line on the last tackle. Smart rugby league from the Kangaroos. The Kiwis only have a couple of sets remaining to force a late upset and they begin 100m away from glory.      9.27pm    76 mins: The Kangaroos defend well early in the set, slowing down the ruck and sucking out any momentum. Brown tries to spark some life back into the drive but he is crunched heading to the gainline. By the time Hughes kicks, Addo-Carr can accept possession unopposed. Time running out for the Kiwis.  Updated at 9.56pm GMT    9.25pm    75 mins: The Kiwis have the bit between their teeth and smash into their next defensive set, restricting Australia to a Cleary kick 35m from his own line.      9.24pm    73 mins: What a passage of play! Cleary kicks long but Nicoll-Klokstad returns with interest, busting through tackles and almost running over the top of Tedesco. The ruck is speedy and Hughes senses the opportunity, trying to exploit the space behind Addo-Carr on the right wing. He dabs the ball onto his boot, the Fox covers but Hiku leaps over the top to touch down in the corner! Ashley Klein isn\u2019t convinced it\u2019s a try, and the TMO agrees, Hiku\u2019s foot was out of touch before his Superman leap. Daring and brave from New Zealand but Australia survive.   Updated at 9.47pm GMT    9.22pm    72 mins: Finally a New Zealand attack! A set restart on halfway is the impetus, prompting more of the offloading we saw to good effect in the first half. Australia are solid in defence though with Mitchell first hammering a momentum-changing tackle then leaping to claim the testing high crossfield kick. The Kangaroos only make 25m in response, can the Kiwis capitalise?      9.20pm    71 mins: Australia build through the middle with Cleary and Trbojevic both running to the line with purpose. New Zealand are increasingly ragged in defence but benefit from a Tedesco slip just as the door was being prised open.  Updated at 10.02pm GMT    9.18pm    69 mins: After a long Hughes kick Tedesco has space to return to his side\u2019s 40m line and set up another Australian incursion. The Kangaroos are very smartly turning the screw now. Cleary again goes to the skies on the last and despite Hiku doing superbly with the contested mark it leaves 100m to travel for the sixth or seventh set in a row.  Updated at 10.02pm GMT    9.17pm    67 mins: Another New Zealand error \u2013 this time off Hughes\u2019s boot \u2013 and Addo-Carr almost dashes down the left wing on the counterattack until he\u2019s ankle tapped 20m out. The Kangaroos hold the ball in for a set and are happy for a kick chase on the last tackle to force Rapana to dash fractionally beyond his in-goal. The Kiwis are on the ropes.      9.14pm     There have been a few dubious tackles tonight, Tino\u2019s the latest.      9.13pm    65 mins: Hmmm, are the Kiwis running out of steam? Another handling error, this time from Rapana, turns the ball over just 30m from his own line. Australia go through hands to the right but Munster is wrapped up before he can find Wighton outside. Crichton is the unlikely kicker in the set but he dribbles a neat grubber that Mulitalo takes a few blades of grass in front of the line.      9.11pm    64 mins: New Zealand clear their lines and settle after a spell of pressure, but not without Fisher-Harris taking a massive hit from Martin, who is playing like a guided missile this half.      9.10pm    62 mins: Australia are in prime field position and the Kangaroos look set to turn the screw. Grant almost shimmys through from dummy-half before Cleary\u2019s high ball is recycled Australia\u2019s way. Munster instigates a raid from broken play and the ground opens up for the green jerseys\u2026 but there\u2019s a whistle. With a try at their mercy the Kangaroos concede a penalty courtesy of a needless shove from Mitchell off the ball.      9.07pm    60 mins: It\u2019s loose carry o\u2019clock! After Manu comes Wighton and now Asofa-Solomona. It\u2019s no surprise considering the intensity of the contest, and the latter could perhaps have been overturned by the referee with Martin executing the hit with minimal use of the arms.      9.06pm    58 mins: Asofa-Solomona and Smith were both at fault for that try and the latter looks either injured or exhausted as the Kiwis try to regroup. Maguire needs to use his bench smartly. The urgency grows when Manu is drilled by Australian substitute Fa\u2019asuamaleaui and loses possession.      9.04pm   TRY! Australia 16-14 New Zealand (Murray, 54)  A ruck penalty to the Kangaroos deep in defence could be that spark. A long clearing kick sets up perfect field position, augmented by a set restart. Grant and Munster combine to free Tedesco, then Cleary almost shepherds Yeo under the posts. New Zealand hold on \u2013 but illegally so with Smith lying on the wrong side of the ruck \u2013 and Australia have a penalty under the posts.  AND THEY SCORE PRACTICALLY UNOPPOSED! Murray gathers the tap pass then barrels straight at the Kiwi line, the tackles are limp and he pounds over like a competitive father in a lads v dads knockabout. Awful defence from New Zealand and Murray takes full advantage.  Cleary cannot miss from under the bar and out of nowhere Australia are ahead.   Updated at 10.06pm GMT    8.59pm    51 mins: Another brilliant Brown bomb invites Addo-Carr to mark and accept a mighty hit from Hiku. Excellent rugby league from all three involved.  Australia have no go-forward and barely reach halfway before a simple kick reception for Nicoll-Klokstad. The Kangaroos need a spark from somewhere and they have only half an hour to find it.  Updated at 10.05pm GMT    8.57pm    49 mins: New Zealand reach 20m at a cruise and then keep the ball alive like Fiji Sevens stars on the left, forcing Australia to scramble defence at pace. Hughes then almost breaks the line through the middle, and on the last nearly feeds his outside runners through on the right. The Kiwis are not overawed by the occasion and their halves have performed superbly with ball in hand.  Updated at 10.07pm GMT    8.55pm    47 mins: And now some biff! Australia go down the other end, Cleary makes a dart but he\u2019s tackled superbly by Papali\u2019i \u2013 who earns the loose carry in the process. The big Kiwi stands over the prone halfback to confirm his dominance, so Murray steams in and shoves him out of the way, sparking an all-in with handbags flying. It proves to be more posturing than pugilistic but New Zealand are awarded a clearing penalty.   Updated at 10.08pm GMT    8.53pm    45 mins: The Kiwis grind to halfway with little penetration but Brown\u2019s kicking has been so dangerous all night they remain a threat. Another boot from the five-eighth causes panic in the Australian defence after Addo-Carr lets the ball bounce. New Zealand capitalise on broken play, Leota does superbly, and Hiku scores a stunning try against the run of play! Hang on\u2026 the TMO has ruled Hiku was fractionally offside when Brown kicked and the try will not stand. Ooof, that was tough.  Updated at 8.57pm GMT    8.49pm    44 mins: Australia get lucky when Brown hammers Murray and dislodges the ball, but isn\u2019t rewarded by the referee. The Kangaroos profit further with a set restart as the drive reaches the 20m line. Something is brewing \u2013 until Murray again loses the ball and this time he is penalised! Huge let-off for New Zealand in the shadow of their posts.      8.47pm    42 mins: Nothing flash from the Kangaroos on their opening set with the Kiwi defence again hitting hard and getting bodies over the ball to slow the ruck down. New Zealand make little ground in reply.     8.44pm    The teams are back out for the second half. Can the Kiwis finish the job?     8.43pm         8.42pm    Analysis on Australian TV from Cooper Cronk and Bryan Fletcher is pretty straightforward: New Zealand are getting quick ruck ball, Australia aren\u2019t. For the Kiwis it\u2019s all about their ability to offload to keep play moving, while the Kangaroos are unable to clear out the second and third tacklers slowing the play down. Fletcher suggests the referee could do more to keep the game ticking over, in scenes reminiscent of NSW criticisms of Klein during the Origin series.  Updated at 10.09pm GMT    8.36pm    If you haven\u2019t seen it yet, enjoy Josh Addo-Carr\u2019s outrageous try.      8.31pm   Half-time: Australia 10-14 New Zealand  Superb half of international rugby league and it ends with New Zealand taking a deserved lead. The Kiwis have earned the right to play with a strong showing from their pack. The halfback pairing of Hughes and Brown have been outstanding. What can the Kangaroos bring after the break?  Updated at 8.33pm GMT    8.29pm   TRY! Australia 10-14 New Zealand (Brown, 37)  Dylan Brown accepts the four points but New Zealand\u2019s try out of nowhere is all Ronaldo Mulitalo. The Kiwis do the hard yards through the middle with Asofa-Solomona to the fore. Then, when they go through hands to the left, Mulitalo has a couple of yards to run into and he uses them to step outside his direct opponent and accelerate down the touchline. He needs a support runner on his inside \u2013 and he finds Brown with an excellent pass under pressure. Brown adds to his impressive night with the simple finish.   Rapana makes it three from three with his boot.  Updated at 9.10pm GMT    8.26pm    36 mins: A long passage of workmanlike rugby league between the two 20m lines with fatigue starting to show at the end of a pulsating half. Manu does brilliantly at fullback to pouch Cleary\u2019s enormous spiralling long-range bomb.      8.24pm    34 mins: Back to the midfield arm-wrestle, a duel notable for New Zealand\u2019s offloading. The Kiwis are doing well keeping the ball alive after contact, even when the likes of Wighton nail some bone-crunching hits. Valentine Holmes is again vital in defence under Brown\u2019s kick.      8.22pm   TRY! Australia 10-8 New Zealand (Holmes, 29)  Australia need a burst to get out of trouble and they find it when Wighton and Martin combine on the right to create space on halfway. The Kangaroos smell blood and the pace of the drive goes up a number of gears. Cleary and Tedesco both fancy their luck infield, Munster almost wriggles through a gap, then with New Zealand unsettled the ball goes through hands to the right where Wighton times his side-step to perfection to wrong-foot the oncoming tackler and skip towards the line. He\u2019s brought down within inches by Manu, but the Kiwi falls off, allowing Wighton to offload brilliantly on the ground to Holmes to dab the ball down in the right corner. Decisive from Australia, excellent improvisation from Wighton. Cleary drags his touchline conversion across the face of the posts.    Updated at 10.12pm GMT    8.18pm    27 mins: Solid restart set from the Kiwis and another testing kick from Brown asks questions of Holmes. The Australian winger is up to the task but he has to accept a massive hit from Papali\u2019i for his troubles. The Kangaroos make little use of the ball as New Zealand re-establish their control in midfield. This has been nip-and-tuck all night so far with subtle shifts in ascendancy among the forwards determining field position.      8.14pm   PENALTY! Australia 6-8 New Zealand (Rapana, 25)  Rapana is not a regular goalkicker at club level and his technique does not look the most secure, but he stabs over two points to put the Kiwis back in front.   Updated at 8.27pm GMT    8.13pm    23 mins: Hughes\u2019 fingerprints are all over everything New Zealand are doing tonight. After a couple of forward hit-ups he heads left and Nicoll-Klokstad almost wriggles enough space to invite his left winger to overlap and score. The Storm No 7 then heads to the gainline and dabs ahead forcing Tedesco to gather under pressure, and the Australian skipper does just that \u2013 and then runs into his own man for an accidental offside. The Kiwis accept the shot for goal.  Updated at 10.13pm GMT    8.11pm    20 mins: Australia have evened the contest in midfield and Tedesco has started to get busy in the line. Munster has been scrappy early, limiting the fluency with ball in hand, perhaps still coming to grips with his partnership with Cleary?  Elland Road has quietened a smidge, drawing breath following that extraordinary try from Addo-Carr. The Fox, by the way, has just spilled the ball in contact on the left inside his own half, allowing New Zealand their first decent attacking platform for a while.      8.07pm   TRY! Australia 6-6 New Zealand (Addo-Carr, 16)  ONE OF THE GREAT RUGBY LEAGUE TRIES! Australia were treading water on halfway when Hunt drifted towards the centre spot from right to left and unleashed a mighty bomb towards the left corner. It looked tactical until, like a cartoonish blur, Josh Addo-Carr is glimpsed haring down the left touchline and pouches a perfect mark on the run in time to turn his momentum into a dive over the line. That was extraordinary. The precision, the timing, the speed, the coordination. A brilliant moment worthy of any major event. Cleary begins his night off the tee with a steadying conversion from the touchline.    Updated at 8.25pm GMT    8.03pm    14 mins: Again New Zealand attack dangerously on the back of an Australian error, this time a needless attempted strip with three green jerseys committed to the tackle. The Kiwis turn try-line defence into attack but this time the Kangaroo defence is up to the high ball     8.02pm   TRY! Australia 0-6 New Zealand (Hughes, 11)  Australia again make little ground and New Zealand eat up the metres with the help of a set restart. Papali\u2019i sets up play on tackle five on the left wing, playing the ball without any shorts. Brown accepts the pass at first receiver and has a perfect angle to kick high crossfield for his chasers to compete overhead. The weighting is perfect, the pack forms, Manu climbs highest, Hughes is at his feet ready to accept the pat down and flop over the line for the opening try. Superbly executed from the Kiwis and reward for an enterprising start.  Rapana, with blood streaming from behind his left ear, chips over the simple conversion.  Updated at 8.08pm GMT    7.57pm    10 mins: Hunt immediately redeems himself, making a desperate try-line intervention to gather Smith\u2019s chip and chase knowing he was going to get poleaxed in the process. That was a big moment with the Kiwis probing and prepared to gamble early in the set.      7.56pm    8 mins: Two sets in a row the Kagnaroos make little ground coming out of their own defensive end. The latter ending with a huge miscue from Ben Hunt trying to kick a 40-20 from dummy-half, succeeding only in walloping a massive boot miles out on the full. New Zealand have asserted themselves well up front early on.     7.54pm    6 mins: The Kiwis have come to play tonight. After a couple of tackles they go through hands to the left and Mulitalo can pin his ears back on the outside until he\u2019s scragged just inside Australia\u2019s half. The ball remains alive and New Zealand continue to press as play feeds to the right but another frenetic, unplanned play on the last tackle lets Australia off the hook.      7.52pm    4 mins: Australia get to work in A1 attacking territory. Cleary and Mitchell combine well on the left edge, Tedesco almost wriggles through in the middle, but the Kiwis defend securely. Cleary drops a perfect high kick to the left corner but New Zealand deal with that threat as well. Michael Maguire will be pleased with his side\u2019s defence early.      7.51pm    2 mins: New Zealand accept Tedesco\u2019s kick and the Kiwis drive to halfway before Hughes dummies to kick on the last, dashes an extra 20m but the subsequent kick from Rapana isn\u2019t threatening. Still, a nice indication of Hughes\u2019 intent tonight. Going the other way the Kangaroos are secure with their set and have a sniff when Cleary\u2019s bomb is allowed to bounce and cause a scramble 20m out. The Kiwis don\u2019t settle and from their second drive of the night Munster strips Hiku and prompts a loose carry in dangerous territory.   Updated at 8.13pm GMT    7.47pm   Kick-off  Here we go, the biggest clash in international rugby league is underway. Who will reach the world cup final?  Updated at 8.12pm GMT    7.46pm    New Zealand march upon Australia during their pre-match haka. It ends with clubmates Harry Grant and Brandon Smith embracing.   I\u2019m not embarrassed to say if Nelson Asofa-Solomona came at me like that I would soil myself and run very fast towards the Pennines.  Updated at 8.12pm GMT    7.41pm    Your referee tonight is Ashley Klein, the Australian who has handled the biggest matches in the southern hemisphere all season.      7.40pm    The good news is it\u2019s cool and dry in West Yorkshire. There is a bit of a southerly wind but it should not impose itself on proceedings.      7.38pm    The two squads are out on the Elland Road turf, Australia in green and gold, New Zealand in black and white.  As it is November 11, the two coaches have laid wreaths commemorating remembrance day and the ground observes a minute\u2019s silence before the anthems.      7.36pm         7.36pm    World Cup tours sound glamorous, but the reality is weeks on end in hotels in cities you\u2019d probably choose not to visit, as Gavin Willacy writes.  Guests exiting the lifts on the first floor of a rather smart hotel in Liverpool city centre last week would have got a shock if they turned left in search of the breakfast room rather than right. They would have walked in on NRL superstar Nathan Brown, clad only in his underpants, getting a massage. Welcome to life in camp at a World Cup: humdrum fare one way, international fame the next.       7.29pm    Mal Meninga\u2019s halfback conundrum has proven a headache all tournament, but there are worse problems than tossing up between the two starting Origin sevens. John Davidson has more.  To Cleary or not to Cleary, that is the question that has been keeping Meninga from getting his eight hours every night these past three weeks. It\u2019s a classic case of young vs old, newcomer vs veteran, New South Welshman vs Queenslander, even brunette vs blond, if you like. On the one hand is Cleary, 24, the Penrith Panther who led his team to three NRL grand finals in the past three years, winning two of them, and to some the best player on the planet. And on the other is \u2018DCE\u2019 \u2013 33, an NRL grand final winner in 2011 and a Clive Churchill medal winner playing in his second World Cup. And who led Queensland to a State of Origin series over Cleary\u2019s Blues earlier this year and has an already established partnership with Cam Munster, it must be noted.       7.27pm         7.26pm   New Zealand XVII  Michael Maguire has made one change with Briton Nikora coming in for Kenny Bromwich. Jared Waerea-Hargreaves continues to miss out with a hamstring injury but it remains a formidable line-up with its core of Melbourne Storm stalwarts. 1. Joseph Manu2. Ronaldo Mulitalo4. Peta Hiku21.

Hunt\u2019s versatility spells bad news for State of Origin teammate Daly Cherry-Evans. The selection dilemma at halfback appears to have been resolved in favour of Nathan Cleary with the NSW No 7 awarded playmaking duties alongside Cameron Munster.  1. James Tedesco4.

Harry Grant      7.17pm    Aaron Bower sets the scene from West Yorkshire as rugby league\u2019s international heavyweights prepare for battle.  It is arguably the most mouthwatering semi-final in Rugby League World Cup history, and the coaches of Australia and New Zealand both believe they have the quality to book their place in next weekend\u2019s final with victory at Elland Road on Friday night.       7.04pm   Preamble  Hello everybody and welcome to live coverage of the first semi-final of the 2021 Rugby League World Cup. Australia vs New Zealand kicks off at Elland Road, Leeds at 7:45pm GMT (6:45am AEDT). There may be two more matches remaining in this year\u2019s tournament but this is surely the world cup\u2019s high watermark. Australia, winner of eight of nine Paul Barri\u00e8re trophies since 1975, against New Zealand, the only team to deny them in a title decider during this ascendancy. If Mal Meninga\u2019s all-powerful outfit are to be denied a third straight crown, it seems likely their near neighbours in black are the only mob that can stop them. The Kangaroos naturally start as favourites, but it is the Kiwis who begin as the number one ranked side in international rugby league. Australia have cruised to this point without being challenged. Fiji made them work for ten or so minutes early in their opening match, since when it\u2019s been exhibition stuff with records strewn in their slipstream. That isn\u2019t to say the Kangaroos have hit top form. Performances have been mixed, with the quarter-final victory over Lebanon arriving to much criticism at home. This has focussed predominantly on the cohesion among the playmakers with Meninga trying desperately to shoehorn State of Origin halfbacks Nathan Cleary and Daly Cherry-Evans into the same 17, along with a surfeit of NRL fullbacks. New Zealand haven\u2019t had such an easy time of it. The Cedars kept them honest in the group phase and Fiji gave them an almighty scare in the quarter-final. But this rivalry usually brings out the best in the Kiwis and they can be trusted to raise their game. In the past five meetings between the pair the ledger favours Australia only three to two. This should be a belter. I\u2019ll be back shortly with the line-ups. Remember, you can contribute throughout the match by sending me an email or directing any tweets to @JPHowcroft.   "

                    "body": "  5.35pm    And that\u2019s about it for today. Thanks for reading. Let\u2019s sign off with this Louise Taylor piece on October\u2019s Premier League Player of the Month, Miguel Almir\u00f3n.      5.28pm    All the weekend Premier League team news in one place including injuries, suspensions, disciplinary records, form and even top goalgetters. West Ham\u2019s joint-top scorers have managed just two goals apiece. Chelsea\u2019s leading marksmen have just three each.      5.20pm    The World Cup in Qatar: are you watching or boycotting? If you have decided against travelling or are switching off at home, we want to hear from you\u2026      5.11pm    Brentford take on Manchester City at the Etihad in Saturday\u2019s early game and Bees boss Thomas Frank has been talking about the hosts, giving particular focus to Erling Haaland and Kevin De Bruyne. \u201cIs it going to be difficult? It\u2019ll be unbelievably difficult. They have an almost complete squad and added Haaland who will be destroying goal records in the coming years. A lot has been said about him - he is a machine. They are an unbelievably difficult side to close down, but I back us to do something. We have never, ever gone into a game believing that we\u2019re not capable of winning. It\u2019s most likely the biggest challenge and we\u2019re looking forward to it.\u201d He added: \u201c(Haaland) is playing for a team that is giving him probably the best possibilities to score goals; they will provide him with good opportunities from crosses or slide passes. It\u2019s about trying to stop the source; the more we can stop the source, the better. It will not be the first time that people have tried to keep De Bruyne quiet. He always seems to find a way.\u201d A few Opta stats to make Frank feel worse. Then again, it\u2019s not certain Haaland will play.  Manchester City have won each of their last 11 Premier League home games, their longest such run since a run of 14 in the 2017-18 campaign. They\u2019ve scored at least twice in their last 15 at the Etihad. As well as being the top scorer in the Premier League this season, Erling Haaland\u2019s goals have been worth a league-high 13 points to Manchester City. It\u2019s the most points won by a Man City player in a single Premier League campaign since 2016-17 (Sergio Ag\u00fcero, 13).      5.00pm    It\u2019s 5pm, so a good time for this\u2026      4.53pm    Welcome to the future. Let Arsene Wenger explain how it will unfold\u2026 via Reuters.  FIFA will share in-depth match data, graphics and video from every World Cup match in Qatar with all participating teams as well as supporters and media through a new performance analysis service announced on Friday. The service, led by FIFA\u2019s chief of global football development Arsene Wenger and developed by the world governing body\u2019s High Performance team, will offer insight on 11 metrics including expected goals, possession control and phases of play. \u201cEvery match will have its own unique set of in-match and post-match enhanced football intelligence visuals presented as augmented reality and traditional graphics,\u201d FIFA said. \u201cThese new statistics break down each area of the game into fine detail and provide operational definitions and multiple video examples to clearly define each action.\u201d FIFA has also set up a specialist coaching website to provide detailed video explanations on each metric. Former Arsenal manager Wenger said making the data readily available aimed to \u201chelp everyone to better understand the game\u201d. He added: \u201cEnhanced football intelligence will be our blueprint for how we analyse football in the future. We would like to share our vision of using football data analytics combined with technical expert interpretation to create a new football intelligence. My team will continue to provide new and insightful football analysis content to help share new understanding of the game combined with performance data, video examples and technical explanations.\u201d     4.43pm    While we\u2019re on Argentina, let\u2019s go back to 1978. Lots of ticker tape and a classic \u201cKempes\u2026 1-0\u201d from David Coleman. I\u2019ve always loved that first Argentina goal. So quick and slick from Luque and Kempes after Ardilles drives forward.      4.35pm   Argentina name World Cup squad  Next up in squad naming news\u2026 it\u2019s Argentina. Injured forward Paulo Dybala made the cut as Argentina coach Lionel Scaloni named his 26-man squad on Friday. Dybala has not played for his club AS Roma since early October but Argentina hope he regains fitness before their World Cup campaign begins on 22 November against Group C opponents Saudi Arabia. \u201cThey are proud to be called up and wear this jersey, let\u2019s hope that you as fans are too. All together,\u201d Scaloni said in an Instagram video. Argentina will be without services of Giovani Lo Celso, however, after the midfielder picked up a hamstring injurylast month while playing for Villarreal, with Scaloni saying he was \u2018irreplaceable\u2019. Manchester City forward Julian Alvarez, 22, was named in the squad after a stellar year where he scored 18 goals while on loan at Argentine club River Plate before netting seven times in all competitions for City. Inter Milan forward Lautaro Martinez, who scored 25 goals last season and has begun this campaign with eight in all competitions, is expected to lead the line. Argentina also play Mexico and Poland in Group C. Goalkeepers: Emiliano Martinez (Aston Villa), Franco Armani (River Plate) and Geronimo Rulli (Villarreal)Defenders: Gonzalo Montiel (Sevilla), Nahuel Molina (Atletico Madrid), German Pezzella (Real Betis), Cristian Romero (Tottenham Hotspur), Nicolas Otamendi (Benfica), Lisandro Martinez (Manchester United), Juan Foyth (Villarreal), Nicolas Tagliafico (Olympique Lyonnais), Marcos Acuna (Sevilla)Midfielders: Leandro Paredes (Juventus), Guido Rodriguez (Real Betis), Enzo Fernandez (Benfica), Rodrigo De Paul (Atletico Madrid), Exequiel Palacios (Bayer Leverkusen), Alejandro Gomez (Sevilla), Alexis Mac Allister (Brighton &amp; Hove Albion)Forwards: Paulo Dybala (AS Roma), Lionel Messi (Paris St Germain), Angel Di Maria (Juventus), Nicolas Gonzalez (Fiorentina), Joaquin Correa (Inter Milan), Lautaro Martinez (Inter Milan), Julian Alvarez (Manchester City).     4.20pm    Leeds boss Jesse Marsch says his side have no fear of playing the Premier League big boys ahead of Saturday\u2019s visit to Tottenham. Fair point. His side have beaten Liverpool and Chelsea already this season and missed a penalty in a narrow 1-0 defeat to leaders Arsenal. Here\u2019s the American talking about that trip to Spurs. \u201cWe know this is a big challenge once again against a top opponent in our league that is disciplined to play the way they do. But the beauty of where we are is that we are not perfect but we are not afraid, we have shown this year that we are not afraid of big opponents. We are going to go down and play confidently and go after the game in every way. \u201cWe have been talking internally about being winners, that in a lot of these matches we are right in it. The way the games have gone it is often very even and we have to be more poised to capitalise on those situations and stay strong and stable. In both of those matches we were able to capitalise and it looked like we were going to win.\u201d On the team news front, Adam Forshaw, Stuart Dallas, Patrick Bamford and Mateusz Klich are all out while Jack Harrison is doubtful due to a muscle strain.     4.11pm   Conte in no rush for Tottenham contract talks  Tottenham manager Antonio Conte will meet with chairman Daniel Levy and sporting director Fabio Paratici during the upcoming domestic football break but insists discussions over his own contract will not be on the agenda. Spurs host Leeds in the Premier League on Saturday before the focus turns to the World Cup, with all domestic leagues around the globe on pause while the tournament in Qatar takes place. Given the unusual lengthy period without fixtures, it has regularly been put to Conte that it could be the perfect time to discuss a new deal with his current terms set to expire in June, although the club do hold the option to extend his contract by a further 12 months, the PA news agency understands. The Italian rejected any need to urgently discuss his terms but did admit the January transfer window will be a key topic of discussion with the hierarchy.  Last week Conte celebrated a year at Tottenham and in a strange twist of fate he will again take on Leeds at home this weekend. The same fixture marked the beginning of the ex-Chelsea manager\u2019s era at Spurs but while he is more than happy to wait before opening talks over any potential new contract, he wants to deserve fresh terms.\u201cYou know very well that my contract expires on June 30. I think until that moment the club has to make the best evaluation,\u201d Conte added. \u201cI think everything (you get,) you need to deserve. For this reason it\u2019ll be important to see the rest of the season what happens and if we\u2019re happy with the improvement we\u2019re making, but every situation, it\u2019s important to deserve. \u201cIn my opinion on my side, it\u2019s important for me professionally I have to feel I deserve to have a new contract and to sign a new contract with this club. I have to feel this. But for sure we\u2019ll talk with the club and we\u2019ll find the best solution.\u201d Conte pointed out his conversations with Paratici and Levy during the past 12 months have always been \u201cgood\u201d but knows they must continue to be honest about where Spurs are in their project to become a genuine title contender. He insisted: \u201cFor sure, every time we speak together they\u2019re always good conversations, because there is only one target to try to improve, to improve the club in every aspect. On and outside the pitch. Then to find the best solution in every moment. I think until now we worked only with this target to improve. To improve and to find a good way to bring this club to be competitive, but I\u2019m understanding very well this year that it\u2019s not easy.\u201d (PA Media)     4.00pm    Staying with Senegal, here\u2019s a flashback to the opening game of the 2002 World Cup. Liverpool looked like they\u2019d signed a real star in El Hadji Douf. That didn\u2019t quite work out (six goals in 79 games and dissing Steven Gerrard quite a lot). Senegal play the Netherlands in the second game of the 2022 World Cup on 21 November.       3.52pm    A chat with QPR goalkeeper Seny Dieng, who is heading off to the World Cup with Senegal. \u201cEver since I was young I\u2019ve wanted to play for Senegal,\u201d says Dieng, born in Switzerland to a Senegalese father and Swiss mother. \u201cI watched Senegal going through to the quarters at the World Cup in 2002 and I knew I wanted to be at that level. The first thing is to come out of the group at the World Cup and then I think there is no limit to where we can get.\u201d      3.43pm    The major moral dilemma represented by attending a World Cup in Qatar. This is well worth a read. \u201cIt\u2019s a World Cup and England are there so we will go out, but wearing as much rainbow gear as we possibly can so we can do our piece to represent England and progress in the world.\u201d      3.35pm   Guardiola will assess Haaland fitness after training  Pep Guardiola has been speaking and this will be of interest to both fantasy managers and actual England manager Gareth Southgate. The Manchester City boss has given updates on three of his squad: Erling Haaland, who isn\u2019t going to the World Cup, and England duo Kyle Walker and Kalvin Phillips, who are. This from the Manchester City website: Pep Guardiola will use Friday afternoon\u2019s training session to assess the latest fitness of Erling Haaland. The Norwegian has been used sparingly since picking up a foot injury against Borussia Dortmund in October. He missed the games against Leicester City and Sevilla, and only appeared midway through the second-half of the 2-1 win over Fulham last weekend, scoring a dramatic late winner from the spot. An unused substitute against Chelsea in midweek, Guardiola says he will wait and see how his top scorer feels before planning the team for Brentford. Asked if Haaland would play against the Bees, the boss said: \u201cWe will see. After today\u2019s training, we will see.\u201d Then, asked if Haaland was better, Pep added: \u201cA little bit.\u201d Kalvin Phillips and Kyle Walker were included in England\u2019s 26-man squad for the World Cup on Thursday and Guardiola was asked for his thoughts on their selection \u2013 particularly as Walker is yet to start training after his September surgery. Phillips made an impressive cameo against Chelsea on Wednesday evening, but Walker is still to return to full training. \u201cKalvin you saw in the last game,\u201d he said. \u201cHe is ready \u2013 Kyle, not yet. It\u2019s a decision for Kyle and Southgate (the decision to select him) - 100% their decision. I am not involved. After Saturday, the players belong to the national teams. I am not worried.\u201d     3.26pm    The unique circumstances of the Qatar World Cup have created an unprecedented risk of injury during the tournament, the international players\u2019 union, Fifpro, has warned. Paul MacInnes highlights yet another reason why the 2022 edition is fraught with problems.       3.18pm    If it seems like the managerial merry go-round has been spinning fast this season, that\u2019s because it\u2019s true. Clubs in the Premier League and English Football League (EFL) have broken the record for most manager departures within the first 15 weeks of a season, PA analysis shows. Thursday\u2019s sacking of Leam Richardson by Wigan took this season\u2019s tally of permanent managerial changes to 26, with the campaign having started just 105 days ago on July 29. This is a new record for the Premier League era, surpassing the previous mark that was set initially in 2001-02, before being equalled in 2007-08 and 2014-15. Richardson was the third head coach to leave his post this week, with his departure coming immediately after Nathan Jones had left Luton to take up the manager\u2019s job at Southampton, which had in turn been vacated by Ralph Hasenhuttl\u2019s dismissal on Monday. Rochdale\u2019s sacking of Robbie Stockdale opened the floodgates all the way back on August 18, just 20 days into the season. There were just 14 manager changes by this point last year, the lowest for eight seasons and around half as many as in 2022-23. Five of those were in the Premier League - Xisco Munoz (Watford), Steve Bruce (Newcastle), Nuno Espirito Santo (Tottenham), Daniel Farke (Norwich) and Dean Smith (Aston Villa) - but the remaining 72 EFL clubs had seen only nine departures between them.     3.09pm    The excellent Tim Key stays topical with a World Cup squad announcement poem.      2.57pm    With five Premier League wins and a draw in October, Newcastle were always likely to sweep the monthly awards. Opta add some further perspective on their rise ahead of Saturday\u2019s home game against Chelsea.  Newcastle are playing a Premier League game starting the day in the top three for the first time since November 2011, losing 3-1 at league-leaders Manchester City. This is the first time they\u2019re facing Chelsea while above them in the table since May 2012, and a 2-0 victory at Stamford Bridge.        2.49pm    Thanks Gregg. All our World Cup team guides can be found here by the way. Each profile contains a \u2018Qatar stance\u2019 section and the Dutch KNVB has been one of the few football associations to criticise human rights and working conditions in the country. Netherlands coach Louis van Gaal gave a further update when announcing his 26-man squad on Friday. This from Reuters:  The Netherlands will take time during their stay in Qatar to talk to migrants who helped build the stadiums for the World Cup, van Gaal said on Friday. The team will meet a group of about 20 migrants on November 17 to talk about their working conditions and to give them the opportunity to join the players in training. Last year, Qatar\u2019s government denied claims in a report by human rights organisation Amnesty International that thousands of migrant workers were being trapped and exploited. Van Gaal said the meeting with the migrants was meant to give attention to the often dire conditions under which stadiums and other infrastructure for the tournament were built before the team\u2019s focus totally shifts to the World Cup itself. \u201cIt will of course be a somewhat manufactured situation, but the fact we are willing to do this tells you something about the ideas of the KNVB and of this squad,\u201d Van Gaal said of the meeting. Van Gaal earlier this year said he felt it was ridiculous that the World Cup was being played in Qatar, as he accused world soccer\u2019s governing body FIFA of taking the tournament to the Middle East emirate for money and commercial reasons.     2.35pm    With it being a weekend of Copa del Rey games in Spain, La Liga has already packed up for the World Cup. Here\u2019s Sid Lowe on the state of play as it goes on hiatus for 50 days:  And with that, I\u2019ll hand back to Dave.  Updated at 2.38pm GMT    2.31pm    Graham Potter\u2019s Chelsea take on high-flying Newcastle at St James\u2019 Park tomorrow and they\u2019re struggling a bit, aren\u2019t they? They haven\u2019t won in four league games and Potter was asked whether he is worried about recent performances:  We played Milan in-between Wolves, Reece [James] got injured - a key player - so lacked stability in solution, Wesley [Fofana] as well. Then a blow to NG [N\u2019Golo Kante]. We\u2019ve performed well against Salzburg, got a good result. Suffered first 20 against Brighton, and that\u2019s knocked us back a little bit. I think there is more to come from the team we have and the group we have. We\u2019ve had some key players out: Kant\u00e9, [Ben] Chilwell, James, Fofana. They are key players and a couple of them are replacing key ones who left in the summer. Our performance against Arsenal wasn\u2019t good, but I thought we played well against Man City. It\u2019s always a process, and I\u2019m pretty sure there are going to be lots of things that enter the head as we have time. I think we can do better than we have and that is where my focus is on. [Newcastle] have got results and got results deservedly. That builds confidence and momentum. I have huge admiration for [Eddie Howe]. He\u2019s galvanised the team and the club.      2.14pm    Welsh schoolchildren will be allowed to swap their pencils and set squares to watch Gareth Bale and co at the World Cup from their classrooms. This from PA: The Welsh government has left it for schools to decide how to manage the Iran game, which kicks off at 10am on Friday 25 November. Wales will be playing at their first World Cup for 64 years in Qatar and their other two group games, against the United States and England, have later kick-offs at 7pm.The Football Association of Wales has organised a \u2018Cymru Football Friday\u2019 for the Iran game, with 1,100 schools throughout the country preparing for a \u201cfull day of football activity\u201d. FAW chief executive Noel Mooney said: \u201cWe\u2019ve worked with Welsh government and created packs so every school in the country can celebrate with bunting, footballs, flags and images of the players. We want to create a festival in all our schools and the Iran game is perfect for us. You want a child to remember it, and hopefully go on to play for us and become the future.\u201d What, no bucket hats?  Updated at 2.15pm GMT    2.07pm   Klopp has analysed 'half Saints, half Luton'  J\u00fcrgen Klopp was asked about a few different subjects. On how he has prepared for the match this weekend he said the analysts had had to look at Luton as well as Southampton.   I thought [Ralph] Hasenhuttl did an exceptional job [at Southampton]. If they showed anything it was attitude, they were highly motivated. We always expect a motivated opponent but there\u2019s not a lot of time [for Jones] to change a lot. We have analysed them half Saints/Luton.  On Trent Alexander-Arnold\u2019s England inclusion, he said: \u201c[Trent] was very pleased about the news \u2026 I\u2019m very happy for him. I heard Gary Neville said something [about Trent]. But he\u2019s now 24 and won quite a few finals, important games where you have to defend against world-class players. He was always there, defending well. I don\u2019t know why we have this discussion.\u201d He then spoke about having only seven players at the World Cup, saying: \u201cWe would usually have Diogo [Jota] as well. I\u2019m happy about the number we have for our pre-season training. Luis [D\u00edaz ] is back running outside [which is] really positive. It\u2019s our last game for a long time and that\u2019s why we want to finish on a high.\u201d And on Ibrahima Konat\u00e9\u2019s getting called up to a very good France World Cup squad, he said: \u201cHe was very good before, we can\u2019t say he learned everything here! He came back in time for the World Cup. It\u2019s worked out really well and he deserves it.\u201d     1.55pm    Afternoon. J\u00fcrgen Klopp is currently giving his thoughts on Liverpool\u2019s opponents tomorrow, Southampton, who have a new manager in Nathan Jones. I\u2019ll update you on his opinions shortly. In the meantime here\u2019s a Liverpool-related view from reader Admir Paji\u00e6: \u201cHere is unpopular opinion: Thiago is basically a Veron. He is a brilliant playmaker who signed for an English club that didn\u2019t need one.\u201d I can see where you\u2019re coming from Admir \u2013 Liverpool\u2019s strongest midfield was the brawny Wijnaldum-Fabinho-Henderson trio. Thiago is a brilliant footballer, though at Liverpool he has often seemed less than the sum of his very talented parts. Perhaps injuries haven\u2019t helped and the system perhaps isn\u2019t best suited to him, either.   Updated at 1.57pm GMT    1.37pm    Time for a spot of lunch so I\u2019ll hand the blog over to Gregg Bakowski for a while.     1.36pm   Serbia name World Cup squad  Now it\u2019s time for Serbia to reveal their hand.  Serbia\u2019s all-time top scorer Aleksandar Mitrovic, who is nursing an ankle injury, was named by coach Dragan Stojkovic in their 26-man squad for the World Cup in Qatar on Friday. Fulham striker Mitrovic, who missed their Premier League defeat to Manchester City last weekend and is a doubt for Sunday\u2019s game against Manchester United, has bagged 50 goals for his country and is in the squad along with Juventus striker Dusan Vlahovic. The duo, who have scored 17 goals between them for their clubs this season, are expected to lead the line for Serbia at the Nov. 20-Dec. 18 tournament with Fiorentina\u2019s 24-year-old Luka Jovic waiting in the wings. Serbia will be captained by Ajax Amsterdam\u2019s Dusan Tadic, who has 90 caps for the national team, scoring 18 times. Their midfield will also be led by Lazio\u2019s versatile Sergej Milinkovic-Savic, who has six goals in 35 appearances for the national team.Predrag Rajkovic is the most experienced goalkeeper in the squad but Torino\u2019s Vanja Milinkovic-Savic, who has six caps, started in four of their six Nations League matches earlier this year. Serbia are in Group G alongside Brazil, Switzerland and Cameroon. Serbia, who have never moved past the group stages, take on five-times champions Brazil in their opening group game on Nov. 24.They will first play a friendly match with Bahrain in Manama on Nov. 18 before flying to their base in Doha a day later. (Reuters) Goalkeepers: Marko Dmitrovic, Predrag Rajkovic, Vanja Milinkovic-SavicDefenders: Stefan Mitrovic, Nikola Milenkovic, Strahinja Pavlovic, Milos Veljkovic, Filip Mladenovic, Strahinja Erakovic, Srdjan BabicMidfielders: Nemanja Gudelj, Sergej Milinkovic-Savic, Sasa Lukic, Marko Grujic, Filip Kostic, Uros Racic, Nemanja Maksimovic, Ivan Ilic, Andrija Zivkovic, Darko LazovicForwards: Dusan Tadic (captain), Aleksandar Mitrovic, Dusan Vlahovic, Filip Duricic, Luka Jovic, Nemanja Radonjic     1.29pm    If you hadn\u2019t noticed, Spain are going to the World Cup without Manchester United goalkeeper David de Gea and Liverpool midfielder Thiago Alcantara. Imagine being that blessed in midfield that you can do without Thiago! He\u2019d surely get into any other squad heading to Qatar. At least there\u2019s still one World Cup winner in the family: nowhere near as talented dad, Mazinho, who lifted the trophy with Brazil in 1994. Different sorts of players I guess. Anyway, more here from Reuters on the manager\u2019s thinking.  Luis Enrique declined to comment on the players who were left out, but the absence of veterans like De Gea, Thiago and Barcelona defender Marcos Alonso points to the manager\u2019s preference to go all-in with Spain\u2019s new generation of talent. De Gea has fallen out of favour with Luis Enrique who said in March he \u201cwanted to test other goalkeepers\u201d and Thiago saw his role diminish with the rise of Barca teenagers Pedri, 19, and 18-year-old Gavi. \u201cYouth gives you freedom because you are not yet aware of the consequences,\u201d Luis Enrique said. \u201cYet, most of the youngsters that are with us are already in high-level teams. The bar that I\u2019m setting is infinity. My goal is to compete in every game. There\u2019s no one outside of Spain who rules out Spain as a candidate to be among the best.\u201d     1.19pm    On a weekend where Nathan Jones had expected to welcome Rotherham to Kenilworth Road, the former Luton boss will now be heading to Anfield as manager of Southampton. Talking about his first few days at St Mary\u2019s, the 49-year-old Welshman said: \u201cWe have to make small steps and we have to make them quickly. All I\u2019ve done is address them and ask them for a few key things. I can\u2019t do ground-breaking work in a day because of the game on Wednesday (Southampton beat Sheffield Wednesday in the Carabao Cup on penalties) and the amount of people who played.  \u201cYesterday was a recovery day and I only get today to work with them. It won\u2019t be some sort of categorical shift in how we play, but I hope it will be an uplift in energy and that they work for the club and for me. Anfield is one of the toughest places in Europe to go, but what a great start. You can be scared or excited by it. You can be motivated by it, and I\u2019m definitely one of those.\u201d Jones says he has had a \u201cwhirlwind week\u201d travelling up and down the country and opened up on his family connections with Southampton at his first media conference. His wife\u2019s great-grandfather played for Southampton and all her family are supporters of the club.Jones laughed: \u201cSo there\u2019s zero pressure. My wife\u2019s dad has already been giving me tips, so he\u2019s been blocked. I can\u2019t have that! But, seriously, it\u2019s a wonderful connection for that family.\u201d (PA Media)     1.10pm    A bit more on that Spain World Cup squad from AP. Twenty-year-old Barcelona forward Ansu Fati was included in Spain\u2019s squad for the World Cup on Friday. Ansu has not played for Spain since making his fourth appearance as a teenager in October 2020 shortly after breaking the record for Spain\u2019s youngest scorer. His spectacular start for Spain and Barcelona was cut short by leg injuries. Besides Fati, there were no other surprises when Spain coach Luis Enrique announced his 26-man squad. The former midfielder, who played in three World Cups, will rely on a young team in Qatar, including Barcelona midfielders Pedri Gonzalez (19) and Gavi Paez (18). \u201cWe are going to war in Qatar,\u201d Luis Enrique said. Luis Enrique guided a similar Spain squad to the semi-finals of last year\u2019s European Championships. Spain\u2019s players will travel to Jordan on Monday, where they will play a friendly against that country\u2019s national team on November 17. They will then fly to Doha, where the team will have its base camp during the World Cup. Spain will play their opening match at the World Cup against Costa Rica on November 23. The 2010 champions will also face Germany and Japan in Group E.     12.59pm    This is a lovely story about Wales. And, yes, those bucket hats are a nod to the Stone Roses.

Can Liverpool\u2019s Darwin Nunez and former Reds striker Luis Suarez cause havoc? Edinson Cavani is also named although the former PSG and Manchester United striker is not fully fit.  (Reuters) Uruguay have gambled on the recovery of Ronald Araujo in naming the Barcelona defender in their 26-man squad for the World Cup in Qatar, while Valencia striker Edinson Cavani also gets the green light despite a recent injury scare. Araujo, a linchpin of the Uruguayan defence, underwent thigh surgery after an injury while on national team duty in September and has been making a steady recovery, the country\u2019s soccer federation chief said on Thursday. The inaugural World Cup winners have gone for a mix of youth and experience, including the ageing Luis Suarez, Diego Godin and Cavani in what are almost certain to be their last appearances at soccer\u2019s showpiece event. The 35-year-old Cavani has netted four times in his seven league games for Valencia this season but faces a race against time to recover from an ankle injury with less than two weeks to go before Uruguay\u2019s opener with South Korea. Uruguay, who also meet Portugal and Ghana in Group H, have included Real Madrid\u2019s Federico Valverde and Tottenham Hotspur\u2019s Rodrigo Bentancur in the midfield as well as Liverpool\u2019s Darwin Nunez and Giorgian De Arrascaeta of Flamengo among the forwards. Goalkeepers: Fernando Muslera (Galatasaray), Sergio Rochet (Nacional), Sebastian Sosa (Independiente)Defenders: Jose Maria Gimenez (Atletico Madrid), Sebastian Coates (Sporting CP), Diego Godin (Velez Sarsfield), Martin Caceres (LA Galaxy), Ronald Araujo (Barcelona), Guillermo Varela (Flamengo), Jose Luis Rodriguez (Nacional), Mathias Olivera (Napoli), Matias Vina (Roma)Midfielders: Lucas Torreira (Galatasaray), Manuel Ugarte (Sporting CP), Matias Vecino (Lazio), Rodrigo Bentancur (Tottenham Hotspur), Federico Valverde (Real Madrid), Facundo Pellistri (Manchester United), Nicolas De La Cruz (River Plate)Forwards: Agustin Canobbio (Athletico Paranaense), Facundo Torres (Orlando City), Giorgian De Arrascaeta (Flamengo), Maxi Gomez (Trabzonspor), Luis Suarez (Nacional), Edinson Cavani (Valencia), Darwin Nunez (Liverpool)     12.42pm    After a massive eight years of hurt since winning the 2014 World Cup in Brazil, is it Germany\u2019s time again? Analysis here in our hot-of-the-press team guide.      12.33pm    Back to the Premier League and Everton manager Frank Lampard will target attacking reinforcements in January as he sees to find a solution to their goalscoring problems. The Toffees have managed a paltry 11 goals in 14 Premier League games this season. Injury-plagued striker Dominic Calvert-Lewin is currently dealing with three issues and while the hamstring problem sustained in last weekend\u2019s defeat against Leicester will keep him out of Saturday\u2019s trip to Bournemouth, a previously dislocated shoulder and, more significantly, a knee injury from the start of the season are ongoing issues. Everton have scored just 11 goals in 14 Premier League matches - their top scorer is Anthony Gordon with three - and it is an area which Lampard knows needs to be addressed. \u201cWe are certainly considering it in the squad,\u201d said the former midfielder when asked whether attacking signings were a priority in January. \u201cWhen we looked at the (summer) window I knew we had to strengthen throughout the squad in different areas and the priority was to stop conceding and be more solid through midfield. It (attack) may be the next step, considering we haven\u2019t had Dominic as well for a big portion of this season so far, to give ourselves more options in an attacking sense to help the squad. \u201cLeicester (last weekend\u2019s 2-0 defeat) is a prime example: it was tightly-contested, 50-50 possession, they have got some really good players and a threat and we missed two really big chances and they scored two amazing goals. Those things in both boxes can be really critical.\u201d Calvert-Lewin has managed just 339 minutes of football - and completed 90 minutes just once - so far after a knee injury on the eve of the season sidelined him for two months. Lampard hopes the break for the World Cup will give them chance to sort finally sort his issues. \u201cThe hamstring is a small injury, it is a 10-day injury as such which is slightly irrelevant now. The shoulder was a whack he took against Newcastle (a month ago) and he had a recurrence against Fulham. He has been strapped up a lot and it was something which was looked at by a specialist yesterday and doesn\u2019t need any surgery. He has been getting through with some issues but the knee is probably the most prominent injury that we want to get right, which is a similar to what he had before and it\u2019s been aggravated so this period gives us time to get it back right. We hope the break comes at a good time for him and we expect him back for Wolves on Boxing Day.\u201d (PA Media)     12.24pm   Spain and Netherlands announce World Cup squads  The World Cup squad announcements keep rolling in. Spain and the Netherlands are the latest countries to reveal their 26-man line-ups. Remember, if England finished second in their group, they\u2019ll play the winners of Group A and there\u2019s a strong chance that could be Virgil van Dijk and co. Netherlands coach Louis van Gaal included injured Barcelona forward Memphis Depay and uncapped teenager Xavi Simons in his 26-man squad for the World Cup, but left out veteran goalkeeper Jasper Cillessen.  Depay has not played since limping off during the Netherlands\u2019 Nations League match against Poland on Sept. 22, and has played less than 150 minutes for Barcelona this season. But Van Gaal had already said his top scorer would be certain of a place as long as there was a chance of him playing during the tournament. Xavi Simons, 19, has made a strong impression since his move from Paris St Germain to PSV Eindhoven this summer, scoring eight goals in 13 league matches. Van Gaal sprung a surprise in goal by leaving out 33-year-old Cillessen, who rejoined his old club NEC Nijmegen from Valencia this summer in the hope of reviving his international career. Goalkeepers: Justin Bijlow (Feyenoord), Andries Noppert (Heerenveen), Remko Pasveer (Ajax Amsterdam)Defenders: Nathan Ake (Manchester City), Daley Blind (Ajax), Virgil van Dijk (Liverpool), Denzel Dumfries (Internazionale), Jeremie Frimpong (Bayer Leverkusen), Matthijs de Ligt (Bayern Munchen), Tyrell Malacia (Manchester United), Jurrien Timber (Ajax), Stefan de Vrij (Internazionale)Midfielders: Steven Berghuis (Ajax), Frenkie de Jong (Barcelona), Davy Klaassen (Ajax), Teun Koopmeiners (Atalanta Bergamo), Marten de Roon (Atalanta Bergamo), Xavi Simons (PSV Eindhoven), Kenneth Taylor (Ajax)Forwards: Steven Bergwijn (Ajax), Memphis Depay (Barcelona), Cody Gakpo (PSV), Vincent Janssen (Antwerp), Luuk de Jong (PSV), Noah Lang (Club Brugge), Wout Weghorst (Besiktas). Spain coach Luis Enrique named this 26-man squad: Goalkeepers: Unai Simon (Athletic Club), Robert Sanchez (Brighton &amp; Hove Albion), David Raya (Brentford FC).Defenders: Cesar Azpilicueta (Chelsea FC), Dani Carvajal (Real Madrid), Eric Garcia (FC Barcelona), Hugo Guillamon (Valencia CF), Pau Torres (Villarreal CF), Aymeric Laporte (Manchester City), Jordi Alba (FC Barcelona), Jose Gaya (Valencia CF).Midfielders: Sergio Busquets (FC Barcelona), Rodri Hernandez (Manchester City), Gavi (FC Barcelona), Carlos Soler (Paris St Germain), Marcos Llorente (Atletico de Madrid), Pedri Gonzalez (FC Barcelona), Koke Resurreccion (Atletico de Madrid).Forwards: Ferran Torres (FC Barcelona), Nico Williams (Athletic Club), Yeremi Pino (Villarreal CF), Alvaro Morata (Atletico de Madrid), Marco Asensio (Real Madrid), Pablo Sarabia (Paris St Germain), Dani Olmo (RB Leipzig), Ansu Fati (FC Barcelona) (Reuters)     12.14pm    More details on Sade Mane\u2019s injury and his inclusion in Senegal\u2019s World Cup squad. Senegal coach Aliou Cisse is confident Mane could recover in time to play at the tournament. He said Senegal had sent the Senegalese federation\u2019s doctor to examine Mane on Thursday and had been told he would not require surgery. \u201dThat\u2019s very good news and we now have the chance to try and get him fit for the tournament. We now have two weeks to observe and see how the injury reacts to treatment,\u201d Cisse said. \u201cI prefer to keep him in the squad because he is such an important part of us.\u201d The coach used the example of Watford attacker Ismaila Sarr, who had been injured going into January\u2019s Africa Cup of Nations finals, but was included in the squad and recovered after the first round to contribute to Senegal\u2019s success in the tournament. \u201cWe will do all in our power to ensure we can recover Mane in time to play,\u201d Cisse added. Cisse kept faith with the majority of the squad that won the Cup of Nations in Cameroon but did include Monaco defender Ismail Jakobs and strikers Nicolas Jackson (Villarreal) and Ilimane Ndiaye (Sheffield United), who earned their first caps after World Cup qualification was secured in March. \u201cThe players chosen correspond with our vision and philosophy. They are competitors of a high level,\u201d said Cisse, who had his contract as coach extended by a further two years on Thursday. (Reuters)     12.06pm    Story from last night. The Danish Football Association (DBU) said that Fifa had rejected Denmark\u2019s request to train at the World Cup in shirts with the words \u201chuman rights for all\u201d on them.      11.56am    Nathan Jones has been installed as the new manager of Southampton and first up for the former Luton coach is\u2026 a trip to Anfield. Ben Fisher says Jones has earned a top-flight chance.      11.47am    Paul Gascoigne has been having a word with PA media following the announcement of the England World Cup squad\u2026 Paul Gascoigne hopes the England players will gel as a team at the World Cup - rather than just counting on one of them to make the difference in Qatar. Gareth Southgate\u2019s squad open their campaign against Iran and will then take on the United States before meeting Wales in the final Group B fixture. Gascoigne reflected on his own World Cup experience 32 years ago in \u2018Italia 90: Four weeks that changed the world\u2019, which will will air on Sky Documentaries from November 13.  Tottenham midfielder Gascoigne had never started a competitive international, so was something of a controversial selection for Sir Bobby Robson\u2019s squad. Gascoigne, though, took centre stage in Italy as England built momentum from a slow start to go on and reach the semi-finals, where they were beaten on penalties by West Germany in Turin. The likes of James Maddison, Jack Grealish, Jude Bellingham, Mason Mount, Phil Foden and Bukayo Saka will all be hoping to make an impact in Qatar. Gascoigne feels it will be important how well they can all work together as a unit which will determine how far the Three Lions can go. \u201cWe have got some quality players there (in the squad), but we are talking now individual players,\u201d Gascoigne told the PA news agency. \u201cYou have got to look at a team player - I was fortunate, because in 1990 and then at Euro 96, we were a team. Today\u2019s teams have got a quite a few individual players, but it is whether you gel together, that is more important than anything else. \u201cIn 1990, I was so proud of the players that didn\u2019t play because when we scored, they were all up celebrating, there was nobody who sulked if they were not playing - some of them went there and never got a game, but they were still behind us, which is what the players are going to need more than anything. I was just 23 and the other players were coming into their prime, like Bryan Robson, John Barnes, Chris Waddle, Peter Beardsley, Gary Lineker, Terry Butcher, Peter Shilton, Stuart Pearce - they were unbelievable. So I was fortunate to be amongst all them and they just let me get on and enjoy myself, and of course Bobby Robson was a brilliant manager.\u201d As well as drawing praise for his mesmerising performances to help drive England on through the knockout stages of Italia 90, Gascoigne also captured the hearts of the nation watching back home during the semi-final. After being shown a yellow card for a challenge which appeared to make minimal contact on Thomas Berthold, so ruling him out of the final should England have progressed, the young midfielder struggled to hold back his tears.  \u201cEven to this day, I still don\u2019t think I touched him,\u201d said Gascoigne, 55. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t just the fact I was going to miss the final - I didn\u2019t want to be selfish in that way because (in) the last 20 minutes, I gave my all. It was heartbreaking to get the second yellow card after going so far (in the tournament), having done so well and really enjoyed myself. (Everyone) saying that seeing my tears changed the game around (in England) is a nice feeling - but it was certainly a shock getting back home and seeing all the fans, when it was just \u2018wow\u2019.\u201d     11.36am    Newcastle\u2019s Callum Wilson is heading to the World Cup but he may not be available for Saturday\u2019s Premier League clash against Chelsea.  (Per PA Media) Newcastle boss Eddie Howe has saluted Callum Wilson\u2019s resilience after the striker was called up to England\u2019s World Cup squad. The 30-year-old has battled his way through a series of injuries, including two cruciate ligament ruptures, to make it into the party for Qatar. Howe, who signed him for Bournemouth back in 2014, said: \u201cIt\u2019s an amazing thing for him individually and I\u2019m sure for his family. Callum has had a difficult career, it\u2019s not always been about the successes. He\u2019s had huge successes and he\u2019s risen from the lower leagues to the Premier League and now to the national squad at a World Cup. It\u2019s been a brilliant thing to witness at first hand for me.  \u201cThen when you see how it\u2019s been achieved, you see it\u2019s been through dedication, consistency in his work, a really positive mindset. Even sometimes when he would get injured, his first instinct was always, \u2018I\u2019m going to come back better\u2019 and then he put the work in to come back better, so it\u2019s not just talk with Callum, he actually delivers. He\u2019s got a way of scoring goals, a uniqueness about him, so I\u2019m delighted for him and I hope that he can go and I hope he can make real impact.\u201d Wilson, who won his last cap in 2019, is facing a race to be fit for his club\u2019s final Premier League game before the World Cup break, against Chelsea on Saturday evening, after struggling with illness in the last week. He came off at half-time in Sunday\u2019s 4-1 win at Southampton feeling the after-effects and missed the midweek Carabao Cup victory over Crystal Palace.  Asked if he would be available, Howe said: \u201cWe\u2019ll wait and see. He\u2019s been training separately from the group this week. He had an illness, so he\u2019s been away from the group. He\u2019s been working well but I need to make a decision on whether he\u2019s fit enough to play.\u201d     11.27am    We\u2019ve reached Costa Rica in our World Cup 2022 team guides. Makeweights? Well, let\u2019s not forget 2014 when they somehow topped a group featuring England, Italy and Uruguay before reaching the quarter-finals.      11.20am    Four Armed Forces personnel will take charge of the League One fixture between Cambridge United and Bolton Wanderers on Remembrance Weekend. For the first time, the Royal Air Force, British Army and Royal Navy will all be represented during the match at the Abbey Stadium on Saturday. The RAF\u2019s Sergeant Darren Drysdale will be the referee, supported by his two assistant referees - the Army\u2019s Corporal Declan O\u2019Shea and Captain Steve Finch. The Royal Navy\u2019s Chief Petty Officer Scott Jackson will be the fourth official, completing a team with almost 100 years of combined military service.  Updated at 11.36am GMT    11.13am    The pre-World Cup conspiracy theories are starting. Michael Gibson emails in with this: \u201cI saw your earlier comment re Southgate having kittens when Harry Kane contests 50-50s against Leeds. I bet Brenden Aaronson has been primed by Greg Berhalter to leave one in on Kane or Eric Dier if he gets the chance. Actually the reverse might also be true.\u201d Yeah, and this bloke I know reckons he knows a bloke, who\u2019s friends with a guy that works for Match of the Day who reckons Aaronson and Callum Wilson are best mates so crocking Kane makes perfect sense.  Updated at 11.18am GMT    11.09am    Time, dear readers, for YOUR help (pointy finger emoji). How well will your team perform at the World Cup? What is the mood like at home? Whether you\u2019re cheering on one of the favourites or supporting an underdog, share your hopes and expectations with us by filling out the form in the article below.      10.58am    Here\u2019s Barney Ronay\u2019s take on England\u2019s World Cup squad. \u201cThis is not to say that England have an obvious champion squad. But it is the best squad Southgate could have picked, one that on the face of it offers no space to carp or rage at talent squandered, favouritism applied. \u201cA first XI of Jordan Pickford in goal, Kieran Tripper, John Stones, Harry Maguire (who will play, and who is also more suited to the sedentary rhythms of England football) and Luke Shaw in defence; the Rice-Phillips-Bellingham trio, plus Southgate\u2019s favoured front three of Kane-Sterling-Foden \u2026 this looks pretty good.\u201d      10.48am    \u201cWe\u2019re on our way, we are Gareth\u2019s 26\u2026\u201d. Okay, it doesn\u2019t quite have the same ring to it as 1982 but Southgate\u2019s squad are nearly on their way. Will they get it right? This time? Here\u2019s the story and squad if somehow your missed it. And below it a link to see Dave Watson, Steve Foster, Joe Corrigan et al recording their smash No.2 hit.

Updated at 10.53am GMT    10.33am   Sadio Mane named in Senegal World Cup squad  Breaking news: Sadio Mane shall go to the ball \u2013 but how fit is he? It was always likely Senegal would do everything to patch him up although maybe this has echoes of Keegan and Brooking in \u201882. Perhaps he can recover during the group stage before returning in the last 16 for a likely clash with England if my When Saturday Comes wallchart prediction works out. Here\u2019s the Reuters report. Sadio Mane has been named in Senegal\u2019s squad for the World Cup in Qatar despite injury concerns after he was hurt playing for his German club at the weekend.  The 30-year-old striker, whose decisive penalty kicks won both the Africa Cup of Nations and World Cup qualification for his country this year, suffered an injury to his right fibula in Bayern\u2019s 6-1 win against Werder Bremen and misses this weekend\u2019s clash against Schalke. But coach Aliou Cisse included the team\u2019s talisman when he named his 26-man squad at a news conference in Dakar on Friday  Updated at 10.56am GMT    10.25am    Manchester United made it through to the last 16 of the Carabao Cup with a 4-2 win over Aston Villa last night, Qatar-bound Marcus Rashford getting the hosts\u2019 second. Here\u2019s Jamie Jackson\u2019s match report.  In bonkers scheduling news, the fourth round ties are being squeezed in between the World Cup final (December 18) and the resumption of the Premier League (December 26). Manchester City kids/reserves v Liverpool kids/reserves is the standout tie. Here\u2019s the draw. Wolves v GillinghamSouthampton v Lincoln CityBlackburn Rovers v Nottingham ForestNewcastle v BournemouthManchester City v LiverpoolManchester United v BurnleyMK Dons v LeicesterCharlton v Brighton      10.16am    Let\u2019s kick off with a weekly staple. Gonna miss you my friend. \u201cMaddison will hope to sign off from domestic duty by helping Leicester beat West Ham. Standing in his way, though, will be an international teammate: Declan Rice. This is a huge game for West Ham\u2019s captain. David Moyes\u2019s side are two points above the bottom three after stinking the place out against Crystal Palace last weekend and they could do with an inspirational midfield display from Rice.\u201d      10.11am   Preamble  And for the final time until Boxing Day, here we go with another round of Premier League fixtures. Sounds weird doesn\u2019t it but due to a World Cup in Qatar being plonked in the middle of the season, when the Fulham v Manchester United game finishes at around 6.20pm on Sunday, the Premier League table will be frozen in time for (checks calendar) 43 days. While Premier League managers strive to leave the standings looking as favourable for them as possible - Patrick Vieira\u2019s Crystal Palace could actually go into the break in sixth if an awful lot went their way - World Cup-bound bosses will spend the weekend chewing finger nails. Senegal manager Aliou Cisse is already cursing that star man Sadio Mane may not be fit after picking up an injury playing for Bayern Munich this week so Gareth Southgate will be having kittens every time Harry Kane contests a 50-50 in Tottenham\u2019s home game against a Leeds side not known for standing back and admiring. Let\u2019s go then. If you\u2019re looking for team news, hot press conference quotes and World Cup build-up, step right this way\u2026  Updated at 10.13am GMT "

                    "body": "So much for football being a game that lasts 90 minutes. Or the sight of a fourth official holding up a board showing two or three minutes of added time. At this tournament, the 100min-plus match is becoming the new normal.\nEngland\u2019s 6-2 victory against Iran on Monday lasted a record\u2011breaking 117min, with 14min 08sec of stoppage time in the first half and 13min 08sec in the second. Argentina\u2019s shock 2-1 defeat against Saudi Arabia on Tuesday was not far behind, lasting 111min. Forget Fergie Time, welcome to Fifa Time.\n\nThe reason, Fifa has confirmed, is down to a new directive to ensure all \u201cunnatural lost time\u201d is added at the end of each half. In Qatar it has asked officials to more accurately monitor when a game is stopped for goal celebrations, time wasting, video assistant referee decisions, substitutions, penalties and red cards \u2013 even if it means extending a match by many minutes.\nPierluigi Collina, the chairman of Fifa\u2019s referees committee, said last week: \u201cIf we want to have more active time, we need to be ready to see this kind of additional time given.\n\u201cThink of a match where in a half there are three goals. The celebration normally takes one to one and a half minutes. With three goals, basically you lose five, six minutes. So what we really want to do is to accurately calculate the time to be added.\u201d\n\nAccording to Opta, the average game time in the first six matches of this World Cup was 106min 12sec, compared with 97min 12sec in 2018. It said the four halves with the most stoppage time in a World Cup match since records began in 1966 were all on Monday, with time added on in the second halves of USA v Wales and Senegal v Netherlands both being more than 10min. That was before the added time in Argentina\u2019s second half against Saudi Arabia, which came to 14min.\nSome of that was down to extended injury breaks: the Iran goalkeeper, Alireza Beiranvand, sustained concussion after a clash of heads against England and the Saudi defender Yasser al-Shahrani was knocked out by a flying knee from his own keeper, Mohammed al-Owais, in injury time.\n\nCollina made Fifa\u2019s position clear, saying: \u201cIf we want to protect the image of the game we must calculate time and add it on at the end of each half. We do not want matches where the ball is only in play for 43, 44 or 45 minutes. We must make sure the time is fair for both teams.\u201d\nIfab, football\u2019s law-making body, rejected a proposal for games to be reduced to 60min of \u201ceffective playing time\u201d with the clock stopped when the ball goes out of play. Last season the ball was in play on average in the Premier League for just over 55min but in some leagues it can drop as low as 45min."

                    "body": "Darling Harbour will host thousands of fans in central Sydney when the Socceroos take on Argentina on Sunday, the New South Wales premier has announced. Dominic Perrottet on Thursday named Tumbalong Park as the big screen viewing site after his first suggestion, the Sydney Opera House, was unavailable. The Opera House sails will, however, be lit up in green and gold from 8pm on Saturday until dawn Sunday. A large screen at Tumbalong Park will show the lead-up and match from 5.30am on Sunday. The event itself will be alcohol-free with nearby retailers encouraged to open early and licensed venues operating with extended trading hours. Transport will be free across Sydney from 4am to midday.  Perrottet promised on Thursday morning to set up an \u201cawesome\u201d live viewing site following jubilant scenes of fans in Melbourne\u2019s Federation Square celebrating the team\u2019s win over Denmark on Thursday morning. He said the government was looking at \u201cthe best\u201d spots for the upcoming match against Argentina to take place on Sunday at 6am AEDT. Speaking at a press conference in North Sydney, Perrottet said while the venue was yet to be confirmed, it would be the best site in the country and he flagged the Sydney Opera House as the \u201ckey location\u201d. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have a great live site,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be the best in the country because this is the best city in the world, so it\u2019s going to be awesome.\u201d But a spokesperson for the Opera House subsequently said the forecourt was already booked for its December season.  Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup  When asked why Sydney did not yet have a site and hadn\u2019t had one in place for the first three qualifier games, the premier said: \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d \u201cBut what I can say is what\u2019s important is that we\u2019ve made the round of 16,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a phenomenal result for Australian soccer, the inspiration that will provide young boys and girls right across NSW is going to be phenomenal and I want everybody in the city and across the state to come out and enjoy the game and we\u2019ll be doing everything we can to do that.\u201d A government spokesperson later said an announcement on the site would be forthcoming. A spokesperson for the Royal Botanic Garden Sydney said the Domain was unavailable due to a planned event on Saturday evening. NSW pubs and clubs were able to stay open until 5am to screen the Denmark game in Sydney, but although hundreds took to the CBD\u2019s George Street in an impromptu celebration, no formal public site was established for fans to watch the match.  The NSW opposition leader, Chris Minns, questioned why Sydney was not prepared with a major live viewing site like Melbourne\u2019s Federation Square and called for the government to act immediately. Thousands of diehard fans descended on the CBD site from late Wednesday evening in full green and gold to cheer on the Socceroos. \u201cWe should have had an opportunity to come together to watch this game together,\u201d Minns said before the Darling Harbour venue was announced. \u201cThere are many opportunities to have a live site in Sydney, whether it\u2019s Martin Place or somewhere else in the communal spaces in the CBD.\u201d He also flagged western Sydney where \u201cmany [fans] are located\u201d. A string of Sydney councils announced their own plans on Thursday. The city of Canterbury-Bankstown opened Beaman and Playford Park to the public for the Socceroos v Tunisia match last Saturday and the mayor, Khal Asfour, said they would do so again on Sunday. The Inner West mayor, Darcy Byrne, also confirmed his council would hold a live broadcast of Sunday morning\u2019s match on a big screen at Enmore Park, while Liverpool city council said it would screen the match from Macquarie Mall in its CBD. The Liverpool mayor, Ned Mannoun, said the mall was set to become the \u201cFederation Square of Sydney\u201d. \u201cHere in Liverpool we come from many different countries, but when it comes to soccer, we are all Australian,\u201d he said. The NSW minister for cities, Rob Stokes, said Australians would be \u201cin loud voice\u201d at Tumbalong Park. \u201cThis is one of those rare moments in time where we can get together in the greatest city in the world to celebrate living in the greatest country in the world,\u201d he said.  Other capital cities around the country have moved to established live hubs for fans after Australia\u2019s shock 1-0 victory to Denmark. Brisbane\u2019s lord mayor, Adrian Schrinner, said the city council was \u201ctalking to the broadcaster\u201d about showing the Socceroos\u2019 last-16 match against Argentina live in King George Square and the Queen Street Mall. Brisbane football fan James Price, who sits with \u201cthe Den\u201d \u2013 the active supporters of the Brisbane Roar \u2013 at every match, said Brisbane had dabbled with live screenings of big football matches before without attracting much participation. \u201cBut I think there\u2019s just a different wave and generation of support now who are keen to do it,\u201d he said. \u201cEveryone\u2019s been watching what\u2019s going on down in Melbourne and we\u2019re keen to have something similar here in Brisbane. I think this could be the perfect time to give this a go and show that Brisbane people are just as mad and keen as people in Melbourne.\u201d The South Australian premier, Peter Malinaukas, said a live site would be established at a plaza at the Adelaide Oval, complete with two large screens. \u2013 Joe Hinchliffe contributed to this report"

                    "body": "When Ankaragucu host Besiktas on Sunday there will be a former MK Dons forward taking to the field, aiming to prove his talents on Turkey\u2019s biggest stage, while having half an eye on making the Qatar World Cup. To add to the similarities, like Dele Alli, Gboly Ariyibi spent a number of his early years in Nigeria. The two will come face-to-face at Eryaman Stadium in the Super Lig where they find themselves a long way from home. This is not the first time they have met. Ariyibi, then of Chesterfield, was an unused sub against MK Dons in 2014, and the future England international made an impression. \u201cI remember watching him and seeing his playing maturity, he was a cut above League One, even then,\u201d Ariyibi says. \u201cI knew he wouldn\u2019t be there for long.\u201d  The route to the Turkish capital has been circuitous for Ariyibi. He came through the ranks at Southampton but was released without making an appearance. He was playing Sunday league while he trialled at clubs up and down the country from Bolton to Bournemouth, and even turned up at Leyton Orient with boots in hand hoping to force them to give him a chance. Eventually his then agent Lee Payne set up a trial with Leeds, Ariyibi got on the train at London\u2019s King\u2019s Cross and never came back. Ariyibi went from amateur football to playing in front of 30,000 people in the Championship in a matter of days. After a year at Elland Road he dropped down to Chesterfield from where he earned a move to Nottingham Forest, then two seasons on loan at MK Dons and Motherwell. He headed to Greek Super League team Panetolikos to show he could cut it in a top division where two successful campaigns were enough for Ankaragucu to come calling, wanting Ariyibi to help them bounce back from relegation at the first time of asking. \u201cIt was an amazing feeling, not just for the players but the fans,\u201d Ariyibi says. \u201cThere were a lot of expectations for a team that has made one of the most illustrious Turkish clubs. It was a surreal moment to make history and be part of it. You could feel the buzz around the city when we had the celebrations. The support was unmatched throughout the season and you can really see how passionate they are. Definitely my best experience in football.\u201d  Ankaragucu are back to the top table, alongside Galatasaray, Fenerbahce and Sunday\u2019s opponents Besiktas but are winless in three matches and have dispensed with their title-winning head coach. \u201cWe go in as the underdogs but we can beat anyone in this league with the support of our fans. \u201cIt is going to be a million miles away from Anfield or the Emirates for Alli. Eryaman Stadium can be a difficult place to come to as an opponent and the fans \u2013 from both sides \u2013 will be giving it everything for 90 minutes and more.\u201d His close friend Uche Ikpeazu recently left Middlesbrough to join Ariyibi in Turkey at Konyaspor. He asked for advice and Ariyibi will be happy to share his insight with Alli. \u201cIt is always nice to see people from England abroad and I genuinely think a lot more people should come out of their comfort zones. \u201cYou have quality players here and lots of big names with the likes of Alli himself. I have loads of football friends in England and they call me for advice. If I was Dele I would also feel comfortable knowing there are other homegrown talents in the same situation.  \u201cPlaying in another country is never easy, it can be very tough at times adapting to a new culture. People don\u2019t realise the sacrifices and being away from your family can be challenging. There are a few of us playing in the Super Lig and it is nice to know we are all connected in some way. I will wish him all the best.\u201d Will Ariyibi want to swap shirts with Alli? \u201cI assume he will want mine,\u201d he jokes.  Home is Oxford for Ariyibi; he has great affection for Quarry Rovers, and coaches Neil McCrea and Darren Gallacher, who helped him reach this point. Alongside Ariyibi in Ankara are the former Real Madrid winger Jes\u00e9 Rodr\u00edguez and ex-Manchester United striker Federico Macheda. Jes\u00e9 won two Champions League titles after coming through the ranks at Madrid, while Macheda is famed for his dramatic late winner as a teenager against Aston Villa at Old Trafford. \u201cI grew up as a Manchester United fan and my idol is Cristiano Ronaldo, so to have people that have trained, played and won titles with him as my teammates is quite an honour. Having these sort of talents around can only make you better and is a big turning point from being released at Southampton all those years ago. Learning from players with these careers is great and humbling.\u201d Ariyibi left England because he wanted to play at the top level. He hopes reaching the Turkish Super Lig could help boost his World Cup ambitions. He represented USA at age-group level and believes facing teams such as Besiktas can show that he is ready for the full international stage. \u201cIt\u2019s always been a dream of mine to feature in a World Cup. That would be an honour, we know what football is like and anything can happen. I feel like this season is one of my most important.\u201d A sentiment Alli might share."

AP reports that Parviz Boroumand, a retired goalkeeper, was arrested nearly two weeks ago on charges of participating in protests in the capital, Tehran, and was accused of damaging property. Voria Ghafouri was arrested last week for \u201cinsulting the national soccer team and propagandizing against the government,\u201d according to state-linked media. The judiciary announced their release Tuesday without elaborating. Ghafouri, who is still playing for a local club, has been an outspoken critic of Iranian authorities throughout his career.     2.38pm    The protester who ran onto the field during a World Cup match carrying a rainbow flag and wearing a blue Superman T-shirt with messages in support of Ukraine and Iranian women was banned Tuesday from attending any more matches during the tournament in Qatar. AP reports the World Cup organising committee said in a statement that \u201cthe individual involved was released shortly after being removed from the pitch\u201d and that his embassy had been informed. \u201cAs a consequence of his actions, and as is standard practice, his (entry permit) has been canceled and he has been banned from attending future matches at this tournament,\u201d the statement said. The protester identified himself on social media as Mario Ferri, an Italian who has carried out similar protests at soccer matches before. Ferri ran onto the field in the second half of Monday\u2019s match between Portugal and Uruguay carrying the rainbow flag. Security officials chased him down and Ferri dropped the flag on the field before he was escorted away. \u201cI\u2019ll call it, THE LAST DANCE,\u2019 my last field invasion, I wanted to send IMPORTANT messages, which I\u2019ve felt experienced first-hand in recent months,\u201d Ferri wrote in an Instagram post. Ferri wrote that he has friends in Ukraine who are suffering and that he spent a month in the country as a volunteer after Russia invaded the nation in February.     2.15pm   Foden to start for England against Wales \u2013 Rashford, Henderson, Walker also in first XI  Phil Foden is set to make his first start of the World Cup when England face Wales later today. The Manchester City midfielder was an unused substitute during England\u2019s draw with the USA and Gareth Southgate has been under a lot pressure to make more use of him. Well, here we go: Foden will come in this evening and Bukayo Saka will get a rest. Foden will be part of a rejigged England attack. Harry Kane will start up front, despite calls for Southgate to rest his captain, but Marcus Rashford is expected to replace Raheem Sterling on the left. Sterling wasn\u2019t great against the US; it\u2019s a big chance for Rashford to show he deserves more starts following his return to the squad. In midfield, Jordan Henderson will make his first start of the tournament - but despite indications to the contrary yesterday it will actually be Mason Mount who drops out for the Liverpool captain. Jude Bellingham, who was replaced by Henderson against the US, is expected to keep his place. Declan Rice will start. The fourth and final change will see Kyle Walker come in for his first start since having groin surgery in October. But it won\u2019t be in a back three. Walker will play at right-back, replacing Kieran Trippier, with Luke Shaw on the left. James Maddison should be on the bench for the first time after shaking of a knee injury. An England win would see them top Group B. They\u2019ll be at risk of going out if they lose by four goals, which seems unlikely. Wales are on the brink of elimination but are bound to be hugely motivated. Southgate expects a tough test, which is why he isn\u2019t rotating too heavily.      2.02pm   Netherlands v Qatar team news  We\u2019ve also got team news from the Netherlands\u2019 impending victory over Qatar. Memphis Depay starts for the first time. He will line up alongside Cody Gakpo in attack while coach Louis van Gaal also tinkered with his midfield, bringing in Marten de Roon. De Roon replaced Teun Koopmeiners while Depay comes in for Steven Bergwijn.

Reuters reports that in his statement he says he \u201calways behaved in a way to lead the team to success in a good manner\u201d. \u201cYesterday I was not allowed to be on the ground to help Cameroon, as always do, to achieve the team\u2019s goals,\u201d said Onana, who plays for Inter and has been capped 34 times for his country.  \u201cI have put all my efforts and energy into finding solutions to a situation that a footballer often experiences, but there has been no will on the other side. Some moments are difficult to assimilate. \u201cHowever, I always respect and support the decisions of the people in charge of pursuing the success of our team and country.\u201d Cameroon need to beat Brazil on Friday and hope for other results to go their way to progress from Group G     1.36pm    Hello, it is Martin Belam back here again, the dog has been safely walked and all is well. We are less than 90 minutes away from Netherlands v Qatar and Ecuador v Senegal kicking off to determine who emerges into the round of 16 to face one of England, Iran, the United States or Wales on Saturday and Sunday.     1.31pm    A bit of good news, here:       1.24pm    Fifa has confirmed that its whizzy matchball technology proved conclusively that Cristiano Ronaldo did not touch Bruno Fernandes\u2019 cross \u2013 and eventual goal \u2013 when Portugal took a 1-0 lead over Uruguay. Had it been awarded to Ronaldo it would have been another landmark moment for the striker, putting him level with Eusebio on nine Portugal goals at World Cups. But, nope. Here\u2019s what Fifa told ESPN:  In the match between Portugal and Uruguay, using the Connected Ball Technology housed in Adidas\u2019s Al Rihla Official Match Ball, we are able to definitively show no contact on the ball from Cristiano Ronaldo for the opening goal in the game. No external force on the ball could be measured as shown by the lack of \u2018heartbeat\u2019 in our measurements. The 500Hz IMU sensor inside the ball allows us to be highly accurate in our analysis.  Perhaps if it hadn\u2019t been a \u201cflyaway\u201d, Ronaldo would be level with Eusebio.      1.11pm   Qatar official: \u2018400-500\u2019 migrant workers died on projects  The Qatari official responsible for delivery of the 2022 World Cup has said the number of migrant workers who have died on World Cup-related projects is \u201cbetween 400 and 500\u201d. Hassan al-Thawadi, the secretary general of the Supreme Committee for delivery and legacy, made the admission in an interview but said a precise figure for the number of fatalities was still \u201cbeing discussed\u201d. \u201cThe estimate is around 400,\u201d Thawadi told the TV show Piers Morgan Uncensored. \u201cBetween 400 and 500. I don\u2019t have the precise number, that is something that is being discussed.\u201d Read the full story here:   Updated at 1.25pm GMT    1.04pm    One of the more intriguing storylines in the run-up to today\u2019s USA-Iran game has been a claim by former US striker (and part-time Guardian columnist) Eric Wynalda around Gio Reyna\u2019s lack of action at the tournament. Berhalter says the Dortmund player is carrying an injury while Wynalda says he has spoken to Reyna\u2019s father and that is not the case \u2013 and the situation is causing \u201cinternal strife\u201d in the US camp.  Berhalter addressed the issue on Monday. \u201cWhat I\u2019d say is: I\u2019ll leave it to you to decide if I asked Gio to lie about it,\u201d Berhalter told reporters. \u201cThat\u2019s just not who I am. That\u2019s not what I represent. So if you have to take Eric\u2019s word or my word or whatever, feel free, but I know what happened and that\u2019s not what I represent. Like every other person, Gio is a member of this team that we care deeply for and we know can help the team. It\u2019s a matter of when he can help us and how he can help us.\u201d The US have impressed many observers with their approach play in this World Cup - they just lack someone to finish the chances they create, a problem that cost them against Wales and England. Berhalter has not yet said who will play up front against Iran. \u201cI think [the US strikers have] been OK,\u201d Berhalter said. \u201cWhen we\u2019re evaluating the performance in the first game, Josh had a good chance at the near post and, looking at the second game, Haji was very effective on the defensive end of the game, had some good runs into the channel, very lively. Perhaps there were a couple of times when we could have been more effective with the movement in the penalty box.\u201d     1.00pm    Right, I\u2019m going to take a break for a bit, and drag a somewhat unwilling dog out into the cold for a walk. In the meantime, this caught my eye on the picture wires from Qatar earlier. I\u2019ve absolutely no context for this at all*, but apparently this fine specimen won a camel beauty contest in Ash-Shahaniyah, Qatar this morning, with all the World Cup flags fluttering in the background.  [*I do have context, because I once spent a month in Doha. Everyone loves camels. They are just like having less-thirsty horses, so of course there are camel shows and camel races. If you have camels it is just like having an extended family.]     12.56pm    David Brooks has visited the Wales squad just hours before the make or break World Cup clash with England today, PA reports. Brooks has not played since 29 September 2021 after being diagnosed with stage two Hodgkin lymphoma the following month. The 25-year-old Bournemouth forward announced in May that he had been given the all clear after completing his treatment and has slowly been working his way back to fitness since. Brooks missed out on World Cup selection but has now joined Robert Page\u2019s squad in Qatar as they prepared for their final group game. Football Association of Wales chief medical officer Jonathan Houghton wrote on his Instagram account: \u201cSeeing Brooks fit and smiling made my day. It\u2019s been a long road back from Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma, but I think I can safely say that we all can\u2019t wait until he pulls on a Wales shirt again. Hoping that he will run out for Bournemouth in the next 4-6 weeks.\u201d Brooks\u2019 return to action before the Premier League took a break for the World Cup was delayed by a hamstring problem.     12.52pm    I asked earlier what people were doing to fill in the time, now that there is a huge 1pm GMT hole in ten minutes where a Fifa World Cup match should be. I got a mixed bunch of answers. Philip Rebbeck says the end of the early kick-offs is a disaster for him in Malaysia, adding \u201cMalaysia which is 5 hours ahead of Qatar so the early starts were at 6pm and 9pm. Very handy, but now we are faced with a less appealing 11pm and a frankly brutal 3am for England v Wales.\u201d I\u2019ve had several replies along the lines of \u201cI\u2019m not missing the early kick-off slots because I\u2019ve got work to do.\u201d Ian Barker is in Munich, and speaks for many I suspect in saying that \u201cI would normally take time off work myself for World Cup and Euros because for me it\u2019s as much about beer gardens and barbecues as it is about the entertainment\u201d. He says instead in Munich it is cold and wet, students are working, and a best you might have the football on in the background over dinner. Andrew Read says he has passed the time not watching the football by working out which confederation is most under-performing. He has Concacaf firmly in his sights with Canada out and Costa Rica, Mexico and the US all facing uphill tasks. For his part, William North says he did not foresee a day when he would be looking back on the addition of 12 minutes of first half stoppage time with rose tinted glasses. I am telling you this stoppage time scenario is going to cause havoc with these simultaneous group match kick offs.     12.30pm    Downing Street has said that the UK\u2019s prime minister Rishi Sunak would be supporting England in tonight\u2019s World Cup match against Wales, while also hoping that both teams can advance \u201cas far as possible\u201d in the competition. The prime minister\u2019s official spokesperson said: \u201cObviously we want both teams to progress as far as possible. I think the prime minister personally is an England supporter. He\u2019s talked about that before, but certainly we want both teams to progress as far as possible.\u201d A pedant \u2013 i.e. me \u2013 notes that the only way Wales can advance any further at all in the tournament is to win tonight, so surely Sunak needs to get his Welsh bucket hat on for the evening? Our political editor Pippa Crerar tells me that Sunak will be watching the game accompanied by schoolchildren from both England and Wales who have been picked by their respective FAs.     12.22pm    New David Squires has dropped \u2026      12.03pm    Those of us long in the tooth enough to have watched the 1982 World Cup unfold live will know that the reason the final two group stage matches are played simultaneously these days is to avoid a \u201cDisgrace of Gij\u00f3n\u201d type of situation. In that 1982 match in northern Spain, the West German and Austria teams took the field knowing that the two of them would progress from Group 2 at the expense of Algeria \u2013 who had played their final group game the day before \u2013 if West Germany won by 1-0 or 2-0, but that any other score would knock one of them out. Lo and behold, after West Germany scored in the tenth minute, the match gradually ground to a standstill as both teams knew they\u2019d done enough to progress. Fans were literally waving money at the players from the stands to indicate they believed the match was being fixed.  I do wonder if we might end up seeing some scenes reminiscent of this during this week. Surely at some point we will end up with one match still going on with 12 minutes of World Cup bonus stoppage time, the other having finished, and teams knowing that as it stands they are both through? Incidentally, Rob Smyth picked that West Germany v Austria game as one of our \u201cWorld Cup stunning moments\u201d in the run-up to the last World Cup, and his piece is well worth a read: West Germany 1-0 Austria in 1982      11.41am    I can\u2019t be the only person twiddling my thumbs a bit thinking that I should have spent the last hour-and-a-half or so since 10am GMT watching some World Cup football, and struggling to adjust to the end of the two early kick off slots. Do let me know how you are filling the time \u2013 you can email me at martin.belam@theguardian.com. If you put \u201cWORLD CUP BLOG\u201d in the subject line I\u2019ll be able to pick them out more easily from the people in my inbox constantly complaining about the answers in my quizzes.     11.36am    We have a piece by Chris Evans today looking at the last time that the US and Iran met each other at the World Cup, including the memories of the then-US coach Steve Sampson: \u201cIf I was to do it all over again, I\u2019d make it more political,\u201d says Steve Sampson. \u201cI would use history as motivation for my players \u2013 that they [Iran] held American citizens captive for the longest period of time and are one of the greatest enemies ever faced by the United States. I wanted to make it all about the football and depoliticise the whole event because, for me, our football was on display. Whereas for the Iranians, it was their politics on display.\u201d It\u2019s a pretty explosive statement to make considering the atmosphere around the match, which the president of the US Soccer federation, Alan Rothenberg, called \u201cthe mother of all games\u201d. Sampson believes that, while his attempt to anaesthetise any possible security issues may have been wise, it also left his side ill-prepared for a contest that was about much more than three points. Sampson went along with the plan to play things down while preparing his team, but that was not the case in the opposite dressing room. Iran\u2019s players were all too aware of the importance of the match and they started ferociously, taking the lead towards the end of the first half. \u201cI later found out that at half-time, a top politician from the Iranian government came down to the locker room and collected all the passports of the Iranians and said: \u2018You lose this, you\u2019ll never return home,\u2019\u201d says Sampson, who was later informed of what had happened by the Iran head coach Jalal Talebi. \u201cI achieved what I wanted to do \u2013 which was to make it a football event \u2013 not a political event, but the Iranians did exactly what they wanted to do. They made it a political event.\u201d Read more here: Chris Evans \u2013 \u2018I\u2019d make it more political\u2019: when USA lost to Iran at the World Cup in 1998      11.16am    Fifa have opened a disciplinary case against Croatia because of its fans\u2019 taunts aimed at the Canada goalkeeper who has Serbian family ties during the teams\u2019 World Cup game, Reuters reports.  Fifa said the charge against the Croatian soccer federation was \u201cdue to the behaviour of its fans\u201d and cited rules relating to discrimination and security at games. Canada goalkeeper Milan Borjan was born in an ethnic Serb region of Croatia that was part of the conflict that split the former Yugoslavia in the 1990s. Borjan\u2019s family left their hometown in 1995 when it was taken by Croatian forces amid stories that ethnic Serbs fled on tractors. During Canada\u2019s 4-1 loss on Sunday, one banner displayed by Croatia fans used a flag of tractor manufacturer John Deere and changed the marketing slogan to target Borjan.  Borjan moved as a child with his family to Canada and chose to represent that country at soccer, though he plays for Red Star Belgrade in Serbia. Fifa gave no timetable for a verdict in the case which would typically produce a fine.     10.39am    The people being hauled out for media duties in Qatar today are those who will be bringing us the conclusions of Group C and Group D tomorrow. At 3pm GMT on Wednesday France face Tunisia, knowing that the defending champions have already secured a berth in the last 16. Didier Deschamps is expected to make changes, including possible resting Kylian Mbapp\u00e9. Deschamps told the media \u201cPhysically he is very well. Does he want to play? You guys don\u2019t know but I know. He\u2019s part of a collective project and of course he has this capacity to be in the limelight because he\u2019s decisive but he\u2019s not 18 anymore. Generally speaking, all the players want to play but they cannot all start.\u201d  The French coach, who is bidding to lead his nation to the first back-to-back World Cup victories since 1962, said he was not taking the Tunisia game lightly, despite France sitting on top of the group. \u201cThe momentum comes with results. The fact that we\u2019re already through like Brazil and Portugal gives us a bit of leeway but we are not going to be relaxed. The team who will play tomorrow will do everything to get the best possible result, even if I have this possibility to shuffle things around.\u201d     10.31am    Jonathan Liew is in Doha for the Guardian, and writes for us on the conundrum that is the gulf between Harry Maguire for Manchester United, and Harry Maguire for England at tournaments: In many ways, the bomb threat [aimed at Maguire\u2019s home and family] was perhaps the logical culmination of what we might describe as English football\u2019s Maguire-industrial complex: an industry that grew up around his towering performances in the 2018 World Cup before juddering violently in the other direction. Just as Maguire became the face and the forehead of a new, humbler and more relatable England side, so he would become the face and flailing limbs of their regression, the emblem of a United team struggling to define their identity under four successive managers. Why Maguire? There were other flatlining players around him, and yet nobody \u2013 as far as we know \u2013 ever sent a bomb threat to Paul Pogba or threatened to kill the family of John Stones. Perhaps, on some level, the same qualities that fleetingly made Maguire a cult hero also made him a target: his visibility and thinly veiled eagerness, his willingness to put himself out there, to keep trying things, to keep volunteering for post-match interview duties. If you\u2019re angry enough to swing a punch, you\u2019re probably just going to punch the first face you see. Read more here: Jonathan Liew \u2013 Familiar faces and vibes: tournament life is a better fit for Harry Maguire      10.26am    Our community team are interested in your experiences if you are out in Qatar at the moment. Are you enjoying the tournament? Is it different to what you expected? Has it confounded or reinforced any of your ideas about Qatar or the World Cup? You can get in touch here: Football fans in Qatar \u2013 what is your experience of this World Cup?      10.08am    In non-World Cup football news, Kolo Tour\u00e9 has been appointed as the new manager of Championship club Wigan in England.      10.05am   Group B: What do England, Iran, the US and Wales need to do to qualify?  Here is how each of the four teams in Group B can still reach the last 16 of the World Cup:  England: A win against Wales will see England top the group. A draw will qualify them. In fact, England will progress with any result except for a heavy defeat to Wales by more than three goals. Iran: Currently second in the group, a win against the US will put Iran through to the World Cup second round for the first time in their history. A draw against the US will also be enough for them, provided Wales fail to beat England. US: The US must beat Iran to qualify. That\u2019s it. Wales: Wales must beat England and hope that Iran and the US draw. If the US v Iran match ends with a winner, then Wales must beat England by four goals or more.      10.03am   Group A: What do the Netherlands, Ecuador and Senegal need to do to qualify?  Here is how each of the three teams in contention in Group A can reach the last 16 of the World Cup:  The Netherlands: A draw will be enough against Qatar for qualification. Ecuador: Ecuador need just a draw against Senegal to progress. Senegal: Senegal must beat Ecuador to overhaul them. There is a mathematical possibility that Senegal could qualify with a draw if the Netherlands suffer a heavy defeat against Qatar, but this isn\u2019t 1978, and that isn\u2019t going to happen.  If both Ecuador and the Netherlands win, then the margin of victory and number of goals scored will determine who tops the group. If they both win by the same score today, they will end up with identical records, and who finishes first will be determined by their disciplinary records. The Netherlands\u2019 is currently better, with just one yellow card to Ecuador\u2019s three. If those end up level, Fifa draw lots to see who plays in which second round match.     9.33am    One of the subplots in that high energy 3-3 draw between Cameroon and Serbia on Monday was the non-appearance of Cameroon\u2019s first-choice goalkeeper Andre Onana. Onana was marked as \u201cabsent\u201d on the team sheet, with head coach Rigobert Song saying he had to \u201cput the team first ahead of an individual\u201d amid reports of a falling out over tactics. The Cameroon football association has now, according to Reuters reports, formally suspended Onana. It quotes a statement from Fecafoot saying:  The Cameroon football federation hereby informs the public that following Rigobert Song Bahanag\u2019s decision, head coach of the Indomitable Lions, the player Andre Onana has been temporarily suspended from the group for disciplinary reasons. The Cameroon football federation reiterates its full support to the head coach and his entire staff as they implement the federation\u2019s policy aimed at preserving discipline, solidarity, complementarity and cohesion within the national team. Fecafoot further reaffirms its commitment to create a peaceful atmosphere for the team and to provide them with adequate facilities for an outstanding performance.      9.15am    The last time that the US and Iran played each other at a World Cup was in Lyon at France 98. The two teams posed together for a group photograph before the match, which Iran went on to win 2-1.  With the tone of pre-match comments out of Carlos Queiroz ahead of today\u2019s clash, at the moment it is difficult to imagine such scenes being repeated.      9.01am    It became clear towards the end of that Portugal and Uruguay match yesterday that I don\u2019t really understand the handball rule any more, and I probably am not alone. Chief VAR nerd Dale Johnson at ESPN was 100% convinced it should not have been a penalty against Jose Maria Gimenez in the 89th minute on Monday. He writes:  The IFAB stripped back the handball last year, removing much of the wording to make it less complicated. But with it came a long presentation to set out when a player should not be penalised for handball \u2013 even if their arm is away from the body. One of those specific examples covers when \u201carm position is for support when falling or when getting up from the ground.\u201d It doesn\u2019t matter if the ball hits the hand before it touches the ground. Gimenez is very clearly using his left arm for support as he falls to challenge Fernandes, and this has to be covered by the exception. It is almost identical to the example the IFAB issued.  My old school view is that, sure I get all that, but Bruno Fernandes had clearly got himself through on goal if it doesn\u2019t hit the hand, so surely it has to be a penalty, whether Gimenez meant it or not, was in a natural position or not? But one thing I do know is that there would have been a lot of people enjoying watching Uruguay protesting about a last minute handball penalty at a World Cup, that is for sure.      8.45am    Socceroos coach Graham Arnold has put in an early bid for quote of the day, branding social media as \u201call that shite\u201d.  He told the press in Qatar \u201cIf there\u2019s one thing I learned at the Olympics, it was after a big win against Argentina, there was too much celebration. And that celebration, I\u2019m sorry, is social media. \u201cThey get on that until four or five in the morning, watch all the great comments and enjoy all that shite, if I can say that. \u201cIt affects players, it affects their sleep patterns \u2026 it\u2019s killing us. Just get rid of it and don\u2019t look at it.\u201d  In a comment that I would rate a seven out of 10, Arnold said \u201cI am really glad I played in the days when there was no mobile telephones and no journos giving you ratings out of 10 and things like that. \u201cIt\u2019s a big thing \u2026 I think players these days are so mentally strong because of that. \u201cBut at the end of the day, I have to get my wife off social media, I have to get my kids off social media, because it nearly kills them in this time and environment. But that\u2019s the way it is now.\u201d     8.38am    Also having his say this morning is former England international John Barnes, who has written in the Times that everybody should lay off knocking Qatar and respect the progress they\u2019ve made. The former Liverpool and Watford man, who has previously worked for Qatari broadcasters, writes:  The vitriol and disdain towards Qatar as the tournament approached has been laughable. You would have thought the tournament had been awarded to the country a few months ago. It\u2019s the same debate that was had ten years ago. Since Qatar was awarded the tournament, things have changed, and progress has been made on the human rights of migrant workers. While there is still a long way to go, the situation is streets ahead of where they were ten years ago \u2013 with improvements in housing, facilities and wages.  Striking a note somewhat similar to the \u201cYet you participate in society! Curious!\u201d man in that \u201cWe should improve society somewhat\u201d meme, he also says:  It\u2019s interesting to observe that some of those who are making a lot of noise now have had little to say about the development of Qatar over the previous 20 years.  However, he does make this point in the opening of his column, which will have confused \u201canti-woke\u201d readers about just whose side he is on:  How would we like it if African TV stations, pundits and journalists came to a World Cup in England and highlighted injustices towards black people, the lack of black managers, abuse of black players, and worse, the treatment of black people in the inner cities by the authorities? How would we like it if they demanded change and made calls to boycott matches, and for the World Cup to be taken off England, while residing at our top hotels and eating at our finest restaurants? How dare they?! So while discrimination is enshrined in Qatari law, discrimination is also enshrined in British society and culture. Lots of black people are stopped, searched and detained just because they are black. Let\u2019s sort ourselves out before we start to lecture and preach to the rest of the world.       8.30am    We have some words today from Elis James, who is writing on how Wales must play with the handbrake off to earn an overdue win against old foes England: After the 1-1 draw with the USA in the opening game, fans hoped for a repeat of Euro 2020: a nervy stalemate in the first match against Switzerland followed by Bale and Ramsey rolling back the years to outclass Turkey and see us reach the last 16; Gareth and Aaron adding to the evidence that there are in fact two real Princes of Wales. We were all to be disappointed. A deserved win for Iran as a lacklustre Wales cracked in the final two minutes of stoppage time. Even a victory in the final group game may not be enough. And so, on to England. Many, if not most, of our fans were disappointed when we were drawn in the same group as our nextdoor neighbours. If the European Championship is about big international derbies and the continent\u2019s heavyweights being pitted against each other, part of the World Cup\u2019s allure is new teams, strange fixtures, different experiences, something that can\u2019t be provided by the familiarity of Luke Shaw and Mason Mount. Before last Monday night the only competitive games Wales had played against non\u2011European opposition were against Mexico and Brazil in 1958. Declan Rice was not part of the plan in this global festival of football. Read more here: Elis James \u2013 Wales must play with handbrake off to earn overdue win against old foes England      8.21am    If you missed it overnight, Max and the gang were hard at work to produce another daily World Cup episode of Football Weekly, in which they discuss the extraordinary clashes between South Korea and Ghana, and then between Serbia and Cameroon, as well as the qualification of Portugal and Brazil, and preview today\u2019s matches as well. You can get that in your ears here: Aboubakar scoop and Kudus strike add to World Cup goalfest \u2013 Football Daily      8.17am   Preamble  It is positively whizzing past, isn\u2019t it? It is only day ten of this World Cup like no other, and already we are at the sharp end of the group stages. By close of play tonight, eight teams will have \u201cplayed three\u201d next to their names, and four of them will be going home. Well, let us be honest, three of them will be going home, and Qatar will just be sat glumly in the corner of their own party. There are four matches ahead. At 3pm GMT it is Netherlands v Qatar, and Ecuador v Senegal in Group A. Get your second screens ready. Draws will suffice for the Netherlands and Ecuador, a win is a must for Senegal. Group B concludes at 7pm GMT. England must avoid a four goal defeat to Wales to progress. Wales must beat England by any score, and hope that the highly charged meeting between the US and Iran ends up in a highly charged draw. A win for either of the US or Iran will see them through. I\u2019m Martin Belam, and I\u2019ll be bringing you all the buildup during the day, plus the media quotes from the teams in Group C and Group D who will be playing tomorrow, and all the other World Cup news, on and off the field, as it happens.

                    "body": "It\u2019s coming home, it\u2019s coming home \u2026 You know how it goes. Hang on, though: it came home, didn\u2019t it? In July, when the Lionesses beat Germany with a dramatic extra-time winner at Wembley to win Euro 2022. It was England\u2019s first major trophy since Bobby Moore, Jack and Bobby Charlton, Nobby Stiles, Gordon Banks, Geoff Hurst etc won the World Cup in 1966. With all those years of hurt finally over, David Baddiel said he was happy for his song, Three Lions, to be \u201cput to bed\u201d. Guess what, though: it just got up again, for the World Cup in Qatar, and for Christmas. We will come to the new version \u2013 and Qatar \u2013 later. But first, rewind to the summer of 1996 when a wave of Britpop, new laddishness and optimism was washing over the country. The Football Association asked Ian Broudie of the Lightning Seeds to write a song for the European Championship. He came up with a catchy melody and a chantable refrain. The comedians David Baddiel and Frank Skinner, who presented the comedy football TV show Fantasy Football League, wrote lyrics that were yearning and plaintive and hopeful about what it was like to be an England fan. \u201cIt\u2019s coming home\u201d referred to the fact that this was the first major international football competition to be held in the UK since 1966, and also to the hope that success and glory might return. The fans adopted the song and took it to heart. When England beat Scotland in the group stages, it echoed around (the old) Wembley Stadium: \u201cI have never been somewhere where something so spontaneous \u2013 this is our song, the people\u2019s thing \u2013 happens. It felt amazing,\u201d says Baddiel. Baddiel, Skinner and Broudie, a little less fresh of face but perhaps wiser inside, have come to the Guardian\u2019s offices to talk about the song that never went away. \u201cI\u2019ll let them do most of the talking,\u201d says Broudie, gently. \u201cThey\u2019re good with words.\u201d He sits, looking on wryly through his sunnies, occasionally chipping in almost apologetically but \u2026 well, wisely. \u201cThere\u2019s a little bit of community when you\u2019re all singing: \u2018It\u2019s coming home.\u2019\u201d Baddiel and Skinner are good with words. They josh and rib \u2013 at times it is as if those years have melted away and they are back on that Fantasy Football League sofa, a set that transplanted their home life (they shared a flat at the time) to television. Good times. \u201cI\u2019m not much of a looker-backer, but I would say, for me, that was pomp,\u201d says Skinner. \u201cI was red hot in 1996.\u201d  I wonder if there is anything they look back at less fondly, that makes them wince? \u201cAre you talking about Jason Lee?\u201d asks Baddiel. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t make me wince, it makes me ashamed,\u201d says Skinner. On their show, they repeatedly ridiculed the Nottingham Forest player Jason Lee\u2019s hairstyle; in some sketches, Baddiel appeared in blackface. It was, they admit, inexcusable, sustained, ugly, racist bullying. I\u2019m not going to go into it massively here: Skinner has talked about it frankly and extensively in a recent Guardian interview; Baddiel has a programme about antisemitism on Channel 4 on Monday in which he addresses his own racist transgressions by visiting Lee to listen and to apologise.  \u201cIt happened because we used to dress up as cartoons of footballers all the time, and we didn\u2019t think how that is different when you are impersonating a black person. That was bad and mistaken,\u201d says Baddiel. \u201cWe fucked up. We have had conversations about how it happened; I certainly don\u2019t want to defend it in any way,\u201d says Skinner.  By writing an England football song, were they somehow associating with the darker underbelly of hooliganism and nationalism? Skinner reckons the opposite. \u201cI think 96, that song and \u2013 strangely \u2013 the cross of St George seemed to bring less menace than the union jack. Maybe it\u2019s because I\u2019m Catholic. That was the first time it felt more family. I\u2019m not saying it can\u2019t all go off at games \u2013 I was at the final of the men\u2019s Euros last year \u2013 but there was no one chanting \u2018No surrender to the IRA\u2019 or stuff like that. That rightwing thing seemed to go in 96.\u201d Baddiel agrees. \u201cBecause of things that have happened since, like Brexit and the hardening of the far right, it might look different now. But, at the time, the music and the vulnerability of the lyrics meant people were singing a song that was patriotic, yearning after this idea of England that was not nationalist or aggressive. It was a song about losing. As a result, the singing of it and waving of flags felt to me like a type of gentle non-aggressive patriotism.\u201d Of course, England lost to Germany on penalties in 1996. But the dream lived on. \u201cSeventeen years of hurt never stopped us dreaming; Labour\u2019s coming home,\u201d Tony Blair told his party\u2019s conference that autumn before a landslide new dawn in the spring. At the last World Cup, Croatia\u2019s captain, Luka Modri\u0107, said his team had found the refrain disrespectful, but used that to motivate them to win the game and send England home. \u201cI\u2019m just happy that Modri\u0107 knows our song,\u201d says Skinner. \u201cBut we are making an enormous fuss about whether this is a jingoistic, arrogant thing. I think England can describe itself as being the home of football historically. The game we know, the first league, first cup competition, the rules, the first football association were all formed in England. That\u2019s history \u2013 it doesn\u2019t give you ownership.\u201d Broudie gets a word in: \u201cIf the Olympics went to Greece and they said it was coming home, I don\u2019t think anyone would have a problem.\u201d Skinner reminds us that Greece did host the Olympics \u2013 they went home in 2004, and no one had a problem with it. Baddiel: \u201cAlthough I did a documentary \u2026\u201d Skinner: \u201cOh, you\u2019ve done a documentary about everything \u2026\u201d Baddiel: \u201cI have. It was called David Baddiel on the Silk Road, in which people say they invented football.\u201d Skinner: \u201cThat\u2019s a different argument \u2013 stories about people kicking a pig\u2019s bladder around \u2026\u201d OK, whatever: the song certainly came home and stayed home. Over a quarter of century, it wormed its way into the nation\u2019s consciousness, lying dormant for most of the time, but then breaking out for the competitions, most recently \u2013 and most joyously \u2013 at the Women\u2019s Euro 2022. \u201cIt\u2019s coming home, it\u2019s coming home \u2026\u201d chanted a new, maybe (even) nicer generation of England fans in the place it all began. Manager Sarina Wiegman\u2019s post-final press conference was interrupted by a spontaneous victory conga of singing, dancing Lionesses. \u201cIt\u2019s what they naturally turned to,\u201d says Baddiel, proudly. \u201cNot Sweet Caroline but Football\u2019s Coming Home, to sing in that moment of joy.\u201d *** It\u2019s that moment of joy that kicks off the video for the new version, Three Lions (It\u2019s Coming Home for Christmas). \u201cI\u2019ll be honest, I had to slightly be convinced about doing it,\u201d says Baddiel. Skinner: \u201cI would say I dragged Dave kicking and screaming.\u201d Baddiel: \u201cMy son said, \u2018If you do this I\u2019ll never speak to you again.\u2019 But I sort of love Christmas. I think it\u2019s partly to do with being Jewish and not celebrating Christmas when I was young.\u201d Skinner: \u201cFor me, to do a football song is regarded as a bit tacky by a lot of people. To do one that is also a Christmas song is a double tackiness. You know in mathematics two negatives make a positive \u2026\u201d Baddiel: \u201cSo it\u2019s classy.\u201d In the video, they are back in the flat \u2013 a younger Skinner and Baddiel on the sofa, a younger Broudie in the kitchen making the tea \u2013 then joined by today\u2019s Broudie! They sing together. \u201cIn that scene where there\u2019s two of me, I keep thinking I\u2019m not that one [the older Broudie], I\u2019m that one [the younger Broudie].\u201d It\u2019s lovely, and moving, a duet between the same person at different stages of his life. Who is at the door? Older Skinner and Baddiel! All right, lads?  The new lyrics acknowledge the Lionesses\u2019 pride, but the hurt for the men. Then comes Baddiel\u2019s verse: When they decided on Qatar / Should have checked VAR Hah! Funny. It\u2019s too hot / And too far What? Really? I mean, it is too hot in Qatar, certainly \u2013 that\u2019s why the World Cup is on now, messing up domestic football seasons \u2013 but are those really the issues? \u201cIt is perhaps not the most extreme denunciation of that particular state,\u201d admits Baddiel. \u201cBut then it is a football song and I think lyrics about modern slavery and persecution of gay people would have been hard to get in.\u201d  The mood drops a little. Baddiel: \u201cWe are holistic people. I can say that if I was asked if I\u2019d take a ticket to this World Cup final, I wouldn\u2019t go. I don\u2019t particularly want to support that state, what it does and what it represents. Broudie: \u201cIn some way it has brought these issues up, and highlighted Fifa corruption.\u201d Baddiel: \u201cAnd it is complicated. That can feel like a get-out, but it is. It was in Russia after they invaded Crimea. The [winter] Olympics were in China; the worst ethnic cleansing in the world at the moment is of the Uyghurs in China.\u201d Skinner engages seriously. \u201cI think on one hand the, \u2018We are more civilised than you approach\u2019 has not always turned out well for this country in history. I am also not a fan of the very patronising: \u2018They don\u2019t know any better \u2013 don\u2019t get involved in the culture.\u2019 \u2018Don\u2019t get involved\u2019 and \u2018it\u2019s their business\u2019 are dangerous. I attended many anti-apartheid events when I was a student. No one said: it\u2019s their culture, we shouldn\u2019t tell them what to do and, eventually, like they say about people in Arab countries, give them 50 years and they\u2019ll be as civilised as us. No one said that about apartheid. They said: \u2018Fucking hell, this needs to end tomorrow.\u2019 So you could argue that you don\u2019t accept it and it does need to end tomorrow and we shouldn\u2019t be there, or you can also be wary about this superior western view of: \u2018We\u2019ll tell you.\u2019\u201d The Lightning Seeds wouldn\u2019t play Qatar; Skinner wouldn\u2019t do a standup gig there, or a David Beckham. \u201cI\u2019ll be honest: if they said, \u2018Come over and be an ambassador for the World Cup,\u2019 I wouldn\u2019t do it.\u201d At least Harry Kane\u2019s going to wear a rainbow armband. Skinner says: \u201cI think Phil Foden before the first game is going to sing [adopting voice of Kermit the Frog], Why are there so many songs about rainbows \u2026 No he isn\u2019t.\u201d \u201cI wondered where that was going,\u201d says Baddiel, jollification returned. No, they don\u2019t wear rainbow armbands in the video. \u201cBut we have two Lionesses in the video, both of whom are gay and out,\u201d says Skinner, referring to Jess Carter and Beth England. \u201cIt is difficult for men\u2019s football to be pointing the finger at homophobia when players are frightened to come out. Women\u2019s football has no problem; I\u2019ve never heard of any of the many out gay female players being abused.\u201d As well as Lionesses, the new video has a kid\u2019s choir and another cameo from hat-trick hero Geoff Hurst, now 80, as Santa, obviously. Jules Rimet\u2019s still gleaming \u2026 at the top of the tree. Maybe it is tacky, but it is also lovely and makes me want to cry a little bit because it is about the passing of time, and survival and still dreaming. There may be a few new lyrics, but it is the same old song, the best football song, and that\u2019s why it is still going. Skinner, Baddiel and Broudie realise that, no matter what else they do \u2013 books, television, records \u2013 this is going to be the one that\u2019s remembered. The thing they will always be best known for will be Three Lions.  Skinner says: \u201cIf I\u2019m desperately trying to establish who I am to someone, it would be my first port of call. If I\u2019m in, say, a pub in Birmingham, it\u2019s no good saying: \u2018Maybe you know my poetry podcast?\u2019\u201d Broudie hasn\u2019t said a lot, but as the man who sowed that seed, wrote the first notes, he can have the last word. He has made some brilliant music, and it used to annoy him that he would probably always be best known for a football song: it\u2019s coming home, it\u2019s coming home \u2026 \u201cI used to think that wasn\u2019t right, but when I look at it calmly and see the musicality of it, how it can be adapted by a brass band or a kids\u2019 choir, I feel in a weird way, maybe it is my finest hour.\u201d"

                    "body": "Abby Dow can still recall every painful detail. It was 9 April and she had broken her right leg in the early stages of England\u2019s game against Wales at Kingsholm. Lying on a stretcher in the tunnel, with her family and friends around her, she thought her World Cup dream was over. \u201cYou always hear the horror stories of that person who was on form and then all of a sudden gets injured and misses out. We\u2019ve been building for this event for five years and \u2018It\u2019s me\u2019 was going through my head.\u201d Even after being transferred to London and placed in the care of a specialist surgeon she still feared the worst, with the World Cup due to kick off on 8 October. \u201cI remember crying in my hospital bed as people broke the news to me that it was extremely unlikely. The surgery involved quite a big operation and the surgeon can\u2019t say: \u2018You\u2019re going to make it.\u2019\u201d  It has required a huge effort effort, therefore, for the 24-year-old Dow not just to be back on her feet but in New Zealand as an active member of the Red Roses squad. At one point she was utilising five different rehabilitation machines, including a bone healing machine and a device to keep her joints moving. \u201cIt was ridiculous,\u201d she says now. \u201cI basically was a machine.\u201d Driving to physio appointments was also impossible, requiring a roster of friends and family members to act as taxi drivers. \u201cThey\u2019ve been dragged through the whole situation with me. Because it was my right leg you obviously had the classic situation of: \u2018Oh, I can\u2019t drive. Could someone drop me off?\u2019 Rehab isn\u2019t just about yourself, it\u2019s about all the people around you.\u201d The pacy Wasps wing also credits the Red Roses\u2019 head physio Emily Ross \u2013 \u201cIf there was a witchdoctor it would be Emily\u201d \u2013 for getting her back ready to play inside six months. \u201cInitially I was told nine months. Then we tried to squeeze it down to six. Now we\u2019re trying to squeeze it down a bit more. For the first two or three months the million dollar question was: \u2018Am I still on track to make it?\u2019 From it being unlikely to very likely and then being selected has made it a very fortunate transition but it\u2019s not been good for my stress levels. \u201cThe only other guy who has had a break like me has been Harlequins\u2019 Will Evans and he got back in eight or nine months. It was really nice to talk to him and understand what this injury was going to be like. I\u2019ve never had a surgery before so to have that support has helped a lot.\u201d All those tough months of intensive rehab and gym work, however, have paid off. Featuring in the opening game against Fiji might be a push but her coaches have been persuaded to take a calculated risk. A flying Dow, as regularly demonstrated in her 24 Tests for England, poses a major threat to any defence if she can hit the ground running.  \u201cThere is a slight plan in pencil that I could be available for the first game. I\u2019m trying to transition out of the strength and conditioning part into actually growing as a rugby player, not just growing a leg. But this is a performance environment. I also need to perform.\u201d Dow, who has been studying mechanical engineering at Imperial College, London, compares the feeling to a looming set of exams \u2013 \u201cThat was the last time I was under this sort of stress and pressure\u201d \u2013 but also yearns for England to tap into the same feelgood female sports vibe enjoyed by the Lionesses in the summer. \u201cIt\u2019s not so much we need to win it because they did it, it\u2019s more \u2018Let\u2019s do it for women\u2019s sport,\u2019\u201d stresses Dow. \u201cLet\u2019s prove that when you give us time and you give us money we can thrive. Hopefully we can go and achieve the same sorts of things they have.\u201d In all kinds of ways she is a winner already."

                    "body": "As the final whistle blew in Wiener Neustadt on Saturday evening England\u2019s players looked a little flat. After goals from Alessia Russo and Nikita Parris secured a 2-0 victory against Austria the Euro 2022 winners did not seem remotely like a team who had just sealed qualification for next summer\u2019s World Cup in Australia and New Zealand. This downbeat demeanour had nothing to do with complacency \u2014 as the Lionesses\u2019 manager Sarina Wiegman says winning \u201cnever\u201d gets boring \u2014 and could not be blamed entirely on the underwhelming venue.  If England \u2014 and Euro 2022 quarter-finalists Austria, too \u2014 deserved better than to play in front of only 2,600 fans in a ground with just two functioning stands, one of which was overshadowed by a giant water slide belonging to the adjacent aqua park, their downbeat body language appeared more about fatigue than disappointment. As outstanding as Wiegman\u2019s side are \u2014 since taking charge a year ago England\u2019s Dutch coach has choreographed 19 wins and two draws in 21 games \u2014 they could surely do with a rest. A team which has scored 108 goals and conceded only five on Wiegman\u2019s watch were back in action a mere 34 days after beating Germany at Wembley to win Euro 2022. On Tuesday the party atmosphere generated by a full house congregated at Stoke for a now academic World Cup qualifier against Luxembourg will doubtless offer an adrenaline boost but England\u2019s biggest enemy in next summer\u2019s World Cup is arguably not the United States, Germany, France, Canada, Spain or Australia but overload. Possibly Wiegman\u2019s biggest concern is that her European champions are segueing into their various domestic seasons \u2014 England\u2019s Women\u2019s Super League kicks off at the weekend \u2014 so soon after a major tournament. As England\u2019s Alex Greenwood said on Saturday there has been no space for a proper holiday this summer. \u201cThere wasn\u2019t much time off at all,\u201d said the 28-year-old Manchester City defender. \u201cThe City girls had five or six days off and then it was straight back to it. \u201cTo be honest, it feels like we\u2019ve just continued playing football. Managing your workload and being sensible are so important, they\u2019re vital. \u201cEverything you do away from the pitch is so, so, important. That goes for everyone but the older you get the more you definitely have to manage your load. I didn\u2019t think that a couple of years ago but it catches up with you.\u201d Indeed, as Wiegman prepares for next month\u2019s showpiece Wembley friendly with the World Cup holders, the United States, the dangers of over-playing may become acute. The imperative to keep key players including Russo \u2014 who scored her ninth goal in 14 senior appearances and appears nailed on as the recently retired Ellen White\u2019s successor at centre-forward \u2014 fresh and fit for next summer dictates squad rotation could become a necessity. Fran Kirby \u2014 absent with an unspecified injury in Austria \u2014 and Lauren Hemp are similarly vital cogs in Wiegman\u2019s attack and the need to manage their game time should allow other forwards including Parris and Ella Toone a chance to remind everyone of their abilities. Toone, a game-changing substitute during Euro 2022 when she scored transformative goals against Spain and Germany, started in Wiener Neustadt and hopes to be one of the first names on Wiegman\u2019s team sheet against the USA in October. \u201cWe\u2019re excited,\u201d said the Manchester United forward. \u201cWe know how good the USA are \u2014 it\u2019s another level up \u2014 and we want to challenge ourselves against the very best teams. We can\u2019t wait to have all the fans back at Wembley, our favourite place, to support us again. But I think we\u2019ve now got a target on our back because we\u2019ve won the Euros.\u201d Toone has found that triumph life-changing. \u201cMore people recognise you walking down the street, which has been mad, but also amazing,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t think we knew how much of an impact winning the tournament would have. This summer\u2019s been very different to previous ones.\u201d When packed crowds chant \u201cTooney\u201d at high volume it can, paradoxically, sound as if they are booing rather than applauding \u2014 the England cricketer Joe Root has a similar problem with his surname \u2014 and the 23-year-old admits it took time to properly tune in to an increasingly familiar soundtrack. \u201cWhen there\u2019s loads of fans it does sound like they\u2019re booing me but I\u2019ve got used to it,\u201d she said. \u201cI now know they\u2019re on my side.\u201d"

It is also understood that QSI believes that now is a good time to invest into the biggest domestic league in world football given the weak pound and in the aftermath of the perceived success of the World Cup.\nAlthough Spurs are QSI\u2019s first priority, it is thought that at least two other consortiums are also interested in acquiring a stake in the club, which has debts of hundreds of millions of pounds after the construction of their new stadium.\nSpurs have been approached for comment."

                    "body": "England suffered the first setback of their tour of Australia on Monday when Reece Topley tripped on the boundary advertising cushions at the Gabba during a fielding drill and turned an ankle, making him a serious doubt for the T20 World Cup opener against Afghanistan on Saturday. The 28-year-old wore a protective boot on his left foot as he left Brisbane with the rest of the squad on Monday morning to travel to Perth, where they play their opening game. He will be closely monitored over the next couple of days, with no training scheduled until Thursday.  Topley has had a sensational few months in the format, having returned to the England side in January after nearly six years when a weakened squad without any of its multi-format players travelled to Barbados. The 6ft 7in left-armer was considered very likely to be in Saturday\u2019s XI, having as played 16 matches since his recall. He is England\u2019s leading wicket-taker this year with 17, while his economy rate of 7.80 since is bettered only by Mark Wood, Chris Woakes, Ben Stokes and Liam Dawson, all of whom have played five or fewer T20 internationals in 2022. Should Topley\u2019s injury be significant enough to rule him out of the tournament, England have two seam bowlers among their three travelling reserves in Tymal Mills and Richard Gleeson, who could join the playing group if required. England completed their World Cup preparations with a warm-up game against Pakistan on Monday, which they won by six wickets, but though reserves were permitted to play in that match. England chose not to use them. Mills and Gleeson have both taken full part in net sessions but neither is exactly match-honed: Gleeson played in two of England\u2019s seven games on last month\u2019s tour of Pakistan, while Mills has only played twice since June, most recently on 10 August. Most of the squad, however, will appreciate a day and a half at leisure in Perth after what has been a hectic period of preparation. \u201cWe\u2019ve played a lot and we\u2019re definitely ready now,\u201d Sam Curran said. \u201cWe feel like we\u2019re playing good cricket. Winning is a habit but at the same time, we\u2019ve seen some of the results already at the World Cup. It\u2019s a T20 format, anything can happen but we\u2019re confident we\u2019ve got a group of players who are really powerful and skilful in those different scenarios that we might face. It\u2019s fair to say we\u2019re really excited, hopefully we\u2019ll have a couple of good training sessions in Perth and come the weekend we\u2019ll be good.\u201d Monday\u2019s match saw both a player sustaining a new ankle injury and a player returning from an old one, with Liam Livingstone bowling and batting on his first appearance since August. \u201cIt was great to have a game like that for Liam, who\u2019s been out for a while,\u201d Curran said. \u201cThat type of game was almost perfect to get him back in and the fact he hit some balls out in the middle and bowled really nicely as well was great.\u201d Across Brisbane at Allan Border Field, Afghanistan also had a convincing warm-up win on Monday, beating Bangladesh by 62 runs. They will conclude their own preparations with a final practice game, against Pakistan on Wednesday, before travelling to Perth but their buildup to the tournament has contrasted with England, who had played 10 competitive matches against Pakistan and Australia before arriving in Brisbane whereas their first World Cup opponents had not played since early September. \u201cI think you\u2019d definitely rather be playing,\u201d Curran said. \u201cI guess you get that confidence, especially if you\u2019re winning. But Afghanistan are extremely skilful, they\u2019ve got world-class players who can win you games by themselves. They\u2019ve got some entertaining, world-class spinners, we know that, and they\u2019ve got some very powerful batters up top. We\u2019ll be doing our research and our plans but we know it\u2019s going to be a really tough opening game.\u201d"

                    "body": "US soccer has many forces acting against its success. The country shunned the sport after the 1930s, leaving a men\u2019s national team withering and winless. Even after years of progress, soccer lags behind indigenous sports in a crowded marketplace. Add one more powerful force to that list. Entitlement. Also add its close cousin, snowplow parenting, a term referring to those parents who knock down any obstacle standing in front of their kids. The obstacle du jour is Gregg Berhalter, the once and possibly future men\u2019s national team head coach. The parents are Hall of Fame player Claudio Reyna and his wife, Danielle, a roommate and teammate of Berhalter\u2019s wife at the University of North Carolina\u2019s storied women\u2019s soccer program.  And the child, though he\u2019s 20 years old, is Gio Reyna, the Borussia Dortmund attacker who sulked for a few days after Berhalter told him he\u2019d have a limited role at the World Cup. Reyna did come around eventually, and he played the second half when the US were eliminated from the World Cup in a 3-1 loss to the Netherlands. On Tuesday, Berhalter released a statement admitting he had kicked his future wife\u2019s legs in an alcohol-fueled argument in 1991, when they were both UNC student-athletes. He added these startling words: \u201cDuring the World Cup, an individual contacted US Soccer, saying they had information about me that would \u2018take me down.\u2019\u201d To the surprise of absolutely no one, the Reyna family admitted on Wednesday that they had told the federation about the 31-year-old incident, though they denied making any sort of threat. They had opportunity, given that Claudio Reyna and Berhalter were national teammates of the USSF sporting director, Earnie Stewart, and the US men\u2019s general manager, Brian McBride. And they had motive, given not only Gio Reyna\u2019s scant playing time but also Berhalter\u2019s comments at a 6 December conference on moral leadership, in which he said he nearly expelled a player during the World Cup before reconciling. The contents of that conference were not intended to be made public. Nor did Berhalter name the player in question. And yet Gio Reyna all but confirmed the next day that he was said player, and Danielle Reyna confirmed on Wednesday that the comments motivated her to reveal the 1991 Berhalter incident, which she says was worse than Berhalter is letting on. On Tuesday, the same day Berhalter released his statement, US Soccer alerted the public, saying they hired outside investigators as soon as they learned of the incident, on 11 December. That investigation has since morphed: \u201cThrough this process, US Soccer has learned about potential inappropriate behavior towards multiple members of our staff by individuals outside of our organization.\u201d Beleaguered US Soccer officials, already accustomed to being either the referee, the instigator or the instigated in controversies big and small, declined on a Wednesday conference call to give more detail. In short: the Reynas said nothing about a physical fight between Berhalter and his future wife for more than three decades but mentioned it to US Soccer officials after learning that Berhalter had mentioned in a private conference that he had since-resolved issues with a player he didn\u2019t identify who got scant playing time for most of the World Cup. In other words, the Reynas acted like typical soccer parents in the US.  Every youth soccer parent, coach and referee knows these parents. They\u2019re the ones who gush about their kid\u2019s new youth club in August and then rant against it when they leave in May. They\u2019re the ones who intimidate coaches into substitutions at nearly every stoppage in play, lest a player be left on the sideline longer than a few minutes. They\u2019re the ones who gossip on anonymous message boards to trash coaches and clubs. To be sure, complaints about playing time in sports aren\u2019t exactly breaking news. But if there was a World Cup for such griping, the US would surely have a crowded trophy case. Woe be unto the coach who keeps the wrong player out of the lineup of any team from under-9s to the national teams, men and women. Woe be unto the referee who crosses a women\u2019s national team player who feels emboldened by a sycophantic fanbase not just to argue with referees but to humiliate them.  Woe be unto the youth soccer coach who fails to achieve the sometimes-incompatible goals of winning trophies and developing children into prized players who can earn everything from a spot on the local high school varsity to a professional opportunity. This is, after all, a country in which parents took advantage of preferential college admissions for athletes by fabricating their children\u2019s exploits, part of a series of events exposed under the catch-all title Operation Varsity Blues. It\u2019s also a country in which players grow up and see nothing wrong with taking a staggering 90% of the prize money the men earned in the 2022 World Cup and the women will earn in the 2023 World Cup, all while grassroots organizations seethe at seeing the rich get richer. (At a media teleconference on the agreement, I asked representatives from both teams if they plan on building bridges with those who work with youth and amateurs. Silence.) And it\u2019s a culture that rewards players who don\u2019t think they need to listen to coaches or critics. In women\u2019s soccer, the fanbase has adopted the attitude that players are always right, while coaches, league officials and referees are always wrong. In men\u2019s soccer, players are less immune to criticism but have come up through a youth system that all too often pampered them, perhaps to the detriment of their performance. \u201cAre you going to continue to be a bunch of soft, underperforming, tattooed millionaires?\u201d Alexi Lalas asked in 2017 when the men were teetering on the edge of World Cup qualifying failure.  But ultimately, it comes back to the parents. Not every parent. Not every player. But too many. The investigation of Berhalter and any related business may take months. In the meantime, US Soccer must decide whether to offer Berhalter a new contract or look elsewhere. The federation has already shown it can drag out such decisions for more than a year. And so in dragging down Berhalter, the Reynas may also drag down the federation that Claudio Reyna once represented so well and Gio Reyna may yet do the same. Those who are involved with youth soccer have seen it all before. The ironic aspect of the term \u201csnowplow parent\u201d is that those snowplows leave behind scorched earth. At the heart of the matter here are two families, once closely intertwined, torn apart by an argument over playing time and a player\u2019s attitude. Just like we see in youth soccer every day."

                    "body": "\u201cIf you\u2019re a black player who is a great penalty taker, like Ivan Toney, it will be on your mind,\u201d Rio Ferdinand says as he anticipates the anxiety that may ripple through the England squad which flies to Qatar for the World Cup next week. \u201cIf Toney gets in the squad one of his first actions in the World Cup could be being brought on to take a penalty. There\u2019s no doubt in my mind he\u2019ll be thinking: \u2018Shit, I know what happened to [Bukayo] Saka, [Jadon] Sancho and [Marcus] Rashford.\u2019\u201d Those young black footballers missed penalties in the shootout that secured Italy\u2019s victory over England in the final of the European Championship last year. They suffered sustained racial abuse online in a depressing example of the way in which prejudice is still rife. Ferdinand, who won 81 caps for England and played in two World Cups, has spent the last few years immersed in making a trilogy of films. Two documentaries about racism and sexuality consider how to overcome the bigotry that scars football while the third explores the consequences for mental health in a game which Ferdinand believes has reached a tipping point. The World Cup will feature heavily on social media\u2019s febrile platforms and Ferdinand knows that more hate and prejudice are likely. \u201cThat\u2019s why the rules need to be changed to allow players to feel there aren\u2019t repercussions from a racial standpoint if they fail, or make a mistake,\u201d he says. \u201cBut at the moment the laws aren\u2019t in place to protect players. So I definitely think that will be in the back of players\u2019 minds going into high-pressure World Cup situations. It\u2019s not just England. All players of colour around the world will be thinking that.\u201d  An online safety bill could take another two years to be ratified. In the meantime, as Ferdinand reiterates, social media companies have the means to block and expose racist and homophobic abuse. \u201cThe problem is that they rely on toxic behaviour and hate speech so they won\u2019t quash that element,\u201d he says. \u201cRacism and all forms of discrimination are welcomed on social media because that interaction equals more advertising money. We saw with Covid that if a message needs putting out on social media there are algorithms and technology for these companies to make a difference. But they can\u2019t tackle discrimination. So it shows there is no real intention to change. We spoke to [the social media giants] but you get wishy-washy feedback: \u2018Yeah, we\u2019re trying all we can.\u2019 No, you\u2019re not.\u201d In a powerful section of his documentary on racism, Ferdinand meets technology experts at a data company called Signify and they show him how easy it is to trace abusive messages and to identify the people responsible for those postings. They are even able to pinpoint where such racists live and work. Ferdinand shared some of their findings with the Football Policing Unit and, so far, 12 cases of racist hate crime are being investigated. Signify also suggests that 50% of online racial abuse relating to football is aimed at three players: Raheem Sterling, Wilfried Zaha and Adebayo Akinfenwa, who retired in May. Ferdinand meets Zaha and Akinfenwa and they agree to join a WhatsApp group of socially conscious footballers he formed with Romelu Lukaku. Ferdinand is emphatic that, as shown by the ability of NBA stars such as LeBron James and Chris Paul to confront racism in the US, the real power lies with current players who have the fame and social media followings to force governing bodies to take action.  \u201cMore than just highlighting the issues again we wanted to make a solution-based documentary,\u201d Ferdinand says. \u201cI\u2019m not stupid enough to think a documentary is going to end these issues. But the fact we\u2019ve been in parliament lobbying and we\u2019re now going to board meetings at the Premier League means we\u2019re at those decision-making tables, bringing current players and ex-players together to talk.\u201d Ferdinand meets Richard Masters, the Premier League\u2019s chief executive, to stress that occasional campaigns and statements of support are not enough to combat bigotry in football. \u201cBy the time the documentaries are available I will have been at a Premier League board meeting to discuss these issues. The ball\u2019s rolling now but it\u2019s not about me. I want to kick that door open and say \u2018come on\u2019 to the current players because they know the problems. They\u2019re living and breathing them every day. So they need to be heard.\u201d Does Masters share Ferdinand\u2019s desire to involve current players in the battle against racism? \u201cThe fact that he\u2019s invited me to the board meeting is a step in the right direction. But he needs to prove himself. Far too often we\u2019ve had people in these positions engage in tokenism and box-ticking exercises. I hope he and the Premier League are true to their word.\u201d Ferdinand is in close communication about racism with \u201cover 50 current players from around Europe and England. We are going to the stakeholders within the game to discuss meaningful action\u201d. Sexuality is an area in which Ferdinand is less familiar when campaigning against prejudice. He should be commended, however, for facing up to his own past homophobia. In the second documentary he visits his sister, Remi, who is gay, and he plays her an audio clip in which he is heard using homophobic language during a 2006 interview with Chris Moyles. A reminder of that embarrassing behaviour had been sent to Ferdinand when, on Twitter, he asked why no Premier League footballer has ever come out as gay. \u201cThat [interview] was done so long ago and culture and language is very different now,\u201d he says. \u201cYes, it was an awkward scene to shoot but my sister obviously knows how genuine I am around sexuality. She recognises the strides I\u2019ve made since she told me and my brother, Anton, and our dad, how hard she found it to hear some of the language used when we were growing up. So it was difficult for me to admit it but that vulnerability probably makes other people think: \u2018That was me as well.\u2019 It shows a way out to the other side [of homophobia] as long as you educate yourself and have empathy.\u201d  In another revealing moment Ferdinand asks whether it is acceptable to participate in \u201cbanter\u201d, which borders on homophobia, in straight company. He quickly shuts down the suggestion as totally unacceptable. \u201cIt\u2019s mad to even ask,\u201d he says now. \u201cIf you asked the same question to do with race, you know it\u2019s not right. Flip it to sexuality and why is it different? So for me this is definitely a learning experience.\u201d As part of that education process Ferdinand meets gay footballers at grassroots level, including players for Stonewall FC, as well as Collin Martin, in America, and Josh Cavallo in Australia. Alongside Jake Daniels, the teenager on Blackpool\u2019s books, Martin and Cavallo are among the very few openly gay professionals currently playing in men\u2019s football. Two years ago Landon Donovan, the former US international who manages San Diego Loyal, led his team off the pitch after Martin had been subjected to a homophobic slur. Ferdinand contrasts the praise Donovan received for standing up to prejudice with the fate of Darren Wildman, the academy head at Skelmersdale United in the Northern Premier League. \u201cDarren was at the low end of the pyramid as a coach and one of his players was abused about his sexuality. Homophobic words were said and Darren took his players off the pitch. He reported it to the referee but the other team wasn\u2019t happy and all of a sudden his life changed because he was getting abuse. The FA then made him feel like he was the perpetrator when he was actually trying to protect his team and an individual player. He got banned and fined for abandoning the game. It\u2019s unbelievable. When we saw him he was like a broken man.\u201d Wildman was told on Twitter that he should have been \u201cgassed like the Jews\u201d as antisemitism merged with homophobia. \u201cLook at Landon Donovan who was put up in lights, rightly so, for the way he handled the same situation,\u201d Ferdinand says. \u201cIt was amazing to see his team walk off the pitch \u2013 but such a difference to what happened here.\u201d  What advice would Ferdinand offer if a gay Premier League footballer told him privately he was considering coming out? \u201cI would say it very much depends on the network of people around you. A strong core of people can alleviate some of the pressure. It\u2019s going to be difficult, and hard, but the experiences [of coming out] I\u2019ve heard are very positive. I would say you will gain a lot but be prepared for it to be tough.\u201d It\u2019s obvious why there are so many mental health issues surrounding football \u2013 particularly among young players released by professional academies. Eighty per cent of those discarded players develop depression and Ferdinand explains that of the 1.5 million boys who play representative youth football in England, only 180 make it to the Premier League. He describes the 0.012% rate as \u201ccrazy\u201d and acknowledges the struggle his two teenage sons, who are at Brighton\u2019s academy, face in their quest to play elite level football. Ferdinand also meets some of his former West Ham academy teammates who were not lucky enough to match his success. \u201cLee Boylan is the one that stands out for me,\u201d the 44-year-old says. \u201cHe played in the same team at West Ham as me and Frank Lampard. He was our top goalscorer in a youth team that won the league two years on the bounce. In the small town in Essex where he grew up he was a mini-superstar. But Lee didn\u2019t make the first team at West Ham. He slips into depression, with massive anxiety, and breaks down. He never really recovers and you can see he\u2019s still really scarred from that experience.\u201d Ferdinand invites all the leading academies to a forum to discuss how to deal with mental health problems among young players and he is disappointed when only four clubs attend. \u201cThey are very guarded around the media. But the subject matter should have overridden all of that.\u201d Each one of Ferdinand\u2019s three documentaries faced the same problem. Whether trying to get footballers, their agents or clubs to discuss racism, sexuality and mental health, even a former player as famous as Ferdinand struggled to engender open conversations. \u201cTrying to penetrate the ecosystem of football was so difficult. Even with my background in football, you could still see doors closing and people unwilling to talk. Agents getting in the way or players not wanting to talk because they have been on the receiving end of these issues. I was thinking; \u2018What the hell? Why would you not want to be part of a process that is not just about highlighting the issue but trying to find solutions?\u2019 \u201cZaha, Lukaku and Akinfenwa have had so much prejudice thrown at them. But they listened and asked good questions. As soon as they heard we were looking for solutions they wanted to be part of it. But there weren\u2019t enough brave people like that.\u201d Rio Ferdinand\u2019s Tipping Point is available on Prime Video on Friday 11 November"

                    "body": "Reece James has been ruled out for eight weeks with a knee injury, leaving the Chelsea and England wing-back\u2019s hopes of going to the World Cup hanging by a thread. James went off during Chelsea\u2019s 2-0 win over Milan at San Siro last Tuesday and the initial signs were that he had not suffered serious damage. However the 22-year-old received bad news after undergoing further tests on Thursday and is expected to be out for a significant period.  James visited a consultant on Saturday and the decision has been taken for him not to have surgery. But the right-sided player, who has been in outstanding form for club and country this season, still looks highly unlikely to go to Qatar. England\u2019s opening group game is against Iran on 21 November. The fact James stayed in Milan for an extra day and flew back to England on an easyJet flight on Wednesday night suggests he was not worried about the injury at first. He paid for extra legroom and it is understood that taking a budget flight did not cause any further damage. But James is still facing up to the prospect of not going to the World Cup. Losing him would be a major blow for Gareth Southgate, who finds himself with a selection headache on the right of his defence. Manchester City\u2019s Kyle Walker, who can play at right centre-back and right back, is a major doubt after undergoing groin surgery, and Liverpool\u2019s Trent Alexander-Arnold has an ankle problem. As it stands Kieran Trippier would be in line to start on the right against Iran. The hope for James will be that he is able to prove he will be fit in time for the knockout stage. Having a 26-man squad gives Southgate extra wriggle room with injuries. Southgate took Harry Maguire to Euro 2020 despite him being injured for England\u2019s first two games. James\u2019s absence is also a blow for Chelsea, who visit Aston Villa on Sunday. Graham Potter\u2019s side have also lost N\u2019Golo Kant\u00e9 and Wesley Fofana to injury. A hamstring injury is set to keep Kante out for the rest of the year, meaning that the France international is out of the World Cup. France are also likely to be out without Fofana. The \u00a369.5m defender suffered a knee injury against Milan earlier this month. In better news for Chelsea, Mason Mount is expected to be available against Villa after a scan on a thigh problem revealed nothing serious. "

                    "body": "On the plane It is inconceivable that Jordan Pickford will not be England\u2019s No 1 despite missing the latest camp with a thigh injury. Gareth Southgate is loyal to his senior players and often prefers to go with the tried and trusted. The manager has repeatedly backed Harry Maguire, even after the centre\u2011back blundered during the 3-3 draw with Germany on Tuesday, and is past the point of experimentation. He values experience and wants leaders like Kyle Walker and Kieran Trippier around. Both are familiar with Southgate\u2019s back three, as is a resurgent Eric Dier, while Reece James\u2019s occasional defensive wobbles are cancelled out by the thrust he offers from right wing\u2011back.  On the opposite flank Luke Shaw, who was a doubt after losing his place at Manchester United, has surely played his way back in after impressing against Germany. In midfield Declan Rice is a guaranteed starter, while Jude Bellingham banished any concerns over his inexperience with a fabulous display against Germany. Jordan Henderson is certain to make the cut if he stays clear of injury and there will always be space for Mason Mount because of his work off the ball, which is enough to make managers stick with the Chelsea midfielder even when he is not playing well. Southgate loved Mount\u2019s goalscoring cameo against Germany. He finished brilliantly after coming off the bench and combining with Bukayo Saka, who also sparkled in his substitute appearance. After struggling at left wing-back against Italy, Saka shone on the right wing at Wembley and is a contender to start, though England are not short of creative options. Phil Foden is too gifted to miss out, for all that he needs to become more decisive, and although Southgate tends to see Jack Grealish as more of an impact player than a regular starter the Manchester City winger is more than capable of making chances for the side\u2019s two main finishers, Harry Kane and Raheem Sterling.  In the departure lounge Nick Pope\u2019s kicking is a concern and he gave away a soft goal against Germany, but the Newcastle goalkeeper appears to have established himself as Pickford\u2019s deputy following two consecutive starts. Arsenal\u2019s Aaron Ramsdale will probably have to content himself with being third choice, even though his form is good and his distribution is vastly superior to Pope\u2019s. At this stage it does not feel as if Southgate is about to spring many surprises. Conor Coady is not an exciting name but Southgate loves the Everton centre-back\u2019s sunny demeanour and knows that he is comfortable in a back three. John Stones, who was having a fine game at right centre-back before succumbing to injury against Germany, will go if he is fit. The same applies to Kalvin Phillips. He has been a key player for Southgate, who would find it hugely frustrating if shoulder surgery deprives him of the City midfielder.  Hoping for a ticket James Ward-Prowse would be the likely beneficiary if Phillips misses out. The Southampton midfielder has constantly been on the fringes of the squad and has pushed ahead of Conor Gallagher, who has dropped back into the Under-21 set-up after a difficult start to the season at Chelsea. Perhaps the energetic Gallagher could make a late push if his form improves following Graham Potter\u2019s appointment as Chelsea manager. Similarly Ben Chilwell, who did not get a look-in during the latest camp, will hope that his fortunes improve under Potter. However Southgate has repeatedly overlooked the left-back, who could be a high-profile omission if he continues to struggle for regular starts at Chelsea. A lot can change in two months. Many people would like to see Fikayo Tomori take Maguire\u2019s starting spot but Southgate seems less convinced about the Milan defender. The worry for Tomori will be that he loses out to Crystal Palace\u2019s Marc Gu\u00e9hi, who was on the bench against Germany. As for Nottingham Forest\u2019s Dean Henderson, his hopes surely rest on Pope or Ramsdale getting injured or experiencing dramatic slumps in form. Of course the biggest story would be if Trent Alexander\u2011Arnold, whose club form has been underwhelming, is left out. Does Southgate trust the Liverpool right-back? The evidence suggests otherwise given that he had no minutes during the latest camp and ultimately there is no point selecting the 23\u2011year\u2011old if he is not going to be used, particularly as accommodating four right-backs would probably force Southgate to leave out a forward player. What of those attackers? Jarrod Bowen has been involved in the last two squads but the West Ham winger is off colour and his chance may have passed given that he did not feature against Italy or Germany. Tammy Abraham is yet to demonstrate that he can deputise for Kane and has only scored twice for Roma this season. Ivan Toney has not been fully discounted following his first call-up, but the Brentford striker remains uncapped and will surely be vulnerable if Marcus Rashford recovers from injury and continues his resurgence at United. Rashford should be in if he is fit and firing. He boasts a decent goalscoring record for England, offers more experience than Toney and is more flexible and slippery than Abraham. Watching from the sofa Southgate has not ruled out a return for Jadon Sancho, who looks a better option on the wings than Bowen, but if the United winger\u2019s strong start to the season was not enough this time then the prospect of him making it to Qatar is slim.  Dominic Calvert-Lewin, Ollie Watkins, Callum Wilson and Patrick Bamford look unlikely to make it as Kane\u2019s deputy. Emile Smith Rowe needs to focus on becoming a regular starter for Arsenal and Southgate remains unmoved by James Maddison, even though the Leicester midfielder is one of the most creative players in the Premier League. Sam Johnstone and Fraser Forster are unlikely to make it as the third-choice goalkeeper. Full-backs such as Kyle Walker-Peters, James Justin and Tyrick Mitchell have drifted away. In central defence the ship has sailed for Aston Villa\u2019s Tyrone Mings, while Arsenal\u2019s Ben White has fallen behind Tomori and Gu\u00e9hi. "

                    "body": "This article is part of the Guardian\u2019s World Cup 2022 Experts\u2019 Network, a cooperation between some of the best media organisations from the 32 countries who qualified. theguardian.com is running previews from two countries each day in the run-up to the tournament kicking off on 20 November.\nThe plan\nWhile most nations were busy booking hotel complexes in Doha and entering existential national debates on final squad selection, Australia were still treading the path to qualification. To say that road, which stretched thousands of kilometres across Asia, was a long one would be an understatement \u2013 Graham Arnold\u2019s side played a mammoth 20 qualifiers over 1,008 days before finally sealing their place in Qatar via an intercontinental playoff against Peru in June this year \u2013 after extra time and penalties, of course, just to prolong the journey that bit longer.\nA fifth consecutive appearance at a World Cup ranks as a major feat for a nation where football remains a fringe sport in a competitive domestic market. So too for this squad of players, whose limitations are at times all too evident, despite setting a world record for the most consecutive wins in a single qualification campaign at one point last year. That streak quickly gave way to a run of poor form \u2013 including defeats to Saudi Arabia and Japan (twice), and dropped points against the Saudis, China and Oman \u2013 that resulted in the Socceroos ceding what seemed to be a nailed-on automatic qualification spot, and forced them down the playoff route.\n\nHowever, they arrive in Qatar with the euphoria of that shootout win over Peru still fresh in minds and off the back of wins over New Zealand in their only two outings since. Arnold cut a buoyant figure after the second of those warmup games, joking that he planned to \u201creach out to Panadol for a sponsorship\u201d, such were the selection headaches his players were giving him.\nThat has since been somewhat tempered by injury clouds hanging over a number of players, including the attacking midfielder Ajdin Hrustic, key defender Harry Souttar and winger Martin Boyle, although when confirming the final 26-man squad, Arnold appeared upbeat over all three players\u2019 chances of proving their fitness in time for the opener against France. \n\nThe coach\nGraham Arnold has ridden extreme high and lows \u2013 mostly lows \u2013 since taking over after the 2018 World Cup. In March, the 59-year-old was seemingly facing the sack with the qualifying campaign imploding. By June, once Australia had won two unlikely playoffs, he was being hailed a tactical genius. Arnold\u2019s philosophy has divided opinion for a decade of mostly domestic club management, particularly around his reliance on dead balls and transitional play. But his realism is a strength, and he understands the virtues of deploying players in roles similar to the ones they fill with their respective clubs.\nStar player\nThis Australian vintage may lack a standout star of the calibre of Tim Cahill, Mark Viduka or Harry Kewell but, when on song, Ajdin Hrustic can lay claim to being the Socceroos\u2019 top dog in 2022. The creative midfielder, who poses a goal threat from open play as well as set pieces, was an integral part of the qualification campaign and how he responds to an ankle ligament injury sustained while playing for his club Verona will be key to his country\u2019s hopes in Qatar.\n\nUnsung hero\nJackson Irvine rarely makes headlines \u2013 defensive midfielders rarely do \u2013 but his growing importance to the Socceroos should not be underestimated. The Melbourne-born player greases the wheels of Arnold\u2019s machine from a deep-lying central position, while providing a goal threat from set pieces and late runs into the box. He played a crucial part in the qualification campaign and, having been installed this season as co-captain of St Pauli in Germany, the 29-year-old is becoming a leader on and off the pitch for Australia.\nProbable lineup\n\nQatar stance\nSixteen Australian players released a video at the end of October, raising their concerns over the human rights issues in Qatar. The group \u2013 which included captain Mat Ryan \u2013 became the first collective voice of players to be heard in the build-up to the tournament. Football Australia, which had until that point been relatively silent on the issues, and the players\u2019 union, Professional Footballers Australia, also released statements condemning the suffering of migrant workers and LGBTQ+ people and calling for reform in the country. Arnold has since indicated he expects the focus of his players to be on the pitch in Qatar, saying \u201conce they arrive, it\u2019s all about football. The statement has been made, the players now just need to focus on the game, focus on the football and come here and enjoy this World Cup.\u201d \nNational anthem\nAdvance Australia Fair was published in 1878 by Scotland-born composer Peter Dodds McCormick and first replaced God Save the Queen as the national anthem in 1974 after being preferred to Waltzing Matilda and The Song of Australia in a national survey. The controversial lyrics are divisive though and were finally changed in 2021 to recognise the legacy of Indigenous Australians. The second line now reads \u201cfor we are one and free\u201d instead of \u201cyoung and free\u201d.\nAll-time cult hero\nEver since 16 November 2005, the name of John Aloisi has been indelibly etched into Australian sporting folklore. \u201cHere\u2019s Aloisi for a place in the World Cup \u2026 he\u2019s scored! Australia have done it!\u201d So went the commentary as the big striker\u2019s winning penalty in the playoff shootout against Uruguay sparked bedlam in Sydney and sent the Socceroos to the World Cup for the first time in 32 years. \u201cI still get asked to run around with my top off,\u201d Aloisi wrote 17 years later, soon after another dramatic penalty shootout secured the nation\u2019s latest World Cup qualification and produced a natural heir to Aloisi in the shape of jelly-armed goalkeeper Andrew Redmayne.\nMike Hytner and Emma Kemp write for Guardian Australia.

                    "body": "Qatar is a rich Gulf nation known for both its huge oil reserves and its flagrant human rights abuses. It is a dictatorship in which women have to seek permission from their male guardians to marry or work in many government jobs, in which being gay is criminalised and can result in a prison sentence, in which migrant workers are treated appallingly and in which journalists have been imprisoned for reporting critically on domestic politics. Yet all of this will inevitably be minimised as the world\u2019s eyes fall on Qatar for the start of the 2022 World Cup next month. Qatar\u2019s leaders know this and this is why they have paid through the nose \u2013 estimates put it at $220bn (\u00a3190bn), by far the most expensive World Cup of all time \u2013 to host the competition, including lavishing money on efforts to lobby British politicians, as we report today. And so football teams, international supporters, the world\u2019s media and foreign dignitaries will duly head to Qatar for an international sporting tournament that has serious environmental implications and will, some predict, leave a huge carbon footprint. At a conservative estimate, at least 6,500 migrant workers have lost their lives n Qatar since it was awarded the World Cup in 2011. This World Cup is just the latest in a long line of expensive international sporting events that have been hosted by nations that stand accused of fundamental human rights breaches. The 2008 Summer Olympics and 2022 Winter Olympics in China; the 2014 Winter Olympics in Russia; the Bahrain Grand Prix; the 2019 World Athletics Championships in Qatar; the 2019 Anthony Joshua fight in Saudi Arabia: there is an indisputable trend of big sporting events being hosted by rich but unsavoury countries.  This is the reflection of a number of trends. There is the push factor of dictatorships around the world seeking to launder their reputations through the medium of international sport \u2013 $200bn on a World Cup doesn\u2019t just secure international visitors and sporting entertainment but PR that money normally can\u2019t buy. This is particularly valuable in an age when Gulf states recognise that at some point the oil and gas will run out and so are looking to build other sources of power on the world stage. In response, competitions are more and more expensive to put on, as democracies that have to justify the expense to voters get priced out of the market. The 2006 World Cup in Germany cost just $4.3bn. The levels of financial corruption in international sport \u2013 governing bodies such as Fifa and the International Olympic Committee have been notoriously porous to expensive bribes and shady deals in exchange for votes behind the scenes \u2013 have made things worse. All this means that sporting bureaucrats often face unenviable choices, for example, between Beijing in China and Almaty in Kazakhstan for the 2022 Winter Olympics, which ultimately went to the former, necessitating the manufacture of fake snow out of 49m gallons of water. Sports governing bodies advance the case that awarding competitions to countries with questionable human rights records draws attention and scrutiny to their abuses, encouraging liberalisation. Sebastian Coe, president of the International Association of Athletics Federations, claimed at the 2019 World Athletics Championships in Qatar that sport can uniquely \u201cshine the spotlight on issues\u201d and is \u201cthe best diplomat we have\u201d. But there is little academic evidence of these effects. China\u2019s human rights abuses got worse between the 2009 Summer Olympics and the 2022 Winter Olympics. The same is true of Russia and the 2014 Sochi Olympics. And the 1936 Berlin Olympics were undoubtedly a propaganda coup for the Nazis. Sporting competitions would lead to improvements only if sports bodies were to take a tough approach with host nations, attaching stringent conditions that improve human rights records beyond the period of the competition itself. But they are not, generally, willing to do this. In fact, they are much more likely to equivocate and protest their neutrality over the most dreadful human rights abuses. Thomas Bach, the president of the IOC, when asked what he would say to Chinese Uyghurs forcibly separated from their children and interned in concentration camps, declared on the eve of the 2022 Beijing Olympics: \u201cThe position of the IOC must be to give political neutrality\u2026 if we get in the middle of intentions and disputes and confrontations of political powers, then we are putting the Games at risk.\u201d Could there be anything more morally decrepit than a policy of neutrality on genocide? The problem does not start and stop with sport. In truth, the approach the international sports bodies take to countries such as the Gulf states is just a reflection of international politics. Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates are considered close allies of the UK, with cooperation on security and the fostering of trade links, including arms sales. The RAF even has a joint air force squadron with Qatar; earlier this year Boris Johnson went to Saudi Arabia to meet Mohammed bin Salman despite the fact that his government had arranged for the Saudi journalist Jamal Kashogghi to be murdered in its consulate in Istanbul in 2018. International sporting competitions should not be awarded to governments with appalling human rights records. But this is a line that western political, not just sporting, leadership has proved all too willing to cross. \u2022 This article was amended on 3 November 2022. The 1936 Olympics were held in Berlin, not Munich as an earlier version said. Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

                    "body": "England are into next Saturday\u2019s World Cup final against New Zealand but it required two tries from the pacy Abby Dow to rescue them from the abyss in Auckland. The Red Roses had to cling on at times against a fired-up, physical Canada but battled through to register their 30th successive Test victory and keep alive their hopes of a first world title since 2014.\nIt said everything about the commitment of Canada\u2019s amateurs, though, that the upset of the tournament was still a real possibility well into the final quarter. The margin was a slender 23-19 courtesy of a 68th-minute try by the replacement Tyson Beukeboom and it needed a 71st-minute penalty from Emily Scarratt to settle fluttering English nerves.\nIn the final analysis the Red Roses had particular reason to thank Dow for her match-turning intervention in the 50th minute of a compelling game which was delicately poised at 18-12 in their favour with Canada camped on their opponents\u2019 line. After a breakdown turnover in England\u2019s 22, a jinking Claudia MacDonald made good initial ground before inviting Dow to burn off the cover from 65 metres out.\n\nThe Wasps winger, who broke a leg in March and only just barely recovered in time for this tournament, needed no second invitation and England were suddenly 23-12 ahead and able to breath again. While the consistently influential Zoe Aldcroft was named player of the match, it was Dow\u2019s dash that proved to be the decisive moment on a bright, sunny afternoon.\nOne or two beaten captains might have been tempted to query the legality of England\u2019s all-important turnover but Sophie de Goede, the outstanding Canadian skipper, graciously declined to do so. It was another decent reason to admire her and her defiant team, many of whom have had to make extraordinary personal and financial sacrifices simply to be here.\nAt no stage, however, did Canada make life easy for the professionals opposite them. They were feisty and determined from the outset and, with a strong breeze behind them, England were grateful for the cushion of an early 12-0 lead. First a scrum penalty set up an opportunity for a signature driven lineout, expertly finished by Marlie Packer, before a teasing diagonal run by Helena Rowland helped to put the alert Dow over for her first score of the day in the right corner.\nCanada, though, responded almost immediately with a kick-and-chase try finished by their long-striding flanker Karen Paquin and they also displayed plenty of defensive enthusiasm. The England lock Abbie Ward was held up over the line when a try looked almost certain but it was the underdogs who, remarkably, enjoyed more territorial advantage in the opening 40 minutes.\nIt was no less than they deserved when a rumbling driven maul of their own put England under concerted pressure in their 22 to create space on the left for the centre Alysha Corrigan to score. The outstanding De Goede, who probably drove the team bus to the ground as well, converted to level the scores at 12-12 and leave England with some more problem-solving to do.\n\nA Scarratt penalty from in front of the posts just before the half-time siren did earn her side a slender lead at the interval but their usual control and physical dominance was only sporadically apparent. They have not spent much time on the back foot in recent years or at this tournament, and it was not proving a comfortable experience.\nThe unfortunate loss of Rowland with an ankle injury four minutes after the restart also robbed them of their most creative running back. With Hannah Botterman and Lucy Packer having also pulled out on the eve of the game and Vickii Cornborough sent to the sin-bin in the third quarter, England seldom looked completely comfortable and Beukeboom\u2019s try threatened to yield a major surprise.\nScarratt\u2019s third penalty, however, slowed Canada\u2019s momentum and the Red Roses coolly saw out the closing minutes. They will be aware, even so, that they have yet to find their best form out here and even some of their senior players seem to be feeling the weight of expectation that now follows them everywhere.\n\nThe final will be no pushover, either, with New Zealand having edged to a 25-24 victory in a thrilling second semi-final against France. The Black Ferns had trailed 17-10 at half-time only for tries by Ruby Tui and Theresa Fitzpatrick to give the defending champions fresh hope. A second try for the excellent Romane M\u00e9nager dragged France back into the contest, however, and the game hinged on a last-minute penalty miss from Caroline Drouin which let the Black Ferns off the hook. \nIt capped an excellent day\u2019s rugby watched, over the course of the two games, by about 23,000 spectators. \nMuch of New Zealand appeared to be waiting to see who made the final before fully committing to the tournament but the organisers now have their dream showdown. England have their long unbeaten record and winning mentality, while the Black Ferns will have an entire host nation roaring them on. In terms of box-office marketability it could be the game that elevates women\u2019s rugby to another level."

                    "body": "The Football Association has sought, and believes it has assurances, that LGBT+ couples who hold hands in Qatar during the World Cup will not face prosecution.\nThe FA has also been told that supporters with rainbow flags will not be arrested \u2013 as long as supporters do not \u201cdisrespect\u201d the local culture and norms by draping them over mosques.\n\nQatar\u2019s laws, which criminalise same-sex relationships, have raised considerable concern among LGBT+ fans who fear for their safety at the finals this winter.\nAlthough those laws will stay in place during the tournament, the FA chief executive, Mark Bullingham, said he had been encouraged by talks with the Qataris \u2013 as well as the introduction of an \u201cenabling law\u201d for the World Cup, under which minor offences will not prosecuted.\nOn a day when it was announced that the England captain, Harry Kane, will wear an anti-discrimination armband in Qatar as part of the FA\u2019s plans to highlight human rights, Bullingham was asked what would happen if any England LGBT+ fans were arrested for holding hands at the finals tournament.\n\u201cWe absolutely have been asking those questions of the Qatari authorities over the last six months,\u201d Bullingham replied. \u201cBut the laws you\u2019re referring to actually get suspended for a period of time before the World Cup, so the actions you are referring to aren\u2019t illegal.\u201d\nBullingham also appeared to broadly praise the Qatari authorities for listening to the FA\u2019s concerns over LGBT+ issues, saying: \u201cThey\u2019ve absolutely told us all the right answers for anything we\u2019ve talked about, even down to \u2018are our rainbow flags allowed\u2019?\n\u201cYes, absolutely, as long as someone doesn\u2019t go and drape them on the outside of a mosque \u2013 that was one example we were given \u2013 and were disrespectful in that way. They have absolutely been briefed to be very tolerant and act in the right way.\u201d\nDespite Bullingham\u2019s upbeat tone it remains highly unclear where the bar for a \u201cminor offence\u201d will be set \u2013 whether that is kissing in public or even holding hands. Sources close to the Qatar authorities continue to maintain that fans will still have to respect the local culture, where public displays of affection are frowned upon, and have been opaque in confirming where the line will be drawn.\nBullingham also conceded he had met the Three Lions Pride supporters group, which advocates for England\u2019s LGBT+ fans, and some were still worried about travelling to Qatar.\n\u201cWe understand their concerns,\u201d Bullingham said. \u201cWe met with them and I understand quite a few of them won\u2019t be going out.\n\u201cThe message we have had from Qatar overall is that everyone is welcome and those communities are absolutely welcome. Where they have been a bit frustrated is that they have asked several follow-up questions and not got the answers.\n\u201cI think a few of them feel they have timed out in terms of getting the information they need to know they are safe on the ground,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have asked the question in lots of meetings with the security teams on the ground and they all give the right answers, but there is certainly more information needed.\u201d\n\nThe FA is also calling for Fifa and the World Cup organisers to ensure families of migrant workers who have lost their lives or have been injured in construction projects receive compensation.\nLess than two months before the tournament starts, the issue of human rights in Qatar remains an ongoing concern. The Guardian has highlighted how workers employed on World Cup-related projects are earning a basic wage of 1,000 riyals (\u00a3225) a month, the equivalent of about \u00a31 an hour.\nAmnesty has also called on Fifa to set aside at least $440m for the hundreds of thousands of migrant workers in Qatar who have suffered human rights abuses during preparations for the World Cup \u2013 the same as the prize money due to be handed out at the competition."

                    "body": "Australia have put their Women\u2019s Rugby World Cup hopes back on track with an Ashley Marsters try in the 73rd minute, securing a thrilling comeback win in their second match of the campaign against Scotland in Whangarei, New Zealand. After their heartbreaking implosion against New Zealand\u2019s Black Ferns in the opening round, the Wallaroos trailed all game against Scotland only to cross twice in the final 20 minutes of game time to post a crucial first victory of the campaign. Australia\u2019s Eva Karpani, Grace Hamilton and Sharni Williams were standouts in the triumph. Wallaroos skipper Shannon Parry said it \u201cwasn\u2019t pretty\u201d but lauded her players for the way they stayed in the fight. \u201cIt was nerve-wracking. It was a real tough battle against Scotland, they really showed us how to play some footy there today,\u201d Parry told Stan Sport. \u201cI\u2019m immensely proud. We gutted it out all the way to the end \u2013 an 80-minute performance \u2013 and to come away with that victory, it\u2019s a really good reward.  \u201cWe didn\u2019t play as good, as clinical as we wanted to but we\u2019ll take the points. We\u2019re still alive in this tournament, and that\u2019s what matters.\u201d The Wallaroos\u2019 win consigned the Scots to consecutive last-gasp defeats. Taking part in their first Rugby World Cup in 12 years, Scotland last week lost a heartbreaker in the opening round against Wales, kicked from what might have been a famous comeback victory into a narrow 85th-minute 18-15 defeat by a Keira Bevan\u2019s post-siren penalty. Scotland showed they were chasing revenge when they started with gusto, rocking the Wallaroos by jumping to an early lead when veteran front-rower Lana Skeldon charged over in the ninth minute from the maul for the opening five-pointer, 11 years after making her Test debut for Scotland against the Netherlands. In the 18th minute, dominant Scottish flier Rhona Lloyd scooted away for what seemed a certain try. Somehow recovering from the bone-rattling tackle of Iliseva Batibasaga to retrieve the lost ball behind her, Lloyd then ducked under a pack of gold defenders into yawning space, then flew into a yawning gap with the line wide open. But, in desperate scenes, Wallaroos winger Maya Stewart then fullback Lori Cramer swooped from left and right to hit Lloyd from either side and spilled the ball free just before she crossed. It was a massive save and proved crucial to the final result. Especially when the Scots extended their lead in the 27th minute with a penalty try, after a forward drive to the line was collapsed by Adiana Talakai who compounded the seven-point gift by being sent to the bin with a yellow card. It took Scotland\u2019s lead to 12-0 at half time and left Australia\u2019s World Cup hanging by a thread. In their first pool match at Eden Park, the Wallaroos had defended stoutly and taken their chances in attack and counterattack, to seize on New Zealand mistakes and go 17-0 at half time. But before over 40,000 Kiwi fans, the Wallaroos had let that lead slip, conceding 41 unanswered points to the Black Ferns in the second stanza. Against Scotland at half time, they found themselves similarly flummoxed but for very different reasons. Australia had made 239-metres to Scotland\u2019s 142 with 110 passes to Scotland\u2019s 32, as 19-year-old Bienne Terita, in just her third Test, caused havoc and veteran Sharni Williams tore up the midfield in her fourth World Cup.  Despite 63% possession in the first half the Wallaroos had given up 65% of territory to the Scots in the opening 4o minutes. The other remarkable stat was the Australians had made just 22 of 28 tackles whereas their rivals had executed a massive 81 of 97 tackles. Despite making all the running, the Wallaroos were still trailing. Twenty minutes into the second stanza, Australia still hadn\u2019t bothered the scorers. But with the strong Whangarei wind at their back they were finishing fast. Arabella McKenzie was stopped just short of the stripe, then Eva Karpani was held up as Australia hammered beyond 10-phases under a penalty advantage. Finally, the blue wall cracked as Scotland ran out of numbers and a cutout ball from McKenzie found Terita for a simple finish to make it 12-7 with the conversion. In the 71st minute Australia knocked Scotland off the ball to win a new penalty and spurned three points for an attacking scrum 30-metres out. A fantastic carry off the scrum win from Terita took it the 22 before Scotland infringed in front of the posts. Australia opted for another scrum and went left, eventually finding Marsters charging in on an angled run at first receiver to split the line and crash over. Cramer added the extras to put Australia 14-12 in front with eight minutes to play. But when Marsters was red-carded for head-on-head contact with Sarah Law in the 76th minutes, the game took another twist as Australia were asked to hang on with 14 players. There was another red card in the closing stages as Talakai\u2019s tackle took her yellow into the red zone and saw Australia down to 13. Although the Scots launched fresh waves of attack, the gold line held firm to the end to secure a brave Wallaroos victory. Although those late red cards to both hookers leave Australia vulnerable going forward, they now prepare to face Wales at Northland Events Centre in Whangarei next Saturday knowing that a win should ensure progression to the quarter-finals. Scotland\u2019s task just gets harder, as they face New Zealand in their final pool game."

                    "body": "Injuries, recoveries, surprising selections, awe-inspiring feats with bat, ball and in the field, on-pitch controversy and off-field scandal: as the world\u2019s elite cricketers have gathered in Australia over the last couple of weeks all of these boxes have been ticked \u2013 and the T20 World Cup has not even started.\nThat changes on Sunday, when the action gets under way in somewhat understated style with a double-header in Geelong, where Namibia play Sri Lanka and then Netherlands face the UAE. Though Sri Lanka are a team on the rise, and recent winners of the Asia Cup, these are not exactly the kind of blockbuster fixtures that will grab the world\u2019s attention, nor are they being played on one of Australia\u2019s legendary grounds.\n\nOn Monday, while the second group of the opening phase \u2013 which includes West Indies, as well as Scotland, Ireland and Zimbabwe \u2013 begins in Tasmania, many cricket fans will be distracted by events in Brisbane, where the eight teams that have automatically qualified for the second round play each other in warm-up matches.\nThis, though, is the more intriguing group, particularly for British fans. Scotland start against West Indies, the overwhelming favourites, not that the prospect is likely to daunt them. They opened last year\u2019s World Cup by playing the side generally considered the outstanding team in that group, beat Bangladesh and surfed into the Super 12s with a 100% record.\n\nBut there is one statistic that puts into focus the nature of the challenge facing the Scots: since Australia lifted the trophy in Dubai last November West Indies have played 24 T20 internationals, Ireland and Zimbabwe have played 22 and 16 respectively, and Scotland have played two. That is half as many as Botswana, a third of Vanuatu\u2019s total and a fifth of Hong Kong\u2019s. There were two unofficial warm-up games scheduled in Australia over the last week and they beat the Netherlands impressively in the first; but the second was rained off without a ball bowled on Thursday. They head into the tournament not so much undercooked as still a collection of raw ingredients.\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t played a lot of T20 cricket as a group since last year\u2019s World Cup but we know what we can do in this format,\u201d their coach, Shane Burger, said as the rain fell in Melbourne. \u201cI have faith that the guys are going to step up to the mark again when the tournament gets under way.\u201d\n\nIreland\u2019s preparation has been strong \u2013 India, New Zealand, South Africa and Afghanistan all visited over the summer and, though the first three left with 100% records, the Afghans were beaten 3-2. Despite the absence of their key bowler Craig Young, ruled out last week by the recurrence of a hip injury, a place in the Super 12s looks within their grasp. Motivation will certainly not be an issue, with memories still fresh of their failure to beat Namibia in their final group match which led to elimination.\n\nDespite the curious absence of Shimron Hetmyer, cut from the squad after failing to turn up for his flight to Australia, West Indies surely have enough quality to progress \u2013 as do Sri Lanka, by a margin the outstanding side in Group A. The Netherlands will aim to join them in the Super 12s despite the retirements of Ryan ten Doeschate and Pieter Seelaar. In their absence the Dutch have found a potential new leader in Bas de Leede, the 22-year-old batter who scored half-centuries in both T20s against New Zealand in August and 89 against Pakistan in an ODI.\nIf the rankings are accurate, Sri Lanka will top that group and join England, Australia, New Zealand and Afghanistan in the Super 12s while West Indies should win the second to move into the other pool. But should either of those sides come second, the result would be to tick another significant box and provide that crucial ingredient for any classic tournament: a group of death."

                    "body": "As some of the biggest names in football gather in Doha for today\u2019s World Cup draw, commentators will no doubt point out how much money Qatar has lavished on its preparations for the sporting mega-event. They will talk of its vast, gas\u2011fuelled wealth and the $500m (\u00a3380m) a week it was at one stage spending on new stadiums, transport links and infrastructure. But despite the billions spent, Qatar\u2019s World Cup infrastructure has been built on the cheap. Hundreds of thousands of workers have been forced to pay for their own recruitment and labour for years earning poverty wages. In villages and towns across South Asia and parts of Africa, young men desperate for work sign up with recruitment agents who, often in collusion with companies or brokers in Qatar, illegally extract huge sums from them in return for a job.  It can take a low-wage worker from Bangladesh a year of hard labour just to recoup the fees.   For some the bargain eventually pays off; money is sent home, houses are rebuilt, children sent to better schools and marriage dowries paid. Many workers return to Qatar multiple times, a sign perhaps of a lack of opportunities at home, but also that migration can work. But for many others, it\u2019s a trap. They find themselves deep in debt, unable to change jobs and on very low wages. In 2014 I met a worker building the Al Janoub stadium who was earning overtime pay of 45p an hour. In 2016, Amnesty International found scores of workers maintaining the green spaces around the Khalifa stadium earning a basic salary of about 50p an hour. Two years later, the Guardian interviewed a worker at Al Rayyan stadium earning about 60p an hour. And last year I met dozens of workers employed at Fifa-endorsed hotels, earning a basic wage of \u00a31.25 an hour or less. When the case of low wages at Al Janoub stadium was reported, the local organising committee said it was \u201cworking with the contractor to rectify any non-compliance\u201d. At Al Rayyan, the committee said it had rectified the case. These are not just a handful of extreme examples. When Qatar introduced a basic minimum wage the equivalent of \u00a31 an hour last year, the UN\u2019s International Labour Organization said that more than 400,000 workers would benefit. In other words, close to half a million workers were earning less than that at the time. That is assuming they get paid at all. Wage theft appears rife in Qatar: we reported on accounts from some of the men who built the offices used by the World Cup organising committee, as well as some of those who have worked on World Cup stadiums. Last month Human Rights Watch highlighted another case involving workers who had not been paid for up to five months. The Qataris point to labour reforms, announced in 2020, as a sign that things are changing. They also cite the abolition of the much-criticised kafala system, which barred workers from changing jobs, and the introduction of a minimum wage. Narad Nath Bharadwaj, Nepal\u2019s former ambassador to Qatar, told me that conditions for workers in Qatar are better than in other Gulf states but described the reforms as \u201csymbolic\u201d. He particularly criticised workers\u2019 wages, saying they receive far less than in other countries with similar levels of affluence. \u201cIt\u2019s a dire situation when workers are exploited, paid paltry wages, made to work eight to 10 hours a day in the inclement climate,\u201d he said.  Symbolic or not, reforms are not enough. According to the UN\u2019s Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, when business-related human rights abuses occur, \u201cstates must take appropriate steps to ensure \u2026 those affected have access to effective remedy\u201d. The local World Cup organising committee has taken an important step in that direction by requiring companies with stadium contracts to partly repay the recruitment fees of workers. But these men only ever made up a small fraction of Qatar\u2019s migrant workforce. Hundreds of thousands more have no prospect of repayment. Even in death, migrant workers often pay their own way. Families of workers who died have told me that the only help they got from Qatar came from their loved ones\u2019 co-workers, who gave up their own money to send a donation, often to help with costly funeral rituals. The Qatari authorities and Fifa talk a lot about the positive legacy of the World Cup. The local organising committee said: \u201cThis tournament is a powerful catalyst for delivering a sustainable human and social legacy ahead of, during and beyond the 2022 Fifa World Cup.\u201d But a real legacy would be to help ensure compensation for those who have suffered: men like Tilak Bishwakarma. Nine years ago, I met Tilak as he cremated the body of his son, Ganesh, on the banks of a river near his home in western Nepal. Ganesh had died in Qatar just months after arriving. When I got in touch with him recently, Tilak said the family had received no compensation from his employer. In fact, his son\u2019s death meant they had no way to pay back the loan they took out to pay for his job. \u201cMy heart cries whenever I think about him,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was my fate to cremate my son, while it should have been the other way round. Nothing hurts a father more than cremating his son.\u201d A spokesperson for the Qatar government said: \u201cThere are complex challenges that need to be overcome to protect economic migrants globally, including in Europe. For its part, Qatar is committed to eradicating illegal recruitment practices in its labour market and supporting efforts to tackle abuse and exploitation throughout the global economy.\u201d The spokesperson highlighted a number of initiatives the government has taken to address the payment of recruitment fees, including setting up recruitment centres in major labour-sending countries. \u201cCompanies in Qatar are legally required to compensate the families of all workers who lose their lives in a work-related incident,\u201d the spokesperson added."

Fan by day, Stasi by night.\n\nThis tournament is football\u2019s equivalent of a dirty burger \u2013 you know it\u2019s come from the power-washed off cuts of a cow following a life on death row bunched up with thousands of others before being slaughtered. But you just have to eat it.\nIt\u2019s instinctive to get excited by the World Cup \u2013 smiling at that picture of James Maddison with England face paint as kid, losing yourself in Dafydd Iwan\u2019s Yma o Hyd, or watching the Uruguay squad announcement film and just thinking how much you love football. There\u2019s a beautiful moment where the Australia midfielder Cam Devlin chokes up when he gets the call from his manager, Graham Arnold.\nThe Guardian Football Weekly podcast has recorded a number of special programmes that we\u2019ll release alongside previews of the tournament this week, specifically on the lives of the LGBTQ+ community, the rights of women and the treatment of migrant workers. The reality for these people has been written about extensively: gay dating apps populated by people masquerading as love interests to arrest or beat up genuine users. Meanwhile women rely on a male guardian for virtually all of their rights. And some of the migrant workforce \u2013 female domestic workers can experience a hidden life of abuse and violence, while men live in terrible conditions in insufferable heat \u2013 have paid the ultimate price. What\u2019s most striking is how difficult it is to speak to anyone on the record, such is the fear of reprisals.\nUnicef ambassador and LGBTQ+ ally David Beckham is being paid a reported \u00a3150m over the next 10 years to be an ambassador for Qatar. He has such power and influence that criticism has been thin on the ground from the football world. His support for this tournament legitimises it in the eyes of so many. It\u2019s such a grave disappointment, such hypocrisy \u2013 a legacy completely tarnished. How much money does he actually need?\nTim Cahill, Cafu, Samuel Eto\u2019o, Ronald de Boer and Xavi are all ambassadors, too. All with their name alongside a quote on the website. \u201cIt\u2019s easy to believe in the legacy projects when you see for yourself all the good they\u2019re doing,\u201d notes the Barcelona manager. Who to listen to? Xavi or Human Rights Watch? It is almost impossible to find unambiguous support for the tournament from anyone who isn\u2019t in some way paid by Fifa or the Qatari state.\n\nJ\u00fcrgen Klopp was, in part, right that it isn\u2019t a footballer\u2019s responsibility to be a human rights activist, but footballers are humans too. They live in the world. They have the power to do more than just say: \u201cI\u2019m a football person, I can only talk about football.\u201d See the Socceroos\u2019 powerful video and Jackson Irvine\u2019s call for LGBTQ+ rights to see how it can be done.\nAnd we are all hypocrites \u2013 I don\u2019t know the working conditions of whoever made the hard disc on this laptop. I didn\u2019t check whether my coffee was fair trade this morning. We can all do better. And there are of course human rights abuses in all countries. But the logical extent argument is that you can\u2019t criticise anything without criticising everything.\nSo can we watch with a clear conscience? Can we feel the agony of England\u2019s defeat in pure footballing terms? Why did Gareth wait until the 115th minute to bring on James Maddison?\nAnd what can we realistically do? How much, if any, lasting change will this World Cup create in Qatar is impossible to know. And we will move on quickly. Oh look, it\u2019s the fourth round of the Carabao Cup.\nBut we can at least go into this competition with our eyes open. And focus on Fifa. The #PayUpFifa campaign is worth fighting for, despite Qatar\u2019s labour minister calling it a publicity stunt. The secretary general of Amnesty, Agn\u00e9s Callamard, has called on Gianni Infantino to break his silence on the creation of a workers\u2019 compensation fund of $440m (\u00a3370m) \u2013 equal to the player prize-money pool. Neither Qatar or Fifa wants to accept responsibility. You fear they wouldn\u2019t budge even under a huge wave of pressure. But why not at least try to force their hand?\n\nFifa has insisted it \u201cremains in positive continuing dialogue\u201d with labour organisations and the Qatari authorities over \u201cinitiatives that will benefit migrant workers in Qatar long after the final game of the World Cup\u201d. It has also said there had been a \u201cgreat response\u201d to Infantino\u2019s letter calling for teams to \u201cfocus on the football\u201d, with various teams backing it. But that does not answer the question that remains for the rest of us: What should we all do?\nI\u2019ve been a member of Juan Mata\u2019s Common Goal for a few years, committed to donating 1% of my annual earnings to charity. For this World Cup I\u2019ll give the same again to the families Fifa won\u2019t compensate. It\u2019s not a huge gesture \u2013 perhaps I\u2019m just trying to make myself feel better. Some will say that\u2019s not enough, that you can\u2019t just offset human rights, moreover people\u2019s lives, and they might be right. But it\u2019s something."

                    "body": "A second MEP has been arrested as part of a criminal investigation into alleged bribery, corruption and money laundering at the European parliament. Marc Tarabella of Belgium was taken in for questioning after police arrived at his home at about 6am on Friday, according to Belgian press reports. Tarabella has previously declared his innocence. A statement from Belgium\u2019s federal prosecutor said an MEP identified as \u201cMT\u201d had been arrested for questioning and may soon appear before an investigative judge. It said police had searched a safe deposit box belonging to him in the city of Li\u00e8ge, as well as several offices in the town hall of Anthisnes, a small district in east Belgium where Tarabella has been mayor for nearly 30 years. He is the second MEP to have been detained over the investigation into alleged cash for influence payments from the governments of Qatar and Morocco. In December, a former European parliament vice-president, Eva Kaili, was arrested during a series of raids where police seized bundles of cash totalling nearly \u20ac1.5m. Tarabella\u2019s Brussels home was searched last month, and last week he was stripped of his immunity by the European parliament at the request of the Belgian federal prosecutor. He is suspected by investigators of having taken cash payments of between \u20ac120,000 and \u20ac140,000 to take supportive positions \u201cin favour of a third country\u201d, according to a report drawn up by the European parliament\u2019s legal affairs committee. Investigators believe he is a close associate of Pier Antonio Panzeri, a former Italian MEP thought to be the ringleader of the corruption network. Panzeri recently struck a plea bargain with prosecutors in which he agreed to provide information in exchange for a reduced jail sentence. Panzeri and Kaili were arrested in December along with Panzeri\u2019s former assistant Francesco Giorgi and the head of a Brussels-based NGO, Niccol\u00f2 Fig\u00e0-Talamanca. All four have been held in pre-trial detention. Kaili and Fig\u00e0-Talamanca have denied wrongdoing, while a lawyer for Giorgi has declined to comment. Tarabella, 59, has been a member of the European parliament since 2004, with a two-year gap between 2007 and 2009 when he was a minister in the regional government of Wallonia, the eastern Francophone part of Belgium. He was a member of the European parliament\u2019s delegation for relations with the Arabian peninsula, which includes Qatar. After the scandal broke, he stood down from that position and gave up his membership of the Socialists and Democrats group in the parliament. A month before the scandal emerged, Tarabella participated in a debate in the parliament\u2019s subcommittee on human rights on Qatar and the World Cup. Tarabella, who was not a member of that committee, criticised fellow MEPs who had drawn attention to the deaths of migrant workers building World Cup infrastructure in Qatar. He accused them of basing their criticism on outdated information and claimed neither China nor Russia had faced such questions when they hosted international sports competitions.  \u201cWe didn\u2019t have all of this when we were talking about Sochi or Beijing,\u201d he said, urging MEPs \u201cto actually respect [Qatar\u2019s] journey\u201d."

                    "body": "The buildup, hype and buzz England\u2019s women have experienced as they prepare for their tilt at the Rugby League World Cup could not be in greater contrast to the experiences of Jackie Sheldon and her squad of trailblazers 22 years ago. It may be a little over two decades but the journey women\u2019s rugby league has been on during that time feels much longer, a point that will be emphasised when Emily Rudge and her teammates kick off against Brazil on Tuesday at Headingley in front of a northern hemisphere record crowd for a women\u2019s rugby league match. It will be markedly different to what the players experienced on a series of low-key, easily overlooked nights in November 2000.  Few will look on with as much pride as Sheldon, not least because without her endeavours to stage that inaugural women\u2019s World Cup we may not have even reached this moment. \u201cWomen\u2019s rugby league had never had an international competition of any note before 2000,\u201d says Sheldon, who coached Great Britain in the tournament. She had been part of the coaching staff when the Great Britain Lionesses toured Australia for the first time in 1996. She then led them on a tour to New Zealand two years later. \u201cThere was really only three nations playing at that time, so when I was asked to help set up a women\u2019s World Cup, it was only ever going to be three teams.\u201d Australia and New Zealand accepted the invitations from Sheldon but the hard work was only just beginning. Devoid of any significant funding, Sheldon \u2013 who also assumed the role of tournament organiser \u2013 began to beg, steal and borrow. \u201cIn the towns where we wanted to host games, I had to go to the local authorities and plead with them to sponsor the matches and in return, I\u2019d give the local girls in the town some coaching sessions,\u201d she says, before laughing. \u201cI suppose it was a bit like horse trading. That was just to get the money to put the tournament on.\u201d Contrast that with the millions of pounds of investment that has gone into this year\u2019s tournament and near-professional camps the eight teams will experience. In 2000, there were games scheduled in Castleford and Dewsbury, and expectations that crowds would not get beyond a few hundred, given the lack of any serious women\u2019s domestic league in England, came to fruition. For this sixth World Cup, games are being held at major rugby league grounds with the final at Old Trafford as part of a double-header with the men.  Sheldon had something else to juggle: getting her squad not only match-ready to face Australia and New Zealand, but available to play. \u201cWe ran a camp, but it cost money,\u201d she says. \u201cWe did everything \u2013 bucket collections, sponsorship for the kits, but we also asked any girl who was called up to bring \u00a31,000 to help pay for it all. They all took unpaid leave from their jobs, so the sacrifices were immense.\u201d Even with all that fundraising, Sheldon needed more money, so she hatched an incredible plan. \u201cI had a call from Cilla Black\u2019s people,\u201d she says, smiling. \u201cShe was hosting a gameshow around that time called The Moment of Truth and they asked if we\u2019d be interested in doing a team challenge to win \u00a35,000. \u201cThey wanted to know what we\u2019d use the money for and I thought that would be perfect for the team suits. So we set the girls to work: not training for the tournament, but training to be on Cilla Black\u2019s gameshow.  \u201cFive of them had to juggle a diabolo from one end of a stick to another, pass it on to the next one and reach the end of the line. They didn\u2019t manage to do it in rehearsals once. But before they went on stage, live in front of the nation, I told them to forget about the suits and just enjoy the experience. They went out and did it for the first and only time, winning the \u00a35,000. \u201cWithout that money, I don\u2019t know how we\u2019d have coped. It was aired on TV the night before our first game. We all watched it in camp and it brought us together.\u201d Sheldon gave a group of students at Dewsbury College the task to design the tournament\u2019s logo. The winner received \u00a3500. When the tournament kicked off, just 750 watched Great Britain run New Zealand close in Orrell, losing 22-12. \u201cOn the 1998 tour, the average points difference between us was 33 points but in that first game, we got within 10,\u201d Sheldon says. \u201cWe\u2019d really tried to make sure we improved in time for the World Cup and we couldn\u2019t have done it without a whole array of support staff. We drafted so many volunteers in. The coaching staff, the doctors, everyone did it for free. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have big crowds, but we had some great games and the people who did come would agree.\u201d Great Britain made the final at Warrington\u2019s Wilderspool, but they were beaten 26-4 by New Zealand \u2013 1,262 people were there. On Tuesday afternoon, more than 10 times that many will watch England begin their quest for World Cup glory against debutants Brazil. It is a long way from the empty stadiums and the under-the-radar nature of what happened in 2000. \u201cI\u2019m very proud I played my part in making that happen, and lay the platform for what we\u2019ll see this year,\u201d Sheldon says. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t have done it without so many people working for free. I\u2019m honoured. And I hope the girls this year can inspire a new nation of women to pick up a rugby league ball.\u201d"

Wales travel to Switzerland bidding to book their finals place in Australia and New Zealand next year having beaten Bosnia\u2011Herzegovina 1-0 in Cardiff last Thursday. Victory will not automatically secure a World Cup spot, however, with Scotland hosting the Republic of Ireland and Portugal meeting Iceland and only two of the winning teams qualifying directly on the basis of their qualification records. The country that misses out will go into an inter\u2011confederation playoff in February.  \u201cIt is complicated, but it\u2019s competitive,\u201d the Wales manager, Gemma Grainger, said. \u201cIt keeps you on your toes. These games are knockout games. The only other way you play knockout games is in tournaments. So what a great experience for us to have to think about the possibility of extra-time, to have to think about the possibility of penalties. Knowing that we go through that as a team is such a thing for us to do.\u201d The Chelsea midfielder Ingle said: \u201cIt\u2019s like another cup final. It\u2019s probably our 12th cup final of this campaign. We\u2019ve had a lot of games and at this level they\u2019re all as important as the next. We\u2019ve been on a journey, but we want to go one better and get the win.\u201d The Scotland manager, Pedro Mart\u00ednez Losa, admitted his side must \u201chave a belief in what we are doing\u201d before their game with the Republic of Ireland at Hampden Park, where it is expected the women\u2019s team will break its attendance record. \u201cWe are in the best place that we could be,\u201d Mart\u00ednez Losa said. \u201cIt\u2019s one opportunity potentially every four years. We just prepare for a final. We prepared for one final and now we are preparing for another.  It\u2019s an incredible opportunity to be involved and play in a World Cup and inspire a generation of players and make the game better.\u201d Scotland finished runners-up in Group B, behind Spain, and Wales finished runners-up in Group I, behind France, to earn their places in the playoffs. Mart\u00ednez Losa\u2019s side secured a 1-0 win in extra-time against the Euro 2022 quarter-finalists Austria to set up the second-round match with the Republic of Ireland, while Wales also needed extra-time to beat Bosnia and Herzegovina and secure the tie with Switzerland."

I\u2019m here for that. Don\u2019t criticise anyone. Don\u2019t criticise Qatar.\u201d And in that moment it became clear what we were watching. Here he is: Football Jesus.

At times the spectacle was so captivatingly grotesque you didn\u2019t want to breathe or cough for fear of breaking the magic.\nBecause this speech was also Infantino\u2019s moment. This was his Imagine, his I Have a Dream, his Earth Song, his Now We Move on to Liars. With this screed of whining imperial discontent, I declare this World Cup open.\nReally, though, in between the pull quotes and the killer lines, Infantino\u2019s performance was something far more disturbing. This was the sound of a man who seems not just tired and angry but oddly hollowed out, who has spent so long residing close to death and to corruption by others that it has begun to rot him from the inside like a dead fish.\n\nThe opening remarks will take the headlines. Striding to his podium with an air of grandiose faux humility, Infantino paused, let the silence gather, then shared his feelings. \u201cToday I feel Qatari. Today I feel Arab. Today I feel African. Today I feel gay. Today I feel disabled. Today I feel [like] a migrant worker.\u201d\nIt is tempting to marvel at the virtuosity here. Accused of betraying the rights of assorted minority groups, of promoting only the interests of the powerful, in the space of three short seconds Infantino wore gay face, he wore African face, he wore disabled face.\nMost cynically, Fifa\u2019s president dressed himself up in the clothes of a deceased migrant worker killed building that \u00a34bn cash machine. Later on, explaining his struggle against prejudice as a white man in Switzerland, he brandished his own red hair and freckles like a magician triumphantly producing a rabbit from a bowler hat.\n\nIt was, it goes without saying, a wretched spectacle \u2013 not to mention myopic, tin-eared and oddly lost. Either side of which Infantino basically talked a lot of horse shit. There will be wider fact checks available on the many half-truths and misleading angles spouted here. Some stood out.\nAt one point Infantino seemed to be saying that Qatar offers hope and succour to the poor and desperate people of the world, whereas Europe closes its borders and refuses to help. There are a great many things wrong with the UK. But it is also a longstanding complaint that Qatar is profoundly opposed to helping asylum seekers and refugees. Last year Qatar took just 197 refugees despite having a war on its doorstep and being one of the world\u2019s richest nations. Zambia took 75,000. The UK took 137,000. Infantino is not just dissembling here, he is simply wrong.\nThere was plenty more of this stuff. Infantino suggested his own trip to Iran had brought peace and tolerance to the nation. \u201cIf a few thousand women in Iran are happier because of me, then I will take every criticism,\u201d he schmoozed, which will certainly come as interesting information to the women of embattled, brutally patriarchal Iran.\n\nHe boasted about Fifa\u2019s new human rights strictures on World Cup bids. \u201cSo would Qatar be allowed to apply as a host now?\u201d he was asked. \u201cYes of course because the World Cup is open to all,\u201d Infantino bounced straight back.\nAt times like these you see his thin but dogged talent, the thing that has put him on that stage, the sense of a giant marzipan man oozing into whatever shape fits the moment, sliding under the door out of reach, altering the contours of his face \u2013 marzipan concern, marzipan defiance \u2013 as it turns from side to side.\nHe did make some legitimate points. Fifa\u2019s basic argument is that things in Qatar are not perfect, but they are better than they were. And that nobody but Fifa has addressed these issues, which is true if you ignore everyone else who has been addressing these issues for years. But the World Cup has undoubtedly made some things happen.\nHe is also right that the cancellation of beer sales within the stadium complex is not such a huge issue in itself. The fat end of the wedge is, frankly, already upon us. Drinking beer is not a human right, not least in an Islamic country. If the hosts are uncomfortable, whenever that emerges, frankly it is hard to argue back.\nAside from all that, beneath the faux concern and the cod-statesman stuff, the base note of this extraordinary show was rage. Infantino is clearly furious with his critics, furious that this thing cannot be bent to his will. And by the end it had become hugely engrossing just to see someone so blind to his own contortions, so shameless, and quite clearly losing his grip on his own spectacular.\nInfantino announced at one point that he feels \u201c200% in control\u201d of this World Cup, which sounds like the kind of thing someone might say just as their World Cup rears up and gallops off into a creak. Not least when that World Cup is already reeling from sponsor slap-down, shifting dates and constant noises off.\nThis is the most alarming part of Gianni\u2019s song, the Infantino Monologues. For all the inanity and toxic spin, one fact remains. That person up there, Corporate Spartacus, with his gay-migrant-African call to arms, is actually in charge of this show, caretaker of this shared sporting jewel. The global game, always such a faithful reflection of the global times, has rarely looked so busted, so loose on its hinges, so out of control."

Yet Silva denied Ronaldo\u2019s situation is a distraction and was asked if he and other squad members have offered support to the 37-year-old.\n\nSilva said: \u201cTop, top, top. The news that comes from England has nothing to do with the national team so I won\u2019t say anything. It doesn\u2019t concern me, it concerns Cristiano. I don\u2019t have to comment. It\u2019s a matter for Cristiano, I\u2019m not a Manchester United player and even if I was I would not answer that because we\u2019re in the national team so I\u2019m not going to talk about it.\u201d\nSilva was asked if there is any friction between Ronaldo and Bruno Fernandes\u2019s, who is also in the Portugal squad and a United teammate, given the divisive nature of the centre-forward\u2019s claims.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t see any strange atmosphere in our national team between Cristiano or Bruno,\u201d Silva added. \u201cOnce again I say that it\u2019s his issue, I don\u2019t even play for this club. An issue that has to be resolved with the right person. It\u2019s a situation with the club. I see him motivated and focused on the national team like all of us. It\u2019s one more thing to help our country, it\u2019s an individual matter. You only talk about it in press conferences when Portugal has a World Cup to play. I don\u2019t understand your persistence on this subject, because there is nothing.\u201d\nPortugal\u2019s opening match of Qatar 2022 is against Ghana on Thursday. Silva was asked if the team play any different when Ronaldo is not in the XI.\n\u201cIt has to do with the fact that it is a different generation, different players. In the last eight years, almost all the players have changed, apart from two or three. It is a very strong generation, almost all of them play in the best leagues, in the best clubs. When Cristiano is not there, the national team has known how to respond, we are 26 [players] \u2013 it doesn\u2019t matter if there\u2019s one or the other [in the team], we\u2019re going to do our best to represent our country,\u201d he said."

                    "body": "If only the World Cup could be about the football. Last week, Fifa sent a letter to the football authorities of the 32 competing nations to urge them to \u201cfocus on the football\u201d and to ensure it is not \u201cdragged into every ideological or political battle\u201d. Which is fine so long as you are not gay, a woman, a migrant labourer, a believer in democracy or a person with a conscience \u2013 or indeed any of the people Gianni Infantino claimed to be in his risibly hypocritical speech on Saturday.\nThis is, of course, the same Fifa president who was at Davos earlier in the year and who last Tuesday spoke at the G20 summit in Bali, calling for a ceasefire in Ukraine for the duration of the World Cup \u2013 a laudably neutral position, providing you are unaware Ukraine has just recaptured Kherson and has momentum such that any pause in the fighting is of clear advantage to Russia and Vladimir Putin. Infantino, coincidentally, was awarded the Order of Friendship by Putin in 2019 after Russia had hosted the World Cup. How complicated these things are! Thank goodness Infantino overcame the ginger jibes to do the politics for us.\n\nSo to take him at his word and focus on the football \u2013 which is, after all, the reason Fifa exists \u2013 the idea that football\u2019s authorities actually have the good of football at heart is laughably naive. Any governing body that cared more about the game would not deliver bloated tournaments such as the Euros that feature the mucky compromise of best third-place teams going through. That means a lot of games lack jeopardy, while teams who play later have the advantage of knowing exactly what they need to do to progress. It is not yet clear how the 48 teams will be arranged for the next World Cup but it is hard to see a good way, so we should probably enjoy the clean simplicity of eight groups of four while we still can.\nIn an ideal world teams would be turning up refreshed and prepared. There would have been a break after the domestic season ended so squads could have a couple of weeks together to fine-tune systems. Some sides have done that but any player based in England, Germany, Italy, France, Portugal or the Netherlands had a week. Clearly that is not enough. There have never been fewer than 16 days (and 20-24 is more usual) between the Champions League final and the start of a World Cup \u2013 which means most players have had around four weeks to prepare.\nIt is true that a lot of teams played in either the Euros or the Copa Am\u00e9rica last summer or in the Africa Cup of Nations earlier this year and so, for some, the preparation is already largely done. But there has been little chance for teams to experiment or make changes since: in common with most of Europe, England\u2019s past six games were all in the Nations League, and four of those came in June when the players were exhausted.\n\nCome September for the final two Nations League games that also doubled as World Cup preparation, Gareth Southgate, to take one example, was left in effect with a choice of either picking Harry Maguire to see if he could still prosper with the national team despite struggling at Manchester United or trialling possible replacements on the left side of central defence. He opted to stick with what he knew so neither Fikayo Tomori nor Marc Gu\u00e9hi is in England\u2019s 26 while Maguire is almost certain to start, despite his indifferent form.\nSouthgate, presumably, would also have liked a friendly or two to see how Ivan Toney, or indeed James Maddison, fared in an England system before making the decision to select the latter and discard the former. But there has been no opportunity.\n\nWill that matter? For teams that were fairly settled, perhaps not too much. Argentina won the Copa Am\u00e9rica and can rumble on. Senegal won the Cup of Nations and have essentially been building for four years. Injuries to Giovanni Lo Celso and Sadio Man\u00e9 complicate matters but essentially they know what they are doing. But Ghana, for instance, have installed an entirely new coaching structure since the Cup of Nations and would probably have benefited from more than two friendlies between the summer and naming their squad.\nThe Cup of Nations offers clear evidence of the lack of preparation time. Because of the compressed calendar and Covid protocols, no side had more than a week of buildup and many found themselves training with reduced squads. So the first round of games was extremely risk-averse, with most teams preferring to sit deep and few having had time to develop the fluency to overcome such tactics. Those fixtures yielded only 1.12 goals per game, as against 2.06 for the rest of the tournament.\n\nIt may be that that checks the direction in which international football has seemed to be going. Portugal won Euro 2016 and France reached the final of that tournament and won the 2018 World Cup with grim cussedness, keeping things tight and looking to nick a goal from a set piece or via a moment of brilliance from a forward. It is that model, with limited pressing, that Southgate\u2019s England largely follow.\nOther contenders, though, seem to have moved on: it may not be as sophisticated as the top club sides but Spain and Germany, even Brazil and Argentina, play a form of pressing game. Perhaps the muscle memory is strong enough for them to be able to pick up their style straight away but, if not, there could be an advantage for the more rigid, lower-block sides such as England, France and Portugal.\nBut the point is less what a successful style is likely to be than that the schedule of the competition is having an impact upon, and perhaps even slowing, the evolution of the game. Judge Fifa on the football? Happily: apart from all the more serious issues, Fifa has failed the sport it is supposed to govern and protect."

Walker\u2019s groin injury leaves him with an uphill battle to be fit for Qatar 2022, where England begin against Iran on 21 November, and White would hold genuine hope of a recall if the Manchester City player does not make it.  White shone in the middle for Arsenal last season but has been a revelation at right-back in their strong start this time around. He has proved highly adaptable and Arteta believes he can excel in the right-sided centre-back role Walker has occupied. Asked whether White could push for inclusion and if that position would suit him, he said: \u201cBoth. Ben would be very comfortable playing on the right side of a back three as well as in the middle, or as a full-back. If you ask me if he is ready to make that step then the answer is yes, because he is a very confident boy. He gives you absolutely everything, he is always available and he has the courage to play under real pressure.\u201d White won the most recent of his four caps in March, starting at right-back when England beat Ivory Coast 3-0 with a largely experimental side. He has fallen behind Fikayo Tomori and Marc Gu\u00e9hi in the pecking order at centre-back since then and, where Walker\u2019s spot in particular is concerned, would be deemed unlikely to start ahead of John Stones this winter even if called up. But Arteta believes his form as an attacking full-back speaks of an invaluable versatility. \u201cWe all believed he had the qualities to do that and the most important step, probably, was for him to believe he could do it and to feel comfortable in that position \u2013 and that the position could maximise his potential and give him another dimension as a player,\u201d he said. \u201cThe fact that now he can play in various positions will make him a more complete player and I think he\u2019s very happy with that.\u201d White is expected to start for Arsenal against Liverpool. His repurposing to the flank has partly been brought about by the exceptional form in central defence of Gabriel Magalh\u00e3es and William Saliba. The latter, in particular, has been compared in favourable terms to the visitors\u2019 Virgil van Dijk but Arteta rejected any resemblances to the Dutchman or his potential partner Jo\u00ebl Matip. \u201cThe moment they win everything the other two have is the right moment [to compare],\u201d he said."

                    "body": "England are close to being eliminated from the T20 World Cup after losing to Ireland and having their game against Australia rained off, but rather than being one defeat from departure Moeen Ali says the team are looking at things a little differently. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to tell ourselves, four wins and we have got the World Cup,\u201d he said. With two more games in their Super 12 group against New Zealand in Brisbane on Tuesday and against Sri Lanka in Sydney on Saturday, England must win both if they are to reach the semi-finals. Even then, given the nature of the group, they may finish level with one or more other sides and need to better them on net run rate.  \u201cWe\u2019ve got to win those games but could still potentially miss out,\u201d Moeen said. \u201cOur job is to win those two games and, if we can, win them comfortably and play our best cricket from now until the end of the tournament.\u201d New Zealand took control of the group on Saturday with a 65-run defeat of Sri Lanka, achieved with the help of a Glenn Phillips century and four Trent Boult wickets, despite being 15 for three after four overs of their innings. The nature of that victory, coupled with the similarly emphatic win over Australia in their opening game, gives them a massive net run rate and illustrates the task England face in their next game, albeit one they are fully aware of, having been knocked out of last year\u2019s tournament by the Black Caps in the semi-finals. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s unfinished business, but last year hurt quite a bit,\u201d Moeen said. \u201cThey\u2019re one of those sides that when it comes to tournaments they just know what they\u2019re doing. It will take everything to beat them. I can\u2019t remember playing New Zealand where we\u2019ve played average and won.\u201d Moeen hit 12 runs from the last three balls before the rain came down against Ireland, hauling his side to a possible victory after a previously tentative batting display. If England are to stay in the tournament they will need to play consistently with that kind of aggression. \u201cWe bat all the way down so we might as well entertain everybody, entertain ourselves and enjoy getting those 70s or 80s off 30 balls, because that\u2019s what really takes the game away,\u201d he said.  \u201cGetting totals of 160 or 170 on good wickets against good sides makes it too easy for them. We\u2019ve just got to be brave and go out and play the way we want to play. It doesn\u2019t mean going out and slogging but playing the way we can do. That was the reason why we were picked.\u201d Moeen has established himself as a particularly destructive player of spin, which could come in particularly handy against a New Zealand side that normally contains two spinners in Mitchell Santner and Ish Sodhi. \u201cTowards the end of Eoin Morgan\u2019s reign I almost was a bit of a floater at times, where as soon as the spinners came on he would get me padded up and say: \u2018Get ready to go in,\u2019\u201d Moeen said. \u201cI do enjoy that, not just because it\u2019s spin but because I like that feeling of rushing and just getting out there. There\u2019s no real position that I say that\u2019s my favourite spot. It is the situation more than anything where somebody has to get going. I enjoy that.\u201d Friday\u2019s abandoned game against Australia denied England what would have been one of the great occasions of the tour, in a near-full MCG against the host nation. Instead, they spent hours in their dressing room \u2013 \u201cWe played a few silly games with each other to try and keep ourselves entertained,\u201d Moeen said \u2013 before being told to return to their hotel. \u201cBefore I came out to Australia I did imagine it being a sunny day in Melbourne with a packed house, and you almost visualise guys coming in and bowling at you and you playing your best shots,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd then to go to a ground and not even step out is terrible. But you can\u2019t control the weather. On Friday, if we\u2019d played we could have been knocked out. Sometimes the weather\u2019s on your side.\u201d"

I was bullied, plus I was Italian, so imagine. I didn\u2019t speak good German. What do you do then? You lock yourself down in your room, you cry and then you try to make some friends. You try to engage \u2026 You don\u2019t start accusing or fighting, you start engaging. This is what we should be doing.\u201d\n\nInfantino\u2019s opening remarks set the tone for his unexpectedly lengthy address. They are personalised and speak to his key theme, that of hypocrisy and that the way to effect change is not through confrontation but \u201cengagement\u201d. The metaphor, comparing being bullied for having red hair to the experience of migrant workers who remain exploited in Qatar to this day, appears flippant, but is likely sincere. Infantino has also lumped together the experience of exploited workers and those of LGBTQ+ people whose sexuality is illegal in Qatar, with those of some Qataris themselves \u2013 especially those at the top of society \u2013 who feel they have been the subject of unfair criticism. This gives the impression of a relativist approach to a highly sensitive debate.\n\nIt\u2019s not easy every day to read all these critics of decisions that were taken 10 years ago when none of us was there. Now everyone knows we have to make the best out of it and make the best World Cup ever. Doha is ready, Qatar is ready, it will be the best World Cup ever, of course.\u201d\n\nInfantino is correct to observe that there has been widespread personnel change at Fifa since the decision was taken to award Qatar the World Cup in 2010. According to research by Nick Harris of the Mail on Sunday, 10 of the 22-member Fifa executive committee which voted on the deal have since been banned for ethics violations while another four have either been indicted or convicted of criminal corruption. At the time of the vote, Infantino himself was not a Fifa employee, but secretary general of the European governing body, Uefa.\n\n\nLet\u2019s start with the migrant workers. We are told many many lessons from some Europeans, the western world. I am European. I actually am. I think for what we Europeans have been doing in the last 3,000 years, around the world, we should be apologising for the next 3,000 years before starting to give moral lessons to people.\u201d\n\nIn the year 1,000 BC, the concept of Europe did not exist and those living within the geographical boundaries were emerging from the Bronze Age. But if you substitute 300 for 3,000 then many European countries were colonial powers, putting human beings into slavery and exploiting natural resources. An anti-slavery movement did not appear in the UK until the late 18th century. The question of whether, and to what extent, contemporary European societies are responsible for the past, and should perhaps also undertake restitution, remains an active debate. Again Infantino\u2019s criticism speaks to a perceived hypocrisy.\n\n\nI don\u2019t have to defend Qatar, I\u2019m defending football and injustice. We see here many government representatives coming to Qatar. They all come because a country which has just sand and pearls turns out to have something much more, it\u2019s gas. If there was no gas nobody would care. Now they all come and they all want something and who is actually caring about the workers. Who? Fifa does, the World Cup does and to be fair to them Qatar does as well.\u201d\n\nInfantino is right to observe that western governments, including those of the UK and USA, have a dependency on Qatari natural gas and oil, especially during the current Ukraine war. These governments, however, have not spoken out to criticise the World Cup, instead it has been a coalition of unions and NGOs as well as journalists and, in some cases, football authorities and players. These groups have been critical of Fifa and Qatar\u2019s \u201ccaring\u201d for workers.\n\nHundreds of thousands of workers from developing countries come to Qatar and earn many times more [than at home] and help families to survive. They do it in a legal way. We in Europe close our borders. Those who reach Europe or who want to go to Europe have to go through a very difficult journey and survive. If the EU really cared about the destiny of these people, then EU could also do as Qatar did to create some legal channels where at least a percentage of these workers could come to EU \u2026 give them some work, give them some future.\u201d\n\nCriticism of European treatment of migrants from outside the bloc is widespread and often comes from the same people who criticise the Qatar World Cup. However the European Commission claims that 21.6m people, or 4.2% of the total population, are third party nationals. In the UK, the 2021 census showed that 10m people living in England and Wales had been born outside the country \u2013 16.8% of the total population.\n\n\nI wonder why nobody recognises the progress that has been made since 2016 [when Infantino became Fifa president]? The kafala system was abolished, minimum wages were introduced, heat protections were put in place. ILO, unions acknowledged this, but media don\u2019t, or some don\u2019t.\u201d\n\nMoving from \u201cnobody\u201d to \u201csome\u201d suggests Infantino is aware his claim won\u2019t stick. Media have generally reported on the progress or otherwise of reforms in Qatar, especially through the research of those on the ground, including the International Labour Organization and Amnesty International as well as individual journalists.\n\nThe only way of obtaining results is by engaging, seeking dialogue, not by hammering, insulting. When your child does something bad at school and you tell him he\u2019s an idiot he\u2019s useless and you put him in his room what do you think his response is? If you talk to him say let\u2019s work together you will have better grades, he will recognise that and he will be better. I don\u2019t want to give you any lessons of life I just want you to realise that what is going on here is profoundly unjust.\u201d\n\nDifferent styles of parenting remain in practice. Again, the segue from his first point to his claim of profound injustice seems ambitious.\n\nMany organisations have recognised that workers\u2019 rights standards are similar here to those in western Europe, the standards are similar on safety. Let\u2019s see what happens in the next 10 years.\u201d\n\n\nThis seems a grand claim. Amnesty, in their last update before the World Cup, says forced labour continues \u201cunabated\u201d in Qatar, particularly among security and domestic workers. Pay is regularly withheld from workers, while thousands are still working unsafely, Amnesty say. Building and Woodworkers International, who have been on the ground in Qatar since 2016, say safety standards on World Cup sites have been found to be broadly comparable with western Europe, but they were not replicated in the industry more widely.\n\nPeople [in Qatar] are happy and want to cheer for the teams arriving, and what do I read: \u2018These people don\u2019t look English so they should not cheer for English because they look like Indians\u2019. I mean what is that? Can someone who looks Indian not cheer for England or for Spain or for Germany? You know what this is: this is racism. This is pure racism. They have difficult lives, everyone has difficult lives, we want to have a moment where we don\u2019t have to think about this.\u201d\n\nClaims that south Asians cheering the arrival of England in Qatar were \u201cfake fans\u201d were inaccurate. The accusations did, however, follow the revelation that Qatar had been paying people to be enthusiastic supporters during the tournament. Furthermore, the claim that someone \u201cwho looks Indian\u201d could not support England is different altogether. Infantino may also have been more revealing than intended when imagining an escape from this.\n\n\n[On the banning of beer at stadiums] Every decision taken in this World Cup is joint decision between Qatar and Fifa. There will be eight to 10 fan zones, over 200 places where you can buy alcohol anyway, I think personally if for three hours a day you cannot drink a beer you will survive. Maybe it\u2019s a big thing because it\u2019s a Muslim country, I don\u2019t know. We tried until the end to see if it was still possible. It\u2019s one thing having the plans and designs in place, then you look to see the flows of people, going to different matches, we have four matches on the same day so have to make sure people can go in and go out. That is why we had to take the decision about the beer.\u201d\n\n\nInfantino contradicts widely held views that Budweiser\u2019s beer stands were withdrawn at the request of Qatari authorities. He may be correct, but it was certainly the case that the sale of beer at the stadiums was not only considered possible but actually guaranteed by Fifa as little as two months ago. A spokesperson told the AFP in September that alcoholic beer would be sold \u201cwithin the stadium perimeter prior to kick-off and after the final whistle.\u201d This is no longer the case. However some people will not have to wait three hours for a drink, with VIP boxes still serving alcohol. The World Cup\u2019s \u201cmost luxurious\u201d hospitality offer, the Pearl Lounge, will offer a six-course meal, welcome drinks, champagne, cocktails a dedicated sommelier and \u201cguest appearances\u201d for $34,300.\n\nIf you want to criticise, come to me. Here I am, you can crucify me, I am here for that. Don\u2019t criticise Qatar, don\u2019t criticise the players, don\u2019t criticise anyone, criticise Fifa, criticise me because I am responsible for everything. How many occasions do we have to unite the world? Do we want to continue to spit on others because they look different or they feel different? We defend human rights. We do it our way. We obtain results. It\u2019s a step-by-step process, help us in doing more. Don\u2019t divide, don\u2019t split.\u201d\n\nInfantino\u2019s final remarks neatly encapsulate the whole speech: personally felt, lyrical and combining very different messages in one apparent argument. How many critics of the Qatar World Cup are \u201cspitting\u201d on others because \u201cthey look different\u201d? How many \u201cresults\u201d have actually been achieved? And is \u201cdon\u2019t criticise Qatar\u201d a plea or a demand?"

                    "body": "Eddie Howe believes there is still time for Callum Wilson to earn a place in England\u2019s squad for the World Cup in November. A thigh injury has dictated that the Newcastle centre-forward has not been named in Gareth Southgate\u2019s squad for the Nations League games against Italy and Germany, when he was widely expected to receive a recall. Instead England\u2019s manager has called up Brentford\u2019s former Newcastle striker Ivan Toney in what appears a key audition for the role of Harry Kane\u2019s principal understudy.  Howe, though, believes Wilson could yet add to his four senior caps in Qatar. \u201cI feel for Callum because he\u2019s not in the England squad,\u201d said Newcastle\u2019s manager, who, conscious of the 30-year-old\u2019s tendency to pick up injuries, signed Alexander Isak for \u00a359m from Real Sociedad last month. \u201cBut it will just fuel his motivation, it will fire him even more, so when Callum returns to our team he will show how good he is.\u201d  Although close to full fitness, Wilson is expected to miss out on Saturday\u2019s match with Howe\u2019s former club Bournemouth at St James\u2019 Park but should return after the international break. \u201cI think there\u2019s time for Callum to make the World Cup squad,\u201d said Howe. \u201cAnd I know Gareth feels the same. What does he have to do? He has to return and score and be consistent in his availability. Maybe he has to have a bit of luck somewhere else to make that plane.\u201d Before signing Isak Howe \u2013 who believes the Sweden striker could play alongside Wilson \u2013 explored the possibility of recruiting Toney. After making only two senior appearances for Newcastle, Toney was allowed to leave in 2018 during Rafael Ben\u00edtez\u2019s managerial tenure but has rebuilt his career at first Peterborough and now Brentford. Part of Howe\u2019s brief is to try to help prevent any future Toneys slipping through the Tyneside net. \u201cI\u2019d love to think that wouldn\u2019t happen now,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s not a criticism of anyone here at that time; why Ivan left, I don\u2019t know. But when you watch him play now and see his attributes and what he can bring to his team, he\u2019s an outstanding player. \u201cHis England call-up is a great thing for people that drop into the lower leagues. It gives them hope that it\u2019s not the end of their dreams. Ivan\u2019s had to work his way back up and he\u2019s done incredibly well.\u201d"

                    "body": "Football Ramble: Inside the Qatar World Cup  UnboxedThe Diary of a CEO With Steven BartlettGeneration Gap (BBC Radio 4) | BBC Sounds I\u2019m aware that the current football, erm, situation is not to everyone\u2019s taste. But for those of us who enjoy the game and don\u2019t hate women, LGBTQ+ people or migrant workers, it\u2019s been a bit of an odd week. I\u2019ve limited my participation to listening to the matches. This isn\u2019t a protest, I just don\u2019t really like the analysis/bantz football shows. They sometimes just feel like being talked at by pub bores. Still, if you\u2019re what is usually called a \u201cproper\u201d fan, there are umpteen World Cup audio shows: radio programmes and podcasts are popping out daily from the BBC, indie producers and commercial stations, packed with pundits a-punditing from stadium or sofa. Or you might try Inside the Qatar World Cup, an excellent three-part strand from Football Ramble. Host Kate Mason is that unusual thing: a female football journalist who worked in Qatar for a couple of years (for the beIN Qatar sports channel). Beginning at a seven-a-side women\u2019s game in Doha, the pitch completely hidden so no men can see, she talks to players, fans and coaches, most of whom withhold their names. Mason covers how women are treated in Qatar, the state of the country\u2019s men\u2019s national football league, visits the segregated workers and fan areas and speaks to migrant workers who actually worked on the stadiums. She also talks to Dr Nassar Mohamed, the only Qatari thought to have ever come out as gay (he had to claim asylum in the US), who explains in clear, measured terms just what gay people go through in his home country, including conversion practices and being \u201cdisappeared\u201d by the authorities. Mason is level-headed and sensitive throughout. An excellent series from an independent podcaster. Football, for the Qatari rulers, means business, as it does for many others. The Sidemen, a collective of some of Europe\u2019s most successful YouTubers (KSI, Miniminter \u2026 ask your kids), started their careers by putting up videos of themselves playing Fifa, or mucking about trying to score goals against each other, eventually staging celebrity charity matches watched by millions. Now their manager, 25-year-old Jordan Schwarzenberger, has a podcast, Unboxed, in which he talks to high-profile \u201ccreators\u201d (YouTubers, TikTokers, Instagrammers) and gets them to explain how they became successful.  At first, as a generation above the target audience, I was a bit lost. Who is Zac Alsop and why is Schwarzenberger interviewing him? (Answer: he\u2019s a YouTuber.) But I was won over by both men\u2019s straightforwardness and honesty. And actually, Alsop\u2019s description of what he does struck me as very much like editing a magazine: thinking about how to grab attention, what to offer the reader/watcher, which photo works, which cover line\u2026 Unboxed has lovely sound and crisp editing, plus, if you like your podcasts visual, you can watch the show as well as listen, which helps when discussion turns to specific \u201cthumbnails\u201d, the small still pictures used to promote YouTube videos.  Actually, I enjoyed Unboxed so much I tried out The Diary of a CEO, which I\u2019ve been avoiding because a) it\u2019s so successful it doesn\u2019t need my endorsement and b) I hate business talk. Also c) each episode is an hour and a half long, which is far too lengthy to iron to, even if you tackle the sheets. There are downsides to the show: entrepreneur and host Steven Bartlett\u2019s manner is superior, as though he, and only he, understands the real truth. And the highlights reel at the beginning is OTT. But Bartlett is very thorough, and I loved singer/producer Labrinth\u2019s account of growing up in a religious musical household. Being a guest on The Diary of a CEO is like being invited on to Desert Island Discs, a form of endorsement, so each interviewee is immensely happy to be there and willing to spill whatever beans are needed. Radio 4 is providing a lower-key, old-school business approach in the Generation Gap, where two differently aged practitioners of the same job talk about how they go about things. Last week we met GPs, cab drivers, builders, turkey farmers and, on Tuesday, Jan and Sonya, both hairdressers. Jan, 66, still does perms for her care-home clients, but, explains Sonya, 35, perming has fallen off hairdressers\u2019 training, replaced by how to put in extensions. Times and attitudes change, and such small cultural exchanges can reveal as much as any world-beating tournament."

                    "body": "\nThe main event\nIt is quite easy to forget about the third-place playoff at a World Cup with everyone focusing on the final. But who could forget Poland 3-2 France in 1982? Or Turkey 3-2 South Korea in 2002? Or even whatever happened when England played Belgium four years ago?\nToday, there is a chance for two more countries to make history in the bronze-medal match. Croatia face Morocco for the chance to call themselves the third-best team on the planet, which is not a bad claim to have in your back pocket. Here is an attempt to give you six reasons to be joyful about the match.\n1) Bidding an international farewell to Luka Modric After 162 caps (assuming he plays) the Real Madrid midfielder is set to bow out for Croatia. Modric is yet to confirm his international retirement but it looks likely. Either way, at 37, he will not be back for another World Cup. He made his international debut in 2006 and has aged like a fine armagnac. There is no doubt Modric is a key reason his country reached the final four years ago and came so close to repeating the feat in Qatar. Rightly adored in his homeland as one of the most elegant passers of the ball in the world game, Modric will leave a strong legacy behind him and another World Cup medal would be a lovely way to depart.\n2) Morocco could make more historyAlready the first African nation to reach a semi-final, Morocco could become the first to get a podium finish at a World Cup. It would be a positive ending to the tournament for the side that have given it so much. They have achieved greatness, outlasting almost everyone\u2019s predictions. To lose their final two matches would be a sad way to leave Qatar for a side that have shone brighter than most.\n3) Last chance to earn a move There are players in each squad that have shown themselves capable on the world\u2019s biggest stage, creating interest from potentially bigger and better-paying club employers. These players will be eager to prove themselves one final time to ensure they stand out for the scouts. Consistency is important for players, so a lowering of standards should not be accepted by them or their coach, especially when they are looking to better themselves.\n4) The \u2018booby prize\u2019Morocco\u2019s head coach Walid Regragui has described this match as a \u201cbooby prize\u201d but, importantly, it is still a prize. In the TV quiz show 3-2-1, presented by Ted Rogers, losing contestants would get a model of the show\u2019s mascot Dusty Bin as a small token of their failure. They were utterly worthless at the time, but now would surely sell for hundreds of pounds. So, even if the players are not too keen on the match, that bronze medal might come in handy one day.\n5) History for Croatia, tooSince joining Fifa in 1992 after becoming independent from Yugoslavia, Croatia have created a remarkable competitive record. In their first World Cup in 1998 they finished third after losing to France in the semi-final, beating the Netherlands 2-1 in the playoff thanks to goals from Davor Suker and Robert Prosnecki. Croatia failed to make it out of their group in 2002, 2006 and 2014 and failed to qualify in 2010 but went all the way to the final in 2018. Now they are 90 minutes away from another top-three placing. Since 1998 only France and Germany have made it to the final four more often than Croatia, not a bad record for a team that are barely 30 years old.\n\n6) Another chance to see Infantino It seems within seconds of any World Cup match starting, the camera pans to Gianni Infantino looking glum in the stands. The host broadcast camera operator always knows where to find the Fifa president, allowing the world to celebrate his greatness. Rarely has he looked happy when watching a match but he is always there, committed to the cause like a parent on muddy sidelines every weekend. He will make the best of the occasion to celebrate football as a cohesive power for good or some such, while ignoring the empty seats. And if that does not entice you, then nothing will.\nPS: it turns out Belgium beat England 2-0 to clinch third place in Russia. Who knew?\n\nTalking points\nWill illness derail France\u2019s push for back-to-back titles?France preparations for the final have been hit by a virus that has spread through the camp since the semi-final win over Morocco. The same illness that struck down Adrien Rabiot and Dayot Upamecano before the semi-final has reportedly been picked up by Ibrahima Konat\u00e9 and Rapha\u00ebl Varane. Both defenders impressed as they stood firm under intense pressure from Morocco and it would be a huge blow if one or both missed out. The French forward Randal Kolo Muani said: \u201cI think everyone has been careful. The doctors have put in place a hygiene system to avoid the virus spreading.\u201d Has that hygiene system worked well enough, though? GB\nWhere have all the red cards gone?Let\u2019s be honest, some of the most vivid World Cup memories centre around red cards and on-field pandemonium \u2013 think Zinedine Zidane\u2019s 2006 butt, the sound and fury of England v Argentina 1966, or Argentina being reduced to nine men in the rancorous closing stages of the 1990 final. With the exception of the Netherlands v Argentina in the quarter-finals, Qatar 2022 has been curiously bereft of all this. There have been only four sendings-off in this tournament, three of which took place in the closing stages of matches and only one being a straight red. That went to Wales\u2019s Wayne Hennessey for his full-frontal felling of Iran\u2019s Mehdi Taremi \u2013 and only after the VAR intervened. This continues a trend set at Russia 2018, when the number of dismissals tumbled from 10 in 2014 to four. There were a whopping 17 in South Africa 12 years ago. Whether this is a consequence of VAR, improvements in defensive discipline or less officious refereeing is hard to tell. But it\u2019s been striking nonetheless. TD\n\nBeyond the football\nAn app providing migrant workers in Qatar with information on their rights and the possibility of legal assistance has been launched by three trade unions, the first definitive legacy for workers exploited in the process of delivering the World Cup. The failure of Fifa and football associations to deliver positive change for workers has led the the international players\u2019 union Fifpro, the Building and Wood Workers\u2019 International (BWI) and the International Domestic Workers Federation (IDWF) to take action into their own hands by developing a digital platform to provide employment support. A joint statement read: \u201cWith the Fifa World Cup coming to a close on 18 December, International Migrants Day, Fifpro, BWI and IDWF remain committed to supporting the advancement of migrant workers\u2019 rights and conditions. The global unions encourage collaborations from all stakeholders to ensure that the working conditions and fundamental human rights of all workers involved in and around football tournaments are respected and protected.\u201d\nGlobal media-watch\nWith the semi-finals in the rearview mirror, the press in Qatar are predictably extolling the success of hosting the tournament. According to Jinan Al-Sabbagh in Al-Raya, \u201cQatar won great acclaim \u2026 for the impressive success of organising the world\u2019s largest tournament. Qatar amazed the world and made it the pride of the Arabs\u201d. Al-Raya is seen as the semi-official paper of the Qatari state, and said the country \u201cacted as a link that embraced the cultures of the world thanks to its hospitality and the morals of the generous Qatari people.\u201d\nMuhammad Qasabi reported for Al Sharq on a press conference held by the Qatari Sports Media Committee which declared that \u201call the visitors to the World Cup, including athletes, media professionals and fans, have discovered a truth other than that which some western media outlets reported to them, and this is the first gain from Qatar hosting the World Cup\u201d.\n\nFor Al-Watan, the lead story on Friday was of childhood dreams fulfilled, writing: \u201cA decade ago, attending World Cup matches from the stands was a childhood dream for soccer fans in the Arab world. The exorbitant costs of travel and hotel reservations, as well as the remoteness of the countries that usually win the organisation of the championship, were reflected in the reluctance to engage in this experience.\u201d All that, the paper says, has changed.\nThe Peninsula was thrilled that there would be some Qatari representation right at the end of the tournament, with Abdulrahman al-Jassim assigned to referee the third-place playoff. The Croatia head coach, Zlatko Dalic, was less impressed, saying: \u201cFifa has now taken on a huge risk on itself \u2026 I hope that we will not be talking about the referee after the match.\u201d The English-language Qatar Tribune, meanwhile, was keen to stress that \u201cseveral British journalists have noted that Qatar has presented an outstanding model in its World Cup hosting\u201d. The small catch in that story? All of the people interviewed were working for the Fifa website. MBe\nToday\u2019s live match\nCroatia v Morocco, third-place playoff (3pm GMT, BBC One) Walid Regragui spoke on Friday of his desire to be \u201con the podium\u201d, which suggests a more purposeful approach to the third-place playoff than that shown in recent tournaments. Belgium beat a listless England four years ago while a traumatised Brazil succumbed meekly to the Netherlands in 2014. \u201cMy players still have that appetite, they want to finish well,\u201d said the Morocco head coach. \u201cFinishing well\u201d could be the key here, because if there\u2019s one area in which a fine side slightly let themselves down in Qatar it was in taking their chances. Croatia and Morocco shared a reasonably entertaining goalless draw in the group stages and each have improved since then. This should be well worth watching, even if tiredness and injuries \u2013 particularly in Morocco\u2019s case \u2013 may take their toll. TD\n\nThe internet reacts\nEven in a surprisingly dull press conference Gianni Infantino managed to provoke a reaction from many by casually announced there will be a 32-team men\u2019s Club World Cup from 2025, likely to follow the same format as the current Fifa World Cup (unless it is replaced by a 48-team one in 2026). His revelation was made even though no agreements have been made with the relevant domestic leagues, so you can imagine how this went down in some quarters.\n\n\n\nPlayer to watch\nAzzedine Ounahi We can expect Morocco players to figure prominently in the transfer gossip columns next month, and Angers will face a battle to cling on to the busy yet elegant Azzedine Ounahi, who has been an outstanding presence in one of the best midfields in this tournament. Ligue 1\u2019s bottom club could pretty much name their price, if so minded, for a player whose energy, creativity and intelligence have been fundamental to Morocco\u2019s run to the last four \u2013 both as an attacking presence and as an aid to that parsimonious defence. It is to be hoped he gets a full run-out once more on Saturday against Croatia, having come closest to scoring for Morocco when the sides met in the group stages, only to be denied by another of this tournament\u2019s emerging stars, the goalkeeper Dominik Livakovic. TD\n\nAnd finally \u2026\nAfter making jaws drop with his \u201cToday I feel gay\u201d press conference at the opening of the World Cup, there was much anticipation about what outrageous lines Gianni Infantino might spout in his closing press conference. It turns out he didn\u2019t say anything too outlandish at all, apart from lauding the Qatar World Cup as the \u201cbest ever\u201d. In fact, most of the reaction on social media was about how late the Fifa president was for his own show.\n\n\n"

                    "body": "On Friday, USA and Portugal will meet in Dubai for a winner-takes-all Test match, the prize the last place at the Rugby World Cup in France next year. It is by some distance the most important game in the recent history of American rugby.  The US will host the men\u2019s World Cup in 2031 and the women\u2019s tournament two years later. World Rugby has placed a significant bet. Executives are of course neutral but without wishing any ill to the Portuguese, anyone seeking to plant rugby union in the American consciousness will be mighty relieved should the Eagles make it into Pool C with Australia, Wales, Fiji and Georgia. When he spoke to reporters on Wednesday, the Eagles\u2019 head coach refused to think past the next 80 minutes. \u201cIt\u2019s a big game,\u201d Gary Gold said. \u201c[But] 2031 is of absolutely no relevance to this now in Dubai. We\u2019ve got a short-term goal. We want to get to the World Cup next year. We want to put a stake in the sand. That\u2019s all our focus is on. \u201cThere\u2019s another World Cup to go and then 2031 \u2026 it\u2019s really important that we don\u2019t get ahead of ourselves. We focus on what we can control, which is our performance and our behavior on Friday night.\u201d The Americans have had an unusually long time together, through a training camp, games in South Africa and now two games done in Dubai. Kenya (68-14) and Hong Kong (49-7) were beaten, momentum duly gained. But Portugal did the same, beating Hong Kong 42-14 and Kenya 85-0. Os Lobos (the Wolves) are slightly ahead on points difference and tries. AJ MacGinty, the Bristol Bears fly-half, will captain a US team missing the experienced centre Marcel Brache. The Hong Kong game, MacGinty said, \u201cfelt good on the pitch and when we are analyzing where we can take our game, what we need to work on in facing this Portugal side \u2026 We worked our socks off yesterday and poor Marcel injured his calf [but] the training session was really good. So the next man is ready to step up.\u201d The next man is Bryce Campbell, once of London Irish and now of the new Chicago Major League Rugby team, his former employer in Austin having followed Los Angeles out of the competition. A dispersal draft took place last week. Campbell has spoken of acknowledging such challenges at home but focusing on the job in Dubai. Other Eagles could be forgiven for having one eye on home. Gold marveled at the \u201cpersonal sacrifices guys have made, losing money to be here, staying away from families, they have never been away from home for this period of time. Vili [Helu, the Atlanta flanker] was saying to me just now it\u2019s the longest time he\u2019s ever been away from his wife. Paul Lasike [the Utah centre, once of Harlequins and before that the Chicago Bears], he\u2019s got two baby twins at home, four children his wife has to look after. \u201cAnd you know, it hasn\u2019t turned one bit from the intensity that AJ mentioned in training. I think people have to understand that these guys are not making thousands of pounds and living lives of luxury.\u201d The Eagles are in Dubai because they beat Canada but then lost to Uruguay and Chile. The home defeat by the latter in July was a horrible experience but MacGinty said the team was now in \u201ca wholly new environment\u201d. \u201cThe big [difference] for me is the intensity level, the fitness. The guys are pushing themselves and there\u2019s a step up I feel everybody\u2019s made from the summer.\u201d Drawing heavily on the Lusitanos XV which competes in the Rugby Europe Super Cup, Portugal have impressed all year. It could be the Eagles\u2019 best hope lies in taking the game to the Portuguese forwards. Gold has picked a heavy-duty front five, the front row including David Ainu\u2019u of Toulouse at loosehead and Saracens\u2019 Kapeli Pifeleti at hooker, the second row containing Greg Peterson of Newcastle, 6ft 8in and 273lbs of Australian-born, British-raised brawn. There are 157 caps in that front five, a total boosted by the Houston prop Paul Mullen and Cam Dolan, a NOLA lock once of Cardiff and with 62 games for his country. Balancing that out, the back-rowers, Helu of Rugby ATL and Cory Daniel and Jamason Fa\u02bbanana-Schultz of Old Glory DC, have just 12 caps between them.  Asked what he expected from Portugal, Gold said: \u201cThis is an incredibly good team, very well coached by [the former France wing and coach] Patrice Lagisquet. To have players playing Pro D2 and even now Top 14 [in France] is a sign of how much this team has grown. We go into this game with a huge amount of respect.\u201d  Noting strong Portuguese performances against Georgia, Argentina and Italy, Gold said he expected \u201ca real threat playing wide, an attacking threat, moving the ball brilliantly. They\u2019ve got a lot of confidence in their game plan. They\u2019ve got some quite experienced players in the front row, they can produce very tough forwards. We know what a monumental task this is going to be.\u201d The US have missed only one World Cup, in 1995. MacGinty, Dolan and Peterson have all been to more World Cups than Portugal, whose sole appearance was in 2007. A Portuguese reporter asked if that made the Americans favourites. \u201cI definitely don\u2019t think anybody\u2019s favorite,\u201d Gold said. \u201cI think it\u2019s 50-50 \u2026 it\u2019s going to be a great Test match. It\u2019s going to be a great spectacle. We are going to try to ask questions of Portugal and I know they\u2019re going to do the same for us. It\u2019s pretty evenly matched.\u201d  USA v Portugal kicks-off at 10.30am ET on Friday, shown in the US on therugbynetwork.com "

                    "body": "Ever since it won the right to host the 2022 World Cup, Qatar has been the subject of sustained critical scrutiny. A spotlight has been shone on the Gulf emirate\u2019s repression of women and LGBTQ people, and its punishing exploitation of hundreds of thousands of migrant workers. But the picture is incomplete. The fact is that the roots of Qatari repression extend well beyond Qatar, connecting the emirate to the supposedly liberal states of the west. Much of the discourse around the World Cup has carried the implication that abuses in Qatar are an outgrowth of a local conservative \u201cculture\u201d, as juxtaposed with more enlightened \u201cwestern values\u201d. In fact, the persistence of monarchical rule in the Gulf is the result of more than a century of collusion between local elites and the west. If we are serious in our objections to the abuses found in Qatar, then we need to consider how Qatari authoritarianism sits within a much wider system of power, violence and exploitation. The processes of state formation that brought the modern Qatari state into being are inextricably bound up with histories of capitalism and western imperialism. It was British imperial power that first integrated the Gulf states of Kuwait, Bahrain, Qatar, the UAE and Oman into the structures of the global economy with discoveries of vast oil and gas reserves sealing the region\u2019s status as a major material and geostrategic prize. To ensure British influence and privileged access to this prize, local monarchies such as the Al-Thani family in Qatar were built up and buttressed against external and internal challenges. Britain worked with these client elites to develop systems of internal repression designed to foreclose any possibility of nationalist forces overthrowing the monarchies and breaking ties with the west. Even after the Gulf states gained independence in the 1960s and 70s, scores of British civilians remained in their militaries and state bureaucracies, including in Qatar\u2019s, to ensure the regimes\u2019 survival and their correct geopolitical orientation.  In more recent years, Qatar has become one of the world\u2019s leading arms importers, with the regime\u2019s military muscle now provided by the United States, France and other western suppliers. These include the UK, whose contribution includes a fleet of Typhoon military jets. And with its al-Udeid airbase playing host to the forward headquarters of the US military\u2019s Central Command, Qatar sits right at the heart of western power projection into the Gulf, as it has done for more than 100 years. The peoples of the Gulf are no more or less desiring of basic rights and autonomy than the rest of the human race. If repressive monarchy has not given way to democracies and republics in the Gulf as it has elsewhere in the world, this is at least partly owing to a sustained and intensive intervention from the western powers on the side of the local elites. The false notion that authoritarianism in the Gulf is simply a reflection of regional \u201cculture\u201d has its roots in the Orientalist discourse of the colonial era. To this day, racist caricatures of an enlightened west encountering the backward despotisms of the Middle East obscures the relevant history and legitimises the west\u2019s role in the region. This self-serving mythology externalises and circumscribes the blame for human rights abuses in states like Qatar, while preserving a narcissistic sense of western innocence. The regimes themselves are happy to play along with these fictions, presenting themselves as visionary \u201creformers\u201d of societies hidebound by \u201ctradition\u201d and asking the west for patience as they struggle valiantly against the backwardness of their own people. The Saudi crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, was widely hailed as a \u201creformer\u201d until the bubble was burst by the murder of the dissident journalist Jamal Khashoggi among a wider, inescapable record of abuses. The Gulf regimes and their western allies have both told the reform story many times, but in truth the only reforms they are interested in are those that deflect political pressure and shore up the conservative regional order.  As an act of \u201csportswashing\u201d, this winter\u2019s World Cup fits squarely into these narratives. Playing into Orientalist notions of \u201ctradition\u201d versus \u201cmodernisation\u201d, the tournament is designed to showcase a Qatari regime heading in the right direction and deserving of the world\u2019s embrace. This is aimed at something more specific than burnishing Qatar\u2019s international public image per se. The real goal is to provide Qatar\u2019s western allies with an alibi for continuing the support that has been so crucial to the regime\u2019s longevity. It is soft power as the currency that buys hard power, with the entire global football community recruited into the transaction. As a Potemkin village of 21st-century capitalism, the 2022 World Cup is not a phenomenon separate from or alien to the west. It is a representative example of the world that western power built. The western brands sponsoring the tournament benefit just as the regime does from the continued exploitation of migrant labour that is making the tournament possible. And to the extent that the tournament serves to sportswash authoritarianism, it will be sportswashing an authoritarianism that has long been a joint venture between the west and Qatar. Only when the spotlight shines on the role of our own governments will true accountability for all this be possible.

                    "body": "England\u2019s footballers were greeted by the bizarre but joyous sight of hundreds of Indian expats serenading them with \u201cIt\u2019s coming home\u201d as they arrived at their hotel in Qatar on Tuesday evening.\nAs the England coach pulled into the five-star Souq Al Wakra hotel just south of Doha, the fans banged drums, blew trumpets and even crashed through a police barrier to get a better view. There were loud cheers for the captain, Harry Kane, and an even bigger one for Gareth Southgate, especially when the manager turned to wave.\n\nThere were also familiar chants of \u201cEngland! England!\u201d as well as the rather unusual \u201cSouthgate is our super coach! Sterling is our super star! Pickford is our super keeper\u201d.\nIt was another sign that this World Cup, the first in the Middle East and the first to be held in winter, will be very different to the 21 tournaments that have come before it.\nThere have been suggestions on social media that some locals are being paid by the Qataris to add a dash of spice, but the half a dozen or so fans the Guardian spoke to promised they were the real deal. They insisted they made their own jerseys, bought their own tickets to the games and supported England having grown up watching players such as David Beckham.\nThey were also happy to talk about the latest developments in the Premier League \u2013 and were clearly unhappy that a Scandinavian newspaper at the weekend had questioned their authenticity.\n\nSajidh, a 29-year-old mechanical engineer who did not want to give his full name, described suggestions that he and the others were receiving cash to be cheerleaders as \u201cfake news\u201d. He said:\u201cNone of us is getting paid. We are diehard England fans.\n\u201cMy favourite player was Beckham but now it is [Bukayo] Saka. If someone offered to pay us to support England we would turn them down. We are genuine supporters. Many of us grew up watching Beckham and Michael Owen. Our love is to this team.\u201d\nAnother fan, Niyas, from Kerala, estimated that there were 700,000 fans in his region back home and he showed the Guardian an 80ft cardboard cutout of Kane and a mural of the England team in his home state. He also showed a WhatsApp group of supporters with nearly 1,000 members.\n\u201cWe made these England tops ourselves,\u201d he said. \u201cNo one gave them to us. Argentina is the most supported team among Indians in Qatar, followed by Brazil. But then it is England.\u201d\nAs the England squad touched down, Kane insisted everyone was match fit and ready for the first game against Iran on Monday. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be massive,\u201d he said.\n\u201cI remember when we were out in Russia in our own little bubble. We saw all the videos from back home going crazy \u2013 it makes a big difference, it motivates us to be successful.\n\u201cWe want to make the fans proud and happy. Of course, there will be some in the stadiums \u2013 we always have great support \u2013 but most will be at home and we just want to make them proud.\u201d"

It is understood that Ukraine, which has been under full-scale invasion by Russia since 24 February, will host one of the tournament\u2019s groups if the bid is successful. Spain and Portugal confirmed two years ago that they would make a joint proposal to host in 2030 and the addition of Ukraine would give it a new dimension.\n\nAlthough Ukraine\u2019s national team are playing their home matches in Poland and the domestic league, which restarted successfully in August, is taking place behind closed doors there is confidence that any security concerns will be far less pronounced in eight years\u2019 time. Ukraine co-hosted Euro 2012 with Poland and has shown it can stage large-scale events in peacetime.\nThe Uefa-backed bid will face competition, including from a collaboration between Egypt, Greece and Saudi Arabia, and a South American proposal from Uruguay, Argentina, Paraguay and Chile. Last month the Uefa president, Aleksander Ceferin, said he believed Spain and Portugal would put together a \u201cwinning bid\u201d."

                    "body": "Five Australian women are suing Qatar Airways in the New South Wales supreme court over a 2020 incident in which they were forcibly removed from aeroplanes at gunpoint in Doha, and some intimately examined without explanation or their consent. The women are seeking damages from both Qatar Airways and the Qatar Civil Aviation Authority \u2013 owned by the Qatari government \u2013 over the \u201cunlawful physical contact\u201d and mental health impacts, including depression and post-traumatic stress disorder. On 2 October 2020, women on planes on the ground at Doha, including 13 Australians, were subjected to the examinations as authorities searched for the mother of a newborn baby found abandoned in a plastic bag in the departures lounge at Hamad international airport.  Women on 10 flights, including five Australians who were on a Sydney-bound Qatar Airways flight, were removed from planes at gunpoint and taken into ambulances on the tarmac. Some were instructed to remove their underwear and some were forced to submit to invasive gynaecological examinations for evidence they had recently given birth. Women who were examined said they were given no information by officials on why they were being forcibly examined, and did not have an opportunity to provide informed consent. The infant survived.  Sign up for our free morning newsletter and afternoon email to get your daily news roundup  According to the statement of claim filed in the NSW supreme court, three of the five women were subjected to \u201cunlawful physical contact\u201d. \u201cEach of the applications has suffered \u2026 from anxiety, depression, post-traumatic stress disorders and other psychological effects.\u201d The women have incurred medical expenses, and some have suffered economic loss \u201cas a result of needing to take medical leave from work due to the effects of the events on \u2026 mental health\u201d. Papers were served on Qatar Airways at the airline\u2019s Melbourne offices on Thursday. The airline has not responded to requests for comment from the Guardian. Damian Sturzaker, partner at Marque Lawyers, told the Guardian he was \u201cproud to stand with this group of brave women who have been forced to take on the Qatar government after it gravely breached their human rights\u201d. Qatar is an ultra-conservative Muslim monarchy, where sex and childbirth outside marriage are punishable by jail. The mother of the child has since been identified. She is not a Qatari national. Ahead of the football World Cup next month, the country has struggled to reassure critics its promises to protect women\u2019s rights are credible. Facing potentially devastating commercial and reputational damage after the incident, Qatar vowed to guarantee the future \u201csafety and security\u201d of passengers, without further details. The Qatari prime minister, Sheikh Khalid bin Khalifa Al Thani, conceded standard security protocols had been violated, and expressed his \u201csincerest apology for what some female travellers went through\u201d. \u201cWe regret the unacceptable treatment of the female passengers,\u201d he said. An airport security official was charged and prosecuted, and received a suspended prison sentence. But the Qatari government and Qatar Airways have failed to respond to entreaties from the Australian women to \u201cprovide a meaningful apology for the hurt and distress caused\u201d as well as \u201cprovide assurances to both the complainants and the international community that this kind of conduct will never happen again\u201d. Marque Lawyers has filed a complaint on behalf of the women with the Australian government\u2019s National Contact Point, under the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises. An initial assessment heard the airline\u2019s \u201clack of response\u201d was a further breach of their rights. The legal action brought this week against Qatar Airways, and the state-run aviation authority, has been lodged in the NSW supreme court. Under the 1999 Montreal Convention, which governs airline liability around the world and to which Australia and Qatar are both parties, an action for damages can be brought before the courts at the place of destination of the aircraft or in the territory where a passenger lives."

Updated at 9.40pm GMT    9.35pm    Speaking after the match, M\u00fcller seemed resigned to the end of his international career. He may not be the only one.      9.24pm    For the record, Costa Rica\u2019s second goal has been reallocated to Neuer. Just in case he wasn\u2019t feeling bad enough.  Updated at 9.25pm GMT    9.19pm    Here\u2019s another Opta stat which gives some historical context to Germany\u2019s back-to-back group-stage exits. The fallout is going to be swift and brutal.      9.15pm    Here\u2019s a good stat. Musiala started the game really brightly but, unfortunately, the dribbling wasn\u2019t matched by the end product.      9.09pm    There was lots of correspondence in the second half, but it all got a bit hectic there. This, from Kate Roberts, gives some insight into the fleeting joy in Costa Rica after Tejeda and Vargas had threatened a miracle. \u201cThank goodness for the brilliant Guardian footie blogs. I\u2019m in Costa Rica, stuck at home with Covid and no telly. Not the same as hanging out in a local bar to see the match but really enjoying your commentary. For a bit of atmosphere, the car horn honking and the whoops of joy of the whole of eastern San Jos\u00e9 come right in my bedroom window when there\u2019s a goal.\u201d     9.02pm   Full time, Costa Rica 2-4 Germany \u2013 the four-time World Cup winners are out!  Despite avoiding another upset, Germany have crashed out at the group stage just as they did at Russia 2018. Costa Rica roared ahead in the second half and briefly looked set to displace Spain as runners-up, but ultimately finish bottom of Group E. Both sides are left disappointed, then, but Costa Rica can feel proud of coming so close to the knockouts. Germany, meanwhile, face a harrowing inquest.   Updated at 10.10pm GMT    8.57pm    90+9 min Musiala continues to chase an elusive goal, but can\u2019t find a way past Navas.  Updated at 9.45pm GMT    8.55pm    It\u2019s all over at Khalifa International Stadium. Germany are out of the World Cup, with Japan going through as Group E winners and Spain as runners-up.     8.54pm    90+6 min Musiala gets in behind and looks certain to score, but Salas makes a vital intervention and hoofs the ball away.     8.53pm    Japan still lead Spain. This is nail-biting stuff.     8.52pm    It\u2019s actually a double substitution for Costa Rica, with Roan Wilson also swapping in. Tejeda makes way.     8.52pm    90+3 min Both sides make late changes, Matthias Ginter coming on for S\u00fcle and Anthony Contreras for Oviedo.     8.50pm    90+2 min There will be 10 minutes of extra time here. Havertz almost has his hat-trick, but can\u2019t quite apply the finish.     8.49pm   GOAL! Costa Rica 2-4 Germany (F\u00fcllkrug 89)  88 min Kimmich plays a lovely quarterback-style ball from deep to San\u00e9, who chests it down for F\u00fcllkrug to lash home. It looks set to be chalked off for offside but, after some consultation with her team and VAR, Frappart awards the goal.   Updated at 9.46pm GMT    8.45pm    Japan still lead Spain 2-1, meaning Germany are heading out. They can only hope that Spain magic up a late equaliser.     8.43pm   GOAL! Costa Rica 2-3 Germany (Havertz 85)  It\u2019s a hammer blow for Costa Rica. Gnabry flashes a cross to the far post from the right flank, setting up Havertz to score his second goal of the game.   Updated at 9.47pm GMT    8.41pm    83 min Musiala sets off on another mazy dribble, working an opening only to lift his shot over the crossbar.   Updated at 9.48pm GMT    8.40pm    82 min Matarrita gets a dangerous ball into the box, but R\u00fcdiger is first to it. Costa Rica are pushing for a winner and look as likely to score as Germany at this stage.     8.39pm    79 min Bennette presses R\u00fcdiger high up the pitch and makes him extremely uncomfortable, but he recovers and gets the ball back to Neuer.     8.36pm    Amid all the chaos, Costa Rica made a couple of substitutions. Jewison Bennette and Ronald Matarrita are on for Fuller and Venegas. Oh, and \u00d3scar Duarte has been booked.     8.34pm    75 min Magnificent goalkeeping. San\u00e9 gets in behind and squares to F\u00fcllkrug. He connects nicely, but Navas throws himself in the way and saves from point-blank range.   Updated at 9.49pm GMT    8.32pm   GOAL! Costa Rica 2-2 Germany (Havertz 73)  Germany equalise almost immediately. Costa Rica fail to clear their lines, F\u00fcllkrug flicks the ball to Havertz and he lifts a shot over Navas and into the back of the net. For a moment there, Costa Rica looked poised to go through to the last 16 at the expense of Spain. It\u2019s not over yet, mind.    Updated at 9.50pm GMT    8.29pm    There\u2019s a VAR check for offside, but the goal passes muster. Germany are on the precipice.     8.28pm   GOAL! Costa Rica 2-1 Germany (Vargas 70)  Wow. Costa Rica win a free kick. Campbell lofts a high ball into the box. Waston heads it back across goal. It bobbles and falls for Vargas, who pokes it past Neuer with an outstretched boot.     Updated at 9.51pm GMT    8.25pm    67 min Germany can\u2019t believe their eyes. Musiala hits the post again, clanging a shot against the upright from distance.     8.24pm    66 min Flick makes a double change, bringing on Kai Havertz and Mario G\u00f6tze for M\u00fcller and Raum.     8.21pm    61 min Germany hit the woodwork again! Kimmich gets down the right flank and whips a cross to R\u00fcdiger, who grazes the outside of the same post that Musiala rattled moments earlier.   Updated at 8.56pm GMT    8.19pm    60 min Germany come forwards with a glimmer of desperation. Musiala hits the inside of the post, leaving his teammates with their heads in their hands.     8.18pm   GOAL! Costa Rica 1-1 Germany (Tejeda 58)  It\u2019s all going horribly wrong for Germany. Fuller makes inroads down the right and floats an inviting cross into the box. Kendall Waston has roared forwards and smashes a header at Neuer, who can only parry it. Yeltsin Tejeda follows up to score from close range.    Updated at 9.52pm GMT    8.15pm    55 min San\u00e9 has a crack from distance. The ball sails harmlessly into the stands. Flick makes another change, bringing on Niclas F\u00fcllkrug \u2013 the hero against Spain \u2013 for Ilkay G\u00fcndogan.  Updated at 8.22pm GMT    8.14pm    High drama. Japan are now 2-1 up against Spain after a goal from Ao Tanaka. Germany are in big trouble.     8.13pm    53 min Klostermann picks out Leroy San\u00e9 on the edge of the area, only for San\u00e9 to fluff his return ball. It\u2019s been an ineffectual performance from the Bayern forward.     8.10pm    52 min Musiala gets in behind on the left and tries to pick out a teammate, but Juan Pablo Vargas clears. Germany squander the ensuing corner.     8.08pm    Big news from the other game in Group E. Ritsu Doan has brought Japan level with Spain at 1-1 which means that, as things stand, Germany are going out.   Updated at 9.53pm GMT    8.05pm    Flick seems to be looking for more control in midfield. Klostermann has displaced Kimmich at right-back, with the Bayern Munich man moving into the middle of the park.     8.04pm   Second half kicks off  We\u2019re back under way in Al Khor.     8.02pm    Both sides make half-time changes. Goretzka swaps out for Lukas Klostermann, while Brandon Aguilera makes way for Youstin Salas.     7.59pm    Neil Jones writes in, and he\u2019s disappointed in Germany. \u201cThomas M\u00fcller [is] past it, how is he on there? I know Gnabry\u2019s scored, but his main function seems to be to kick it at the opposition\u2019s legs. Standard of crossing lamentable. Clueless in the box. They\u2019re going to sneak through, aren\u2019t they?\u201d     7.55pm   Half-time  Germany were in complete control for the first 40 minutes, but the last five minutes illustrated how Costa Rica could still hurt them. La Sele don\u2019t create many opportunities, but they still have the potential to capitalise on individual mistakes and hit back on the counter. Another goal would settle Germany\u2019s nerves but, while they have had little problem creating chances, their finishing has been scattergun. With 12 shots \u2013 four on target \u2013 but only one goal to show for their efforts, Flick\u2019s side need to kill this game as early as possible in the second half.  Updated at 8.01pm GMT    7.48pm    45 min Germany bombard Navas\u2019s goal ineffectually, before Costa Rica burst forwards on the counter-attack. They have a momentary four-on-two, but Campbell can\u2019t get the ball out from under his feet and the danger dissipates.     7.46pm      Updated at 8.06pm GMT    7.46pm    41 min Case in point. Raum lets the ball bounce and Fuller latches on to it. He gets the wrong side of R\u00fcdiger and, suddenly, he\u2019s one-on-one with Manuel Neuer. He smashes a shot at goal, which Neuer brushes over with his fingertips. How Germany could do with another goal before half-time.   Updated at 9.54pm GMT    7.42pm    39 min Gnabry wraps his foot round the ball in the box and swings a shot just round the far post. Navas breathes a sigh of relief. The score steadfastly refuses to budge beyond 1-0.     7.40pm    35 min Musiala skips into the box once again, shooting wide from a promising position. Germany are well on top, no doubt about it, but they have let a few decent chances pass them by and, as they know all too well from their defeat to Japan, a 1-0 lead certainly isn\u2019t unassailable.     7.36pm    34 min Kimmich has a shot from distance which swerves wickedly in the air, almost wrongfooting Navas. He makes the save but spills the ball, scrambling to tidy up.   Updated at 9.55pm GMT    7.35pm    Daniel Stauss writes in, and he\u2019s not impressed. \u201cCosta Rica are giving the ball away so cheaply in the middle third. There\u2019s space there to get at Germany, but it\u2019ll never happen with so many easy turnovers.\u201d     7.31pm    28 min Costa Rica have their first half-chance of the game. Bryan Oviedo curls in a cross from the left which falls nicely for Joel Campbell, the mercurial former Arsenal winger. He attempts to hit it on the volley, but scuffs horribly wide.     7.29pm    25 min Musiala, who has been Germany\u2019s biggest threat, has a shot blocked inside the area. Germany have had 72% possession and six shots to Costa Rica\u2019s none, which gives some sense of the pattern of the match.   Updated at 9.55pm GMT    7.27pm    Richard Hurst shares his thoughts via email: \u201cThe HRWC started off with such promise of genuine upsets, but it looks as if we romantics will be disappointed again, with Argentina and Germany going through, and only Belgium going out \u2013 and how much of an upset is that, in truth?\u201d     7.24pm    22 min Gnabry and Musiala combine menacingly on the edge of the area, but the attack breaks down when the former fails to control a return ball.     7.23pm    18 min Costa Rica are doing their best to get service to Johan Venegas up front, but Germany\u2019s centre-backs are dealing with the threat well so far. Having come in for a lot of criticism, especially after the defeat to Japan, Niklas S\u00fcle has been reasonably self-assured, while Antonio R\u00fcdiger has been solid.     7.16pm    14 min Leon Goretzka beats the offside trap and gets a header on target from close range, but Navas produces a reflex save to deny him.   Updated at 9.56pm GMT    7.15pm    Meanwhile, at Khalifa International Stadium, Spain have just taken the lead against Japan via \u00c1lvaro Morata. That\u2019s good news for the Germans.   Updated at 7.33pm GMT    7.13pm   GOAL! Costa Rica 0-1 Germany (Gnabry 10)  It\u2019s a simple opener for Germany and no more than they deserve after a dominant start. David Raum gets down the left and whips in a cross to Gnabry, who glances a header into the far corner.    Updated at 9.56pm GMT    7.10pm    7 min Musiala dances into the box and hurdles several attempted tackles, but fails to get a shot away. Costa Rica are living dangerously.   Updated at 9.57pm GMT    7.09pm    Another reader writes in. From Kari Tulinius: \u201cOf all the amazing stories so far in this World Cup, I think it\u2019s getting underplayed how remarkable it is that Costa Rica go into the final game of the group stage still in control of their destiny considering they lost their opening game 7-0. If I think of other teams that got that kind of first-game shellacking, like Saudi Arabia in 02 or El Salvador in 82, they were out by game two. Costa Rica have shown immense character.\u201d  Updated at 9.57pm GMT    7.06pm    4 min Navas makes another save after Gnabry ghosts in behind and lashes a shot on target from a narrowing angle. The assistant\u2019s flag goes up but, regardless, it\u2019s been a shaky start from Costa Rica.     7.04pm    2 min Keylor Navas is called into action almost immediately, keeping out Jamal Musiala at the cost of a corner. Joshua Kimmich\u2019s delivery is cleared.     7.02pm   Kick off!  We\u2019re under way at Al Bayt Stadium.     7.01pm    We have some correspondence. Alexandra Fullerton writes in from a less forgiving time zone: \u201cA very good early morning to you! These 3am matches are killing me but here\u2019s hoping La Sele manage to do it! Once again Pura Vida and thank you again for the commentary. Entertaining and enlightening as always!\u201d Flattery, is it? More please.     6.58pm    The national anthems are done and dusted. Up next, some football.   Updated at 7.19pm GMT    6.58pm    Will we get a low-block masterclass from Costa Rica tonight? Before their collapse against Spain, they had conceded only six goals in 12 games going back to the beginning of the year. Their 1-0 win against Japan \u2013 with Keysher Fuller\u2019s winner going down as their only shot on target at the tournament so far \u2013 was far more in keeping with their reputation as rearguard specialists. Leroy San\u00e9, Thomas M\u00fcller and Serge Gnabry will need to be at the top of their game here.     6.42pm   Beyond the football  As the tournament approaches the knockout stages and events on the pitch take on a life of their own, addressing the human cost of this World Cup remains as urgent as ever. Here\u2019s some pre-match reading.          6.20pm    For those already criticising Frappart\u2019s appointment, Derek Rae, ESPN\u2019s lead Bundesliga commentator, has a concise response.      6.16pm   Frappart set to make history  Whatever else happens this evening, St\u00e9phanie Frappart will mark an important milestone. She is about to become the first female referee to take charge of a men\u2019s World Cup match, leading an all-female officiating team alongside assistants Neuza Back and Karen D\u00edaz Medina.    Updated at 9.59pm GMT    6.06pm   Germany team news  \u2026 and here\u2019s Flick\u2019s starting XI.    Updated at 7.04pm GMT    6.05pm   Costa Rica team news  Here\u2019s how Luis Fernando Su\u00e1rez\u2019s side line up this evening.      5.47pm   Preamble  Well, well, well. If it isn\u2019t Germany having an existential crisis at the World Cup, again. Hansi Flick\u2019s side come into this match bottom of Group E after a shock 2-1 defeat to Japan and a dicey 1-1 draw against Spain, meaning they need a win here \u2013 and a sympathetic result between Japan and Spain \u2013 to avoid going out at the group stage in a repeat of Russia 2018. Costa Rica could make for tricky opponents, having beaten Japan 1-0, or they could be utterly rubbish, having lost 7-0 to Spain. It\u2019s honestly hard to say.   Updated at 6.24pm GMT "

                    "body": "The Republic of Ireland manager, Vera Pauw, says it is right Uefa has opened an investigation after her players were filmed singing a pro-IRA songafter their qualification for their first World Cup.\nAfter being drawn in a treacherous group with Canada, Australia and Nigeria for the 2023 tournament, Pauw hopes the focus can soon turn to football and the significant inroads made by the country\u2019s governing body to address gender inequality.\n\nIreland\u2019s first major finals berth became mired in controversy last week when the Football Association of Ireland (FAI) apologised for a video that showed the team celebrating their qualifying playoff win over Scotland in their Hampden Park dressing room. In the clip, player are seen singing \u201cOoh ah, up the \u2019RA\u201d \u2013 words associated with support for the Irish Republican Army.\n\u201cWe did something wrong,\u201d the Dutch manager said. \u201cAs soon as you hurt one person, you\u2019ve done something wrong. But the players didn\u2019t mean anything. That\u2019s not an excuse, but our players are going out always to the schools, to kids, to clubs. We are always there to be a role model for others.\n\u201cSuch a shame that this happened because nobody meant anything with it. I hope that we go into football now,. There is a Uefa investigation, which is correct because there was a claim in it, and we need to face what\u2019s coming out. \n\u201cBut let me be clear: there\u2019s no excuses and I hope that we\u2019ve learned from it that you can sing the song your team is embracing, but you have to know your background.\u201d\n\nIreland are ranked 24th in the world and will make their tournament bow in the spotlight, as they face co-hosts Australia in Sydney on the opening day, 20 July. They beat the Matildas 3-2 in Dublin last year in what Pauw called \u201ca turning point\u201d that instilled \u201creal belief that we can do something and grow\u201d.\n\u201cWe are just going to live to the full and embrace it,\u201d she said at the draw in Auckland on Saturday. \u201cThe more pressure, the better. It\u2019s about a task that you have to execute, it\u2019s not about how many people are in the stands. The bigger the stage, the better, because this is what we dreamed for.\u201d\n\nThe women\u2019s game has grown exponentially in Ireland since 2017, when the national team went on strike after accusing the FAI of failing to provide adequate support, including being forced to get changed in public toilets on the way to matches and sharing tracksuits with youth-team squads. After mediation, they were granted improved earnings and resources.\n\u201cIt was a turning point,\u201d Pauw said. \u201cBut it\u2019s not only the players who demanded it and stood their ground, the FAI has responded in a way that no other associations have ever done. We have the best facilities, the same hotels as the men have, we travel in the charter [flight].\n\u201cWe had earlier equal pay than many countries including the Netherlands, who are only are getting it now and they\u2019re [2017] European champions and World Cup finalists.\n\u201cIt\u2019s turned good with the force of so many people. Not only the squad and the staff, but also the management and the press and the whole support of the nation. That togetherness is the strength of this team. It\u2019s not any more us against others, but it\u2019s all together and everybody pushes us to higher heights.\u201d"

                    "body": "Here they are, back in the bus, and there\u2019s something exhilarating about being on the move with a police escort. It\u2019s a special little part of the pomp and pageantry of a truly big event. Just like the sound of aluminum studs clack-clack-clacking in a stadium tunnel before kickoff, it\u2019s a mental and sensory cue that it\u2019s game time. It\u2019s on. The US team steadily moves through traffic, winding through the Eternal City, gladiators on their way to Rome\u2019s latter-day Colosseum, the Stadio Olimpico. Just like in Trinidad, they\u2019re once again playing the antagonist to the crowd favorites. It\u2019s them against an entire nation, and they\u2019re behind enemy lines. Inside the bus, the mood is, somehow, looser than it was on the way to the Czechoslovakia game. How to describe it? The feeling on the way to their first game was filled with ignorance. Now that they\u2019ve been stung, they feel a little wiser. And, oddly, a little more confident, even if they\u2019re the only ones. Someone pushes play on a boom box. It\u2019s a hip-hop song, and the beat sounds awfully familiar.  It\u2019s \u201cVictory\u201d \u2026 their celebrity-studded novelty rap song/video! Hoots and hollers light up the bus. John Harkes stands up in the aisle and starts dancing the Roger Rabbit, to more cheers. They aren\u2019t Italy, they aren\u2019t Brazil, they aren\u2019t Argentina. They\u2019re the United States men\u2019s national team, and this is their song. This is them. The mood is suitably lightened. \u2022\u2022\u2022 A couple hours before kickoff, they get another warm-up out on the Stadio Olimpico field. The field is like a putting green \u2013 but even this early, the stadium is nowhere near as quiet as a golf course. There are maybe 500 people in the stands, and it already seems noisy. By kickoff, there will be 72,500 more. All 73,000 fans are expecting a goleada \u2026 meaning a rout. A thrashing. A trouncing. A licking. The Italian press has already written the script for this game. They\u2019ve been whipping up the nation ever since the Czechoslovaks had their own goleada against the United States four days ago. Actually, they\u2019ve been dreaming about it since last December, when Sophia Loren fatefully matched up the US with Italy at the World Cup draw. Pope John Paul II \u2013 a former goalkeeper \u2013 moved forward the Corpus Domini parade happening elsewhere in town today by one hour so that Italians won\u2019t miss a single goal of this match. The LA Times describes the US team as \u201cwalking through the valley of the shadow of death\u201d \u2026 that \u201cthere may be a blackout in Rome from all the electricity consumed by the Italian side of the scoreboard\u201d \u2026 and that \u201cthe situation may be hopeless.\u201d The New York Times\u2019 headline in its article about today\u2019s game is \u201cOlympic Stadium or Colosseum?\u201d John Harkes stunned reporters earlier in the week when he was asked how much of a blowout he\u2019d consider to be a good result. \u201cA tie or a win,\u201d he responded to the press pack. Silence. \u201cA tie or a win,\u201d Harkesy repeated. \u201cLook, if we do lose, I want to at least show the Italians we can play.\u201d His fellow Jersey boy and buddy-cop counterpart in midfield, Tab Ramos, was more pragmatic. \u201cThis game is going to be more difficult because the Italians are better than the Czechs,\u201d Tab told reporters. \u201cThe first few minutes are going to be difficult to stay composed. Then it\u2019s only going to get worse. I said before the World Cup that we might play the best games we\u2019ve ever played and lose them all by 3\u20130 or 4\u20130. That\u2019s a reality. It\u2019s not something we\u2019re ashamed of.\u201d Then there was Paul Caligiuri, ever the beatific Southern Californian, with his own take. \u201cI look at it as an inspiration to play against the best, in the most spectacular environment imaginable,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s the time of my life, and I\u2019m going to make the best of it. I want to step up and take the challenge.\u201d The media have been talking about the record scoreline in a World Cup, since history might be about to beckon: It\u2019s a nine-goal margin, which has happened three times before. Oh, and this Italian team has not allowed a goal in its last 653 minutes \u2013that\u2019s seven straight shutouts. The Italian players already seem to be celebrating their victory, which is worrying their coach, Azeglio Vicini. \u201cI\u2019ve seen too much optimism here this week,\u201d he told reporters after practice. \u201cThere is too much talk of a high-scoring game, which I think we should forget about. We have to go for the two points and the mathematical qualification it will give us. We think the United States, having suffered five goals, will revamp their lineups and tactics and be even more determined to avoid such a result.\u201d \u2022\u2022\u2022 From the Stadio Olimpico locker room, the Americans can hear the noise. Chanting. Stomping. A hum. A white noise. Energy vibrating through the steel and concrete, and into their safe little bunker. Everyone\u2019s suited up. Bob Gansler and the other coaches are once again dressed for a special occasion, in navy suits. Here comes one more talk by Bob. \u201cGents, I\u2019ve said it before. You can\u2019t be in awe of a team, and you can\u2019t be in awe of a situation,\u201d he reminds them. What awaits them outside that locker door isn\u2019t 40,000 delirious Trinidadians all in red expecting victory. It\u2019s 70,000 Italian fans expecting a massacre. It\u2019s indeed beginning to resemble the Colosseum. And this time, the US are not about to face the finest players from a tiny island, they\u2019re about to face the finest gladiators in the world: Walter Zenga, goalkeeper for Inter. A back line of Franco Baresi of Milan and Riccardo Ferri of Inter, with Giuseppe Bergomi of Inter and Paolo Maldini of Milan the fullbacks. A midfield of Nicola Berti of Inter, Roberto Donadoni of Milan, Fernando De Napoli of (yes) Napoli, and Giuseppe Giannini of Roma. The forwards are Andrea Carnevale of Napoli and Gianluca Vialli of Sampdoria. These are the very best Italians in a country with the very best professional league in the world. Baresi is already a legend. Maldini, the son of the great Cesare Maldini, is quickly becoming one. Donadoni is virtually unstoppable, a man who\u2019s everywhere at once. Vialli is hailed as Italy\u2019s finest forward. He\u2019s scored against the US before, when they played his club team in the Italian Alps last summer. Italy are so strong that not even Roberto Baggio, The Divine Ponytail \u2013 the man who just joined Juventus for a world-record transfer fee \u2013 can get into this starting XI! Most of the US team don\u2019t even play for a club. What a contrast this is. So, once again, just like back in Trinidad, here they are in a little locker room with their back against the wall and their reputation on the line, and once again they\u2019re about to walk onto a grassy stage where a hostile crowd expects them to be executed. Another blowout would be a terrible look indeed for American soccer. And it\u2019d be a terrible look for each of these players before the eyes of the world \u2013 destroying any career hopes they have in the world\u2019s game. Same shit, different stakes. \u201cDraw on the closest experience you have,\u201d Gansler tells his troops. He brings up Trinidad and Tobago, a do-or-die situation. \u201cThe Czech game was a \u2018do\u2019 situation,\u201d Gansler says. \u201cAnd we didn\u2019t.\u201d Yogi Berra couldn\u2019t have said it better. But this, he says, is bigger. This one\u2019s another do-or-die. And just as his players are quietly, confidently up for this game, Coach Gans is too. He\u2019s got a trick up his sleeve \u2013 not a genius one, but at this level, an effective chess move need not be elegant, just unexpected.  Soccer tactics 101 dictates that the inferior team set themselves up to defend deep, then try to make the most of their few chances throughout the game with quick counterattacks. After the world joyously ridiculed the Americans\u2019 last game, Gansler knew that everyone expected him to set up his team in accordance with this well-worn playbook. Gans decides, then, to mix up the quick counterattacks. The Americans would be defending deeply, in three banks like a Macedonian phalanx. No surprises there. When the Americans do get possession of the ball, they will aim to strike quickly if the chance is there; but other times, they\u2019re to slow it down. Get control. Hold it up. Focus on stringing passes together. Actually retain possession. It\u2019ll be the last thing the over-confident Italians \u2013 and their goal-hungry fans \u2013 will expect. And the last thing the Italians want is their own crowd on their back. As he always does, Gansler simplifies the strategy for his players and gives each a basic, straightforward assignment: Marcelo Balboa\u2019s job as a defensive midfielder is to break up attacks, and when he wins the ball back, just feed it to Harkesy or Tab. Jimmy Banks is to stick to Donadoni no matter what, like overcooked pasta. Bruce Murray is to lead the line, win battles in the air, and hold up play when necessary. Peter Vermes is to drop deep and help hold up the ball and retain possession. If they each do their jobs and keep the game close, all they need is one single chance to present itself \u2013 which it will, if their game plan can throw the Italians off of theirs. The Americans clack-clack-clack their way into the tunnel, lining up tallest to shortest, as usual, waiting to come onto the pitch. They\u2019re in their white shirts with blue stripes, white shorts, and white socks. If this is to be it for them, at least they\u2019re going down in style. Morituri te salutant. Soon, the Italians appear, in matching white Diadora warm-up jackets. They\u2019re not Eastern Bloc giants like the Czechoslovaks. In fact, they\u2019re not big at all. But they\u2019re giants nonetheless. Tab is in awe of these players he\u2019s seen on TV and looked up to. All these stars \u2013 the world\u2019s best \u2013 are in front of them. Unfortunately, they\u2019re all on the same goddamn team! It\u2019s starting to sink in. But there\u2019s something different in the Americans as they\u2019re here in the tunnel this time. It\u2019s not in the pit of their stomachs, but in their heads and their hearts. They know, somehow they just know that they\u2019re not going to get their asses kicked this time. Even by these world-class stars. The noise of the stadium surging in from the end of the tunnel isn\u2019t just heard, it\u2019s felt. Almost time to go out there. The referees signal that it\u2019s time to walk out onto the field. John Doyle, who\u2019s at the front of the American line, looks over at the first player lined up for Italy, Donadoni, to begin walking together. \u201cNo, no, my friend \u2013 you go. You go,\u201d Donadoni says to JD. Sweet ... this guy\u2019s really nice, JD thinks to himself, as the United States team walk out by themselves onto the Stadio Olimpico field, across the track and onto the grass. Immediately a deafening, terrible sound cascades down on them from all directions: the bellowing of boos and the shrieking of whistling. Christians being thrown to the lions. It was a trick. The Americans got done again by the Italians. Moments later, the Italians strut out of the tunnel \u2026 one at a time, as the crowd roars for each of them. They\u2019re cheering, waving flags, shouting, and applauding. The fans here in the Stadio Olimpico have caught the delirium of tournament hosts: they become intensely patriotic, and the hosts\u2019 games are as much celebrations as they are sporting events. Tonight there\u2019s a festive atmosphere in the stadium. The energy is palpable \u2013 and not an edgy kind of energy, as if the hosts had to face Brazil or West Germany. No, this feels like a national holiday. Italy\u2019s tricolor flags are everywhere, in all sizes. Thousands of them! And they\u2019re all in motion. It\u2019s a spectacular sight. The Americans take in the sights: 73,423 people \u2013 far more than they\u2019ve ever played in front of before. They line up on each side of the referees for the national anthems: First is The Star-Spangled Banner. The Americans put their hands over their hearts and look off into the middle distance, focusing on the task ahead. Then, here it comes: the Italian national anthem, Il Canto degli Italiani. An entire military marching band is in formation behind the players, and they play the jaunty tune. There\u2019s nothing quite like standing in the middle of 73,000 people who are all belting out the national anthem of your opponent. You can do nothing but stand there and endure it. What a moment \u2013 a very, very intimidating one ahead of kickoff. This is what you face when you play the host country. The Americans are already keyed up for this game \u2026 but hearing this, oh man \u2026 this really gets the adrenaline going. Holy shit \u2026 this is it. It\u2019s 75F and humid at kickoff, 9pm. Rome time. As the teams take their positions to kick off, the noise is something entirely different. It\u2019s gone from celebratory to raw energy. The thousands of Italian flags are still swaying throughout the stadium. The Azzurri are in blue shirts, white shorts, and blue socks. Bruce and Peter stand at the center circle, ready to get the ball rolling. Under the stadium floodlights, the match ball is gleaming, sparkling white. Now the decibels are unlike anything these Americans have ever played in, by a long shot. Teammates shout to each other, but nothing comes out. So they jog over closer, and still nothing. The Americans can move five yards from each other and still they can\u2019t be heard. How are they going to play in this? Murray rolls the Adidas Etrusco Unico ball to Vermes, who passes it backward, and with that, the Americans are in the game of their lives \u2013 pupils dilated, adrenaline jacked, hearts thumping in their chests, laser focused.

As unsatisfying as that sounds, there is a precedent: the winners of the 2002 Champions Trophy were Sri Lanka and India.     11.36am    \u201cIndia have done this before,\u201d writes Tim de Lisle, \u201cright down to the match-losing fifty from Kohli.\u201d The Sky pundits are discussing whether they were too cautious, particularly at the start of the innings. World Cups do seem to act as a handbrake. I still don\u2019t think they were that far short of par, though. England won what turned out to be a good toss and batted incredibly. That said, this is a cracking statistic.  And so is this. \u2018Whisper it\u2019 indeed. If any Indian fans would like Booth\u2019s phone number, I have a nuanced attitude towards bribery.   Updated at 12.05pm GMT    11.34am    \u201cWhat an outstanding win!\u201d says Colum Fordham. \u201cNot in my wildest dreams did I think England would coast to victory over such a (potentially) good India team. \u201cFaced with three hours of teaching that clashed perfectly with the match, I managed to introduce my Italian pupils to the world of cricket as an excuse to follow the contest while allegedly teaching them English. They were a bit bemused to begin with but gradually became interested in the rules and were cheering for the players in red (no moral suasion or attempt to please teacher). The players in red are winning/losing\u2026 etc.     11.30am    Hales (211) and Buttler (199) have scored 58 per cent of England\u2019s runs at this tournament, and that includes extras. Fifty-eight is the operative number: that\u2019s how many runs Ben Stokes, the next highest scorer, has made.  Updated at 11.32am GMT    11.27am    How to finish a World Cup semi-final, part 1 of 1      11.26am    Right, enough of the celebrations, let\u2019s get this pessimism party started \u201cWhat an amazing game!\u201d says Jacob Reed. \u201cI\u2019m worried, though, that it looks like England at the Rugby World Cup in 2019\u2026 destroyed the All Blacks in the semi then fell flat in the final as there was nowhere else to go.\u201d But they also, as Mike Atherton has just pointed out on Sky, hammered Australia in the semis in the 2019 Cricket World Cup.  Eight flags for Liam Livingstone, which might be a subtle comment on the fact that Phil Salt, Harry Brook and Moeen Ali all won the Thanks for Coming award.  Updated at 11.49am GMT    11.25am   Match report  Simon Burnton had the considerable pleasure of being at the Adelaide Oval tonight. Here\u2019s his report on a mind-blowing England victory.      11.24am    More from Jos Buttler. He\u2019s buzzing  You couldn\u2019t ask for a better runchase. I ummed and aahed over the toss, but gut feel said to chase today. India are sometimes more dangerous when they know what target they need. I thought Adil Rashid was outstanding; that\u2019s the best I\u2019ve seen him bowl in a long while. I thought he was our best chance to pick up wickets and he got the key one of Suryakumar. The dimensions of this ground suited Chris Jordan and I thought he bowled fantastically well. I don\u2019t think CJ was thanking me too much for bowling him three overs in a row at the death. I thought it was an incredible effort. It\u2019s too soon to say whether Dawid or Mark will be fit for Sunday. We\u2019ve seen quite a lot of Pakistan recently; they\u2019ve found some great form. At the moment we\u2019re just excited to be in the final. We had the stress of trying to get through the group stages and now we\u2019re in the final.      11.19am    Jos Buttler\u2019s verdict  [Is that the perfect game?] It feels that way, against such a good side. We always want to start as fast as we can with the bat and be really aggressive. A long batting line-up gives you a lot of freedom. Alex was so hard to bowl to today. We complement each other well and he was fantastic today. We\u2019ll enjoy this win but we know there\u2019s one big dance to go.      11.17am    Rohit Sharma\u2019s verdict  It\u2019s pretty disappointing. I thought we batted pretty well at the back end, but we were not good enough with the ball. We just didn\u2019t turn up. It\u2019s all about handling pressure [in the knockout stages]. We have played enough IPL cricket to understand that. The way we started off with the ball was not ideal, which shows we were a bit nervy. You have to give credit to those openers too; they played really well. The new ball swung a bit for Bhuvi but not from the right areas. We wanted to keep it tight on the stumps. That\u2019s a little disappointing. If you don\u2019t execute your plans, you\u2019ll find yourself in trouble.      11.13am    A quick plug for the Spin      11.13am     The thoughts of Adil Rashid, who bowled marvellously and took the wicket of Suryakumar Yadav  Lovely. One more game and hopefully we\u2019ll get there. I thought we bowled exceptionally well \u2013 we were happy chasing 169. There was a bit of turn. You have to get used to being able to bowl in the first Powerplay, I\u2019ve been practising that so that I\u2019m ready if the captain needs me. [The openers] played magnificently. When they\u2019re in that form nobody can stop them. There was no chat about the approach \u2013 just, \u2018Boys, go do your thing.\u2019 The job\u2019s not done yet. One more game \u2013 play the way we play and hopefully we\u2019ll get over the line.      11.09am    The player of the match is Alex Hales  It\u2019s a huge occasion, India in a World Cup semi-final, and I\u2019m really happy with the way I played \u2013 it\u2019s as special as it gets. This is one of the best grounds in the world to bat on, especially in the Powerplay. I never thought I\u2019d play in a World Cup again, so to get the chance \u2013 in a country I love \u2013 is very special.      11.09am    So, 30 years on from Wasim Akram\u2019s ball of the millennium, England will play Pakistan in another final at the MCG. We thought their seven-match series was a World Cup warm-up; turns out it was a World Cup final warm-up.     11.05am    The partnership of 170 is the highest for any wicket in a men\u2019s T20 World Cup. Buttler can\u2019t stop beaming as he embraces his team mates. He set the tone by taking 12 off the first over from his nemesis Bhuvneshwar Kumar, and then Alex Hales went ballistic. Buttler almost caught him up with a starburst of strokes at the end.   Buttler 80* (49 balls, 9x4, 3x6) Hales 86* (47 balls, 4x4, 7x6)  And we still don\u2019t know who was down to bat at No3.     11.02am   ENGLAND WIN BY 10 WICKETS!!!!  16th over: England 170-0 (target 169; Buttler 80, Hales 86) Hales backs away to clatter a slower short ball from Shami over extra cover for four. It almost went for six. Dear me, this is savage. Buttler finishes an unbelievable runchase in the grand manner, pinging Shami back over his head for one last six. He takes over his helmet, leans back and roars to the heavens. That, surely, is the best T20 performance in England\u2019s history. They have marmalised a great India team with ten wickets and 24 balls to spare.   Updated at 11.12am GMT    10.57am    15th over: England 156-0 (target 169; Buttler 71, Hales 81) A quiet over from Axar Patel, two from it. Both batters have faced 45 balls; Buttler has a strike rate of 158, Hales 180. \u201cThis is like Brazil losing 7-1 to Germany,\u201d says Vivek Jaitly. \u201cOnly if India manages to take a wicket here.\u201d Ah but Brazil were hosts. That\u2019s what gave it an extra layer of WTF.     10.55am    14th over: England 154-0 (target 169; Buttler 70, Hales 80) Jos Buttler took a mid-innings break to admire Alex Hales from the non-striker\u2019s end, but he\u2019s back to his spine-tingling best. He dumps Shami over extra cover for four and then makes room to launch a 100-metre six straight down the ground. That\u2019s an unreal shot. He tries again next ball, doesn\u2019t get hold of it and is dropped by Suryakumar Yadav running back from mid-off. To compound India\u2019s abundant misery he can only punch the ball to the boundary for four more. \u201cI\u2019m all for a redemption arc but Alex Hales was banned for recreational drug use and the captain refused to pick him after this,\u201d says Niall Mullen. \u201cSeems tough but fair?\u201d I think it\u2019s the length of the ostracism that most people were unhappy about. I can see both sides, and not only because my subconscious is so terrified of cancel culture that I haven\u2019t expressed an opinion since 2018. Look, I\u2019m sorry, I just don\u2019t feel that strongly either way about Marmite.     10.51am    Another great stat from Tim  England spinners: 7-0-41-1 India spinners: 5-0-55-0  \u201cWasn\u2019t expecting that!\u201d  Updated at 10.51am GMT    10.49am    13th over: England 140-0 (target 169; Buttler 56, Hales 80) Hales backs away, Pandya follows him, and Hales muscles the ball over mid-on for three. Buttler scoops the next ball for four, a particularly good shot because Pandya followed him outside off stump. And then he reaches his half-century with a stunning flat six over midwicket. England are taking India to the cleaners.  \u201cAt the moment,\u201d says Harsha Bhogle on commentary, \u201cit looks like a contest between two boxers from different weight categories.\u201d     10.45am    12th over: England 123-0 (target 169; Buttler 42, Hales 77) Ravichandran Ashwin returns to the attack. He bowled a very good first over, even though it went for 12. England are so far ahead of the rate that they are able to work Ashwin around for low-risk ones and twos. Buttler hasn\u2019t hit a boundary since the last ball of the Powerplay; with Hales running amok, he hasn\u2019t needed to. There he goes again! Hales gets down on one knee to dump Ashwin over backward square leg for six more. That\u2019s his seventh six, which equals Jason Roy\u2019s record for an England opener in T20Is. The overall record is Liam Livingstone\u2019s nine, and it\u2019s imperilled. This is sensational stuff from Hales, up there with his amazing hundred against Sri Lanka in 2014. He slaughters Ashwin\u2019s last ball to the cover boundary to move to 77 from 40 balls. England now need less than a run a ball.     10.40am    11th over: England 108-0 (target 169; Buttler 38, Hales 66) Pandya\u2019s first ball is pulled flat and hard over midwicket by Hales. That\u2019s his sixth six \u2013 I SAID THAT\u2019S HIS SIXTH SIX - and it brings up the century partnership from just 64 balls. It\u2019s so easy to think of Hales as a punisher, and by heaven does he punish, but his shot selection has been immaculate tonight. We probably don\u2019t give him enough credit for his intelligence.  Updated at 10.40am GMT    10.36am    10th over: England 98-0 (target 169; Buttler 37, Hales 57) England won the Ashes in 2005 because Glenn McGrath hurt his ankle during a game of rugby. If they win this tournament, it might be because Jonny Bairstow decided to have a round of golf.  His replacement, Alex Hales, is batting formidably. He smashes the new bowler Arshdeep\u2019s first ball through wide mid-off for four, then survives a potential run-out chance when Buttler\u2019s straight drive hits the stumps at the non-striker\u2019s end. Hales was well out of his ground, but Arshdeep didn\u2019t get a touch. There are still five overs of spin remaining; if India are to pull off a stunning victory, they will be key. England need 71 from 60 balls.     10.31am    Drinks Rishabh Pant needs treatment, so the umpires have called drinks an over ahead of schedule. Rohit Sharma takes the opportunity to get his team in a huddle and ask them what the eff they\u2019re playing at.     10.28am    9th over: England 91-0 (target 169; Buttler 34, Hales 51) Buttler gets a peculiar all-run four. He scooped the new bowler Pandya to third man, where Shami tried a simple relay throw to the supporting fielder. And it all went wrong, big time. It went over the fielder\u2019s head and allowed England to turn two into four. \u201cThey could still lose of course,\u201d says Nick Butler, \u201cbut Hales showing in this and the previous two matches - all of which were must-win games, just how bizarre and damaging Morgan\u2019s excessive personal vendetta against Hales has been.\u201d I don\u2019t know. It felt harsh, but I\u2019m loath to judge without knowing exactly what happened. We shouldn\u2019t forget is that Hales would only have been a back-up in 2019 (although he would have played when Jason Roy was injured). One thing\u2019s for sure: that post-match interview the other day redefined the word \u2018awkward\u2019.   Updated at 10.31am GMT    10.22am    8th over: England 84-0 (target 169; Buttler 30, Hales 50) A lamentable short ball from Axar Patel is munched over cow corner by Hales. That\u2019s his fifth six \u2013 as Tim de Lisle notes, that\u2019s already as many as Hardik \u2013 and a single off the last ball takes him to an accomplished, occasionally brutal half-century from 28 balls. England need 85 from 72 balls. \u201cEvening Rob,\u201d says Phil Withall. \u201cWatching this pair bat, the way they are starting to dominate, they way their mindset is so perfectly predisposed to taking the game to India. I would like to retract my previous, petty comment. Bring on the trumpets\u2026\u201d Well, if you insist.   Updated at 10.23am GMT    10.19am    7th over: England 75-0 (target 169; Buttler 29, Hales 42)  Hardik Pandya was going to bowl, but because he was off the field for a while it will be Ravichandran Ashwin instead. Pandya can bowl the next over. Ashwin\u2019s second ball turns appreciably to hit Buttler on the pad. There\u2019s an appeal for a bat/pad catch to the keeper but the umpire isn\u2019t interested; nor is Rohit Sharma.  It\u2019s a really good over from Ashwin, with plenty of encouragement for India, but Hales keeps England moving with another sweep round the corner for six. He has 42 from 23 balls and is playing beautifully.     10.15am    6th over: England 63-0 (target 169; Buttler 28, Hales 33) Let\u2019s not get carried away. England were 70-0 after six overs against Sri Lanka and only just reached a target of 142. But jeez, they are going outrageously well at the moment. Hales sweeps Axar over backward square leg for his third six.  Buttler clunks a pull not far short of midwicket \u2013 but he ends the over by crashing a pull stroke over the same fielder for four. In their last three Powerplays, against New Zealand, Sri Lanka and now India, England have 181-0 from 18 overs.   Updated at 10.37am GMT    10.10am    5th over: England 52-0 (target 169; Buttler 24, Hales 26) Mohammed Shami replaces Bhuvneshwar Kumar (2-0-25-0). Hales backs away to pump his second delivery over mid-off for a big six. For the third game in a row, England\u2019s openers are doing serious damage in the Powerplay. Hales slashes between keeper and slip for four to bring up a rapid fifty partnership from 31 balls. I\u2019m pretty sure this is the first time in England\u2019s T20 history that they\u2019ve had three consecutive opening stands of 50 or more.   Updated at 10.14am GMT    10.06am    4th over: England 41-0 (target 169; Buttler 24, Hales 15) Now then. With two right-handers at the crease, the left-arm spinner Axar Patel is coming on. Buttler backs away to chip his first ball over extra cover for a one-bounce four. That\u2019s an imperious statement of intent. He tries a similar stroke next ball, but doesn\u2019t middle it and only just clears the fielder running back from cover. In fact it was Pandya, who must have come back on the field between overs. The ball seems to be stopping in the pitch a bit for Patel, and England are happy to milk the remainder of the over. Eight from it. England need 128 from 96 balls.     10.03am    3rd over: England 33-0 (target 169; Buttler 18, Hales 13) Hardik Pandya is off the field, receiving treatment to his left hand. It doesn\u2019t look serious, so I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll be okay to bowl.  It\u2019s Kumar to Hales for the first time. With Pant standing back, the England openers are walking down the pitch quite a lot to counter the swing. Hales does exactly that to launch an emphatic six over extra cover. A handful of ones and twos make it a really good over for England \u2013 12 from it.     9.58am    2nd over: England 21-0 (target 169; Buttler 17, Hales 2) The brilliant left-armer Arshdeep Singh, India\u2019s leading wicket-taker in the tournament, shares the new ball. Alex Hales is vulnerable to left-arm inswing \u2013 which right-hander isn\u2019t \u2013 and leading-edges the first ball through the covers for a single. Buttler thick edges through backward point for another boundary, which takes him to 16 from seven balls, but Arshdeep closes out the over very well. When Buttler drives a low full toss to mid-off, Kohli throws at the non-striker\u2019s end and seems to warn Hales about backing up illegally. Do bookies offer odds on a Mankad?     9.52am    1st over: England 13-0 (target 169; Buttler 12, Hales 0) Buttler walks down the track to his first ball, offering no stroke to an outswinger that is harshly called wide. India\u2019s response is instant \u2013 the wicketkeeper Rishabh Pant calls for a helmet and moves up to the stumps. Great stuff. Buttler reaches outside off stump to crack the first legitimate delivery of the innings through extra cover for four, then \u2013 with Pant now standing back again - does the same to the third ball. So much for England having a look. Kumar responds beautifully to beat Buttler with consecutive deliveries \u2013 the first wide and full, the second shorter and straight. And Buttler responds to the response with a measured stroke to the midwicket boundary. Blimey, what a start.     9.47am    Bhuvneshwar Kumar will bowl the first over. Of course he will.   Updated at 9.48am GMT    9.47am    \u201cWhat\u2019s your opinion of a par total in this wicket?\u201d says Chris Heron. Not a clue. But with the pressure of chasing, I reckon India are slight favourites. I\u2019m also worried about the short turnaround for Buttler, who must have been frazzled by that Pandya assault.     9.46am    The players are back out on the field. It\u2019s been said a gazillion times in the last 48 hours, but the contest between Bhuvneshwar Kumar and Jos Buttler could be pivotal. Don\u2019t be surprised if Buttler and Alex Hales take a couple of overs to get their eye in.     9.37am   ENGLAND NEED 169 TO WIN  For much of that innings, England had a degree of control. But with India there is usually chaos at the death, and today was no exception. They (I say they, it was mainly Hardik Pandya) smashed 88 from the last seven overs to take India to what feels like a par total. A word for Chris Jordan, whose figures of 4-0-43-3 don\u2019t do justice to some very good death bowling.    Updated at 9.51am GMT    9.36am   WICKET! India 168-6 (Pandya hit wicket 63)  Pandya times Jordan devastatingly over midwicket for six, then pulls a full toss for four. He whips the last ball to the boundary as well \u2013 but treads on his stumps in the process and is out hit wicket. Those four lost runs might be vital. Even so, that\u2019s an awesome innings from Hardik Pandya: 63 from 33 balls with five sixes, including 59 from his last 24 deliveries.   Updated at 9.51am GMT    9.33am   WICKET! India 158-5 (Pant run out 6)  Pant blazes a wide full toss for a single, which brings the rampant Pandya back on strike. He pings a yorker to the cover sweeper for a single, an outrageously good shot for one, and then Pant misses a wide yorker. Pandya charges down the wicket, deliberately running Pant out so that he can regain the strike. In the circumstances, that\u2019s smart cricket. (Had it been a catch, the new batter would have been on strike, but because it was a run out they are allowed to cross.) Three balls remaining.   Updated at 9.45am GMT    9.29am    Chris Jordan will bowl the last over\u2026    Updated at 9.49am GMT    9.29am    19th over: India 156-4 (Pandya 52, Pant 5) Sam Curran\u2019s last over disappears for 20! Pant makes room to carve his first ball over backward point for four, then flicks a sizzling yorker for a single. Another wide yorker is steered deftly for four by Pandya, who then pulls a monstrous six over midwicket. The over finishes with a vicious clip towards cow corner that not even the diving Stokes can stop. That brings up a punishing half-century from Pandya. He scored 4 from his first 9 deliveries; he\u2019s belted 48 from the last 20.  Sam Curran, England\u2019s premier death bowler, finishes with R-rated figures of 4-0-42-0.    Updated at 10.02am GMT    9.22am    18th over: India 136-4 (Pandya 37, Pant 0) That was a fine catch from Rashid, and it ends a seriously eventful over. The new batter is Rishabh Pant.  Updated at 9.23am GMT    9.21am   WICKET! India 136-4 (Kohli c Rashid b Jordan 50)  Virat Kohli is out, and if that doesn\u2019t isn\u2019t worth an exclamation mark then I don\u2019t know what is! But first, let\u2019s flash back to the start of the over\u2026 Jordan tries to surprise Pandya with a short ball first up. Pandya surprises Jordan by swatting it in to the crowd at midwicket. That\u2019s his second six, and he gets his third next ball with an incredible shot. Jordan didn\u2019t quite nail a leg-stump yorker, and Pandya helicopter-flicked it sweetly over backward square leg. Jordan, who was tagged at the death in last year\u2019s semi-final, must be having flashbacks. But his response is admirable: a bouncer that beats Pandya and then a perfect yorker that Pandya can only squeeze for a single. Kohli drives two through extra cover to bring up his usual half-century: 39 balls, four fours, one six. But he falls next ball, squirting a wide yorker to Rashid at short third man. Virat Kohli is out!   Updated at 9.49am GMT    9.16am    17th over: India 121-3 (Kohli 48, Pandya 24) Here comes Sam Curran. He\u2019s been England\u2019s banker at the death in this tournament, but this is an entirely different challenge. His first ball is short, wide and slammed savagely over the short square boundary for six by Pandya. Kohli punches the air with delight. The next ball is heaved to deep square leg, where the sprawling Hales does very well to save two runs. Curran nails a wide yorker that is scrunched down the ground, with the non-striker Kohli scarpering back for two. That\u2019s excellent running. But it\u2019s also an excellent comeback from Curran: six from the first ball, five from the next five. Three overs to go, and there is absolutely no consensus about what would be a par score.       9.11am    16th over: India 110-3 (Kohli 48, Pandya 13) Kohli smiles at his reprieve and then drives Jordan\u2019s next ball through extra cover for four. Glorious batting. A misfield from Livingstone gives him a single, and then Pandya pulls another to deep square. India score 10 for the third consecutive over.     9.08am   KOHLI IS NOT OUT!  Well, I thought it was plumb but in fact it was only clipping leg stump. That means it\u2019s umpire\u2019s call and Kohli survives. I can\u2019t decide whether that\u2019s a remarkably good decision from Paul Reiffel or a really poor one.  Updated at 9.10am GMT    9.07am    15.2 overs: India 102-3 (Kohli 43, Pandya 10) Chris Jordan has bowled 10,000 yorkers in the nets, all for a moment like this. If all goes to plan, he\u2019ll be out form this end. He starts inauspiciously, with a leg-side wide to Pandya, and then knocks Kohli off his feet with a sensational yorker. Paul Reiffel says not out but England go for the review. If it\u2019s pad first, it\u2019s plumber than plumb.  Updated at 9.08am GMT    9.04am    15th over: India 100-3 (Kohli 43, Pandya 9) Livingstone does indeed continue; I suspect this is Woakes\u2019s fourth over that he\u2019s bowling, which would love three from Jordan and two from Curran. After his usual watchful start, four from nine balls, Pandya smears a terrifying boundary just past the umpire\u2019s head. After a couple of useful dot balls for England, Kohli waves a superb boundary through extra cover. Not even Jordan, running round from long off, could stop that. India have scored ten from each of the last two overs. If they keep that up they\u2019ll get to 150 \u2013 but I suspect they\u2019ll be eyeing closer to 170.   Updated at 9.04am GMT    9.00am    14th over: India 90-3 (Kohli 38, Pandya 4) Kohli slashes Woakes past short third man for four, his first boundary since the seventh over. He is so good at vrooming through the gears at the death, so England won\u2019t feel remotely comfortable while he is at the crease. Woakes is wided when Pandya misses a hook stroke. It looked pretty clear to me. A single off every other delivery makes it ten from the over.     8.54am    13th over: India 80-3 (Kohli 31, Pandya 2) Livingstone returns, and Pandya edges consecutive deliveries just short of a fielder, first short third man and then backward point. There\u2019s a bit in this pitch for the spinners, which will interest Axar Patel and Ravichandran Ashwin. A good over from Livingstone, three from it. England have filled their fifth-bowler quota, though they might give Livingstone another one after that.  Updated at 8.59am GMT    8.51am    12th over: India 77-3 (Kohli 29, Pandya 1) Rashid ends another masterful spell with figures of 4-0-20-1. The only boundary he conceded was off his first delivery.   Updated at 8.59am GMT    8.50am   WICKET! India 75-3 (Suryakumar c Salt b Rashid 14)  Adil Rashid has picked up the big wicket! Suryakumar charged down the track and sliced the ball high in the air towards deep point, where Phil Salt took a simple catch. It was a really good delivery, slower and turning just enough to take the edge. Suryakumar goes for 14 from 10 balls; England will take that all day and all of the night.   Updated at 9.02am GMT    8.48am    11th over: India 74-2 (Kohli 27, Suryakumar 14) Ben Stokes returns to the attack. The first ball beats Suryakumar\u2019s attempted violence, but you can\u2019t keep him quiet forever. Or even 10 minutes. After a relatively slow start \u2013 4 from 7 balls \u2013 he lifts a spectacular hook over the keeper\u2019s head for six. He probably didn\u2019t mean it to go that fine, but he certainly intended it to for six. The next balls is blazed over extra cover for four. It\u2019s on! \u201cFar too pumped for any rational analysis here,\u201d writes Andy. \u201cPerhaps harsh on Brook! V good take from Curran though and great over from Jordan.\u201d     8.41am    10th over: India 62-2 (Kohli 26, Suryakumar 3) Suryakumar sweeps Rashid off middle stump for a single. The ball drifted in nicely, and for a split-second England thought he was going to be plumb LBW. Kohli, who is batting with formidable certainty, lifts two more down the ground. But then he berates himself for only managing to whack a full toss for a single. This is good stuff from Rashid, 3-0-17-0. Time for drinks.     8.37am    9th over: India 57-2 (Kohli 23, Suryakumar 1) SKY flicks his first ball to deep square for a single. \u201cDisagree that that was a minor chance for Brook (5th over),\u201d writes Andy. \u201cWent like a rocket but not at full stretch and got his full palm on... at least a half chance. Brook\u2019s fielding has been iffy in tournament in general.\u201d Tough crowd!     8.36am   WICKET! India 56-2 (Rohit c Curran b Jordan 27)  Chris Jordan, who is in for Mark Wood, replaces Livingstone. He doesn\u2019t nail his yorker second ball, and Rohit pings him imperiously over extra cover for a one-bounce four. The non-striker Kohli punches his bat in celebration. But \u2013 pick this cheesy segue out \u2013 it\u2019s England who are celebrating later in the over when Rohit falls for 27! He smeared Jordan high over midwicket, and Curran ran in from the boundary before diving forward to take a superb two-handed catch. Ladies and gentlemen, it\u2019s time for Suryakumar Yadav.    Updated at 9.00am GMT    8.32am    8th over: India 51-1 (Rohit 23, Kohli 22) A moment of fortune for Rohit, who has a hack at Rashid and slices the ball on the bounce to short third man. There\u2019s a bit of turn for Rashid and India are happy enough with five singles from the over. Rohit has 23 from 24 balls, Kohli 22 from 19.     8.28am    7th over: India 46-1 (Rohit 21, Kohli 19) Liam Livingstone replaces Sam Curran (2-0-11-0). Kohli smashes the first ball he faces back over the bowler\u2019s head for four, a shot of delicious contempt, and there are eight runs from the over. This, as Mike Atherton notes, is where England would love to have Mark Wood around to cause some mayhem. And this is another absurd Kohli stat.   Updated at 8.29am GMT    8.26am    6th over: India 38-1 (Rohit 20, Kohli 12) A statement of intent from Rohit, who sweeps Adil Rashid\u2019s first ball emphatically for four. There was a time when Rashid went nowhere near the Powerplay but he has bowled the sixth over a few times in this tournament, most crucially against Sri Lanka. Rashid pulls the over back pretty well, with just three singles from the last five balls. There was almost the chance of a return catch when Rohit smacked the last ball back towards the bowler. Rashid dived low to his left but couldn\u2019t quite get there. \u201cEngland have 11 batters, seven bowlers and two wicketkeepers and a captain who seems to understand his options,\u201d says Gary Naylor. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t guarantee success, but it doesn\u2019t half help.\u201d True, although so does having specialists like Virat, Suryakumar, Bhuvneshwar and Arshdeep.  Updated at 8.27am GMT    8.22am    5th over: India 31-1 (Rohit 14, Kohli 11) Rohit\u2019s off and running. He hits Curran through midwicket for successive boundaries, a languid clip followed by a flamboyant tennis shot. He smashes the next ball towards backward point, where the flying Brook puts down an almost impossible one-handed chance. Technically it\u2019s a drop; in reality he saved three runs. An eventful over continues with an unsuccessful LBW appeal against Kohli. I thought England might review, just because it\u2019s Kohli, but Jos Buttler was calm enough to realise it had pitched outside leg. This is great stuff!   Updated at 8.39am GMT    8.18am    4th over: India 21-1 (Rohit 5, Kohli 10) Blimey. Kohli drives Woakes\u2019s first ball magnificently over extra cover for six. A single takes him to 1100 runs in T20 World Cups, at the obscene average of 85, and there are 10 runs from the over. Rohit is struggling to time it, though we\u2019ve seen him do this in the past and end with 110 off 70 balls. \u201cI wonder if Buttler\u2019s decision to bowl first is a self-challenge?\u201d says John Starbuck. \u201cThere have been a fair few wicketkeeper-openers and it\u2019s always seemed odd to me, since after a full innings of keeping they have to get their batting gear on and play a hugely important role. Are there any stats about the really good keeper-openers, especially those who captain, and their success rates?\u201d You want to talk about this now? (Buttler\u2019s record isn\u2019t very good when opening, captaining, keeping and batting second: 93 runs at 13.28.)     8.13am    3rd over: India 11-1 (Rohit 4, Kohli 2) Sam Curran angles his first ball across Kohli, who pushes nervously and is beaten. The next ball is shorter and does take the edge, but it drops just short of Moeen at slip. Sheesh, that was close.  Curran concedes just a single from a terrific over, which ends with an unsuccessful (and more than a little optimistic) LBW appeal against Rohit. England have started really well.     8.09am    2nd over: India 10-1 (Rohit 4, Kohli 1) Evening Virat. (PS: Virat loves Adelaide.)  Updated at 8.10am GMT    8.08am   WICKET! India 9-1 (Rahul c Buttler b Woakes 5)  Gottim! Chris Woakes strikes with his fourth ball. It kicked from back of a length, and Rahul edged a flashing cut stroke through to Jos Buttler. That was smart bowling from Woakes, whose first three deliveries had been full and straight, too straight in fact, to Rohit Sharma. This was much shorter, much wider, and seemed to take Rahul a bit by surprise.     Updated at 8.23am GMT    8.03am    1st over: India 6-0 (Rahul 5, Rohit 1) And they\u2019re off. Stokes\u2019s first ball is a wide outswinger that KL Rahul back cuts for four. \u201cThis looks, already, a very, very good pitch,\u201d says Ravi Shastri, after two balls. There\u2019s a bit of swing for Stokes, and Rohit Sharma is beaten chasing a full, wide delivery. Rohit pushes the next ball to mid-off to get off the mark, and then Rahul plays and misses at an excellent delivery. A fascinating first over, with something for everyone. Okay not everyone. \u201cGood evening from Brisbane,\u201d says Phil Withall. \u201cI have a small problem. I want England to win, I really want England to win. However, the prospect of 100,000 Indian and Pakistani fans in the MCG is rather exciting. The repetitive drone that is the Barmy Army does get more than a tad repetitive for my tastes. I may be being unfair, I admire their undying support and commitment but the trumpet\u2026\u201d You want to talk about trumpets now?   Updated at 8.12am GMT    7.57am    Ben Stokes will bowl the first over. England would love an early wicket or seven.  Updated at 7.59am GMT    7.56am    The players line up for the anthems. Some look relaxed, others intense. There\u2019s more than one gameface for an occasion like this.    Updated at 8.10am GMT    7.52am         7.45am    I\u2019m off to grab a coffee. See you in a bit for \u2013 gulp \u2013 India v England in the World Cup semi-final.     7.44am    \u201cRob,\u201d says Yog Wadhwa, \u201cIndians are without their first-choice fast bowler and spinning allrounder - Jasprit Bumrah and Ravindra Jadeja.\u201d I know, I was being flippant. It shows the depth of both squads that the first XIs still look so strong. I\u2019d fancy an India C team to make the semi-finals.   Updated at 8.03am GMT    7.40am    \u201cYour mention of India winning the last four series between the teams got me thinking about the unpredictability of T20 as the chaos theory version of cricket,\u201d says Tom Van der Gucht. \u201cEverything, at some point, as to happen: England are therefore due a win against them... Hopefully\u2026  \u201cBut, in terms of the cricketing gods playing a larger game with the teams merely their chess pieces, a final between Pakistan and India would be the more glorious conclusion\u2026 So, I suppose it comes down to the old clash between science and religion as to who will progress.\u201d William Goldman knew a lot about cricket.     7.38am    England are without almost half of their best T20 XI \u2013 Bairstow, Malan, Archer, Wood and Topley. Let\u2019s get the excuses in early, eh.   Updated at 8.00am GMT    7.35am   Team news: Wood misses out  Mark Wood has failed his fitness test and is replaced by Chris Jordan. That might be a blessing in disguise for England, although of course England would love Wood\u2019s breathtaking pace. The only other change is Phil Salt for Dawid Malan. Salt is carded to bat at No3, though Eoin Morgan says he would open with him because of his ability to go hard from ball one in the Powerplay. India are unchanged, which means Rishabh Pant \u2013 another hitter who is very strong square of the wicket \u2013 is preferred to Dinesh Karthik. Look at that middle order, and gulp if you\u2019re an England fan: Kohli, Suryakumar, Pant, Pandya. India KL Rahul, Rohit Sharma (c), Virat Kohli, Suryakumar Yadav, Rishabh Pant (wk), Hardik Pandya, Axar Patel, Ravichandran Ashwin, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Mohammed Shami, Arshdeep Singh. England Buttler (c/wk), Hales, Salt, Stokes, Brook, Ali, Livingstone, Curran, Woakes, Jordan, Rashid.  Updated at 7.46am GMT    7.32am   England win the toss and bowl  Well that\u2019s interesting. England have been nervous chasers this year, but it\u2019s been their preferred approach since the revolution in 2015. Rohit Sharma drily notes that India would have batted anyway.  Updated at 7.53am GMT    7.21am    It\u2019s a beautiful evening in Adelaide, so you can put the DLS sheet away. The pitch is used, though it\u2019s nearly a week since the last game so the curator has had plenty of time to freshen it up. All the commentators think it looks like a belter. The toss isn\u2019t straightforward, not least because \u2013 absurd statgasm alert \u2013 all 11 T20Is on this ground have been won by the team that lost the toss. Psychologically, batting first important for England but the can come on nicely under the lights.  Updated at 7.37am GMT    7.17am    Early team news Dawid Malan is definitely out with a groin injury, and Mark Wood is doubtful. Phil Salt and Chris Jordan \u2013 whose yorkers are a good option on a ground with such short square boundaries \u2013 are likely to come in. India have one big decision to make: Dinesh Karthik or Rishabh Pant.      7.15am    Simon Burnton\u2019s big-match preview      7.00am   Preamble  At last. Since white-ball cricket was invented in 2015, England and India have been the best teams in the world. But in that time, they have danced around each other at major tournaments. They\u2019ve met only once, never in the knockout stages. They were on course for a humdinger of a final in 2016 (World T20), 2017 (Champions Trophy) and especially 2019 (World Cup), but on each occasion one of them was beaten in the semi-finals. They won\u2019t meet in the final this year either, but we\u2019ll happily make do with a blockbusting semi-final: India v England in Adelaide for the right to play \u2013 oh yes \u2013 a rampant Pakistan in the final on Sunday. It\u2019s been a long time coming. But unlike many long-awaited rumbles \u2013 Mayweather v Pacquiao, Tyson v Lewis, Barlow v Baldwin \u2013 this will take place with both parties close to their peak. Though England and India each have a bigger rival, their matches still have a unique intensity. (Don\u2019t mention the M word, but keep an eye out for it if the game gets fractious.) There is also huge mutual respect, fostered mainly through the IPL. Both teams recognise in each other the thing that elite sportsfolk crave the most: a worthy adversary. India go into today\u2019s game as slight favourites. They\u2019ve won their last four T20 series against England, which must count for something; they are No1 in the world rankings and have played better cricket than England in this tournament \u2013 even though, paradoxically, they were closer to the brink during their win over Bangladesh. There\u2019s also a argument that India are under more pressure to win \u2013 firstly because they haven\u2019t won a global tournament since 2013, secondly because they are India, thirdly because they are India. England, as an endearingly candid Moeen Ali said the other day, would like another white-ball trophy to confirm their greatness. They have a history of raising their game for the toughest opponents, certainly at World Cups, and a few key players \u2013 Jos Buttler, Alex Hales, Mark Wood (though he is an injury doubt), Sam Curran \u2013 are bang in form. If you are into the whole positive-accentuation thing, those who aren\u2019t in form are due. Buttler\u2019s new-ball contest with Bhuvneshwar Kumar, who has caused him all sorts of trouble in the recent past*, could be vital. England also need plans for Virat Kohli, who averages 123 in this tournament and a scandalous 84 at all T20 World Cups \u2013 and for Suryakumar Yadav, the freest spirit in world cricket. Suryakumar should love the short square boundaries at the Adelaide Oval. England could do with \u2013 here comes the cheesy pun \u2013 a bit of blue-SKY thinking, because nobody seems to have a clue how to bowl to a man who can hit any ball for six. It might just be an extended purple patch, but at the moment it feels like he is redefining middle-order batting. He has a T20I strike rate of 180, and abracadabrad 117 from 55 balls against England in the summer. The good news for England is that they won that game. The bad news is that it was a dead rubber because they\u2019d already lost the series. In short, nobody knows anything, but it\u2019s England v India in a World Cup knockout game for the first time since Graham Gooch\u2019s sweepathon in 1987**. If your mouth isn\u2019t watering, you should seek urgent medical advice. * In T20Is Buttler has scored 30 from 32 balls off Bhuvneshwar \u2013 and been dismissed five times ** The infamous group game in 1999 was effectively a knockout, though that only became apparent at the start of the second innings  Updated at 7.43am GMT "

                    "body": "\u2018Too many people have died to elevate a country\u2019s prestige\u2019\nMy first World Cup was France 98. I was on my summer holidays from school and watched every game. It was magical to see Dennis Bergkamp score against Argentina, the intrigue of Ronaldo before the final and Zizou becoming an icon. They are some of my most cherished memories. Since then it\u2019s been the best four weeks of my life every four years.\nI\u2019ve not been excited at all by this World Cup. I\u2019m not an expert on human rights and would never claim to know more than the person next to me, but it was clear that the authorities in Qatar had no intention of treating workers with dignity. I feel the main failure and most blame should be pointed at Fifa. They knew what they were doing and showed the disdain they truly have for human worth by sending the World Cup there. The World Cup is a summer event. Such a big event needs to be held in a country that has the space and infrastructure. And too many people have died to elevate a country\u2019s prestige; that\u2019s just not right. Daire Sweeney, Ireland\n\u2018This is an immoral, false tournament\u2019\nI\u2019m normally very excited for a World Cup. I live in the US and being a soccer fan here means you are part of a special club of people who follow the game either early in the mornings or late at night. It\u2019s a good way to be social, get to know people, and I made my best friends here through watching or playing the game. The World Cup also wakes up neutrals.\nBut I am boycotting. I haven\u2019t watched a single minute of the qualifiers and I am about to suspend my football podcast feeds \u2013 about eight podcasts a week, from the Guardian and other places \u2013 to avoid World Cup chat. I do not know what I will do with myself; I\u2019m debating watching classic matches from previous World Cups, and I will be watching more American football (which is a totally non-problematic sport with no human rights issues whatsoever, no siree). I\u2019m aware that this is somewhat hypocritical, but show me a professional sport and I\u2019ll show you some corruption, hypocrisy and malfeasance. I\u2019m especially frustrated as a USA v England game would usually be a big event for me and my friends.\nI have no issue with the World Cup being taken to different parts of the globe, but with each World Cup we are getting more and more wasteful and outlandish. South Africa and Brazil are saddled with stadiums that lie unused. Russia abuses human right and has an appalling outlook on homosexuality. Qatar, however, feels beyond the pale. The World Cup should be the best players performing on the biggest stage \u2013 we\u2019re patently not getting that because of the compressed schedule. Doha is clearly unsuited to hosting so many fans. And a country that outlaws gay people means excluding fans. If those are your laws, fine, but you don\u2019t get to host citizens of the world for a tournament unless you welcome everyone. Everyone. Then there are the human rights abuses. We can\u2019t even confirm how many victims there have been because of a lack of transparency from the government. This is an immoral, false tournament. Thomas Bilous, an England fan in the US\n\n\u2018It is appalling yet entirely unsurprising\u2019\nI would normally be very excited about getting together with neighbours to watch games at each other\u2019s houses with much joy and celebration. But I will be completely boycotting this year. Some of my neighbours are a bit surprised, but I can\u2019t support it in any way. I have a trans daughter and there is no way I can support this World Cup if she\u2019s not welcome or would be in danger if she attended. The human rights issue and the treatment of the workforce are even worse issues, of course. It is appalling yet entirely unsurprising that Fifa thought they could get away with this. Jonathan Mowll, England\n\u2018I hope Qatar does a fine job and silences its critics\u2019\nI won\u2019t be doing anything differently this year and will watch any matches I can. I find all the boycotting talk a little late in the day. If fans were upset, they should have been making a fuss 12 years ago. Many people seem to be jumping on the boycott bandwagon \u2013 and most people in the UK are probably making judgements without knowing much about the country and its people.\nI was delighted when Qatar won the right to host the tournament. I lived in Qatar for 12 years and have great affection for the country. Why shouldn\u2019t a small country host the World Cup? Why should fans have to pay out thousands to travel all over a big country, or worse, move between two or even three countries? A compact city has some advantages. \u2028I understand the criticism of Qatar but it\u2019s not the only host country with less than perfect history. Qatar is a young country and not everything is perfect, but some of the criticism is unwarranted. I hope they do a fine job and silence their critics. Helen Bennett, a retired English teacher\n\n\u2018Quite frankly, I find the pile-on on Qatar quite appalling\u2019\nI am insanely and unreasonably excited to be attending the World Cup in Qatar. Quite frankly, I find the pile-on on Qatar quite appalling, especially the identity of the countries piling on. Qatar\u2019s human rights record is appalling but, as someone born in Nigeria, I have a different view of who the bad guys and good guys are in global affairs.\nWhile Qatar could do so many things better, I find the idea of boycotting Qatar, when I would have no qualms traveling to England or France, quite laughable. On the list of culprit countries in my mind \u2013 that is countries who have historically meted (and are currently meting) out unspeakable atrocities on my kind \u2013 Qatar does not register in the top 20.\nIt is a bit silly on the part of Qatar to host this World Cup. I cannot see how it is beneficial to them. Otherwise, I am insanely excited. I am old enough to remember how badly the international media denigrated South Africa as hosts in 2010. The racial dimensions to these discussions are quite apparent to me. That said, I hope that Qatar will seize this opportunity to reform and become a more open state. Emmanuel Oga, a Nigerian-born American\n\n\u2018Football relies on sponsors so I\u2019ve stopped using their products\u2019\nI always enjoy watching the best playing the best and am from Canada so, as this is only our second appearance at a World Cup, I should be even more interested. That said, what has been allowed to happen with these finals is a human and sporting disgrace. Even though Canada qualified, I almost wish they boycotted. The sport relies on its sponsors so I\u2019ve stopped using their products. I wish others would too. It\u2019s a disgrace and embarrassment to the game and goes to show that money trumps everything. It disgusts me. Nick Willcocks, a Canada fan in Turkey\n\u2018There will be no dancing in the street\u2019\nNormally, the World Cup is the highlight of the sports year for me. I remember watching England games in the pub at 8am when it was in Japan and South Korea. I watch every game and the excitement usually starts a year or more before the tournament.\nI\u2019d find it hard to boycott the entire tournament. A part of me feels it would be right to keep the TV off, but it\u2019s not the players\u2019 fault the tournament is being played in Qatar. As a dual US and British citizen, I don\u2019t think I could turn away from the USA v England game. I feel the same about the later rounds, especially the final. I will watch fewer games and do not intend to celebrate this tournament by going to the bars. If England or USA pull off some kind of miracle and win the tournament, I shall politely applaud the team. There will be no dancing in the street. Matthew Dunford, an Englishman in the US\n\n\u2018Sportswashing is killing our game\u2019\nI normally watch all the games and, even though I am a grown man, I usually fill out a World Cup wallchart. But I can\u2019t and won\u2019t watch this year. I\u2019ve banned myself from social media and comments about this tournament. I have stopped listening to the Guardian\u2019s football podcast. I understand you have to cover it, but that doesn\u2019t mean I have to be a part of your audience. It\u2019s scandalous that this tournament is going ahead. They could not have made it more plain that the principle of this World Cup is to maximise revenue. Sportswashing is killing our game. For example, I used to have a soft spot for Newcastle but can\u2019t watch them. I have a choice about the World Cup and have decided to sit this one out. I resent Fifa, the so-called \u201cguardians of the game\u201d, for denying me the passion of a tournament I\u2019ve been watching for 50 years. Andrew Paget, a West Ham fan living in the US\n\u2018I simply wouldn\u2019t enjoy watching it\u2019\nI\u2019m a football fan and an F1 fan \u2013 it\u2019s pretty hard to follow either without making some sort of moral adjustment to matches and races backed, sponsored or located in oil-rich regimes with questionable human rights records. But something about Qatar hits differently. So many journalists and papers have done an excellent job shedding light into the horrific human cost of building these stadiums \u2013 and so many human rights organisations have provided accounts of the physical and financial abuses of migrant labourers. And most importantly, the firsthand accounts of these workers are impossible to ignore.\nI don\u2019t think my boycott will make a difference. Enough people will watch that it will not be noticed. But I find my unease has grown so strong, my distaste so impossible to ignore, that I simply wouldn\u2019t enjoy it. Best of luck to the players and teams, who deserved better. I won\u2019t be watching. No World Cup could better reflect the corruption at the heart of international football than this one. It is both an absolute indictment, and perfect definition, of what Fifa is. Scott Connolly, Liverpool\n\u2018Russia was hardly a paradise of human rights\u2019\nBoycotting will have sod all effect on the Qatari regime. A boycott might have been effective before the hosting decision was made or around the time it was announced. It was a bizarre decision to stage it in Qatar and I\u2019m unhappy about the workers\u2019 rights and human rights violations. That said, it needs to be put into perspective. Four years ago the World Cup was staged in Russia, hardly a paradise of human rights. In 1978, which I am old enough to recall, the bloody thing was staged in Argentina, where the junta was well on its way to offing 30,000 of its own citizens. So Fifa has form on this. Plus \u00e7a change, plus c\u2019est la m\u00eame chose as Michel Platini might have said. Jonathan Smallbone, a trade union official\n\n\u2018I will do a partial boycott\u2019\nI am a lifelong football fan who always looks forward to the World Cup. I remember vividly watching the 1998 final as a seven-year-old with my father and grandfather. Football has been a huge part of my life ever since.\nI have decided I will do a partial boycott this year. I am too big of a fan to completely withdraw myself from the tournament, but I want to withhold my consumption and invite others to do so as well. My best friend is Spanish, and I have various friends and family throughout Latin America, so have decided to only watch games in which Brazil, Ecuador, Argentina and Spain play. That may not sound like a significant boycott but, as someone who breathes football, it will be quite a big challenge.\nI feel less excited. It\u2019s hard to support a sporting event that has directly caused so much death. As the son of a brown Peruvian immigrant, I feel responsible for doing my part to lift up migrant justice. Though, I\u2019m also aware that I haven\u2019t thought to boycott previous World Cups; there is potentially some pontificating and hypocrisy there. I don\u2019t judge people who are not boycotting. I do think it would be beautiful to put enough pressure on Fifa to move them to compensate the bereaved families. Alfonso Sasieta, a Peru fan in the US\nThanks to everyone who took part. We had hundreds of responses and would have published many more but simply ran out of space. Thank you."

                    "body": "The reactions of John Kear and his players at full time told the story. Make no mistake about it, neither Wales nor the Cook Islands will be lifting the Rugby League World Cup trophy aloft next month but, as the Cook Islands coach Kevin Iro said, World Cup wins do not come easy. How both nations know that all too well. The Cook Islands did not even qualify for the last World Cup in 2017, and Wales haven\u2019t won a game at the tournament since 2000. Welsh supporters would have hoped at various points here that their wait was about to come to an end, but despite a spirited effort, they fell agonisingly short.  Leading 12-6 at half-time, it certainly seemed possible that the band of brothers Kear has assembled for this tournament were capable of springing a surprise. Their headline players have either converted to other nations, retired or, in the case of rugby union-bound Regan Grace, switched codes, leaving Kear with little in the way of top-level experience to select from. Just two of his 24-man squad are from Super League, with the rest part-time players from the lower leagues of England and Australia. Their prop, Dan Fleming, runs a cake shop in Halifax by day. Their captain, Elliot Kear, is a firefighter. They were desperately close to a first World Cup win in 22 years here, but ultimately it was the Cook Islands who kept their hopes of qualifying from Group D alive with victory. \u201cI\u2019m immensely proud, the effort was absolutely superb,\u201d Kear said afterwards. \u201cThere were some superb individual performances but it was a collective display. It\u2019s difficult to sum up, as there\u2019s a lot of emotion, but we were right in there until the end.\u201d Tries from Rhodri Lloyd and Ollie Olds gave the Welsh a deserved lead at half-time, with the Cook Islands\u2019 response coming from Anthony Gelling. The Cook Islands may have a population of only 16,000 but they have much more top-level talent than Wales, aided by players born in Australia and New Zealand who qualify through family heritage. That includes the likes of Esan Marsters, who will play for Huddersfield next year, and Davvy Moale, the South Sydney prop whose barnstorming try midway through the second half helped put the Cook Islands ahead. Wales fought commendably all evening but as that second half wore on, you feared that fatigue would set in among their predominantly part-time squad. Moale\u2019s try, as he crashed through four Welsh defenders, underlined that, and when Steven Marsters collected a Brad Takairangi kick four minutes later, the writing felt like it was on the wall for Wales. But they battled until the very end. Even in the dying seconds, they had an opportunity to score the try that would have levelled the game, but the Cook Islands held on. The manner in which the Welsh players slumped to the turf suggested they knew the World Cup victory which has escaped them for 22 years had slipped through their grasp again. Twelve of Kear\u2019s 24-man squad were born in Wales, something he believes will yield a long-term gain for the nation. There may have been short-term pain here, with more to come ahead of tougher group games against Tonga and Papua New Guinea but they could certainly leave Leigh with their heads held high."

                    "body": "Towards the end of Gareth Southgate\u2019s post-match press conference, deep in the harshly lit fibreglass bunker that is the Al Bayt Stadium media suite, England\u2019s manager was asked by an Argentinian journalist for his thoughts on the prospect down the track of having to face Lionel Messi. \u201cWell,\u201d Southgate frowned, making a show of giving the question all due consideration. \u201cHe\u2019s a good player.\u201d As super-dry wee\u2011hours press room one\u2011liners go, it was pretty good.\nAfter that Southgate just kind of shrugged and said something like, yeah, he\u2019s a genius but we\u2019ll worry about that if it happens. England have to play France first in the quarter-final on Saturday. Their only chance of facing Messi at Qatar 2022 would be to reach the final, less than two weeks and three possible games from now.\nProgress has been tidy so far against opponents that have ranged from not very good, to quite good, to really not very good at all, to Senegal\u2019s decent-ish. But the weather is now shifting. France await. And things are about to get real.\n\nBefore then Southgate has a moment to feel some due satisfaction at England reaching their par level at this World Cup. However this ends now there will be no disaster, no humiliation, no shrieking and wailing from the chorus at England\u2019s back (NB there will of course be shrieking and wailing, because there must be, but only from the most entrenched, the fringe elements, broadsheet football writers and other extremist elements).\nThe reality is England have now hit their level. If it is acceptable to compare this World Cup to the Premier League \u2013 and we may as well, because that seemed to be happening until a few moments ago \u2013 then England are the Tottenham Hotspur of Qatar 2022 (fourth place last year, Kane+, not won anything for decades).\n\nBeating a depleted Senegal was like Spurs beating Wolves. Good but you kind of expected it. The USA were Brighton, spiky, difficult, an acceptable 0-0. Wales were Southampton. Iran were Norwich.\nEngland/Spurs have done a good but unremarkable job of getting past these teams. But now Super Saturday is starting to loom. Spurs will now play Liverpool, supercharged but mildly flawed opponents; a game they aren\u2019t expected to win, but which will still carry a skein of hope. \nThis is a good spot to be in; but also a tactically troubling prospect given the evidence of England\u2019s and France\u2019s four games apiece so far.\nSouthgate was also asked the more relevant question of how England are going to cope with Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 operating in a perfect moment of Mbapp\u00e9\u2011ness, an issue he dodged by talking instead about how good Antoine Griezmann is. But something will surely have to change before Saturday\u2019s game back at Al Bayt if England hope to move beyond steady and commendable progress.\nFirst, the good news. England came into this World Cup finals tournament in bit of mess, besieged by goldfish\u2011memory critics, and facing a group where, somehow \u2013 it remains a mystery \u2013 every opponent was ranked in the world\u2019s top 20.\n\nChuck in Sunday night\u2019s date with the (depleted) African champions and England have played four, won three, scored 12 and conceded only twice, in the messy endgame with Iran. The midfield looks fluid and has begun to score goals. The starting front six against Senegal featured four players aged 23 and under.\nLooking back further England have clean sheets in nine of their past 11 tournament games, with eight wins and three draws. Harry Kane has also scored, which will ease his hidden but tangible frustrations, those moments in the second half where Kane comes to resemble some sad, noble, cat-rescuing 1950s milkman, unthanked but doggedly dutiful. He will be settled now. And he likes these games.\nOn the other hand there are also some obvious flaws, weaknesses that all four opponents to date have picked at, and which France may just rip open.\nSenegal looked as if they were targeting Harry Maguire in the early moments, isolating him, pressing high, finding moments where the speed of their front three could prey on his glacial turning circle.\nThere were also three occasions where Maguire chugged forward with the ball, a kind of steamship Beckenbauer, then gave it away. At least one should have ended in a goal for Senegal. Southgate has talked up Maguire\u2019s ability to carry the ball forward. Perhaps Maguire now feels this is part of his locus standi for keeping a spot in the team.\nAgainst the USA he kept launching showy artillery passes, and at one point veered out to the left wing like a broken dodgem. This feels like a player trying to fit an abstract idea of himself, one fraught with danger. Here is England\u2019s least mobile player effectively choosing to move himself miles out of position. Ousmane Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 and Mbapp\u00e9 will feast on those spaces if Maguire tries this, offering up their own bespoke VIP lane to England\u2019s goal.\n\nThe other problem in defence may heal itself with a few more days. Kyle Walker did not look fit against Senegal. There is an idea out there that England have a player capable of matching Mbapp\u00e9\u2019s foot speed on the same flank. Not on this evidence.\nIt seems likely the moments of vulnerability in all four games to date will encourage Southgate to switch to his comfort-blanket back three. This will probably become the battlefield of the upcoming days, and the stick with which to beat England if they lose, as they probably should four times out of five, whatever the formation.\nThe back three is still an understandable choice given the defenders Southgate has. Maguire needs cover. Walker as the right-sided centre-back and Kieran Trippier outside him is a way of not losing the game in the opening half-hour.\nOn the other hand even those who value the results of Southgate\u2019s caution may feel tempted now by the success of the current midfield three, with its fine balance of strengths. It would be fascinating to see Rice-Bellingham-Henderson/Phillips tested against the world champions, if a little hair-raising if Maguire starts in a four, and seriously undermined if he drops deep in fear of France\u2019s pace, as has happened at Manchester United.\nSouthgate will run these permutations, will make the call based on seeing his players up close, and on proper study of England\u2019s opponents. It is probably time simply to trust him.\nAnd here is another thing: England have only once in their entire World Cup history won a knockout game against a team that had previously won the tournament. That was the 1966 final. England tend to win the games they should win, then lose to better teams: Portugal, Germany, West Germany, Brazil, Uruguay (as world champions). It is a surprisingly prosaic reality for a nation that considers itself, against the facts, to be a poetically stricken underachiever.\nWith any real perspective France should basically be a free hit from this point. But then, in many ways it doesn\u2019t really matter what England do now, or how they do it. We are witnessing a kind of endgame, six years into this thing, the dots being joined, the pieces aligned. We have watched this process in action, have taken our positions. Whatever your view on Southgate (despoiler of talent, or pleasant and successful manager) it is unlikely to change. Time, now, just to watch it play out."

The move has cemented Moulding\u2019s control of THG, formerly known as The Hut Group, which owns a range of internet health and beauty retailers, and ended speculation about SoftBank\u2019s disastrous investment. The Japanese firm, run by its founder, Masayoshi Son, is offloading its stake \u2013 once worth \u00a3500m \u2013 for \u00a331m, making a loss of \u00a3450m on its investment. It bought an 8% stake in THG for \u00a3481m in May 2021 to help fund expansion of its technology platform a few months before it floated in London.  THG shares rose 10% in early trading and later traded 9% higher at 49.9p. However, shares have plummeted 86% over the past year, as the business struggled with slowing sales. THG owns the retail websites Lookfantastic, Glossybox, Zavvi and Coggles, as well as beauty brands including ESPA and Illamasqua, and the sports nutrition brand Myprotein. It was founded in 2004 by Moulding and John Gallemore, who started out selling CDs and DVDs online for other retailers. SoftBank\u2019s disposal comes as it decided to liquidate its internal hedge fund SB Northstar, which has racked up losses of about $6bn (\u00a35bn). THG said SB Northstar had agreed to sell 80.6m THG shares, its entire shareholding, to Qatar Investment Authority and Moulding, THG\u2019s chief executive. The shares will be sold at 39p each on Thursday, below Monday\u2019s closing price of 45p. QIA, which is already a shareholder, will buy 84% of the shares. SoftBank terminated an agreement in July that would have allowed it to acquire a fifth of THG\u2019s Ingenuity technology division. In a stock market update, Moulding said: \u201cWe at THG extend our thanks to SoftBank for their support as a financial and commercial partner, and we will continue to benefit from the relationships formed across their international technology portfolio. \u201cI\u2019m delighted to be further increasing my family\u2019s stake in THG, continuing our unswerving support following on from other recent share purchases.\u201d"

                    "body": "The game England did not want has led to the outcome they most feared: another freak injury and another key player out of the T20 World Cup. Scans have shown that Reece Topley\u2019s trip over the advertising cushions at the Gabba in Brisbane during fielding practice before Monday\u2019s warm-up against Pakistan has led to two ruptured ligaments in his left ankle, and he will fly home before England\u2019s tournament has even begun. Tymal Mills \u2013 one of three travelling reserves, and the player Topley replaced in the 2021 World Cup squad midway through the tournament when Mills sustained a thigh injury \u2013 has been drafted into the squad as a replacement. Lancashire\u2019s Luke Wood, who made his England debut in the recent tour of Pakistan, will now travel to Australia to join the group as a reserve, and is expected to meet them in Melbourne at the start of next week.  Topley\u2019s injury follows that of Jonny Bairstow, who broke his left leg in three places and dislocated an ankle after slipping during a round of golf last month. After an overwhelmingly positive buildup to the tournament Jos Buttler and Matthew Mott must now redraft their XI for Saturday\u2019s opening game against Afghanistan in Perth. Monday\u2019s game featured another slip that would have caused concern among England\u2019s coaching staff, as Liam Livingstone \u2013 making his return from an ankle injury of his own \u2013 fell while turning for a second run, and stayed on the ground for a few seconds before rising gingerly to his feet. But not only did he continue to play, he said later that this moment came as a significant morale-boost. \u201cIt was actually nice to slip because it gives you a little bit of confidence,\u201d he said. \u201cConsidering I had a 12-week injury and we\u2019re just at the end of week seven I\u2019m pretty happy with where I\u2019m at, and we\u2019ve still got another few days before the first game. I didn\u2019t want to go hell for leather, I just wanted to make sure I got back to cricket and got through my bowling. The turning and stuff was going to be difficult, so to have a slip on it and to feel all right is a bit of a confidence-booster.\u201d  Livingstone has had his ankle tightly swaddled in bandages for every flight \u2013 and there have been several, with England\u2019s visit to Australia starting on the west coast, moving to Canberra and then Brisbane in the east and returning to Perth in the west, all within the first fortnight. \u201cFlying hasn\u2019t been the easiest,\u201d he said. \u201cI have to compress it every time I fly. It\u2019s just been a bit niggly and I\u2019ve done everything I can to make sure I\u2019m fit and available for Saturday. I played at 90% on Monday, which is what we\u2019re after.\u201d Despite not giving his maximum Livingstone did manage to hit one monstrous six, which landed on the roof of the Gabba before rolling out of the stadium. \u201cHarry Brook was actually taking the mick out of me, saying this was a stadium I hadn\u2019t cleared, and I said if ever there was a chance to do it, it was on that wicket,\u201d Livingstone said. \u201cSo it was nice to be batting with Brooky at the time. It\u2019s nice to get a few out of the middle to get going. I\u2019ve still got some work to do batting-wise but I\u2019m pretty close to where I want to be.\u201d"

At least the struggles were educational. \u201cThings became pretty clear,\u201d he said, without elaborating.\nThe zestless efforts weren\u2019t aberrations. The US generally struggle to score away from home and often look ordinary against opponents outside the mediocre Concacaf region. There\u2019s an abundance of wingers and the midfield is busy and bright, but the centre-back and centre-forward positions are problematic and frequent injuries have prevented Berhalter from playing his best XI.\n\nNor is it clear that the US are good enough on the ball to outplay the world\u2019s best teams, and there\u2019s little evidence they can adjust if exuberance does not carry the day. So wedded to youth and athleticism is Berhalter that there is a real lack of World Cup experience in the squad, although that is partly down to the fact the US missed out in 2018.\nWith so many untested players \u2013 not to mention the coach \u2013 it is hard to predict whether they will rise to the occasion, be cowed by it, or perform more or less in line with their talent level \u2013 which would mean that with a good start against Wales they could qualify from the group, probably in second place, then be outclassed by the first major nation they face in the knockout round.\n\nThe coach\nAfter a 14-month search for a successor to Bruce Arena, Gregg Berhalter was appointed in December 2018 after spells in charge of Swedish club Hammarby and MLS side Columbus Crew. This worried fans who wanted a head coach with a more distinguished pedigree and many are still to be convinced of his merits \u2013 but the thoughtful and thorough 49-year-old New Jersey native has won 36 and lost only 10 of his 56 games in charge. Berhalter\u2019s playing career as a defender included a season at Crystal Palace and 44 international caps. He made two appearances at the 2002 World Cup when the US reached the quarter-finals, and was an unused squad member in 2006.\nStar player\nChristian Pulisic will cut in from the left wing and much responsibility rests on the captain\u2019s shoulders, especially since the US don\u2019t have a top-quality central striker. At 24 the Chelsea forward is not the same fearless, rampaging kid who emerged during the failed 2018 qualifying campaign. For his country he now tends to drop into midfield in search of the ball. That\u2019s the weight of expectation (and injuries) for you. There\u2019s even a car advert in which he reclines on a therapist\u2019s couch and runs into a wardrobe to escape the media.\n\nUnsung hero\nIn 2021 Yunus Musah chose to represent the US rather than England, Italy or Ghana, and the calibre of his suitors is evidence of his ability. Blossoming at Valencia, he\u2019s an energetic midfield disruptor who is calm under pressure with the ball at his feet. If he can add goals and assists the 19-year-old is a potential superstar, though that may not be obvious if he plays in a deeper-lying role to liberate Weston McKennie and act as a bulwark against superior opponents.\nProbable lineup\n\nQatar stance\nUS Soccer has briefed the players on the issues arising from staging the tournament in Qatar. Given the squad\u2019s adoption of the slogan \u201cBe The Change\u201d after the killing of George Floyd and previous outspoken positions on stronger gun laws and social justice \u2013 each team member wore a jacket with a personal message before a game against Wales in 2020 \u2013 it would not be surprising if some players speak out and/or make symbolic gestures in support of LGBTQ+ and migrant workers\u2019 rights. US Soccer also plan to encourage the display of rainbow flags and has been checking that the businesses it is working with in Qatar during the tournament \u2013 such as the team hotel \u2013 respect workers\u2019 rights laws.\nNational anthem\nThere\u2019s a bit of previous here to add spice to the US-England group game. Sung to the tune of an 18th-century English drinking ditty, The Star-Spangled Banner became the national anthem in 1931. The words of this stirring ode to freedom were written by Francis Scott Key, a slaveholding 35-year-old lawyer, following an American victory over the invading Royal Navy in the Battle of Baltimore in 1814, soon after the British had torched the White House.\nAll-time cult hero\nA US national team stalwart, bearded musician and export to Europe turned TV pundit who\u2019s not Alexi Lalas? That would be Clint Dempsey, AKA Deuce, who released a rap song, Don\u2019t Tread, ahead of the 2006 World Cup. Was it a banger? Sort of. \u201cBest to give way for the USA / Now we\u2019re hot / You might think we\u2019re a sun ray.\u201d The artful Texan forward and inducer of Robert Green\u2019s nightmares scored in three World Cups, thrived in England with Fulham and Tottenham then signed for Seattle in 2013, declaring: \u201cI just want to score goals and go fishing.\u201d He retired in 2018 with a joint-USMNT record 57 goals from 141 caps and, like Lalas, will work for American TV at Qatar 2022.\nTom Dart is a freelancer who writes for the Guardian US among others.

                    "body": "Moeen Ali has admitted England have not played well at the T20 World Cup and challenged the team to establish themselves as a genuinely great white-ball side by adding another trophy to the 50-over World Cup they won at home in 2019. England also reached the final of the 2016 T20 World Cup and the semi-finals of last year\u2019s competition, but Moeen does not believe their previous success is enough for them to be considered a top-level team. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of talk about us being a great white-ball side and the England team has been really good, but we\u2019ve only won one tournament and it\u2019s important we start winning more as a team and as a country,\u201d he said. \u201cThen we can really call ourselves a top side. We are a really good side. I get that, and we have been over a long period, but if we\u2019re going to be a great side we need to win more trophies, and when I look back I want to say: \u2018Yes, I was part of a great side.\u2019\u201d  England have not often looked like that in this tournament so far, having progressed through the Super 12s by beating New Zealand and squeaking past Afghanistan and Sri Lanka after nervous run chases, and despite losing to Ireland. On Thursday they face India in the semi-finals, aware that a significant improvement will be required if they are to reach another final. \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019ve played well in the whole tournament,\u201d Moeen said. \u201cBut we got the job done. We wanted to get to the semis. In the past we\u2019ve played well and got through. This time I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve played well but we\u2019ve got through and the best is yet to come with this side. I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve been near where we want to be, but now\u2019s a great opportunity to put that right. You always talk about peaking at the right time and if you just about scrape through it means you can get better. If we play our best cricket in the next two games I believe we win the World Cup.\u201d England are very likely to be forced to change their starting XI for the semi-final, with Dawid Malan having suffered a groin strain against Sri Lanka on Saturday. Team doctors have decided that he does not require a scan but, while he continues to receive treatment, Moeen admitted: \u201cIt doesn\u2019t look great.\u201d Early indications are that Phil Salt will come in as a direct replacement, though different options are being discussed. \u201cMala\u2019s obviously a big miss because he\u2019s a brilliant player in T20 cricket and he has been over a long period of time,\u201d Moeen said. \u201cThe great thing with this side is there\u2019s so many options. You can put Ben Stokes at three, you can put Phil Salt at three, myself or whoever, there\u2019s so many options.\u201d Stokes\u2019s innings against Sri Lanka, when he kept his head while all around him were losing their wickets, guiding the team calmly to victory, has confirmed his importance to the side, having previously struggled to make an impact with the bat in Australia. \u201cWe should [all] have played like Stokesy, just get the job done,\u201d Moeen said. \u201cBe ugly and don\u2019t worry what it looks like. \u201cWe didn\u2019t know what we should have done as batters \u2013 it was the pressure of the situation, but that\u2019s when you need someone like Stokesy. We need him because he can win you a game like that. He\u2019s calm, he\u2019s been there before and he\u2019s done it \u2013 as long as he was there everybody was fine.\u201d India will represent a much greater challenge. Virat Kohli is the tournament\u2019s leading run-scorer with 246 \u2013 almost double England\u2019s best, Alex Hales\u2019s 125 \u2013 while Suryakumar Yadav is not far behind with 225, scored at the ludicrous strike rate of 193.96.  The 32-year-old Yadav\u2019s 25-ball 61 against Zimbabwe in their final game of the Super 12s was jaw-dropping at times. \u201cHe\u2019s an amazing player,\u201d Moeen said. \u201cI do feel like he\u2019s the best in the world, and he\u2019s one of many good players they have. He\u2019s probably taken T20 cricket to another level \u2013 he\u2019s the first player to come through where you can\u2019t bowl at him when he\u2019s playing well.\u201d Moeen may be able to help England come up with a plan for Kohli, having played with him for Royal Challengers Bangalore in the Indian Premier League and bowled him while playing for Chennai Super Kings this year. \u201cI\u2019ve played against these guys quite a lot now so you know a lot,\u201d he said. \u201cAs a team we prepare for everything the day will bring. We\u2019ll know how we\u2019re going to bowl at him, but if we have to change and adapt we\u2019ve got the players to do it. That for me is really important.\u201d"

                    "body": "Australia overcame an early scare to run away with their first game of the Rugby League World Cup, Storm playmakers Harry Grant and Cameron Munster leading the way, as they defeated a brave but ill-disciplined Fiji 42-8 in an eight-try feast before a crowd of 13,366 at Headingley Stadium in Leeds. After 1078 days since their last Test, the Kangaroos were shellshocked early when, from Fiji\u2019s first set in possession, the men in white touched down, a deliciously curling grubber from Siti Moceidreke curving back to meet Semi Valemei in the left corner. It was a heartening start for the Fijian Bati that must have cheered coach Joe Rabele who had been rushed to hospital with illness before the kickoff.  The sucker-punch start made Australia lost shape. Fiji had made the most of their one minute in attack, while Australia failed to convert from 14 minutes with the ball. But after some strong Jake Trbojevic charges, Cameron Murray and Daly Cherry-Evans combined, pivoting at pace as they sank into the line. It created the reverse angle for Jeremiah Nanai, slicing back inside to go in under the posts in the 15th minute. Australia settled and a Munster one-on-one steal set up Nanai for another charge, but this time the big man went just short. Fiji made big metres on their return set and were setting up for a second five-pointer until Kangaroos captain James Tedesco diffused the last-tackle bomb and Hunt shovelled a nondescript pass off the ruck. But the men it found are anything but nondescript. Instead of running off the line Latrell Mitchell quickly flipped it on to Josh Addo-Carr. Cruelly shunned by NSW coach Brad Fittler for State of Origin but prized in Mal Meninga\u2019s national set-up, The Foxx put on the after after-burners to escape rush hour and go coast-to-coast, scything through Fiji\u2019s back three with speed and guile to put the Kangaroos clear at 10-4. Nearing the half-hour mark Fiji\u2019s big defenders were tiring and Meninga brought on Reuben Cotter to exploit it. But it was Fiji who found the wind. Api Koroisau\u2019s stabbed kick on the line was too fast for the chasers. Australia rumbled downfield and after Munster fumbled Hunt\u2019s bomb, they tried again. This time Angus Crichton got on the left shoulder of Munster at pace and reached out for his first try in green and gold. Before the break, Kangaroos centre Mitchell looked to have scored a final try, stomping over from a metre out, but Crichton was harshly adjudged to have knocked on in the play the ball. It left the score at 18-4 at halftime, as the slick track at Leeds loosened the paint on the field and left the players walking off smeared in white. Crichton definitely erred straight after the break, a sloppy play-the-ball giving Fiji what they needed: the opportunity to score first. They fumbled that first chance but Australia made the most of theirs, Addo-Carr exploiting a sliver space on the left, then offloading to Munster who stayed alive until Mitchell loomed and cantered away. Clear on the scoreboard, Australia now unfurled a few trick shots. Most of them flopped but were fun to watch. It took Harry Grant to reassert the Kangaroo\u2019s class. In the 52nd minute, the little pivot barrelled a sublime 40-20 down the line to set up in the corner and then, icing what he started, scooted over untouched from the next set. Captain James Tedesco then jinked infield and through on the hour mark. The collisions had been massive between both teams all night but Cotter mistimed his run from the restart and the ensuing head clash with Tui Kamikamica had both seeing stars and heading for the sheds. Fiji were also left reeled shortly afterward when a Grant kick punctured a tired defence to gift a second try for Addo-Carr. Valentine Holmes hadn\u2019t missed all night and he skirted the inside post to make it 42-4. Fiji got a late consolation try, a neat grubber and patient touchdown for Turuva making it 42-8. But a rollercoaster game, riven with errors, but bejewelled with sensational tries had eventually run its natural course with a dominant display by Australia sounding a warning shot to all. Not that the St James Park PA would\u2019ve picked it up, the system fizzling one set in to the Kaiser Chiefs\u2019 curtain raising set. Fiji showed both skill and mettle to banish their 50-0 trouncing by England in the warmups and show they can be a force in future games. Australia will be pleased with a tough hit-out that shucked the rust, slicked the combinations and got them rolling toward a title defence. They will likely bring in Nathan Cleary at playmaker, shifting Cherry-Evans to hooker, and that will turbocharge the Kangaroos\u2019 potency further. \u201cI\u2019m happy with that,\u201d Australia\u2019s coach Mal Meninga surmised afterward. \u201cWe got through it pretty well. Really happy with the defence. A few things to fix up with the ball, but overall, very happy. \u201cWe\u2019ve got some competition in the team,\u201d Meninga added of the likely Cleary inclusion, amongst others, for the Kangaroo\u2019s next game against Scotland next Saturday. \u201cWe\u2019ll rest a few guys next week and play some others who can put their foot forward. We talked about how it would be clunky from our point of view. We\u2019ve only been here for a week. We\u2019ll improve as the tournament goes on.\u201d"

                    "body": "When England exited Euro 2016 via an ignominious defeat to Iceland, Wales took great delight in their misery, celebrating at their hotel base in Dinard. A video of the Wales squad jumping for joy and huddling together as England\u2019s players fell to the floor like dominoes went viral. England\u2019s relegation from the Nations League is incomparable and neither were Wales, 67 days out from when they collide in their final Group B match at the Ahmad bin Ali Stadium, ever going to contemplate a repeat of those scenes, which, it is fair to say, received mixed reviews.  It is five long games without a win for England and four for Wales but the latter undeniably find themselves in a good spot before hosting Poland on Sunday, encouraged by a strong second-half performance in Thursday\u2019s defeat to Belgium, No 2 in the Fifa rankings. Then there is the small matter of a trip to Qatar and a first World Cup in 64 years on the horizon. Wales\u2019 first Group B opponent, the USA, have also not convinced of late and slipped to defeat to Japan on Friday but Gareth Bale is not reading too much into their rivals\u2019 recent hiccups. \u201cPeople will up their games, players might not be playing well but in two months\u2019 time they\u2019ll be playing better,\u201d Bale, the Wales captain, says. Rob Page, the Wales manager, watched England\u2019s defeat to Italy with his staff in Cardiff and is flying to Spain next week to watch USA take on Saudi Arabia in their final warm-up match. Ultimately, however, he knows Wales have to get their own house in order. \u201cI\u2019m surprised in how the group has panned out,\u201d Page says of England, who entertain Germany at Wembley on Monday. \u201cThey were up against a very good Italian team who could have scored a couple of more goals. You\u2019re always surprised when England don\u2019t do so well because of the expectations they have put on themselves over the years but that\u2019s for them to worry about and deal with now.  \u201cWe\u2019ve got a job in hand that we\u2019re fully focused on. As soon as the final whistle has gone we\u2019ll be preparing for the World Cup.\u201d Page will be forced into at least two changes for Poland\u2019s visit, with Ethan Ampadu and Chris Mepham both suspended, while Bale is likely to return to the starting lineup. Page insists there will be no surprises when the teams are read aloud an hour before kick-off at the Cardiff City Stadium. Bale is yet to complete 90 minutes since joining Los Angeles FC in the summer but feels he is slowly edging towards peak condition. \u201cI am closer than I have been in the last few years, for sure,\u201d Bale says. \u201cIt\u2019s about playing minutes and games and I\u2019m starting to do that a lot more often now. \u201cThe more I play, the fitter I\u2019ll get. Hopefully, I can start to peak and get stronger and stronger as quickly as possible.\u201d Bale\u2019s condition has been aided by regular dialogue between LAFC and the Football Association of Wales\u2019 medical team. The Wales physio, Sean Connelly, was invited to Los Angeles within a week of Bale moving stateside. \u201cThey have a great relationship and they\u2019ve both reached out to each other to make sure communication is good and what I\u2019m doing are the correct things and not things I shouldn\u2019t be doing,\u201d Bale says. \u201cThe FAW have always done what\u2019s best for me and what I need so I suppose it\u2019s a good thing they\u2019ve got a great relationship already.\u201d Wales are bottom of Nations League Group 4 League A and must beat Poland to stay in the top tier. The obvious caveat to their position is that they were playing with one hand tied behind their back in June because what proved to be a historic World Cup playoff win over Ukraine understandably took precedence. That Wales were so disappointed with a slender defeat in Brussels shows the confidence in the camp. \u201cWe are playing against big teams every week now and we\u2019re always competing with them,\u201d Bale says. \u201cWe\u2019re always in the games and that can only be a testament to us. We\u2019re definitely on the right trajectory, we\u2019re definitely improving and that is the direction we want to continue to go in.\u201d"

The prelude was full of permutations and calculations, but when David Warner began in top gear everything seemed straightforward.  But sport fascinates us endlessly for its ability to surprise, and as Australia lost wickets at regular intervals and Afghanistan\u2019s seamers delivered perfect yorkers and unpickable slower balls the night\u2019s narrative swung wildly.  Glenn Maxwell ensured Australia retained the upper hand at the break, but the resounding triumph they required to heap pressure on England looked out of reach. Victory of any sort seemed at risk with Afghanistan at 99-2 but that man Maxwell wasn\u2019t finished and his direct hit from long-off changed the night in an instant. Afghanistan went from trading blows with the champs to collapsing on the ropes, staggering to 103-6 in no time. But still the night wasn\u2019t through. Australia not only failed to mop up the tail and sneak a net run rate boost, they found Rashid Khan in an impish mood and the legspinning allrounder unfurled all manner of improbable strokes to clatter Afghanistan to within two balls of victory.  Now it\u2019s over to England and Sri Lanka in Sydney to determine whether any of it mattered.  Thanks for joining me tonight. Stay tuned for plenty more from this enthralling competition.      11.58am    Adam Zampa\u2019s had a word with Australian TV.  We haven\u2019t played our best cricket and we deserve to be in the position we are in at the moment. We probably expected the net-run rate to come into the game if we got a score of 200 plus. Wadey said before we get out there let\u2019s go for the win and if we knock a few over we can think about a net run rate. We were a little surprised about the conditions. The wicket was slow in the day, then when the lights came and the dew came down it got better. We didn\u2019t play our best cricket. Missed a few opportunities with the bat to get a big score. I know there was a period there where it looked like they were on top, we dragged it back and Rash nearly got them home. A good game of cricket.      11.53am    Here\u2019s how the Group 1 table looks with one match remaining. That match is England v Sri Lanka at 7pm local time in Sydney. England fans will be pleased to know the forecast is good.       11.46am   Glenn Maxwell Player of the Match  The most important batter on the night and the most decisive figure in the field with his brilliant run out.      11.43am    Afghanistan depart the T20 World Cup the only nation not to win a match in the Super 12s, but they proved their value to world cricket tonight with an entertaining performance full of courage. If either or both of Gurbaz and Gulbadin had gone on to make a big score they may have got over the line. But then if that was the case maybe Rashid\u2019s wild 48 from 23 doesn\u2019t happen?      11.40am    What does that all mean for Group 1?  New Zealand are through to the semi-finals Sri Lanka, Ireland, and Afghanistan are eliminated England will join New Zealand in the semis if they beat Sri Lanka in Sydney tomorrow. If they fail, Australia qualify We can all forget about net run rate for a while      11.37am    Australia prevail, just, and despite another below-par showing they are still in the running for the semi-finals.      11.36am   Australia win by 4 runs  20th over: Afghanistan 164-7 (Rashid 48, Mujeeb 0) Rashid finishes with a flourish, pulling for a one-bounce four. Such a valiant effort at the death.  Updated at 11.37am GMT    11.34am    19.5 over: Rashid goes big but can only sky an edge that lands safely. They earn two. 9 off one required.      11.34am    19.4 over: SIX! Stoinis drops short and Rashid larrups the ball into the cheap seats.  11 off two required.     11.33am    19.3 over: Decent connection but straight to long on. Rashid rejects the single.     11.32am    19.2 over Stoinis leaks onto Rashid\u2019s pads and the batter flicks the ball over short fine leg for four! 17 off four.     11.32am    19.1 over: Rashid swings bit doesn\u2019t connect, declining the single to retain strike.      11.31am   WICKET! Darwish run out (Stoinis) 15 (Afghanistan 148-7)  19.0 over: Stoinis begins with a leg-side wide. Rashid scampers through to pinch the strike, Wade throws, misses, Stoinis gathers then throws down the non-striker\u2019s end.     11.29am    19th over: Afghanistan 147-6 (Darwish 15, Rashid 32) Wade throws the ball to Hazlewood, and he begins with a dot that flirts with a wide outside off stump, then a perfect straight yorker. Another wide dot has Rashid swinging himself off his feet but then he connects! It\u2019s not pretty, but it\u2019s SIX over midwicket to Rashid nonetheless. Can the momentum build? No; swing and a miss. But Rashid doesn\u2019t take a backward step and he slaps a four straight back over the bowler\u2019s head to close the over. 22 required from the final over.  Updated at 11.29am GMT    11.25am    18th over: Afghanistan 136-6 (Darwish 14, Rashid 24) More streaky swiping from Afghanistan\u2019s lower order as the energy ebbs out of the contest. Until Rashid Khan goes SIX SIX that is. The first is blur of wrists that sends Richardson over square leg, then he leans back and spanks a biggie over long off.  33 off 12. They can\u2019t, can they?      11.20am    17th over: Afghanistan 120-6 (Darwish 12, Rashid 8) Afghanistan keep swinging but only one delivery from Cummins\u2019s over reaches the boundary.       11.15am    16th over: Afghanistan 112-6 (Darwish 5, Rashid 7) Rashid has tried to smash everything sent his way towards the James Webb telescope, but most of his swipes have resulted only in miscued edges. Richardson with a stock over. Australia grinding their way towards victory.   Updated at 11.17am GMT    11.12am    15th over: Afghanistan 106-6 (Darwish 3, Rashid 3) From 99-2 and in the mix for an almighty upset to 106-6. Cricket, eh?     11.08am   WICKET! Nabi c Warner b Hazlewood 1 (Afghanistan 103-6)  Hazlewood returns as Australia look to polish things up quick-smart, and he strikes with his third delivery! That said, Nabi did all the hard work, shovelling an ugly bunt straight to Warner coming in from the midwicket fence. This is an abject collapse.      11.05am    14th over: Afghanistan 101-5 (Nabi 0, Darwish 2) Well, that was the over that decides the result of this contest. Three wickets and Afghanistan have imploded in spectacular fashion. Well bowled Adam Zampa. Well fielded Glenn Maxwell.      11.04am   WICKET! Najib c Maxwell b Zampa 0 (Afghanistan 99-5)  Oh Afghanistan, what are you doing!!?? Najib tries to send the second delivery of his knock over long-off and sticks a sitter down Maxwell\u2019s throat.      11.02am   WICKET! Ibrahim c Marsh b Zampa 0 (Afghanistan 99-4)  Two in two for Australia! Both set batsmen are gone in the blink of an eye. Ibrahim tried to sweep but could only top edge an easy lobbed catch to Marsh on the 45.     11.00am   WICKET! Gulbadin run out (Maxwell) 39 (Afghanistan 99-3)  MAXWELLBALL!  Delight for Australia. Disaster for Afghanistan. Ibrahim drove Zampa to long off and after completing an easy single Gulbadin pushed for two but Maxwell\u2019s mighty arm threw down the stumps from near the rope.      10.58am    13th over: Afghanistan 98-2 (Ibrahim 25, Gulbadin 39) Wade turns to Cummins to make something happen and he almost does \u2013 twice - but chances to long-on and point both arrive on the half-volley. Nonetheless, Cummins\u2019s pace and control exposes Ibrahim\u2019s limitations with the Afghanistan No 3 unable to get much bat on anything sent his way, full or short.  Ibrahim needs to focus on strike rotation not slogging the best Test bowler in the game.      10.54am    12th over: Afghanistan 96-2 (Ibrahim 24, Gulbadin 38) Richardson replaces Green but Gulbadin sends him the journey, picking up a length delivery and carting it just wide of the diving long-on. Then he stands his ground and edges through the vacant cordon to third for four. Now Ibrahim wants a piece of the action, stepping to leg and smiting Richardson in-to-out with precision over extra cover for four. Brilliant over from Afghanistan that has ignited this run-chase. Pretty sure we can put calculators to bed now. Net run rate is no longer on the table.     10.47am    11th over: Afghanistan 79-2 (Ibrahim 19, Gulbadin 27) Zampa continues after drinks. Afghanistan pick up seven easy runs with chanceless batting and hard running.      10.43am    At the halfway mark of the run-chase things are not working out how Australia would have hoped. The massive victory to put pressure on England tomorrow now seems a long shot, and Afghanistan are still in with a shout tonight.      10.41am    10th over: Afghanistan 72-2 (Ibrahim 15, Gulbadin 24) Green\u2019s extra bounce imparts a ball shaped mark on Gulbadin\u2019s inner thigh. Stung, the batter clears his front leg and slaps a tracer bullet of a six over cow corner. Now it\u2019s Ibrahim\u2019s turn to make attack the best form of defence, stepping to leg and getting a thin edge to an ugly mow that just evades Zampa at third.      10.36am    9th over: Afghanistan 60-2 (Ibrahim 10, Gulbadin 17) Ibrahim gets moving again with an inside-edge for three off Zampa, a stroke that brings Gulbadin on strike and allows him to reach out and smoke a powerful cover drive for four.      10.33am    8th over: Afghanistan 51-2 (Ibrahim 7, Gulbadin 11) Time for a fifth Australian right-arm over paceman in the form of Cameron Green, and the young allrounder begins well, conceding just one run. Gulbadin is responsible for that single but after he swipes away a straight delivery Ibrahim struggles against the tall bowler\u2019s extra bounce. Ibrahim has stalled on seven from 15.      10.28am    7th over: Afghanistan 50-2 (Ibrahim 7, Gulbadin 10) Wade turns to the spin of Adam Zampa for some wickets and the leggie hits his marks from the off, sending down four dots in a tight opening over.      10.26am    6th over: Afghanistan 47-2 (Ibrahim 7, Gulbadin 7) The second edge through the slips for four of the innings sees Gulbadin get off the mark. An unconvincing straight drive for three adds further insult to Richardson\u2019s figures.      10.23am   WICKET! Gurbaz c Warner b Richardson 30 (Afghanistan 40-2)  Kane Richardson has his first bowl of the tournament, and his first delivery almost takes a wicket! Gurbaz tires to go over cow corner, gets under it, but despite the ball spending an age in the sky it lands just in front of the diving Green coming in off the midwicket fence. Green misjudged that in the air and should have done better.  Not to worry, Gurbaz aims another slog two balls later, to a delivery that wasn\u2019t there, and succeeds only in bunting a simple catch to Warner at mid-off. There\u2019s a fine line between controlled aggression and frantic slogging.      10.20am    5th over: Afghanistan 38-1 (Gurbaz 29, Ibrahim 6) Marcus Stoinis comes on as first change but Michael Clarke on commentary is not happy with the field set by Matthew Wade. According to the former skipper everything is too passive and run-saving for a side desperate for wickets. He\u2019s also not happy that Mitchell Starc has been dropped because it limits the pace attack to five similar right-armers. Afghanistan milk nine runs very professionally.      10.15am    4th over: Afghanistan 29-1 (Gurbaz 25, Ibrahim 2) Cummins is too good for Ibrahim, making Afghanistan\u2019s third right-hander fish repeatedly outside off stump then evade an effort ball that whistles past the batter\u2019s chest. After the strike\u2019s rotated Gurbaz charges at the paceman for a bottom-edged two, then holds his ground to winkle an outside edge to third for four. This is already an infuriating knock for Australia who need wickets quickly.      10.10am    3rd over: Afghanistan 22-1 (Gurbaz 19, Ibrahim 1) After five deliveries Hazlewood\u2019s over reads one run, one wicket, three dots, and it\u2019s every inch a Test match spell. Then Gurbaz rocks back and feasts on a skerrick of length to smack a six over square leg. The sound off the bat was thrilling. They are undaunted Afghanistan.      10.08am   WICKET! Ghani c Cummins b Hazlewood 2 (Afghanistan 15-1)  Hazlewood continues his right-arm over to the two right-handers and after two dots Ghani aims a wild hoick at a delivery homing in on the off bail, sending the ball high into the air for a bevy of fielders to fight over the catch. Cummins eventually takes command and completes the formalities. Very very very bad shot.      10.04am    2nd over: Afghanistan 15-0 (Gurbaz 13, Ghani 2) Cummins shares the new ball and begins neatly but after three deliveries there\u2019s a pause for Gurbaz to receive some treatment to his left shoulder. In rugby league it would be considered a stinger injury, the consequence of a minor collision with the bowler as he scampered through for a quick single. When play resumes Gurbaz ignores the pain, leans back and spanks a length delivery over the bowler\u2019s head for three.  Updated at 10.04am GMT    9.58am    1st over: Afghanistan 10-0 (Gurbaz 10, Ghani 0) Hazlewood begins with his textbook line and length, testing the top of off stump and worrying the outside edge of Gurbaz\u2019s bat. The Afghanistan opener tries to give himself room so the big paceman digs the ball into the surface and whistles one past the batter\u2019s throat. Dot, dot, dot. This doesn\u2019t look good for Gurbaz. lol. Four over cover then a massive six over square leg makes me eat my words. The first boundary was a streaky edge, the second was detonated. They only put bat on ball twice but Afghanistan are away.      9.52am    Matthew Wade rallies his troops ahead of a vital hour of cricket. Gurbaz and Ghani are out in the middle. Hazlewood has the ball in his hands.     9.47am    Now, onto the maths:      9.46am    New Zealand have now officially qualified for the semi-finals. It was a formality after their victory over Ireland earlier today, but now Australia cannot beat Afghanistan by 185 that formality has been confirmed.     9.44am   Afghanistan need 169 to win  That was most definitely not what Australia were looking for. On a blameless pitch they attacked hard from the off but failed to make their aggression count. David Warner looked in prime form before giving his wicket away, Mitchell Marsh demonstrated his power before falling, then Glenn Maxwell ran out of recognised partners at the death.  That should not take anything away from Afghanistan who bowled extremely well. Seamers Fazal and Naveen in particular excelled with changes of pace and well-executed yorkers, while Rashid\u2019s reputation counted in his favour as a modest spell went unpunished.      9.40am    20th over: Australia 168-8 (Maxwell 54, Zampa 1) Zampa squirts Fazal for a single to get off strike first ball, then Maxwell declines a rotation of strike after digging out a yorker. His decision pays off when he cracks a four through midwicket before rejecting his second single of the over. Another dot ball follows when Maxwell fails to connect with a switch-hit, but the innings ends with a conventional square drive for four.      9.36am   WICKET! Richardson run out (Naveen) 1 (Australia 159-8)  Naveen ends his superb night with 3/22 and a run out. His final over is full of guile and bravery and goes for just four runs, ending with him fielding Maxwell\u2019s drive, turning and throwing down the stumps with non-striker Richardson miles out of his ground. 19th over: Australia 159-8 (Maxwell 46, Zampa 0)   Updated at 9.37am GMT    9.32am   WICKET! Cummins c Rashid b Naveen 0 (Australia 156-7)  Naveen\u2019s brilliant night continues! A very short slower bouncer to Cummins and the Australian can\u2019t generate enough pace on the upper cut to clear Rashid Khan who slides in from the cover boundary to take a smart catch.   Updated at 9.38am GMT    9.29am    18th over: Australia 155-6 (Maxwell 43, Cummins 0) This has been a gutsy showing from Afghanistan. Australia have thrown the kitchen sink at them on a true pitch, and Warner, Marsh, and now Maxwell have all got in.      9.28am   WICKET! Wade b Fazal 6 (Australia 155-6)  Another brilliant display from Afghanistan. Fazal somehow concedes a six despite Rashid catching Maxwell on the boundary but failing to either remain in play or throw the ball back inside the rope. The bowler is unperturbed and nails his yorkers to keep Australia to singles before ripping one through Wade\u2019s attempted slog.      9.23am    17th over: Australia 146-5 (Maxwell 35, Wade 5) Back to the seam of Naveen, and he concedes just three singles in a brilliant over. He begins bowling right-arm around the wicket to Maxwell, beating the bat with a superbly disguised slower ball then nailing a yorker. A brace of slower bouncers deceive Wade\u2019s attempted pulls before Australia\u2019s pair accept singles just to keep the scoreboard moving. Naveen has been outstanding tonight.      9.17am    16th over: Australia 143-5 (Maxwell 33, Wade 4) Wade wastes no time finding the boundary, whipping Rashid behind square for a well-timed reverse sweep four. Rashid ends with 1/29.      9.15am   WICKET! Stoinis c Usman b Rashid 25 (Australia 139-5)  Rashid begins his final over with yet another drag down, and this time Stoinis feasts on it, crunching a huge six over midwicket. Ball beats bat next delivery, then Stoinis chips a loopy outside edge straight to point.  He\u2019s far from his best, but Rashid strikes at his happy hunting ground.      9.12am    15th over: Australia 133-4 (Stoinis 19, Maxwell 33) Gulbadin begins his third over but he\u2019s too short and Maxwell rocks back and slaps him disdainfully over square leg for six. A couple of singles later the Victorian whip-cracks an unstoppable lofted cover drive for four more. In amongst all that Gulbadin actually bowled really well, mixing up his pace and upsetting Australia\u2019s timing.      9.08am    14th over: Australia 121-4 (Stoinis 18, Maxwell 22) Back to Rashid, and he begins by deceiving Stoinis with a topspinner, the batter ending up in a very awkward position mid-reverse. The ball hits the pad, the appeal is confident, but declined on-field. Afghanistan review but it quickly shows the ball struck Stoinis outside the line of off stump. When he gets on strike Maxwell shows his Melbourne Stars teammate how it\u2019s done, going full switch-hit and larruping an agricultural thwack between the two fielders on the cover boundary. How does he do it? Maxy has raced to 22 off 13. Stoinis, 18 off 16, needs to pick up the pace.      9.02am    13th over: Australia 110-4 (Stoinis 18, Maxwell 14) Maxwell continues his assault by flicking Mujeeb for four behind square leg. He\u2019s then fortunate to see a mistimed drive over cover land short of the sweeper, then see a mistimed baseball-style straight slog land in front of long-off, illustrating the risk-reward of Australia\u2019s desperation for quick runs.      8.58am    12th over: Australia 102-4 (Stoinis 17, Maxwell 7) Time for Mohammad Nabi\u2019s slow off-breaks, which means it\u2019s time for Marcus Stoinis to clear his front leg and heave a mighty six over cow corner. Maxwell then gets in on the act, drilling a square drive with strong wrists through a tiny gap in the offside field and away to the cover boundary.      8.56am    11th over: Australia 88-4 (Stoinis 8, Maxwell 2) Over to you Maxy.     8.55am   WICKET! Marsh c Gurbaz b Mujeeb 45 (Australia 86-4)  Back to Mujeeb\u2019s spin after drinks and Australia deal in singles for three deliveries before Marsh sweeps, only to get a huge spiralling top edge that Gurbaz pouches with the gloves. Again Australia\u2019s charge is halted by a soft wicket.      8.50am    10th over: Australia 83-3 (Marsh 44, Stoinis 6) Australia are more circumspect against Rashid, but perhaps more on reputation than execution. The leggie has failed to fire this tournament and is lucky to get away with a couple of drag downs this over.       8.47am    9th over: Australia 78-3 (Marsh 41, Stoinis 4) Marsh gets the bandwagon rolling again with a clean straight drive for six backed up by a full swing of the bat for four over cover. Yet more poor Afghanistan fielding leads to a third boundary in a row with the legside sweeper failing to get anything behind a swivel pull. Marsh is such a powerful cricketer and he has moved to 41 off 25 in the blink of an eye.  Updated at 8.50am GMT    8.43am    8th over: Australia 64-3 (Marsh 28, Stoinis 3) Marsh begins with a sweep, Stoinis a reverse, against Rashid, which will encourage the leg-spinner on one of his home grounds. The Australian right-handers revert to the V to keep the scoreboard ticking over in singles as they consolidate following those three early wickets.  Updated at 8.50am GMT    8.39am    7th over: Australia 57-3 (Marsh 23, Stoinis 1) Gulbadin comes on and immediately Marsh is dropped at point! A loose drive to a length delivery and Najibullah turns his hands and body into spaghetti as the ball ricochets to the ground. That could have been a hammer blow. It\u2019s another good over for Afghanistan though with neither Marsh nor Stoinis demonstrating timing to Gulbadin\u2019s changes of pace. After that bright start Australia\u2019s charge is waning. Now it\u2019s time for Rashid.  Updated at 8.50am GMT    8.34am   WICKET! Smith LBW Naveen 4 (Australia 54-3)  Steve Smith now has an important role to play and he demonstrates his intent with a beautiful wristy cut behind square for four. Naveen follows up by pinning the right-hander on the pads and umpire Rusere raises the finger! Smith reviews, of course. There\u2019s no inside edge with the batter shuffling across too far to the off-side, and DRS shows the ball tracking into the pegs. Two huge wickets in the over for Afghanistan (and England)! 6th over: Australia 54-3 (Marsh 21, Stoinis 0)     8.29am   WICKET! Warner b Naveen 25 (Australia 50-2)  That\u2019s the risk of an attack-only approach. Warner alters his stance at the crease from left to right-hander to take advantage of the short boundary and field placings, but then misses a straight one and looks pretty silly. That is enormously disappointing for Australia because Warner looked in the mood tonight.   Updated at 8.29am GMT    8.26am    5th over: Australia 49-1 (Warner 25, Marsh 20) Mujeeb gets a second over soon after his first went for 16, and he\u2019s immediately looking over into the cheap seats behind square leg as Marsh drops onto one knee and times him sweetly into the sunset. Australia make do with singles thereafter as they lay the foundation for a massive total.      8.23am    4th over: Australia 38-1 (Warner 23, Marsh 11) Naveenulhaq Murid replaces Mujeed with his skiddy right-arm seamers and after a couple of singles he watches Marsh slog an edge for a one-bounce four to the unguarded third region. He then looks on in dismay as Afghanistan concede more overthrows with poor fielding and intimidating running turning one into three.  Australia are giving it their all. England will be watching on nervously.       8.17am    3rd over: Australia 27-1 (Warner 22, Marsh 1) Australia are desperately trying to force the issue but Mitchell Marsh takes three balls to get off the mark, perhaps rushing his strokes. Warner shows him how it\u2019s done, paddling an audacious four in front of midwicket with a deft bunt.      8.13am   WICKET! Green c Gulbadin b Fazal 3 (Australia 22-1)  Brilliant catch at slip from Gulbadin and Green trudges off after facing just two deliveries. Fazal angled the ball across the big right-hander, who tried to cut, but the ball was too close to his body and all he could manage was a thick edge. The ball flew high to the left of the solitary slip but he showed swift and sure hands to pouch a very good catch.  Updated at 8.13am GMT    8.11am    2nd over: Australia 22-0 (Warner 18, Green 3) David Warner is a man on a mission. He showed plenty of intent in the opening over without much timing, but in the second he made a mockery of Australia\u2019s supposed weakness against spin, taking Mujeeb Ur Rahman for plenty all around Adelaide Oval. Green is fortunate to get off the market with a thick edge for a hard-run three, but after that Warner reverse slogged for four before two more boundaries through the on-side.  Updated at 8.11am GMT    8.06am    1st over: Australia 6-0 (Warner 6, Green 0) Fazal begins with some nice shape away from Warner with his left-arm seamers. The first couple are mistimed for dots but Warner waits on the third and delivers a trademark punchy cut for four. He tips and runs to rotate the strike next ball but an overthrow brings him back to the business end. Fazal responds well, hurrying Warner up with a shorter ball then beating the outside edge with length.       8.02am    Australia\u2019s new opening partnership stride to the crease: David Warner the stocky veteran lefty, Cameron Green the giant right-handed newcomer.  Fazalhaq Farooqi has the ball\u2026     7.57am    As the teams line up for the anthems, there\u2019s just time to read about Travis Basevi, a man you might never have heard of but whose influence you\u2019ve probably felt.       7.54am         7.51am   Afghanistan XI  Rashid Khan has been declared fit despite concerns over his fitness following the defeat to Sri Lanka in Brisbane.       7.50am   Australia XI  A revamped Australian XI for their final match of the Super 12s. Cameron Green replaces the injured Aaron finch at the top of the order, Steve Smith comes in for Tim David in the middle-order, and Kane Richardson dislodges Mitchell Starc in the attack.  1 David Warner, 2 Cameron Green, 3 Mitch Marsh, 4 Steve Smith, 5 Glenn Maxwell, 6 Marcus Stoinis, 7 Matthew Wade (c/wk), 8 Pat Cummins, 9 Kane Richardson, 10 Adam Zampa, 11 Josh Hazlewood      7.44am   Afghanistan won the toss and will field first  We should be in for plenty of fireworks from Australia\u2019s top order.  Stand-in skipper Matthew Wade said he wanted to bowl first to be in better control of the net run rate calculations.      7.40am    It\u2019s dry tonight in Adelaide but Australian rain has put cricket politics in the spotlight. Here\u2019s Geoff Lemon again.  Most sports don\u2019t have to worry about being cancelled if things get wet. Cricket remains a special flower in the deluge. Tournament rain produces instant meteorologists, scoffing at the idiocy of playing a certain match in a certain place at a certain time. The same happened during the early weeks of the 2019 World Cup, the ending of which was deemed satisfactory. Rain happens wherever cricket does \u2013 that\u2019s how the grass grows. October may be slightly wetter than other Melbourne months, but it\u2019s drier than any cricket months in Sydney or Brisbane. The rainfall tends to be brief and scattered. This year it anomalously isn\u2019t. So be it.       7.36am    Have we already seen the last of Aaron Finch in an Australian uniform? He deserves his place among the greats of white ball cricket.      7.33am    Confirmation that Aaron Finch and Tim David will miss out through injury. Not only that but Mitchell Starc has been omitted (not sure why). In come Steve Smith, Cameron Green and Kane Richardson.      7.32am    Geoff\u2019s piece there condenses the net run rate issue as neatly as possible.  Australia need to beat Afghanistan  Victory by about 60 runs or within 13 overs would take Australia ahead of England on net run rate.  England then play Sri Lanka tomorrow in Sydney knowing what margin of victory is required for them to reach the semi-finals.      7.28am    Geoff Lemon sets the scene from inside the Australian camp ahead of a match full of complex equations in selection strategy, injury management, and net run rate.   Net run rate makes sense as a cricketing concept \u2013 how fast did you score compared with how well you defended? But it\u2019s not a calculation that most people can do in their heads while sitting in the stands, and the results are not intuitive at a glance in the way that something like goal difference in football is.       7.24am   New Zealand beat Ireland by 35 runs  The equation just became even more difficult for Australia and England with New Zealand completing their Super 12s campaign with a solid victory over Ireland. The Black Caps will occupy one of Group 1\u2019s spots in the semi-finals. Finn Allen continued his good form smashing 32 from 18 to start New Zealand\u2019s innings, after which skipper Kane Williamson found some form of his own with 61 from 35. A total much bigger than 185 was on offer but Ireland\u2019s Josh Little wrote his name into history with a fabulous hat-trick. The run-chase started brightly with Paul Stirling and Andy Balbirnie putting on 68 in eight overs but spinners Santner and Sodhi turned the game by dismissing Ireland\u2019s top four in quick succession.  Updated at 7.26am GMT    7.16am    Simon Doull is covering the New Zealand v Ireland match at Adelaide Oval and he has hinted strongly that Steve Smith and Cameron Green are both likely to feature for Australia with Aaron Finch and Tim David both injury doubts.     7.10am   Conditions  It\u2019s dry and we\u2019re set fair in the city of churches.  The pitch is already 40-overs old after being used by New Zealand and Ireland, and it looks a typically true Adelaide Oval strip. Afghanistan\u2019s spinners will have been encouraged by the turn and bounce on offer to Mitch Santner and Ish Sodhi.      7.05am    It\u2019s now or never for teams looking to progress from the Super 12s, and as Geoff Lemon reports the state of play is far from straightforward for some of the tournament favourites.  Arriving at this tournament, England and Australia would have been worldly enough to know that they couldn\u2019t expect to walk out of this group. They were diplomatic enough to cite every opponent as a tough competitor who could beat them on a given day. They were seasoned enough to know that this was true. And in their hearts, they would still have known that they should be the two to progress. The two biggest and best-resourced teams, one the host, the other the pace-setter in short form cricket for the last seven years.       6.59am   Preamble  Hello everybody and welcome to live coverage of the 2022 ICC Men\u2019s T20 World Cup. Australia vs Afghanistan in Group 1 of the Super 12s begins at Adelaide Oval at 6.30pm local time (7pm AEDT/8am GMT). This may be the final time we see the hosts and defending champions this tournament with Australia\u2019s fate almost out of their hands. To reach the semi-finals they must defeat Afghanistan tonight and then hope England fail against Sri Lanka tomorrow. If both old enemies prevail progress comes down to net run rate, which is firmly in England\u2019s favour, and moreover, they will know exactly the task facing them when they complete their Super 12s assignment in Sydney.  The first part of the home side\u2019s equation should be straightforward enough. Afghanistan are the only one of the dozen sides in this stage of the world cup yet to register a win. Australia, while not firing on all cylinders, should have the artillery to blow through a fragile batting order. The second part may not be so straightforward. It has become clich\u00e9 to question Australia\u2019s abilities against deliveries that move sideways, and techniques will surely be tested against Afghanistan\u2019s trio of spinners, a list that includes Rashid Khan, who has dominated the Big Bash League for Adelaide Strikers on this ground.  In a demonstration of cricket\u2019s miserable scheduling, this is just the fourth time these teams have met in international competition, and the first in T20 internationals.  There\u2019s plenty more to get through before play gets underway, during which feel free to drop me an email or, if Twitter hasn\u2019t burned to the ground, send a tweet or two to @JPHowcroft.   "

Under the headline \u201cMessi\u2019s crowning glory\u201d, the Guardian\u2019s Barney Ronay calls it \u201cthe greatest Fifa World Cup final ever played\u201d, and \u2013 more tellingly \u2013 a coronation for \u201cthe greatest footballer of the age\u201d.  The Mail outlines \u201cThe agony\u2026 and the ecstasy\u201d, as French star Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 is consoled by President Emmanuel Macron, and Lionel Messi celebrates Argentina\u2019s win with his family.  The Sun calls it the \u201cgreatest World Cup final \u2026 since 1966\u201d, with a full-page image of Lionel Messi lifting the trophy and the headline \u201cIn the hand of God\u201d.  The back page of the Express reports Messi as saying, \u201cthat his career is now complete after Argentina edged out France in a thrilling World Cup final penalty shoot-out.\u201d Above the banner, \u201cDream world\u201d, the paper carries an image of the Argentinian star being carried on the shoulders of his teammates.  The Metro calls it the \u201cCrowning glory\u201d, and despite writing that Qatar was almost certainly his \u201clast tilt at World Cup glory\u201d, the paper quotes Messi as saying \u201cI\u2019m not going to retire from the national team \u2026 I want to keep playing.\u201d Its front page image carries the headline: \u201cMess hysteria\u201d.

The Telegraph\u2019s back page carries another full-page image of Messi, with the simple headline, \u201cMiraculous. Magical. Messi.\u201d  The i calls Messi the \u201cgreatest of all time\u201d. The paper says he has now joined the \u201cranks of Pel\u00e9 and Maradona as he guides Argentina to World Cup glory in the most gripping final in history\u201d.

                    "body": "At this rate Gareth Southgate is going to have to bow to public pressure and stuff his team with attackers when England face Iran in their opening game at the World Cup next month. The defensive concerns are mounting for England\u2019s manager. If the possibility of John Stones returning from the hamstring injury that forced him off against Germany last month is a positive, then it is counteracted by Harry Maguire\u2019s exile from Manchester United\u2019s starting XI and Kyle Walker undergoing groin surgery last week. Even someone with Walker\u2019s recovery speed will find it hard to win the race to be fit for Qatar and, given there is no guarantee Stones will not break down again, it means there are doubts over every member of Southgate\u2019s ideal back three.  No pressure, then, Eric Dier. The Tottenham centre-back has enjoyed an impressive return to form under Antonio Conte and looks certain to start in the middle of the back three against Iran. The problems, though, have continued to pile up for Southgate this week. First came Gabriel Martinelli tormenting Trent Alexander-Arnold before the Liverpool right-back departed with an ankle injury during his team\u2019s defeat by Arsenal last Sunday; then, at San Siro on Tuesday, there was the sight of Reece James going off with a knee injury during Chelsea\u2019s 2-0 win against Milan, whose hopes of regaining control of their Champions League group were squashed by Fikayo Tomori being sent off in the 18th minute. While Graham Potter sounded optimistic about James \u2013 it is understood the right wing-back, who is making himself undroppable for club and country, will not be out for long \u2013 the mood around Tomori was gloomier. The defender\u2019s evening was not supposed to end in such rancour and disappointment. Tomori had a point to prove against his old team, especially after failing to impress when Milan lost 3-0 at Stamford Bridge last week, and the general view was that he was unfortunate to be dismissed for a soft foul on Mason Mount after James sent the midfielder through on goal. Did the punishment fit the crime? Daniel Siebert was right to award a penalty, but did he have to give a red? The contact was minimal and many people felt Tomori deserved a caution. Equally, Tomori made no genuine attempt to play the ball and it was possible to understand why the referee felt the 24-year-old had denied Mount an obvious goalscoring opportunity.  Using that cold logic, it becomes harder to see Southgate trusting Tomori. He is likely to look past the debate over the red and focus on the defensive frailties. He will analyse how Mount got the wrong side of Tomori, who made matters worse by panicking as he tried to stop his fellow Chelsea academy graduate from shooting. Southgate will surely conclude Tomori is not ready for a place in England\u2019s starting XI. Southgate has never been convinced about Tomori. He did not bow to the clamour to pick him instead of Maguire as the left-sided centre-back during England\u2019s Nations League matches against Italy and Germany. Tomori was not given a minute, even though Maguire\u2019s struggles continued against Germany, and his difficulties against Chelsea will even leave him at risk of not making the squad. While that may sound drastic, there was an acceptance Tomori needed to shine during Milan\u2019s double-header against Chelsea. Impressing in Serie A is one thing, but Chelsea are a step up on anything Tomori faces in Italy. It is not insular for Southgate to place more importance on performances from defenders playing in the Premier League. The quality of the opposition is higher and the pace quicker. Tomori, who has admitted his form has not been up to scratch this season, could not contain Chelsea. He was poor at Stamford Bridge, wilting under an early aerial barrage. He lacked composure and was at fault for Chelsea\u2019s second goal, his failure to cut out a cross from James allowing the unmarked Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang to make it 2-0 from close range. More was expected from a player who helped Milan to win the Scudetto last season. Back on home turf, though, Tomori could not even rely on his pace to get him out of trouble when he allowed Mount to get goalside. The red card was instant and if Tomori does miss out on the World Cup that may well be the moment when Southgate crossed his name off the list. At the same time Southgate is not blessed with many reliable alternatives to his first-choice defenders. Crystal Palace\u2019s Marc Gu\u00e9hi is inexperienced and Ben White, who has been impressing at right-back for Arsenal, missed out on the last camp. Given Southgate likes to pick those he trusts, do not rule out a recall for Aston Villa\u2019s Tyrone Mings, Maguire\u2019s deputy at Euro 2020. Compromises could be required. There is time for injuries to heal before the 26-man squad is named, but the situation at the back is not ideal. So much of England\u2019s approach is about defensive stability. For Southgate, who has repeatedly stressed the importance of balance at international level, uncertainty is something to avoid."

                    "body": "Yes. \u2018Abusing the cup? It was ever thus, the upside is a festival of popular internationalism\u2019 \u2018How do you solve a problem like Qatar?\u201d Even Julie Andrews belting it out is perhaps not a terrace anthem yet but certainly what fans, and non-fans, have been pondering the last few years \u2013 a debate due to reach fever pitch (sic) as the tournament opens next Sunday. Treating Qatar as simply the latest World Cup to be used as a political platform, and to observe there is nothing remotely unusual about this, would be a start. At the 1934 World Cup, in Italy, Mussolini\u2019s blackshirts explicitly used the Italian national team to build support for fascism, winning their home tournament, and winning again in France four years later, the first team to win an away World Cup. Harold Wilson declared after England\u2019s 1966 win: \u201cHave you noticed we only win the World Cup under a Labour government?\u201d That was one old Labour pledge that has stood the test of time, more\u2019s the pity. In 1973, the Soviet team were expelled from the tournament for refusing to take part in a qualifying play-off against Chile following Pinochet\u2019s coup. Chile, on the other hand, were welcomed to take the last place as a result. Or the last tournament, Putin\u2019s World Cup, just four years after his annexation \u2013 aka invasion \u2013 of Crimea, while this time all Russian participation has been banned. Qatar using and abusing the World Cup \u2013 it was ever thus. This is the downside of football as the one truly global sport. Yes, rugby (both versions) and cricket (all versions) have their world cups but they\u2019re not truly global, are they? These are sports fundamentally framed by empire, with the odd other international hangers-on who can score upsets but never get remotely close to the latter stages of the tournament. The winners of football\u2019s World Cup are a likewise select few from Europe and South America, but the teams that make it to the semi- and quarter-finals come from every continent, every corner of the world. This is the upside, a World Cup as a festival of popular internationalism. I\u2019m lucky enough to have gone as an England fan to four World Cups, including Asia\u2019s first, Japan and South Korea 2002, and Africa\u2019s first, South Africa 2010. Never mind \u2013 well, actually I do mind, a lot \u2013 that England didn\u2019t come close to lifting the trophy, the experience was unforgettable. Yes, it\u2019s a holiday of privilege but being there is also inextricably mixed with, despite the unfamiliarity and the differences, what we share as visitors with our hosts, the love of football. That\u2019s what Qatar should be about: the first Middle Eastern World Cup, good; the first in a majority Muslim country, good. But of course, we all know it won\u2019t be about that \u2013 and that is a huge loss, barely recognised. To boycott or not to boycott? Let\u2019s be brutally honest: it\u2019s a non-question. England exit in ignominy at the group stage and the boycott will be unstoppable. Wales march on triumphantly to the knock-out stages and there\u2019s a tidal wave of Welsh solidarity with their team. Because when it comes down to it, for the next four weeks any moral gymnastics can be reduced to four words. Love football, not Fifa. \u2022 Mark Perryman is the author of books including Ingerland: Travels With a Football Nation No. \u2018To watch it would make me complicit. A passive approver of homophobia\u2019 I support football. I\u2019ve loved it since I was a child, when I\u2019d sit in front of Match of the Day every Saturday night with my grandad. I\u2019m a lifelong Liverpool fan and spend my weekends (and many week nights) shouting and arguing with a television set. When the World Cup rolls around there are dizzy levels of anticipation and by this stage I\u2019m usually poised and ready, the rest of my life cleverly rearranged around a very crowded fixtures list. This time, however, I\u2019ve decided not to watch. I never imagined I\u2019d say this, yet with Fifa choosing to hold the tournament in Qatar (a decision Beth Mead, Arsenal and England forward, describes with heavy understatement as \u201cdisappointing\u201d), I\u2019m left with no other option. In Qatar, homosexuality is illegal and was recently described by Qatar World Cup ambassador Khalid Salman as \u201cdamage in the mind\u201d. More than that, under strict Sharia law, anyone \u201cengaging in homosexuality\u201d faces being fined, imprisoned or even executed. Qatar\u2019s human rights record is abysmal. Women\u2019s rights, freedom of expression and assembly are all suppressed under Qatari regulations, while Amnesty International continues to push for its fair treatment of migrant workers (the Guardian reported that 6,500 migrant workers have died since Qatar won the right to host in 2010 \u2013, a figure officials bizarrely describe as \u201cmisleading\u201d). The competition\u2019s organisers state that everyone is welcome to attend the matches, but with its chief executive, Nasser al-Khater, adding that any visitors must \u201crespect our culture\u201d. I respect and admire many things about Islamic culture. But not this. To watch would make me complicit. A passive approver of homophobia and misogyny. How can I watch a tournament held in a country where some of my friends could face the death penalty, purely for quietly and peacefully living their lives. I support football, but more importantly, I support the idea of an existence free from fear, violence and discrimination. Many, including Piers Morgan, suggest we should \u201cjust enjoy the football\u201d and sport shouldn\u2019t be political. But everything is political (the fact that Qatar, the \u201crichest country in the world\u201d, was successful in its bid to host is a huge political statement in itself). Others have implied engagement \u201chighlights the issues\u201d, a fumbling defence used by World Cup commentator Gary Neville when recently challenged so exquisitely by Ian Hislop on Have I Got News For You. No, Gary. You can highlight the issue without sitting in a commentary box with a big fat pay cheque in your back pocket. Most people believe whether they watch or not will make zero difference, but if you think you are too small to count, \u201ctry sleeping with a mosquito\u201d, as the Dalai Lama says. Besides, I strongly believe it\u2019s the small decisions we make, whether we look or turn away, whether we speak out or stay silent, these are the decisions that make us who we are. Especially when no one ever sees those decisions except ourselves. So the next few weeks, at least for me, will be football-free. Will anyone care what I do? I doubt it. But if we all made that small change, if we all decided not to watch, what a very big difference that would be. \u2022 Joanna Cannon\u2019s latest novel is A Tidy Ending Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

                    "body": "As the Covid-19 pandemic ripped through London in spring 2020, the revolving doors at Claridge\u2019s stopped turning and its art deco lobby fell silent. The 220-year-old luxury Mayfair hotel, whose guests have ranged from Mick Jagger to Winston Churchill \u2013 and which was a favourite lunch spot of Queen Elizabeth II \u2013 fell foul of government guidelines that ordered venues to shut as part of efforts to halt the spread of the virus. Like most hotel businesses, Claridge\u2019s \u2013 and the Maybourne Hotel Group that owns it \u2013 claimed furlough cash to fund wages for its waiters, porters and managers as the pandemic choked off business. All told, Maybourne entities, including its Connaught, Berkeley and the not-yet-opened Emory hotel, claimed up to \u00a312m, according to records obtained by the Guardian. Meanwhile, work continued on the \u00a3800m renovation of the quartet, including a luxury subterranean spa at Claridge\u2019s, to enhance the value of the jewel in the crown of its royal proprietors. Maybourne is part of the growing empire of prestige assets belonging to the phenomenally wealthy ruling elite of Qatar, the gas-rich emirate due to host the upcoming football World Cup. Its ultimate beneficial owners are the former emir of Qatar Hamad bin Khalifa al-Thani, sometimes known as HBK, and the businessman and former prime minister Hamad bin Jassim bin Jaber al-Thani (HBJ), who together have masterminded Qatar\u2019s investment in the UK, including deals to buy Harrods and the financing of the Shard. HBJ made headlines recently when the Sunday Times revealed that he had given \u20ac3m (\u00a32.6m), including cash stuffed into a Fortnum &amp; Mason bag, to King Charles \u2013 then the Prince of Wales \u2013 for his charity. The cash was handed over in three lots between 2011 and 2015. But that windfall, not to mention the money that the Al-Thanis saved by accepting the taxpayer\u2019s furlough largesse, is small beer compared with another prize now at stake.  The Qatari aristocracy are embroiled in a multibillion-pound legal fight over the no-expense-spared overhaul of Claridge\u2019s. Now that fight is about to escalate, with the embattled Swiss bank Credit Suisse set to become the latest entity dragged into a bitter dispute between former friends. The tussle revolves around the true value of Maybourne\u2019s portfolio of luxury hotels and the impact that this price tag has on an agreement between the Qataris and Paddy McKillen, a Belfast-born hotelier who has overseen the renovation. The result of McKillen\u2019s work has wowed critics. The penthouse suite, featuring a Steinway piano, is expected to carry a per-night price tag of \u00a3100,000 when it opens later this year. Claridge\u2019s did not have a spa before but McKillen\u2019s builders have put one in, digging out a five-floor excavation below the famous black and white lobby, at times with their hands, to avoid any uncouth rumblings disturbing the guests who have returned post-pandemic. In the Japan-inspired treatment rooms, guests are treated to floral kimonos instead of the usual robe and slippers. They can choose from a vast menu of treatments, or relax in a private cabana amid the stone pillars surrounding the swimming pool. As peaceful as the result of the makeover may be, the war over the value created by it is likely to be long, expensive and bitter, with one insider noting: \u201cNobody is going to win except the lawyers.\u201d A second source close to the dispute said that the Qataris appeared to be ready to spend \u201ctens of millions\u201d on legal fees, arraying their almost unrivalled financial power against McKillen\u2019s stomach for the fight. That battle pits McKillen against his erstwhile friend and saviour, HBJ. The Belfast boy had acquired a stake of just over a third in the hotels in 2004, as part of a consortium led by the Irish real estate investor Derek Quinlan. When the financial crash capsized Quinlan\u2019s property empire, the billionaire Barclay brothers swooped in and tried to wrest control of the hugely prestigious assets. McKillen did not want to relinquish control without a fight but ultimately he had a choice: either rack up huge and risky levels of debt to buy out the Barclays or enlist a wealthy backer. In stepped HBJ, whose financial firepower dwarfed even that of the Barclays. He bought out the brothers\u2019 64% stake and threw his weight behind McKillen, who possessed not just the other 36% but a wealth of valuable expertise in how to run luxury hotels. What happened next has become the crux of a prolonged and costly legal dispute. Under an agreement between the business partners, HBJ and HBK would increase their stake to 100%, clearing McKillen\u2019s debts in the process and giving his business, Hume Street Management Consultants, a lucrative seven-year contract to spruce up the hotels to match the world-beating standards of luxury living that the Qataris expected. McKillen would get 36% of the resulting increase in the hotels\u2019 value above the \u00a31.3bn price tag that had been set by the Qataris\u2019 initial investment, with deductions for the costs the Gulf owners incurred paying for the work. The deal seemed to work for everyone. However, in April this year, it became clear that there was trouble in paradise. McKillen and his longtime associate Liam Cunningham were unceremoniously jettisoned from the board of Maybourne Hotels, amid a dispute over his share of the hotels\u2019 increased value. It is thought that McKillen is claiming that the portfolio is worth upwards of \u00a35bn, a near fourfold increase since 2015 that could see him pocket seven figures. The Qataris beg to differ, to the point that it is unclear whether McKillen will receive anything at all. Another point of difference rests on whether hotels in Beverly Hills and the French riviera, which the Qataris argue were added to the portfolio after their deal with McKillen, should be included. Factoring them in would increase McKillen\u2019s payout. Both sides say that the contract between McKillen and the Qataris is unambiguous and favours their own interpretation of events. Given how far apart the two sides are in their valuations \u2013 by a factor of 500% according to one source \u2013 a settlement appears unlikely. One way to arrive at a valuation is to ask an independent bank to estimate the price tag. To that end, HBJ and HBK are understood to have asked Credit Suisse to do the job. But an arbitration process, expected to start within days, is expected to consider whether the Swiss bank can really be considered independent. Qatar Holding, the investment vehicle of the Gulf state, owns 5% of Credit Suisse. HBJ\u2019s son Jassim bin Hamad is a former director of the bank, although he stood down in 2017. Credit Suisse declined to comment. While the legal process plays out, HBJ can take comfort in having full control over London\u2019s most famous hotels, with the possible exception of the Ritz and the Savoy, which both happen to be wholly or partly owned by Qatar or its ruling elite.  Shortly before McKillen was ousted, HBJ installed several new members on the board. They include his son Mohammed bin Hamad bin Jassim and his right-hand man, the Italian banker Michele Faissola, who was recently cleared on appeal, having been given a jail sentence as part of a probe into the falsification of accounts at the Italian bank Monte dei Paschi di Siena in 2019. Faissola, head of HBJ\u2019s family office Dilmon, is said to be a key figure at 67 Brook Street, a former home of the Bee Gees that has become the London nerve centre for HBJ\u2019s many business interests in Britain \u2013 and a stone\u2019s throw from Claridge\u2019s. Many of the guests enjoying Claridge\u2019s genteel and peaceful surroundings will be blissfully unaware that their bed for the night is the subject of such an unseemly and acrimonious brawl. As for the 210-year-old hotel and its staff, they have surely seen it all. McKillen declined to comment. Maybourne Hotels and its owners did not return a request for comment."

                    "body": "  11.44am    Five more days of World Cup group stage cricket ahead, with the circus going to Adelaide tomorrow: Zimbabwe play Netherlands first, before India take on Bangladesh in a massive game that evening local time. We\u2019ll have plenty of coverage across the Guardian over that time, so stay tuned. Jos Buttler is player of the match, and England win tonight in Brisbane. Till next time.   Updated at 12.07pm GMT    11.41am    What does it mean for the Group A table? It means that New Zealand, England and Australia each have five points, and are ranked in the order above thanks to net run rate. So New Zealand will still finish top if they beat Ireland, with a far superior rate. England can finish second if they beat Sri Lanka, but they could also be pushed to third if Australia can beat Afghanistan by enough to make up a net run rate deficit. Of course, should any of these teams lose their final match, they\u2019re gone.      11.38am    A brilliant night for Buttler, his 73 from 47 balls has him looking good ahead of the final round of matches. Hales did a job too with 52 from 40, including making the early running when Buttler was yet to launch. Livingstone\u2019s 20 from 14 ended up being useful in the circumstances. What England also did was take down New Zealand\u2019s fast bowlers, who had been going so well. Each of Boult, Southee and Ferguson went for more than 40 from their four overs. 3 for 128 between them from 12 overs. It was the spinners who kept New Zealand in it, 2 for 48 from eight overs.  England\u2019s quicks fared better: Wood 1 for 25 from three overs, Curran 2 for 26 from four, Woakes 2 for 33 from four. England\u2019s spinners were also good though, Rashid creating a lot of the mid-innings squeeze, Livingstone doing a job, and for me, the early use of Moeen tilted the match: New Zealand weren\u2019t expecting him to open the bowling and were thrown off balance. Phillips with 62 from 36 did his best to repair the damage, and Williamson did a job in going with him, but with 40 from 40 he needed to push the accelerator himself a bit harder.      11.31am   England win by 20 runs!  What were you all so worried about, England supporters? I had a few near me who were on the verge of weeping when Phillips hit those sixes. But it was always a huge ask. England could have made their night more comfortable had the middle-innings batting backed up the opening partnership. New Zealand had the opposite problem \u2013 the opening batting basically tanked the innings before it had begun.   Updated at 11.34am GMT    11.29am    20th over: New Zealand 159-6 (Santner 16, Sodhi 6) You\u2019re not going to get 26 with Sodhi on strike. He misses the first one and pulls a single from the second, leaving Santner needing to hit the last four balls for six to go\u2026 dare we say it\u2026 \u201cinto the Super Over!\u201d Santner does not hit the last four balls for six. He does get a wide form Curran, meaning that four sixes will win it. But he still does not hit them for six. He drives a couple, misses a bouncer, can\u2019t hit the yorker, and basically Curran\u2019s death bowling gets a free inspection and receives its certificate.      11.23am    19th over: New Zealand 154-6 (Santner 13, Sodhi 5) Woakes with the ball to finish his night\u2019s work: 2 for 20 off his first three overs. Santner hasn\u2019t quite given up yet though. A couple of twos, a wide from what should be the last ball, and then Santner gets just enough on a baseball shot against the replacement delivery to clear long on for six. 26 needed off the last over.      11.18am    18th over: New Zealand 139-6 (Santner 2, Sodhi 3) It was a good shot from Phillips to start against Curran, out to deep cover but it was well tapped back by Brook. That kept them to three runs and got Santner on strike, who took a single. Phillips falls next, and Ish Sodhi comes in to swing three runs of his own via a top edge. With 40 needed from two overs, this would take some losing for England.      11.15am   WICKET! Phillips c sub b Curran 62 (36 balls), New Zealand 135-6  That\u2019s the game! Phillips knows he has to take on Curran at some stage, and tries to do over long on. The super-sub, Jordan, is there. To be fair, his catches have been routine for a good fielder, and he\u2019s replacing Livingstone who is also one of England\u2019s best.  Updated at 11.37am GMT    11.12am   WICKET! Mitchell c sub b Woakes 3 (5 balls), New Zealand 131-5  17th over: New Zealand 131-5 (Phillips 59) Now the runs dry up again, with Woakes from the Vulture Street End. Singles, a two, a drive back to the bowler. You can feel the pressure dialling up on Mitchell ball by ball, he knows he has to be the one to produce the special shot. By the sixth ball it\u2019s almost a free hit for Mitchell, end of the over, wanting to leave Phillips on strike for the next and help the score balance, so he swings big, gets most of it down to long on, but not enough to clear Chris Jordan, England\u2019s best substitute fielder, who as an extreme surprise is on the field near the end of a T20 International that he\u2019s not playing in for the umpteenth time. 49 in 18 balls needed.   Updated at 11.46am GMT    11.05am    16th over: New Zealand 123-4 (Phillips 57, Mitchell 0) Wood finishes a first-rate over, with pace at Daryl Mitchell who can\u2019t score off either delivery he faces. Three runs and the key wicket from the over. New Zealand need 54 in 24.  Updated at 11.16am GMT    11.02am   WICKET! Neesham c Curran b Wood 6 (3 balls), New Zealand 126-4  He didn\u2019t waste any time, at least. Neesham sees Wood drop short and takes on the pull shot. More top than middle though, and Curran runs around a long way from deep midwicket towards deep square leg to take a good running catch. Brandishes the ball to the crowd!   Updated at 11.13am GMT    10.58am    15th over: New Zealand 123-3 (Phillips 56, Neesham 4) First ball to the middle, last ball of the over, and Neesham pulls it for four! Fetches it from well outside the off stump, the left-hander. Through midwicket. Phillips had also pulled a boundary before the Williamson dismissal. Left-hand and right-hand combination at the crease too. Ten from the over. 57 needed in 30.  Updated at 11.16am GMT    10.56am   WICKET! Williamson c Rashid b Stokes 40 (40 balls), New Zealand 119-3  Stokes into the game! Bowls a short ball that follows Williamson, who is trying to glide it past short third, but is surprised by the movement. Hits it finer than intended, to Rashid in that position. He was providing stability at a run a ball to support Phillips, but perhaps some power at the other end could be more useful in these last few overs? Jimmy Neesham to the crease.   Updated at 11.04am GMT    10.52am    14th over: New Zealand 113-2 (Williamson 39, Phillips 51) Rashid comes back. Three overs for 16 runs so far. They\u2019ve let him get away with far too much. And Phillips is of a like mind. Six! Getting back to the shorter ball, pulling it away over the fence. And for the first time tonight, he follows up a hit with another. Six more! As Rashid goes fuller to compensate, and Phillips drops to one knee and pulverises it into the stands. Places a brace to deep cover to follow. Singles after that. Fifty up for Phillips. The over costs 17 runs. New Zealand still need 67 off 36. Still a long way off.     10.46am    13th over: New Zealand 96-2 (Williamson 37, Phillips 36) A few sneaky bonus runs for New Zealand: they run on a wide, then get an overthrow from a direct hit at the non-striker\u2019s end. Can\u2019t latch onto Curran though, despite a couple of Phillips attempts. Eight off the over with no boundary. 84 in 42 needed. The attendance for tonight, per earlier discussions, is 22,547. That\u2019s more than half for the Gabba, a good result. A lot of New Zealanders in Queensland, which probably helps.  Updated at 10.53am GMT    10.41am    12th over: New Zealand 86-2 (Williamson 34, Phillips 30) Mark Wood is back, off that long run from the Stanley Street End. A clip from Phillips, who smartly runs back for two. So Wood sends down a bouncer that Phillips evades. That might be the length, because when Wood pitches up again, Phillips drives him for six! What a shot that is. North of 90 miles an hour inbound, and about as quickly outbound, via a simple swing of the bat that plonks it among the spectators at long on. Only four runs from the other five balls though. 94 runs needed at 48.   Updated at 10.43am GMT    10.36am    11th over: New Zealand 76-2 (Williamson 34, Phillips 21) There\u2019s a symbolic one for you. Livingstone bowls a fat, dripping full toss, and Williamson tucks it through midwicket for two. Just haven\u2019t had the foot down as required tonight, New Zealand. Phillips gets another and drives it down the ground for one. He has more luck from his accidental shots: an outside edge that beats the keeper and short third for four, then a top edged sweep that gets him two. Ten off the over is better, but fortune can claim most of them.      10.32am    10th over: New Zealand 66-2 (Williamson 29, Phillips 16) Rashid\u2019s wet-blanket routine continues, smothering the scoring by landing on a good length, and eventually the pressure tells. Phillips has a gallop, has a swing, slices it up to cover\u2026 and Moeen drops the catch. Another simple one down at the Gabba. There is a low ring of lights here, down under the roof level, and they might be on an angle to get in players\u2019 eyes. We\u2019ve seen some straightforward ones dropped by good fielders. Still, only four off the over, and New Zealand have batted themselves into a hole. Williamson 29 off 29, and they need nearly 12 an over, 114 off 60 balls.      10.28am    9th over: New Zealand 62-2 (Williamson 27, Phillips 14) Set and forget for Liam Livingstone: just keeps bowling fast and on a length, and Williamson and Phillips keep getting on the front foot to tap a run or two to the off side. Until the last ball, that is, when Williamson gets a stride in and throws his hands through the ball. Lovely placement, beating the deep extra cover sweeper to the square side for four. Nine off the over, still below the required rate. 118 needed in 66.      10.25am    8th over: New Zealand 53-2 (Williamson 20, Phillips 12) Another good over of spin, Adil Rashid on the money and the Kiwis only work a run a ball. They have to get moving. They need 127 runs from 12 overs, or 72 balls.      10.22am    7th over: New Zealand 47-2 (Williamson 17, Phillips 9) Stokes is back on the field after getting checked up on. Livingstone bowls his liquorice allsorts spin, looks like leg-breaks to the right-handers tonight. Fast and skiddy and tight on the stumps, and mostly a bit short, drawing plenty of cut shots. Nobody middles one until Phillips from the last ball of the over, behind point for four, but that\u2019s after Buttler has missed a catch off Phillips that hits the keeper on his body.      10.19am    6th over: New Zealand 40-2 (Williamson 15, Phillips 4) That\u2019s skill from Williamson. Mark Wood bowling, seriously fast, full and straight and Williamson clips it off his toes, square enough to beat the deep fine leg into the fence. Phillips is much less convincing, going the other side of that fine leg fielder via an inside edge. The radar is tracking Mark Wood at 155 kilometres per hour. The readings have been slightly on the generous side through this tournament, we\u2019ve had half a dozen bowlers over 150 supposedly, which stretches credulity. But he is bowling rapidly, whatever the measure.      10.15am    5th over: New Zealand 28-2 (Williamson 8) Again the wicket falls from the last ball of an over, and it concedes only two runs. They\u2019re just about out of this already, New Zealand. Wickets can happen, but it\u2019s been an awful start in terms of run rate.      10.13am   WICKET! Allen c Stokes b Curran 16 (11 balls), New Zealand 28-2  That\u2019s the big one. Allen is the player who can carve off a huge chunk of a chase in quick time, and he\u2019s gone for relatively few. Swings across the line at Curran, regulation to Stokes trotting in from deep midwicket, though Stokes looks like he may have hurt his index finger taking the catch. He comes off the field and Chris Jordan replaces him.   Updated at 10.23am GMT    10.07am    4th over: New Zealand 26-1 (Allen 15, Williamson 7) Well, I was wondering where that Finn Allen was who took apart Australia to start the tournament. There\u2019s a sighting of him here, with a huge pick-up shot over midwicket that eludes Harry Brook for six. That\u2019s the power, then Williamson has the clever touch, waiting on a short ball and pulling it fine behind square for four. A dozen from Woakes.     10.03am    3rd over: New Zealand 14-1 (Allen 8, Williamson 2) More spin in the Powerplay, with Adil Rashid brought on early. That works as well: Allen\u2019s reverse hit for three is the only high-yield shot in the over, with six from it all up.      10.01am    2nd over: New Zealand 8-1 (Allen 4) So that\u2019s another win for England across the first two overs, with Kane Williamson heading to the middle to start the third.      10.00am   WICKET! Conway c Buttler b Woakes 3 (9 balls), New Zealand 8-1  There\u2019s the early one they needed! Chris Woakes bowls a poor ball, half-tracker on leg stump. Conway for reasons best known to himself decides to ramp it rather than baseball it out of the ground. He gets it very fine and Buttler dives across and makes up good ground to take the catch. Or does he? There\u2019s an umpire check before Conway leaves the ground. On the replay you can\u2019t see if the ball hits the ground as Buttler lands, because his gloves were in the way. But he pretty much just gets up and lobs the ball back to the umpire rather than celebrating. There\u2019s no visual of ball hitting ground, so the catch stands. Something feels a bit out of kilter about all of that.    Updated at 10.13am GMT    9.54am    1st over: New Zealand 4-0 (Allen 3, Conway 1) Here\u2019s a surprise from Buttler: Moeen Ali opens the bowling. And it foxes New Zealand. They\u2019re not expecting this. He bowls an outstanding over too, nearly getting Conway stumped with width, then burrowing one off the inside edge into pad, could have been caught or gone back onto the stumps. Only four runs from it! Early advantage England.      9.47am    Tom van der Gucht writes in. \u201cIt\u2019s interesting what you were saying about England looking better on paper than in the flesh at the moment. It got me thinking about how quickly form can change within this format: two weeks ago, England were on a roll after dismantling Pakistan at home and taking down the Aussies in their own backyard only for the wheels to come off since. \u201cMy general theory about cricket is that whatever hasn\u2019t happened or hasn\u2019t happened for a while is due to happen at some point, especially so in T20. This vaguely formed and nebulous spiritual cricketing philosophy became more solid in my mind during the test match summer when England kept beating the odds. According to my theory, NZ are due a loss and England as due a big win. Today, hopefully, will be that day it happens.\u201d I think I\u2019m with you. Form is massively overstated, especially in this format, and gets confused with what is simply results. Good form and bad form does exist, but every streak of good or bad results gets classified as form.      9.43am    \u201cGood morning from a rainy Manchester, Geoff,\u201d writes Matt Hobbs. A great city, send it my best. \u201cAn element of irony to that run chase, in my opinion. England were criticised for retaining their batting order against Ireland and yet left themselves short of a finisher or two in the dying moments after shunting Ali and Livingstone up.  \u201cStokes will have to bowl/field his socks off if the gamble in bringing him back into the T20 side isn\u2019t going to look more unnecessary than it already does. Is it time for Adil Rashid to shrug off indifferent form and shine? Let\u2019s hope so!\u201d     9.42am    Ladka emails in. \u201cG\u2019day Geoff. Has Australia really fallen out of love with cricket? I know AFL is big but these crowds have been quite shocking. Resembled English county grounds. Hopefully Buttler and Hales can take the game away from the Kiwis.\u201d Well, they kinda did. And looking out the window at the Gabba tonight, sure, I can see a lot of those seats with their distinctive vomitorium colour scheme, but it\u2019s a huge ground and a very solid crowd in tonight. I\u2019ll see if we get the official numbers later.  Drawing massive home audiences to neutral group was never especially likely, unless the likes of Sri Lanka or India are playing with big diaspora fanbases. So, no concerns from me about this crowd. Some of the other games have had far smaller ones, but again, a Bangladesh-Zimbabwe match isn\u2019t going to be the biggest drawcard in town.      9.38am    So a good score for England, but they didn\u2019t take advantage of the start that Buttler and Hales gave them. They lost 4 for 23 in those last few overs, and it took the pace out of the innings even as Buttler was doing his utmost to keep it up. His run out at the non-striker\u2019s end was more than a little symbolic. Still! 180 is 180, it\u2019s a tall task and it will take a big performance from New Zealand to keep being the only unbeaten team in the group.  Updated at 9.47am GMT    9.35am    20th over: England 179-6 (Curran 6, Malan 3) Quite the over. A two and a one as Stokes swings and can\u2019t get much of either. Curran does get hold of one! With Ferguson\u2019s pace, the shot over midwicket beats the diving Santner on the rope and is parried over. It was going the distance anyway. But Curran doesn\u2019t get another swing, because he gets a beamer and almost falls over evading it, then is called through for a bye. But Stokes can only get two runs from the free hit, a yorker well bowled, and then is out to the next one. Dawid Malan comes out after being bumped all the way down the order and clips the last ball for three, scrambling up and back and New Zealand keep misfielding. That\u2019s a strike rate of 300 for the maligned first drop. And there\u2019s that target of 180 for New Zealand. Game on.    Updated at 9.53am GMT    9.32am   WICKET! Stokes lbw Ferguson 8 (6 balls), England 176-6  Stokes just about walks for that one. On the back boot in front of middle stump. But team policy apparently requires a review. He\u2019s as out as he looked.   Updated at 10.00am GMT    9.28am    19th over: England 163-5 (Stokes 3, Curran 0) After that malarkey, Stokes nudges a single to midwicket. With eight balls to go. In a T20 innings.  Curran seems to understand the format better. Has a heave, misses it, but gave it a go.      9.26am   WICKET! Buttler run out 73 (47 balls), England 162-5  What a passage of play that is! People have said that Ben Stokes needs to have an influence on England\u2019s campaign, and he has here. Nails his cleanest shot of the tournament, lacing Southee, but straight at cover. Williamson stops the rocket, then has the presence of mind to hurl the throw to Southee near the stumps. Southee manages to catch that rocket, low and one handed, and swings his arm backhanded into the stumps. And Buttler is short of his ground! Backing up too far to regain safe territory. England\u2019s best player of the night has been done in.     Updated at 9.57am GMT    9.22am   WICKET! Brook c Allen b Southee 7 (3 balls), England 160-4  What else can you do? Two overs to go, so Harry Brook pumps one six over long on, then gets caught on the rope trying another. Fair deuce.   Updated at 9.31am GMT    9.20am    18th over: England 154-3 (Buttler 73, Brook 1) Only six from the Ferguson over, including the four that Livingstone lapped before the one who got him out.  Robert Lewis says he used to work in a West End pub (that\u2019s the Brisbane version of West End) and is now writing from sunny Istanbul. \u201cHow many do you reckon England need to be able to get the vital win here?\u201d At least 180 to feel comfortable, with New Zealand\u2019s power up top. But of course much lower scores can be defended with early wickets.     9.18am   WICKET! Livingstone b Ferguson 20 (14 balls), England 153-3  So the elevations of Moeen and Livingstone haven\u2019t set the game alight, though the latter did offer something. He moves across in attempting a lap shot at Ferguson, who is too fast and bursts through the shot and the stumps.   Updated at 9.54am GMT    9.15am    17th over: England 148-2 (Buttler 72, Livingstone 16) Add a near run-out to Livingstone\u2019s list, sprinting in at the non-striker\u2019s end to beat Boult in taking the bails. A direct hit would have had him. But that brings Buttler on strike, and he simply flat-bats Boult down the ground and over the small sightscreen. Boult ends up conceding 11 off the over, and 0 for 40 from his night. Pop a tick in that column for England.   Updated at 9.22am GMT    9.11am    16th over: England 137-2 (Buttler 64, Livingstone 13) A decent start for Southee in the over, but from the fifth ball Livingstone finally gets onto one. Higher than it is long, but it\u2019s plenty long enough, a straightforward swing over midwicket that ends up in the seats. Then another miscue that\u2019s nearly caught, landing in between cover and long off in another lucky break for England. A dozen from the over.     9.06am    15th over: England 125-2 (Buttler 61, Livingstone 4) No such problems against pace! Buttler absolutely hammers Boult dead straight, and a younger Tim Southee might once have sprinted across to save that, but this version didn\u2019t look entirely keen to take off with the afterburners blazing. Four runs there, four more from a pull shot to a ball that isn\u2019t super short. Livingstone is nearly caught from a skied top edge, but again Williamson running back from cover can\u2019t reach it. Boult tries the slower bouncer to end the over and keeps Livingstone to one.     9.03am    14th over: England 110-2 (Buttler 50, Livingstone 1) It is Livingstone to come in next\u2026 and he pokes around for three balls to get off strike against Sodhi. Buttler drives a single to raise his fifty, but only two runs from the wicket-taking over. New Zealand\u2019s spinners have gone for 48 from 48 balls and taken two wickets along the way.      8.59am   WICKET! Moeen Ali c Boult b Sodhi 5 (6 balls), England 108-2  Well, Moeen was there to hit the leg-spinner, so he hits the leg-spinner. A long way, to be fair. High into the night. But the deep midwicket pocket at the Gabba just gives Trent Boult enough room to move around the rope and hold the catch just inside the boundary, in front of a pocket of New Zealand fans.   Updated at 9.26am GMT    8.57am    13th over: England 108-1 (Buttler 49, Moeen 5) Big moment: Ferguson comes back on, fast and short and hooked by Buttler, flat to deep midwicket, where Daryl Mitchell drops the catch! It was travelling, but it was straight at him, hits his hands so hard that it bounces off. The crowd groans and exults in equal measure. And Buttler cashes in: a flat smack over mid off for four, then a tennis forehand against a slower bouncer, reading it and waiting to flip it over mid on. Add that to the boundary that he started the over with, another down to mid off, and he takes 14 from the lucky over.      8.52am    12th over: England 94-1 (Buttler 36, Moeen 4) Sodhi to Buttler, carbon copy of the previous over: the tucked two, the reversed four. This time the boundary is more top edge than middle. Once Moeen gets on strike he doesn\u2019t try anything huge, just dinks a couple to midwicket into the large gap there. Can\u2019t beat point with his attempted cut.      8.49am    11th over: England 85-1 (Buttler 29, Moeen 2) Moeen sent to the crease rather than Livingstone, presumably given there are spinners operating. That\u2019s despite Livingstone spending the drinks break running the boundary line like Rocky, swinging his bat furiously to warm up. Four singles from the over after the early boundary. And the wicket ball wasn\u2019t called a wide after all, which seems\u2026 well, incorrect, at least.  Also great to spend the drinks break watching some capering characters on the video screen showing us how to use the bottle recycling machines brought to us by Aramco \u2013 from memory, the oil company responsible for 4.4% of all human carbon emissions since 1965.      8.46am   WICKET! Hales st Conway b Santner 52 (40 balls), England 81-1  One ball after raising his fifty with a nick to the boundary, Hales can\u2019t survive the next mistake. Fast and very wide from Santner, outside the tram tracks, and a charging Hales can\u2019t get the toe of the bat to it. Conway beats him home, and the ball is called wide but you can still get out to one of them\u2026   Updated at 9.11am GMT    8.42am    10th over: England 77-0 (Buttler 27, Hales 48) More initiative from Buttler against Sodhi this time, walking at him to flick two runs to leg, then reversing four over backward point. Now when they tuck singles they\u2019re doing it off a scoring base for the over. Ten off it. Drinks break, because of course it is. And Liam Livingstone is padded up.      8.39am    9th over: England 67-0 (Buttler 19, Hales 46) Santner has a change of ends to bowl with Stanley Street at his back, twinning up with Sodhi, and he bowls really well to begin with. A fast one to beat Hales on the advance, then one that turns past the edge as Hales stays back. A couple of singles, then Hales drives two to deep cover. Another great over to back up Sodhi\u2019s.      8.34am    8th over: England 61-0 (Buttler 18, Hales 41) More spin, with Ish Sodhi\u2019s leg-breaks from the Vulture Street End. Caution from Hales to start, tucking a sharp single where a direct hit might have had Buttler struggling. Three runs from the over, two from the bat.      8.31am    7th over: England 58-0 (Buttler 18, Hales 39) This is the good England today. Lockie Ferguson comes on, bowling right-arm rapid, and Buttler knows how to deal with that. Gets in position, plays the ramp shot, and sends it for six! A few singles round out the over.     8.29am    6th over: England 48-0 (Buttler 8, Hales 37) Almost a blinder from Williamson! Buttler backs away and slashes Santner over the off side. Williamson runs back with the flight of the ball and dives full length. Gets it in both hands, spills into the air, and it hits the ground as he lands before bouncing back into his hands while he slides forward. He gets up and signals to the umpire that it might be a catch but he isn\u2019t sure. They check the replay and confirm the bobble off the grass. Most surprisingly, England didn\u2019t even take a run. Buttler had just started walking off. The over ends up costing eight runs, with a Hales pull for four. End of the Powerplay, Hales has made it a great one for England.   Updated at 9.05am GMT    8.22am    5th over: England 40-0 (Buttler 8, Hales 31) Whomp! Hales decides to flick the switch. Skips out a little to make room and flat-bats Southee down the ground for six. Misses the next ball, then cracks two in a row over cover for four! The second flatter and faster than the first, just above the hands of the leaping fielder. Hales backing away to make room, that\u2019s serious hand-eye ability as he swings through the line of those balls. Southee manages to defuse the situation from the last two balls and avoid a truly massive over.      8.18am    4th over: England 25-0 (Buttler 8, Hales 16) Time to tempt and test England with spin\u2026 and Mitchell Santner does an excellent job! The left-armer spears the ball through, racing through his over before Hales can blink. After a Buttler single, it takes four balls for Hales to get off strike via a leg bye. Buttler follows by dropping two in the leg side.   Updated at 9.06am GMT    8.14am    3rd over: England 21-0 (Buttler 5, Hales 16) That\u2019s what England needs! Some audacity from Hales. The ball isn\u2019t exactly overpitched from Boult, it\u2019s just slightly on the fuller side, but Hales stands still, gets under it, and lifts it over mid off for four. It flips an otherwise excellent over that has only conceded one from the first five balls.      8.11am    2nd over: England 16-0 (Buttler 4, Hales 12) That\u2019s two obstacles negotiated: the opening over from each of the New Zealand quicks. Southee doesn\u2019t produce his very best, giving Hales a shorter ball to shovel away via a pragmatic pull shot for four. Then taps two more to the other side of the pitch.      8.06am    1st over: England 9-0 (Buttler 3, Hales 6) Trent Boult to start off, the left-armer swinging the ball into the right-handed Buttler., who misses the first ball but clips the next for three along the ground to midwicket, saved by a sliding Mitchell. \u201cBest start by an England opener at the Gabba in the last 12 months,\u201d comes the dry aside from next to me. Hales gets some luck with an inside edge to fine leg for four. Follows up by using the full face, two runs through cover.   Updated at 8.24am GMT    8.00am    The anthems roll around the Gabba, still daylight over the ground as the teams line up in front of their flags.

England are often so good chasing, knowing what is ahead of them and mowing it down. But he says that with a used surface, they want to set a total. It may also have to do with avoiding Boult and Southee under lights, when swing may be more pronounced. So it will be Buttler and Hales to the middle in half an hour.   Updated at 8.07am GMT    7.42am   Preamble  Hello around the world from a very pleasant evening at the Gabba, as England\u2019s T20 World Cup hopes hang in the balance. Heavy rain this morning had some people worried, but in Brisbane the rain tends to pass through quickly, and the skies were clear and sunny by the afternoon. Sri Lanka and Afghanistan have just played out their match without trouble, and the two teams for the evening fixture are warming up in the late daylight.  New Zealand can lock in top spot with a win tonight, and the way they have been going, who would argue against them? If it isn\u2019t Finn Allen and Devon Conway making runs at the top of the order, it\u2019s Tim Southee and Trent Boult wrecking teams with the new ball.  England, meanwhile, staggered to a win over Afghanistan and lost to Ireland, while evading Australia thanks to a washout. They\u2019re an excellent team on paper while looking less convincing on grass in the last couple of weeks. Tonight is when they need to turn all that around. With a spot of paraphrasing, fearless cricket has been the mantra of the modern England white-ball team. They\u2019ll need some.   "

Bale has started two matches and made nine substitute appearances since moving to the US in June. He joined the Major League Soccer club after leaving Real Madrid. The 33-year-old forward\u2019s most recent appearance was as a 63rd-minute substitute in LAFC\u2019s 3-1 win against Houston on Monday.  The Wales captain arrived in Cardiff on Tuesday evening and trained on Wednesday morning with the squad. He continues to work to a tailored fitness programme and believes he is slowly building towards Wales\u2019s World Cup Group B opener against USA on 21 November in Qatar. \u201cI haven\u2019t played 90 minutes yet, which is what I\u2019m building up to,\u201d Bale said. \u201cWe\u2019re on a good path to where I want to be. I want to play 90 minutes as much as I can but I understand I need to build up to that because I haven\u2019t done it an awful lot in the last few years. \u201cThe most important thing for me is to take each week as it comes and hopefully that will be good enough for me to help LAFC and, ultimately, be ready for the World Cup. We have a plan in LA with what we\u2019re doing. We\u2019re not doing too much straight away. Every footballer wants to play as much as they can but we\u2019re being clever and building myself up for the last important part of the season. Hopefully, that should put me in great shape for the World Cup.\u201d The Wales manager, Rob Page, said he was \u201csurprised with how fresh\u201d Bale looked on arrival. The 18-year-old Birmingham midfielder Jordan James has received his first Wales senior call-up after Joe Allen and Ben Davies withdrew because of hamstring and knee injuries respectively. Wales play in Belgium on Thursday before hosting Poland on Sunday in Cardiff."

                    "body": "US soccer journalist Grant Wahl says he was detained by security staff after he wore a rainbow shirt to USA\u2019s World Cup opener against Wales. Wahl, who works for CBS Sports and writes a popular Substack column, wore the shirt as a show of solidarity with the LGBTQ+ community to the game at Qatar\u2019s Ahmad bin Ali Stadium. Homosexuality is illegal in Qatar.   However, he said a security guard told him the shirt was not allowed. Wahl said his phone was \u201cforcibly ripped\u201d from his hands by a guard as he tweeted about the incident. He said he was then detained for 25 minutes and told to remove his shirt, which a member of security staff said was \u201cpolitical\u201d. He was also asked if he was from the UK.  Wahl says he told a New York Times journalist who was passing by what had happened and he was detained too before being let go shortly afterwards. \u201cThen a security commander approached me,\u201d Wahl wrote in his Substack column. \u201cHe said they were letting me through and apologized. We shook hands. One of the security guards told me they were just trying to protect me from fans inside who could harm me for wearing the shirt \u2026 A Fifa rep later apologized to me as well. \u201cBut the entire episode left me wondering: What\u2019s it like for ordinary Qataris who might wear a rainbow shirt when the world isn\u2019t watching here? What\u2019s that like?\u201d Wahl said he was subsequently allowed to wear the shirt in the stadium.  A Wales LGBTQ+ supporters group said some of its members were forbidden from wearing rainbow hats at the same game.   Fifa has said everyone is welcome at this year\u2019s World Cup but LGBTQ+ rights activists and campaigners had earlier on Monday criticized soccer\u2019s world governing body after it threatened to impose sanctions on players who wear OneLove armbands at the tournament.  England, Wales and five other European nations have confirmed their players will not wear the armband, saying Fifa had made it clear their captains could be booked or forced to leave the pitch if they did so. Stonewall, the LGBTQ+ charity, said on Twitter: \u201cBy threatening sporting sanctions &amp; stopping players from wearing #OneLove armbands, Fifa are brushing criticism of human rights abuses under the carpet. \u201cLGBTQ+ people are criminalised in Qatar just for being themselves. No country which abuses the human rights of its people in this way should have been awarded with the honour of hosting a major sporting tournament in the first place. \u201cWe appreciate all the @England and @Cymru players\u2019 efforts to draw attention to the appalling human rights abuses of LGBTQ+ people in Qatar, and we urge them to continue to speak out in Qatar as best and safely as they can.\u201d"

                    "body": "Morocco\u2019s capital, Rabat, is more than 7,000km from Doha but that hasn\u2019t stopped the Atlas Lions from settling in. \u201cWe feel that we are home,\u201d their coach, Walid Regragui, said after their battling point against Croatia on Wednesday. \u201cAnd I am happy to be in Qatar. The Moroccan and Arab fans in the stands supported us and gave us strength when we felt tired.\u201d\nIt was a similar story 24 hours earlier after Tunisia also secured a 0-0 draw in their opening game against Denmark in front of a packed crowd dominated by their supporters. \u201cThe fan factor was very positive for us,\u201d said their coach, Jalel Kadri. \u201cIt mentally gave us a great lift and we are looking forward to seeing the fans continue to do that for us.\u201d\nSaudi Arabia, of course, had led the way in a historic victory against Argentina greeted by jubilant scenes in the stands and beyond. \u201cThe number of fans was large, but I hope it will be even larger,\u201d said manager Herv\u00e9 Renard of Saturday\u2019s meeting with Poland.\n\nOf all the trends in the first round of matches at the 2022 World Cup, the excellent start made by the Arab nations \u2013 Qatar aside \u2013 was the most eyecatching. Roared on by passionate supporters and playing in conditions many of the players are accustomed to, there has been a marked improvement in results in comparison with previous World Cups, especially Russia 2018. Saudi Arabia\u2019s 5-0 thrashing by the hosts in the opening match there set the tone, with Tunisia and Morocco losing to England and Iran respectively and failing to make it through the group stages.\nWhereas Renard can perhaps feel confident of matching Saudi Arabia\u2019s best World Cup performance, when they reached the last 16 in 1994, Regragui\u2019s and Kadri\u2019s sides still have it all to do after their stalemates \u2013 two of a record four 0-0 draws in the first round of matches.\nAt this rate, Qatar 2022 is on course to surpass the all-time high of seven goalless draws, which has occurred in four previous tournaments: 1982, 2006, 2010 and 2014. By contrast, none of the first 16 matches at Russia 2018 produced a goalless draw, with only one occurring during the tournament.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s been a boring World Cup by any means \u2013 there were 41 goals in the first round of matches at an average of 2.56 a game compared with 38 four years ago. Twenty-five of the goals in Qatar came in four matches.\nDeciphering trends at a World Cup can be confusing. How have the first 16 games in Qatar yielded no own goals when there were four in 2018 at the same stage, for example? The all-time high of nine own goals in Russia looks unlikely to be surpassed.\nThe absence of red cards during the first round of group matches in Qatar was the first time that no player has been dismissed since 1986, perhaps surprising given the introduction of VAR. Unfortunately for Wales\u2019s Wayne Hennessey, that clean sheet didn\u2019t last long. Meanwhile, there must be some explanation for why there were no goals from direct free kicks during the first round of matches.\n\nIt\u2019s fair to say some trends are more predictable, such as Uruguay\u2019s formidable defensive record at the World Cup. They have gone 465 minutes without conceding a goal in the group stages, since Wayne Rooney\u2019s equaliser for England 15 minutes from time in S\u00e3o Paulo in 2014. Uruguay\u2019s opening match with South Korea featured one shot on target, the lowest since 1986 when Denmark and Scotland registered one shot in their match.\nElsewhere, Andr\u00e9 Ayew\u2019s goal for Ghana against Portugal finally ended Africa\u2019s long wait for a goal in the first round of matches and Japan bucked a trend by recording their first comeback victory at the World Cup, against Germany at the ninth attempt, with the winning goalscorer, Takuma Asano, saying they had been inspired by Saudi Arabia\u2019s success. \u201cWe watched the Saudi game and thought we can do it \u2013 then we just did it today,\u201d he said."

                    "body": "Graham Arnold will sit down with Football Australia chiefs in early January to thrash out a new deal that is expected to see him remain in charge of the Socceroos, with the coach\u2019s bargaining power having received a fillip after he was named the best coach of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar. Highly regarded sports newspaper L\u2019Equipe put the out-of-contract Australian in top spot on its rankings, above the likes of Lionel Scaloni of Argentina and France\u2019s Didier Deschamps. Arnold\u2019s future is yet to be clarified after his deal expired following the Socceroos\u2019 barnstorming run to the last 16 of the tournament in Qatar, although he is expected to be offered a new contract once he returns from holiday in Europe in the new year.  In the meantime, he can bask in the glow of edging out Japan\u2019s Hajime Moriyasu at the summit of the French publication\u2019s rankings, which are based on individual match ratings throughout the tournament. Arnold averaged a score of 6.75 out of 10 after masterminding wins over Tunisia and Denmark as the Socceroos navigated out of Group D and into the last 16 for the second time in their history and for the first time since 2006. Defeats came against eventual winners Argentina in the knockout phase and runners-up France in their opening match of the tournament. The run earned an official 11th-place finish for the Socceroos and is expected to help Arnold\u2019s side rise to 27th in the world when the latest Fifa rankings are released on Thursday \u2013 their highest since reaching 25th in 2012 under Holger Osieck. The coach ratings, which are compiled by L\u2019Equipe journalists after each match, are based on a number of metrics, including tactical nous and how their teams played. Scaloni, having guided Argentina to the South Americans\u2019 third world title, ranked joint third alongside Walid Regragui, who took Morocco all the way to the semi-finals \u2013 the first time in history an African team had gone so far. France boss Deschamps came in fifth, with England\u2019s Gareth Southgate ranked sixth. L\u2019Equipe\u2019s player ratings are notoriously miserly, with just 14 perfect 10s having been awarded in their history. The first were given to Franck Sauz\u00e9e and Bruno Martini after a France U21s game in 1988 and the most recent to Erling Haaland for this season\u2019s Manchester derby hat-trick performance. Kylian Mbapp\u00e9, Lionel Messi (twice), Robert Lewandowski and Neymar also appear on the elite list. Aziz Behich was Australia\u2019s top performer in Qatar, according to L\u2019Equipe, with an average rating of 5.75 (by comparison, the Guardian gave Behich an average of 6.25) and golden boot winner Mbapp\u00e9 topped the list with a score of 7.17. Arnold headed to the UK straight from Qatar and is taking a break before returning to Australia in the new year for contract discussions. The Football Australia CEO, James Johnson, said on Wednesday he was in regular contact with the coach but no \u201chard conversations\u201d were being had at the moment. \u201cWe are midway through the post-World Cup campaign review,\u201d Johnson told Fox Sports. \u201cWe have signalled to Graham that we\u2019d like to have a conversation with him about the next four years. And he\u2019s signalled to us that he\u2019s open to having that conversation. \u201cHe\u2019s back from his holidays in early January and so too am I, and we\u2019ll sit down and have that conversation at that point in time.\u201d"

                    "body": "The ink was barely dry on Qatar\u2019s decision to ban alcohol from World Cup stadiums when an informed insider in Doha was asked why it was happening now, just 48 hours before the tournament\u2019s big kick-off. His response was succinct. \u201cIt\u2019s a deliberate fuck you to the west.\u201d\nOf course it was. Yes, the Qataris wanted to ensure that fans of every nation, religion and creed feel comfortable at matches \u2013 and that wouldn\u2019t be the case if some were boozed-up or blotto. And yes, Qatar remains a conservative Muslim country, in which alcohol is alien to the culture. But that was true on 2 December 2010, the day it won the right to host the World Cup, every bit as much as today.\nSo for it to rip up its promises and policy so late in the day should be seen for what it is: a show of strength and an almighty two fingers up to its critics.\n\nBut, as another well-connected football consultant put it, Friday\u2019s decision is part of a notable change in tack from the Qataris.\n\u201cFor years, they have appeared contrite and humble amid questions about their record,\u201d he said. \u201cBut now with the World Cup so imminent, their attitude has changed. The geopolitics around energy, and the west\u2019s increased need for gas during the war in Ukraine, makes them think they are immune. And if someone attacks them, they hit right back.\u201d\nTake LGBTQ+ rights. For years, western reporters and human rights groups have criticised Qatar\u2019s record. For years, itthe host country has stuck to giving vague assurances that everyone would be welcome. Then this month a Qatari World Cup ambassador, Khalid Salman, called homosexuality a \u201cdamage in the mind\u201d and warned gay fans they would \u201chave to accept our rules\u201d. That is some adjustment.\nMeanwhile when the Sunday Times suggested that Qatar had been using private investigators to target journalists, it didn\u2019t let it pass. Instead it threatened legal action \u201cto ensure those responsible are held to account\u201d.\n\nQatar also believes it has made significant progress on workers\u2019 rights and that this has been largely ignored by a western media who continue to focus on the negatives. That has furthered fuelled its anger and frustration.\nYet, in recent days, Qatar has also sent a more inflammatory message: that many criticisms of its human rights record are based on western racism, or a misplaced sense of western superiority.\nThat message is largely erroneous. And it is misplaced. But it is gathering force by the day.\nAs Qatar\u2019s labour minister, Ali bin Samikh al-Marri, put it this week: \u201cThey don\u2019t want to allow a small country, an Arab country, an Islamic country, to organise the World Cup.\u201d\nHe added: \u201cSome politicians and some media outlets in western countries have lost the moral and professional motive in their attack against Qatar.\u201d\nThat message has been echoed by local media. When a handful of people in the western press questioned whether India-born supporters of England, Brazil and Argentina might be \u201cfake fans\u201d, the Doha News quickly played the racism card.\nMeanwhile the state-run Qatar News Agency enthusiastically endorsed the official position, noting that: \u201cHis Excellency pointed out that the false slander campaign transgressed all limits in its attempt to discredit Qatar, the latest of which was the claim that the World Cup organisers used fake fans who receive money to attend the matches.\u201d\nWhat makes Qatar\u2019s behaviour more remarkable is that usually in the buildup to a World Cup, the Fifa show takes over. Rules are introduced to ensure things are done a certain way, and that brands such as Budweiser who are paying $75m (\u00a363m) are heavily promoted. Not here. Not now.\n\nInstead the Fifa president, Gianni Infantino, will spend Saturday morning answering searching questions about whether his organisation will face a massive lawsuit, which ensures the story will run for another 24 hours.\nBut this story isn\u2019t about whether beer should be sold at stadiums. In truth, if the Qataris had decided to ban it years ago, the issue would have long blown over. It is about shifting goalposts and worrying uncertainties.\nFor years it has talked about finding a middle ground between Qatar\u2019s conservative culture while doing its best to accommodate the 1.2 million expected visitors; an entirely reasonable position. But after this, how do we know that other assurances will not also be discarded over the next month? After all, if the Qataris are prepared to disregard the wishes of Fifa and its major sponsors, who could be next?Can LGBTQ+ fans really trust that they won\u2019t be censured for holding hands? Will England fans get in trouble for a minor cultural misunderstanding, despite Qatari claims they will take a patient and relaxed approach?\nAt least one thing has become clear. This World Cup will not only be played on Qatar\u2019s turf, but by its rules too."

                    "body": "Long before the end of a painful and humbling opening night for Qatar at this World Cup, many of the country\u2019s richest and most powerful men were speeding away from the Al Bayt stadium in their fast cars and 4x4s. They had, however, learned a valuable lesson. Money can buy you a lot of things in sport. Major events. Lavish stadiums. Impressive infrastructure. But it cannot guarantee a competitive national football team.\nThat harsh reality was dispensed in clinical style by an unheralded Ecuador side, who breezed to a 2-0 lead \u2013 thanks, in part to Qatar\u2019s erratic goalkeeper, Saad al-Sheeb \u2013 before taking their foot off the pedal. Not that many home fans were there to see it. Despite so much hype and expectation, along with a 12-year wait to watch their team in a home World Cup, thousands left at half-time.\nWe have regularly been told how deeply this World Cup matters to Qataris. Yet when it came to the crunch they could not disappear quick enough. Then again, having spent a reported $200bn to get their country ready for this event, more than every combined World Cup and Olympics in history, maybe they expected more from their team. Most of us did, in truth. Maybe the nerves and pressure were just too much.\n\nEarlier the omens had appeared promising. There was a lavish opening ceremony with sword-spinning dancers, camels and the South Korean K-pop star Jungkook, who sang the official anthem Dreamers. He was not the only one. The show was narrated by the actor Morgan Freeman, who promised: \u201cOn this journey, east and west will come together with one goal.\u201d The message was clear: Qatar and football could act as an emollient for a troubled and divided world.\nPerhaps it contained the thinnest sliver of truth. High above in the VVIP seats, Qatar\u2019s emir watched on, sitting beside Fifa\u2019s president, Gianni Infantino, and Saudi Arabia\u2019s ruler Mohammed bin Salman. Early last year, when the Saudis were part of a six-nation blockade of Qatar, few would have predicted that.\nOutside the stadium, meanwhile, thousands of ticketless fans had gathered to revel in the moment. And everywhere stereotypes were being smashed, not bottles. Traditional musicians played as kids and their parents danced and smiled. The first Arab and Muslim World Cup reverberated with possibilities.\nThere were no huge queues before kick-off nor a late rush to get in. But on the lush lawns of a perimeter park created in the desert 40km from Doha, thousands of ticketless locals gathered to be part of the moment and queue for a McDonalds.\n\nOne Doha resident, Shahid, who did not wish to share his full name, was looking after his children outside while their mother had got lucky with a ticket for the match. Shahid said he would go to 20 matches during the tournament, having created two Fifa accounts for the purpose. He said the majority of his friends had done the same.\nThe stage was set. The Al Bayt stadium looked spectacular, the pitch perfect. Meanwhile the gigantic air coolers on the side of each stand ensured the temperatures were perfect for players and fans.\nWhen the emir, who arrived by helipad before driving past an immaculate parade of soldiers on camels, turned up in the stadium there was loud applause. Before today a tournament host had never lost their opening World Cup match. But the writing was on the wall long before a double strike by the veteran striker Enner Valencia applied an efficient kill.\nAs the match sagged towards a predictable conclusion the Qataris who remained largely sat in silence, apart from a singing section in purple shirts \u2013 apparently brought in from Lebanon \u2013 behind the goal. By the end even their enthusiasm had waned. Could you blame them?\nThis, of course, has been billed by many as the most controversial World Cup ever, because of Qatar\u2019s human rights record. But, remember, the last one was staged in Russia. And the one before that in Brazil, which has since been shown to have been soaked in corruption.\n\nQatar continues to point out that it has made some notable changes \u2013 in particular laws to abolish the kafala system in 2020, which stopped migrants from changing jobs or leaving the country without their employer\u2019s permission, and introduce a minimum wage. Too many worrying gaps remain in the system, though.\nAnd watching this match, it was hard not to think about the thousands of migrant workers who have lost lives in the last 12 years. Meanwhile reform remains nonexistent when it comes to LGBTQ+ issues and partial regarding women\u2019s rights.\nThe tournament\u2019s opening game also served as an early stress test of how Qatar may cope with the expected influx of 1.2m foreign fans. The signs, it is fair to say, were mixed.\nFour hours before kick-off the cars on the main road into the stadium were barely moving, and there were some empty seats as the opening ceremony began. Meanwhile it was also reported that a group of more than 200 south Asian workers, hired to work on the food stalls at the match, had been without access to food, water or toilet facilities for seven hours.\n\nPerhaps these were early teething problems. The matches on Monday, especially England\u2019s intriguing Group B game against Iran, will provide a much more reliable guide.\nBut as the Al Bayt stadium emptied, one was reminded that the atmosphere was a far cry from the giddiness in the local papers hours earlier, with the Gulf Times promising that the\u201cBest ever Fifa World Cup kicks off in Qatar today\u201d and Al Arab hailed how \u201cQatar turns the Arab dream into reality\u201d.\nSo much for that. Repeatedly the Ecuador fans chanted \u201cqueremos cerveza\u201d \u2013 we want beer \u2013 in celebration. The Qataris, however, will have to find a different way to drown their sorrows.\nAdditional reporting by Paul MacInnes in Doha"

                    "body": "Perhaps, in a way, this had to happen eventually. Football\u2019s narrative arc demanded nothing less. The numbers simply made too little sense. Perhaps like Batman v Superman, Godzilla v Kong, the cronut, Manchester United and Qatar was simply a crossover concept begging to be brought into existence. Indulge me for a second. I\u2019m thinking pre-season tours to Doha. I\u2019m thinking an Mbapp\u00e9/Rashford reality TV job-swap. I\u2019m thinking luxury party barges on Manchester Ship Canal. A hologrammatic New Trafford to sit directly above the old one. A Phil Jones mural visible from space. And so to the news that Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani \u2013 a private Qatari individual with no direct connection to Qatar itself, unless you churlishly count the fact that he is its head of state \u2013 is interested in purchasing United. Or perhaps simply a stake in United rather than a full takeover. Or, according to which report you read, not necessarily Thani himself but a fund linked to the royal family, or perhaps the Qatar Investment Authority sovereign wealth fund.  This is pretty much all we know at this stage, which one suspects is exactly how the Qataris want it. Interested enough to test the water, to perform due diligence, to gauge the reaction from fans and the wider game; deniable enough that they can still pull out. One potential sticking point appears to be the valuation of between \u00a36bn and \u00a38bn being imposed by the Glazer family. Once you add investment to the squad and the exorbitant cost of redeveloping Old Trafford and Carrington, you\u2019re close to an 11-figure sum before you\u2019ve even landed in the country. In short: we are not talking another Paris here. It is easily forgotten amid the maelstrom that followed, but Qatar\u2019s initial investment in Paris Saint-Germain was minuscule by comparison: an initial 70% stake that valued the club at less than \u00a3100m. Financially speaking, it was a no-brainer. Paris was a failing club with a knockdown price, enormous potential, unfettered access to one of the richest markets in Europe, no close rivals and a medium-strength league that could easily be brought to heel. None of these advantages exists with United. For all the travails on the pitch, it remains one of the sport\u2019s most successful businesses: a paradigmatic example of how the modern sports club can lucratively leverage its brand and its advertising space without ever needing to trouble a trophy engraver. The Premier League will not simply be bought and bidden as Qatar did with Ligue 1, trapping it in an irresistible pincer movement of unmatchable transfer spending and beIN broadcast rights. If you\u2019re in charge of the sovereign wealth fund of an autocratic nation with a virtually limitless credit facility, you want cast-iron guarantees. Lumbered with an eye-watering price tag and surrounded by predators, United offer very few.  So what might Qatar want from United? Perhaps the same thing that it wanted from Harrods, from Heathrow airport and Sainsbury\u2019s, all of which it either owns or owns significant portions of: immediate identification with a cherished global brand, almost a stake in British society itself. Among cultural entities not even Liverpool or Arsenal can offer the same level of name recognition, the ability to print money simply by being who you are. And as Saudi Arabia discovered with Newcastle, buying a football club earns you an army of pliant bots desperate to do your bidding for you. Before the last World Cup, Qatar surreptitiously paid hundreds of football fans to promote the tournament for them online, rewarding them with free flights and tickets. It\u2019s a bit like that, really, but instead of free flights and tickets it\u2019s Jude Bellingham and Harry Kane. The really interesting question here, by contrast, is what United fans can possibly want out of Qatar. Spending money? If any club can offer a salutary lesson in the dangers of brainlessly flinging resources at the transfer market, then surely it is the club that has spent more than \u00a31bn in transfer fees in the past decade and won a grand total of zero league titles and reached zero Champions League semi-finals. The redevelopment of Old Trafford is long overdue, but anybody who visited the grotesque and soulless domes of Qatar\u2019s World Cup will testify that money can buy you a lot of things, but it doesn\u2019t buy you taste. There are no palatable options on the table here. There is no queue of ethical multibillionaires out there scrambling to claim a piece of one of the world\u2019s dirtiest sports. Nobody has ever accumulated the sums of money required to buy a football club of Manchester United\u2019s size without some form of widespread exploitation: exploitation of the planet, exploitation of human rights, exploitation of some of the world\u2019s poorest and least powerful people. Just because the Glazers were terrible, parasitic owners does not mean the next guys will be any better. But United fans have always liked to think of their club as an exemplar. As somehow more cherished and noble than any other. How stirring it would be if, as in 2005 when they furiously protested against the Glazer takeover, they chose to evoke that sense of exceptionalism for the greater good of the sport. To resist the prostitution of their club to one of the world\u2019s most savage governments. To demand better. The Glazers took hundreds of millions of pounds out of United. A Qatari takeover would take more still: something unique and elemental and important, something that it could never, ever replace."

                    "body": "It has been overlooked so far in the middle of so many other urgent issues, but the state of Qatar is currently facing a ticklish existential question. Here is another standard-issue jaw-dropping fact about this place. Climate scientists have estimated that by the year 2070 Qatar will no longer be fit for human habitation. Wait. What?\nLodged between two seas, deprived of greenery or waterways, Qatar is warming at an alarming rate. At the same time Qatar produces more carbon per citizen, for export and domestic use, than any nation on earth. Here is a place that is basically sitting on a pile of gold, while simultaneously gnawing its own legs off. The end of the world? It\u2019s on the check-list. The Supreme Committee is aware of your interest.\nThe answer, it seems, is to build new worlds. Welcome to Lusail, Lego-city of the gods, venue for Qatar\u2019s World Cup final three weeks from now, and surely one of the strangest places on earth.\n\nWalking around Doha there is a general sense of pastiche, of parody-castles conjured out of the air. Andy Warhol would love this place, would probably say something pithy about it, like all the realest things are fake-real, or real-fake. And Warhol would love Lusail most of all, a plastic city built for a hypothetical populace, $45bn (\u00a337bn) in the making, a kind of super-Croydon, as designed by the god of fire.\n\n\nA security guard at the Lusail Iconic Stadium.\n\nThis is a planned city, built wholesale from scratch, and coloured with a mimetic sense of humour. Lusail has a replica Place Vend\u00f4me. Lusail has a fake Beverly Hills (still under construction). There\u2019s a fake Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es, and a fake Rimini further down the way just past Entertainment Island, south of Entertainment City (opening date TBC).\nLook at it for long enough and Lusail also explains a couple things. First, why Qatar actually has the World Cup in the first place. And more to the point, why Qatar, for all its mind-boggling dictator-state modernity, should not be seen as a distinct and separate world. This is not an alternate universe. Come to sunny Lusail and find something that seems, in many ways, highly familiar. First, though, the future shock.\nWalking into town past the Iconic Stadium, venue for the World Cup final, you wind down Lusail Boulevard, pipeline to the heart of the city. In a World Cup week it is peopled by a trickle of awed tourists, a mix of Saudis, locals and football-shirted huddles, with a vague sense of some frontier adventure in train, astronauts discovering the Eiffel Tower on an alien beach.\n\nThe Boulevard is an amazing thing, a vast, gleaming causeway of perfect surfaces, electrified with sound and light, modelled on the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es, but the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es as reimagined by the members of Kraftwerk in a peyote trance.\n\n\n\n\n\nA family walk down the car-free Lusail Boulevard under flags of the competing nations of the World Cup; The packed boulevard before the Brazil v Serbia World Cup match; Screens with a message to upgrade your world on the Lusail Voulevard; The four towers at Al Sa\u2019ad Plaza can be seen from Lusail Boulevard.\n\nHere is a vast gloss-finish colonnade. Here are looming mirrored edifices on both sides. Giant golden pepper grinder towers rise at its end point, because, well, why not? Shiny motorised wild-west carriages wait for someone who wants to ride in a shiny motorised wild-west carriage. Here is an enormous pristine Chuck E Cheese, seductively lit but also empty and sealed, the only sign of life in an orderly row of rat traps.\nIt is a perfect city-scape, albeit one that after about 50 metres becomes pretty much unbearable, an overload of the senses. The piped music is inescapable. Vast scrolling screens carry Stalinist-scale Neymar watch adverts. And as you struggle on, lost in this urban TikTok world, something else keeps happening. Gusts of cold air surge from the pavement gulleys, freezing your ankles. Of course, of course. The municipal authority of Lusail is forcibly cooling the streets. This is how we, humanity, will fight climate change. Crank the dial. Let\u2019s air-condition the world.\nLate on Saturday morning a blaze will break out in one of the towers of Lusail, sending a cloud of black smoke above the skyline. The future, it seems, is on fire. But don\u2019t look up. Enjoy the high-spec present. As they say on the Qatar 2022 Supreme Delivery Committee: Now Is All.\nAnd later that evening, speeding along the marbleised esplanade towards the lights of Winter Wonderland, a machine voice can be heard emerging from some hidden grill. \u201cPlease go back. You are out of the approved zone. Please stay in the approved zone.\u201d It is a fair point well made. We are some way from the approved zone out here. Supercharged by Qatar\u2019s\u2019s despot-ball World Cup, a new world is being built. But for who?\n\n\n\n\n\nMotorboats parked next to the luxury restaurant Beefbar Qatar at the Lusail Esplanade with the ferris wheel of Winter Wonderland in the background; A worker painting in the midday sun at the entrance to the Lusail Winter Wonderland on the man-made island of Al Maha and a communications tower disguised as a palm tree near to the entrance; Some of the Winter Wonderland rides, including the Ice Slide.\n\nThe official version of Lusail is more prosaic and more reasonable. Qatar first announced the plans for this place in 2005, billing it as \u201ca sustainable lifestyle and community \u2026 a haven that is set to attract the world in the coming years\u201d. It is now close to being finished, arching all the way around what was once an empty bay, from The Iconic at one end down to the marina, the esplanade, the man-made islands, the distant Parisian domes.\nLusail is a place foreigners can buy (very expensive) Qatari real estate, most commonly on a 99-year lease. It will eventually host 450,000 people, 250,000 of them its privileged residents, the other 200,000 service people and workers. Lusail is building 36 new schools, a giraffe zoo, water parks and promenades, much of it designed around a mimesis of the old world, a post-modern Milton Keynes of the hyper-rich.\nIt is also beautiful, of course, and crammed with grandiose creative design. In the distance the outline of a vast metal whale shark sculpture floats above the boulevard, lashed on thin steel ropes. The giant shark in the sky is there to indicate (of course), Qatar\u2019s total commitment to preserving wildlife and ecology. It hovers, dream-like, lovely, menacing.\n\n\nA recently unveiled 30-metre art installation of a whale shark, called Al Nehem, suspended between the four Lusail Towers to show Qatar\u2019s concern about endangered species.\n\nAnd at the end of the boulevard are other walkways, other genres. At the end of the boulevard is, in fact, a surprisingly good Elvis impersonator, flanked by a peppy band and serenading a small crowd of street sweepers and tourists about the perils of stepping on his blue suede shoes. \u201cMmmmthangyverrymuch,\u201d Elvis says, then launches into a lavish, deliciously melodic version of It\u2019s Now Or Never, those fat sweet minor chords filling the empty air.\nFurther down there is a kind of ziggurat made from huge Rubik cubes and ringed by giant white swing pods. The heat by the water is soft, every surface bathed in red-blue light. Across the bay a mountainous roller coaster is being built. Crisp new football flags stand erect. A sculpted World Cup sign spells I Heart Qatar. Senses flushed, swooning a little, you feel the tug of the sweet, sweet, sports-washing.\nAcross the deserted bay Lusail Proper looms. There are cars here and people on the walkways, although most seem to be present to serve the people who don\u2019t yet exist. Bugsy Malone-style open-top stretch limos idle. Five basking policemen whistle at a lone jaywalker. The lampposts evolve into curlicued ironwork. And entering the Vend\u00f4me through vast sliding doors beneath golden fake stone buttresses, a transition takes place.\n\n\nBoats for hire at the lake inside the middle of the Place Vend\u00f4me shopping mall.\n\nInside this is just another entrance point to the global luxury shopping-verse. The halls are patrolled by squadrons of security men. The dancing fountains at its centre are ringed by fancy eateries. As the sun dips the lights fill this place with gold. It is frankly incroyable, habibi. A large sign on one wall reads There Can Only Be Beautiful Things to Look Forward To. An encouraging thought. But is it true?\nBecause this thing is also unnerving. There is wealth and life here, but also the sense of a sealed world, an arc in the desert on a planet of eight billion people. Lusail\u2019s public literature keeps using the word \u201csustainable\u201d, which is an interesting notion. And now I am become Death: builder of vast and decorative shopping malls.\nAnd yes, death does keep coming up around here. At Yacht Club tram station on the bay a sign reads \u201cFootball is a culture of peace and respect of human rights\u201d. Next to it is a 24-hour hotline number to Qatar\u2019s National Human Rights Committee. It is tempting go give it a call. \u201cHello? Is that the NHRC? I\u2019d like to report the unexplored deaths of up to 6,500 migrant workers\u2026 Er\u2026 Hello\u2026?\u201d\nQatar\u2019s World Cup development is an engineering miracle. But this is also a guilty miracle. As night creeps in along the lighted seafront, the loudest noises are the clanks and bangs from inside a darkened skeleton skyscraper. Is it falling down? No. This is the sound of people working, hammering this place of panels and precast blocs together, and with plenty of human waste along the way. The migrant workers haunt this place, ghosts at the feast, shadows on the edge of your vision at Qatar\u2019s gleaming stadiums.\n\n\nA sign displaying the rules and regulations at the Lusail promenade.\n\nVery few things have ever been built on this scale and at this speed without human suffering. The Fifa president, Gianni Infantino, would like us to ponder three thousand years (is this right?) of European colonialism before even considering unionised rights and working safety standards for people building a needless vanity project right here and right now.\nIt is a nonsensical line from a despot\u2019s glove puppet. Infantino spent his opening speech at this World Cup lambasting the power hungry elites in service of his own power hungry elite. His every public utterance is like having both ears violently syringed with a solution of walnut oil, amour propre and corporate lies.\nAnd yet, and yet, and yet, there is of course a kernel truth in Infantino\u2019s line of half-thought. There is a strong feeling at this World Cup, taking in the corruption at its source, the repressive laws of its host nation, the absurdity of its basic existence, of simply shouting and pointing at something opaque. And just as Lusail may be startling , as it is intended to be, the othering of Qatar is to be resisted. In fact, look closely and there is a kind of clarity in its more extreme notes.\n\n\nLocals walk past a painted facade made to look like old houses, erected to hide building works going on behind, in the background the Katara Towers on the seafront in Lusail which houses two luxury hotels, where many Fifa officials are staying.\n\nFor one thing it is hard not to be wowed by this new build city, to like it. Someone has to make something new. Why not this? And new things are always strange. There is also the fact the frantic development of Lusail and indeed this World Cup is born out of security threats. This play-place for the global rich is also a form of ballast against regional power grabs. Qatar was until recently a very small spot on the map, keeper of the world\u2019s third largest energy reserves.\n\nFootball, sport, investment, the building of Lusail. This is all about connecting to the world, not so much to be liked, as to be respected, to be a player. Fifa is now on site. Qatar has ultimate visibility.\nAnd beyond that Qatar is not, when you look more widely, some kind of rogue state peopled by a different kind of human being. In fact, the best way to look at it is perhaps as a very literal-minded and efficient expression of the forces at work across every other modern state. Qatar just does it wilder, harder and without apology. It is a reductio ad absurdum of the idea of supremely wealthy overlords, of the surveillance state, of an underclass of workers, of increasingly repressive laws, of the global carbon addiction. Do any of these sound familiar? In many ways Qatar is like your furiously able and efficient younger colleague; who has essentially looked at this, learnt the mannerisms, and said, yeah, we can do that.\n\n\nthe floating pitch on the sea that was put there for FIFA to play on when they get bored in their luxury hotel inside Katara Towers.\n\nSo Qatar builds its Venice and its Paris on the fly, crams a hundred years of growth into a decade, without the cultural flora and fauna to hide its workings. Here it is doing the same thing with the World Cup. OK, we can have one of those. It\u2019s going to be massive. Just like yours. This is the message of Lusail, and of the vast and echoey Iconic Stadium, a kind of warning from the future. Welcome to Winter Wonderland.\nAt the end of the bay the lights melt into the sea. Enormous shiny cars crawl along the double lane highway and turn back. This part of town is not empty. There is an industry of the World Cup here, some early settlers, native joggers, tourists luxuriating in the dreamy glaze of this waterfront Narnia. As the land ends past the Wonderland the scooter motor clicks off, extended beyond its range. Please go back. You are out of the zone."

                    "body": "Pep Guardiola has confirmed Kyle Walker will not play for Manchester City before the World Cup and that Kalvin Phillips has only an outside chance of doing so, but said each was optimistic of being fit for England should Gareth Southgate name them in his 26-man squad. Walker has been out with a groin problem since 2 October, and Phillips\u2019s shoulder injury was sustained on 14 September. Southgate considers them automatic choices when fit and with Chelsea\u2019s Reece James, another of his preferred right-backs, out until after the group stage, the manager faces a dilemma regarding how many players not 100% he can take to Qatar.  Guardiola said of Walker, who can play in central defence as well as at right-back, and Phillips, a midfielder: \u201cThey are better, I think they are getting better, Kalvin especially, but they are out. Until after the World Cup, they will not be ready [for City].\u201d The manager was then brighter regarding Phillips. \u201cHe said he feels really well,\u201d Guardiola said. \u201cHis mobility in the shoulder is perfect. He\u2019s started to train in contact with the ball. He has to avoid contact with teammates but he\u2019s really well. We\u2019re surprised at how quick his development [has been]. \u201cIf he\u2019s fit then I believe he can play [at the World Cup]. If he\u2019s ready he can maybe take minutes [for City before] but I don\u2019t know right now. We\u2019ll see.\u201d Southgate is due to name his squad on 10 November, two days before City\u2019s final pre-World Cup fixture. Guardiola, asked about Phillips\u2019s and Walker\u2019s mood, said: \u201cThey are in a positive way, they are optimistic, they are ready. I think they are in touch with Gareth. The managers of the national team, maybe they have more info. Hopefully they can get it and be ready to be selected at the end. It\u2019s a question for the national team.\u201d Erling Haaland was replaced at half-time of Tuesday\u2019s draw at Borussia Dortmund after feeling unwell. Regarding the striker\u2019s availability for Saturday\u2019s trip to Leicester, Guardiola said: \u201cHe feels better but we have training this [Friday] afternoon. We will assess in a few hours. We will see how he is feeling, if he is fit.\u201d Guardiola\u2019s contract expires next summer. In the close season he stated discussions may occur during the break for the World Cup. Asked on Friday whether this was on the agenda, he said: \u201cNot yet.\u201d Guardiola believes Manchester United are serious title contenders again. \u201cI have a feeling that United is coming. Finally, United is coming. I saw yesterday [against Sheriff] and Chelsea [last Sunday] the first half. I thought: \u2018I like it, what I see from United just now\u2019.\u201d"

                    "body": "James Maddison is expected to miss England\u2019s opening game at the World Cup with a slight knee problem that kept him out of training again yesterday. The Leicester midfielder, a surprise inclusion in Gareth Southgate\u2019s squad, has been struggling since limping off during his side\u2019s victory over West Ham last weekend. Maddison has not trained properly since Wednesday and is unlikely to be involved when England face Iran in Group B on Monday.\nThe 25-year-old\u2019s potential absence is a blow for England. Maddison was never likely to start at the Khalifa International Stadium but he would be a useful option off the bench. The injury is not believed to be serious and there is confidence that he will be available when England face Wales and the USA.\n\nThe likely absence of Maddison will enhance the prospects of Conor Gallagher featuring in some role and the midfielder is confident his energetic style will give him a chance of making a positive impact in the Qatari heat. Gallagher was not called up for England\u2019s Nations League games in September and did not expect to be on the plane after struggling to nail down a regular starting role at Chelsea. The 22-year-old had taken the bold decision to return to his boyhood club after impressing on loan at Crystal Palace last season and it seemed his international hopes were under threat when he was sent off for two bookings during the first half of Chelsea\u2019s win over Leicester in August.\nThere was a feeling that Gallagher, who has started eight games this season, would have been better served by returning to Palace. Eyebrows were raised when the Chelsea academy graduate edged Southampton\u2019s James Ward-Prowse out of Gareth Southgate\u2019s 26-man squad for Qatar.\n\u201cTo be honest, I didn\u2019t expect it,\u201d Gallagher said. \u201cI was a little bit surprised., \u201cI\u2019ve not played consistent football with Chelsea and as a team Chelsea have not played great this season \u2013 we\u2019ve definitely got a lot to improve and I am sure we will.\n But I am very grateful and honoured that the England manager has belief in me and saw what I can do when I\u2019ve played for Chelsea this season and, obviously, last season as well. It\u2019s football. The road is never just going to go up. There\u2019s always bumps in the road. It\u2019s just about keeping believing in myself.\u201d\n\nSouthgate has explained that Gallagher, who has four caps, can give England something different. He offers a goalscoring threat from midfield and could be a useful option off the bench when England play Iran. The stadiums are air-conditioned but kicking off at 4pm could still be challenging for Southgate\u2019s players.\n\u201cI feel like I can bring energy going forward and defensively as well,\u201d Gallagher said. \u201cIn whatever position the manager players me, I will do my best to be as effective as I can on the pitch. Whether that\u2019s to score goals or try to win the ball back then that\u2019s what I can do.\u201d\nEngland ramped up their preparations by training again in scorching conditions on Friday. They took to the field at their Al-Wakrah Sports Club base at 12.30pm local time for the second consecutive day, with the temperature at 33C.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a big difference from the cold, wet weather at home but I feel that we have adapted well,\u201d Gallagher said. \u201cWhen that first game comes we will be raring to go, no matter what the temperatures are.\u201d\nThomas Tuchel, Chelsea\u2019s former head coach, has previously compared Gallagher to N\u2019Golo Kant\u00e9. \u201cWhen he said it, it did make me laugh and surprise me a little bit,\u201d Gallagher said. \u201cIt\u2019s obviously a massive compliment, even if I\u2019m half the player Kant\u00e9 is because I feel like he\u2019s the best midfielder in the world. We are obviously different players. He probably gets around a bit more than me. He\u2019s a bit sharper than me.\u201d\nDespite the modesty it is clear that Southgate values Gallagher. The 22-year-old has done well when given opportunities by Graham Potter, who replaced Tuchel in September. He scored his first goal for Chelsea in October and impressed Southgate by accepting a call-up to the Under-21s when not involved in England\u2019s Nations League camp. \u201cIf I didn\u2019t do my job properly and go and play with the 21s then I probably would not be here now,\u201d Gallagher said."

                    "body": "Thiago Silva is acutely aware of what is to come. The World Cup is the ultimate obsession for every Brazil player but for a senior figure like him, somebody with so much history, the man who is expected to wear the captain\u2019s armband in Qatar, the intensity is ratcheted up even further. It is no exaggeration to say that Silva has felt the countdown to the finals, which will get under way on 20 November, since his nation was knocked out of the 2018 tournament by Belgium in that epic quarter-final. It has certainly been the case since he joined Chelsea in the summer of 2020, the sense at the club pretty clear that everything has been building to this point for him. The Chelsea manager, Graham Potter, is not kidding himself. \u201cEveryone has got half an eye on the World Cup,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019d be fooling ourselves if we didn\u2019t think that was the case, no matter what country. But it\u2019ll be his fourth one for Brazil so there\u2019s a half an eye, definitely.\u201d And yet one of the things that elevates Silva is his ability to compartmentalise, to retain that aura of control. It was stamped across his performance in Wednesday\u2019s 3-0 Champions League win at Stamford Bridge over his former club Milan \u2013 a display that had the home crowd purring, jumping out of their seats and singing his name.  Potter has a decision to make on Silva for Saturday\u2019s home game with Wolves, even though he will be without another of his central defenders, Wesley Fofana. Silva played the 90 minutes of last Saturday\u2019s 2-1 win at Crystal Palace and he came through the full match on Wednesday, too. At 38, he surely needs a breather here and there. Potter has ruled out Fofana for a \u201cfew weeks\u201d after the Frenchman damaged a knee against Milan. But if Silva plays, there would be no Chelsea fan who did not expect to see that trademark icy smoothness, which stands to be more pronounced against the fire of Diego Costa. The former Chelsea striker hopes to feature after his free agent move back to the Premier League last month. Silva against Milan was broadly in keeping with what he has produced this season and there were a couple of moments defensively that not only energised his team but seemed to deflate the visitors. First, the tackle on Rafael Le\u00e3o in the 19th minute with the score 0-0 and Chelsea still to ignite. Le\u00e3o was Milan\u2019s dangerman, an explosive presence, but Silva snapped in to defuse him with impeccable timing. Then, before half-time, as Rade Krunic looked to release Olivier Giroud, there was Silva stretching to intercept.  Between times he popped up at the other end to threaten on set pieces, helping to force the breakthrough goal for Fofana with a powerful header. At full-time, Silva made a bowing gesture in front of the Matthew Harding Stand as he took the acclaim of the support. \u201cHe was outstanding,\u201d Potter said. \u201cHe\u2019s 38 years old, 38 years young and, when he\u2019s playing like that, he\u2019s an impressive person. He\u2019s a character, a proper guy, who\u2019s got a fantastic experience but has a humility to just do the job.\u201d If it is half about what is around the corner for Silva, Potter made the point that it was all about what was most immediate \u2013 in other words, the preparation for Wolves. \u201cHe\u2019s competing in the Champions League and the Premier League \u2013 you don\u2019t get that by thinking about something that\u2019s six weeks away,\u201d Potter said. \u201cYou get it by being in the moment. It\u2019s how he prepares, recovers, rests and focuses. It\u2019s why he\u2019s so good and why he is going to play in the World Cup.\u201d Silva was an unused squad member at the finals in 2010 but, four years later when Brazil hosted, he was the captain and there were times when he seemed overwhelmed by the emotion \u2013 most notoriously when he sat alone after the last-16 tie against Chile had finished 1-1 and, with penalties looming, sobbed his heart out.  Silva, who was suspended for the 7-1 semi-final humbling against Germany, lost the captaincy to Neymar after the World Cup and Tite, who took over from Dunga in 2016, has passed the armband around, rotating it among his key players at the 2018 tournament. It is an approach he could continue in Qatar. That said, Silva is regarded as the regular captain \u2013 more than Casemiro and Marquinhos, although it will be interesting to see what happens if Tite names Dani Alves in his squad. Silva was the captain at the 2021 Copa Am\u00e9rica and he has worn the armband in 15 of his past 18 starts. Either way, Silva \u2013 with 108 caps \u2013 is a leader and the pressure will come for him. How is he wearing it at present? \u201cWith responsibility, pride and respect,\u201d Potter said. \u201cAll the things you\u2019d expect because he\u2019s so professional. That\u2019s the impressive thing. It gives him a chance to be in the games now and be ready for the World Cup.\u201d Potter revealed that the Chelsea co-owner Todd Boehly had watched training on Friday and the pair had a catch-up chat in the afternoon. The club are close to appointing Christopher Vivell, who has been sacked by RB Leipzig, as their technical director. There was a time when the presence of the owner on the touchline at Cobham would have been a major news story. Not now. This is a new era. Silva remains a constant."

To say that it did not work out for the 22-year-old midfielder on an individual level is an understatement. Each and every detail went against him, the big ones, the small ones and even those over which he had no control.\nIt is a large part of the reason why Foden readily admits that England are yet to see the best of him. \u201cDefinitely not,\u201d he says, after training in the searing heat of Qatar on Thursday lunchtime before England\u2019s World Cup opener against Iran on Monday.\nOr why Foden does not remotely consider himself world-class despite the trophies he has won and the profile he has built since breaking through at Manchester City. \u201cDefinitely not,\u201d he says again. The numbers are not good \u2013 two goals in 18 caps, the first of which he won in Iceland in September 2020, and the less said about that trip the better.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it is easy coming into a team and not knowing the players very well,\u201d Foden says. \u201cYou have to learn what they like best \u2013 running behind or wanting balls to feet. [But] I have had enough experience in the England team to understand the players. I should have scored a lot more for England. I am hoping that this World Cup can be good for me and hopefully I can bring goals.\u201d\nFoden enters with confidence and perhaps it is because he is the only member of the squad who knows what it is like to have won a World Cup. He triumphed in the Under-17 edition in 2017, when he was named player of the tournament. Have his teammates picked his brains over that? \u201cI don\u2019t think they realise,\u201d Foden replies with a smile. \u201cI\u2019m going to have to tell them that I\u2019ve already won the World Cup, aren\u2019t I? It changed some of our lives forever.\n\u201cI do remember strongly the team just being so confident. Not being big-headed but we just knew that we were going to win because of how good we were. It\u2019s the same here with this squad. Making it to the final of the Euros gives the team a big lift. I think Harry [Kane] has already touched on it. He sees us as one of the favourites. We\u2019ve just got to be confident and believe in that.\u201d\n\nFoden\u2019s Euros might have taken a different course had an early shot in the opening game against Croatia gone in rather than come back off a post. \u201cIt could have turned my tournament around,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen you score, your confidence goes through the roof and you feel like you can do anything.\u201d\nInstead it lurched the other way after he picked up a booking for a needless 64th-minute foul on the Croatia defender Josko Gvardiol. The consequences would be extreme, out of all proportion to the offence. When Mason Mount was ruled out of the final group game against the Czech Republic and the last-16 tie against Germany, having been a close contact of Scotland\u2019s Covid-positive Billy Gilmour, Gareth Southgate removed Foden from the lineup that took on the Czechs.\nThe manager did not want Foden to collect a second yellow card and a suspension against Germany. In came Bukayo Saka, who excelled, and Foden would feature again only as an extra-time substitute in the semi-final win over Denmark. He would miss the final after suffering a serious foot injury in training. The session had ended and it sounded as if Foden was messing around.\n\u201cI was doing a bit of long passing after training and I decided to do some kind of touch and I felt something in my foot,\u201d he says. \u201cI couldn\u2019t walk. It was quite bad and they said to me it was an injury you do not see very often. To sit out the final \u2013 probably one of the biggest games of my life \u2013 was really difficult.\u201d\nFoden, who has been in and out of the City team since the beginning of October, wants to transfer his club scoring form to the World Cup. He has eight goals for City this season, putting him on course to break his career high of 16 in 2020-21, and he believes he is getting into better areas, mainly from wide starting positions. In previous seasons, he played as a false 9, at times. There is no need for that now Erling Haaland has joined.\nWhat is Foden\u2019s best role? There is the sense that Southgate has not quite found it, although he has seemingly tried him everywhere, including as a deep-sitting playmaker and up front alongside Kane. \u201cI see myself playing behind the striker in the future or as one of the 8s or 10s at City,\u201d Foden says. \u201cYou can influence the game more centrally because sometimes you are standing out wide \u2026\u201d\nFoden is fiercely motivated to step up at the World Cup but there is one pre-tournament difference \u2013 there is no peroxide rinse. \u201cIt was unbelievable to see everyone doing it [at the Euros],\u201d Foden says. \u201cMy phone was daily going off with: \u2018This kid\u2019s got the haircut!\u2019 It was surreal. I am just going to stick with what I have got this time round unfortunately.\u201d"

My colleague Imogen Dewey kicked us off last week and has passed the baton my way for this second instalment. In the first full week of summer it\u2019s little surprise that music, sport and health are top of mind. While I\u2019ve got your attention, subscribe to our weekday Morning Mail newsletter for the lowdown on what happened while you slept, and Afternoon Update to get you up to speed on the commute. For now, here\u2019s some fine writing to get the weekend juices flowing. 1. Is Facebook losing its US$100bn metaverse gamble?  Facebook\u2019s founder, Mark Zuckerberg, is increasingly spending his time trying to perfect his vision of the virtual reality future. Out in the real world, the future of the social media behemoth is suddenly looking shaky: the parent company Meta has laid off 13% of the workforce and investors have made for the exits, wiping US$80bn off its valuation in the process. Virtual reality competitors such as VRChat and Rec Room are thriving. At Meta HQ, employees are wondering whether Zuckerberg\u2019s vanity project will kill the company. By the numbers: Reality Labs, Meta\u2019s metaverse division, has lost US$3.7bn in the past three months. Worse is expected to come. How long will it take to read? Five minutes. 2. A \u2018deeply uncomfortable\u2019 World Cup experience Guardian Australia\u2019s deputy sport editor, Emma Kemp, has just returned from Qatar, where she had a front-row seat to the Socceroos taking it to the world\u2019s best. \u201cThe pre-tournament stream of news and commentary about what was happening off the pitch slowed as journalists shifted their focus to the football,\u201d she writes. And although she enjoyed herself, the \u201cgrotesque pang of privilege\u201d was never far from the surface. Notable quote: \u201cYou can try to bridge the gap all you like, by chatting and joking and humanising the person who has just served you something from a fridge you could have opened yourself. Truthfully, though, that process only helps you \u2013 the workers themselves will still be there, standing sentry at their station like servants inside a mansion of disproportionate wealth.\u201d How long will it take to read? Five minutes. Further reading: Aaron Timms tears strips off the \u201cunmissable abomination\u201d that is the US Fox Sports\u2019 World Cup coverage.

The price of \u2018sugar free\u2019 Even if you\u2019re not seeking out artificial sweeteners, the chances are you\u2019re consuming them. Researchers in Hong Kong have detected them not just in sugarless chewing gum, but also in salad dressings, bread and instant noodles. As the world scrambles to cut down on sugar, Bee Wilson\u2019s long read asks: are sweeteners as harmless as we thought? Key takeaway: Every expert Wilson spoke to said the best answer for our health would be for people to get used to a less sweet diet. \u201cBut sweeteners are no easy thing to give up,\u201d she writes. How long will it take to read? Ten minutes. 4. \u2018My boyfriend, a writer, broke up with me because I\u2019m a writer\u2019  To go into too much detail about Isabel Kaplan\u2019s account of a messy relationship breakup would spoil the surprise. Suffice to say, it was the talk of the newsroom, generating highly polarised views. Why the Nora Ephron photo above? Take it away, Isabel. \u201cWhen I found myself sad and lonely in the Upper West Side apartment of my now-ex-boyfriend\u2019s dreams, I turned to Nora Ephron. I hunted through her body of work searching for clues, trying to understand who and what my ex-boyfriend loved and feared.\u201d How long will it take to read? Three minutes. 5. Wrapped in stats A clinical dissection of who you are as a person or a cynical marketing exercise? #SpotifyWrapped dominates Twitter and Instagram for 24 hours each year as tastemakers and punters share their most-played music of the past 11 months, even if in my case that does lead off with Kanye West thanks to a post-doco, pre-antisemitism discography binge. But I digress \u2026 Where exactly your music taste comes from is a matter too complex even for the Spotify algorithm. Katie Hawthorne speaks to two authors with alternative takes: one romantic, the other more scientific. \u201cAlthough streaming services might surreptitiously curate our listening experiences,\u201d Hawthorne writes, \u201cSpotify can\u2019t account for the songs that get stuck in our heads.\u201d Fun fact: Those genres you\u2019re assigned to, like Escape Room or Float House? They\u2019re coined by software engineers who spot listeners congregating around sounds and title the groups accordingly. How long will it take to read? Four minutes.

The US men are guaranteed $13m in prize money for reaching the last 16 in Qatar. That will be shared equally between the men\u2019s and women\u2019s teams under the equal pay agreement struck between US Soccer and the USWNT Players\u2019 Association earlier this year (10% of the money will go to the US Soccer Federation). For context, the $6.5m coming to the women\u2019s team is more than they won in total for their last two World Cup victories. The USWNT earned $4m for winning the 2019 World Cup and $2m for their title in 2015.  The prize money for the 2023 Women\u2019s World Cup has not yet been set, although Fifa president Gianni Infantino has said he wants to \u201cat least double\u201d the pot from 2019. However, even if the prize money doubles to $60m, it would still be dwarfed by the $440m handed out to men\u2019s teams in Qatar. Under this year\u2019s agreement the US men will get 50% of the US women\u2019s prize money in 2023. World Cup prize money was not the only area where equal deals were reached in the US teams\u2019 agreement, which was ratified in May and formally signed in September. Shares of ticket sales will now be equal, as will win bonuses. Some aspects of income and benefits will differ between the teams. The men did not share their $2.5m bonus for qualifying for this year\u2019s World Cup as it was part of the their previous CBA. Walker Zimmerman, who is part of the US squad in Qatar and a member of the US men\u2019s players\u2019 union, said in May that he was happy with the deal. \u201cThere are tough conversations, but at the end of the day, it is the right thing to do,\u201d Zimmerman said. \u201cIt\u2019s something that [the US women\u2019s team players] deserve. It\u2019s something that they have fought for so hard, and, to be honest, sometimes it does feel like we had just kind of come alongside of them and had been a little late.\u201d Becky Sauerbrunn, the USWNT players\u2019 association president, said in May that the agreement would ensure success for the team in the future. \u201cWe hope that this agreement and its historic achievements in not only providing for equal pay but also in improving the training and playing environment for national team players will similarly serve as the foundation for continued growth of women\u2019s soccer both in the United States and abroad.\u201d The US women\u2019s team has long fought for equal treatment with the men\u2019s team. In December 2020 they reached an agreement with US Soccer over equal work conditions with their male counterparts. The players were granted the same conditions as the US men\u2019s team in areas such as travel, hotel accommodation, the right to play on grass rather than artificial turf, and staffing. Then, in February, the team agreed a $24m settlement that ended a six-year legal battle over equal pay. The teams will be guaranteed $17m if the US beat the Netherlands on Saturday to reach the quarter-finals. In the unlikely event the US win the title in Qatar they will earn $42m. They US women shouldn\u2019t hold their breath though \u2013 their male counterparts are 90-1 with most bookmakers to lift the trophy."

                    "body": "Qatar\u2019s longest-lasting legacy following the World Cup won\u2019t be football or even its human rights record \u2013 it will be the climate crisis, according to a new report warning that its huge expansion of gas extraction could push the planet into catastrophic global heating. Should Qatar exploit all of its oil and gas reserves it will eventually add an enormous 50bn metric tons of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere once burned, which is more than the entire annual emissions of the whole world, the new research, shared with the Guardian, has found. This vast output of emissions will in itself push the world beyond the internationally agreed limit of 1.5C of global heating beyond industrial times, beyond which scientists warn there will be increasingly disastrous impacts from heatwaves, droughts, floods and biodiversity die-offs. QatarEnergy, the state-owned petroleum operation that is overseeing a huge escalation in the country\u2019s oil and gas output, is a sponsor of the World Cup currently under way in Qatar. Fifa, which has been accused of falsely claiming the World Cup will be carbon neutral, has featured QatarEnergy in sponsorship slots in stadiums and online even as the global football body launched a campaign called #SavethePlanet in which it warned the climate crisis \u201cthreatens the essential ingredients of good health\u201d and causes \u201cincreasing destructiveness of extreme weather events\u201d. Qatar\u2019s vast oil and gas resources have greatly enriched the small Middle Eastern country, which this year became the world\u2019s largest exporter of liquified natural gas (or LNG), superseding the US and Australia. It is now looking to further cement its position by ramping up production from a vast offshore gas deposit called the north field, which will account for 70% of the emissions growth according to the new report by BankTrack, an NGO that used data from BP to ascertain the extent of Qatar\u2019s \u201ccarbon bomb\u201d projects. The emissions from Qatar\u2019s oil and gas resources will cause $20tn in damages and 11m deaths around the world, BankTrack said, citing calculations based upon recent research looking at the economic and mortal cost of fossil fuels. QatarEnergy has signed recent partnership deals with western oil giants including Shell, Total, ConocoPhilips, Exxon and Eni in order to boost output of the north field by 60% over the next five years. Separate deals have been struck in the past month with Germany and China to provide the countries with gas amid concerns over supplies disrupted by Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. Saad Sherida al-Kaabi, Qatar\u2019s energy minister and chief executive of QatarEnergy, said last month Qatar will \u201cprovide reliable and credible LNG supply solutions to customers across the globe\u201d. No new fossil fuel infrastructure can be built if the world is to avoid breaching the 1.5C limit, the International Energy Agency has warned, but despite this there has been plenty of financial support for Qatar\u2019s gas expansion. JPMorgan Chase, Citi, HSBC, Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs, MUFG, Credit Suisse and Bank of America have all backed planned projects in the north field, providing nearly $12bn in bond underwriting services to QatarEnergy. \u201cThere\u2019s a massive amount of emissions about to come from oil and gas taken from Qatar, although there hasn\u2019t been much attention to it until now,\u201d said Henrieke Butijn, climate campaigner and researcher at BankTrack. \u201cWhat\u2019s happening in Qatar is awful in terms of these projects and also worker conditions, but there is a level of hypocrisy here because Qatar isn\u2019t acting alone. \u201cFifa selected Qatar for the World Cup and chose QatarEnergy as one of the main sponsors, even while they push their own climate campaign. And banks which have made net zero emissions commitments all know what they are doing when they are underwriting QatarEnergy. These banks need to cut off any finance that isn\u2019t aligned with the 1.5C goal.\u201d At the recent UN Cop27 climate summit in Egypt, the world\u2019s governments again committed to keeping below 1.5C, although emissions reduction pledges currently fall drastically short of meeting this target. While wind and solar energy deployment is growing rapidly \u2013 clean energy is set to overtake coal as an energy source globally by 2025 \u2013 the world is still teeing up vast quantities of fossil fuels that would push societies into climate meltdown should they be burned. A huge 3.5tn tons of greenhouse gas emissions will be emitted if governments allow identified reserves of coal, oil and gas to be extracted and used, a recent released in September found. Qatar\u2019s 50bn tons of emissions will occur if it allows all of its deposits to be burned. While this may not happen if other countries move decisively away from fossil fuels as an energy source, there is currently no commitment from Qatar that it won\u2019t completely exhaust its reserves. In previous years there have been claims Qatar\u2019s gas reserves could last more than 130 years. QatarEnergy was contacted for comment on the research. On its website, the state-owned body states that the climate crisis is \u201cone of the most critical issues of our times\u200b and requires prompt and dedicated action at a global scale\u201d. \u201cFossil fuels are weapons of mass destruction, carbon bombs ticking against the time we have left to avert the very worst of the climate crisis,\u201d said Harjeet Singh, head of global political strategy at Climate Action Network International. \u201cFossil fuel companies, the banks that fund them and the governments that support them are complicit in the suffering of millions. It is time to strip them off their social and economic licenses and make them pay up for climate damages.\u201d"

                    "body": "A man requiring a wheelchair claims he was booted from his Qatar Airways flight after boarding the plane and left stranded at Melbourne airport because of his disability. The story of Craig Nolan, an Australian man with spina bifida whose plan to return to his home in Finland via Doha was disrupted, comes after the disability royal commission heard evidence in recent weeks that airlines are \u201cdehumanising\u201d Australians with disabilities, who they treat as an \u201cafterthought\u201d. On Monday, Nolan arrived at Tullamarine airport for his flight to Doha, having already alerted the airline to his disability and the fact he would be travelling solo \u2013 something the well-travelled 43-year-old has grown used to doing.  Nolan had been in Australia for several months, having returned in September for a family funeral. Nolan said he was made to check in his wheelchair and transferred to an aisle seat \u2013 a narrow chair that requires another person to push it that some airlines use to take passengers to their seat on a plane. This involved ground staff lifting him up over a roughly large step from the airbridge onto the plane. However, before the flight took off, Nolan said he told one of the cabin crew he would need assistance to reach the in-cabin bathroom, because he needed someone to push his aisle chair there. Soon after, he said another member of the cabin crew told Nolan he had to leave the flight. Nolan was stranded at the airport, with Melbourne airport putting him up in a hotel initially. He has since tried to apply for a refund on his flight ticket, and said Qatar Airways was going to deduct about $400 from the refund because he was listed as a \u201cno show\u201d in their system.  Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup  Nolan told the Guardian he believes he was removed from the flight due to a misunderstanding \u2013 that the cabin crew wrongly assumed he would need assistance throughout the flight including when in the bathroom. \u201cHad they listened they would have realised I only needed help to be pushed from my chair to the toilet, which is part of their job description. I wasn\u2019t asking for help in the plane or in the bathroom,\u201d Nolan said. Nolan, who runs a translation company and a disability auditing company with his partner in Finland, said he had been made to fly in aisle seats numerous times when travelling by himself internationally but had never encountered a similar misunderstanding. He said he was particularly frustrated at the thought the incident could have been avoided had Qatar Airways\u2019 crew asked him directly. Guardian Australia has contacted Qatar Airways, but a spokesperson did not respond by deadline. Nolan\u2019s experience comes after the disability royal commission heard evidence that people with disabilities are routinely subject to violence, abuse, neglect and exploitation when flying domestically through Australian airports. In workshops with more than 60 Australians with a disability held in recent weeks, the commission heard that participants frequently faced extended and unreasonable wait-times when checking into flights, denial or lack of access to necessary information and support pre-flight, and that accessible flight options were poorer in regional and remote locations. The royal commission also heard that discrimination and poor service were more prominent amid flight cancellations \u2013 which were at record levels in the middle of the year. People with disabilities said they were seen as an \u201cafterthought\u201d when passengers on cancelled flights are managed. Participants also told the royal commission that whenever issues arise when flying domestically, they frequently do not receive \u201ctimely and appropriate responses by Airlines\u201d, with participants reporting experiences of being \u201csilenced\u201d and \u201cdismissed\u201d. \u201cAirlines are good at \u2018dehumanising\u2019 people with disabilities,\u201d one participant told the royal commission workshop. \u201cWhen issues are brought to them, they are easily dismissed and not taken seriously.\u201d Another participant, the disability advocate Zoe Simmons, said: \u201cOur stories just get swept under the rug. We get told we are the problem. People don\u2019t realise how widespread the problem is.\u201d Acceptance of assistance dogs was also raised as an issue. Participants reported it is common to be barred from travelling on flights with their assistance dogs. The royal commission also heard that most aircraft limit the number of wheelchairs to two per flight, and that some aircraft do not allow passengers to bring their wheelchairs on board and instead require passengers to transfer into aisle chairs. The royal commission\u2019s insights follow the Guardian\u2019s reporting of travellers with a disability being rejected assistance and left stranded at airports \u2013 with their complaints falling on deaf ears. In August, Tony Jones, who relies on a wheelchair due to a spinal cord injury, lodged a complaint with the Australian Human Rights Commission after he was turned away at the gate when trying to board a Jetstar flight in Sydney. Lawyers representing Jones have said there are low levels of industry compliance with disability standards, and that the onus is not on airlines and airports to comply but rather on individuals to make discrimination complaints \u2013 with the AHRC the only avenue."

                    "body": "Reading the Brazil attacking options aloud would make any opposition manager feel a little nervous. Tite could start with Neymar, Vin\u00edcius J\u00fanior, Richarlison and Raphinha and if things are not going their way he has Gabriel Jesus, Gabriel Martinelli, Rodrygo, Antony and Pedro in reserve. They will take some stopping in Qatar.\nI have always had a soft spot for Brazil \u2013 I would buy the yellow and blue kit as a kid \u2013 because of all their incredible players. We are in another era of brilliant Brazilian forwards 20 years after they last won the World Cup, when Ronaldo led them to glory. They are on a great run of form, having not lost since their Copa Am\u00e9rica final defeat by Argentina in July last year. I think they will need to face their old South American rivals again in the semi-finals and whoever gets the better of that match will become champions.\nPeople keep saying how it could be Lionel Messi\u2019s final tournament but it could be Neymar\u2019s too, and both will be especially motivated by the prospect of a winner\u2019s medal. It will be interesting to see which of those two Paris Saint-Germain teammates fares better. I think Messi will win the Golden Boot but Brazil have a slight edge over Argentina.\n\nTournament football requires match-winners and Brazil have an array of them. Games are so close because of how data can be used to help set up a team to be compact and nullify threats, but Brazil\u2019s starters and finishers can turn any match in their favour.\nTite has said it will be a case of horses for courses when it comes to selection. The philosophy of Brazil will never change but the coach may decide for a certain game he wants someone who can run in behind, greater physicality from Richarlison, or he could want to press more aggressively or overload in wide areas. Tite will have seen what Jesus has done since moving to Arsenal and may want to go with him. For one-v-one situations on the flanks, will he turn to Vin\u00edcius or Martinelli? Whatever he needs, Tite can look at his squad and pick accordingly and he will be spoiled for choice.\nBehind that they will have a very experienced midfield and defence. Casemiro will be at the heart of it and everyone has seen the difference he makes to a team. Brazil will need to stop the transition, which is what Casemiro, Fred or Fabinho are in the side to do, because transitions will be hugely significant. The central midfield combination will have a big job because Brazil\u2019s defence is ageing. On the upside, the older a player is, the more experience they have and that could be vital. There is not much Dani Alves and Thiago Silva have not witnessed and their presence could help their younger teammates.\n\nPreviously Brazil have not been a pressing team but they will now press from the front because they want to win the ball as high as possible. They may require fewer defenders because Tite will know if this plan works out, the ball is not going to make it into the areas where opponents can hurt them. I like that Tite is not going to change his principles and why would he with such an arsenal at his disposal?\nOn paper, Brazil should beat Serbia, Switzerland and Cameroon in their Group G games and score goals to ignite the campaign. If a team get a good start, it is a great boost. Everything in tournament football is anchored in momentum, helping to grow confidence as each successful match passes.\n\nEach team in this World Cup has a weak unit. France have lost their midfield from four years ago through injury, England\u2019s back four looks fragile and Brazil\u2019s defence is getting old. It will be a case of who manages their problem the best.\nIf England are to challenge, they will need to gather momentum. In international football I am a huge fan of experience and Gareth Southgate has gone with high cap accumulation in his squad \u2013 820 between them. This is his third major tournament and it is the most caps he\u2019s gone with. Kyle Walker\u2019s fitness is unknown and Harry Maguire is not playing for his club, meaning the England defence will be desperate for an early morale-boosting clean sheet. Southgate also has options to bring on if he needs to win a game. A forward line of Phil Foden, Harry Kane and Raheem Sterling means England will score goals but it is the other end they need to pay attention to.\n\nI would love England to make it to the final but I\u2019m tipping Spain to get there. In last year\u2019s Euros, Spain were knocked out by the eventual winners, Italy, on penalties in the semi-finals. Their young players have grown in maturity and understanding. The only problem is scoring goals. Brazil have goalscorers all over the pitch but that cannot be said of Luis Enrique\u2019s side. Spain have a good opportunity if they can find a consistent scorer.\nEngland will need fans behind them. Even though they are thousands of miles away, they will feel the support. If they are not to win it, hopefully I will have my second team to fall back on."

                    "body": "\u201cI asked myself the question and my answer was that they can\u2019t kill my passion: I still love football,\u201d Thomas Hitzlsperger says, but he knows they have tried. It is nine years since he became the first Premier League footballer to reveal he is gay, a decision that improved his life and those of others too. \u201cEven today,\u201d he says, \u201csomeone came up to me and said: \u2018Are you who I think you are?\u2019 I said: \u2018Probably.\u2019 He put his thumbs up, said: \u2018Good on you.\u2019\n\u201cAnd that\u2019s so powerful, which is why I say to others: it\u2019s not just your personal situation, which is of course the most important thing. And that\u2019s why I don\u2019t stop speaking up. Now when I reflect, my decision was all about what impact I can have on society, without overdoing it.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019d be surprised how many people you can reach,\u201d the former Aston Villa, West Ham and Everton midfielder says, reflecting on the role of LGBTQ supporters\u2019 groups, the increase in symbolism, a shift in attitudes at clubs embracing the gay community. He discusses how more athletes have stood up, how he \u201cwould love to see a big, active player come out\u201d, and how there has been a \u201cbig, big change\u201d. He says: \u201cThe environment is constantly improving in football, at least in most parts.\u201d\nAnd then on Sunday, the World Cup kicks off in a country where being gay is illegal. Only last week Khalid Salman, an ambassador for the competition, described homosexuality as a \u201cmental defect\u201d. Football enabled this, politicians and sports people have justified or normalised it. David Beckham has been paid to promote Qatar.\n\u201cIt\u2019s just wrong,\u201d Hitzlsperger says, and nor is the \u201csickening\u201d situation for homosexuals in Qatar the only aspect that concerns him. Indeed his discussion now, and the focus of a documentary he has just filmed in Qatar and Nepal, begins instead with the widow describing her husband coming home in a coffin, the workers he met who go unpaid. Those are the stories that have left him wondering where the line is. Not just their line \u2013 that, he thinks, is all too clear \u2013 but his own.\n\nThe former player \u2013 who represented Germany 52 times, played in a World Cup and a European Championship and won the Bundesliga with VfB Stuttgart \u2013 has grappled with how he should engage with a tournament he will be watching from a studio in Mainz for German television.\nEven doing that meant examining his conscience; while others, such as Gary Neville with beIN Sports, have chosen to go to the Gulf state, Hitzlsperger says: \u201cIf I had the option, I wouldn\u2019t: it just doesn\u2019t feel right after what I have seen, the things I have said in public. You can\u2019t be paid by Qatar or Fifa and at the same time criticise them, it doesn\u2019t make sense.\n\u201cYou see the world we live in: how sick it is that we allowed Qatar to buy the right to send pictures to the world for four weeks, presenting themselves as something they\u2019re not. It\u2019s not just sad, it\u2019s sick.\n\u201cA Nepali worker told me he saw people collapse in the heat, so they\u2019re put in a room to cool down for an hour, then you have to work again. The paperwork says: \u2018Died in his sleep.\u2019 That\u2019s not the reason. The government says the Kafala system doesn\u2019t exist but it still does, in practice. There are so many things you think: this must not happen. But it does. And to me Fifa allowed it to happen.\n\n\u201cI spoke to a woman from Human Rights Watch who said Qatari officials have figures but don\u2019t publish them. I met a young woman there who tried to show me how open it was and when worker deaths came up, she said the criticism was not justified. She even used the phrase \u2018fake news\u2019. She doesn\u2019t get to see it: she thinks the west is against Qatar. So it\u2019s difficult to judge how many deaths there have been, but it\u2019s not three.\u201d\nThree is the number the Fifa president, Gianni Infantino, claimed.\n\u201cPeople criticise Qatar, but we have to discuss Fifa\u2019s role, those from the former executive committee who took the money,\u201d Hitzlsperger says. \u201cBecause if no one would take it, if no one received it, Qatar would have a problem. But the greed in the football business is just immense.\u201d\nFifa has since acknowledged these wrongdoings and the need for reform, in the 2017 Garcia report.\n\u201cThere is so much money involved and some people have no morals and just take it. You find a PR agency, you pay them, and they give you a reason. I spoke to Fifa\u2019s media department. They\u2019re incredibly nice, kind people but they make you believe they\u2019re trying everything to get the conversation going and it never happens, so they are smart. It would have been easy for Infantino to explain the improvements, the changes, to say why it makes sense to give Qatar the World Cup. He\u2019s smart enough, but he refuses to speak: why? Why aren\u2019t you more transparent?\u201d\nInstead, Infantino sent a letter to the 32 national federations telling them to focus purely on the football now. \u201cThat shows how fed up they are,\u201d Hitzlsperger says. The Qatari organisers are too, some suggesting that racism lies beneath criticism.\n\u201cThat\u2019s totally understandable,\u201d Hitzlsperger says. \u201cPut ourselves in their shoes: there\u2019s a point where you say: \u2018Look, we\u2019ve had enough, we\u2019ve changed.\u2019 And there has been change, probably more than in Saudi Arabia and other Gulf states. We have to mention in their defence that they\u2019ve spent four years with the blockade as well. There\u2019s probably fear. Hosting a tournament is a way of protecting themselves \u2013 as is investing in football clubs. I understand that.\n\u201cBut the price is that it costs lives. And if you bring race into it: prove it, name the people who are racist. We have to understand that they know they can buy whatever they want: you offer people money, they take it. But suddenly there are people saying: \u2018We don\u2019t want your money.\u2019\u201d\nThe question is what can be done now? Hitzlsperger understands that more was not said or done sooner when real change may have been possible \u2013 \u201cthat\u2019s just human nature and I\u2019m not going to blame journalists as it wasn\u2019t on the agenda: why would you talk about Qatar five years ago?\u201d \u2013 and he has doubts about the efficacy of statements such as the One Love rainbow armband to be worn by 10 captains.\n\n\u201cThe original idea was to get together among the European federations and come up with the best idea,\u201d he says, \u201cbut the end product is an armband that possibly means a lot but doesn\u2019t upset anybody. It becomes generic, people go: \u2018What does it mean?\u2019 Then they move on. It doesn\u2019t start a debate. We know the rainbow flag symbol upsets people. People know what it stands for \u2013 and some in Qatar don\u2019t like it so much. That\u2019s stronger.\u201d\nThere are broader conclusions. \u201cThe question has been why don\u2019t teams boycott the tournament? They can\u2019t even agree on an armband,\u201d Hitzlsperger says. Besides, this goes beyond sport. \u201cNot long ago the German FA president and the interior minister said they had been reassured by the Qatari interior minister that everybody would be safe. And you think: what world are we living in?! That someone has to give a guarantee!\u201d\nAnd the message may also be lost in the noise. \u201cWhen it\u2019s every day even people who agree think: \u2018I can\u2019t hear this any more,\u2019\u201d Hitzlsperger concedes. \u201cI\u2019m trying to find a balance between saying it, refusing to be quiet, and not saying it every day. It\u2019s a shame: it destroys part of the game.\u201d\nAh, the game. Hitzlsperger talks eloquently about it. He discusses the evolution in the German side since 2008, laughing about how they needed to get rid of him first and recalling a European Championship final where he could not get near Spain. He talks of Jamal Musiala, a player he can\u2019t quite stop himself momentarily likening to Lionel Messi, concluding: \u201cHe said he wants to become one of the best in the world: I\u2019d put money on that.\u201d\nAnd there\u2019s a fondness for the England manager he first met at 18, recalling Gareth Southgate as a player \u201cwho stood out, smarter\u201d, \u201ca kind man\u201d, a \u201cmodern leader\u201d.\nYet that\u2019s the point: for now at least, the game is lost, used and abused, taken from those for whom it is everything. Hitzlsperger is trying to resist, unwilling to let go. \u201cI still love football but people come into it who don\u2019t know what it means to fans, to players.\n\u201cEverything changes, money dictates everything. I don\u2019t know at what point I will give up, go and watch Sunday league. But I still love it. It\u2019s tiring: everything that has happened makes you not want to watch, but they haven\u2019t managed to kill my passion for the game.\u201d"

                    "body": "Amid a cacophony of beeping car horns, fireworks, and people hanging from car windows waving flags, cheering football fans poured on to Paris\u2019s Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es on Wednesday night to celebrate France beating Morocco to reach the World Cup final, hoping it would become the first country in 60 years to retain the title. \u201cWe\u2019re in the final!\u201d yelled Romain, 16, who had high school the next day but was planning a late night celebrating. \u201cWhen France won the World Cup in 2018, I was 12 and couldn\u2019t really celebrate in the streets,\u201d he said. \u201cIt feels brilliant tonight, but facing Argentina will be close, nail-biting.\u201d People danced, cheered and climbed lampposts and traffic lights as vans of police stood guard. More than 2,000 officers, including riot police in body armour, were stationed around the Champs-Elys\u00e9es and across Paris in order to control the crowds and keep them to the pavements. More than 5,000 officers were deployed in the greater Paris area, and a total of 10,000 across the country. In Lyon, local media reported that police had fired teargas after stones and projectiles were thrown at them.  Even as the match was nearing the end, workmen with power drills were still hastily boarding up the windows of sports shops and other businesses on the Champs-Elys\u00e9es as a precaution against vandalism, but the crowds remained calm, and included some families and children in Santa hats. Large numbers of dual French-Moroccan nationals had sat together in nearby bars watching the champions, France, face the outsider success story, Morocco, and there were also Moroccan flags amid the celebrating crowd on the Champs-Elys\u00e9es. Some fans were wrapped in French and Moroccan flags tied together, while others hanging out of car windows waved the flags of both countries at once.  Rays, a care worker in the southern town of Montpellier, had come to Paris to celebrate his 21st birthday the night before. He watched the match wrapped in the Moroccan flag alongside friends who were France fans sporting tricolour face paint. \u201cFrance played brilliantly,\u201d he said. \u201cI was born in France to Moroccan and Algerian parents. I really, really wanted Morocco to be the first African team to make it to the World Cup final. It would have been historic, but it wasn\u2019t to be. Argentina will be hard to beat now \u2013 Messi wants one last trophy.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m really happy and proud. Both teams played so well,\u201d said Domitilla, 22, a French-Italian communications worker wearing red, white and blue face paint who had watched the match in a local bar. She lives in a flat near the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es. \u201cI\u2019m a bit worried that I won\u2019t get any sleep tonight,\u201d she said as cars streamed towards the avenue, beeping furiously, and fireworks went off. Alexis, 25, a French engineer, said: \u201cThe last time they won the World Cup, I was at a scout camp in the countryside, so it\u2019s good to be following it in the city now. France have done brilliantly.\u201d A group of six off-duty police officers wearing red, white and blue facepaint and draped in French flags were heading from a bar to the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es to celebrate. \u201cIt was a magnificent game, beautiful to watch. Morocco was a very strong team,\u201d said one. \u201cNow we just hope the night goes OK for our colleagues policing here. We won\u2019t stay late \u2013 we\u2019ve got work in the morning.\u201d"

The change would have happened earlier but apparently company suits feared Snickers sounded too much like knickers so repressed Brits would be too flushed in the cheeks to buy it. Anyway, the thing that really bothered the corner shop-bothering folk was whether nougat, peanuts, chocolate and caramel could still taste the same with a different name. BA Baracus seemed to think so. You see, Mars could afford to hire Mr T to give their product the big sell by getting him to reassure worried consumers by the medium of pointing and shouting loudly at them that they\u2019re fools if they didn\u2019t like it. At Fiv \u2026 sorry, Football Daily Towers, we\u2019ve got, erm, let\u2019s see, um \u2026 \u201cHello? Hello? Uncle? Granny? Anybody?!\u201d Is it cold in here?\nAnyway, we can tell you where it isn\u2019t cold. Doha. It\u2019s 32C and sizzling as teams and journalists descend on the desert in mid-November for this completely normal and in-no-way egregious Human Rights World Cup. England were greeted at their team hotel by a crowd of enthusiastic expat Indians singing \u201cThree Lions\u201d. There were accusations that they weren\u2019t proper England fans \u2013 presumably because not one of them had a lit flare stuck up their backside or was ostentatiously hoovering up marching powder off the back of their hand while stood on a phone box. But with searingly witty new ditties such as \u201cPickford is our super keeper\u201d being belted out, perhaps these newly-discovered supporters should be embraced.\nThe Qatar [HR] World Cup Supreme Committee denied they were \u201cfake\u201d fans. \u201cWe thoroughly reject these assertions, which are both disappointing and unsurprising,\u201d blathered a statement. Much like Snickers over three decades ago, this tournament is hard to get our simple head around. Who knows what\u2019s legit any more? We already know, there really are \u201cpaid\u201d England fans in Doha. How\u2019s your bank balance, David? And, of course, the 40 supporters being given free flights and a \u00a360-a-day spend to \u201cstand up, sing the song/chant, wave your flags\u201d and play the Great Escape on a trumpet repeatedly for the cause which, let\u2019s be clear, is to polish the Gulf nation state\u2019s image.\n\nOne thing we can say for certain is that getting stuck into a mood-enhancer will be a costly and perhaps soul-crushing business. It will cost \u00a312 for just less than a pint of Budweiser. Budweiser, for heaven\u2019s sake! Can you taste the joy? Well, you might if you can find the right place and time to buy it. The owner of the \u201cKing of Beers\u201d grovelled that it was trying to deliver \u201cthe best possible consumer experience under the new circumstances\u201d after being told to move its stalls to less visible spots outside stadiums by the Supreme Committee, which confirmed there will be specific \u201cpouring times\u201d and a limit of four units per person. So good luck getting a hangover, then. Mind you, with reports of journalists being harassed on the streets already, and campaigners saying that gay Qataris are being physically abused then recruited as agents to track down other LGBTQ+ citizens, it is most likely that the game itself is the one left with the shakes when this dystopian chapter in football\u2019s history ends.\nQUOTE OF THE DAY\n\u201cWhy are we so competitive? Because they teach us to be. Because pitches exist, everywhere. In every neighbourhood, every place, however deprived. Wherever there\u2019s space to kick a ball, there\u2019s a game. That competitiveness demanded as a professional is already there: you\u2019ve been doing it all your life, every day, in the rain, any surface, playing barefoot, breaking a toe, wrapping it up and carrying on. I always say that in football it\u2019s not the same to play as to compete\u201d \u2013 Edinson Cavani\u2019s chat with Sid Lowe is well worth your time, on getting joy from nature, wanting to be a vet and why Uruguay succeed.\n\nFOOTBALL DAILY LETTERS\n\u201cMy congratulations to the marketing department on the rebranding of The Fiver to Football Daily. A change from a name suggesting something of universal value to one signalling a dreary, repetitive, never-ending stream of content. At least somebody working there knows what they\u2019re doing\u201d \u2013 Mathias Stigsgaard.\n\u201cFootball Daily? Weird Uncle Football Daily doesn\u2019t really have the same ring, does it? Is this going to be like when St James\u2019 Park was rebranded as the Sports Direct Soccerdome and everyone just ignored it and carried on as before?\u201d \u2013 Dom Ward.\n\u201cSurely Football Daily is the very opposite of STOP FOOTBALL?\u201d \u2013 David Maddock.\n\u201cHaving followed David Squires\u2019s series in the run-up to HRWC, I must admit I went from tsk, tsking over the plight of the workers to at least wondering if I should even watch the spectacle. But being a weak and spineless sort, I knew I\u2019d eventually relent \u2026 it\u2019s the (HR) World Cup after all. But after his final part yesterday, I now know I am done with it. So thank you to Squires, for helping me grow a spine. RIP Rupchandra Rumba and all the rest of your departed colleagues\u201d \u2013 Mike Fichtner.\n\u201cAs a consultant in orthopaedic and trauma surgery, I can reassure Adam Forde (yesterday\u2019s letters) that I am well versed in the myriad ways in which a bone can twang, pop, snap, crack and doink. Or maybe that\u2019s now two reputations in tatters?\u201d \u2013 Dan Westacott.\nSend your letters to the.boss@theguardian.com. And you can always tweet Football Daily via @guardian_sport.

                    "body": "Argentina Toby Donald, 11Toby lives in Salisbury, but used to live in Catalonia (near his hero Lionel Messi). He saw Argentina win the Copa Am\u00e9rica against Brazil in 2021. My mum is from Argentina and my dad is from England \u2013 if they meet in this World Cup, it will be fun to watch them arguing! My mum went to the stadium in Buenos Aires to see a game in the 1978 tournament, when she was younger than me. She\u2019s always telling me about people celebrating in the street when Argentina won.  My friends know how much I love Argentinian football. My favourite players are, of course, Messi, Dybala, Acu\u00f1a and \u201cDibu\u201d Mart\u00ednez, who plays for Aston Villa. Every time Argentina plays, I will wear the full kit, putting paper flags that I\u2019ve printed around the house. If they get knocked out, I will support England, and either South Korea or Portugal.  I have some aspects of Argentinian culture in me since I love terer\u00e9 and mate, which are like green tea. Terer\u00e9 is made with cold water and fruit flavours, and mate with hot water. Mum\u2019s friend has an Argentinean food truck in Folkestone, and she makes me churros. During the matches, we will eat empanadas, too.  I use a lot of vocabulary from Argentina, and have my mom\u2019s accent. I am happy about my dual nationality. It was my idea \u2013 this year we went to the consulate, so I am also Argentinian now. I have a passport, so when I am a professional footballer, I can play for Argentina. Australia Wilf Dehlsen, six, and Archie Dehlsen, 10  Wilf and Archie\u2019s mum is Australian, but has been in London for 16 years. Their English dad\u2019s parents are from New Zealand and Australia. The boys were born in the UK and only have UK passports. Archie My favourite Australian players are the ones I know from the Premier League, such as Matthew Ryan and Aaron Mooy. I can\u2019t wait to see how far they get. It\u2019s a tough group with France and Denmark, but you never know. We\u2019ll be cheering Australia on, wearing our kit \u2013 and FaceTiming our cousins in Australia at the same time! If there\u2019s a match on at the weekend, we will probably be with our Australian friends to watch it, maybe at the pub. If they get knocked out, I will be supporting England as this is my home and I\u2019ve lived here all my life. I think Daddy will support England all the way, but Mummy will support Australia. I love football. I play four times a week. I\u2019ve been to Australia a few times and can\u2019t wait to go back. Wilf I don\u2019t remember the last World Cup because I was too young, but I\u2019m really excited. It\u2019s clever that Australia are called the Socceroos \u2013 it\u2019s like soccer and a kangaroo mixed up. My favourite Australian food is Vegemite toast. If Australia gets knocked out, I\u2019ll support England because I\u2019m half-English. If Australia wins, I\u2019ll celebrate hard. I love playing football in the garden with Archie! Belgium Orson Berthier Ronald, five  Orson was born and lives in London. His father is English and his mother is Belgian-American, but recently became a UK citizen. Orson speaks English and French at home and goes to a local children\u2019s football class. He loves a kickabout in the square with parents and his younger brother, Lucian, Maman and Papa. I\u2019m Belgian, English and American, and I can draw all the flags. All three teams are playing, but I\u2019ll support Belgium and wear my strip. I like the way the \u201cB\u201d has been done on it \u2013 it\u2019s clever. Papa supports England, so if Belgium play them, we\u2019ll be shouting for different teams. I\u2019d like to watch the games with Nanou [Orson\u2019s grandmother], but she lives in Waterloo, in Belgium. If Belgium get to the final, I\u2019ll invite my friend Julius to watch it with us, even though he supports Sweden. We\u2019ll have Belgian food. I could make some madeleines with Maman, and we could have gaufres (waffles) with sugar and lemon. Papa would have moules et frites \u2013 I\u2019d just have the frites. Brazil Nicholas Goncalves-Newman, 14  Nick\u2019s Brazilian parents moved to the UK in 2005 from a small town called Amambai, and he was born in Hastings, where he still lives. His grandparents, aunties, uncles and cousins live in Brazil \u2013 he\u2019s visited three or four times and plans to spend more time there. Nick talks to his Brazilian cousins in Portuguese, but he admits he understands more than he can speak, and sometimes has to use Google Translate. I\u2019ve watched clips from the 70s on YouTube, with players like Pel\u00e9, as well as more recent ones featuring the likes of Ronaldo. It\u2019s cool to support the most successful World Cup team ever, but I know they\u2019re not invincible \u2013 I\u2019ve watched the 2014 game where they lost 7-1 to Germany. My older sister, Pietra, isn\u2019t interested in football, but likes the World Cup. I might have some friends round; some have Brazil shirts. I can imagine my parents inviting some of their friends, too, and having a bit of a party. Football is a real passion in Brazil \u2013 everyone seems to love it. My cousins are good players and all talk about how they dream of being professionals. But there are more opportunities over here to become a professional player than in Brazil. I\u2019ve seen Brazil and England twice at Wembley. It was a long time ago, so I don\u2019t remember much. I watch lots of local matches. My dad plays for a local team and I play for Hastings Athletic. I\u2019m a midfielder \u2013 sometimes I play left, sometimes right. I train three times a week and we\u2019re all right \u2013 we\u2019re winning some of our games. It\u2019s not something I\u2019d ever do professionally, though. I\u2019m more into music. I play piano, and one day I\u2019d like to set up a studio and hopefully get to write my own songs. Cameroon Peace-Hillary Nsangou, 12  Peace-Hillary was born in the UK to Cameroonian parents. She visited the country with her family in 2016. I\u2019m proud that my country is playing in the World Cup this year. I\u2019ll be watching with my family: my mum, my dad and maybe my sisters and uncle. My dad is a big football fan \u2013 he used to play for a club in Cameroon. I\u2019m really looking forward to seeing how far Cameroon get this year, as I\u2019m too young to remember much about the last time they appeared. I think they\u2019ll do well. I last visited Cameroon in 2016, when I was six. It was such a fun place to go because so many of my family live there, so it felt very welcoming. I visited my grandma\u2019s place and the gravestones of some of my family. We spent most of the time in the countryside on a farm where there were sheep and chickens; it was so different to my life in London. I was scared of the chickens, though, and it was very hot. There were a lot of bugs. Canada  Ivan Gonzales Wiley, eight, and Marvin Callahan Wiley, 10  Ivan and Marvin have a Canadian mother and a British father, who was a ballboy for Charlton Athletic when he was Marvin\u2019s age (he remains a Charlton fan and once won \u00a32,000 in their half-time raffle). The brothers were born in the UK and live on the south coast.  Ivan I play football every lunchtime. I\u2019m not sure what position I play, probably left wing or something. I have a special celebratory handshake that I do with my team when we win. Marvin I love being a striker. And when I\u2019m in goal, when I save the ball, it\u2019s really satisfying. Ivan We\u2019re really looking forward to watching Canada \u2013 it\u2019s the first time they\u2019ve qualified since the 1980s. Marvin We\u2019ll make our older sister, Juno, watch as well \u2013 she\u2019s 13 and not that interested, but she does play pretty well when we have a kickabout in the garden. We might have some Canadian food and drinks like poutine (french fries with cheese curds and gravy) and root beer. Ivan I hate poutine and root beer. Coffee Crisp bars and Kool-Aid? Marvin Maybe Granny will send us some Cheezies. Mum suggested painting our faces with the Canadian flag, but I\u2019m not keen on face paints. She also suggested turning our white cat, Coconut, red. I think she was joking \u2026\u2026 Ivan We watched some of the friendlies and saw Canada beat Qatar. That was pretty good, because Qatar is the host country. My favourite Canadian players are Alphonso Davies and Jonathan David. I saw a video where Alphonso got an amazing goal \u2013 there was a 1% chance of him scoring, but he did it. Marvin I like Atiba Hutchinson. He\u2019s the captain and a great midfielder. If Canada get knocked out before England, I\u2019ll support England instead. Ivan My best friend, Henry, is part-Norwegian, and my mum\u2019s great-grandparents moved to Canada from Ukraine, so I would support Norway or Ukraine, but neither of them qualified.  Marvin We have family in Canada, and they\u2019re quite carefree. Their attitude is: \u201cIt might be fun \u2013 let\u2019s do it.\u201d We drove a boat when we were there. Ivan We rode a rollercoaster down a mountain, too. We also threw axes. Costa Rica Zion Williams Monge, five, and Siara Williams Monge, three  Zion and Siara were born in the UK to a Costa Rican mother and Jamaican father. They live in Nottingham. Zion has been to Costa Rica twice, Siara has yet to visit, due to the pandemic. The girls stay in touch with their family there, including their maternal grandparents (Tita Carmen and Tito Pablo). They also have a lot of social contact with the Costa Rican community in the UK, as well as their paternal grandparents (who they call Tito Tony and Tita Audrey). They speak Spanish at home. Zion I remember going to Tita Carmen\u2019s in Costa Rica. There were green parrots, and we had chicken and rice. I like helping Mummy and Daddy cook. I help make tortilla sometimes, and gallo pinto (rice and beans). Siara I like to eat tortilla, and Jamaican dumpling. Zion We went to the Costa Rican independence party in London. Grandad and Grandma and Auntie came with us. Siara The ladies were dancing, and we danced in a circle. Zion We play football with Mummy and Daddy and their friends. I think Daddy plays best, but I\u2019m good at taking the ball. Siara We\u2019ll watch the games with Tito Tony and Tita Audrey at their house. We\u2019ll wear our Costa Rica tops. Mine says Siara on the back. Tito Pablo got it for me. Zion I want to buy a little one for Luana, our baby cousin. Siara When we\u2019re watching the World Cup, we can eat some popcorn. Zion I like popcorn! Croatia Max Stanic\u0301, 11  Max was born in London, but has lived in Zagreb, where his parents are from. He is fluent in Croatian and supports Dinamo Zagreb and Liverpool. He plays football for Brent Dynamo United, and likes that his own team have Dynamo in their name. During the 2018 World Cup, we were in London and watched all the Croatia games with our friends, who are from all different parts of the world: England, Croatia, Japan, Portugal. The best thing was when our friends came over from Croatia. One of my best friends is Buga, who is the same age as me and also loves football.  When Croatia played against England in the semi-final, we decided not to watch it with our football teammates because it could get too emotional. It was strange coming to school the next day. I was very proud and happy, but some of my friends were upset that England lost. When it came to the final, we watched together with my teammates and their parents, and everyone cheered for Croatia. I was too nervous to watch the whole game. It was very sad to have lost, but I was happy that my team had made it to the finals. Croatia is a very small country \u2013 with 4 million people, it is like half a London \u2013 so it was a huge achievement. We will watch the games in Qatar at home or with friends. We have friends from Croatia and England, but also many other countries. My uncle and his family are in Canada, and Croatia and Canada are in the same group, but we will be cheering for Croatia of course! If Croatia get knocked out, I will follow England, as many of my friends will be cheering for them. Denmark Laura Smart, 15, and Bess Smart, 12  Bess and Laura live with their Danish mum and English dad. The girls and their mum all have British and Danish dual nationality. Laura There are occasions which bring out my Danish identity, mainly Christmas and birthdays which see the house festooned in Danish flags, candles and pastries. But there are also wider events which awaken my Danishness \u2013 Eurovision, noir TV and the World Cup. Football is Denmark\u2019s national sport \u2013 though we are tiny, we pack a punch! But we take our social values seriously, and this year our away kit is a subdued black to reflect the controversy of Qatar. And if Denmark get kicked out in the first round I\u2019ll have the luxury of supporting England with Dad. Bess I like having dual nationality, as it gives a richer sense of identity. I also sometimes count up the fractions of other identities I have \u2013 Irish and Swedish \u2013 and I like to hear stories of my great-grandparents, who were travelling diplomats. I like to embrace all the diverse multicultural activities at school. So when the World Cup is on, the thing I like most is the unifying sense of many countries all coming together. It\u2019s what the world needs now. Ecuador Juan Alejandro Pachar Carmona, 10, and Juan Esteban Pachar Carmona, seven  Alejandro and Esteban\u2019s Colombian mother moved to the UK 20 years ago, and their Ecuadorian dad arrived here five years later. The boys have family in both countries, which they visited when they were younger. They live in Sutton, but have daily contact with their relatives via FaceTime and speak Spanish fluently. Esteban We are planning to watch Ecuador play while surrounded with family and friends, and I\u2019m hoping my granddad cooks a lovely hornado (roast pig) for us. Alejandro If Ecuador get knocked out, we\u2019ll carry on watching \u2013 football is our passion. I will support Brazil, Argentina and France instead. Outside of the World Cup, my favourite team is Real Madrid \u2013 I don\u2019t miss any games.  Esteban Not all of our relatives support Ecuador \u2013 part of our family is from Poland, and they want their team to win. I\u2019m sure Ecuador will do better, though. We know Jeremy Sarmiento who plays for Brighton &amp; Hove Albion and Ecuador. Brighton have several Ecuadorian players and we often watch their games. Alejandro We\u2019ve known Sarmiento for such a long time. He is my role model. My dream is to one day play alongside him in La Tri (the Ecuador team). England Yeray Sanchez Morales, 14  Yeray was born in Spain, but both his parents are Colombian. He moved to London when he was seven. Yeray likes playing both football and basketball. The last Word Cup feels a long time ago, and I didn\u2019t enjoy that one much, as England got as far as the semi-finals but didn\u2019t win. I\u2019ll be supporting England as I really appreciate the opportunities I\u2019ve had since moving here. I\u2019ve lived in the UK for nearly eight years, and feel really attached to this country \u2013 my mum and I love tea and have teatime every day. I\u2019ll be watching the whole tournament at home and my cousins are going to come round and watch with me. My favourite England player is Bukayo Saka. I really admire his perseverance. He gets bullied online, but he keeps going and proves his critics wrong. Colombia didn\u2019t qualify this year, so if England get knocked out before Spain, that\u2019s the team I\u2019ll support instead, as that\u2019s where I was born. I think my dad will be supporting Spain. If England and Spain end up playing each other, I\u2019m just going to tell him that he\u2019s going to lose. France Adam Tounsi, 11  Adam\u2019s mum and dad both have Algerian parents but were born in France. Adam goes to French school on Saturdays and speaks French fluently at home. My grandparents live near Grenoble in the French Alps. We visit them at Christmas and in the summer \u2013 it\u2019s hotter than in England and the mountains are very beautiful. Sometimes we go swimming. I remember France winning the 2018 World Cup, and I\u2019ve watched the game since. We beat Croatia 4-2. I\u2019ve seen the 1998 win, too, where we beat Brazil 3-0 on home turf.  Even though France have been winning nearly all their games recently, they have lost to some smaller teams. They\u2019ve been playing pretty well, but not to their full potential. I like N\u2019Golo Kant\u00e9, Karim Benzema and Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 best because they play well, they play fairly, and they don\u2019t fight.  I do think we stand a very good chance of winning again this year, and if we do I\u2019ll scream out: \u201cYeah! France won!\u201d Whether I\u2019ll scream it in English or French, I don\u2019t know. Germany Rebecca Eichler, nine  Rebecca lives in Hastings with her mum, Jackie, who moved to the UK from Germany when she was three. She is one of only two girls who play for the Hastings Wanderers U10s.  I really like being a quarter German, especially at Christmas when we have our St Nicholas stockings early \u2013 on 6 December! Most of the things my friends do on Christmas Day, we do on Christmas Eve. We have real candles on the tree, which some people think looks hazardous. I\u2019m pleased to support Germany \u2013 they\u2019re a really good team with lots of squad depth. Players like Neuer and M\u00fcller have been playing for a while \u2013 in fact this is probably their last chance at a World Cup. But they also have youngsters who haven\u2019t played in the World Cup yet, and they should also get a chance, like Jamal Musiala. I think Germany will at least make the semis or quarter-finals, and they could go all the way.  I know one girl at school who\u2019s supporting Germany. It would be harder to support England because they don\u2019t do that well sometimes. Germany have better teamwork \u2013 they\u2019re better at passing. Thomas M\u00fcller is my favourite player: he\u2019s funny and likes to assist a lot \u2013 his nickname is \u201cthe assist king\u201d. I try to play like him. This is my fourth year playing with Hastings Wanderers. It\u2019s a mixed team, but until recently I was the only girl. My mum sometimes coaches us, which feels odd, but she\u2019s doing quite a good job. Ghana  Benedith Gyanfiduah, 14  Benedith was born in Italy and raised in England, but his parents are from Ghana. He enjoys football and basketball at school. I remember France winning in 2018. Unfortunately, Ghana didn\u2019t qualify that time \u2013 I was very unimpressed, as usually they\u2019re a really good team and it was disappointing to see them slip. I\u2019ve watched the game from 2010, when Ghana played Uruguay. If we\u2019d won, we would have been the first African team to make the semi-finals.  My favourite player was Michael Essien \u2013 he\u2019s the reason I like Chelsea as well. I\u2019m excited to see how the team do this year, but I\u2019ll be happy to back England if Ghana get knocked out first \u2013 I was raised here, after all. My uncle and his wife will be coming round to watch with us, and we\u2019ll have Ghanaian food like jollof rice and fufu [a side dish made from cassava and plantain]. I haven\u2019t visited Ghana since I was very young, when I met my grandma and cousins, which made me very happy. I like the people there. We are a very peaceful, down-to-earth nation. Iran Tinoosh Simpkins, 15  Tinoosh was born in London to an Iranian mother and British father. He\u2019s a fan of Arsenal, the first team he ever watched, even though his mum thinks he should support his local team, Crystal Palace. I\u2019m the only one who watches football in my family. My dad\u2019s not into it, and my brother stopped liking it after he got hit in the stomach with a football three times in a row. He and Dad do watch World Cup games, though, and so does Mum when Iran are playing. I support both Iran and England. During the last World Cup I was only 10, but I remember watching Iran play in the group stages. We have snacks while watching the games, like pistachios which my grandma Maman Farideh brings back when she goes on trips to Iran. We store them in the freezer and only get them out for special occasions. We also have ajil, which is a mix of nuts and seeds such as pumpkin, melon and sunflower seeds. You can get salty or sweet ajil \u2013 the sweet kind also has dried fruit like raisins and mulberries. My favourite snack is Iranian Wotsits, which are called Pofak. I nag my parents to buy Pofak whenever we go to Iranian grocers, and to order chelo kabab from Iranian restaurants. I was only one when I last went to Iran, and I don\u2019t remember it. Iranians really like football, and my mum\u2019s family found it strange that my dad doesn\u2019t watch it. They even follow the Premier League. Iran did OK last time \u2013 it was very exciting to see them get their first win since 1998. My mum was really angry when we had a goal disallowed against Spain. Japan Iena Mirto, nine, and Yuji Mirto, 12  Iena and Yuji live in Brighton with their Japanese mother and Italian father. Their favourite member of the Japanese squad is Kaoru Mitoma because he plays for their local team, Brighton &amp; Hove Albion. Iena I\u2019m going to make a banner with the Japanese flag on and put it up in the living room. Hopefully Mum will make udon noodles and sushi for us during the matches \u2013 they\u2019re my favourites. Yuji I\u2019ll be wearing the strip and cheering the team on! Iena We\u2019ve never lived in Japan, but we visit every year or two. We love Japanese technology and anime, especially Studio Ghibli. Yuji We have dual nationality, Japanese and British, and our dad is Italian, so we\u2019re happy to cheer on all three teams. I will scream a lot if Japan wins. Iena I\u2019ll be screaming with joy, but also from the shock. Mexico Diego Bastian Cornejo-Kersten, nine  Diego was born in Mexico City and moved to the UK during the last World Cup. He has a Mexican father and German mother, and speaks English, German and Spanish fluently. Diego plays football at home with his younger sister and also at school, where he likes being in goal best, but enjoys scoring goals as a midfielder. We were still in Mexico when El Tri beat Germany in 2018. Me and Dad were wearing the Mexican shirt, and my mum and sister the German shirt. I was very excited to see Mexico win, but sad to see my mum disappointed. When we arrived in the UK I didn\u2019t speak a word of English, so I had to learn really quickly. Now my teachers can\u2019t believe I couldn\u2019t speak English just a few years ago. We usually visit Mexico once a year, and I love spending time with my grandma and grandpa \u2013 but England is my home now. I love that I am a mix of cultures. I\u2019m proud to follow El Tri. My favourite Mexican player of all time is Jorge Campos, an amazing goalkeeper who let almost no goals in. His outfit was very colourful, and I think it was great because it distracted the players of the opposing team. Although he doesn\u2019t play any more, I love watching videos of him on YouTube. I love Chucky Lozano\u2019s energy: he never stops running after the ball, and he is the one who scored against Germany \u2013 sorry, Mum!  I really hope Mexico win the World Cup, but we usually get knocked out quickly. If that happens, I will support Germany, though I also follow England. My favourite English player is Raheem Sterling, and my favourite German one is Bastian Schweinsteiger. My name is actually Diego Bastian, like him. Morocco Badr Riane, 11  Badr was born in the UK to Moroccan parents. They speak Arabic at home.  My whole family gets together to watch Morocco play. We didn\u2019t do that well at the last World Cup, but you always feel that Morocco are trying really hard.  I love visiting Morocco because the weather\u2019s so good. It\u2019s a tropical climate and I love the beaches \u2013 they\u2019re so clean. I feel proud of my heritage because Morocco is a strong country. Moroccans understand each other, and always try to help each other. If I had to pick one word to describe the country it would be \u201cjoyful\u201d. I have enough Moroccan friends in London to have a big celebration if we win. If we don\u2019t get further than we did in 2018, I\u2019ll support Brazil \u2013 their team includes most of my favourite players. The Netherlands  Lasse van de Lagemaat, seven  Lasse is the youngest of four siblings who were born in the Netherlands but live in Woking. Lasse supports the Oranje, Arsenal, because most of his school friends do, and Feyenoord. I was a toddler for the last World Cup and the Netherlands didn\u2019t qualify. But I got to wear orange for last year\u2019s Euros and for the Orange Lionesses) this year. I made some Dutch flags, and at school we made English flags, and I waved them when we watched the final. My brother and my dad went to a Dutch pub in London to watch the Oranje play. We did well in the Nations League and won against Belgium, which is important for us. At the Euros, we were not as good as England, and I was bullied a bit by my friends for wearing my orange kit to the after-school club. But in the last games, Oranje won and England lost, so now I can tell my friends the Netherlands is better than England. My favourite player is Vivianne Miedema, because she plays for Oranje and Arsenal. When I play football with my dad and siblings, I want to be Arsenal, and my dad\u2019s Feyenoord. We\u2019re going to watch the matches at home. I think I\u2019ll make some decorations with my brother and sisters. This time the World Cup is when we\u2019re celebrating St Nicholas, so we\u2019ll eat pepernoten [spiced biscuits]. When we reach the semis or the finals, my dad will take us to a Dutch pub to watch, or the Dutch Church, where he is the minister. I hope we\u2019ll win so I can celebrate with my cousins when we\u2019re in Holland at Christmas. Poland Bruno Tiger Taylor, three, and George Taylor, six   George and Bruno were born in the UK to a Polish mother and English father. Football is at the heart of their Polish family, who they visit every year in P\u0142ock, on the Vistula river. George plays football with his older cousin, Maciej, who helps him practice his tackling, and although young, Bruno is an agile player who can put up a fight. George When we\u2019re in Poland, I watch football on TV with my dziadek [grandad]. He likes Newcastle United and West Bromwich Albion, and so does my grandma. Last summer we wanted to see a Wis\u0142a P\u0142ock game, but they weren\u2019t playing at home while we were there. We\u2019ve been to the stadium in Warsaw, though and maybe we\u2019ll see them play next year. My favourite Polish player is Robert Lewandowski. He\u2019s at FC Barcelona, and he is very fast and keeps scoring goals. I hope Matty Cash [Poland\u2019s England-born right back] will be playing, too. Bruno We\u2019re going to wear our football tops to watch the World Cup. George We\u2019ll paint our faces in red and white, too, like Polish flags. We\u2019ll have a party if we win and eat kie\u0142basa [sausage], kaszanka [blood sausage] and bigos [stew]. Bruno We\u2019ll sing, \u201cPolska, Bia\u0142o-Czerwoni,\u201d and clap and shout \u201cPolska!\u201d Portugal  Gabriel Almeida, 14  Gabriel was born in Portugal and moved to the UK when he was four. He speaks Portuguese and says there was never any doubt who he\u2019d support: \u201cI\u2019ve always been Portuguese and always will be.\u201d I never miss any game they play if I can help it. Portugal beating France in the Euro finals in 2016 was one of the best moments of my life. My favourite player is Cristiano Ronaldo, because what he\u2019s done throughout the years is incredible. I\u2019m a keen footballer. I\u2019m in my school team \u2013 we won our last game even though the other team cheated. I\u2019ve also played for Arsenal for the past six months. I dream of one day playing for Portugal. I go back during the holidays and love it there.  I won\u2019t miss a Portugal game \u2013 I just want to see my team win. If they did get knocked out \u2013 and they won\u2019t \u2013 I\u2019d support Brazil, because their fans speak the same language. I look forward to celebrating Portugal\u2019s victory with other fans. There\u2019s a big Portuguese community in London, and I remember them celebrating all down the South Lambeth Road last time we won the Euros \u2013 more than a thousand people singing and chanting. There are other Portuguese students at my school, so I\u2019ll make sure they\u2019ll all be supporting the team. If they won\u2019t, it\u2019s a disgrace! Qatar Ali Khalid Al-Mawlawi, 22  Ali is a third-year student studying law in London. After his degree, he plans to move back to Qatar to work in the energy sector. I\u2019ve been into football since I was born. Literally the first thing I ever wore was a tiny kit from one of the local teams. When I was younger, I used to mostly be a supporter of the Spanish league, but then I grew up and realised the English league is the best. I didn\u2019t want to be a glory-hunter, supporting United, for example, when Fergie was in charge \u2013 it was not what I stand for. So I tried to find a team I had a link with. My great-uncle studied in Durham in the 60s and 70s, and his team was Sunderland. He saw them win the FA Cup in 1973. So that\u2019s the team I chose. They\u2019re doing really well under their new French owner. They\u2019re in the championship and I hope they get the qualifiers this year. I haven\u2019t seen them play while I\u2019ve been in London \u2013 home games are four hours each way on the train, so I keep hoping they\u2019ll play a London team like QPR. I played a lot of football throughout my school years and was a junior varsity player. I\u2019ve been to a couple of tournaments abroad and dreamed of training at the Aspire Academy in Doha. I have cousins who are there, but my father wanted me to continue with my studies. But Qataris have a huge love for football \u2013 everyone in Doha has a fantasy league. Everyone!  When Qatar was announced as hosts in 2010, I was at my uncle\u2019s house watching with my cousins and we all ran out into the street \u2013 the whole neighbourhood seemed to be out there. It was beautiful. This is the national team\u2019s first time in the World Cup, but we\u2019ve been doing well under F\u00e9lix S\u00e1nchez. We had a great victory in 2019 at the Asian Cup. I\u2019ve been to many of the new stadiums, and actually volunteered for the Fifa Club World Cup and studied at Education City, where one of the stadiums is located. The country\u2019s infrastructure has developed at an insane rate over the past 10 years in the run-up to the tournament, and every time I go back to Doha for a vacation it feels like a different city \u2013 I keep getting lost. I\u2019m not blind to the controversies surrounding that, but I do think Qatar has come under the spotlight more than some nations that have hosted the World Cup, such as Russia, Brazil and South Africa. I do think the light that has been shone upon workers\u2019 rights in Qatar has led to positive changes, such as the abolition of the kafala system. I don\u2019t accept that most Qataris have a problem with people being gay either, it\u2019s more about public displays of affection in general. We are a conservative country and a new nation, and all we want is for people to be patient with us. I\u2019ll be watching most of the World Cup in London, though I have a ticket for the final in Qatar \u2013 I just need to get permission from my professor to go! We wish all the best for Saudis and Moroccans, too \u2013 it\u2019s beautiful to see Arabs doing well in football. And of course I\u2019ll be watching with lots of England supporters. It would be great if they bring it back home, because I want to see the English people happy. But on the down-low, I actually support Brazil. Saudi Arabia Rowaid Mohammed Islam, six  Rowaid was born in Saudi Arabia and moved to the UK with his parents four years ago. He lives in Sheffield I like to play football at school with my friends, Maxim and Popy. I\u2019m good at passing and I\u2019m a good goalkeeper \u2013 I save lots of balls. I might like to keep on playing when I\u2019m older and perhaps one day I could play for Saudi Arabia or England. I still visit Saudi Arabia and I have family and friends there, who I like playing ping pong with. I play ping pong all day. I\u2019m as good at that as I am at football. I\u2019m going to watch with Dad and Mummy, and we\u2019ll wear our Saudi Arabia football tops. I like that they\u2019re green! Senegal  Mark Mohammed Fall, 13  Mark Mohammed was born in Dakar, Senegal, and moved to London when he was very young. He last visited Senegal when he was eight or nine. He plays for a local team in east London, training two days a week, and is also a ballboy for Arsenal, who he also supports. My favourite thing about Senegal is the food. My dad and his friends often cook Senegalese food. I remember watching the Senegal-Japan game in 2018 in a restaurant with my dad and his friends.  I also remember the Colombia game \u2013 the saddest time during that World Cup for me. We got knocked out of the group because of too many yellow cards! We were tied on goal difference with Japan, I think, and points.  I haven\u2019t been able to watch any of Senegal\u2019s international games recently because it\u2019s very hard to find the right websites to watch them on. But I do always follow the live score updates.  I think we have a good chance this year \u2013 a lot of our players are playing in the top divisions and are on good form. I also like to see some of the older players like Messi and Neymar do really well during the World Cup because I grew up watching them. Serbia Eddie, four  Eddie\u2019s grandad is from Serbia and met his English grandmother in Paris in the 1970s. Grandad is a big Red Star Belgrade and Manchester United fan. Eddie started playing football in the U4 squad for his local grassroots team in Essex last year.  When it\u2019s not the World Cup and I watch football with Daddy, we have crisps. I support Serbia and England, and think they\u2019re both going to win. I quite like the trophy \u2013 it\u2019s gold and really shiny. I\u2019m going to put flags up in the window so everyone knows we support Serbia and England. Grandad and Uncle Rich live in Manchester, but when we score a goal I\u2019ll celebrate with them on the phone. And when we win, I\u2019ll run around like an aeroplane. South Korea Noah Ji-Ha Shin, 12  Noah is a keen goalkeeper who, like his dad, was born and raised in the UK. His mum is originally from South Korea.   It was so exciting when South Korea knocked out Germany in 2018. I remember everyone was celebrating, especially my mum, who was screaming at the TV and clapping her hands.My dad showed me a documentary about the 2002 World Cup in Korea and Japan, when they knocked out Italy. Ji-Sung Park was really good, and he played for Manchester United, who I support. The Korean crowds were so passionate, and my parents said the atmosphere was amazing. Because this tournament is happening during the winter we might watch it with our grandparents, who know nothing about football but love watching Korea play in the World Cup. They get really emotional and excited. Most of my family is in Korea, so I visit Seoul during summer holidays. We eat tasty Korean food and go mountain hiking, as my grandma loves it. She teaches me Korean before I go to sleep as I\u2019m so bad at it. I like how advanced the technology is in Seoul. Everything is so convenient. We even got served by robots in a noodle shop in Myeongdong! Spain Nico, six, and Candela Lorenzo, 16  Nico and Candela moved from Madrid to the UK with their Spanish parents in 2019. Nico was only three and considers himself \u201calmost British\u201d, though he supports Spain. He attends London\u2019s Spanish Way FC academy twice a week. Candela loves London and says she would no longer wish to live anywhere else, though both siblings enjoy visiting family in Spain in the summer and at Christmas. Candela is a more casual football player, but a talented one. Candela I remember Spain getting knocked out of the last World Cup by Russia. It was infuriating, as we played really well, but had bad luck when it ended in a penalty shootout. I actually cried. Nico I\u2019m too young to remember much from back then, but I get very excited when I watch La Roja play. Sometimes I shout at the TV and encourage the players \u2013 I tell them off as well when I think they deserve it.  Candela Our grandad and auntie are fans of Atl\u00e9tico de Madrid, and the rest of the family supports Real Madrid, so things can get argumentative. But when they wear the Spanish shirt, the whole family gets behind La Roja. Nico I just want them to score goals and I get frustrated if they don\u2019t. I think my sister is happy if they just play a good game. Candela We\u2019ll be watching the matches together at home and preparing some Spanish food or maybe pizza. If Spain wins we\u2019ll have a proper party \u2013 invite lots of Spanish friends round and really celebrate with a big meal. Nico I\u2019ll be jumping around like crazy and shouting if we win. I think she will too, actually. Switzerland Louis Hoogenboom, nine, Vincent Hoogenboom, 12, and Eliana Hoogenboom, 16  Eliana, Vincent and Louis live in St Albans, Hertfordshire. Their mother is from Switzerland and their father from the Netherlands. Eliana was born in Basel, her siblings were both born in the UK. All three speak Italian and Dutch. Vincent I remember some of the 2018 World Cup, particularly Switzerland vs Brazil. I felt great that they drew, as Brazil is one of the strongest teams. I was happy when they qualified this year, though they\u2019ll be facing a tough group with Brazil again and Serbia. Louis It\u2019s great to see Switzerland qualify, as it\u2019s a small country, but one of the best teams \u2013 we\u2019re 15th in the Fifa rankings. Eliana The Netherlands and England have qualified, too, so all the teams I support are taking part.  Louis I am looking forward to seeing Fabian Sch\u00e4r, because he\u2019s a great team player. I think Juergen Sommer has a great focus as a goalkeeper \u2013 he doesn\u2019t let through many balls! Vincent I want to see Renato Steffen as he plays for Lugano, a club in the Italian-speaking part of Switzerland, where our mum is from. Eliana I hope we watch it with other Swiss people and maybe have raclette, a traditional melted-cheese dish. It\u2019s always nice to celebrate with other people. Vincent I was born in England, but feel very connected to Switzerland, as half of my extended family lives there \u2013 I still have two great-grandmothers. I speak weekly with my friend from Ticino [a Swiss-Italian canton], and we were recently chatting about the 1-1 draw between Switzerland and Italy in the World Cup qualifiers that prevented Italy qualifying for the World Cup. Louis I love going to Switzerland to see my family and my friends \u2013 we go there every summer and most winters. I like skiing. In Switzerland you can have the tastiest crisps in the world, especially the paprika-flavoured ones. Eliana All my friends support England, so if they ever play against Switzerland there would definitely be some friendly tension. But if Switzerland win, I would still be able to celebrate with my friends. Louis I would play my trumpet. Tunisia Ozan \u00d6zkan, 14, Haydar \u00d6zkan, 16  Haydar and \u201cOzzie\u201d were born in the UK \u2013 their mother is Tunisian and their father was Turkish (their cousin is Love Island winner Ekin-Su C\u00fclc\u00fclo\u011flu). They speak both Arabic and Turkish \u201ca little\u201d. Haydar We lived in Tunisia for about 18 months five or six years back. Ozzie We used to play football there, but we don\u2019t really any more. I was in a club for a while and played with friends \u2013 at school I\u2019d be playing every day at lunch. Haydar It\u2019s very competitive in Tunisia. The kids are always trying to trick each other during every game. It\u2019s a real challenge. Ozzie I don\u2019t think we have any friends in the UK who are supporting Tunisia \u2013 they\u2019re keeping it quiet if they do! USA Katherine Demetris, 17  Katherine was born in London in 2004, but both her parents are American. They met in London after moving to the UK in 1991, and Katherine is the youngest of their four children. Her brothers are back in the US, working or at university, and Katherine intends to attend university in the US too. My family has lived in London my whole life, and my siblings and I attended the American School in London (ASL) from the age of four \u2013 I\u2019m in my last year. I started playing football (or soccer, as we call it at ASL) when I was six.  It was hard to find an all-girls team when I was young, so I played with my brother until I joined Kinja FC, where I played from age eight to 15. Then I played on the varsity team of ASL from freshman year until now. I am privileged to be one of the captains. Before coming to ASL, and moving to Maida Vale, we lived in Chelsea, very near Stamford Bridge, so we became avid Chelsea fans. I\u2019ve also always followed the US women\u2019s team and was lucky to see them play in Paris in 2019 with my mom. I went with some of my teammates to see them play against England at Wembley in October \u2013 it was an incredible atmosphere and a great match. I\u2019m inspired by the level of women\u2019s football now and it\u2019s exciting to watch England playing so well. Being a dual citizen, I truly support both the US and England. During the 2018 World Cup, I was in Florida for the summer with my brothers and watched all the matches, supporting England all the way. We were heartbroken for them in the semi-final loss to Croatia. I am so pleased the US men\u2019s team qualified. I am bummed that the US and England are in the same pool, but I\u2019m confident they\u2019ll both be in the last 16! Uruguay Nacho Godoy, 11, and Camilo Godoy, 13  Budding footballers Camilo and Nacho live in West Wickham. They were born in the UK to a Uruguayan dad and an English mum. Their brother Santino is five, and keener on Lego than football. Camilo I remember going to a Brazilian restaurant in London to watch Uruguay v Italy for the 2014 World Cup with my dad\u2019s friends. When Godin scored to make it 1-0, the scenes were amazing. I also saw the Uruguay v Brazil friendly at the Emirates in 2018. Amazingly, they let my dad in with his candombe drum and he was on TV holding it up in the crowd.  Nacho I went to watch Uruguay in Cardiff for the Olympics in 2012, but I was just a baby so I don\u2019t remember anything. My parents invited the whole Olympic delegation to our house for an asado (barbecue) a few weeks later. The footballers had already gone home but most of the athletes took a train from the Olympic village to our house. Wherever we are in the world, if Uruguay are playing, my dad finds somewhere to watch it. There\u2019s a photo of me and Cami in San Sebasti\u00e1n in Spain in our Uruguay shirts watching a Copa Am\u00e9rica match. The Uruguayans we know in England are all friends my dad has made since living here. They are incredibly fun. The thing I like about Uruguayan culture is that kids are allowed to go to parties, and there is always barbecued meat and somebody ready to kick a football around.  Camilo For the 2014 World Cup, we often had parties at our house for all the Uruguayans in London. As it was summer, we would always have an asado. My grandad is English, and he came to watch Uruguay beat England at our house. We watched the 2018 World Cup at home because my dad was lucky enough to travel to Russia. The atmosphere wasn\u2019t the same without all the Uruguayans who usually descend on our house. When we watch Uruguay at home, we put on our shirts and decorate the house with flags. My dad loves to play the candombe drums and sing. There are videos of us as kids singing traditional football songs like Soy Celeste and banging on drums. This year we will be in Uruguay for the semi-finals onwards. Hopefully we will be watching them play the final with friends and family in Montevideo!  If Uruguay play England, I\u2019ll always support Uruguay, but if they\u2019re knocked out my support will shift to England. Wales Catrin Webb, 15, and Rhys Webb, 18  Rhys and Catrin\u2019s parents moved to south London from Crickhowell in the Brecon Beacons in 1995. Prior to that, their dad played in the Welsh Premier League for Ebbw Vale \u2013 he is now an acting head teacher, having started out in London teaching PE. The siblings regularly visit Wales, where most of their family still live. Catrin It\u2019s great that Wales qualified, but it\u2019s a pity we didn\u2019t get into the Women\u2019s World Cup. Female football doesn\u2019t get quite the same recognition, and it would have been good to promote the Welsh women\u2019s team. Rhys I\u2019d rather have qualified by beating Scotland than Ukraine. They\u2019ve robbed us of a few playoffs, especially since the 1977 Joe Jordan handball! I\u2019ve watched footage of the Wales v Brazil quarter-final game that got Wales knocked out of the 1958 World Cup \u2013 the goal was scored by a very young Pel\u00e9. Catrin There are some great players in the team. Like most Welsh people, I love Gareth Bale. But we couldn\u2019t have got there without Aaron Ramsey, Joe Allen and Chris Gunter. Rhys Some people say Gareth\u2019s lost his legs though, so to be successful in this World Cup we\u2019re going to need younger players like Neco Williams and Ethan Ampadu to showcase their talent and bring a breath of fresh air. Catrin We\u2019ve got the games in the diary already. First game against USA, then Iran the following week, then England. Rhys That\u2019s the big game, the England one. We should have people round, though it depends how we do in the two before it. Catrin It\u2019s a risk having English people round. You know: if you win, it\u2019s great; if you lose \u2026 Rhys Yeah, that\u2019s going to be miserable. Catrin It\u2019s a shame that, after 64 years, the chance of seeing Wales play live in a World Cup means having to travel to Qatar. I don\u2019t think we should support a country that\u2019s so homophobic and where women don\u2019t really have rights. Rhys I\u2019d still like to go. I mean, it\u2019s Wales in the World Cup! But it\u2019s a shame to think fans will be travelling over and not experiencing the same atmosphere our dad did when he went to Bordeaux in 2016 and saw Wales win for the first time in the Euros, against Slovakia \u2013 30,000 Welsh fans going nuts! \u2022 Research: Kitty Drake Additional research: Sundus Abdi, Francesca Hughes.

                    "body": "For the first time in the Tony Gustavsson era, the Matildas have back-to-back wins over opposition ranked in the world\u2019s top 20, running rampant in the second-half to demolish Sweden 4-0 at AAMI Park on Saturday afternoon. The victory earns the Matildas their highest-ranked scalp since a win over the United States half a decade prior and is their biggest-ever win over top-five opposition. For Gustavsson, it might have come at the expense of the land of his birth but, looking to build upon the nascent momentum from the October international window, the Matildas boss could not have asked for a better outcome.  As he raised his hands above his head to applaud the 22,065 fans in attendance, the Swedish coach might have been wondering if his side can come back to Melbourne more than once every four years. After coming under significant pressure following two disappointing defeats to Canada in September, the 49-year-old has now righted the ship \u2013 or at least bought himself some respite \u2013 with his side\u2019s current winning run, which should reach a four-game streak when his side faces Thailand on Tuesday evening. \u201cFor us, it\u2019s all about feeling good,\u201d Matildas attacker Caitlin Foord said. \u201cComing off the back of those two wins, we wanted to keep that momentum coming into this one. And we do feel good. I think we\u2019re playing the style of football we want to play. We want to be aggressive and take it to teams no matter who they are. That\u2019s what we did today and the result showed that.\u201d The Matildas were somewhat fortunate to be holding a one-goal lead at halftime thanks to Sam Kerr\u2019s 37th-minute opener. But in the second stanza they were as ruthless as they were lethal, using physicality and transition to put Bl\u00e5gult to the sword with three more goals. Caitlin Foord was rampant in securing her brace and Mary Fowler a fourth for a side looking nothing like the one that couldn\u2019t put together a full 90 minute performance against Canada the last time they played on home soil. Foord, the player of the match, has now scored five goals in her last three games for the Matildas and is suddenly her country\u2019s most in-form player at both international and domestic level. As for Kerr, by sliding in to meet a cross sent in towards the near post by Hayley Raso , she opened the scoring with her first goal for the national side since April and her first against a top-20-ranked nation since she scored against Brazil last October. More importantly for a side zeroing in on a home World Cup in less than a year, Gustavsson looks to have cemented the 4-2-4 formation attack as his side\u2019s ticket to the goals they need. Foord\u2019s move to the centre is a big part of this. It opens up new avenues of attack for the team, as exemplified by her second goal of the game (and the Matildas\u2019 fourth), a strike delivered not in transition but, instead, from a throw-in in which Foord proved pivotal at both its beginning and end. Of course there were still signs of concern and several reasons to hold off on placing an order on \u201c2023 World Cup winners\u201d decorations. As has become tradition for the Matildas when they return home, they started the game with great energy only for these promising signs to be quickly tempered. Coach Peter Gerhardsson\u2019s Swedes began to stir themselves into life around ten minutes in, increasingly creating quality chances and forays forward that left their foes scrambling to repulse. On another day, if any of these efforts had gone in, the game\u2019s dynamics might have shifted irrevocably. And the Matildas\u2019 issues with creating chances when they can\u2019t get out and run and instead have to penetrate against a set defence, as was seen here, will come under greater scrutiny. \u201cI think we struggled for 30 minutes in the first half and were lucky not to be down 1-0,\u201d said Gustavsson. \u201cI think we started off very good, the first five minutes. But after that, I think we got way too stretched and passive in our defending. \u201cThey played through us, they played around us and we could have been 1-0 down. We did a tactical adjustment [at the 30-minute mark] that worked out well. So we finished off really well.\u201d Indeed, Kerr\u2019s ability to find and redirect the ball beyond Zecira Musovic just before the halftime break proved pivotal. When a side is struggling, it needs its superstars to step up, justify their stature and prove why they\u2019re so important. That\u2019s what Kerr did in scoring the opener. It shifted the game\u2019s dynamics in a manner that set the tone for the important victory to come."

Ronaldo\u2019s position at United is considered untenable after saying in an interview that he felt \u201cbetrayed\u201d and that the Glazer family do not care about the club. The 37-year-old forward also said he has no respect for the manager, Erik ten Hag, and singled out two former United teammates, Wayne Rooney and Gary Neville, after they criticised him.  But a person with knowledge of the situation told the Associated Press on Tuesday that Glazer will have the final say on any decision to sell the forward and it will be up to Ronaldo\u2019s agent Jorge Mendes to present potential clubs willing to buy him. The source also said United\u2019s hierarchy has backed Ten Hag\u2019s handling of the player and were fully supportive of his decision to drop Ronaldo from the squad and order him to train away from the first team after the Portugal star refused to come on as a substitute against Tottenham last month. For the Premier League match against Fulham on Sunday, Ronaldo was left out of United\u2019s squad for a second game in a row after the club said he had an unspecified illness. But he trained with Portugal\u2019s national team on Tuesday as they began preparations for the World Cup in Qatar. There was widespread speculation about Ronaldo leaving United even before the season started, but a potential exit is being complicated by the limited number of clubs that can afford to meet his reported salary of around \u00a3500,000 per week.  Ronaldo has six months remaining on his contract, and United\u2019s lawyers are reviewing footage of his interview to determine the club\u2019s legal position, the person with knowledge of the situation said.  In the excerpts of the interview that were released on Sunday evening, Ronaldo is heavily critical of Ten Hag, the owning Glazer family and the club in general. \u201cI don\u2019t have respect for [Ten Hag] because he doesn\u2019t show respect for me,\u201d Ronaldo told the interviewer Piers Morgan. \u201cIf you don\u2019t have respect for me, I\u2019m never going to have respect for you.\u201d United officials have yet to see the full interview and had no knowledge that it had been conducted before excerpts started to circulate on Sunday. \u201cThe club will consider its response after the full facts have been established,\u201d United said. \u201cOur focus remains on preparing for the second half of the season and continuing the momentum, belief and togetherness being built among the players, manager, staff and fans.\u201d"

                    "body": "Every generation of Welsh football fans finds their own special moment of heartbreak. I wasn\u2019t alive to witness the great robbery of 1977 when a Maradona-grade handball decision sent Scotland to the 1978 World Cup at our expense and I was a touch too young to have my hopes and dreams brutally crushed by Paul Bodin\u2019s missed penalty of 1993, which would have taken us to USA 94. Instead, I had to wait for 2003 at the Millennium Stadium, watching Wales take on Russia for a spot at the 2004 Euros. It was a match so drab that our fans started chanting \u201cUSA, USA, USA\u201d, as though all we had to get excited about was the cold war. In the end, that chant turned out to be weirdly prescient. A few days after our 0-1 defeat, one of the Russian players, Yegor Titov, tested positive for Bromantan, a cold war-era drug allegedly used by the Russian military to give their troops extra stamina. The Welsh FA protested to Uefa, but the result was not overturned and so a new age of Wales supporters had their defining moment of pain.   Roman Igbagari and Louis Morris-Tarrant, both 11: \u2018We love wearing the hats because they are fun and support the Welsh side. Also they are bright colours!\u2019  Looking back, at least I can say that this match was memorable. There were emotions, intrigue and betrayal. Because the truth is that for every time Wales fell short with heroic misfortune, there were numerous other failures without anecdote or narrative. The only reason I know I watched Wales lose 0-1 to Georgia in 1995 was that, when I came to school the next day, my friends said they had seen me on TV. Apparently, the camera had zoomed in on me eating a huge, flappy burger that my dad had bought at half-time. As I bit down on one side of the bun, the other side flared open and all the ketchup and juices came oozing out so that \u2013 and here my friends may have been editorialising \u2013 it looked like when a boxer gets punched in the mouth, all the dangling strings of blood and saliva. My point is that I have zero recall of what happened on the pitch that day. Apparently Vinnie Jones got a red card and Georgi Kinkladze scored an elegant chip. I couldn\u2019t possibly comment. For many years, watching the Welsh football team was like this \u2013 an exercise in forgetting. These were nights on which no dreams were made.    Kofi Roberts, 30: \u2018The bucket hat represents pride and being Welsh. And we\u2019re going all the way to the final.\u2019 Tamara Roberts, 28: \u2018Wearing it shows we\u2019re thrilled at what we have achieved as a country\u2019  All of which is to say how strange it is that we find ourselves here, with Wales preparing for their third major tournament in less than a decade \u2013 and this time a World Cup. And what\u2019s more, the team projects infectious positivity as players and fans all sing Yma O Hyd, a heartfelt folk song that feels like the antithesis of your typical football singalong, not least because its first verse describes the history of our nation in the year 383. There\u2019s also the fact that football \u2013 at least when I was growing up in Swansea \u2013 was always seen as insufficiently or incorrectly Welsh, and clearly inferior to rugby. That\u2019s not the case any more. Obviously it helps that the country has a talented generation of footballers, but there\u2019s been a cultural shift, too, a sense of Welsh football finding itself.   Back row, from left: Richard Davies, 39, Tom James, 37, and Corey Glover, 26. In front: Brady Davies (left), 10, and Ollie James, 12. \u2018The hat shows other countries who we are\u2019  One symbol of that new identity is \u2013 stay with me \u2013 a garish yellow, green and red bucket hat. To borrow a phrase from Dylan Thomas, it is an ugly, lovely hat. Look at any picture of the Red Wall \u2013 as Wales\u2019s hardcore fans are known \u2013 and you\u2019ll see dozens and dozens of bucket-headed supporters so that, in fact, the wall is not just red but also daffodil-coloured. After Wales beat Ukraine to qualify for the World Cup in Qatar, the TV coverage returned to the studio where former Welsh internationals Ashley Williams and Danny Gabbidon were sitting, giggling, dressed in their three-piece suits with wincingly bright bucket hats on their heads. This was not \u2013 could not be \u2013 a matter of fashion.     Steffan Griffith, 24, and Charlotte Richards, 27: \u2018We like the way they look, plus it\u2019s fun spotting other fans.\u2019 Cath Brenton and Julie Hughes: \u2018The hat\u2019s a symbol of Welsh pride\u2019  The original hat\u2019s creator, Tim Williams, explains that for decades he travelled to watch Wales play \u2013 trips as far as Belgrade and Moscow: \u201cAll those defeats along the way, wondering if our time would ever come.\u201d He decided to start making his own shirts and hats because he was bored of wearing the same old replica kits and thought others fans might feel the same. This was in 2010 when, as he tells me from his shop in Bala, Gwynedd, \u201cWales weren\u2019t so good.\u201d He would come back from his job at a builders\u2019 merchants to stay up into the night, packing and sending out parcels. He named his company Spirit of \u201958, in reference to the last time Wales made it to a World Cup. (They played Brazil in the quarter-finals, losing to a scuffed goal by a skinny teenager called Pel\u00e9.) He says the bucket hat \u2013 inspired by his love of the Stone Roses \u2013 was \u201conly to bring a bit of colour and fun\u201d to the games. Almost apologetically, he admits, \u201cI know it\u2019s not for everyone.\u201d But \u2013 much like the team itself \u2013 the hat has gone farther than he, and anyone, expected. As the team improved, so his business picked up until one day: \u201cI came home from Bosnia [where Wales had qualified for Euro 2016] and handed in my notice for the day job.\u201d    Stacey, 37, Celt, 10, Fflur, 12, and Ceri Adams-Lewis, 45: \u2018Going to a Wales game without the hat doesn\u2019t feel right. It\u2019s become a terrace cult thing.\u2019 Viv Brooks, 76: \u2018I\u2019d like Bonnie Tyler to give a rousing team talk!\u2019  It was here, playing at their first major competition in 58 years, that Welsh football found its moment of iconography. They had reached the quarter-finals which, in itself, was hard to believe, and were now drawing 1-1 with Belgium \u2013 the highest ranked team at the tournament. On the 55th minute, Hal Robson-Kanu \u2013 a player out of contract at Championship side Reading \u2013 received the ball on the penalty spot, surrounded by defenders, at which point he performed the most elegant of feints \u2013 a Cruyff turn that wrong-footed his opponents, sending three Belgians stumbling away into oblivion \u2013 before he calmly slotted the ball home. As he ran down the sidelines grinning, the overwhelming feeling was disbelief. This was not the kind of thing that happens to us.   Back row, from left: Oliver Williams, Harvey Gray, Jesse Meacock, Toby Jones and Joshua Leonard-Cole, all 14 and players for Welsh Academy League-topping Pontardawe U14s, except for Harvey, who plays for Swansea City Academy U14s. Front row: Danny Todd (left) and Rio Gray, both 9. \u2018The hats look cool\u2019  Six years later and we are almost \u2013 almost \u2013 getting used to it. When I speak to Williams, he has just received a shipment of 500 pairs of Robson-Kanu-themed socks. He also now makes pin badges, mugs, cycling vests, bibs, beach towels and more \u2013 while the Spirit of \u201958 edition of the bucket hat sells for \u00a385 on eBay. As he explains, the hat has become a kind of homing beacon for travelling Welsh fans. \u201cWhen you\u2019re hundreds of miles away and walking down a high street, you can see it instantly,\u201d he says, \u201cand it gets everyone talking. It brings people together.\u201d This reminds me of the Welsh FA\u2019s recent marketing slogan Together, Stronger \u2013 which arguably sounds like the bland motto of a building society, except that it genuinely seems to capture an attitude among the team. Despite the range of personalities and backgrounds among the players \u2013 those who speak Welsh and those who do not, those who grew up in Wales and those who did not, those who are multimillionaire global stars and those like Kieffer Moore who, until recently, was playing non-league football while still working as a lifeguard in Truro \u2013 there is room for everyone beneath the capacious, absurd bucket hat.    Julia Ford, Ash Grove and Rosa Grove: \u2018The hat represents being a part of the group, like England have the Three Lions.\u2019 Paul Kavanagh, 50, and Robin O\u2019Brien, 27: \u2018The hat has given a kind of collective identity to us eternal underdogs! We are going to lift the Cup this year (in our bucket hats!)\u2019  And apart from this profound symbolism, let\u2019s not forget that the hat also, you know, keeps the sun off. It offers comprehensive neck coverage, which is what our fans will need in the punishing heat of Qatar as they watch Wales crush England in the groups, then make their inevitable, unstoppable progress towards the trophy. This is such a strange feeling. I\u2019m not even sure if I\u2019m joking.  Joe Dunthorne is a Welsh novelist."

                    "body": "\u201cEngland can win it,\u201d says Gary Lineker of this year\u2019s World Cup. \u201cWe need luck, we need breaks, we need all our players to find their form but we\u2019ve got a lot of exciting young players. I think we\u2019ll be competitive and I think we\u2019ll be competitive in every tournament we play now. In fact, I think we\u2019re going to have fun with England for the next 10, 12 years.\u201d\nLineker remains the ultimate football enthusiast. To talk with the 61-year-old about an event he describes as \u201cthe biggest thing going\u201d is to rekindle an unfamiliar feeling, that of excitement for a tournament that has given off more bad vibes than it is possible to count. He uses language stronger than the Guardian will publish to describe the process that ended with Qatar becoming host, says \u201cwe are stuck with it\u201d and promises the BBC\u2019s opening night of coverage will be akin to \u201ca mini-Panorama\u201d. But he is supportive of Gareth Southgate, excited for Lionel Messi and ready to back Brazil.\n\nThat Lineker has reasons to retain affection for Fifa\u2019s quadrennial jamboree is self-evident: he is indelibly associated with some of the tournament\u2019s most abiding moments. His hat-trick in Monterrey against Poland and the odds, the hand of God and the greatest goal of all time (he scored the consolation), the Golden Boot and a reprisal of that form four years later to take England to the edge of a World Cup final \u2013 \u201chave a word\u201d and all; it adds up. Lineker has done as much for the World Cup as it has done for him which, he acknowledges, is a lot.\n\u201cFinishing with the Golden Boot in Mexico, six goals, top scorer, it changed my life,\u201d he says. \u201cI was having a decent career, I was scoring lots of goals for first Leicester and then Everton, but to do it in the World Cup catapults you onto a global stage. From being only recognised in a few places in England I was now known everywhere I went.\u201d\nIf 86 was personally transformative, Italia 90 went further becoming a \u201cwatershed moment\u201d for football in this country, he says. \u201cPolitically it was a really difficult time for the country: there was concerns over hooligans travelling, Thatcher was talking about whether we should go or not. But we went and I think we then changed the perception of the sport. It wasn\u2019t just a working man\u2019s sport any more. Women were starting to get interested in football, the middle classes were starting to get interested in football, it was perhaps the seminal moment. After that we had the Taylor Report, then along came the Premier League and all of a sudden football was a better place.\u201d\n\nTwenty-eight years later and another transference of energy from an England football team to the country at large occurred. After decades of disappointment, decadence and, ultimately, disconnect, Gareth Southgate led England\u2019s men\u2019s team to their third World Cup semi-final with a group that lacked stardust but won the affection of supporters. This, in turn, led to the England coach and his players becoming more engaged in the national conversation than the generations that had preceded them. They spoke about things that mattered to them and made the case for change. Their decision to take the knee before matches at 2021\u2019s European Championship saw them win the moral argument for protesting against racial inequality over the government of the day.\nPlayers\u2019 advocacy has consistently been met with criticism, and now the same individuals are under pressure to protest against the World Cup in Qatar. Lineker, whose political interventions on Twitter have earned him an army of critics, understands the bind they are in.\n\u201cPlayers that speak out will be told to stick to football, players that don\u2019t speak out will be told to speak out,\u201d he says. \u201cYou can\u2019t generally win as a footballer in these circumstances and a lot is expected of what are very young men. They earn huge amounts of money these days and often people don\u2019t like that, but nobody seems to say anything about singers or F1 drivers. Most of the players around the England squad \u2013 Gareth is great around this as well \u2013 they do say the right things and I think they\u2019ve represented our country really well.\u201d\n\nLineker has occasionally \u2013 and notably \u2013 been known to show the edge of his tongue towards Southgate, being critical of the England manager\u2019s conservative approach to tournament competition. After a 1-0 Nations League defeat by Italy in September, he tweeted: \u201cI think Gareth Southgate\u2019s tactical master plan of not giving us any hope in order not to kill us is working beautifully thus far.\u201d\nIn person, the BBC man and co-host with Cesc F\u00e0bregas of a new World Cup podcast is more diplomatic and makes sure to be clear as to what he deems to be the baseline when it comes to the England manager. \u201cI\u2019ve put my views in there,\u201d he says, \u201c[but] I\u2019m a strong supporter of Gareth and I think whatever happens he has absolutely earned the right to succeed or fail in this World Cup. He\u2019s taken us to a semi-final of the World Cup, a final of the European championships. I would play more adventurously because I\u2019m a striker, [but] history tells us that you probably need a degree of pragmatism to win the World Cup. I understand completely how difficult and thankless a task he\u2019s got \u2026 unless he wins the thing.\u201d\n\nLineker\u2019s favourites for the tournament are Brazil, both the most successful World Cup nation and a country that hasn\u2019t seen success for two decades. \u201cIt\u2019s been 20 years since a South American team won the World Cup and if you asked me to put my head on the block and say you\u2019ve to pick someone I think I\u2019d probably pick Brazil, slightly ahead of Argentina,\u201d he says.\nThe logic of a stacked squad leads him to plump for the Sele\u00e7\u00e3o, ahead of the individual genius of the man he calls the GOAT, Lionel Messi. The admiration Lineker has for his fellow sporting great is charming and another marker of his boy scout enthusiasm. Lineker says the 35-year-old doesn\u2019t need a World Cup title to prove his greatness, but then \u201cit would probably put any argument anyone has ever had to bed\u201d so, \u201cin that sense, probably he does\u201d.\nMessi is in great form with PSG and playing in a system that suits him under Lionel Scaloni for Argentina, and Lineker says a desert triumph for the diminutive No 10 would be a fitting accolade late in his career. But as someone who has been there and been witness to much more World Cup history, Lineker is aware of the fine lines between sporting death and glory.\n\u201cPeople talk about how Maradona must be better because he won the World Cup; well, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s quite the way you should judge things,\u201d Lineker says. \u201cFor example Maradona sticks Burruchaga through against Germany late on, Burruchaga finishes [the third goal in Argentina\u2019s 3-2 victory in the 86 final]. Messi sticks through Higua\u00edn, he goes through, misses [against Germany in a 1-0 final defeat in 2014]. If Higua\u00edn scores that, the debate is already gone. What I\u2019m trying to say is: the greatest player in the world still needs a team.\u201d\nHow to Win a World Cup with Gary Lineker and Cesc F\u00e0bregas is available to listen to on Audible"

                    "body": "The prospect of an unprecedented shared T20 World Cup title is looming with an inclement weather forecast for Sunday in Melbourne threatening to wash out the final between England and Pakistan. In what would be a first for cricket, the 2022 finalists could be crowned joint world champions if rain hits the MCG as expected over the weekend and lingers into Monday. There is a 95% chance of rain in Melbourne on Sunday, with up to 25mm predicted to fall by the Bureau of Meteorology, and a chance of a possibly severe thunderstorm. Play is scheduled to start at 7pm AEDT (8am GMT) but with a washout possible, the game could spill over to the reserve day on Monday, when play would start at 3pm local time.  Unfortunately for the tournament organisers, the ICC, the forecast then is only marginally better with slightly less rainfall expected, but still with a chance of another thunderstorm. If rain prevents any prospect of play, England and a resurgent Pakistan face the bizarre situation of being forced to share the trophy in what would be an underwhelming and disappointing conclusion to the tournament. To constitute a match, a minimum of 10 overs is required per team, unlike the group stage when only five overs per side were needed to complete a game. If play starts on Sunday and is later stopped the game will resume on Monday from where it left off. Melbourne has an indoor venue, Marvel Stadium, only 5km away from the MCG but there is no chance the ICC will consider moving the game to the Docklands ground. It comes after three games at the MCG during the group stage were abandoned due to wet weather without a ball being bowled \u2013 including Australia\u2019s showdown with England \u2013 and another match was shortened because of rain."

                    "body": "Australia will face Papua New Guinea in the semi-finals of the Women\u2019s Rugby League World Cup after edging out New Zealand 10-8, thanks to Julia Robinson\u2019s late try in a tantalising tussle in York. The two old rivals locked horns in north Yorkshire to determine who would top Group B and avoid hosts England in the knockout rounds, in one of the most anticipated match-ups in either the men\u2019s or women\u2019s tournaments.  A see-sawing fixture did not disappoint. The defending champions, who had racked up 166 points and not conceded a single try in their first two games, were pushed fully to their limits but eventually emerged triumphant by a single try conversion after a brutal and thrilling encounter.  The Jillaroos had to be patient and bide their time against a brave Kiwi outfit, who stood tall and went set for set with their trans-Tasman neighbours. While their unbeaten defensive record might have gone, Australia showed character to fight back and grind out a priceless victory that has them now in the box seat to reach the final at Old Trafford on 19 November. Without a doubt it was a scare that showed they are fallible and rubbished any claims of World Cup success being a divine right. Coming back into the starting line-up after being rested in the win over France was the key troika of Sammy Bremner, captain Ali Brigginshaw and Kezie Apps. Australia needed their star power back after walkovers against the Cook Islands and France, as this was anything but easy. Only brilliant cover defence from New Zealand stopped the Jillaroos opening the scoring in the second minute. The Kiwi Ferns spent the first four minutes camped on their own try-line, but somehow managed to keep Australia at bay. The barrage didn\u2019t stop, though, with the Australians forcing goal-line dropouts and building set after set in their opponent\u2019s half. The plucky Kiwis refused to crack, and marched the Jillaroos downfield to launch their own attacks. It was a bruising, high-quality opening quarter and the first real test Australia had faced in this tournament. Finally the deadlock was broken in the 19th minute when Tarryn Aiken twisted out of two tackles to reach out and score. Brigginshaw stepped up and nailed the conversion to make it 6-0. However, New Zealand were far from overawed and 11 minutes later they hit back through Apii Nicholls. A bouncing kick from Raecene McGregor bamboozled the Australian defence and fullback Nicholls pounced. A poor conversion attempt from Brianna Clark from right in front hit the post and missed, leaving the Jillaroos two points ahead. Uncharacteristic errors from Australia meant they were unable to extend their lead in the first half. With the match delicately poised, the second half began with a Kiwi Ferns knock on from the kick off. It was the worst possible start though would not define them, as only an outstanding one-on-one tackle from Bremner stopped Kateyln Vaka\u2019aholo from crossing on the flank. It was tight, tense before the contest completely turned in the 54th minute after a brilliant ball steal from Annetta Nu\u2019uasala on Bremner. She was pulled down close to the line, but in the next tackle they shifted the ball left quickly and Autumn Rain Stephens-Daly touched down out wide. Clark crucially couldn\u2019t add the extras, but the Kiwi Ferns had poked their noses ahead 8-6. Pressure grew on the misfring Australians as the clock wound down, until Robinson replied on the flank. With 19 minutes left the winger crossed from Jess Sergis\u2019s pass to edge the Jillaroos back in front. Lauren Brown took the kicking tee but her attempt hit the crossbar. Time was running out for New Zealand and there was to be no late comeback in the climactic final minutes. However, the takeaway remains that the clunky Jillaroos have clearly been put on notice, that this World Cup is no walkover and that they will need to be much better to take the trophy back home with them."

                    "body": "  12.57pm    The match report on Pakistan\u2019s win:      12.02pm         12.00pm    So Pakistan are in the final, which takes place in Melbourne on Sunday (7pm local time, 8am in the UK). If they end up lifting the trophy, they may have to dedicate it to the cricketers of the Netherlands, without whose shock victory over South Africa Pakistan would not have reached this semi-final. But all you can do is take your chances and Babar, Rizwan and the gang took theirs superbly tonight. Tomorrow England and India meet in Adelaide to see which of them will join Pakistan in the final. Do join Rob Smyth for that game, which starts at 6.30pm local time, 8am in the UK. That\u2019s it from me \u2013 thanks for your company.      11.53am    Babar Azam pays tribute to the crowd. \u201cWe are feeling like we\u2019re playing at home!\u201d he says. \u201cEveryone is coming and cheering for Pakistan team.\u201d He gives the rest of the credit to his bowlers: \u201cWe had a good start with the ball, we have good spinners with Shadab and Nawaz bowling very well, and the fast bowlers finished very well.\u201d Modesty forbids him to dwell on his own return to form, which came at just the right time.  Updated at 12.01pm GMT    11.48am    Kane Williamson, as ever, is generous in defeat. \u201cWe were outplayed,\u201d he says. \u201cPakistan bowled really nicely, we managed to wrestle back a little bit of momentum, at half-way we felt that was a competitive total. Very disappointing to not make Pakistan work a lot harder\u2026 They certainly deserve their win.\u201d  Updated at 11.49am GMT    11.40am    Pakistan produced a superb all-round performance. The bowlers allowed New Zealand only 12 boundaries (ten fours, two sixes), with Shaheen Shah Afridi again proving to be the leader of the pack with 2-24. The other bowlers took only one wicket between them but they all kept it tight, with nobody going for more than 8.25 an over. The fielding was sharper than usual. And then Babar and Rizwan, the captain and his mate, suddenly remembered that they are the best international opening pair in the world. They put on 105 and turned a run chase into a cruise. Mohammad Haris, Pakistan\u2019s latest wonder-kid, applied the finishing touches with a nerveless 30.  Updated at 11.43am GMT    11.35am    So New Zealand, the team of the first fortnight of the tournament, are heading home. When Pakistan\u2019s openers found their form, the Kiwis had no plan B. Trent Boult was good, taking 2-33, but the other four bowlers managed only 1-113. The fielding was faulty for once and the captain, Kane Williamson, was too set in his ways, risking neither a sixth bowler nor a Test-match field. It\u2019s especially cruel for Daryl Mitchell, whose record in T20 World Cup semi-finals is unbelievable: 72 not out against England last year, 53 not out today. And that sixth bowler might well have been him.     11.28am   Pakistan reach the final!  20th over, first ball: Pakistan 153-3 (Shan Masood 3, Iftikhar Ahmed 0) Southee to bowl the final over. He starts with a wide! Oh dear. The next ball is at least on target, but Masood has no trouble pushing it for a single. Pakistan have won by seven wickets, with five balls to spare, to reach their first T20 final since 2009. The crowd are roaring, and so are the cornered tigers.      11.24am   Wicket! Haris c Allen b Santner 30 (Pakistan 151-3)  19th over: Pakistan 151-3 (Shan Masood 2) One last over of spin. Santner, bowling to the left-handed Masood, finds some sharp turn \u2013 but it misses everything and dribbles away for three byes! Cruel stuff. With two needed, Haris goes for glory and top-edges to short fine leg, but he has done his job. Pakistan need two off six balls.  Updated at 11.25am GMT    11.20am    18th over: Pakistan 145-2 (Mohammad Haris 28, Shan Masood 1) It\u2019s Lockie Ferguson, and he starts well, but then Mohammad Haris simply takes over. He\u2019s 21, playing in his fourth T20 international, and he\u2019s got sang-froid to die for. Staying deep in the crease, he hammers an off-drive for four. Then he chooses the perfect moment to hit the first six of the innings, hooking hard, high and handsome. Pakistan need only eight now off 12 balls: not even they can blow it from here.     11.15am   Wicket! Rizwan c Phillips b Boult 57 (Pakistan 132-2)  17th over: Pakistan 132-2 (Mohammad Haris 17) A fine, fighting over from Trent Boult brings a wicket, after some confusion. Rizwan slapped a high full-toss to Phillips, who caught it easily, realised it might be a no-ball, threw to the non-striker\u2019s end and got a run-out just to be sure. But it wasn\u2019t reckoned to be above waist height, rightly, because Rizwan had gone down the track. End of an excellent innings, but now New Zealand have a faint sniff. Pakistan need 21 off the last 18 balls.  Updated at 11.17am GMT    11.09am    16th over: Pakistan 127-1 (Rizwan 55, Mohammad Haris 15) And now Santner drops a catch! Williamson belatedly posted a catcher, at gully, for Southee. Haris went for the cut and Santner couldn\u2019t hold on. It was a tough chance, and it was probably New Zealand\u2019s last chance. Pakistan need 26 off 24.  Updated at 11.10am GMT    11.05am    15th over: Pakistan 122-1 (Rizwan 54, Mohammad Haris 11) Santner and Sodhi have been so incisive in this World Cup, but the force is not with them tonight. Every ball in this over goes for something, Rizwan plays a sweep for three and the spin twins have 0-49 between them off seven overs. Pakistan need only 31 off the last 30 balls.  Updated at 11.05am GMT    11.02am   Fifty to Rizwan!  14th over: Pakistan 113-1 (Rizwan 50, Mohammad Haris 6) Bodhi bowls his final over and Rizwan helps himself to a single to reach a well-judged fifty off 36 balls. He tucked into Tim Southee early on, then let Babar take over at the buffet. The scoreboard flashes up the attendance: 36,443 (more than you ever get at a game in England, where the grounds are smaller). And about 25,000 of them are having a ball because they\u2019re wearing green, like the pavilion roof.     10.57am    13th over: Pakistan 109-1 (Rizwan 48, Mohammad Haris 4) Interesting decision here, probably made by Matthew Hayden in Babar\u2019s absence: the new batter is Mohammad Haris, a fast starter, rather than an accumulator like Shan Masood. Haydos is a middle-aged man in a hurry. Haris duly whacks his second ball for four, marring a fine over from Trent Boult, who was brought back to take a wicket and did so.     10.54am   Wicket! Babar c Mitchell b Boult 53 (Pakistan 105-1)  At last! Babar succumbs to the adrenaline and plays a big hit when he didn\u2019t need to, making it easy for Mitchell at long-on. But he has done a fine job here, and it will be enough unless Pakistan produce one of the all-time great chokes.     10.50am   Hundred partnership!  12th over: Pakistan 102-0 (Rizwan 46, Babar 52) Pakistan can just about get \u2019em in singles now and one from Rizwan, pushed down the ground off Sodhi, brings up the hundred partnership. These two have been immense. Cometh the hour, cometh the pair of them.      10.46am   Fifty to Babar!  11th over: Pakistan 97-0 (Rizwan 43, Babar 50) Back comes Lockie Ferguson as Williamson acknowledges that spin hasn\u2019t worked for once. But he doesn\u2019t post the slip cordon that is surely his only way out of this now. Babar pulls for four, then adds a flick for two to reach fifty from only 36 balls, beating Rizwan to it. Before this game Babar had only 39 in the whole tournament, off 63 balls. And he was dropped first ball tonight.  Updated at 10.47am GMT    10.40am    10th over: Pakistan 87-0 (Rizwan 41, Babar 43) Just when they can\u2019t afford one more bad over, the Kiwis have one. Sodhi floats one ball up outside leg, so Rizwan plays a paddle for four. He drops another short outside off, so Babar threads a cut through the covers. That is Pakistan\u2019s 11th four, one more than New Zealand managed in twice as many overs. At the halfway stage, this has become an awful mismatch. Pakistan need only 66.      10.34am    9th over: Pakistan 75-0 (Rizwan 37, Babar 35) A decent over from Santner too, seven off it. But being decent won\u2019t do for NZ. Pakistan need just 78 now and they have 11 overs \u2013 and ten wickets \u2013 to play with. Game off!     10.32am    8th over: Pakistan 68-0 (Rizwan 32, Babar 33) Ish Sodhi joins his spin twin and bowls the best over for some time, going for just five. But Babar already has his highest score of the tournament, and he can afford to cruise because Rizwan (who has faced six balls fewer) is leading the charge. Kane Williamson is going to have to turn into Steve Waugh and set Test-match fields. Three men round the bat!  Updated at 10.32am GMT    10.28am    7th over: Pakistan 63-0 (Rizwan 30, Babar 30) Only one thing can save New Zealand now: spin. And it very nearly makes the breakthrough as Mitchell Santner appeals for LBW against Babar, Williamson reviews \u2026 and it would be plumb if it wasn\u2019t going over the stumps. In Australia, even a low-and-slow wicket can have a trampoline hidden inside it.     10.23am   Pakistan rule the powerplay  6th over: Pakistan 55-0 (Rizwan 28, Babar 25) Even the false shots are going for four now: Babar top-edges Ferguson, way over the keeper, and off it goes, trickling to the Toblerone. New Zealand hit only ten fours in their whole innings, and Pakistan have nine already. The powerplay ends with the best T20 opening pair (before this tournament) right back in business.      10.19am    5th over: Pakistan 47-0 (Rizwan 27, Babar 19) Southee changes ends and Rizwan decides to target him. He moves over to off stump and plays a crunching on-drive for four, like Viv Richards on speed. He likes it so much, he does it again next ball. Babar joins in the fun by flicking for four more. Fifteen off the over, again. Williamson has used only five bowlers in the whole tournament, so if Pakistan can hit one of them out of the attack, they should win the match.      10.14am    4th over: Pakistan 32-0 (Rizwan 18, Babar 14) Babar is getting into the groove now. Facing Lockie Ferguson, he starts with a classy off-drive, then uses the extra pace to dab through the vacant slips. Slip is a run-saving position! That\u2019s 21 off eight balls, but Ferguson puts the plug in, conceding only two off the last four.     10.09am    3rd over: Pakistan 24-0 (Rizwan 17, Babar 7) Boult, artisan that he is, can be expensive and both batters tuck into this over. Babar plays his best shot for several weeks, a flashing cover force for four. Rizwan, sensing the moment, piles in with a glance for four and a cut for four more. Fifteen off the over!      10.06am    2nd over: Pakistan 9-0 (Rizwan 7, Babar 2) The Kiwis need a strong start from their senior seamers and they get it from Tim Southee, whose first over goes for just two singles. The algorithms are giving Pakistan a 65pc chance of a win, which seems about right, although chasing has been unexpectedly tricky in this tournament.     10.02am    1st over: Pakistan 7-0 (Rizwan 6, Babar 1) It\u2019s Trent Boult to get the Pakistan innings under way, and just like New Zealand\u2019s, it begins with a bang. Mohammad Rizwan cuts the first ball for four. Boult bounces back, inducing a nick from Babar Azam \u2013 but it\u2019s dropped by Devon Conway, who has to change direction behind the stumps. Kane Williamson reacts with nothing more than a sly smile. Babar has been in such bad form that the plan may be to keep him there.   Updated at 10.17am GMT    9.51am         9.49am   NZ finish on 152  20th over: New Zealand 152-4 (Mitchell 53, Neesham 16) Naseem Shah bowls the last over and again, it\u2019s all ones and twos. Only eight off it. Pakistan must now be firm favourites, especially with the pitch (low and slow) making them feel at home. Shaheed Shah Afridi was superb, taking 2-24 off his four overs. Kane Williamson was characteristically cool and calm, possibly too much so. But let\u2019s hear it for Daryl Mitchell, who has now appeared in two T20 World Cup semi-finals and proved impregnable: 72 not out to win last year\u2019s semi against England, and 53 not out to make a game of this one against Pakistan. His temperament is made of teak.   Updated at 10.08am GMT    9.42am   Fifty to Mitchell!  19th over: New Zealand 144-4 (Mitchell 50, Neesham 14) Haris Rauf comes back for his final over. NZ are getting something off every ball, if only a leg-bye, but they\u2019re still not threatening any kind of carnage. Neesham does manage to flick a yorker for four, and Mitchell fends off a high full-toss to scamper two and reach a fine fifty, off only 32 balls. He\u2019s been head-and-shoulders above the batters who come in before him.  Updated at 9.43am GMT    9.36am    18th over: New Zealand 133-4 (Mitchell 46, Neesham 8) As Naseem Shah comes back, Mitchell spots his slower ball and lofts it over extra-cover for four. But, not for the first time this evening, the bowler recovers well and there\u2019s no second boundary in the over.  Updated at 9.43am GMT    9.31am    17th over: New Zealand 123-4 (Mitchell 38, Neesham 6) Here\u2019s Jimmy Neesham, a man who did not deserve to be on the losing side in the 2019 World Cup final. Can he reach another one? He takes one ball to play himself in, then works Shaheen\u2019s yorkers around for two, two, two. NZ need another 20 from him, and the same from Mitchell. The goods news is that, for the first time tonight, they have hitters at both ends.  Updated at 9.43am GMT    9.27am   Wicket! Williamson b Shaheen Shah Afridi 46 (NZ 117-4)  The breakthrough! One big gun removes another as Williamson walks across to the off side and Shaheen\u2019s slower ball thuds into leg stump.      9.24am    16th over: New Zealand 116-3 (Williamson 46, Mitchell 38) Pakistan\u2019s fielding, so often a talking point, has been sharp tonight \u2013 but now it\u2019s wobbling. They miss a run-out when it would have been much easier to pull it off, and then Babar himself is slow to run back from mid-off, so he fails to catch Mitchell off Haris Rauf. He may well regret that.  Updated at 9.28am GMT    9.20am    15th over: New Zealand 106-3 (Williamson 43, Mitchell 31) Back comes Shaheen Shah Afridi, the leader of the pack, looking for reverse swing. He starts with two dots to Williamson, who retorts with a whipped four to long leg. That\u2019s his first four! Incredible but true. The PA plays a burst of Crowded House, always take the weather with you. If Neil Finn played cricket, he\u2019d play like Kane Williamson.     9.14am    14th over: New Zealand 99-3 (Williamson 37, Mitchell 30) Shadab returns, the batters take four singles, one of the commentators says \u201cYou can feel something\u2019s about to happen,\u201d and it does \u2013 Mitchell brings out the shimmy again and straight-drives for six. That brings up the fifty partnership, 51 off 35 balls. But even with those two sixes, the last two overs have only gone for nine apiece, and it feels as if Pakistan are still in the driving seat.     9.11am    13th over: New Zealand 90-3 (Williamson 36, Mitchell 22) After being there for 11 and a half overs, Kane Williamson hadn\u2019t managed a single boundary (28 runs off 28 balls). He has now: Mohammad Wasim returns and his first delivery is swatted for six. Is it a pull? Is it a whip? It\u2019s definitely a great shot, though it does make you wonder why Williamson waited so long before attempting anything like it.      9.05am    12th over: New Zealand 81-3 (Williamson 28, Mitchell 21) Babar, given something to think about at last, goes back to pace and brings on Naseem Shah. NZ go back to getting \u2019em in ones and twos. The cameras give us some views of the SCG, those bright-green roofs glinting below a grey-blue sky. Of all the cricket grounds in all the world, this is the one where I would choose to watch my last game.     8.59am    11th over: New Zealand 73-3 (Williamson 24, Mitchell 18) Mitchell is dancing round his crease, itching to go big. He cuts Shadab, uppishly, and somehow squeezes the ball between the two men at backward point. A much-needed four. And then another, as Mitchell waits till the last second before dashing down the track and playing a lofted straight drive. That\u2019s 14 off the over. Reports of NZ\u2019s demise may have been exaggerated.  Updated at 8.59am GMT    8.53am    10th over: New Zealand 59-3 (Williamson 23, Mitchell 5) Williamson is working it around, classy as ever, but he\u2019s not worrying Pakistan. Nawaz\u2019s second over is all singles until Daryl Mitchell goes down the track and manufactures a two. At the halfway stage, NZ are heading for 150 rather than 200, and Pakistan are heading for the final.     8.49am    9th over: New Zealand 52-3 (Williamson 20, Mitchell 1) Plus, Pakistan keep taking wickets off the last ball of the over, which means they can whizz through the next one while the new batter plays himself in. This over from Shadab goes for just three singles, and NZ are in a spin: three overs of the slow stuff, 14 runs, one wicket.     8.46am    8th over: New Zealand 49-3 (Williamson 18) So it\u2019s spin at both ends, as so often in Sydney, and both spinners have already taken a wicket. Pakistan on top.     8.45am   Wicket!! Phillips c&amp;b Nawaz 6 (NZ 49-3)  The big one! Phillips tries to whip Nawaz\u2019s slow left-arm to leg, but gets a thick leading edge and gives the bowler a Christmas gift of a catch.  Updated at 8.55am GMT    8.41am    7th over: New Zealand 44-2 (Williamson 14, Phillips 5) No sooner has Shadab pulled off that run-out than he has to come on to bowl his leg-breaks. No rest for the gifted. He keeps it tight apart from a googly that\u2019s too short, allowing Phillips to late-cut for four.     8.38am    6th over: New Zealand 38-2 (Williamson 13) So the powerplay ends with Pakistan ahead on points, but NZ avoiding the third wicket that so often spells doom. Shaun Pollock feels that the ball is keeping low, and a graphic backs him up \u2013 the average bounce has been about one ball diameter lower than in the other five games at the SCG, which may mean that 180 is a good score.  Updated at 8.42am GMT    8.36am   Wicket! Conway run out (Shadab) 21 (NZ 38-2)  Conway, seeing the need to go big, charges Rauf\u2019s first ball and chips it for four, inside-out. Shot! But soon there\u2019s a direct hit and the Pakistan players begin to celebrate \u2026 They\u2019re right! The dangerous Conway dismissed by the dead-eye Shadab, proving Mel Jones\u2019s point.  Updated at 8.36am GMT    8.30am    5th over: New Zealand 30-1 (Conway 14, Williamson 12) Another change as Afridi gives way to Mohammad Wasim. Some of the sense of theatre goes with Afridi, but Pakistan will still be happy enough. Five singles and a two: it\u2019s as if the middle overs have started already.     8.26am    4th over: New Zealand 23-1 (Conway 11, Williamson 8) The first bowling change from Babar Azam as Haris Rauf replaces Naseem Shah. Rauf has Conway\u2019s number \u2013 he\u2019s dismissed him four times for only 29 runs. Williamson, perhaps aware of this, takes more of the strike, which makes for a quiet over. The highlight is a straight push, more of a caress, for two \u2013 would have been four but for a good half-stop at mid-on. Mel Jones, on the boundary, says she feels the game could be decided by the fielding. She\u2019s such a good commentator, confident and engaging.       8.19am    3rd over: New Zealand 19-1 (Conway 10, Williamson 5) Afridi to Williamson: feels like a big moment. Williamson, usually so serene, plays a loose uppish drive, but it\u2019s into the gap at extra cover and he picks up three. A couple of dots, then a couple of singles. Pakistan have bowled so well, yet it\u2019s still been a run a ball. NZ need to get through the next three overs with only one more wicket, to set the stage for Glenn Phillips.     8.15am    2nd over: New Zealand 14-1 (Conway 9, Williamson 1) At the other end, Naseem Shah starts strongly \u2013 line and length, dot dot dot. Conway whips one away for four, then comes very close to playing on as his back-foot dab flirts with the stumps. Then another four! It\u2019s all happening. \u201cNo idea how the match will go,\u201d says Alistair Connor, \u201cbut I\u2019m backing our twirlers (I\u2019m from NZ).\u201d They\u2019ve been so impressive. \u201cMy daughter went to work in /emigrated to (time will tell) Melbourne a couple of weeks ago. She is French but has lived in Scotland for the last six years. I suggested she should follow the creekit, as a factor of integration. She asked me for bullet points / conversation starters.\u201d Brave woman. \u201cMy suggestion to her was, if she is presenting herself as a New Zealander, she\u2019d best avoid the subject completely. If she\u2019s being French, she can just let them explain it all to her. But her boyfriend\u2019s mum is from County Down, so I suggested they should be Ireland fans.\u201d Choices, choices. I\u2019m hoping she lets them explain it all to her, then hits them with a killer stat.     8.09am    1st over: New Zealand 6-1 (Conway 1, Williamson 1) So this over went four, wicket overturned, wicket \u2026 what we need now is a single or two. Kane Williamson and Devon Conway provide them, and then, finally, there is a plain old dot. What a start: instant drama.      8.05am   Wicket! Allen LBW b Shaheen Shah Afridi 4 (NZ 4-1)  The first ball of the match is straight-driven for four by Finn Allen! But Afridi bites back with the second, a classic inswinger, and Marais Erasmus raises the finger. Reviewed and reprieved! There was an inside edge. Next ball, same again! No inside edge\u2026 It\u2019s plumb!  Updated at 8.08am GMT    8.01am    \u201cKia ora Tim,\u201d says Graeme Simpson, \u201cfrom a very nervous Aotearoa/New Zealand. Was on Eden Park with the lads after the 1992 semi as part of directing a doco on Marty Crowe.\u201d Wow. \u201cHis brother, Jeff, was the interviewer, hence, Crowe on Crowe. (Including a question about the rumours about Martin\u2019s personal life.) Some hard men in tears that afternoon. However, Martin held his composure, waved to the crowd, freeze frame, fade to black with Dire Straits\u2019 Brothers in Arms and credits. We\u2019d only started in Christchurch earlier in the week where NZ badly lost their last pool game to the Pakistanis. TVNZ had scheduled the doco for the following Tuesday, so, no sleep for the next 48 hours\u2026 RiP Marty.\u201d Absolutely. A shame he didn\u2019t live to see NZ make a habit of reaching finals.     7.58am    Time for the anthems, and some body language. The Pakistan team sing theirs with belief, hand on heart. In the crowd, the cameras find hijabs and green wigs and broad smiles. The Kiwis sing theirs with belief too, stern-faced, arm in arm. The cameras don\u2019t spot so many of their supporters.     7.53am   Pitch: not looking its best  The pitch looks not so much worn as knackered. Shaun Pollock, out there as a pundit, says: \u201cIt\u2019s jigsaw-puzzley, if you want to put it that way.\u201d Polly, it\u2019s you who wants to put it that way. And I\u2019m struggling to see what you mean. Possibly this: the pitch is in pieces, and the players will have to put it together themselves.      7.39am   Teams: both unchanged  Ch-ch-ch-changes? No thanks. NZ 1 Finn Allen, 2 Devon Conway (wkt), 3 Kane Williamson (capt), 4 Glenn Phillips, 5 Daryl Mitchell, 6 Jimmy Neesham, 7 Mitchell Santner, 8 Tim Southee, 9 Ish Sodhi, 10 Lockie Ferguson, 11 Trent Boult. Pakistan 1 Mohammad Rizwan (wkt), 2 Babar Azam (capt), 3 Mohammad Haris, 4 Shan Masood, 5 Iftikhar Ahmed, 6 Mohammad Nawaz, 7 Shadab Khan, 8 Mohammad Wasim, 9 Haris Rauf, 10 Naseem Shah, 11 Shaheen Shah Afridi.  Updated at 7.45am GMT    7.36am   NZ win toss and bat  Captains used to chase, but this tournament has changed all that. Babar Azam calls heads, it\u2019s tails, and Kane Williamson has no hesitation in saying '\u201cwe\u2019ll have a bat\u201d. There have been six games at the SCG, and five have been won by runs not wickets, including both of New Zealand\u2019s wins here.      7.00am   Preamble  Hello everyone and welcome to the first semi-final of the 2022 T20 World Cup. In five hours\u2019 time, either New Zealand or Pakistan will have booked their place in the final. On form in this tournament, it should be New Zealand \u2013 but on past form in knock-outs between these sides, they don\u2019t stand a chance. NZ will lose because \u2026 (a) they\u2019ve had three meetings with Pakistan in situations like this and lost the lot. (b) NZ, historically, are simply not as good at T20 as Pakistan, who lead them by 17 wins to 11, some way from the parity you might expect. (c) After their sorry start and sudden revival, it feels as if Pakistan are getting out their favourite moves again, the dance of the cornered tigers, 30 years on from the original. Pakistan will lose because \u2026 (a) those three previous knock-out games against NZ are distant history, the most recent being 15 years ago, which, in T20 terms, is basically Victorian times. (b) Babar Azam, usually so serene, has been having a nightmare, making scores of 0, 4, 4, 6 and 25, and not even making them fast \u2013 those 39 runs have come off 63 balls, making you wonder if he is now a Sunil Gavaskar tribute act. (c) The match is in Sydney, where the ball turns, and NZ have two of the top seven spinners in the tournament in Mitchell Santner and Ish Sodhi \u2013 two of the top five if you go by performances at the SCG, where NZ have played twice and won twice, marmalising Australia and Sri Lanka. In other words, as usual, there\u2019s no way of telling who will win. Let\u2019s just sit back and enjoy the duel between two entertaining teams, with Shaheen Shah Afridi\u2019s pace and chutzpah coming up against Glenn Phillips\u2019s penchant for sixes. The forecast, by Australia\u2019s rather soggy recent standards, is encouraging. Play starts at 7pm Sydney time, 8am in the UK, and I\u2019ll be back 25 minutes before that with the toss and the teams.  Updated at 7.39am GMT    7.00am    Tim will be here shortly. While you wait, here\u2019s Simon Burnton on Pakistan\u2019s wild ride to the semi-finals.   The first semi-final of the T20 World Cup throws together two teams whose experience of the competition so far could not have been more different. Where New Zealand\u2019s thumping victory over Australia in their opening game put them instantly in control of their group, Pakistan\u2019s presence in the final four, having lost their first two games to India and Zimbabwe, feels like a minor miracle. For the batter Shan Masood even playing in those games was extraordinary, given that during a net session before the first he was hit full on in the head by a vicious shot from Mohammad Nawaz. \u201cI took my helmet off, and I was walking across the nets to get some water, and then I heard someone saying, \u2018Watch out!\u2019 And before I could do anything I felt something hit my ear,\u201d he says. \u201cI went down, and my first thoughts were, it\u2019s hit me really hard. I thought at least it would be a fracture or something. I was taken to hospital, but when the scan came out it was just bruising. \u201cNext day I was not allowed to partake in practice, but I passed every single concussion test, I was good to go. I did not have any practice before the game but I tried to reframe it. I said, \u2018look, anything could have happened. I could have been in hospital. I could have been back home. But I\u2019m actually here and I\u2019m playing, so savour the occasion, make the most of it.\u2019\u201d   "

However, Beckham appeared in no doubt as to how much progress the country had made.\n\n\u201cQatar dreamed of bringing the World Cup to a place that it had never been before, but that it wouldn\u2019t be enough just to achieve things on the pitch,\u201d he said. \u201cThe pitch would be a platform for progress.\u201d\nHe also said: \u201cDreams can come true. That is why you are here. You share Generation Amazing\u2019s twin passions for the game of football and for making the world a more tolerant and inclusive place.\u201d\nBeckham has been increasingly criticised by LGBTQ+ groups, with Di Cunningham, co-founder of the Three Lions Pride group, last week saying he should no longer be considered a great ally because of his paid ambassador role.\nHowever, Beckham said Qatar and its ambassadors were changing lives for the better. \u201cEvery one of the great players I was lucky enough to play with started exactly the same way,\u201d he said. \u201cIn a back garden, park, or a street outside their home with just a ball and an imagination that they dared to let run wild.\n\u201cAlmost two decades ago a small group of football lovers from Qatar had an equally fantastic dream: that they could bring the greatest football show on earth to their home country and to the Middle East for the very first time.\n\u201cAnd now we are here. Because when dreams are harnessed and mixed with dedication and hard work, they are no longer dreams. They become reality.\u201d\nHe added: \u201cI want to say to all of you, \u2018today is your day to dream\u2019. Because there are no limits to what you and your teammates can achieve in our beautiful game.\n\u201cEven before this festival kicks off, more than a million lives have been touched to create an inspirational global community of coaches, educators and new young leaders. It all began as a dream. That is now yours. So please be inspired and pass it on.\u201d"

                    "body": "The World Cup has left us with two images of Lionel Messi. One is of him in his Argentinian team shirt, holding up the trophy. The other is of the emir of Qatar, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani, putting the traditional Arab men\u2019s cloak, the black bisht, round Messi, just before he receives the trophy. The second image showed the rich state, which had bought the World Cup, rubbing in the world\u2019s noses in it. It should always be an indelible reminder us of what happens when sports organisations give in to the power of money. But the other image tells a story we can all associate with. In a final that ranks as the greatest ever, the greatest player finally wins the one trophy missing from his collection and joins the pantheon of the game\u2019s legends, Pel\u00e9 and Maradona. The climaxing of the competition reminded us that football can still produce magic, mystery and enthralling drama, and provide the most unexpected twists and turns that uplift us, and, for a few brief hours, make us connect us with strangers. I first realised this in an east London pub, on the first Saturday of the tournament. Until then the World Cup had been overshadowed by the not unexpected, but nevertheless sad realisation that the sceptics were right. Far from Qatar being magically transformed into a place where migrant labourers suddenly started getting justice and LGBT rights were respected, we had to accept Qatar\u2019s ways. Harry Kane was prevented from wearing a \u201cOne Love\u201d armband, having been threatened with bookings that would have jeopardised their involvement in the tournament and the fortunes of their teams. It was against this background that I had gone to the pub to celebrate my niece\u2019s birthday, only to find that all the television screens were showing Argentina playing Mexico. Surprisingly Argentina had been beaten by Saudi Arabia in their opening game. Another defeat would have meant almost certain elimination, ending all hopes of Messi fulfilling his great dream.  For an hour, as Mexico dominated, it seemed that was just what might have happened. Then Messi, receiving a pass from just outside the box, directed a shot with such precision and delicacy that he seemed to be caressing the ball past the diving goalkeeper. I had seen him do it often but nevertheless it evoked wonder. In the pub I was suddenly part of a community, all of whom had one shared objective \u2013 for Messi to succeed. Most of us had never met, and will probably never meet again. In the weeks that followed, Messi would do this often as he showcased his bewitching skills, sometimes suggesting he had extrasensory perception. And, on Sunday night, as he lifted the trophy, a wave of happiness for him and his country swept over me. This is despite Argentina being a country I hardly know. I have always been in love with the football of their greatest rival, Brazil, and have savoured Argentinian defeats. Perhaps the World Cup was never going to change Qatar. But then there are signs that we may look back and see it as the place where the World Cup started to change into becoming a truly global event. In the near century of this competition, Europe and South America, where so many people are of European descent, have been the only two continents to win the trophy. The rest of the world was invited but never had a chance to sit at the top table. Then Morocco emerged. Its impact hit me one evening at Piccadilly Circus. Tourists admiring the Christmas lights and shoppers laden with their presents were suddenly surrounded by cars honking and streams of people draped in a flag I could not recognise. A friend who was passing by said, \u201cIt is the Spanish supporters celebrating winning.\u201d In fact it was the Moroccan supporters, whose team had just beaten Spain, one of their old colonial masters. Morocco would fall to another former colonial master, France, but became the first team from Africa to reach the semi-final. This suggested that we may be seeing a quite profound change in international football.  Unlike in my youth, when they meant discovering players from different lands, today\u2019s World Cups are essentially contests between players from European clubs who know each other well and often play for the same team. When Kane took his penalties for England against France, he faced Hugo Lloris, his captain at Tottenham. The final developed into a contest between Messi and Kylian Mbapp\u00e9, teammates at Paris Saint-Germain. It can be a wonderful \u201cplay within a play\u201d, but the thrill of exploring the unknown has gone. Morocco held out the hope that football\u2019s outsiders may finally aspire to the top table. But even as this new world finally emerges, the tragedy is that Fifa will not change. These self-appointed guardians of the game, who for decades have feasted on venality, continue to make promises they know they cannot fulfil, and instead use the wonders of Messi and others to validate themselves. The only consolation is that, for nearly four weeks, the world\u2019s footballers produced moments we will savour long after the image of Messi wearing a bisht is consigned to history.

This December, delegates will travel to Montreal, Canada, for the UN biodiversity conference, known as Cop15, to negotiate a new set of global goals for nature over the next decade after two years of delays, with the final agreement due to be reached on the eve of the World Cup final on 18 December. Presidents and prime ministers routinely attend the World Cup, but Elizabeth Maruma Mrema, executive secretary of the UN Convention on Biological Diversity, has urged world leaders to remain focused on the nature negotiations, which environmental organisations have warned are in crisis due to the lack of engagement by governments. Cop15 will start just two weeks after the end of the climate-focused Cop27 in Egypt, where countries are expected to announce stronger commitments to limit global heating to 1.5C (2.7F) above pre-industrial levels. The talks in Sharm el-Sheikh are likely to have a significant impact on the tone of the biodiversity summit. \u201cAll leaders will have to think twice [about the clash between Cop15 and the World Cup]. You can go to the World Cup but what does it mean if there\u2019s no life beyond that when you come back?\u201d said Mrema. \u201cIf they go to Qatar, then they should leave behind appropriate instructions,\u201d she added. \u201cOtherwise they will be embarrassed.\u201d Both climate and biodiversity negotiations have seen significant divisions between the global north and south. During two weeks of talks in Nairobi last month, countries struggled to make progress on the final text, and there was particular disagreement over money to fund the draft targets, implementation of the agreement and \u201cbiopiracy\u201d. Speaking to the Guardian from the UN ocean conference in Lisbon, Mrema acknowledged that progress had been slow and said input from governments in the negotiations, which are largely technical at this stage, was required to break the deadlock on big issues. \u201cWe really need a political push. Leaders are talking of a transformative, ambitious agreement. If negotiations continue this way, we will probably end up with a framework but it probably won\u2019t be ambitious, innovative or what is expected to really change the loss of biodiversity,\u201d she said. At the G7 last week, the Canadian government said both Boris Johnson and Emmanuel Macron had discussed Cop15 in meetings with the Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau.  Despite being hosted in Montreal, the summit will remain under the presidency of China, having been moved from Kunming after the country\u2019s zero-Covid policy made hosting it there impossible. Mrema said the governments would work together to deliver a Chinese Cop15 on Canadian soil.  \u201cCanada will lead in terms of ensuring we find a suitable conference venue and have all the facilities in place. But China will continue to lead the substance of the negotiations under their presidency,\u201d she said. Cop15 begins in Montreal on 5 December, with another round of negotiations scheduled before then in an attempt to break the deadlock on major issues in the agreement. The once-a decade nature agreement is scheduled for completion on the final day, 17 December, with attendance from ministers expected in the days leading up to this.

How good is Harry Souttar?\nWith that, we will wrap up our live coverage of reaction to the Socceroos historic triumph over Denmark and progression to the knockout stages of the World Cup.\nHere\u2019s a summary of everything that has happened since the final whistle:\n\nArgentina defeated Poland to secure their place as group C winners, setting up a showdown with the Socceroos. The match will happen Sunday morning Australia time. \nArgentina supremo Lionel Messi has said \u201cAustralia is going to be very difficult\u201d, though the Socceroos will enjoy underdog status for the match. \nLive viewing sites will be set up in Sydney and Adelaide for Sunday morning\u2019s match, the respective premiers have announced, bowing to pressure over questions as to why Federation Square appeared to be the only live site showing Socceroos World Cup matches in an Australian capital city. \nSocceroos fans celebrated on the streets of Melbourne and Sydney in the early hours of Thursday morning, as the team surprised the world to book Australia\u2019s place in the knockout stages of the World Cup for just the second time in the tournament\u2019s history. \n\nI\u2019ll leave you with Guardian Australia\u2019s deputy sports editor' Emma Kemp\u2019s latest despatch from Doha here\n\n\n\n\n 11.24pm  \nPerrottet announces live site for Argentina match\n\nThe New South Wales premier, Dominic Perrottet, has promised to set up an \u201cawesome\u201d live viewing site for the next Socceroos World Cup game. \nHe flagged the Sydney Opera House as a probable venue but said he would confirm later in the week. \nSpeaking at a press conference in North Sydney, he said: \n\nWe\u2019re going to have a great live site. It\u2019s going to be the best in the country because this is the best city in the world, so it\u2019s going to be awesome. \n\nHe did not know why a live site was not in place for the first games.\nPerrottet did not stay up to watch the Australian victory on Thursday morning but said he would make sure to watch the next game. \n\n\n\n 11.22pm  \n\nSocceroos fans in London:\n\n\n\n\n 11.17pm  \n\n\n\n\n\n 11.10pm  \n\nJournalist Daniel Garb from Doha:\n\n\n\n\n 11.03pm  \n\n\n\n\n\n 10.58pm  \n\nGood news for Socceroos fans in Adelaide:\nPremier Peter Malinauskas has announced a live site at Adelaide Oval will screen the round of 16 match against Argentina. \n\nAll eyes on you, Dominic Perrottet, Annastacia Palaszczuk et al. \n\n\n\n 10.44pm  \n\n\n\n\n\n 10.33pm  \n\n\u2018Now these guys are heroes\u2019: Socceroos bound into last-16 date with Argentina\nMathew Leckie\u2019s goal sank Denmark in a 1-0 win as Australia finished second in their group \u2013 now Lionel Messi\u2019s side await in this Qatar odyssey\nRead Emma Kemp\u2019s latest despatch from Doha:\n\n\n\n\n 10.22pm  \n\n\n\n\n\n 10.11pm  \nMessi: \"Australia is going to be very difficult\"\n\nArgentina supremo Lionel Messi is talking up the Socceroos\u2019 chances ahead of their knockout round clash.\n\nIs it that much of a stretch to call Australia and Argentina traditional rivals? Those with memories of the glory days of Oceania will remember the Socceroos\u2019 World Cup qualification playoff losses to Argentina.\nFor some of Argentina\u2019s players, the fixture is steeped in family history. Let us not forget that Argentina\u2019s Alexis Mac Allister will be following in his father Carlos\u2019 footsteps if he lines up against the Socceroos on Sunday morning Australia time.\nThe elder Mac Allister was part of the Argentina team that drew 1-1 with Australia in the first leg of a 1993 World Cup qualification play off that famously saw Diego Maradona play at the Sydney Football Stadium.\nLet\u2019s hope Alexis is not out for revenge!\n\nUpdated at 10.37pm GMT\n\n\n 10.00pm  \n\nUnion chief Sally McManus channeling Bob Hawke this morning:\n\n\n\n\n 9.51pm  \n\nSocceroo Jackson Irvine has praised the team chemistry as a factor in their historic progression to the World Cup knockout stages where Australia will face Argentina.\nIrvine, speaking to ABC news from Doha, said he and fellow teammates found their achievement \u201ca bit overwhelming\u201d.\nHe said:\n\n\u201cObviously emotions were running super high straight after the game and trying to kind of grasp what we have just kind of achieved. But immediately brought back down to earth by the prospect of a last 16 game in a couple of days.\nFor us as a group here, the dynamic that we have built, the environment we have, that we have curated over the last few years, we got such strong belief in each other, such a great mentality, and even after, you know, the first game, after what was a tough night, we have just bounced back and come back stronger and the individual displays that we have seen have been just so immense physically and mentally the focus in big moments\nObviously I can\u2019t speak high enough of every person involved in this camp from staff through all the players, everyone has been top notch.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n 9.49pm  \n\n\n\n\n\n 9.26pm  \nCalls for live sites for Argentina match\n\nThere are growing calls for live sites to be set up in Sydney and other capital cities to screen the Socceroos\u2019 upcoming knockout match against Argentina, as football fans across the country react, likely with jealousy, to the scenes captured at Melbourne\u2019s Federation Square this morning.\n\nA petition is already circulating for a live site in Sydney.\n\n\nUpdated at 10.38pm GMT\n\n\n 9.16pm  \n\n\u201cUnbelievable\u201d: Socceroos fans outside Al Janoub Stadium in Doha following the 1-0 victory over Denmark.\n\n\n\n\n 9.12pm  \n\nWe\u2019ve included scenes of fans celebrating in Melbourne and Sydney in an earlier post in this blog, though fans were up and at it across the country:\nThis, from Adelaide this morning:\n\n\n\n\n 9.08pm  \n\nFor those just tuning in:\n\n\n\n\n 9.04pm  \n\nMost newspapers would have had to have gone to print well before the Socceroos\u2019 victory, but over in the West the news has made the front page of the late edition of the West Australian. Trademark pun included. \n\n\n\n\n 8.56pm  \nSocceroos to play Argentina in knockout stages\n\nArgentina have defeated Poland 2-0, securing their place at the top of group C and setting up a showdown with Graham Arnold\u2019s Socceroos. \nThe round of 16 knockout match will happen early on Sunday in Australia (6am AEDT). \nWhile the Socceroos will be underdogs against Argentina, the side that includes Lionel Messi has dropped points already this campaign, losing to Saudi Arabia in their opening match.\n\n\n\n 8.51pm  \n\nPictures of fans celebrating this morning are still filtering through, and you really could look at this for days. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n 8.43pm  \n\nFor those playing along at home, the Socceroos set a handful of records in their victory over Denmark this morning: \nThis World Cup is the first time Australia has ever won two matches at any edition of the tournament. \nNot only that, it is the first time the Socceroos have scored a goal in three games at a World Cup finals. All those goals have come from open play.\nIt\u2019s also the first time Australia has kept two clean sheets at a world cup tournament. (Our clean sheet in the Tunisia match was in fact Australia\u2019s first clean sheet at a World Cup since we drew 0-0 with Chile in 1974). \n\n\n\n 8.38pm  \n\n\n\n\n\n 8.29pm  \n\nIt\u2019s looking very much like the Socceroos will be playing Argentina in their round of 16 knockout stage match on Sunday morning Australia time. \nArgentina has just gone up 2-0 against Poland, and they\u2019re now very much favourites to win group C. \n\n\n\n 8.19pm  \n\n\u201cI truly believe that the Socceroos are the team that unite the country\u201d, said Graham Arnold, vindicated. \u201cIf the cricket team get to the final of the World Cup you don\u2019t get scenes like tonight. You don\u2019t see the squares like they are tonight, and not with the rugby union or rugby league either. I\u2019m just so proud and happy. This is what World Cups are for.\u201d\nRead more from Paul MacInnes at Al Janoub Stadium:\n\n\n\n\n 8.17pm  \n\nMexico are now 2-0 up in that match\n\n\n\n 8.13pm  \n\nMexico have just taken the lead against Saudi Arabia in group C\u2019s other match. \nIn terms of what this means for the Socceroos, we\u2019re still on track to play Argentina in our next match. \nSaudi Arabia are still a chance to top the group and face Australia, however with Argentina\u2019s goal and now Mexico going ahead, that is looking far less likely. \nYou can follow the Guardian\u2019s live blog of the Saudi Arabia-Mexico match here:\n\n\n\n\n 8.09pm  \n\nArgentina take lead, on track to play Australia\nAlexis Mac Allister has just put Argentina up 1-0 in their match against Poland, scoring 68 seconds into the second half. \nThat goal takes Argentina to top spot in the live standings of group C, with Saudi Arabia and Mexico still at 0-0. \nIf those results stand, Argentina will win their group, and play the Socceroos on Sunday morning Australia time. \nYou can follow that match on the Guardian\u2019s live blog here:\n\n\n\n\n 8.05pm  \n\nThe Socceroos\u2019 hero in Doha, goalscorer Mathew Leckie, spoke after the match:\n\nI\u2019m proud, exhausted, everything really. It\u2019s hard to describe the emotions right now. We always knew we could do it as a group. We had our doubters but our spirit, our belief, our work ethic and how close we are as a group shows on the pitch. The last 15, 20 minutes we battled until the end. It didn\u2019t matter what they threw at us, we weren\u2019t conceding. We\u2019ll make the most of it tonight, but then it\u2019s all about recovery.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n 8.02pm  \n\nAfter match, Socceroos coach Graham Arnold has said his team will avoid celebrating and social media as they prepare for their upcoming round of 16 match. \nArnold said:\n\nI\u2019m just so proud of the effort by the boys. A short turnaround, but their effort was incredible. A lot of belief. A lot of hard work. These boys came in with a great mindset. We\u2019ve been working on this for four-and-a-half years, and I could see in their eyes they were ready tonight. \nNo celebrations tonight. That\u2019s why we won after a great win against Tunisia. No celebrations, no emotion, sleep, no social media.\u201d \n\n\n\n\n 7.58pm  \n\nAustralia\u2019s historic World Cup win over Denmark sparked wild celebrations across the country in the early hours of the morning as the team progressed to the knockout stages of the finals for only the second time.\nRead more:\n\n\n\n\n 7.55pm  \n\nCalls for public holiday\nAdmittedly these calls are coming from the football establishment, but still, surely something for Anthony Albanese to consider. \n\n\n\n\n\n 7.54pm  \n\nAt half time in the group C games, it\u2019s Poland 0-0 Argentina and Saudi Arabia 0-0 Mexico. \nIf these results hold, Poland will top the group, and play the Socceroos on Sunday morning Australia time. \n\n\n\n 7.49pm  \n\nMore pictures of Australians celebrating this morning\u2019s win. \n\n\n\n\n\n 7.41pm  \n\nOver in the Poland v Argentina match, Lionel Messi has just had a penalty sensationally saved by Polish keeper Wojciech Szczesny.\nAt the 41st minute mark, it\u2019s still Poland 0-0 Argentina. If that result holds and there is no change in the Saudi Arabia v Mexico match, which is also at 0-0, then Poland will win their group and face the Socceroos this weekend.\nYou can follow the Guardian\u2019s Poland v Argentina live blog here:\n\n\nUpdated at 8.09pm GMT\n\n\n 7.38pm  \nSummary\n\nIf you haven\u2019t seen it yet, here is Mathew Leckie\u2019s goal that sent the Socceroos through to the knockout stages.\nIf you\u2019ve already seen it, you\u2019ll probably want to see it again. And again.\n\n\nUpdated at 8.04pm GMT\n\n\n 7.34pm  \n\nPrime minister congratulates win\nAnthony Albanese was among those watching the Socceroos at an ungodly hour on Thursday morning.\nThe prime minister was quiet during the match, but tweeted to congratulate the team on their \u201cmagnificent\u201d win.\n\nI\u2019m reliably informed that Albo did in fact wake for the match and that it wasn\u2019t a member of his staff tweeting.\n\nUpdated at 9.22pm GMT\n\n\n 7.33pm  \n\nScenes of SBS\u2019 Eli Mengem covering fans in Federation Square celebrating Mathew Leckie\u2019s goal this morning.\n\n\nUpdated at 8.04pm GMT\n\n\n 7.27pm  \n\nWhile the Socceroos have booked their spot in the knockout stages of the World Cup, three other nations are currently battling it out in matches that will determine Australia\u2019s opponent.\nThe Socceroos will play the winner of group C on Sunday morning Australian time (6am AEDT), with Argentina, Saudi Arabia and Poland all still in contention to win their group.\nAt the 26-minute mark of group C\u2019s final matches, which are being played simultaneously, its Poland 0-0 Argentina and Saudi Arabia 0\u20130 Mexico.\nIf those results stand, Poland will top their group, and play the Socceroos. Follow both games here:\n\n\n\nUpdated at 7.31pm GMT\n\n\n 7.20pm  \nCelebrations in Melbourne, Sydney\n\nDiehard football fans may be used to it, but on Thursday, a good chunk of the country woke up (or stayed awake through) the dead of the night to watch the Socceroos play Denmark. \nIn Sydney, Melbourne and Canberra, the match kicked off at 2am local time. \nThis didn\u2019t stop tens of thousands of dedicated Australians leaving the comfort of their homes to watch the match with fellow supporters. \nIn Melbourne, scenes of flares being let off at Federation Square have gone viral this morning.\n\nMeanwhile in Sydney, which didn\u2019t have an equivalent public live site, sports bars and pubs in the city were packed to capacity and turning fans away. After the final whistle, they spilled out into the quiet dark of George Street.\n\n\nUpdated at 10.38pm GMT\n\n\n 7.10pm  \n\nHow good are the Socceroos?\nFor those who were able to sleep through the night and have just woken up, Australia have surprised the world and reached the knockout stages of the World Cup for just the second time in their history.\nFollowing a tough yet spirited 1-0 win over an attacking Denmark side, Graham Arnold\u2019s team finished second in group D to book their place in the round of 16.\nAustralia will next play either Argentina, Saudi Arabia or Poland on Sunday morning Australian time. We\u2019ll find out our opponent in just under two hours as group C\u2019s final matches are played out.\nAs the nation awakes to a historic morning, we\u2019ll be bringing you all the reaction here.\nFor a full match report, here is Emma Kemp, Guardian Australia\u2019s woman in Doha:\n\n\n"

Buttler\u2019s team travel to Adelaide for their semi-final on Thursday and will play India - if they beat Zimbabwe in the yet to be resolved Group B. Dawid Malan is a doubt but Adil Rashid is back in the wickets. Commiserations to Australia, the defending champions, who limp out at the Super-12 stage. Good bye!     11.45am    As the crowd depart into the warm Sydney evening, Ian Ward\u2019s linen jacket and T-shirt combo is looking a bit worse for wear; Eoin Morgan\u2019s shirt and jacket polite as a tablecloth at the Ritz. So England reach the semi-final \u2013 just. Surviving the rain, the defeat to Ireland and an implosion in the chase against Sri Lanka. Dasun Shanaka: \u201cYes it was an amazing fight, we could have done better in the batting part. We gave a good fight in the last ten overs \u2013 it was the power play [where they got away]. I think we played good cricket {in the tournament], we started with a few injuries, I think if the injuries were not there we could have done better. I think when we go home we have to polish up some areas. Hasaranga he has been oustanding. To be honest, power hitting is a key area that we have to get from somewhere, the catching has been problematic here, but when we look at the last year we have been outstanding. I must thank the colourful and wonderful spectators who have supported us through this World Cup and those supporters back home.\u201d Jos Buttler: \u201cThis is the kind of situation Ben [Stokes] is made for, gives you a sense of calm. He can play a lot of roles, he affects the game in all three facets and it is at this stage of competition where you see him grow and grow. Sri Lanka got off to a really good start, I think it was a fantastic over from Adil Rashid at the back of the power play to change the momentum. A lot of people always look at the end column but I don\u2019t think he\u2019s bowled with much luck, and on surfaces like this he\u2019s difficult to face. Sam Curran is someone who keeps growing and growing, a real competitor, a real method and a lot of different options. \u201cWe go to Adelaide, looking forward to whoever we play in one of the best stadiums in the world.\u201d Adil Rashid is player of the match for his 4-0-16-1, which, as Buttler said, changed the momentum when Sri Lanka looked like getting away.  Updated at 11.45am GMT    11.30am    \u201cSomeone asked earlier what the point of Stokes is,\u201d writes Robin Hazlehurst, \u201cI think this is the answer.\u201d Yes, excellently done. Mark Wood has be thrust the microphone: \u201cI can tell you I was nervous as hell with my pads on but we got there in the end. I think they [Sri Lanka] were clever, they used a lot of spin, I\u2019m sure we\u2019d be disappointed to make it so close. But Ben, who has done it before\u2026 did it again. He\u2019s a big game player, when you need him he stands up.\u201d     11.25am   England win by four wickets with two balls to spare and are through to the T20 semi-final!  19.4 overs: England 144-6 (Stokes 42, Woakes 4 ) Lahiru with the final over. Stokes takes two through cover, then gambles on the single leaving Woakes to get two from four. He can\u2019t lay bat on the first one, but he can the second, gliding four over the rope. He and Stokes remove their helmets and grin \u2013 it was always in the bag! England join New Zealand in the semi-finals, knocking out hosts Australia in the process.  Updated at 11.26am GMT    11.19am    19th over: England 137-6 (Stokes 39, Woakes 0 ) England gamble on Woakes over the hobbling Malan \u2013 though before today he hadn\u2019t batted in the World Cup. They only run one off Rajitha\u2019s first ball, could have been two actually as there was a fumble in the field. A leg bye. A full toss then an agonising wide for Rajitha. This is comfort food now. A dot and a one to finish \u2013 Stokes will be on strike for the final over, five needed from it.  Updated at 11.20am GMT    11.13am    18th over: England 129-6 (Stokes 29, Woakes 0) Three dots to start Lahiru\u2019s over, Sam Curran upper cuts nicely but only to the fielder and they pick up the one. Dawid Malan stands in the dug-out and sways nervously from side to side. The Sri Lankan crowd are dancing, the England support nibbles nails. Gnaws nails when Sam Curran\u2019s up and away gamble is superbly well snatched on the rope.     11.12am   WICKET! Curran c Kasun b Lahiru 6 (England 129-6)   Curran swirls the blade to a short one but hasn\u2019t got enough umph and the ball flies down to fine leg where Kasun holds his nerve. So\u2026.     11.07am    17th over: England 121-5 (Stokes 29, Curran 3) Tight lines from Maheesh \u2013 though gives away a wide, but England are content to pick up singles and a smartly run two through midwicket. 15 needed from 18. \u201cAs I said,\u201d writes Richard Stant, poking his head above the parapet, \u201cwe\u2019re going to do this with no worries at all. Too easy.\u201d     11.03am    16th over: England 121-5 (Stokes 29, Curran 3) Stokes starts the over with a four, what follows is sensible curation to reduce the equation to 21 from 24.     11.01am    15th over: England 113-5 (Stokes 25, Curran 0) The win predictor has dropped a little \u2013 still 90 percent to England though, perhaps on the generous side.Three off the wicket-taking over and England just need a cool head on what is a relatively simple task.  Richard Stant, they love you really, \u201c Could you let Richard Stant know there are some nice one bed apartments round the back of the Woden Storm Water Drain, where he can reflect and start to rebuild his life in solitude?\u201d Come, come Paul Griffin, England can\u2019t mess this up really. It\u2019s just a bit of jeopardy for a Saturday morning.      10.57am   WICKET! Moeen c Dasun b Dhananjaya 1  (England 111-5)   Ooops. A hesitant dab to cover where Dasun accepts the juicy cherry.     10.53am    14th over: England 110-4 (Stokes 23, Moeen 1) 32 needed off 36. Lahiru on the money. Sri Lanka\u2019s fielding is suddenly buzzing. I guess this is Ben Stokes time. \u201cThe Richard Stant effect as it may come to be known was pretty damn rapid!\u201d taps Ian Copestake.     10.49am   WICKET! Livingstone cDhananjaya b Lahiru 4  (England 106-4)  Ignore me. Liam Livingstone takes an agricultural stride and slogs Lahiru up up up and down into the hands of Dhananjaya.      10.47am    13th over: England 98-3 (Stokes 15, Livingstone 1) Nothing crosses the rope, but nothing has to: eight from the over, 36 needed from just 42. England happy to calmly make their way, it seems.     10.46am    12th over: England 98-3 (Stokes 15, Livingstone 1) Five from Wanindu\u2019s final over who finishes with 4-0-23-2.     10.44am    11th over: England 93-3 (Stokes 11, Livingstone 0) Dhananjaya . Stokes picks up his first boundary, after the fielder does all the hard work before nudging the ball over the rope in his roll; before Brook falls. This is all under control though \u2013 right?  Damn, I\u2019ve written it down somewhere but I\u2019m pretty sure they\u2019d have had to win already if they were going to top the group. If someone knows better, please tell me!     10.40am   WICKET! Brook c and  b Dhananjaya 4 (England 93-3)   A hesitant chip is collected just off the ground by the quick thinking Dhananjaya     10.36am    10th over: England 86-2 (Stokes 5, Brook 3) Two new batters at the crease but the win-predictor still gives the game to England by 95 per cent.     10.33am   WICKET! Hales  c and b Wanindu 47 (England 82-2)  From nowhere, Hales finds himself walking back to the pavilion \u2013 going for the slog sweep but instead toe-ends it back to Wanindu who accepts the early Christmas present gratefully.      10.30am    9th over: England 79-1 (Hales 46, Stokes 2 ) Dhananjaya puts the reigns on Alex Hales \u2013 six from the over and not a boundary to be had.      10.26am    8th over: England 76-1 (Hales 44, Stokes 1 ) Stokes replaces Buttler, with Malan hampered by a groin strain, as Wanindu finished his wicket-taking over with three dots.   Updated at 10.29am GMT    10.24am   WICKET! Buttler c Chamika b Wanindu 28 (England 75-1)  A beautiful diving catch by Chamika, falling through his leap and holding on in the Sydney night, as Buttler reads the wrong-un but can\u2019t get full throttle on it.     10.21am    7th over: England 74-0 (Buttler 28, Hales 43) Maheesh, in fresh royal blue boots, asserts some much-needed control.  \u201c Loving the OBO, thanks for taking the hot seat today.\u201d A complete pleasure Richard Stant.  \u201cAs a Pom living in Canberra with an Aussie wife and in-Laws I\u2019d just like to say we have this in the bag and nothing can possibly go wrong now.\u201d You know the OBO will hold you to that?!     10.19am    6th over: England 70-0 (Buttler 25, Hales 42). Now Hales takes a turn, thudding into Rajitha, six over the leg side, shooting forward his front leg and biffing for four. Four more off a low full toss. Brief respite for Sri Lanka as they review a caught behind \u2013 there is a spike but it is from bat hitting earth \u2013 then Hales ends the power play with a welly for four more. This is turning into a procession. \u201cFirst time engaging with the always excellent OBO \u2026\u201d Hello Max Bennett and welcome!\u201dOn Mark Wood crying \u2018Ginola!\u2019 when kicking the ball towards the stumps:One of my favourite things about Wood, and one that marks him out as a Magpies\u2019 fan of a certain era, is that he cries out \u2018Ginola!\u2019 when kicking the ball at the stumps with his left foot and \u2018Shearer!\u2019 with his right. It\u2019s super charming, I don\u2019t think remotely affected, and always makes me think of him as a seven year old, in the same way that his post-delivery tumbles do (until you see the readings from the speed gun, that is).\u201d      10.12am    5th over: England 50-0 (Buttler 25, Hales 22). This isn\u2019t looking good for Sri Lanka \u2013 or Australia. The taile end of Wanindu\u2019s over is brutalised, polished off with a six by Buttler over long on.     10.09am    4th over: England 38-0 (Buttler 14, Hales 21) Hales drives Lahiru perfectly, like a man in a maths test bisecting a circle, two bounces and over the rope. The next is whipped for four more. Sri Lanka must then endure a free-hit, which brings just the one with a slog. Buttler pings Lahiru up, up and away but just short of the diving Rajapaksa who ends up on the floor scrabbling for rogue potatoes from a torn brown paper bag. Buttler finishes the over by being hit in the guts.      10.02am    3rd over: England 24-0 (Buttler 11, Hales 12)  Buttler is done like a kipper by Maheesh, completely missing as the ball passes over middle stump and in \u2013 and out \u2013 of Mendis\u2019s gloves. But a lusty reply is forthcoming with four down the ground. A message wafts in from Italy. Hello Colum Fordham!:  \u201cBeginning to rue my decision to sign up to a football match in the pouring rain in the outskirts of Naples when I could have been watching England\u2019s response and enjoying the OBO in the warmth of my house. Hopefully Buttler and co will produce the fireworks which I believe are in order for the fifth of November.\u201d     9.58am    2nd over: England 15-0 (Buttler 2, Hales 12) Completely distracted by a deluge of emails on EM Foster. John Starbuck: \u201cI\u2019d have thought Oscar Wilde was a better choice: \u2018languid\u2019 positively reeks of Dorian Gray.\u201d Tim Sanders: \u201cHello Tanya, I\u2019m with Robert Lewis in the OBO E.M. Forster fan club. His characters generally have too much going on under the surface to be languid. It\u2019s the Merchant-Ivory films that perhaps polish things up a little. I think Aziz in \u2018A Passage To India\u2019 is the most likely character to stroke elegant boundaries. Lucy Honeychurch from \u2018A Room With A View\u2019 would be busy at the crease and smite the ball with passion and vigour.\u201d And Hales cracks the military medium Rajitha for four down the ground, then over extra-cover for four more.      9.53am   England start their chase  1st over: England 3-0 (Buttler 1, Hales 2) The tall Maheesh opens Sri Lanka\u2019s account, Hales, in a thick black wristband is rather stuck in his crease by the fifth and \u2013 ooof \u2013 is \u2013 I think \u2013 dropped off the last ball by Mendis behind the stumps, as the ball barely lifts off the ground and he chops inelegantly.   Beautiful!     9.48am    And the players are already back out and I haven\u2019t made another cup of coffee\u2026     9.47am    \u201cAdil Rashid,\u201d writes Tom Atkins. \u201cWho goes for *sixteen* off a full spell in a T20? Preposterous.\u201d Too true! 4-0-16-1, if you fancy. Put the breaks on when England looked as if they were losing their heads.   Updated at 9.54am GMT    9.44am     \u201cWas it my imagination or did Wood shout \u2018Ginola\u2019 as he tried to kick the ball at the stumps?\u201d asks Joseph Matthews. Damn, I didn\u2019t catch it but eagle-eyed/eared OBOers may have done\u2026      9.42am   England need 142 to win and make the T20 World Cup semi-final in Adelaide.  20th over: Sri Lanka 141-8 ( Chamika Karunaratne 0) And breathe. Rather a damp handshake of an ending to Sri Lanka\u2019s innings after they were 52 for one after five overs. Three wickets in Wood\u2019s final over, a well-deserved wicket at last for Adil Rashid and a tremendous innings from Pathum \u2013 just a shame he couldn\u2019t find much support at the end.     9.37am   WICKET!  Maheesh Theekshana c Hales b Wood 0 (Sri Lanka 141-8)  And another, as Maheesh Theekshana takes a large step backwards and has a desperate slice at Wood\u2019s last ball, it soars away and Alex Hales collects on the rope.  Updated at 9.39am GMT    9.35am   WICKET!  Wanindu run out (Wood) 9 (Sri Lanka 141-8)   WAnindu caught short as Sri Lanka desperately run a bye, nicely gathered by Wood at the bowler\u2019s end.     9.33am   WICKET! Bhanuka c Curran  b Wood 22 (Sri Lanka 140-6)  Bhanuka tries to pull Wood but is done for speed (just the 152kph), Wood hits the top of the bat and the ball loops to Sam Curran at mid-on.     9.30am    19th over: Sri Lanka 134-5 (Bhanuka 18, Wanindu 9) A flick between the ankles by Wanindu off Sam Curran\u2019s fourth ball brings a boundary, after he\u2019d served up three dots in the first four balls. But just eight from the over and Sri Lanka will be lucky to reach 150 here after an outrageous start.     9.27am    18th over: Sri Lanka 128-5 (Bhanuka 18, Wanindu 1 ) Five from the over, Mark Wood is fizzingly fast and superb at the death here.  \u201cOn behalf of the EM Forster fan club,\u201d writes Robert Lewis, \u201cI object to your description in Over 13. I think F Scott Fitzgerald would have been a more appropriate author to cite here.\u201d Surely much languid leaning in a Room with a View?      9.23am   WICKET! Dasun c Buttler b Wood 3 (Sri Lanka 127-5)  Sri Lanka faltering in the Sydney night \u2013 as a frustrated Dasun gets a feather on a Wood bullet.     9.19am    17th over: Sri Lanka 123-4 (Bhanuka 16, Dasun 2) Leg bye, one, one, dot, dot, dot. Sam Curran scurrying, hurrying, tightfisted genius.     9.18am    16th over: Sri Lanka 120-4 (Bhanuka 13, Dasun 1) A World Cup wicket for Rashid at last, after a most uncharacteristic fallow patch. Sri Lanka lose their accelerator pedal with four overs to go. Hi Tanya, \u201cHello Tim Pare!\u201dUp at the top of Sri Lanka in an auditorium for presentations about a tech innovation hub doing fantastic projects\u2026 more than just me in the audience checking in on your coverage - didn\u2019t realise Guardian cricket was so highly thought of. Fella on stage definitely confused by some of the reactions his presentation is getting.\u201d Well that is good news! Hello to everyone at the tech innovation presentation in Sri Lanka \u2013 thanks for tuning in.      9.13am   WICKET! Pathum c Jordan b Rashid 67 (Sri Lanka 118-4)  The end of a brilliant innings, smartly caught by Chris Jordan, on for the injured Dawid Malan (what a sub fielder to have) sprinting in from the rope.      9.10am   Injury for Malan  15th over: Sri Lanka 116-3 (Pathum 66, Bhanuka 13) Dawid Malan limps off the field after tweaking his groin and immediately signalling to the dressing room. As he makes his slow way round the SCG, Ben Stokes pulls off a balletic piece of fielding, sprinting, turning and throwing at full speed \u2013 and restricting a potential boundary to one run. Pathan makes the boundary a couple of balls later, through cover as the ball accelerates away from Sam Curran. And an upper-cut from Bhanuka to finish for four, effortlessly done.      9.04am    14th over: Sri Lanka 104-3 (Pathum 60, Bhanuka 7) Rashid may not have been England\u2019s wicket-taking machine in this competition, but another invaluable miserly over here, shirt untucked, quiet accuracy.      9.02am    13th over: Sri Lanka 100-3 (Pathum 57, Bhanuka 6) Pancake time \u2013 Pathum eyes up a full wide one, plumps his thigh forward and shovels Stokes into the stands for six. A few balls later, he leans languidly, like a character from EM Forster, and slices the ball over the two chasing fielders for four more.  Updated at 9.04am GMT    8.58am    12th over: Sri Lanka 89-3 (Pathum 50, Bhanuka 2) Spin doing the business here for England after Sri Lanka\u2019s initial onslaught. Five off Livingstone as Pathum moves to a superb fifty- off just 33 balls.     8.54am    11th over: Sri Lanka 84-3 (Pathum 47, Bhanuka 0) Great stuff from Stokes \u2013thudding the ball into the pitch, just three squeezed runs and a wicket.  \u201cMorning Tanya.\u201d Hello Simon McMahon! \u201cWhatever happens on the field, the Sri Lankan fans are having an absolute ball by the looks of it. All sorts of face paints, fancy dress, brass bands and drums in the stands. Tremendous stuff. Let\u2019s hope the game matches it.\u201d So true, much joy all round. And the Sydney sky is now flamed orange. If you\u2019re there, I\u2019m insanely jealous.     8.53am   WICKET! Charith c Malan b Stokes 8 (Sri Lanka 84-3)   Ben Stokes slams the ball into the dirt and Charith top-edges to a calm-as-you-like Malan.     8.48am    10th over: Sri Lanka 78-2 (Pathum 45, Charith 4) And eventually the over continues, as it began, with a single off every ball from Moeen Ali\u2019s first over \u2013 except the last. And at half way, Sri Lanka\u2019s momentum has slowed but they\u2019re still in a tasty position.     8.46am    9.3 overs over: Sri Lanka 78-2 (Pathum 45, Charith 4) The ball watching Sri Lankans escape a run-out but not injury as they collide mid-pitch in their haste. The Docs come out and while the batters are patched up, they take DRINKS.     8.41am    9th over: Sri Lanka 75-2 (Pathum 44, Charith 2) \u2013 another wicket for Sam Curran in what has been an excellent World Cup \u2013 he\u2019s the second highest wicket-taker. A wicket pocketed, and just four from the over. Apologies for being slow on the email front. Tom VD Gucht writes: \u201cEveryone seems to talk about how England just need to do enough to win. From my experience, that\u2019s fraught with danger. I remember an essay at uni only having a pass or fail grade - the pass mark was a measly 40%, so I phoned in the work thinking I\u2019d do just enough rather than slaving away when there were no 2:1\u2019s or even Desmonds on offer. Sadly, I underestimated what 40% should look like and ended up scraping through under the pass mark - spending my Easter holidays rewriting the damned thing. I worry that England might do the same and get bogged down before blowing it with a flurry of wickets when chasing a small score.\u201d     8.38am   WICKET!  Dhananjaya c Stokes b Curran ( Sri Lanka 72-2)  Dhananjaya goes for one more whallop but hasn\u2019t got the welly to cross the rope on the short side and Stokes does well, catching it sideways, keeping his feet just the right side of the boundary.      8.35am    8th over: Sri Lanka 71-1 (Pathum 43, Dhananjaya 9) Rashid is again able to strangle the scoring \u2013 six off the over.      8.34am    7th over: Sri Lanka 65-1 (Pathum 41, Dhananjaya 4) Fresh from his fielding triumph, Liam Livingstone takes the ball. All is, relatively, calm for England until the last ball, which Pathan slops over that short boundary and Chris Woakes for Six I think the answer to this is: magic team alchemy       8.29am    6th over: Sri Lanka 54-1 (Pathum 32, Dhananjaya 2) Relief for England as Buttler turns to Adil Rashid and he immediately asserts some control. Just two singles from it. And Mark Wood is back on the field.     8.27am    5th over: Sri Lanka 52-1 (Pathum 31, Dhananjaya 1) Thirteen from Sam Curran\u2019s first over, as Pathum springs onwards, unperturbed by the loss of his opening partner: a top edge over his head for four and another six, just, over the stretching Brook, slamming into the boundary.      8.24am    4th over: Sri Lanka 39-1 (Pathum 20, Dhananjaya 0 ) \u2013 Mark Wood runs off the field after that eventful over \u2013 hopefully something and nothing. And the boundary haul continues as Mendis whips Woakes square for four more. Woakes respond with a wide soaring over Mendis\u2019 head, then the breakthrough \u2013 spectacular acrobatics by Livingstone, and England needed that.     8.23am   WICKET! Mendis c  Livingstone b Woakes 18 (Sri Lanka 39-1)  As Mendis pulls\u2026. a spectacular catch by Liam Livingstone, sprinting round the boundary edge, sliding on his knees and holding on with both hands. A furious Mendis stalks off. Woakes double fist pumps.      8.16am    3rd over: Sri Lanka 32-0 (Pathum 18, Mendis 13) Mark Wood, the fastest bowler in the tournament, flashes in. Mendis doesn\u2019t bother with watchful waiting and shimmy-slams a whopper, landing rows back in the stands. Two people pose dressed as slices of water melon. Wood falls over in his follow through then Mendis picks up three more over midwicket. An an upper cut for six to finish! Just over the leaping Liam Livingstone\u2019s head. Nissanka grins.     8.10am    2nd over: Sri Lanka 15-0 (Pathum 11, Mendis 3) The camera pans up, out of the stadium, and we see the sun flaming on the horizon. It\u2019s Chris Woakes with the ball, he needs, the stats flash up, just three wickets for 150 T20 wickets. No boundaries but some smart running from Sri Lanka and an excellent dive by Alex Hales on the edge of the circle. An email, good morning Daniel Rickard!  \u201cI haven\u2019t been paying much attention to this competition, other than looking at the results, but we\u2019re basically knock out stages now so I\u2019m all in\u2026The trouble is, when you haven\u2019t been doing the build up with the wife and kids (2 of the 3 are football only, no cricket) it\u2019s hard for me and my eldest to just down tools for the whole morning out of the blue.I\u2019m sure everyone else will be fine. Come on England!!!\u201d     8.05am   Play!  1st over: Sri Lanka 9-0 (Pathum 8, Mendis 1) Ben Stokes\u2019 first ball passes safely by but Pathum pulls the second effortlessly over the short boundary for six \u2013 at just 62 metres long, it will have batters salivating this evening.     8.02am    Here come the players, Pathum Nissanka to take strike. The cameras pan round the SCG \u2013 it isn\u2019t full but there\u2019s a fair number. And my dog barks with immaculate timing because she refuses to squeeze through the back door left ajar and needs it opened for her.     7.57am    England, arms round each others shoulders, line up for the National Anthem. Some belt it out, others - Jos Buttler - prefer the letterbox mouth method. And here is Sri Lanka\u2019s jaunty tune, arms this time strictly down by their sides.     7.50am    The SCG is sooo pretty, just gazing at that gorgeous green roof in the late afternoon sun. Do send me any thoughts by the way, just making a last-minute cup of coffee. Back in five.      7.48am    And while you put the kettle on before play starts, this is a fantastic read:      7.40am    Something to gee Sri Lanka up \u2013 teams batting first have won all five games at the SCG in this World Cup. But, on the other hand, none of the Sri Lankan team have beaten England in an international T20.     7.38am   Teams  England are unchanged again, Sri Lanka make one switch, Karunaratne for Pramod Madushan. England XI: Alex Hales, Jos Buttler, Dawid Malan, Ben Stokes, Harry Brook, Moeen Ali, Liam Livingstone, Sam Curran, Chris Woakes, Adil Rashid, Mark Wood. Sri Lankan XI: :Kusal Mendis, Pathum Nissanka, Dhananjaya de Silva, Charith Asalanka, Bhanuka Rajapaksa, Dasun Shanaka , Wanindu Hasaranga, Chamika Karunratne, Maheesh Theekshana, Kasun Rajitha, Lahiru Kumara.  Updated at 7.42am GMT    7.34am   Sri Lanka win the toss and will bat  Jos Buttler and Dasun Shanaka shake hands \u2013 and Buttler says he would have batted first as well on a used pitch.     7.18am    It\u2019s a chilly old morning here in Manchester, but the crowds are gathering at the SCG where England can\u2019t expect much in the way of support from the Australian fans. Australia are out in their own backyard unless Sri Lanka can pull off a surprise. And rain, incidentally, is not England\u2019s friend.   Updated at 7.24am GMT    7.00am   Preamble  Good morning! Well here we are, after three weeks of going round the houses, it is crunch time. England and Sri Lanka meet at Sydney in a match that will decide who will hot-foot it to the semi-finals . Throw away the calculator -if England win, they are through , after Australia failed to beat Afghanistan by enough to bring run-rate into the equation. If Sri Lanka win, Australia will join New Zealand as Group One\u2019s travellers to the knock-out stages. England are buoyant, fresh from their must-win victory over New Zealand, even without this man, busy presenting shirts back home.  Sri Lanka can go no further in the tournament, but Chris Silverwood\u2019s side are more than capable of making life uncomfortable for England on a used Sydney track with a sausage factory of spinners up their sleeve. They haven\u2019t beaten England since 2014, but their autumn Asia Cup win shows they have recent history of pulling off an upset. Play starts at 8am GMT, the weather is set fair. See you there!   "

                    "body": "A World Cup works always and everywhere. There is nothing like it \u2013 and it is a diverse event. Eleven men or women are actively involved on both sides, even up to 17 due to the new rule with substitutions. All continents take part and Sunday\u2019s finalists Argentina lost in Qatar to a country from Asia \u2013 Saudi Arabia \u2013 and almost had to go into extra time against Australia. Thanks to Morocco, Africa \u2013 alternatively Arabia \u2013 made it to the semi-finals for the first time.\nAt a tournament, the world negotiates how it wants to live together. The game provides material for discussions in all directions. Was the ball out before Japan\u2019s winning goal against Spain? Can offside be measured digitally, as technology optimists believe? Is the Palestine flag political and what does it say? Was the OneLove armband necessary? What signal does it send when Muslim athletes dance with and kiss their mothers in front of the world after victories?\n\nA World Cup writes stories above all on the pitch. The most dramatic match was the replay of the 1978 final between Argentina and the Netherlands. Lionel Messi was sneaking around until the genius initiated the lead with a pass.\nArgentina dominated from then, but when the Netherlands dropped the Ajax school for a good 20 minutes and unleashed the crowbar, things took an unexpected turn. Argentina were now feeling the downside of their passionate and nationally proud style: fearing the concession of a 2-0 lead, they lost control and risked sending-offs. Had they not recovered their poise in extra time, they would have been eliminated. In the end, they won on penalties.\nQatar has witnessed the resurgence of France\u2019s Antoine Griezmann. He won the World Cup in 2018, after which his club career floundered. In the meantime, he is once again directing his side\u2019s attacking play with strategic passes and the most precise crosses. He enjoys the respect of his teammates, whom he serves unpretentiously.\nThis is not least thanks to the best footballer among the 32 coaches. Didier Deschamps would be the first coach to defend his World Cup title. Great nations should be led by great footballers \u2013 or mature personalities. Orchestrating such an accumulation of talent is a job for people such as M\u00e1rio Zagallo or Franz Beckenbauer, who, like Deschamps, became world champions as players and coaches. To integrate a supernaturally gifted player such as Kylian Mbapp\u00e9, you need their wisdom.\nIt\u2019s the \u201cwe\u201d that counts in this team sport. However, this does not preclude the \u201cI\u201d from expressing itself freely, in very different ways. Luka Modric is still, at the age of 37, the perfect midfielder because he keeps the balance of his team. Wout Weghorst almost turned the game against Argentina with his simple but effective style and then amazed the world with a free-kick trick.\nThe collective is not a dogma; football, rooted in Europe, is not totalitarian. The rules are the same for everyone, they regulate togetherness. Football is the most attractive game in the world.\n\nThere is nothing wrong with football itself. But the people who govern, manage and market it are squandering the unrestricted joy of it. They forget that they are merely service providers for a common good.\nFifa\u2019s president, Gianni Infantino, is trusted with everything. Some fans are beginning to believe that technocrats in the VAR cellars are exerting a damaging influence when they decide on penalties or calculate in millimetres whether the ball was out. Obvious mistakes such as Frank Lampard\u2019s goal that was not spotted against Germany in the 2010 World Cup last 16 should be corrected. But AI suggests an absolute justice that can never exist. And if there is a human behind the mistake, as with the 1966 Wembley goal, that is much more acceptable than if technology is wrong.\n\nA World Cup would not be complete without surprise. Morocco let themselves be carried by their fans. You can hear in their voices why football is the people\u2019s sport. And the team are the most disciplined in the tournament, managing their resources ideally. This must be based on good coaching. Walid Regragui has done an excellent job of adapting his team to the successful playing culture of the Europeans.\nNorth African football contains the elements of Sacchi, Mourinho, Guardiola, 4-3-3, Premier League and rondo. This is also true of Tunisia, who beat France in the group stage.\nThe Arab region has its football culture, which could be reinforced with a World Cup. Morocco has applied to host five times. But Fifa passed them over and awarded the tournament to Qatar, where football is seen as a political instrument. Money rules the world. Those in charge of Fifa and Uefa have too often put individual gain above the common good. \n\nEurope\u2019s institutions must be defensible in these times. It is alleged that Qatar bribed high\u2011ranking MEPs to try to influence policy. However, self-interest is no longer the order of the day, but self-preservation and resilience.\nThe next big men\u2019s football tournament, Euro 2024, will take place in a democracy, in Germany. There, what Europe is all about, namely freedom, diversity and equality before the law, must be defended. They are also the values of football.\nPhilipp Lahm\u2019s column was produced in partnership with Oliver Fritsch at Zeit Online, the German online magazine, and is being published in several European countries"
